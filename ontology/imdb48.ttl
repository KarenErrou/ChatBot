	schema:reviewBody "When I hear the word moving about a film I usually fear the worst in the form of sentimental selfindulgent tripe. This movie skilfully steers away from those perils. Lighthearted comedy and fascination for death are mixed in this truly moving film reminiscent of the alltime French classic Les jeux interdits. The storyline Tom is about ten and gets dumped on his grandfather Gaspard Jacques Villeret because his mother is dead and his father is a train driver who is ofter away and cannot give the child the attention he needs. The grandfather lives at the bottom of the very glacier that swallowed up the child's mother five years before. Tom's troubled history is manifested by problems such as dyslexia and anxiety. These sombre themes are balanced by comedy and by the endearing characters played by Laroque and Villeret. Claude Brasseur is excellent as a rather unsettling garage owner obsessed with finding the treasure hidden on the India Airways plane named Malabar Princess that crashed on the glacier fifty years earlier that much is authentic. Finding the treasure involves using dynamite and on occasions he brings back human remains to be kept in bottles. The whole script is as if seen through the eyes of a child with crude realism mixed to dreamlike fantasies. Jacques Villeret's baby face and innocent outlook further contribute to anchor the film into the world of childhood.The beauty of the mountain the great white mass of the glacier makes for beautiful images and powerful symbolism. The troubled and troubling questions of the child about what happens to people who die in a crevasse culminates in the experiment he practices on stolen chickens shut up alive in the freezer you told me my mother didn't suffer because she had a thick feather coat. Despite all this the tone is quite lighthearted and quite appropriate for viewing with children.".

The boy is at first reluctant to stay with his grandfather but over the course of the movie the affection between the two grows. The boy's mother disappeared in the Alps five years previously and the boy seems obsessed with finding out more about the circumstances of her disappearance. Is she dead? Could she still be alive? Tom goes to school in the village and makes friends with an older boy. They have adventures together as Tom tries to work out ways to get higher in the Alps to look for his lost mother.

The infamous ending of the third part of the Children of the Corn series feels like a disaster of epic proportions that kills what otherwise could be a near perfect movie. Nevertheless this movie has many good things that are worth a watch.The plot is a very good twist to the wellknown saga of He Who Walks Behind the Rows. After the horrifying events in Gatlin two brothers EliDaniel Cerny  JoshuaRon Melendez are sent to a foster house in Chicago. Their new family is very eager to have children and gives them a warm welcome but Eli  Joshua feel the cultural shock as they try to get used to the urban environment. While Joshua tries to fit in the younger Eli begins to plant corn in order to bring the cult of He Who Walks Behind the Rows to the world.It is indeed a very good script and for the most part it works. It is a huge improvement over the past sequels and in my humble opinion sometimes it even surpasses the original. Daniel Cerny's performance is outstanding and one wonders why he suddenly stopped working when he was one of the very few child actors who could give a believable performance.The eerie atmosphere is back and there are great moments of suspense and surrealistic imagery. This is what Children of the Corn movies should be. The direction is pretty good and it handles the script with perfection and lets it flow with good rhythm.If all these is so good what can be so bad that makes the movie fail in the end? Without giving spoilers let me just say that even when the SFX are topnotch for a lowbudget movie the ending pretends to be of epic proportions and ends up being one of the biggest SFX disasters ever.Don't get me wrong even with it's HUGE SFX faults it still is better than average but it breaks everything that was build up to that moment the eerie atmosphere fill with suspense turns into a savage gore fest in the style of Evil Dead but without the talent. It just feels like a different movie.Overall it's worth a rent especially for Daniel Cerny's performance who truly saves the filmno surprise that it's when he is gone that the movie falls down. It's good entertainment if you see it with a open mind.710".

Stephen King is credited as one of the writers and this is surprising to see as it is unclear if he has actually contributed to the script or this film was inspired from King's initial novel. The acting is quite mediocre but the special effects are of record tackiness with human puppets of the amazing quality of voodoo dolls. The gore factor is satisfying even unexpectedly high. The reference to environmental issues as a contemporary premise to any evil we see on screen is flimsy and ephemeral. Overall spare a few bucks to rent this on a Saturday night in with your friends and pizza.".

This movie had a great and interesting storyand as very entertaining. There were many clever deaths including the stepmother's death. The special FX were great for 1994 except for the ending..... I wanna slap the FX editor across the face! Towards the ending when the monster grabs the girl you can totally see that it was a minitaure version of her like a barbie doll you could tell by the way she moved and just the look of her she looked like plastic! But other than that it was great! Just watch out when she stabs the monster and then right when she drops the scythe close your eyes for 5 seconds. Then you won't have to see that horrible FX job. All in all it was really good other than that. I give it an 8 out of 10.".

Once there the youngest Eli begins to resurrect the bloody sacrificial cult of 'He Who Walks Behind the Rows...' The acting in this movie is almost as good as that in the original. Young Daniel Cerny in particular pulls of a masterstroke in portraying both the evil and the innocence of the manipulative Eli.The slow building of tension and suspense mirrors the nerve wracking atmosphere of the original movie while the ignorance and naivety of the parents creates a cruel feeling of vulnerability within the viewer.This movie does however have two main faults. Firstly the plot whilst simple and effective is somewhat stretchedthe bloody cult of a corn god in Chicago? Secondly the ending is somewhat silly and fantastical leaving the viewer either laughing or lamenting.My advice to fans of the genre and the original is to watch this movie. It's not that bad and for the most part is outright enjoyable. But be under no illusionthose who loathe the clich's that sometimes creep into horror movies should probably avoid this movie and see the original instead.I gave this movie a 7 out of 10. It's mostly fine good for a sequel and for fans of horror it's a fine movie. The young lead is brilliantly acted the plot simple. But for most of you this will be a waste of your time and money.".

After they move in with their foster family bad things begin to happen and people start to die in mysterious ways. And it's just a little strange that a cornfield is seeming to grow in an abandoned factory lot next door to the house... I thought this film had some creative moments and some good things to offer. Particularly I loved the death scene of the mother Amanda. I won't tell you how she dies but it was creative death scene and was very original. This is a decent movie but it begins to drop way down within the last 10 minutes. The monster at the end was so horribly fake looking it was extremely poor CGI effects. Also when the monster lifts the girl up into the air you can clearly see that it was a miniature doll that was used it looked like a Barbie. The whole monster thing was completely ridiculous and it's effects made the whole premise even worse.Anyways I enjoyed this sequel to the Children of the Corn series. It's stylish and has some good moments in it but the last 10 minutes of it were a little too much for me and almost ruined the entire movie. If you are a series fan check it out but the horrible special effects may bring the movie down. 510.".

I don't know. Son runs to his little brother who's half his size and gets him to deal with it.This is how we are introduced to the hammy acting skills of Eli and his brother Joshua. Two brothers who like all kids of Gatlin  kill their father.

Eli gets angry at his brother asking why he's not with him anymore and that he loves him so much and needs to be with him all the time and to never ever leave him. Well he doesn't exactly say that  but his eyes told me that's what he was feeling.So apparently Eli is all evil and I think the movie was trying to push across that he was the devil? They really need to stop coming up with convoluted and overreaching explanations when crazy religious kids who worship some corn demon works just fine.My favourite death was of the foster mother who tripped over a pole and impaled her skull with a piece of pipe. Awesome. The ick factor goes up slightly when you think that one of her last memories on earth were of her super young foster son tonguing her ear. Nice.As Eli starts to convert the city kids to his cracked way of thinking and to start killing off their parents  Joshua heads back to Gatlin Yay! Gatlin which must be just around the corner from Chicago to save the freaking day.While no where near as crappy as Children of the Corn 2 Final Sacrifice this only rates slightly above in terms of inventive deaths and gore. And really set in the city? It's about CORN movie people a 3 row corn 'field' at the back of an abandoned warehouse is not creepy at all. It's weird.Charlize Theron is an extra in this movie.

	schema:reviewBody "I'm a big fan of Sergio Sollima's ingenious Spaghetti Westerns and Charles Bronson is without doubt a great enrichment to any movie he played in. Sollima's Citta Violenta aka. Violent City aka. The Family of 1970 is a very good crimeaction flick with Bronson in the leading role and a great score by Ennio Morricone. The Family may not quite share the brilliance of Sollima's Westerns but it is definitely a very solid greatly acted film that no Bronson fan can afford to miss! After hit man Jeff Heston Charles Bronson is double crossed by his girlfriend Bronson's real life wife Jill Ireland and almost gets killed by rival gangsters he spends the following four years in prison. After getting out of jail he wants to track down those who betrayed him. It is not so easy however to find out who was involved in his assassination attempt and Heston has to make quite an effort to distinguish between friends and enemies.Charles Bronson is once again great as the leading character and definitely the best choice to play Jeff Heston. Telly Savalas also delivers a great performance as the boss of a crime family. Although many folks seem to think differently I also found that Jill Ireland did a great job as femme fatale Vanessa. One of the few things that were not quite necessary in Citta Violenta were the endless car chases. Car chases are of course mandatory for a film like this but when they get too long they can get a bit boring easily. The car chase sequences here are usually followed by violent action however. The movie is quite imaginatively photographed and Ennio Morricone's score is as always great and although it is a bit different to the 'typical' Morricone that we're used to from Westerns it is immediately clear who composed this soundtrack.A very well made action flick with a great leading performance by Bronson Citta Violenta is a great flick maybe not quite as essential as Sollima's Westerns but immensely entertaining atmospheric and totally badass and not to be missed by a Bronson fan. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "Now this is right up my alley a New Orleans alley full of duplicitous whores and seedy criminals. The unrivaled Charles Bronson in one of his better roles of the 1970's and as always his awkwardly wide eyed onscreenoffscreen partner Jill Ireland is along for the ride shaking her ass the whole time. People always gush over his hitman role in The Mechanic and while that character may have slightly more depth the hitman story in Violent City is far more engaging than that 1972 romp. It starts off into what you would think is a basic revenge tale but after that element is fulfilled and there is still more than an hour to go in the film the plot verges into increasingly weird and dark territory. This is an Italien production directed by Sergio Sollima and the movie has a dubbed look unfortunately. The filming is on location in New Orleans? Italy? I don't know i've never been to either place but the setting has a real vivid feel to it in particular there is one scene on an estate that is surrounded by an eerie swampland with abandoned ghost boats that always creeps me out. The musical score by Ennio Morricone adds the perfect grittydirty touch to the film and is quintessential 1970's style. R rated so there is a good dose of female nudity and some really fake but nonetheless bloody gunshot action and Bronson delivers his tough guy power play persona well by busting arms in car doors. Speaking of cars there is some superb French ConnectionBullitt style driving footage in this film makes me wish to see it in the theater. I came to this movie from being a Bronson fan not a Sergio Sollima fan and although I notice some Sollima fans on here saying this is one of his lesser pictures having seen most of Bronson's 1970's output I can say it is at least one of his best efforts. Highly recommended mainly for Bronson fans but also for 1970scinemaphiles or in general people who like a sleazy blurring of sex and violence in their movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "First of all i must admit that i'm a Charles Bronson fan and have been for quite a while. I have seen a lot of his films including all of them made after Violent City. So when i came across the movie being released on DVD and i was still yet to see it i was quick to buy it. The DVD is presented in a fantastic format trailer production and movie stills 15 minute interview with the director and cast and crew backgrounds. The movie is structured in a very unique way. Being an ItalianFrench coproduction and filmed largely in New Orleans the film consists of English and Italian dialogue to satisfy both cultures and uses flashback scenes to illustrate what is a very straightforward story of hitmen and mobsters and doublecrossings. The music score is by Ennio Morricone and as expected first rate. The cast is headed by Bronson. He doesn't talk much in this movie more so than in his other outings and uses more of a physical style of acting with many close ups on his charactaristic face. He does well as usual. Telly Savalas has a small but important role as the head of his family. His philosiphies to Bronson are interesting. And Jill Ireland as Vanessa is truly seductive. She has never looked more beautiful than in this movie and you get to see plenty of her in this version. Her acting is not great but not too bad compared to some of her later stuff with her husband. As a whole i wasn't expecting too much but Violent City is quite underrated and does have some very good scenes including a car chase a sniper scene and the very well done ending. There are no good guys in this movie but it is truthful. I give it a 7 out of 10 but i don't know if nonBronson fans would enjoy it as much. I hope they continue to put more of Charlie's films on DVD and done in a similar way. Particularly Rider On The Rain The Mechanic The Valachi Papers and the little known BronsonCurtis You Can't Win 'Em All.".

Mrs. Bronson Jill Ireland is on hand as the conniving girlfriend who along with local mafioso boss Weber Telly Savalas play him for a patsy. Entertaining enough and the readded minutes of footage in the Anchor Bay released DVD of this is very welcome. Any fellow Bronson appreciator will find nothing to complain about with this one and Jill it very well could be a body double though supplies the TA content quite nicely and multiple times. Fans of the director will be slightly offput as this isn't as good as his films that came directly before Run Man Run The Big Gundown Face to Face nor after Revolver all of which are highly recommended by me by the way. However this is still a welcome enough diversion.My Grade B".

	schema:reviewBody "Charles Bronson at his best? In a way yes but maybe no. I guess it all depends in what you want to see. An all out action film moving like a speeding car in which the opening sequence and what a beginning it is!  has a beautifully staged car chase through the slender streets of the Virgin Islands and throwing caution to the wind. Well that would be a no on that aspect. However something a little twisty within its narrative tension building through its dramatic story developments and brooding atmospherics with a watershed performance by Bronson. I would go yes. After a doublecross that leaves him for dead professional hit man Jeff survives and serves some time before tracking down the culprit  an old friend and his former mistress to New Orleans. Jeff gets revenge and his lady back but he finds himself being blackmailed by an influential crime boss Al Weber. Bronson at this period of his career was etching out a name through European productions and Violent City aka The Family happens to be one of those better enterprises. Italian director Sergio Sollima The Big Gundown Run Man Run and Revolver stylishly lays out the rough and ready groundwork like a fuse waiting to ignite. The slowtempo works due to the plots knotty structure of betrayals and doublecrossings with slice of tragedy in something of a modern western vibe and these moments are either broken up by reflective instances like splicing together flashbacks getting reactions in a game of wits between characters or relentlessly dynamic and imaginative action sequences. Sollima's crisp cinematography frames it all with remarkable long shots and showy camera angles as the visuals are simply stunning and the location work is brought live by its authentically flavoured New Orleans backdrop. Ennio Morricone composes the scorching music score which is excitingly cued with its majestically saucy edge but despite the masterful effort I thought the greatest sequences arose from the silent periods in the intensely crackling opening spectacle and climatic finale passage of the film which was beautifully unsettling. The tight screenplay keeps it sly and cynical but at the core behind its engagingly complicated plot mechanisms is a simple minded but seething revenge outlook. The acting fairsup with more of a physical but terse performance by Bronson which his silent and tough persona fitted right at home with. There's burning conviction by Jill Ireland with her tantalizingly devious turn and Terry Savalas is living it up as a powerful crime figure. Umberto Orsini and Michel Constantin are quite good too. A gritty compelling crime potboiler.".

	schema:headline " Charlie  Telly in a gritty 'n great urban western!";
	schema:reviewBody "There's absolutely no way that any movie can start off better than Violent City. Charlie Bronson on a yacht with a ravishing blond chick then moving onto land where the couple immediately gets subjected to a wild car chase through extremely narrow streets and over stairs! and ending with a violent shootout! And all this time not a single word is being spoken by anyone and all we here are the sounds of squeaking tires snorting car engines and Ennio Moricone's umpteenth fabulous soundtrack. The first ten minutes of Violent City are so damn brilliant I was even tempted to stop watching the film because I honestly feared things could only go downwards from that point ha! Luckily it didn't. Sure the pacing slowed down a bit only a little bit mind you but a great film unfolds itself with a simplistic but nevertheless compelling plot gritty atmosphere and terrific acting performances by Charles Bronson as the silent as always but deadly killer Telly Savalas as the sneering sleazy and eccentric supervillain and Jill Ireland as the bimbo who appears to screw around with half of the city. Jeff is a retiring hit man who completes one more personal killing job when a former friend doublecrosses him leaves him for dead and runs off with his lady friend. Jeff's spectacular payback executed at a race car circuit gets him noticed by the big boss of the city's organized crime network. He wants Jeff to be a part of his successful crimefamily and when he refuses an exhilarating and testosteronepacked cat and mouse game ensues. The plot isn't highly original but several independent sequences are magnificent like the aforementioned opening the intense finale or  most of all  the scene where Vanessa gets introduced to Weber Savalas in a restaurant. Sergio Sollima is a gifted director who primarily earned his fame in the spaghetti western genre The Big Gundown and Run Man Run. That's also exactly what Violent City often resembles a gritty urban western with Bronson in his familiar role of lone outlaw passing through a town where no one can be trusted. If I understood correctly the titular violent city is supposed to be Michigan where strangely everyone speaks a combination of English and Italian. Funny detail on the Dutch DVDrelease is that the dubbing is incomplete. Some of the dialogs start in English but halfway the conversation swifts to Italian and back to English again. Not at all bothering especially not in case you looked forward to this movie as much as I did.".

	schema:headline " Twofisted Charles Bronson as a hitman who sets out to take his vendetta against the villains who doublecrossed him";
	schema:reviewBody "It is an interesting dramathriller plenty of thrills  taut  intrigue  twists and turns . Jeff Heston Charles Bronson  though Tony Musante and Jon Voight were considered for the part is the number one killing people with a bullet whose reputation has caught up with him . After a bloody doublecross leaves him for dead and barely escapes a murder attempt  the professional hit man named Jeff tracks down the shooter and his gorgeous mistress Vanessa Shedon Jill Ireland  Bronson's wife  though Sharon Tate was considered and Florinda Bolkan was originally lined up to star to New Orleans . But when Jeff takes revenge  he finds himself blackmailed by a mobster Telly Savalas  who does not appear in the movie until about one hour in wants him to join his organization . Jeff refuses  and is then chased and hunted through an unforgiving city where love is like a serpent or like a loaded gun . Thrilling movie about the very deadly rivalry between two extreme contenders  a doublecrossed wealthy murderer  Charles Bronson  betrayed by his girlfriend  Jill Ireland  and a powerful crime boss  Telly Savalas . This crime thriller packs intrigue  suspense  noisy actionpacked with exciting racing cars  explosive excitement  thrills and lots of violence . United Artists cut about eight minutes from the Italian version of this film for its American release . The film relies heavily in the complex  interrelationship between a fiercely independent gunman  a mob boss  and their shared love interest . Bronson is pretty good as a killer sets out to revenge his Femme Fatal woman and the gang boss who put her up to it . He gives his usual stoic acting and displays efficiently his weapons and killing mercilessly his objectives  that's why the debts of vendetta are paid in bullets . It's certainly thrilling  though the morality may be questionable  even in this time  as the spectators were clearly on the Bronson's side in spite of being a ruthless killer . Bronson as a very professional hit man for a powerful organization offers the sort of monolithic acting  as always . This was one of the first major star teamings of action star Charles Bronson with his actress wife Jill Ireland . Jill Ireland gives a mediocre performance as Jeff's love interest  but the romance isn't what this movie is about and director knows his action . Furthermore  it appears a nice secondary cast  such as  Umberto Orsini  Ray Saunders  Michael Constantin  George Savalas  Telly's brother  and there stands out Telly Savalas who though received second billing  he gives a brief but magnificent acting . It contains atmospheric musical score composed  orchestrated and performed by the great Ennio Morricone  including an unforgettable leitmotif .The motion picture was compellingly directed by recently deceased Sergio Sollima  he even choreographed the fight scenes himself because he wanted each character to have a fighting style tailored to their personality . This movie was inspired by JeanPierre Melville's The Samurai 1967. Sergio Sollima's direction is well crafted here he's less cynical and more inclined toward violence and too much action . Sergio wrote and directed all kinds of genres such as Pirate films as Sandokan  and  Black Corsario  Peplum  Rocha  Spartacus and the Ten Gladiators  Triumph of the Ten Gladiators  Ursus Goliath Against the Giants  Thriller  Revolver 1973  Eurospy  Requiem for a Secret Agent  Agent 3S3 Hunter from the Unknown  Tanger 67  being especially known for his Cuchillo trilogy  Run Cuchillo run Face to Face  The big Gundown. And this Violent City is essential and indispensable watching for Charles Bronson fans . This is a satisfyingly violent and thrilling flick that avid fans of the genre will love .".

But when Jeff takes revenge  he finds himself blackmailed by a mobster Telly Savalas  who does not appear in the movie until about one hour in wants him to join his organization . Jeff refuses  and is then chased and hunted through an unforgiving city where love is like a serpent or like a loaded gun . Thrilling movie about the very deadly rivalry between two extreme contenders  a doublecrossed wealthy murderer  Charles Bronson  betrayed by his girlfriend  Jill Ireland  and a powerful crime boss  Telly Savalas . This crime thriller packs intrigue  suspense  noisy actionpacked with exciting racing cars  explosive excitement  thrills and lots of violence . United Artists cut about eight minutes from the Italian version of this film for its American release . The film relies heavily in the complex  interrelationship between a fiercely independent gunman  a mob boss  and their shared love interest . Bronson is pretty good as a killer sets out to revenge his Femme Fatal woman and the gang boss who put her up to it . He gives his usual stoic acting and displays efficiently his weapons and killing mercilessly his objectives  that's why the debts of vendetta are paid in bullets . It's certainly thrilling  though the morality may be questionable  even in this time  as the spectators were clearly on the Bronson's side in spite of being a ruthless killer . Bronson as a very professional hit man for a powerful organization offers the sort of monolithic acting  as always . This was one of the first major star teamings of action star Charles Bronson with his actress wife Jill Ireland . Jill Ireland gives a mediocre performance as Jeff's love interest  but the romance isn't what this movie is about and director knows his action . Furthermore  it appears a nice secondary cast  such as  Umberto Orsini  Ray Saunders  Michael Constantin  George Savalas  Telly's brother  and there stands out Telly Savalas who though received second billing  he gives a brief but magnificent acting . It contains atmospheric musical score composed  orchestrated and performed by the great Ennio Morricone  including an unforgettable leitmotif .The motion picture was compellingly directed by recently deceased Sergio Sollima  he even choreographed the fight scenes himself because he wanted each character to have a fighting style tailored to their personality . This movie was inspired by JeanPierre Melville's The Samurai 1967. Sergio Sollima's direction is well crafted here he's less cynical and more inclined toward violence and too much action . Sergio wrote and directed all kinds of genres such as Pirate films as Sandokan  and  Black Corsario  Peplum  Rocha  Spartacus and the Ten Gladiators  Triumph of the Ten Gladiators  Ursus Goliath Against the Giants  Thriller  Revolver 1973  Eurospy  Requiem for a Secret Agent  Agent 3S3 Hunter from the Unknown  Tanger 67  being especially known for his Cuchillo trilogy  Run Cuchillo run Face to Face  The big Gundown. And this Violent City is essential and indispensable watching for Charles Bronson fans . This is a satisfyingly violent and thrilling flick that avid fans of the genre will love .";

	schema:headline " PreDirty Harry but still a lesser Italian crime film";
	schema:reviewBody "I've been watching a lot of these Italian cop flicks recently but unfortunately Violent City isn't one of the best. The film was released before Dirty Harry unlike the rest of the genre so it does deserve some credit for originality. That's not to say it's bad by any means but this Charles Bronson vehicle doesn't entertain on the same level as a lot of the rest of the genre. There are certainly a lot of good things about this film but unfortunately there's also a lot of bad and the film features long stretches where little or nothing happens which certainly isn't to its credit. It's a shame really as this has the basis to be one of the best of the Italian crime films just because of the fact that it stars the 'man of few words' Charles Bronson. The plot is pretty standard stuff and focuses on a hitman that is double crossed by his friend and girlfriend. After getting out of jail he decides to take revenge on those that wronged him. However some way into his revenge he begins being blackmailed by a powerful crime boss that wants the hitman in his organisation.Charles Bronson has a lot of screen presence despite the fact that this role doesn't really suit him. His character is called 'Jeff' it's really hard to imagine the grizzled Charles Bronson being called Jeff and it's also rather difficult to imagine him having the women after him... The film's positives are luckily enough to save it from being a complete loss. The opening car chase is really good and provides the perfect opening to the film. From there we are treated to a handful of good action scenes including plenty of shooting a given since the lead character is a hitman. The sequence at the end is the best part of the film as it's both exciting and inventive and provides the perfect way for our lead character to get his revenge. The support cast isn't great and features Telly Savalas who is decent enough and Jill Ireland who looks nice throughout. However the plotting continually gets in the way and the fact that the film doesn't run smoothly greatly hinders it. Overall Violent City certainly has its moments but it's not one of the best crime films to come out of Italy during the seventies.".

	schema:headline " Bronson plans a hit eats some spaghetti";
	schema:reviewBody "Charles Bronson's tenure in Europe featured roles vastly different from his potboilers of the late 1970s and 1980s. 'Citt violenta' AKA 'Violent City' or 'The Family' is an example that was cowritten and directed by Sergio Sollima known mostly for againstthegrain thrillers and westerns. 'Violent City' is part of Bronson's sizeable rsum in international coproductions which includes the Sergio Leone epic 'Once Upon a Time in the West' and Ren Clment's 'Rider on the Rain.' The film appeared during Italy's creative shift from the giallo to the poliziottescho an overthetop crime film that depicts urban life on the brink of chaos. Effectively made and highly unpleasant 'Violent City' hits paydirt with its cast of Bronson eventual 'Kojak' star Telly Savalas and Jill Ireland who acted in over a dozen films with her husband.Filmed at excellent locations in the U.S. Virgin Islands and New Orleans 'Violent City' is vaguely similar to Bronson's 1972 drama 'The Mechanic.' Bronson plays Jeff Heston a freelance assassin who is vacationing with his lover jetsetting fashion model Vanessa Sheldon Ireland. While enjoying a quiet trip Jeff and Vanessa find themselves tailed by a band of hit men who are looking to finish Heston off. A car chase ensues in which Jeff is left for dead and Vanessa flees the scene with Coogan Michel Constantin a racecar driver who had previously hired Jeff to murder his uncle. Jeff is saved on an operating table thrown into jail on suspicion of murder and released with help from his lawyer Steve Umberto Orsini. He returns to the U.S. and asks heroinshooting investigator Killain Michel Constantin again to locate Vanessa so he can get to the bottom of things. Jeff soon finds himself in a love triangle with Vanessa and New Orleans mobster Al Weber Savalas who has since married his girlfriend.Unlike crime films by such directors as Umberto Lenzi and Ruggero Deodato that pour on the bloodshed Sollima uses action sparingly and puts greater focus on character development. The film seems to have an almost Marxist undertone in dealing with Jeff and Vanessa as peons amidst a huge game where money especially Weber's is the determining factor. All of the characters are selfserving and unlikable the only person you can really sympathize with is Vanessa who finds herself in one erotic jam after another. But even then Vanessa is a woman who continuously seeks power rather than trying to escape the cycle. The only admirable feature of Jeff Heston meanwhile is a desire for selfrespect that often loses control and translates into bloodlust.While 'Violent City' is an effective thriller it is bogged down at times by Sollima's heavyhanded overtly political style. Sollima is a skilled director who knows how to counterbalance action and character far more than others of his generation. Violent City's opening car chase is expertly filmed and leaves you breathless while later scenes gaze into the characters' psyches. However 'Violent City' has stretches of philosophizing wealth as power control of the mass media etc. that get on one's nerves. This philosophizing helps to give characters dimension but the script cowritten by Sollima and Lina Wertmller director of 'Seven Beauties' becomes too preachy for its own good. What helps to make other Spaghetti crime films effective is their fast tempo leaving wornonthesleeve philosophy in the background.Nevertheless the three lead actors play their roles solidly. Bronson is a marginal character for once and shows the range of talent that he possessed. Savalas seems to be having fun in his role as Weber taking full advantage of the wisecracks with Heston. This is also the best work I have seen from Jill Ireland largely because her role asks for more than usual. Umberto Orsini and Michel Constantin are decent as supporting actors but overshadowed by the Englishspeaking leads. 'Violent City' is competently edited by Nino Baragli and photographed by Aldo Tonti who later shot Dino Di Laurentiis's 'The Valachi Papers.' The score by Ennio Morricone is wellmade as usual although it's quite similar to his other Spaghetti crime films especially 'Milano Odia'.'Violent City' has received an excellent DVD release from Anchor Bay Entertainment it gets fine presentation with several extras and restores footage not seen in its previous English releases. The film is offered in widescreen 2.351 enhanced for 16 x 9 televisions with dubbing options in English French and Italian. Extras include a 15minute interview with Sergio Sollima a gallery of stills and posters bios of the lead cast and crew and the theatrical trailer. 'Violent City' has good print quality although colors seem a bit washed out at times artifacts and grain are rare. The original mono track is supplied with Dolby enhancement making dialogue effects and Morricone's soundtrack crystal clear.Because the restored footage was never dubbed into English it is supplied in Italian with English subtitles. This occurs at various points in the film some apparently for censorship reasons and others by decision of the filmmakers inconsequent lines were sliced from conversations between actors while racy moments were toned down such as Heston forcing himself on Vanessa. Nothing of impact was previously missing but the restored footage does help to make 'Violent City' a smoother more developed film. Overall it's an interesting project from Bronson Savalas and Ireland although its weigheddown atmosphere costs it a few points.  out of 4".

'Violent City' is part of Bronson's sizeable rsum in international coproductions which includes the Sergio Leone epic 'Once Upon a Time in the West' and Ren Clment's 'Rider on the Rain.' The film appeared during Italy's creative shift from the giallo to the poliziottescho an overthetop crime film that depicts urban life on the brink of chaos. Effectively made and highly unpleasant 'Violent City' hits paydirt with its cast of Bronson eventual 'Kojak' star Telly Savalas and Jill Ireland who acted in over a dozen films with her husband.Filmed at excellent locations in the U.S. Virgin Islands and New Orleans 'Violent City' is vaguely similar to Bronson's 1972 drama 'The Mechanic.' Bronson plays Jeff Heston a freelance assassin who is vacationing with his lover jetsetting fashion model Vanessa Sheldon Ireland. While enjoying a quiet trip Jeff and Vanessa find themselves tailed by a band of hit men who are looking to finish Heston off. A car chase ensues in which Jeff is left for dead and Vanessa flees the scene with Coogan Michel Constantin a racecar driver who had previously hired Jeff to murder his uncle. Jeff is saved on an operating table thrown into jail on suspicion of murder and released with help from his lawyer Steve Umberto Orsini. He returns to the U.S. and asks heroinshooting investigator Killain Michel Constantin again to locate Vanessa so he can get to the bottom of things. Jeff soon finds himself in a love triangle with Vanessa and New Orleans mobster Al Weber Savalas who has since married his girlfriend.Unlike crime films by such directors as Umberto Lenzi and Ruggero Deodato that pour on the bloodshed Sollima uses action sparingly and puts greater focus on character development. The film seems to have an almost Marxist undertone in dealing with Jeff and Vanessa as peons amidst a huge game where money especially Weber's is the determining factor. All of the characters are selfserving and unlikable the only person you can really sympathize with is Vanessa who finds herself in one erotic jam after another. But even then Vanessa is a woman who continuously seeks power rather than trying to escape the cycle. The only admirable feature of Jeff Heston meanwhile is a desire for selfrespect that often loses control and translates into bloodlust.While 'Violent City' is an effective thriller it is bogged down at times by Sollima's heavyhanded overtly political style. Sollima is a skilled director who knows how to counterbalance action and character far more than others of his generation. Violent City's opening car chase is expertly filmed and leaves you breathless while later scenes gaze into the characters' psyches. However 'Violent City' has stretches of philosophizing wealth as power control of the mass media etc. that get on one's nerves. This philosophizing helps to give characters dimension but the script cowritten by Sollima and Lina Wertmller director of 'Seven Beauties' becomes too preachy for its own good. What helps to make other Spaghetti crime films effective is their fast tempo leaving wornonthesleeve philosophy in the background.Nevertheless the three lead actors play their roles solidly. Bronson is a marginal character for once and shows the range of talent that he possessed. Savalas seems to be having fun in his role as Weber taking full advantage of the wisecracks with Heston. This is also the best work I have seen from Jill Ireland largely because her role asks for more than usual. Umberto Orsini and Michel Constantin are decent as supporting actors but overshadowed by the Englishspeaking leads. 'Violent City' is competently edited by Nino Baragli and photographed by Aldo Tonti who later shot Dino Di Laurentiis's 'The Valachi Papers.' The score by Ennio Morricone is wellmade as usual although it's quite similar to his other Spaghetti crime films especially 'Milano Odia'.'Violent City' has received an excellent DVD release from Anchor Bay Entertainment it gets fine presentation with several extras and restores footage not seen in its previous English releases. The film is offered in widescreen 2.351 enhanced for 16 x 9 televisions with dubbing options in English French and Italian. Extras include a 15minute interview with Sergio Sollima a gallery of stills and posters bios of the lead cast and crew and the theatrical trailer. 'Violent City' has good print quality although colors seem a bit washed out at times artifacts and grain are rare. The original mono track is supplied with Dolby enhancement making dialogue effects and Morricone's soundtrack crystal clear.Because the restored footage was never dubbed into English it is supplied in Italian with English subtitles. This occurs at various points in the film some apparently for censorship reasons and others by decision of the filmmakers inconsequent lines were sliced from conversations between actors while racy moments were toned down such as Heston forcing himself on Vanessa. Nothing of impact was previously missing but the restored footage does help to make 'Violent City' a smoother more developed film. Overall it's an interesting project from Bronson Savalas and Ireland although its weigheddown atmosphere costs it a few points.  out of 4";

Bronson is the hitman and Jill Ireland is the chick who's turned his head and after one of my favourite credit sequences ever where we see Bronson under observation to a kickass Morricone soundtrack a bunch of guys turn up to waste our stoneface killer. One car chase and a doublecross later Bronson's having bullets pulled out of him and sent to jail for a while. It gives him plenty of time to stew over what's happened. Seems the last guy who hired to him to kill someone has doublecrossed him and somehow his missus seems to be involved. Being a 'let bygones be bygones' kind of guy Bronson's first task upon being released from jail is to try and track down these two and kill them both. Luckily for us his pastemployer is also a race car driver! That gives us a lengthy sequence at a race track where Bronson scopes out a good place to take out this guy with a sniper rifle a sequence which is dialogue free and lasts about ten minutes. Also it takes place under a huge advertisement for PanAm airlines so I guess they were fitting the bill for the film or Sergio Sollima was just a big fan of that airline. Once this guy has been incinerated Bronson starts receiving pictures of him setting up the kill at the race track and realizes that starting a new life won't be so easy after allThose expecting an actionpacked film with Bronson taking down waves of bad guys would probably be better switching the film off around the ten minute mark because the film is more about Bronson brooding about his relationship with Jill Ireland and arguing with Telly Savalas a mob boss who is blackmailing Bronson and wants to hire Bronson full time. Savalas is good here as a seemingly legitbusinessman who may be telling more home truths than Bronson wishes to hear. Set possibly in New Orleans and Detroit Michigan at the same time I was a bit confused by that the film looks great sounds great and for the first half is great but be warned that pace slows way down before you get to the grim ending. Also the version I watched had eight minutes of extra footage added in Italian with English subtitles that seems to add a bit more depth to the proceedings.

Bronson God rest his soul was what every middleaged man would like to look like 2. The car chase at the start of the film is pretty darned entertaining 3. Jill Ireland God rest her soul couldn't act her way out of a wet paper bag regardless of the killer curves The rest is for you to decide upon if you're a glutton for Europunishment.";

	schema:reviewBody "Violent City is a real mixed bag. I'll start with the good. The ending is fabulous. The way our hero hitman Jeff Heston Charles Bronson gets his ultimate revenge is nothing short of sweet. His revenge comes out of nowhere and is startling when you realize what's happening. Bronson is another real bonus in the movie. Without too much dialogue he's more than capable of portraying a variety of emotions. It's a refreshing change to see Bronson smiling and running on the beach as he does in one scene. You don't see that too often. Another highlight is the car chase at the beginning of the movie. Sollima lets the movie go on for a good 15 minutes during the car chase without a single line of dialogue being spoken. The chase is the key thing. Finally Ennio Morricone's score nicely fits the action on screen. It's not his best but any Morricone score is a winner.As for the bad there are stretches of the movie where nothing happens. I was fighting to keep my eyes open during some of the middle of the movie. Another bad and I hate to say this is Jill Ireland. She's surely got to be one of the worst actresses to ever appear in film. Finally the show down between Bronson and Telly Savalas. It's over way too quick. I would have liked to see it drawn out to build the tension.Finally the ugly. If a half naked Telly Savalas doesn't classify as ugly I don't know what does.Overall the good outweighs the bad in Violent City but just barely. Without the killer ending I would have rated the movie a point or two lower.".

The State Governor therefore decides to recreate the Texas Rangers who had been disbanded after the Civil War to uphold the law. The film follows the exploits of a company of Rangers led by Leander McNelly. The villain of the story is John King Fisher the leader of a gang of outlaws who specialise in stealing cattle and then fleeing into Mexico where the stolen cattle are sold to the Mexican army. The gang are ruthless killers who have no compunction about murdering unarmed civilians in cold blood. It came as no surprise to discover that the film is loosely based on fact and that McNelly and King Fisher were real historical figures Leander McNelly did not sound like the sort of name any scriptwriter would invent for a fictitious character. The film allegedly takes some liberties with the historical record but these are unlikely to upset anyone other than experts on Texan history.Although the Texas Rangers are strictly speaking a law enforcement agency rather than a military unit the film bears more resemblance to a war movie than to a cop film. The plot is that old staple of war movies the one about the tough experienced commander who takes a group of raw recruits most of them are young men with little or no experience of guns or policing crime and turns them into a crack fighting unit. In their initial battle with the bandits the Rangers fall into a trap and many of the young and illtrained men are killed. Nevertheless they regroup attract new recruits and face off against Fisher and his men in a final showdown.The film is directed by Steve Miner previously known to me only as the man who made Lake Placid a dreadful horrorcomedy unlikely to appeal to anyone other than those who feel that there is something inherently hilarious about someone getting their head bitten off by a gigantic crocodile. Fortunately Miner makes no attempt to inject comedy elements into Texas Rangers and it is a better film than Lake Placid although that is not really saying much.The past few years have seen something of a revival of the Western genre. Many recent Westerns Dances with Wolves Unforgiven Wyatt Earp 3.10 to Yuma have been grand films made on an epic scale but Texas Rangers is a much more modest smallscale effort more reminiscent of the old Western Bmovies. Its total running time is very short for a twentyfirst century film the version I saw on British television recently only ran to eighty minutes. It is essentially a goodguysversusbadguys Western of the old school with plenty of action and gunplay but without any deep significance. There are occasional attempts to inject a note of moral ambiguity McNelly can be uncompromising in his methods but there is little doubt that he and his men wear the metaphorical white hats and the Fisher gang the black ones. This is the sort of thing that Hollywood used to churn out by the dozen in the forties and fifties. 510".

	schema:reviewBody "It's a real shame.  Texas Rangers Steve Miner's new take on the founding of the famous band of Old West law enforcers was held back from release for almost a whole year subjected to numerous reedits dumped into theatres without any fanfare and greeted with apathy and pathetic grosses.  And you know what?  It's one of the most entertaining films I've seen all year.The film stars James Van Der Beek as an upright Eastern inventor's son who on his first trip to the wild west sees his parents and brothers killed before his eyes by marauding bandits.  Desperate for revenge he enlists with the Rangers a moreorless vigilante band led by Leander McNelly Dylan McDermott an exConfederate soldier with a vendetta of his own. McNelly's band of young gunslingers battle their way across the Texas border country sniffing out bandits doling out frontier justice romancing the womenfolk etc. etc.In other words Texas Rangers does nothing you can't see in any Bwestern on Saturday afternoon TV.  It's just that it does most of it a lot better than we've seen for quite some time.  After the rather too glossy American Outlaws it's nice to get a Western with a gritty authentic look.  The towns look appropriately small and weatherbeaten the costumes nice and trailworn.  The only gloss here is on the guns...and I guess some of those young cowpokes are kind of glittery too.Miner's direction is curiously hot and cold here.  He excels in quiet moments dialogue and character but his action scenes sometimes come up short.  He seems particularly to have a bad habit of always putting his camera in the wrong place when his quick action payoffs arrive bullets hitting home knives landing on target.  Still the picture moves with lots of energy and excitement and Miner is definitely to thank for that. Also he scores in the big action climax where the Rangers storm the desperadoes' Mexican hideout.  Here the camera always finds the right spot and the result is a fast pulsequickening blowout.A fine cast gives a lot of luster to the material.  James Van Der Beek has never been just another WB pretty boy and he takes to the Western with grace and conviction.  Ashton Kutcher is okay as a hayseed gunman but at times comes off a little too much like he's still on That '70s Show. Usher Raymond is nicely understated as a formerslave ranger and while Rachael Leigh Cook's rancher's daughter is really superfluous to the plot her gorgeous face is absolutely essential.  Fine supporting turns dot the picture with standouts being Randy Travis and Robert Patrick as McNelly's lieutenants and Vincent Spano as a cocky villainous gunslinger.Really though this is Dylan McDermott's show.  I have never been much of a fan of The Practice and was stunned by the force and power of McDermott's work here.  He carries himself with solidasarock strength and handles his quieter emotional moments with consummate restraint.  He also looks superbly the part eyes glowering beneath his black hat guns blazing away from the back of his horse.  Of course it also helps that Scott Busby and Martin Copeland's screenplay turns McNelly into a complex and fascinating character.  Haunted by the memory of his wife and child stolen by bandits while he was off in the wars dogged by a sickness that is bearing down on his soul always trusting the gun and the noose over the badge and the lawbook McNelly is a classic western hero bigger than life and still movingly human.  It's a terrific performance one of the best I've seen this year and it makes me wish that they'll keep making westerns just so McDermott can keep acting in them.Of course they won't keep making them if people won't get off their duffs and go see the good ones when they come along.  And trust me Texas Rangers is one of the good ones a topclass Bpicture with an Alist lead performance.  Give it a look if it's still at your local theatre.  I guarantee you won't be sorry you did.".

It's a terrific performance one of the best I've seen this year and it makes me wish that they'll keep making westerns just so McDermott can keep acting in them.Of course they won't keep making them if people won't get off their duffs and go see the good ones when they come along.  And trust me Texas Rangers is one of the good ones a topclass Bpicture with an Alist lead performance.  Give it a look if it's still at your local theatre.  I guarantee you won't be sorry you did.";

	schema:reviewBody "All the elements to makes this a great genre movie are present here especially in its formulaic but yet promising story premise. Then where did it go wrong? By the characters and cast for starters.The movie has an impressive cast and most do a more than fine job. It's ironic that however the actors I were most worried about Usher Raymond Ashton Kutcher did a great job playing their roles and the actors I was most confident about Dylan McDermott Tom Skerritt among others were miscast in the movie. But disappointing or not every character in the movie lacked some good development and background. The main character played by James Van Der Beek start off promising but as the movie progresses you more and more begin to wonder to yourself what makes the main character so special or even relevant for the story. Dylan McDermott is a good actor and he also for most part is good in his role but he just isn't convincing enough as an experienced tough dying gunslinger. It makes you wonder why Robert Patrick and McDermott didn't switched roles in this movie. It would had made the story at least a bit more believable. The main villain is being played by Alfred Molina. Perfect you would think. The character however seriously lacks some development and depth which makes him a pretty shallow and way too uninteresting main villain for the movie. And then there are the actors who are just simply underused in the movie such as Tom Skerritt. I mean does he even have lines in this movie? Cause I really can't remember any. So poor casting and character treatment all around for this movie.They tried very hard to make this movie a cool action movie also with a bombastic action score from Trevor Rabin. But however the movie is lacking in way too many action sequences to make this a good genre movie. They also desperately tried to make the action moments cool with quick shots and cuts that however really don't add up to each other and instead make the movie an incoherent one when it comes down to its action. The movie as a whole has poor editing all around. It almost seems as if this movie wasn't even shot entirely and the movie was not put together until in the editing room when it was too late to do some pick up shots.Despite it's promising premise nothing in the movie really works out the way it was supposed to. It really is too bad because in its core this movie really had potential. But perhaps they should had known better not to touch the Western genre that has been pretty death by now for the few past decades. This movie now is nothing more than a still somewhat watchable movie for on a rainy afternoon that perhaps should had gone straighttovideo immediately instead. Perhaps best watchable for the die hard genre fans only everyone else can better just skip this one.410httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

I remember hearing about this movie way back in 1999 when DAWSON'S CREEK which stars James Van Der Beek who plays Lincoln Rogers Dunnison in this movie was only in its second season. It came out in November of last year and although I didn't get to see it when it finally came to theaters but I did see it this weekend when I saw it on the new releases shelf at Blockbuster. It wasn't an awful movie though it's one that I think should have just gone straight to video in stead of having a theatrical release. Maybe in a few years if this movie starts being shown on cable or gets special DVD treatment more people will see it and it will have a small cult following. I wouldn't recommend it yet if you are a fan of shoot 'em up westerns you'll probably enjoy this.".

	schema:reviewBody "A lot of people have commentated that Texas RANGERS feels like a straight to video film but I disagree and wish to point out that it seems more like a pilot for a TV series . The script and the way the cast play their roles certainly suggests this since we've got characters that seem anachronistic and could very well have become litery devices for a long running TV series . An example is of having one of the rangers as a black character  think about it he's in a Southern state and he's black ! What an obvious character to use at a later stage to explore racism . Unfortunately because none of the characters will be appearing in their own series this leads to a serious problem that many people have picked up on and that is there's no character development . In fact this makes the entire film feel totally clichd and unconvincing There are other serious problems such as the way the film uses an overlayed map every time the rangers move from one location to another . This happens in nearly every single scene without fail and becomes totally patronising after the first 20 times . No seriously I'm not exaggerating  if someone treks more than a few yards we see a soft focus overlay of a map come up on screen without fail . Perhaps the fact that the film was obviously NOT shot in Texas might have everything to do with this ? Anyone who has a vague notion of where Texas might be will be stratching their head asking what the rangers are doing in Montana . I'm also pretty certain that the creation of the Texas rangers didn't happen as we're shown here TR is not a film that will satisfy everyone and I have a feeling that it will satisfy no one . Western aficionados will dislike because of its inaccurate feel while DAWSON CREEK viewers  Am I right in thinking that this is who it was marketed for ?  will very quickly become bored with the clichs".

	schema:reviewBody "From the opening shots through every scene acted out afterward NOTHING that is depicted in this movie EVER happened. It is a worse distortion than Tombstone. I don't know where to start. For openers the actor portraying McNelly admonishes a Ranger who is about to leave the service that he is riding a Ranger horse and saddle wearing Ranger clothes and carrying a Ranger gun and if he leaves he will be arrested for theft. Anyone who knows squat about the Rangers of that day knows they had to bring their own horse tack weapons and clothes and then they would be considered for the service. Using Ranger badges for target practice is absurd beyond words. At that time the Rangers HAD NO badges. Just a letter stating they were Rangers. The makers of this movie either did not know or care. All a Ranger had to do to quit is ride away with what he brought. Also John King Fisher was not a Mexican. He never shot down a crowd at a cattle auction. Leander McNelly's assignment in the Nueces Strip was to stop Mexican raiders from stealing cattle in Texas. His run in with John King Fisher was incidental and no shots were fired. McNelly and his men rode out to Fisher's ranch arrested him and turned him over to a local sheriff. Days later they met Fisher and some of his men on the trail. Turns out Fisher had a friend who was a local judge and the judge let him bond out. McNelly had no authority to override that and Fisher went free for a time. The Black man McNelly took into his band was a former slave named Ben Kinchlow. He was hired as a tracker at no payjust meals and equipment. When the shooting started between McNelly and the Mexican raiders Kinchlow held the horses. The Mexican General was an officer in the Ruales not the Mexican army and he had no connection with Fisher. He was killed in the first shoot out with McNelly's men. The pistols McNelly's men used were black powder five shot revolvers. The pistols used in the movie had not been invented at the time. The rifles they used were single shot black powder muzzle loaders. It wasn't until around three years after McNelly raided Mexico that the Rangers were given 1873 Winchesters. Over all the movie is an almost amusing western shoot'emup. The kind kids paid 15 cents to see back in the 1950s. It has nothing to do with the Texas Rangers. I don't know where the movie was filmed but I know the land from Corpus Christi to Brownsville to the Rio Grande and is is an ancient sea bed flat as a football field as far as you can see. This movie could have been titled Leo Gorcey and the Dead End Kids and the title would have been no more nonrelated than calling it Texas Rangers.".

Think of the hassle when he plays an usherand sleep at night? Ashton Kutcher still talks like he could fall of a water tower any minute and it doesn't help that Van Der Beek's last name here sounds a lot like Dawson but Usher proves to be a halfway decent actor he might be one of the only rapperssingersbusinessmen that actually took lessons and is believable in any way. Director Steve Miner gets everything filmed probably within time and budget but really doesn't have a lot of creative input this looked like a job for him the splatter from the two betterless awful Friday the 13thinstallments suits him better. The story is not that compelling but provides quite a lot of surprises even though they're not all that well written. The big problem really is that our main actor needs an extra dimension which he can't provide. We can't all be Clint Eastwood and we don't need a bad imitation of him but try to make what you feel seem genuinenot like you're still that guy from Dawson's Creek trying to get into bigger projects. The casting just ruins it a bit for me it could have been very good but it's not.".

Texas governor asking for help McNelly to form a company of Rangers to defeat the banditry along the Mexican frontier . Some cheerful greenhorns who volunteer to fight outlaws along the Rio Grande in 1875 Texas . As youngsters Jamen Van Der Berk  Usher Raymond  Jon Abrahams and Ashton Kutcher  band together and enlist the famous Texas Rangers commanded by the mysterious McNelly  McDermott. All are robbed of their families by the bad guys led by the really nasty Alfred Molina . The demanding mentor teaches them to shoot and kill at whatever mean .

It plays very much like a pilot for a TV series albeit with better production values. The plot seems uneven which may be the script but feels more like bad editing.

It is derivative but so is most drama even Shakespeare.The feel of the movie is fairly accurate to the time and place with just a couple of jarring moments. While I think Usher did a great job with his character there is no way that a reconstructionera Texas Ranger Company would have included a Negro  or that he would have called himself black. For the truly steeped in Western history the character of King Fisher was way off base. This is however the kind of flaw we've seen in Westerns that used the names of famous or infamous characters and little else about them.I liked the movie. If it was a pilot for a weekly series I would make time for it in my busy TVviewing schedule. Watching Dylan McDermott pass the reins of command to James Van Der Beek who showed his mettle as a leader was worth the time spent getting there. Most of the rest of the actors did a decent job with the plot they were given and the lines they had to speak. Robert Patrick and Randy Travis are journeymen and acted like it. The younger cast members did well but I have to admit I kept expecting Ashton Kutcher to ask where his horse was Dude. I would like to have seen more development of the character Rachael Leigh Cook played. Though she was more outspoken than most young women of the period there were some like her and it would have been interesting to see where that went.If ever a movie cried out for a director's cut DVD this is the one. I don't think Steve Miner set out to make a nearly 40 million dollar bomb. Someone hijacked this project and ran it off the tracks in my opinion. I'd like to see the movie all these people thought they were making.Would I recommend it? Yes with the reservations I outlined. Call it a 6 out of 10. And I will see it again. There are nits to be picked about the firearms used always a sore point with this reviewer who portrays a US Deputy Marshal in the 1880s on weekends and has seldom seen a movie without flaws in this area.".

Then finally why was this movie which is entertaining and decent killed off it doesn't deserve this treatment it's not a bad movie just one that feels like was killed off by a studio from the start. From what I've read John Mullis' script was baught my Miramax and they told him to change it. I've also heard other screen writter's names on this project as well although two lesser knowns are credited.

No not really but that wouldnt sound too unlikely if you see this horrible nightmare. I did ask the question listed above however. Where have you gone Clint Eastwood? The last good western i remember seeing was an Eastwood movie Unforgiven. So after witnessing this western i begged that question. We need Eastwood i don't care if he is 71 years old. All we need is one more good western just one and there will be hope left for the genre.But I know this will never happen. Because after viewing this...thing and recalling American Outlaws i have discovered the truth. It is simply this Hollywood is attempting to kill the western. Don't deny it. Think about it. Just think about the cast of this movie. First there's James Vanderbeek who's last name im sure i spelled wrong. Does ANYONE out there buy Dawson as a Texas Ranger? I mean shouldn't this guy move off the creek before he tries to be a tough guy?Next theres Ashton Kutcher Dude Where's My Car? Enough said.Then theres Usher USHER?!?!? How the hell did that happen? Seriously are you tellin me that just after the Civil War a confederate state is going to make a black guy a lawman? So add to the worst casting in the history of American cinema quite possibly the worst script Hollywood has puked up in the last fifty years and you have THE WORST WESTERN EVER.

Not that the list means anything it didn't include DUMB  DUMBER the funniest damn movie ever made but I agreed with this choice.Bud Cort is Harold a morbid teenage boy neglected by his rich mother Vivian Pickles who spends her time trying to match him up with blind dates. Harold delights in pretending to kill himself to get attention from his mother and pulls some gruesome tricks out of his sleeve to scare away his blind dates. He goes to funerals as a hobby and while there he meets Maude Ruth Gordon a carefree elderly woman. Maude helps to teach Harold the beauty of life and the two slowly fall in love.HAROLD AND MAUDE was ever nominated for any Oscars but it should have been. Bud Cort and Ruth Gordon are both brilliant in their roles unfortunately this would be the last good film either of them made. Cort was recently reduced to a bit part in THEODORE REX and Gordon died in 1985. But both here are at shining moments in their careers. Vivian Pickles is right ontarget as Harold's rich prissy mother who tries to run Harold's life for him until he breaks free. Maude is certainly one of the most heartwarming characters in cinema history her philosophies are so very true that I couldn't help but apply them to my life after the movie was over. Some viewers may be disgusted at the thought of a teenage boy and an elderly woman being a hot item but the idea and execution of it is more an act of respect and love for one another as people than an act of lust and romance making this in my opinion the most romantic film of all time. HAROLD AND MAUDE is also told very realistically making the story unfold gracefully and the twist ending is both poignant and reassuring.HAROLD AND MAUDE is certainly one of the funniest movies of all time but is also one of the most important human stories as well.".

Bud Cort and Ruth Gordon are both brilliant in their roles unfortunately this would be the last good film either of them made. Cort was recently reduced to a bit part in THEODORE REX and Gordon died in 1985. But both here are at shining moments in their careers. Vivian Pickles is right ontarget as Harold's rich prissy mother who tries to run Harold's life for him until he breaks free. Maude is certainly one of the most heartwarming characters in cinema history her philosophies are so very true that I couldn't help but apply them to my life after the movie was over. Some viewers may be disgusted at the thought of a teenage boy and an elderly woman being a hot item but the idea and execution of it is more an act of respect and love for one another as people than an act of lust and romance making this in my opinion the most romantic film of all time. HAROLD AND MAUDE is also told very realistically making the story unfold gracefully and the twist ending is both poignant and reassuring.HAROLD AND MAUDE is certainly one of the funniest movies of all time but is also one of the most important human stories as well.";

When Harold meets the anarchist seventy nine yearold Maude Ruth Gordon at a funeral they become friends and the old lady discloses others perspectives of the cycle of life for him.

On the day of the eightieth anniversary of Maude Harold proposes her but he finds the truth about the end of the cycle of life.The cult Harold and Maude was a huge success in Brazil for people of my generation with a refreshing and funny exposition of themes like death love and life through the friendship and love of a teenager and a septuagenarian woman. The complex Harold is a young man that needs the attention of his indifferent mother. He found in his childhood the only moment that she really seemed to be worried about him after a serious accident in school and he uses to fake suicides trying to have the same attention back. Maude is an anarchist old woman not attached to material stuff like properties or collections that steals cars for selflocomotion. Along a few days Maude gives a lesson of life to Harold changing his behavior and feelings forever. The performances of Ruth Gordon and Bud Cort in this weird love story are unforgettable and the soundtrack with Cat Steven's songs is another plus. Unfortunately Harold and Maude has been forgotten in Brazil by the distributors and neither the VHS nor the DVD has been released in my country I just have a tape recorded from the cable TV. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Ensiname a Viver Teach me to Live".

	schema:reviewBody "When Cameron Diaz's character in the Farrelly brothers' 1998 comedy There's Something About Mary describes Harold And Maude as the 'greatest love story of our time' she's not far wrong. While it may not be a conventional love story by any means it is engaging passionate and oddly believable. It was a very brave step to take to make a film about a young boy who falls in love with an old woman and to tell it in such a dreamlike manner. In a society that generally accept older men falling for younger women to reverse that trend was extremely daring especially back in 1971.Harold Bud Cort is a 20something who feels isolated and disconnected with his life living with his rich mother who seems to only be concerned with finding her strange son a wife. Obsessed with death he regularly stages fake suicides in front of his unresponsive and unimpressed mother. He seems doomed to life of morbidity until he meets 80year old Maude Ruth Gordon who seems to share his passion of attending funerals. Maude has a completely different outlook on life and indulges in her passions for art and culture and 'making the most of her time on Earth'. The two become equally infatuated with each other as Maude shows Harold the delights of life and begins to teach him how to play the banjo. As Harold falls deeply in love with Maude his mother persists with quest to find Harold a wife and after one fake suicide too many she decides to send him into the military.This is the kind of nihilistic and existential that could have only be produced in the 70's amidst the madness and folly of the Vietnam war. Harold is a child of this generation and seems to embody the anger loss and early loss of innocence that the children of this generation felt. Harold is born into a life lacking in meaning and direction while Maude has lived a life full of purpose and having been a prisoner in Auschwitz in a moving blinkoryou'llmissit revelation has endured the hardships and extremities of life. Harold with his persistent fake suicides seems to long for this.All this sounds extremely heavy but the film explores these themes with a feisty sense of humour and an air of quirkiness found commonly these days in the films of Wes Anderson. The black comedy seems way ahead of its time. In one scene Harold finds another potential wife at his home chatting to his mother. He greets the young lady with a very mature and pleasant manner only to excuse himself and walk outside carrying a jug of petrol. As his mother and the young lady exchange pleasantries Harold can be scene in the background through the window dousing himself in petrol and then seemingly set himself on wife. The young girl screams in horror as Harold's mother sits embarrassed only for Harold to appear next to her as if nothing happened.The relationship between Harold and Maude would probably be uncomfortable and strange in another director's hands but with a fantastic script by Colin Higgins and a heartfelt soundtrack by Cat Stevens the whole things is moving profound and sweet. The film conjured up so many emotions in me as the credits rolled after the poignant final scene. Harold And Maude is in equal measures touching intelligent insightful beautiful and extremely vicious.www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com".

Her unique outlook and interesting activities which include grand theft auto endear her to Harold and the two kindred spirits form a close relationship which eventually blossoms into romance.This may seem quite unbelievable and frankly disgusting for a twentysomething to fall for an eightyyearold but through Ashby's beautiful skilled direction and Bud Cort's and Ruth Gordon's wonderful performances the love story is entirely convincing and quite beautifully handled.The humor is as I said to begin with very black but there are plenty of laughoutloud moments particularly with Harold's methods of scaring of dates picked for him by his mother and the reaction of Harold's family and friends to the news of his infatuation with Maude.

As well as the incredible synergy between Ruth Gordon and Bud Cort the amusing waspish English accented mother played by Vivian Pickles is a star performance. The other 'star' of the film are the hearses Harold's first one and then his conversion of a present from his mother of the world's first Jaguar hearse. Of course this was to inspire the hearse that was so focal to Six Feet Under many years later. You HAVE to see Harold  Maude.";

	schema:reviewBody "Bud Cort appeared in two of my favorite and two of the quirkiest movies from the 1970s Harold and Maude and Brewster McCloud. He also appeared in a cameo at the tailend of Sweet Charity another of my favorites. Given that little resume of movie roles he has forever won a place in my heart as has this movie.Harold and Maude is a modest little masterpiece from Hal Ashby and deserves to be viewed as more than just an eccentric little cult hit appreciated by an elite few. It's hard to think of another movie whose success relies so entirely upon its pitchperfect tone. Ashby's film walks a tightrope between black almost too black comedy and sentimental almost too sentimental pathos but manages to blend the two perfectly to produce something quite unlike anything else I've ever seen.Harold is a gloomy misfit with a morbid death obsession who likes to stage his own fake suicides in order to win the attention of his dithery and oblivious mother Vivian Pickles in an uproarious performance. He meets Maude Ruth Gordon an eccentric old lady with a taste for fast driving and an unparalleled lust for life. Maude teaches Harold how to enjoy the world around him instead of letting it slowly pass him by while Harold gives Maude someone to share her days with. It's an achingly beautiful movie in a lowkey kind of way. Ashby is the king of understatement and everything both the outrageous comedy and the tender sad moments are delivered simply and effectively. He's got great actors in a great story and he trusts both enough to stand back and let them work their magic.Ruth Gordon gives one of my favorite film performances of all time as Maude. It would be easy to dismiss her role as easy if it were not for those quiet moments when Maude lets her enthusiastic guard down and we get glimpses of some sadness in her life that she's made a willful decision not to let overcome her. There are moments in this movie that actually made me think differently about the world we live in. Just for an example there's a scene when Harold and Maude are sitting by a pond and Harold gives Maude a ring he won for her in a carnival. She clutches it to her chest thanks him for it and then throws it into the water. Harold at first looks outraged that she would throw his gift away. But she says Now I'll always know where it is and Harold's hurt look transforms into a smile of understanding. If I could think about life the way the character of Maude does in this movie I know I would be a happier person.Harold and Maude is a shining gem from the 1970s and one of those movies I just have to watch every once in a while. Along with the two leads there's of course Pickles' offthewall performance and very funny support from actors in minor roles like Harold's therapist sagging buttocks and his warcrazed uncle. Plus there's the wonderful score comprised of Cat Stevens songs which caps off the tone of the movie beautifully.Grade A".

But as with all cult movies the very quirkiness that makes them special repulses others. Even the Cat Stevens soundtrack with many famous and notsofamous songs throughout will thrill some and make other run. It's a crude movie in some ways including the way the songs get truncated so often but it's brilliant in too many other ways to care. Watch for searing perfect performances by Ruth Gordon and Bud Cort as the titled characters and also by Vivian Pickles as the mother. Cinematographer John Alonzo is a mainstay in the industry and helps hold together the entire feel of the movie. And really the story itself by Colin Higgins is a spot on fairy tale.".

Harold is a rich kid who is obsessed with death and likes to stage very believable and hilarious succession of suicide attempts to impress his unflappable socialite mother who got used to them and not impressed anymore. Harold's others hobbies are driving the hearse and to attend funerals where he meets one day a woman who will change his life forever 79 years young freespirit rebel and fighter for Liberty. Rights. Justice Maude. She also likes to attend the funerals of the strangers. We won't learn much about Maude's life story but there will be one visual flash which gives us a very good idea that Maude knew a lot about death losses and suffering but she chose to celebrate worship and enjoy life to the fullest. This short poignant moment is a stroke of genius and there are many of them in the truly unique one of its kind movie. Maybe Hal Ashby had brought some of memories from his own childhood that included the divorce of his parents his father's suicide his dropping out of high school getting married and divorced all before he was 19 into Harold and Maude. Hal Ashby had made a series of memorable intelligent well acted films in the 70s that included The Last Detail 1973 Shampoo 1975 Bound for Glory 1976 Coming Home 1978 and Being There 1979 but it is Harold and Maude that has become the cult classic from the first days of its release and it more than deserves its status.

But those films don't really count because they are essentially only male wishful thinking fantasies where these relationships are presented as completely natural and common place as far as I can see though in the real world old guys don't bag off with gorgeous thirty year old women on a regular basis. No to be more precise cinematic intergenerational romances remain conspicuous by their absence if the sexes are swapped the other way around.In this film a young man with a deathfixation called Harold meets Maude a 79 year old woman with a lust for life. She lives by her rules alone and she teaches Harold how to grasp life by the scruff of the neck. They fall in love. But one of the many wonderful things about this film is that this scenario is actually presented rather believably and the romance itself is never played for laughs and is treated with respect. Bud Cort with his sickly pallor and bizarre eccentricities such as driving a hearse and attending funerals recreationally is believable as a lost young man while Ruth Gordon makes for a genuinely alluring 79 year old. The great chemistry between the leads is what underpins the success of the movie as a whole. Despite all this it bombed at the box office. Clearly the basic idea must've seemed too offputting for general audiences to get behind even if it's theme of youthful disillusionment and its antiestablishment message was certainly in tune with the times. But over the years it picked up a cult audience eventually making money by the mid 80's evidentially once people actually saw the movie they understood.At its heart though it's a comedy and a genuinely funny one at that. Unlike a lot of comedies from bygone years its humour remains potent. Maybe it was ahead of its time in some ways and a lot of folks weren't prepared for its peculiar black comedy? Whatever the case there are many funny moments such as Harold staging elaborate faux suicide performances for the benefit of his uncaring mother and his succession of disastrous blind dates. Then there is Maude's criminal behaviour and couldn'tcareless attitude which leads to a hilarious scene with a hapless traffic cop  played by Tom Skerritt under the name M. Borman  which ranks as maybe the funniest moment in the whole film. But another reason to cherish this film is that it mixes the madcap humour with understated seriousness for instance at one point Harold notices a Holocaust concentration camp serial number tattooed on Maude's forearm. It's never referred to again but it doesn't need to be this moment tells so much about what made Maude who she is.Director Hal Ashby really turned out a true oneoff with Harold and Maude. Ashby was one of the leading directors of the New Hollywood era and this may well rank as his best achievement. In some ways it makes for an interesting counterpart to the earlier film The Graduate which also shares a similar relationship dynamic at its core  although admittedly far less extreme agewise. Both male characters are rich disillusioned boys whose lives are controlled by their parents' generation. But while the affair in The Graduate is emotionally empty in Harold and Maude it is the exact opposite. And as great a film as Mike Hodges one is it doesn't have the same level of originality in its characters that Hal Ashby's one does. Both films too have wonderful folk rock soundtracks and while Simon  Garfunkel edges it Cat Stevens soundtrack for Harold and Maude is still a beautiful and perfect accompaniment to this great film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Life and Death are explored in cinema frequently and films have been created juxtaposing the two themes years before this came out but none has had the ability to make the heavy themes be condensed in a neat little story tied by love. I didn't love it the first time I watched it because I felt it lacked a little texture and Harold's attempts seemed more shocking rather than funny. But oh how much a second viewing can change one's point of view.Colin Higgins wrote the screenplay for this film. Higgins hasn't got a lot of films in his resume but he has written 3 feature films that are decent. Harold and Maude's screenplay does lack an aim and that is one reason why I couldn't really grasp it the first time but coming back to this I started to understand what Higgins was trying to exhibit. The themes life and death could not be more plainly obvious than it does in this film but the film avoids from being too campy by creating humor and putting these characters in unconventional environments and situations. Harold is a complex character to truly understand him one must not wait for answers and insight to be given but instead look for it and empathise on his current state. Maude is the complete opposite of Harold and that's the reason that she took an interest in him as if she knew that he was an empty void needing something to cling onto. His 'attempts' may be a bit dark for some people which was true in my first viewing but it does come off as hilarious the second time knowing just how far it goes. Harold and his mother is a relationship that always had me thinking and as more of Harold's layers climb to the surface the more we understand the decisions of his actions.This is Hal Ashby's second film and he has definitely did a great job here. Ashby seems to be much more concerned with investigating the themes of the film rather than making the story shine. This prevents the film from feeling campy and predictable which is probably the reason why people keep coming back to this. Ashby has been known to make more films within the lighter side of the spectrum in terms of it's tone and this film keeps that but due to it's dark subject matter it creates an atmosphere that can be seen as darkly hilarious or twistedly sick also something that is much more risky and unique. The film doesn't move very fast because the film indulges on it's comedic moments which I like as some directors get too selfconscious and avoids this approach to gain more respect from the casual viewer. The film doesn't feel big and it does seem like it was restricted by it's budget which turned out as a positive as it gave the film that indie and simple style that it needed in order to keep the film grounded.John Alonzo is the film's cinematographer for Harold and Maude. Alonzo definitely understands the film's themes as his photography supports it so well. He ensures that the house that Harold lives in feels empty and melancholy. Harold within this household is always hit with dark shadows and colors never seem to pop except for the color red. In Maude's home it does feel much more upbeat and fun with the background of the shots being subtly filled up with little things from Maude's past. As the film moves back and forth between Harold's life at home and his life with Maude the photography becomes more of a metaphor of Harold's emotional state when within these domains. The film never looks pretty and it also doesn't have the benefit of having ambitious locations to shoot in but Ashby and Alonzo does make the most out of it. This film is only the third feature film that Alonzo has worked on with many of his previous work being in televisions and documentaries ergo his lack of experience held the film back from being too pretentious or clever.Harold and Maude is a soundtrack driven film and what a soundtrack list this film has. The songs that come arrive at the perfect moment and they all sound so pessimistically fun kind of like a balance between the two personalities of the characters. When the songs come on it had me tapping my feet and tilting my head from side to side along with the beat. I don't think this film feels like it needed a score because that would undercut the humor that this film has to offer.Bud Cort was superb as Harold as he was able to play a character who was emotionally and psychologically tortured but also deliver the comedic timing that Ashby wanted from him. Ruth Gordon is a seasoned actress who has worked on many classics like Rosemary's Baby and Edge of Darkness and this film belongs with the stature that these classics are currently on. When the film focuses on the titular characters Maude is the one that is always rambling and Gordon was able to achieve that without having the audience feeling annoyed of her. Vivian Pickles plays as Harold's mother and her character is similar to Maude due to the fact that she rambles on in every scene she is in but she was able to come off as annoying as intended by the director.Harold and Maude isn't for everyone but the protagonists are so different from each other that you can't help but be intrigued on how it plays out. Also Harold's hilarious suicide attempts gives the film that dark edge that it needed in making this film fun to watch over and over.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rich but gloomy disaffected and neurotic Harold a lovely and charming portrayal by Bud Cort has a morbid fixation on death he regularly attends funerals of complete strangers and stages elaborate phony suicides in an attempt to get noticed by his cold and overbearing mother superbly played to snooty perfection by Vivian Pickles. Harold gets shaken out of his grim funk after he meets and befriends Maude a marvelously spry and rascally performance by Ruth Gordon an exuberant elderly free spirit who gets Harold to loosen up and start enjoying life. Director Hal Ashby working from a fresh quirky and witty script by Colin Higgins does a terrific job of creating and sustaining a delightfully droll and deadpan tone that gives the giddy black humor an irresistible blend of joy and verve that's a total treat to watch Harold's fake suicides in particular are positively sidesplitting. Moreover the sweet and touching central love story between two endearing oddball misfits is handled with great taste and sensitivity. Better still this movie makes a profound statement about how one person can have a significant positive impact on another human being and how we should all love and appreciate life while we can. Among the comic highlights are Maude's wildly careening driving of stolen vehicles Harold's inappropriate computer dates Ellen Geer as pretentious aspiring actress Sunshine Dore is a complete hoot as she beats Harold at his own game and Maude stealing a motorcycle from a highway patrolman Tom Skerritt in a nifty minor role. In addition we even get some real pathos amongst all the madcap hilarity it's implied that Maude was a concentration camp survivor and Harold's big breakup scene is truly moving. It's this delicate blend of humor and poignancy which makes this film so special and unique. Cort and Gordon are both outstanding in the leads they receive sterling support from Pickles Charles Tyner as Harold's gungho military fanatic Uncle Victor and Eric Christmas as a disapproving priest. Cat Stevens provides a sublimely cheerful and uplifting score. John A. Alonzo's bright cinematography gives the picture a pleasing sunny look. Essential viewing.".

	schema:reviewBody "An amusing curio of a film Harold and Maude is about manwoman relations that I can actually not only stomach but get emotionally satisfied with as well. The man and woman aforementioned may be a teenage boy and a 79 year old woman but that is only surface detail that may work to draw one into the deep meaning of the connection between the two. And that connection expunges the surface detail of that long transit of age between them. The sexual revolution not only gave more leeway for the young to experiment sexually. Director Hal Ashby reminds us here that that revolution need not be just for the young and that there should be a more holistic meaning of freedom. In the context of this movie a freedom not limited to age. Set during the uncertain latter days of the rights revolutions in the early seventies Maude is an original player in the social protests from the early 20th century Progressive era. To her the Sixties hoopla is but old news or rather universal and transcending ideas attitudes and feelings that transmorph into new threads from olde wares. She has already participated in her collective revolution and now she takes care of the personal. Harold is a teenage boy who finds both a dark amusement and psychologically necessary outlet in pretending to kill himself . His morbidity and her lust for life brings them together at a funeral they're both attending just for the hellor the life cycle of it one does it due to a dark obsession with death and the other to participate in the sacred and infinite life and death cycles of nature. This mutual coming together over death provides the launching pad of their intimate and unusual relationship. The movie's uplifting call for life to be lived instead of to be moped and grieved is expressed genuinely and genuinely felt by the creators and more perceptive viewers respectively. It wins for its celebration of true love and what it really means to truly love. The transcendent qualities of love are of paramount importance here it doesn't bother Harold that the woman he loves is so sundered from him in experience and age and it doesn't bother Maude that a young man with some serious mental issues because want keeps them enamoured of each other extinguishes those other distances. Their quirky but perfectly natural bond is stuff that make one breath a little bit easier with the reassuring idea that there is something someone for everyone no matter how old or weird and alienated one is. I hate describing such a nuanced film with such tired clichs please don't let those deter you from thinking it's any good. This film is anything but a clich if fact it is one of the most unique love stories before of since. I could go on and write about the subtle and naturalistic acting like for instance the facial gestures that are crucial but often overlooked by more recent viewers the speechless moments where communication is expressed flawlessly without speech but I'll just leave it at that. My subjective measure of this film definitely has to be a 10.".

An eccentric mother tries to fix Harold up with dates through a dating service while Harold sabotages her efforts. Harold learns how to live through his relationship with Maude. An interesting ending. Music of Cat Stevens. Harold and Maude is one of my most favorite movies of all time. The relationship between Harold and Maude is one of mutual respect and unconditional love rather than lust and sex. The performances of Bud Cort and Ruth Gordon were very convincing. Both individuals were perfect for the roles they played.".

	onyx:emotionText "An introverted young man Harold played by Bud Cort has a morbid fascination with death meets 79 year old Maude played by Ruth Gordon with same interests. Both Harold and Maude attend funerals of people they don't know. This is where they first meet. An eccentric mother tries to fix Harold up with dates through a dating service while Harold sabotages her efforts. Harold learns how to live through his relationship with Maude. An interesting ending. Music of Cat Stevens. Harold and Maude is one of my most favorite movies of all time. The relationship between Harold and Maude is one of mutual respect and unconditional love rather than lust and sex. The performances of Bud Cort and Ruth Gordon were very convincing. Both individuals were perfect for the roles they played.";

As a sentence she has to be police chief for a day according to the person introducing the film at the Japan Society in New York where this film premiered this actually happens. Her assistant is a former lover who is a serial killer. He once tried to kill her but she as well as the police are looking the other way about that. Also in the mix is Sakura Ando as Momo. In the span of one week I've seen her in three films Love Exposure Ain't No Tomorrows and this one. She is remarkably versatile and should have a great career ahead of her like the equally talented Ms. Narumi. Anyway throw in a salaryman who witnesses a murder done by the serial killer and then gets hit by a truck as well as a trio of hapless robbers with a taser gun and you have a comedy which is all over the place. Stay with it though. If you don't like black comedy I think you should skip it but otherwise it is recommended. Don't take it seriously and you'll be fine.".

A priest becoming sexual isn't that far fetched in this day and age but really when your movie makes it look like a priest is hitting on a woman in his marriage counseling class in front of her soon to be husband just rubs me the wrong way.License to Wed is neither terrible nor wonderful.

	schema:headline " Beware Reverend Frank...and this movie";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm going to say something that no one in License to Wed has the guts or the brains to say  Reverend Frank belongs behind bars. Frank is supposed to be a goofy and likable guy who grows on us despite his unorthodox methods toward couples coaching. Unfortunately the movie goes to such extremes that we are not so much charmed by Frank rather we are terrified by him. The man is a menace and the fact that nobody seems to realize it except for one character makes everyone in this movie come across as completely oblivious.Young lovers Ben Murphy John Krasinski and Sadie Jones Mandy Moore have just made plans to take their relationship to the next level and get married. It's always been Sadie's dream to be married at the family church with Reverend Frank Robin Williams doing the ceremony. Before they can get married however Frank forces the young lovers into a bizarre program where they will have to pass a series of tests to see if they are right for each other. Frank along with his young student Josh Flitter sets up a series of challenges and simulations that are supposed to represent the difficulties that the couple will face in the future together. While it sounds reasonable enough in theory the Reverend goes so far as to invading their private lives even bugging Ben and Sadie's apartment with concealed recording equipment letting him hear everything that happens when he's not around. Ben's patience with Frank's extreme program starts to wear thin and the young couple start to contemplate if things are as compatible between them as they initially thought.There's nothing really wrong with License to Wed whenever Reverend Frank is not on the screen. During those times it's a perfectly ordinary romantic comedy that plays by the rules. Unfortunately Frank is a major character and the movie devotes too much time to him. He's an evil manipulative man and we're supposed to laugh at him because he's played by Robin Williams and he's constantly shooting off zippy oneliners. If this character had been played straight I have no doubt believing his Reverend Frank would be right up there with his deranged performances in Insomnia and One Hour Photo. At one point he has a 10yearold kid break into the couple's apartment while they're away at a session and conceal a wire tap in their home. The character of Frank comes across as someone who enjoys tormenting young couples who just want to get married and is not below employing children to do his dirty work so that he remains off the hook. If this sounds like a jovial comical character to you I highly suggest counseling.My question is why does nobody else in this movie but Ben realize just how evil this guy is? And when Ben discovers the wire tap why doesn't he make a bigger deal about it? More importantly why doesn't Sadie? When Ben finally does tell her about the hidden recording equipment Sadie doesn't even react to this revelation nor does she even act offended. Are we to believe this woman doesn't even care that this man has been violating their privacy? If I seem to be putting too much stock in one character I can't help it. He is what makes this entire movie go wrong. The character hangs over the movie like a black shadow and causes everyone to become incredibly stupid because no one can admit to themselves that this man is wrong. Even Ben who distrusts him from the moment he lays eyes on Frank winds up liking the guy before the movie's over.It's hard to get behind a cast when they're forced to play clueless morons for the sake of the plot. Mandy Moore once again finds herself playing a woman who refuses to even look at the obvious until the screenplay feels its convenient for her to do so. After Because I Said So and now this I'm starting to wonder if she has some kind of bizarre fascination with women who make bad decisions for no reason other than to move the plot along. John Krasinski is passable but not much more than that. He seems to kind of be playing a Ben Stillertype character only without Stiller's enthusiasm. The rest of the cast spend most of the time in the background not contributing much of anything. That's because Reverend Frank keeps on hijacking the movie at every conceivable opportunity. It gets to the point we start wondering if we're watching a movie or if we're watching one of Williams' lesser improv performances.License to Wed is a movie that goes so extremely off course and it's all because of one man. If he had just been written a different way the film could have been salvaged. As it is he drags the entire movie down with him. It's amazing how the wrong lead character can affect everyone and everything around them. When the movie came to its predetermined happy ending I didn't feel joy. I felt sorry for this couple that this guy was still a part of their lives and imagined what hell awaited them in the future. I'm sure we'll hear all about it if we're unfortunate enough to get a sequel.".

That wellrounded audience spent an hour and a half with Robin Williams god of comedy with not a single good laugh.

The plot so to speak consisted of Robin Williams as a minister conspiring to make the future marriage of Mandy Moore and the other one strong by torturing them at every turn and doing such charming things as bugging their apartment to ensure they were not having forbidden premarital sex.

Correct me if I wrong. But I think the official term for that is contributing to the delinquency of a minor. And cops can arrest one for that! So even if this review gets voted as zerooutofahundred found it useful I'm still urging my fellow moviegoers to boycott this movie and spend their money on a fullfledged vacation.

Robin Williams broke his curse of failing comedies with this movie I genuinely laughed whenever his character made a joke And trust me it takes a lot to make me laugh so hard that i might cry.

Flory who could not even get the point of the hints. I was like d'oh... and omg how can anyone make it more obvious?.The robot babies are so funny! The part where he has a sudden onset of super watery nose and super drool or whatever. Another part was where the mother watched Ben Murphy John Krasinski drop one baby hangs the other one and then the baby leaks out blue toothpaste.... The next part is even more insane where he freaks out and starts smashing the baby's head in front of everyone.And also the part where Reverend Frank Robin Williams takes the headphones off Choir Boy for adult sexual sounds. Sadie reacted so hint when Ben makes his move with his hand. The baseball throwing scene was also very awesome seriously the lines were so funny.I will feel the same way as how Sadie Jones Mandy Moore would look like in the face in the final church gathering all the anger scrunched up inside like a teapot ready to pout like an eruption after the water is boiled.I laughed so hard when Ben wrote nothing but drew an animated truck driving toward and through the fire hoop like in a circus and the fire hoop dies down. Also the entire driving scene was ultimately the worst case scenario. It tells everyone never to suddenly call out something it will either distract the driver or the driver will totally neglect it and an accident will occur. Obviously Sadie was blindfolded and he goes LOOK OUT!. Also I thought she should have her blindfold soaked in sweat and tears of shock.There is this one part that totally reminded me of the famous Home Alone television quoting scene where he uses the lines of a movie to scare off anyone who is at the front door. The part is where Reverend Frank was singing in the shower and he suddenly sang STOP. as if he knew that someone had broken into his house.However I was so touched when Ben actually inscribed his vows on the beach to Sadie.Talking about inscriptions at the purchase of the wedding ring he wrote down Never to Part for 'engraving the wedding band' but it came out an F instead of a P one reason for that was sort of shown to us because of his erasing marks he could erase completely and properly so I think he did not realize that others will have just smartly figured out that the smudged area has been linked to make the letter a P.On the other hand I thought Reverend Frank was a total psychologist and not a reverend. It was at the gathering table where he asked Ben to describe in one word for each future inlaw. Ben fell for it totally he starts to spurt out the truth in his heart. I felt that that was kind of mean. But hey I thought that it gave me a hint about the Reverend's possible secrets.I also like the crude stuff from Joel DeRay Davis fishing for girls and definitely talking Ben into ...watching the Reverend take a shower.I recommend this movie for ages above 13 because there are segments of adult implications. Encore for the robot babies and encore tricks by Reverend Frank played by Robin Williams!".

Kay Francis is the wife of Secretary of State Preston Foster and she'd like to see her husband as President. Her family has been in the White House before her grandfather was president at one time. It's what's given her the status of Washington hostess and behind the scenes maker of policy and men.Kaufman was very clever indeed in choosing Kay's character name of Kate Chase Wayne. Back in the 19th century one Kate Chase Sprague was the daughter of Salmon P. Chase Governor and Senator from Ohio and Lincoln's Secretary of the Treasury. Chase was a widower and his daughter before and after she married William Sprague a Senator from Rhode Island was a popular Washington hostess and behind the scenes back room player. She strove mightily to make her father president he had to settle for being Chief Justice however to cap his career off.This 20th century Kate Chase has an ongoing rivalry with another Washington hostess in Verree Teasdale. Teasdale is the trophy wife of a pompous old water buffalo of a Supreme Court Justice in Walter Connolly but a promising young Senator in Victor Jory has caught her eye as well as the eye of Anita Louise Francis's niece. Teasdale's thinking that she'd like to be First Lady even unofficially and she's pushing Keith.Francis gets right back and starts a rumor that Connolly just might make a good presidential candidate and she's hoisted on her own petard for that one. The boom for the pompous old galoot actually takes off. Kay's got to do some scrambling for that one.Of course she saves the day but it's through the use of another old 19th century scandal that did almost sink a presidential candidacy and is more successful here. You have to see First Lady to find out what Kay did.Francis and Teasdale are a good set of foes the like of which weren't seen until Joan Collins and Linda Evans came on prime time TV in Dynasty. My favorite though is Connolly a guy no one thought of as president until he gets the bug. In fact this seems to be the germ of the idea for the famous George S. Kaufman film The Senator Was Indiscreet with William Powell playing exactly the kind of character Connolly plays in the next decade.

When she realizes her nemesis Irene Verree Tisdale is dumping her fuddyduddy Supreme Court justice husband Connelly and taking up with the dashing Senator Keane Victor Jory and will probably be pushing him to run Lucy gets to work convincing the powerful head of a women's organization Louise Fazenda that Irene's current husband is great presidential timbre thus forcing Irene to stay by her husband's side. Hubby is the world's dullest man about as presidential as a piece of wood and spends his evening listening to a family radio show.This is obviously a play and as talky as all getout plus it's very dated based on the premise that while politics is a man's world the men are merely puppets for the women behind them. Kay Francis looks great and is very charming but for me her comedy is a little bit pushed. As far as I'm concerned Verree Tisdale as Irene walks away with the movie as the bored bitchy Irene. Her scene with Connelly where she complains about their evenings at home is a riot. Connelly is great as the plodding Supreme Court Justice.Kaufman wrote some wonderful dialogue so the script is witty if low on action. Watch it for the performances.".

I guess that's okay as there are movies for all tastes and I just didn't happen to like this one very much.Kay Francis plays the lead as a very manipulative woman who is married to the Secretary of State. She and all the women seem to think their very successful husbands are actually idiots who can be easily manipulated by them into greater and greater political success. In other words the women are all conniving and the men generally are quite dim.While all this apparently went over very well in the 1930s on stage I wonder how many other people might dislike the film because of its rather old fashioned and sexist ideas. My concern was actually less because of sexism but more because it all seemed so incredibly contrived and fakeand almost like the relationship between the women and men from The Flintstones! Plus none of the characters seemed particularly nice or likable. Instead of the conniving I would love to have seen a more gentle film where a wife DOES help her husband become a success because they are a teamless because she's the reincarnation of Macchiavelli! Overall this film does not seem to have aged well. I think had the men and women not been such obvious stereotypes OR if they had made the characters a bit more evil and manipulative it would have been a better film though in the latter case it certainly wouldn't have been a comedy.".

There is little to no gore instead the focus on on building tension leading into the frantic and frenzied climax.

I haven't seen the movie since I was a kid but at that age I went to see a movie more than once so I still recall the movie pretty well. Silent Scream was one of the first psycho killer on a rampage' kinds of horror movies I had ever seen. Most of my childhood movie experiences were supernatural gore fests.  I had gone through life blissfully believing that all things horrific where relegated to the realm of the supernatural where they couldn't hurt me. That ended for me in the summer of 1980 the year Silent Scream and Friday the 13th came out. I was glued to my seat eyes like saucers watching some wackedout person hacking people up with a butcher knife or trying to pull them through a hole in the attic wall so they could hack them up. It was pure magic for an adolescent boy. It didn't matter that there was no mystery to figure out. All that mattered was that I was getting the youknowwhat scared out of me and loving it. I look back now and think of how truly silly those kinds of movies were but hey they were great summer entertainment for a junior high school kid. I still have a soft place in my heart for all of those mindless slasher movies. I would recommend Silent Scream for anyone who loves classic 80's horror the best decade for horror in my opinion. Here are some other recommendations for horrorthriller from my childhood I'll try to stick to the less well known ones Humanoids from the Deep The Boogens The Boogeyman Sleepaway Camp Dead of WinterEvil Speak Scanners well known but a must Mausoleum Motel Hell Blood Beach Happy Birthday to Me April Fools Day Sole Survivor Galaxy of Terror. There is also from the seventies  Suspiria Alice Sweet Alice The Other Burnt Offerings Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things Piranha and Giant Spider Invasion most of which I saw in the eighties. There are a lot more that don't come to mind right away but suffice to say that I made it my goal to see all the horror movies I could when I was young and there were a ton of them. I'm sure I loved them all. Please feel free to contact me for any recommendations to give or receive.".

Bennett that has some memorable twists. It's graphically bloody at times but also has fine atmosphere and a healthy nod to Psycho in its use of an imposing beach side house.College student Scotty Rebecca Balding is in desperate need of a place to live and ends up at this house owned by a weird family the Engels. Unfortunately Scotty and her fellow roommates won't know just how creepy this family is until it's almost too late. When one of the kids is murdered a subplot develops with two detectives Cameron Mitchell Avery Schreiber investigating the case.The cute Balding is an appealing lead in this story given effective theatrical treatment by commercial veteran Denny Harris in his only feature credit. Helping a great deal is a grandiose music score by the underrated Roger Kellaway who also composes a period style song for the show. There is some good suspense and many ominous shots of the house and its interiors. The shocks are well realized as well.Yvonne De Carlo is also among the familiar faces appearing. Mitchell and an effectively serious Schreiber are fine as the detectives. In addition to Balding Steve Doubet and Juli Andelman are similarly likable. Brad Rearden is great in the role of the nerdy Mason Engels the films' one true tragic character. And horror genre icon Barbara Steele is a treat to watch in a nonspeaking role.Lovers of the horror films from this period should find a fair deal to enjoy here. The Silent Scream is enjoyable stuff that deserves a viewing from them.Seven out of 10.".

There's barely any blood or gore and the story tends to drag on at times especially since the deaths take too long to happen and are too quick when they do.All in all Silent Scream does set the creepy and Gothic tone well but it does boring and far paced but overall the film works simply down the good turns from the cast.".

I couldn't have been more wrong! There actually is a plot a surprisingly low body count and even the few characters that do get knocked off are appealing in their own strange way so you can't help but care what happens to these people. And above all there is some terrific suspense sequences. It usually takes alot to get my adrenaline running but at some points in the film I literally jumped out of my seat! Any horror movie that can do this for me is truly something special. It appears to have been made on a small budget but the cast handles it all so professionally that it hardly matters. Indeed there are some real professionals involved including horror mavens Barbara Steele and Yvonne DeCarlo. Unfortunately it's a tough movie to find and not likely to be sitting on the shelf of your local retailrental store but it's well worth the extra effort.".

Too bad really since this definitely is one best slashers I've ever seen and there are several reasons why other horror buffs should check it out as well. The plot of Silent Scream is simple severely clichd and predictable but it still offers some genuine frights and delightfully gore murders. Four university students rent rooms in a large and ominous seaside mansion owned by a timid old lady and her oddbehaving son. Shortly after the first of four students is brutally stabbed to death and it becomes clear that there's another extremely dangerous family member living in the hidden rooms of the house. I really liked how unpretentious this movie was! Due to the limited budget there isn't that much spectacle but the creepy atmosphere and uncanny location make up for this. Whenever there's an empty moment in the script the camera creeps through the halls of the big house seemly aimlessly but nevertheless very spooky. Silent Scream is obviously inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's milestone Psycho and borrows quite a lot of successelements from it like the isolated mansion the freaky son and the awkward family situation. That's not negative criticism though as this film has enough style and competence to stand on its own. And although very shallow the biggest reason why I liked it so much is probably because Barbara Steele plays a very memorable supportive role. She's in her forties here but still amazingly attractive and... crazier than ever!".

This film and Friday the Thirteenth came out in 1980. The Silent Scream seems to have been somewhat lost though it really is way better than the other and its entire franchise. We get a very creepy old house by the sea and a group of college students in need of rooms to rent. Mason Engles the young nerdy boy of the family handles the business as his mother stays cooped in her room in the attic. Soon young people start getting butchered. First one man by the surf another in the laundry room  no need for a laundry list here. The murders are not particularly grizzly  certainly not by today's standards but the acting believe it or not is miles ahead of much of the dreck in films of this ilk since. No wonder as we have Yvonne De Carlo as Mrs. Engles Barbara Steele in a truly bizarre role of a mentally frustrated psychopath who dresses as an adolescent but is in her fortiesand still beautiful I might add Cameron Mitchell doing a workmanlike job in a small role as a cop along with Doritos pitchman and comedian Avery Scrieber playing it straight as a detective. Rebecca Balding is our heroine and she is refreshing and lovely. The house is very eerie and we get back corridors and all that plus a basement and attic to die forokay to die in. The story is trite hackneyed predictable or any word you would like to use that means something we have all seen a hundred times but the acting and the atmosphere are pretty good. that is quite a complement because I didn't think much of the direction especially that stupid slowmotion beginning of Mitchell and Scriber coming in the house and seeing the murders. You wonder first if the house has some history of murder but then just wonder why the director went that route at all. An intriguing film especially in the context of when it was made.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let it begin. PostHalloween slashers are in force. But this just made it in before the major onslaught and admirably it's a above par entry. Actually it probably has more common with Psycho  and touch of Black Christmas than most braindead slashers. The onenote story is quite typical and fairly bare on building much in the way of subplots but it's the dreary underlining atmosphere that smothers the gloomy seaside mansion and invokes a real unsteadiness of slowburn tension. Even the performances lend well and the central outlook on a dysfunctional family who rent out spare rooms in their mansion to students grows incredibly eerie. A silently steely Barbara Steele is memorably striking in her support role while Rebecca Balding is competently fine as the main heroine. Cameron Mitchell and Yvonne De Carlo also show up. There's a subtle stylishness to Denny Harris' direction in many effective sequences where obviously his less concerned about a body count and ghastly shocks. The feel is more like an oldfashioned Gothictale with psychoticdrama currents. A problem though would that there happened to be many flat or deadair moments. Dead silence and believable actions aplenty. It's lowbudget shows and minimal scope gives the film a tight dank and creaky vibe that works.

	onyx:emotionText "Let it begin. PostHalloween slashers are in force. But this just made it in before the major onslaught and admirably it's a above par entry. Actually it probably has more common with Psycho  and touch of Black Christmas than most braindead slashers. The onenote story is quite typical and fairly bare on building much in the way of subplots but it's the dreary underlining atmosphere that smothers the gloomy seaside mansion and invokes a real unsteadiness of slowburn tension. Even the performances lend well and the central outlook on a dysfunctional family who rent out spare rooms in their mansion to students grows incredibly eerie. A silently steely Barbara Steele is memorably striking in her support role while Rebecca Balding is competently fine as the main heroine. Cameron Mitchell and Yvonne De Carlo also show up.

	schema:reviewBody "Originally filmed in 1977 the first version of The Silent Scream was so poorly rendered that the actors and actresses had to be called back for a second shooting. The final rendition was released on August 7th of 1980. Directorial newcomer Denny Harris would try his amateurish hand at producing a horror film  in particular that with a zesty Slasheresque appeal. We must keep in mind that by 1977 Slasher films were not formularized and the usual setup commonly found in this sub genre was slowly becoming more common Bob Clarks '74 classic Black Christmas truly got the ball rolling in my opinion. Unfortunately Harris would not further his career as a director or proceed down the avenue of show business a second time.The story concerns Scotty Parker a college transfer who arrives too late to sign up for oncampus housing and is forced to seek elsewhere for suitable living accommodations. On the edge of town she spots a large estate situated high up on a cliffside flanked by the shore line. Through these arrangements she is introduced to two other housemates  Peter Ransom a young college man with a rich father and Doris Prichart. Jack Towne arrives the following day to complete the group of students. A highschooler by the name of Mason Engels and his mother own the house. Both mother and son share a tragic past and exhibit strange behavior as a result. After a drunken evening of larking around Peter stripped of his faculties is stabbed to death on the beach by an unknown assailant. A police Lieutenant and his partner spring into action and discover evidence that uncovers the dark history of the Engels family Victoria Mason's sister was committed to a psychiatric ward 15 years earlier. Is she to blame for these grisly crimes?Barbara Steele Victoria Engels  a scream queen that solidified her status in 1960's Black Sunday La maschera del demonio. In 1961 she starred alongside Vincent Price in the Roger Corman Edgar Allen Poe adaptation The Pit and the Pendulum. In 1965 audiences also witnessed her appearance in the lowbudget chiller Nightmare Castle. If these references don't ring a bell perhaps you've seen her in 1978's Piranha directed by Joe Dante. The Silent Scream would be Steele's only theatrical appearance of the 80's.Yvonne De Carlo Mrs. Engels  A classic film starlet that was born in 1922 De Carlo made her film debut in 1941 and it wasn't until 1964 that she received her breakthrough role in the comedic TVseries The Munsters. Yvonne's career was not relegated to horror alone for her work encompassed a wide variety of roles that spanned over the course of 54 years. She passed away in 2007 at the age of 85 from natural causes the same year that Denny Harris succumbed to a battle with cancer.Avery Schreiber Sgt. Manny Ruggins  a multitalented individual who shared a passion for comedy during the 60's and 70's. For those of you who've seen Robin Hood Men in Tights he was the tax assessor who took Robin Hood's castle away by a horsedrawn carriage. Yea yea. You vow we move. Let's go boys! Take it out! I always thought he shared an uncanny resemblance to my high school literature teacher in Junior year. But as the bearer of bad news I should inform you that Schreiber died of a heart attack in 2002.Now that we've reviewed the more wellknown actors of the big screen what about the rest of the cast? Rachel Balding takes on the lead role of Scotty Parker. Balding has done a fair amount of television work but does not hold extensive credit as a film actress. Her inexperience as a theatrical actress is irrelevant however as I believe her work in The Silent Scream was abovepar from what we've come to expect from low budget Slasher types. The rest of the cast play nicely in correlation with her leading tone resulting in a job well done. The production values are on queue and don't miss a beat so it's nice to see things pan out the way they should despite a low budget.The Silent Scream doesn't waste too much time attracting red herrings to a bug zapper. The premise is straightforward and won't stray too much from your expectations. A slight twist at the end will have you second guessing yourself but this technique shouldn't be looked at as too severe and the result isn't distracting in the least. The level of carnage is subtle and relies more on clever cinematography and a competent level of editing as opposed to overthetop bloodshed that many Slashers from the 80's relied on. What we see in The Silent Scream is more representative of how horror films started out  which in my opinion is a nod to the classics established long ago.I'm satisfied to end this review on a positive note with a film like The Silent Scream. It will certainly provide you with that dreaded feeling of there's someone in the house! but I wouldn't say that it's downright terrifying. Any fan that deeply assesses horror movies will inform you that a film's expression of fear is not a requirement in the traditional sense as for you casual fans why not celebrate a title that pays tribute to the old days? It may be this level of appreciation that transitions you from the leisurely spectator of the genre into a knowledgeable student of dark cinema.".

We've all been rooked into watching or attending movies that turned out to be radically different than what the trailers implied. One of my biggest memories of this was Silent Scream which had a highly memorable trailer that basically revealed the creepy high point of the film. At age 10 I wasn't prepared for the fact that the movie itself was more atmospheric than thrilling not to mention a body count that tops out at a modest 2. I begged my parents to take me to see Silent Scream at the drivein and then I think I fell asleep halfway through the movie because I was so bored.Now that I'm considerably older I got the chance to see Silent Scream again and I can appreciate it for being a very enjoyable film somewhat lacking in the gore department but otherwise bizarre enough to hold one's interest for the brief runtime of the film. Whether you enjoy the film or not will probably depend on your own fondness for the motheaten elements of horror cinema such as spooky cellars cobwebs galore and secret passageways that lead to nothing but trouble.Perky Rebecca Balding is a college student whose desperation for a place to stay leads her to a foreboding mansion that anybody in their right mind would flee in a heartbeat. With three other boarders living there too there seems to be safety in numbers that is until one of them is found stabbed to death on the beach. How long before our heroine becomes the final girl who has to confront the morbid secrets of the bizarre family who rents out their rooms? The worst thing about Silent Scream is that the plot of it is rather obvious. The family who presides over the seaside mansion consists of Yvonne DeCarlo the matronly elder and a young boy named Mason who is way too young to be her son even though he seems to think that he is. Since Barbara Steele's name is in the credits of the movie too it isn't hard to figure out that when she doesn't show up right away she's a surprise that'll be dragged out later. The first time you actually see her on screen in the film is one of the movie's biggest highlights. Her performance is actually quite disturbing and effective amid the silly slasher stuff that goes on.In fact all the the actors are good here. Yvonne DeCarlo doesn't have much to do but she's a formidable presence in the film nonetheless. Cameron Mitchell is on hand too upping the cult movie factor here even further. Considering that it's clearly a slasher film inspired by the success of films like Halloween and Friday the 13th it's worlds apart from the countless cookiecutter slasher movies that followed. The gratuitous nods to Psycho help lend it some weight and you gotta love any movie with a secret passageway that leads up to a secret room in the attic.".

	schema:reviewBody "Silent Scream starts with one of the most annoying opening sequences I've seen in a while. An entire scene involving police pulling up outside going into searching  making a gruesome discovery in the attic of a large Mansion is shown in highly irritating slowmotion  seems to go on forever. Not a good start only a few minutes in  Silent Scream has already got on my nerves! Silent Scream then goes into flashback as the story which leads to this event is told. Student Scotty Parker Rebecca Balding has transfered to Santa Rey College at very short notice  once enrolled she sets about finding a room to stay in. After no luck searching Scotty comes across an old Victorian Mansion situated high on some cliffs above the sea  beach whose owners Mrs. Engels Yvonne De Carlo  her geeky weird son Mason Brad Rearden rent their spare rooms out to students just like Scotty. Already living there are two more students named Doris Prichart Juli Andelman  Jack Towne Steve Doubet. Scotty accepts one of two available rooms the other is taken by another student named Peter Ransom John Widelock at the same time. That night the four new friends decide to go out to dinner. On their way back home a drunk Peter after being a jerk gets left behind  is murdered. His body is discovered the next morning Lieutenant Sandy McGiver Cameron Mitchell  his partner Sergeant Manny Ruggin Avery Schreiber are on the case. They question Scotty Doris  Jack but get nowhere they then decide to investigate the Engels family to see if they can dig something up on them. Eventually they do but are they in time to save the students from a dark secret that has been hidden for years!Executive produced cowritten  directed by Denny Harris I thought Silent Scream was a waste of time  throughly unimpressive. The script by Harris Wallace C.Bennett Jim Wheat  Ken Wheat is extremely slow nothing significant happens for long stretches. It's over half an hour of tedium poor character development  scene setting before anything that even resembles horror takes place. The body count is extremely low with just one death for over an hour! The ending was also a big disappointment with a dull socalled shocking revelation that really isn't anything like being shocking surprising or interesting. In fact Silent Scream ends as you would expect it to I honestly thought the filmmakers would have tried to come up with a twist ending  catch potential viewers out but no such luck unfortunately. Forget about any blood or gore just a few red splashes on curtains clothes  walls  while watching the end credits I noticed there wasn't any special effects credit listed which tells you everything you need to know! There is a sex scene but no explicit nudity. Technically Silent Scream isn't too bad the house  locations used look OK even if the talentless Harris can't evoke any kind of atmosphere from them  generally speaking it's adequately made throughout although it ain't going to exactly knock your socks off. Acting is alright there are some genre veterans in here including Yvonne De Carlo Cameron Mitchell  Barbara Steele. Overall Silent Scream at best is merely watchable as there is nothing really wrong with it I suppose but at worst it sucks because it's far too slow uneventful  nothing of interest really happens for most of it's running time. Unfortunately for both me  Silent Scream the negative aspects of the film easily outweighed the positive better luck next time chaps. The more I think about it the more I think Silent Scream would have worked a lot better as a half an hour Tales from the Crypt 1989  1996 episode. There are much better horror films available watch one of those instead.".

It takes place entirely inside a big but cramped house and a lot of the action during the climax occurs in the attic. And the body count aside from the killers' deaths is only 2! Yep 2. That has got to be the lowest body count for a slasher in horror movie history. To make things even more underwhelming the murder scenes for those two aren't very good. What's really funny is as low as the body count is the story boasts not 1 not 2 but 3 psychospotential killers the mother the woman played by Barbara Steele and the young nerdy guy. The flashback is confusing and the film starts with get this the actual end of the movie which basically shows us dead people lying on the floor. We don't know who's who on the first viewing but still what a boring a lazy way to start a horror film. All in all I have to say that this micromovie was not worth watching.".

That has got to be the lowest body count for a slasher in horror movie history. To make things even more underwhelming the murder scenes for those two aren't very good. What's really funny is as low as the body count is the story boasts not 1 not 2 but 3 psychospotential killers the mother the woman played by Barbara Steele and the young nerdy guy. The flashback is confusing and the film starts with get this the actual end of the movie which basically shows us dead people lying on the floor. We don't know who's who on the first viewing but still what a boring a lazy way to start a horror film. All in all I have to say that this micromovie was not worth watching.";

However somebody kills two of them and the two left are fighting for their lives. But who is it...and why?Pretty mild horror film. The killings are pretty tame as is the one sex scene. The dialogue is terrible and the film looks cheap. It feels like an R rated made for TV film. Also except for De Carlo and Steele both wasted the acting is lousy. Still I sort of liked this. It's competently directed and there were a few minor chills here and there. There's also one VERY gruesome scene where a pregnant teenage girl tries to hang herself.

The night she moves in one of her newfound friends is murdered on the beach. While the police investigate Scotty stays in the house to fall in love with Jack unaware that the killer is lurking between the walls.For some reason I never saw this early slasher flick despite a pretty wide video release on the Media label. Checking it out 27 years after its debut it is a pretty effective little horror film that mixes the old dark house scenario with the popular slasher trend of the time. The first hour or so is pretty standard stuff. It is in the last half hour that the film really makes it point. Once Scotty discovers the hidden path in the walls it is a pretty good freak out with a deranged family. Best of all you have a wonderfully deranged and wordless performance by Barbara Steele as the psychotic killer Victoria. Despite her character having a lobotomy she is still hot! Cameron Mitchell and Avery Schrieber ! have small supporting roles as the cops investigating the case. Director Denny Harris handles the scares well with the end in the attic being rather suspenseful. Sadly this is his only feature to date. Composer Roger Kellaway delivers a really nice score as well. Writersproducersbrothers Jim and Ken Wheat went on to direct EWOK THE BATTLE FOR ENDOR and the horror anthology AFTER MIDNIGHT. They then took sequel writing duty churning out THE FLY II parts of ELM STREET 4 THE BIRDS II THE STEPFORD HUSBANDS and IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE II.

Released shortly after John Carpenter's Halloween ushered in the era of the psychoslashervs.hornyteenagers film but before all the succeeding wannabes the picture is far more than and for superior to the average adolescent sliceanddicer including that same year's Friday the 13th. In the film pretty Sonny Parker desperate for lodging rents a room along with three other college kids at an elegant old Victorian house by the sea. The home's owners Mrs. Engels and her son Mason are both decidedly odd but the rooms seem clean enough and at only 50 a month quite the bargain. Too bad though that a knifewielding maniac soon begins to make quick work of the funloving teens....In one of the interview extras on this Scorpion Releasing DVD the film's director Denny Harris mentions that his favorite horror picture is Psycho mine too by the way and that 1960 classic leaves its imprint all over The Silent Scream. From the use of staccato strings on the soundtrack to add jolt to those knifings to the peeping Tom behind the wall hole to the decidedly Bernard Herrmannlike music in other spots the film really does play like an homage to Hitchcock's scariest masterpiece. Harris primarily a director of TV commercials excels here in this his only film while Roger Kellaway's background music as mentioned is often quite nerve racking in addition the rock and roll tune that Kellaway wrote for the film I Love You Baby Oh Baby I Do is quite catchy and is used to supercreepy effect. The film features an excellent cast of both old pros and newcomers and all give winning performances. Rebecca Baldingwho this viewer only remembered as Billy Crystal's hateful girlfriend Carol David on TV's Soap although others may recall her from 1981's The Boogensstars as Sonny and easily carries the lead role here she comes across as sexy spunky smart and admirable. In a small but crucial role former sex symbol Yvonne de Carlo underplays nicely as Mrs. Engels those viewers who only know Yvonne as Lily Munster might want to check out some of her really vamp roles from the 1940s such as in Criss Cross while Cameron Mitchell and former funny man Avery Schreiber hey baby boomers Remember the comedy team of Burns  Schreiber? make for an unlikely yet likable pair of cops. And then there is Barbara Steele who without a single line of dialogue absolutely uh steeles this movie despite her short screen time. The initial look at Babs accompanied by music that is reminiscent of the scene in Psycho in which Lila Crane explores Mrs. Bates' bedroom is chilling in the extreme and the actress is able to generate subsequent shudders with just her facial expressions alone. Just look at the gleam in her eyes! As I've said before not for nothing has Barbara Steele been dubbed The Queen of Horror she galvanizes every scene that she appears in here. To my delighted surprise The Silent Scream turns out to be essential viewing for any Barbara Steele fan!A final word about this Scorpion Releasing DVD itself It is a superb presentation with an excellent print of the film and over an hour's worth of interview extras with Balding and the Wheat Brothers Jim and Ken in which the film's writers detail how they recast Harris' original film rewrote and reshot entire chunks and emerged with a superior work. To the Wheat Brothers' credit The Silent Scream emerges as much more than your average gore fest. The teens here are likable and have differentiated personalitieswe care about themand the Engels family tragedy at the film's core is an affecting one. Another fascinating extra an audioonly interview with Denny Harris recorded shortly before his death that gives further insight into the making of this surprisingly artful film. In all a superior DVD presentation of a picture that is well deserving of a new audience....".

	schema:reviewBody "The slasher film was one of the more popular eighties horror subgenres and as a result a lot of truly awful slashers were made. This one isn't particularly brilliant but it's more than decent and has more going for it than the vast majority of similar films from the same period. Most of the eighties output was directly influenced by John Carpenter's overrated Halloween but this film appears to take more from the original slasher  Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece Psycho  than the aforementioned modern slasher which is definitely to the film's credit. The film puts it's focus on just one location that being a boarding house near to a beach. The house is run by Mrs. Engels who leaves her son Mason in charge as she prefers to stay locked in her upstairs room. Scotty Parker arrives at the house after searching all over town for a room. She gets a room there and pretty soon she is introduced to the other three house mates and mingles with them well. However it soon becomes clear that there's a member of the household that she hasn't been introduced to and it's not long before one of her newfound friends turns up dead.I have to be honest and say that I probably wouldn't have bothered tracking this one down if it wasn't for the fact that it features the great Barbara Steele. Steele doesn't get the lead role but she is by far the most memorable thing about the film with her deliciously insane character. The plot plays out very directly and there is little or no attempt to be clever at all. This certainly isn't a bad thing however as it means that writerdirector Denny Harris with his only film is able to put the focus on the popular slasher elements such as murder and atmosphere. The film isn't very bloody compared to its counterparts films such as Friday the 13th but there's a few brutal murder sequences contained within the film and this is sure to please slasher fans. The foreboding and tense atmosphere is a result of the focus on the central location and the old house at the centre of the film gives it a nice feel throughout which is also one of the film's main assets. The conclusion is somewhat predictable but you can't expect much else from this sort of film and while Silent Scream isn't massively impressive it's better than a lot of slashers and comes recommended to fans of the subgenre.".

I believe there was a voiceover saying something about a silent scream. Visually that's all it was  camera zooming up a staircase.I thought it was possible and it was also suggested to me on either IMDb's I Need to Know or Horror message boards that this was a trailer for Silent Scream 1980. However there was not a staircase like that in the movie and unfortunately no trailer was included on the video. For some reason I also wonder if it could have been a fire safety promo or an antiabortion ad.So even though I'm not keen to watch the movie again I would like to see the TV trailers for it!".

The story action and characterisation are so ordinary that it never really makes a mark on the viewer.The plot Rebecca Balding takes a rented room in a large cliff top mansion along with 3 other students. The house is ominous the family who own the house are creepy and one by one the students start dying. Cue police investigation that turns up nothing noises in the attic romantic subplot secret passages etc etc.On the whole the film just isn't exciting. Although it employs heavy duty horror music almost constantly and loudly to try and make things seem frightening the murders are tame and the first hour of the film borders on boring. Things pick up after the big reveal and the plight of the final girl takes a satisfying turn for the worse but this extended climax is diluted by some fairly weak acting from a couple of pivotal characters and again the dramatic music is laid of with a trowel in attempt to convince you that something really scary is going on when it's notSo don't expect to be scared. Sadly the gory excesses of other films of the early 1980's make Silent Scream seem very tame. And viewed today it hasn't really got enough going on to recommend it on any other level either. Shame.".

A slasher film at heart the film is low on gore and body count but genre favorite Barbara Steele as crazed Victoria is certainly a highlight. Her off balanced take on Victoria is simply chilling and gives this good looking movie its chills. The Police in this movie are silly and come straight out of 1970 TV cop shows. The movie goes all in on the slow reveal of who is doing the creepy stalking and killing but it could have used some more punch in earlier scenes. See it for Barbara Steele's great performance.".

Odd films like these dwell on a darker more rarefied level one that hasn't been visited much in the intervening years. Newly released on DVD after 29 years The Silent Scream is a noteworthy entry in this later category of period horror. Until last year it had been lost in the mysterious silvery mists of screenscream antiquity.Barbara Steele stars as the villain in this dated '80's Americanmade shocker. Good character development strong performances and relatively little gore distinguish this effort from the usual slasher fare.Here's the setup Cute and saucy Scotty Parker Balding transferred to her university a couple of weeks late and missed out on the fun of bunking with a bunch of freaks she doesn't know in the dorms.

Creepy 50's music is mysteriously wafting down through the air vents and who's burning that light bulb up there and thumping around at night? The cops show up and an erstwhile detective Mitchell starts keeping an eye out the desolate beach. But with more secret passages hollow walls trap doors and concealed rooms than H.H.

With plot elements of all of these movies The Silent Scream could be an unremarkable horror yarn but instead it manages to add a fresh twist to the genre and establishes itself as one of the more memorable 'old scary house at the top of the lonely hill' type movies.While not the bloodiest '80's slasher piece The Silent Scream offers genuine tension with a distinctive and offbeat feel. There's plenty of atmosphere for a small budget but wellproduced '80's horror flick and a few stylishly shot memorable scenes that will stick with you. And yes it is a flick in very since of the word. No not a film a flick. Write that down. Not so much a horror story as a thriller about a seriously dysfunctional family The Silent Scream's plot falls a bit short in that it misses out on some chances to include more twists and turns but it's still a good ride for nostalgic '80's horror fans.PRODUCTION NOTES Barbara Steele is noted for her Giallo and Eurothriller characters among other types of roles. Despite Yvonne De Carlo's tremendous body of dramatic work viewers may remember her best for her role as Lily Munster in The Munsters television series. Cameron Mitchell appeared in numerous horror and thriller films in the 1980's and Rebecca Balding may be familiar to audiences from her part as Trish in The Boogens 1981 as well as for a gigantic volume of television work. Jim and Ken wheat are the writerproducers behind films such as A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 Pitch Black The Fly II and The Birds II.The Silent Scream was first filmed in 1977 by Denny Harris. The original project was scrapped then picked up and reproduced by Jim and Ken Wheat who constructed new sets around fifteen minutes of salvageable footage filmed at the original location house. A more appropriate house in Highland Park was used for the exterior shots in the reshoot.As an aside The Silent Scream is one of the first horror movies to use CGI editing techniques. According to old timers those antiquated souls who were coming of age in the 1980's everyone wondered how they did that. Apparently general audiences weren't that computer savvy in the nearly presilicon medieval 1980's.Utilized in establishing shots under the opening credits the CGI created the illusion that the action in each frame was halted abruptly for a moment and frozen in time. This same result was achieved with freezes during the opening credits in the 1979 Chuck Pierce film The Evictors. In that instance good old fashioned film lab printing techniques were applied to frames in the opening sequence to give a sense of antiquity to the past events they portrayed and to emphasize the significance of those shots to the plot's subsequent events. Today CGI editing is overused and abused so much that we take it for granted.Thanks to the newly established company Scorpion Releasing The Silent Scream has been rereleased on DVD in high definition after 30 years of obscurity as Silent Scream not THE Silent Scream. The soundtrack has been remixed in true 5.1 and 2.0 stereo with bonus featurettes audio commentary and interviews.".

People who want to read Dostoevsky and people who want to know what one of his books is about also have separate needs.  I am a Dostoevsky lover and have read THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV in several translations no I don't know Russian.  This film hits all the necessary high notes to cover the book's plot and so the screenplay serves the film well.  The brothers themselves Yul Brynner Richard Basehart Albert Salmi and William Shatner turn in variable performances.  Basehart comes in first place with Brynner smoldering not far behind. A young William Shatner shows promise while Salmi's inexplicable whine is almost unbearable which is a shame because Salmi was a good though underused actor.  Stealing the show from the brothers in every scene he's in is the wonderful Lee J. Cobb.  Fans of the book will be disappointed at the excisions but they were necessary to pare the story down to a workable movie.  And though I love the book and think it may be the world's great novel I prefer the ending of the movie! Dostoevsky's book is openended as he intended it to be an introduction to characters he intended to use in further book  but he died before it was written.  So the movie wraps everything up nicely.  Ivan's end scene is much preferable no spoilers though!  See the movie and read the book!. Although Alexei is the main character in the book he's basically an observer. Dmitri perfectly captured by Brynner is the powerhouse of the book and should be the focus in a dramatic adaptation as he is here.  A worthy effort in making an unfilmable novel filmable.  If you want to know what the book is about but a thick novel is daunting this film tells you everything you need to know.".

There's no possible way a novel of the length and complexity such as Brothers Karamazov can be done justice to by the cinema even given 145 minutes.This 1959 Hollywood version deserves full marks for summarizing and depicting the plot faithfully but since so much of the essence of the book is missing one cannot help feeling the pointlessness of the entire exercise.Director Richard Brooks manages to sustain the emotion intensity of the piece keeping the proceedings on an intimate scale David Lean no doubt would have blown it up to epic proportions. The cast are largely satisfactory with Yul Brynner is at his charismatic best as Dmitri and Claire Bloom is spot on as Katya. Iridescent Maria Schell is far too genteel for the earthy Grushenka a part Marilyn Monroe somewhat misguidedly felt she was born to play according to Hollywood lore. Lee J.

	schema:reviewBody "After watching this film for the first time I can see where Jerome Weideman got the inspiration for the novel that became the basis for the films House Of Strangers and Broken Lance. The Menottis of the first film and the Devereauxs of the second were definitely inspired by The Brothers Karamazov.The feelings for the father are the only thing that unite these four distinctly different brothers. Lee J. Cobb is a hard drinking hard wenching two fisted patriarch who is determined to beat everyone else in the game of debauchery. He's getting good competition from son Yul Brynner and it arouses some jealousy even though Brynner is engaged to a nice girl in Claire Bloom who also has a father giving both of them a run at that game. Things do come to a head when Brynner takes an interest in another woman who Cobb is currently keeping company with. In fact Inger Stevens and Cobb have a complicated scheme to get Brynner under their thumb through his gambling debts so he's forced to marry Bloom and start living respectively.The other brothers are unique individuals themselves. Richard Basehart is a reporter for a radical newspaper with budding revolutionary thoughts. William Shatner is a pious novice monk he and Basehart are a study in contrasts. Finally there is Albert Salmi who claims Cobb as his father and who Cobb treats like a doormat. Not that this brutish sadistic thug is worthy of anything. All of the sons suffer from a lack of a strong father figure.The climax is when Cobb is murdered and Brynner is arrested for the crime. Fyodor Doestoyevsky is not Agatha Christie people who like murder mysteries will have that solution figured out. But Doestoyevsky was writing this novel as a character study. Each of these brothers represent an extreme in terms of a way of living be it radical politics religion debauchery or even brutish strength. An amalgam character of all of them would be a well adjusted man.The Brothers Karamazov got one Oscar nomination Lee J. Cobb for Best Supporting Actor. Papa Karamazov is certainly the kind of role that one cannot possibly overact in and Cobb feasts on enough scenery for three films. He lost the Oscar sweepstakes to another patriarchal portrayal that which Burl Ives did in The Big Country.After over 50 years The Brothers Karamazov holds up very well it's a good film and a good introduction to the works of Doestoyevsky. Try and see it back to back to back with House Of Strangers and Broken Lance.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is not a review. See other comments of those who liked this film. For me it is one of the two worst films of literary masterpieces I have ever seen the other being The Sound and the Fury. The actors were all fine. The father is wrongly characterized but well played by Cobb. Brynner is excellent as Dmitri. They are less ambiguous and so more easily screened. There is no way that anyone could capture Ivan though Basehart does his best. And Alexei? It's not Shatner's fault that this role is written so terribly. As you can see I absolve the actors of the crime committed by the film. Perhaps it is not Maria Schell's fault either that she mugs and grins her way through her ridiculous part. But I kept wishing she would stop smiling just once stop smiling whatever emotion she thinks she is conveying. I felt this intensely both when I saw the film in 1958 and 2010. If anything Schell is worse than Joanne Woodward in the Faulkner film when the latter says And this fine old house just falling to wrack and ruin about our ears Nothing in the film Karamazov of course about how the miraculously preserved corpse of Zosima starts stinking in short order. And predictably of course not a hint of the Grand Inquisitor. The worst omission by far however is the boys shouting Hurrah for Karamazov at the end of the book. Critics once voted that line the greatest single line in all of literature second only to Look up Nicholas look up! in George Eliot's Middlemarch. It's not that I expect a film to capture anything but glimpses of a great work but this film is a travesty. Marilyn Monore would have been a big plus as she was in The Misfits. The first time I saw this film I hadn't even read the book which I've since read many times and tend to think is one of the world's greatest novels. Well what can one expect from 1950s middlebrow Hollywood? It's like penciling a mustache on the Mona Lisa to make it more accessible. No thanks.".

His four grown sons are DimitriYul Brynner an attractive wealthy officer who is betrothed to rich Katya Claire Bloom the monk is named AlexiWilliam Shatner a writer named Ivan Richard Basehart and the bastard Albert Salmi. Dimitri falls in love with a beautiful woman named GrishenkaMaria Schell but she's the father's lover. Then emerge the tensions  drama and tragedy when brothers and father struggle with their desires for the same women.One of the most interesting films based on the novels by the fascinating Russian writer Feodor Dostoevsky  Crime and punishment. The writers Julius and Philip Epstein Casablanca kicked out most of the psychological undertones of the original. This overlong picture is confined by the demands of melodrama and packs some flaws and gaps. Nevertheless it is full of masterly touches and unexpected flashes of intelligence. Nice performances by all star cast  especially by Richard Bashehart William Shatner and Lee J. Cobb does an overacting. And Maria Schell who does a sensible and smiling performance as Grushenka whose role Marilyn Monroe attempted desperately to get. Colorful cinematography by John Alton a noted cameraman expert on noir cinema.Good and intense direction by Richard Brooks. He was a fine writerdirector so consistently mixed the good and average which it became impossible to know that to expect from him next. Firstly he worked regularly as a Hollywwod screenwriter. After that his initial experience of directing was one of his own screenplays called Crisis. The Richard Brooks films that have the greatest impact are realized during the 50s and 60s as Cat on a hot tin roof Something of value Elmer Gantry Sweet bird of youth In cold blood Lord Jim and the Professionals and of course The brothers Karamazov .".

When I came to New York as a graduate student though it happened that my roommate was an even bigger Brynner fan than I and I soon found myself in what amounted to a one week Brynner marathon. The Brothers Karamazov was the 2nd film we watched. And I loved it. It felt strange to think so back then and it feels strange to write it now. But I loved it.As a fan of both Classic films and literary classics I haven't read Brothers Karamazov but I have read several other classics and thoroughly enjoyed them I know that the first is almost always 180 apart from the latter. No one needs to tell me this film is probably only 20 of the original novel and changedrearranged to boot. Doesn't matter. I still enjoyed it. I have never watched a film classic that so moved me drew me in and made me forget that the year was 1958. Brynner is at his most vulnerable here and the actors portraying his brothers all did topnotch jobs such a good job in fact that I was able to watch William Shatner Captain Kirk to anyone remotely Trekkie without even chuckling as well as the leading ladies. Mr. Cobb deserved his Oscar. What a wonderful performance. The man must've had a blast playing Fyodor Karamazov he cavorts about with energy and flair. The best scenes are whenever he is on screen with all four sons around him although I liked this film so much that at this point favourite scenes would include 90 of the film.Truly a wonderful work. Don't hesitate as I did to treat yourself to this cinematic jewel.".

Brynner is at his most vulnerable here and the actors portraying his brothers all did topnotch jobs such a good job in fact that I was able to watch William Shatner Captain Kirk to anyone remotely Trekkie without even chuckling as well as the leading ladies. Mr. Cobb deserved his Oscar. What a wonderful performance. The man must've had a blast playing Fyodor Karamazov he cavorts about with energy and flair. The best scenes are whenever he is on screen with all four sons around him although I liked this film so much that at this point favourite scenes would include 90 of the film.Truly a wonderful work. Don't hesitate as I did to treat yourself to this cinematic jewel.";

Dostojevsky.Richard Brooks is a great director but that film is on a very low level.The worst part of the film was the ending. Well let's think of the book. In the end we have the guilty Dimitrij Karamazov. Afterwards they sent him to Siberia. In the end the famous epilogues of Dostojevsky the friends and family making a plan to save him. But that's it ... a nd now the film takes two steps more and shows us an illusion ending of the escape of Dimitry and GruschenkaI think. just from the moral point I'm sure that Dostojevsky would finish the book with an open end because one the one hand he is not guiltySmerdjakov is the real murderer and so he have to be a free man. But on the other hand he goes to his father to kill him so he has decided to commit the crime... that's a moral dilemma and so the following point is an open end...well for real it's just not full open.William Shatner as Aljoscha Karamazov... I'm sorry!  NO!!!The others characters playing in a good performance as we have to expect it from such great actors ... In front of course a superb performance of Yul Breynner as Dimitrij. I think that there are not many actors who can play this part in a better way.But as I said in the beginning This book is unadaptable. It never should be film in two hours that's impossible. I think that there are some 'longer films so maybe they could do the right thing... But I just keep the opinion that this book can't be adapted.So  3 pointsA point for the great director Richard Brooks A point for a superb performance of Yul BrynnerFinally A point for one of the greatest writers of all time Dostojevsky".

	schema:reviewBody "The Brothers Karamazov has quickly become one of my favourite books with its riveting story interesting and thoughtprovoking themes and some of the most brilliant characterisation of any book how many pieces of literature have characters this multidimensional? I've ever read. This 1958 film version does pale in comparison lacking the book's depth of characterisation but does a brave job adapting a monumental and complex book with some scenes being impossible to film and is a solid film overall.It's not perfect. Sometimes the film is stodgily paced some might say overlong not to me considering the length of the book and the amount of story there is if anything the film's too short. The ending was always going to be a reasonably problematic one with it in the book being as openended as it is but this viewer couldn't help shake off the feeling that the ending felt too rushed and incomplete here. Most of the casting came off surprisingly well but there were reservations about Maria Schell despite her alluring appearance and her impressively played early scenes she was generally too genteel for Grushenka a role that was in need of more earthiness and peasantlike.However The Brothers Karamazov looks great with lavish colour photography and an evocative recreation of the opulent but also gritty 19thcentury Russia period. It's scored with a stirring yet also understated richness by Bronislau Kaper and does benefit from controlled direction by Richard Brooks and a literate script that really provokes though and even when condensed with the essence and the religious and philosophical themes missing makes an effort to keep to Dostoevsky's tone of writing and giving the film substance. It is not an easy job adapting a nearly 800 page book into a twoandahalf hour film and while not completely successful due to feeling sometimes like highlights being present but not always to their full potential and major characters being significantly reduced Alexei Zosima at the expense at focusing primarily on Dmitri it does so laudably. It is still mostly riveting and there wasn't much trouble following the story with the major events depicted and structured relatively faithfully and there is enough atmosphere suspense emotion and mystery to give the story some flavour.From the acting front the film comes off surprisingly successfully considering that initially there were a couple of actors that seemed unlikely casting i.e. William Shatner. The two that came off the most strongly were Yul Brynner and Lee J. Cobb. Brynner is very charismatic and gives the right emotional intensity and vulnerability while Cobb gives his patriarchal role so much juice and life his demeanour sometimes even quite intimidating the role is a problematic one due to being one that could easily fall into overacted caricature Cobb admittedly does overact but enjoyably and the character still felt real. Richard Basehart brings many layers and nuances to Ivan Claire Bloom is spoton as Katya and Albert Salmi is effectively insidious as Smerdyakov. William Shatner does suffer from a greatly reduced in terms of how he's written character but surprisingly this is Shatner at his most subdued and moving most of the time in his acting for personal tastes he's the opposite.All in all pales in comparison to the masterpiece that is the book but it is a brave attempt. Taking it on its own merits which is a fairer way to judge The Brothers Karamazov has shortcomings but is a solid film overall. 710 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "It is usually fashionable to attack film versions of famous novels for their indifference to their source. Certainly The Brothers Karamazov was not allowed to escape the critical treadmill. However I do not propose to discuss how much greater the film might have been if it did this or didn't do that but how it actually is Virtue number one is John Alton's photography  easily the finest in color yet seen. Notice how he contrives to illumine Katya's face as a pale waxy texture how Smerdyakov's features are lined with green Feodor's with red how he makes great play with shadows how pleasingly he always lights the charming contours of Grushenka.Virtue number two is William A. Horning and Paul Groesse's art direction cluttered claustrophobic interiors contrast muddy streets and drifting snow.Virtue number three Bronislau Kaper's music with its richly reminiscent aura of Tsarist Russia.Virtue number four Richard Brooks though hardly our choice for the production handles his material with great assurance and considerable competence.Virtue number five Pandro S. Berman for his decision to film in Technicolor Metroscope rather than CinemaScope.Finally the acting Lee J. Cobb's is a juicy amalgam of Johnny Friendly and the Yiddish Art Theatre Yul Brynner's is forceful and sensually elegant Claire Bloom's is effective as the somewhat unrewarding Katya. It is nice to see Richard Basehart in a role he can handle after La Strada and Moby Dick I was beginning to doubt his ability.Maria Schell is superb as the celebrated Grushenka her handkissing scene with Katya is brilliantly realised.Newcomer Albert Salmi makes Smerdyakov a notable example of creative interpretation.As for Alexey his position is somewhat honorary he appears as a draped figure of hovering solicitude and some inscrutability now and then he lays on a restraining hand tears rise repeatedly in his eyes. He is impersonated with no pretensions whatever by a young actor named William Shatner who it is safe to guess will have no truck with the teenage trade.To sum up It may not be perfect Dostoveski but as a film  a definite must.".

Notice how he contrives to illumine Katya's face as a pale waxy texture how Smerdyakov's features are lined with green Feodor's with red how he makes great play with shadows how pleasingly he always lights the charming contours of Grushenka.Virtue number two is William A. Horning and Paul Groesse's art direction cluttered claustrophobic interiors contrast muddy streets and drifting snow.Virtue number three Bronislau Kaper's music with its richly reminiscent aura of Tsarist Russia.Virtue number four Richard Brooks though hardly our choice for the production handles his material with great assurance and considerable competence.Virtue number five Pandro S. Berman for his decision to film in Technicolor Metroscope rather than CinemaScope.Finally the acting Lee J. Cobb's is a juicy amalgam of Johnny Friendly and the Yiddish Art Theatre Yul Brynner's is forceful and sensually elegant Claire Bloom's is effective as the somewhat unrewarding Katya. It is nice to see Richard Basehart in a role he can handle after La Strada and Moby Dick I was beginning to doubt his ability.Maria Schell is superb as the celebrated Grushenka her handkissing scene with Katya is brilliantly realised.Newcomer Albert Salmi makes Smerdyakov a notable example of creative interpretation.As for Alexey his position is somewhat honorary he appears as a draped figure of hovering solicitude and some inscrutability now and then he lays on a restraining hand tears rise repeatedly in his eyes. He is impersonated with no pretensions whatever by a young actor named William Shatner who it is safe to guess will have no truck with the teenage trade.To sum up It may not be perfect Dostoveski but as a film  a definite must.";

Maria Schell Grushenka and Lee J. Cobb the murdered father stand out of a congregation of an ideal acting ensemble. Yul Brunner as Dimitri Claire Bloom as Katia Richard Baseheart as Ivan William Shatner as Alyosha and Albert Salmi as a perfectly loathsome Smerdyakov are all perfect in their performances leaving nothing out the music is perfectly fitted into the constantly changing and dramatic moods of ever increasing tension but the greatest credit goes to the writerdirector Richard Brooks who has succeeded with the impossible to give one of the most complex and polyphonic novels a digestible cinematic form. He adds to the show by including some extra scenes to make the drama easier to grasp like a considerable foreplay to where the real start of the novel the family congregation at the Starets Zossima's. I saw this film some 40 years ago and have never been able to forget the performances of Maria Schell and Lee J. Cobb and the pleasure of reviewing them in what could have been their best performances was a welcome return of a great delight. It was a special satisfaction to observe how Richard Brooks has succeeded in underscoring the romantic element of Dostoievsky he is in fact the greatest of romantics although well covered under a massive outfit of humanity intelligence psychology and the faculty of anatomizing human nature. The romance here is that between Dimitri and Grushenka totally hopeless because of the circumstances but therefore the more heightened. It is very interesting to compare this film version with the Russian complete screen adaptation of 2008 which will be reviewed later. They definitely complement each other.".

This adaptation is almost exclusively focused on the adventurous and romantic side of the novel missing out more important aspects as the characters psychology which is roughsketch the critical analysis of religion and the existence of God the reflection about the human condition moreover it's absolutely unbalanced in terms of characters treatment Dmitri seems to be the absolute protagonist around which revolves the story so Ivan and Alexi are reduced to supporting characters with no substance and interestingly enough it's just Ivan Karamazov the most important and complex character of the book the author himself speaks through him although The Brothers Karamazov was conceived by Dostoyevsky as a biography of Alexi Karamazov so if there's a protagonist that's just Alexi Karamazov however the novel is choral enough it can't identify an absolute protagonist.There's two memorable moments in the book which don't find a place in the movie both of them involve Ivan I'm talking of the The Grand Inquisitor poem and the encounter with the devil towards the end I consider them two key passages without which The Brothers Karamazov wouldn't be so great. On the other hand I can understand why they didn't include that kind of passages in the movie due to their verbosity I think however The Brothers Karamazov is a verbose novel it's an inescapable aspect which makes this novel sublime The Brothers Karamazov is mainly a philosophical and psychological work let it be clear it'a a lot of things it's a crime story it's a love story it's a legal thriller but all that is absolutely marginal compared to the depth and the authenticity of the characters it's an amazing study of human nature well this authenticity and this depth were totally lost in the movie the characters turn out to be stereotyped and melodramatic except the father played by Lee J. Cobb that I liked. Richard Basehart who played Ivan was definitely too old for the role Ivan is 24 years old whereas Basehart was 44 when the movie was filmed he looked clearly older than Yul Brynner who was supposed to be the elder brother even if the actual age of the actors is not so important it's necessary to keep a consistency with the original characters in my opinion. Yul Brynner was decent enough as Dmitri Dmitri himself is the character more faithful to the original however I found Brynner good in the action sequences but a little expressionless in dramatic ones. What to say about William J. T. Kirk Shatner? I don't consider his performance so bad I think his role was just poorly written this Alexi Karamazov is just without personality. In short I consider this adaptation a sort of The Brothers Karamazov for dummies in the sense that it was totally deprived of its cerebral content what remains of this monumental masterpiece is the umpteenth Hollywood's melodrama with the classic and lived happily ever after ending which was totally overturned compared to the book's in Douglas Sirk style. If I should indicate a director who would have been able to do a great job with this story at that time I'd say Ingmar Bergman and I'd have liked to see Marlon Brando in the role of Ivan Karamazov only two geniuses like those ones would have been able to do justice to this story but now they're passed away as well as the time when it was still possible to make this kind of movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "From RKO studios in 1936 though it looks as though it were made in the earliest 30s during the heyday of the AstaireRogers musicals came something rich and strange.  Maxwell Anderson's very serious poetic play was boiled down into a movie that's part Depressionera gangster flick part Shavian socialissue drama and part neoGreek tragedy.The igniting fuse was the Nicola SaccoBartolomeo Vanzetti case of 1927 where two immigrant anarchists were condemned some would say railroaded to death supposedly for a robbery in which guards were killed.  Anderson pushes it back to 1920 and focuses on a single man Bartolomeo Romagna John Carradine whose auto filled with anarchistsocialist tracts is stolen for a similar crime by gangster Eduardo Cianelli.  When condemned Carradine eloquently rebukes the judge Edward Ellis.The film now flashes forward to 1936 when Romagna's downandout drifter son Burgess Merdith spurred by revisionist theories of the case journeys to New York to confront the surviving principals including Cianelli Ellis and a reluctant witness Paul Guildfoyle.  All converge for a reckoning preordained by The Fates....Anderson has heightened his dialogue to lend it immortal aspirations which may have been a grandiose miscalculation  the dominant rhetorical mode of the twentieth century obvious even by 1936 is flatting.  The highflown posture extends to the look of the film too  a stylized nightscape that's a harbinger of the look of film noir to come a few years later.  A lowceilinged tenementbasement flat is oppressively claustrophobic markedly so given the number of actors crammed into it while the cobblestones and stone arches of the lowrent streets near New York's waterfront glisten wickedly in the pelting rain.  At times the slums look like the central squares of those Transylvanian villages so common in Universal horror pix of this era.Almost every element of Winterset should seem laughable now  but doesn't though there are a few close shaves.  There's an early sequence involving a hurdygurdy that lures the slumdwelling underclass out of its burrows to dance that's hauntingly powerful  as is the face of Winterset's love interest an actress known as Margo that harks back to the expressiveness of the silents.".

	schema:reviewBody "The drama itself is interesting to watch in this adaptation of Maxwell Anderson's play and the themes that it brings out include some particularly weighty ones. The solid cast included at least three performers who were continuing their Broadway roles and while the production does have a stagy feel at times it often seems rather appropriate to the material.The brief prologue shows a political extremist who is presumably also an immigrant wrongly accused and executed for a murder committed by a holdup gang. The circumstances are similar to those in some notorious real cases of a slightly earlier era in which politically unpopular persons were railroaded into convictions because of the public's fear of their beliefs.The main action starts with Burgess Meredith portraying the executed man's son now an adult and determined to get to the bottom of the case despite the obstacles that have come with time. In the course of things he encounters the judge who had presided over his father's trial a witness with important information and a brutal crime boss who is determined to prevent the case from being reopened. The setup produces some good psychological and ethical tensions in addition to the drama on the surface.Most of the supporting cast performs well. John Carradine has a brief role as the father Margo has a good and important role as a young woman torn between family loyalty and her attraction to Meredith's character and Eduardo Ciannelli believably portrays the soulless desperate crime boss. Mischa Auer succeeds in a brief atypical role as a street agitator. But Edward Ellis gives the best performance as the judge whose conscience has been tormented ever since the fateful case. The characters and the tragic situation that links them are all effectively portrayed.".

The movie is full of substories full of details that bring back the early days of everyday troubled life for Americans especially New Yorkers. While not actually typical the story is one that hangs together.I suspect the story plot and actor management of the story were perfected on Broadway long before going to film. It is both engaging and fascinating for movie buffs who are students of the perfected BW film and is a study in filmography which makes one wonder if this is not the height of perfection if you will concerning films of that genre Good story good delivery and good conclusion.The story is not one with a tragic ending for the principles. It is not one that builds up the viewer's expectations and hopes and then dashes them in the end. While there are hints of evil and tragedy the people most deserving receive this end the ones who deserve the best of the ending actually do get the best in the end.The organ music is superb for selection and for an almost hypnotic melody that plays on in one's head for some time afterward. A nice pleasant melody. And on it hangs the turning point in the movie a grand hook to hang the ending.The antics of the policeman is what one would expect of one of New York's finest of that era. A masterful job of acting.Most of all Margo! She was again engaging spellbinding and her job welldone. She caused the viewer to want to provide her sympathy from a good and kind father who was incapable of doing all he could for his children and to a brother who was caught up in a crime and later regretted it and who endeavored to correct his mistake. Again superb acting.Overall Winterset stands out as one of the most enjoyable movies I have ever watched. I try to share it with friends who have never seen it before.

	schema:reviewBody "I like this film. It is an interesting retelling of a point of view regarding one of America's most controversial trials  the 1921  1927 legal ordeal of Nicolo Sacco and Bartholomeo Vanzetti for the murder of two men in a payroll robbery in Massachusetts. Both were Italian anarchist immigrants in the U.S. Both were convicted by juries which were local Yankee in makeup not having any nonYankees on them. Certainly no Italian Americans. The judge Webster Thayer was an openly bigoted man. But thousands of people around the country and the world attacked the verdict and demanded a retrial. Among those who attacked the trial was George Bernard Shaw Edna St. Vincent Millay Sinclair Lewis Fiorello La Guardia and in a move that opened his later great judicial career Felix Frankfurter. After going through appeals and the revelations of a fellow prisoner that the payroll robbery was committed by a local criminal gang the matter was left to a small commission headed by President Lowell of Harvard College. It turned out to be a whitewash. In the end the two men were electrocuted. Thayer's and Lowell's reputations never recovered from this.Scholars on the case are still divided on the guilt or innocence of the two defendants  some have suggested they were both railroaded or that Sacco was more likely to be guilty but Vanzetti was probably innocent. Today nearly eighty years after their deaths they still remain a flash point regarding American bigotry. In 1977 on the 50th Anniversary of their deaths Governor Michael Dukakis formally pardoned both men.Maxwell Anderson wrote about the subject twice the play WINTERSET and the play HIGH TOR. Anderson's reputation as a dramatist has been inflated over the years by critics like Brooks Atkinson. He could occasionally write a well done play but he was not on the level of his contemporary Eugene O'Neill. O'Neill's tragedies especially his final ones was based on personal demons from his family and his life. O'Neill was also willing to experiment on stage with masks THE GREAT GOD BROWN or with internal counterdialogs STRANGE INTERLUDE or even with trilogies based on Greek originals MOURNING BECOMES ELECTRA. Anderson only experimented one way  he tried blank verse plays ELIZABETH THE QUEEN MARY OF Scotland and did not do it too well. But here he obviously was passionately determined to defend the memory of the two Italian  American anarchists. His plot is based on developing the thread of the confession mentioned above that the murders were planned by a local criminal gang. The gang's leader is Eduardo Cianelli a brutal criminal who framed the two men by stealing their car as the getaway car.But the strength of the confession is furthered by claiming the judge was bribed Thayer was biased but not bribed. Edward Ellis best recalled as the missing inventor in THE THIN MAN is the corrupt jurist who is now a wandering derelict. Vanzetti's famous final letter from the death cell an elegant final comment that is the basis of contention between Henry Fonda and Eugene Palette in THE MALE ANIMAL is the basis for the elegant denunciation of the judge in the court by John Carridine note that his character's first name is also Bartholomeo. Ironically today it is believed that elegant final message of Vanzetti may have been written in part by a reporter who supported the defendants.The son and daughter of the dead men Burgess Meredith and Margo are seeking to prove their innocence. But they run against the determination of Cianelli and his goons. The film is fascinating enough and concludes satisfactorily much more than the actual case did. The plot's conclusion also leads to a more prosaic point  if you plan to use a signal to destroy someone don't forget that signal and use it yourself. See the film to understand that last point.".

	schema:headline " Early Gothicnoir sets the standard.";
	schema:reviewBody "Despite having read the liner notes I thought from the publicity artwork that WINTERSET would be something Gothic. It is Gothic in its bleakness but is squarely centered in the Depression era of the United States. It was completely of it's time and considering that the film was adapted from the Broadway play it must have been daring with sub themes of socialism and police corruption. The play was by Maxwell Anderson who wrote KEY LARGO and THE BAD SEED. Perhaps that contributed to the film receiving two Academy Award nominations.This is the story of Mio Bartholomio  a young dewy Burgess Merideth trying to clear his father's name. In the first scenes his namesake Father played with riveting stillness by the painfully thin John Carradine was accused of murder he did not commit given no defense and put to death. Years later his son goes to the slums of New York to try to find out the truth.I had to remind myself that this was made in 1936 so it is still very early in the talkies. The sets are a wonderful blend of realism and expressionism similar to the famous stage sets of Arthur Miller's A VIEW FROM THE BRIDGE giving this a Gothic noir flavor. Rain is often used as a purifier in stage and film but here it is effectively used to create an oppressive humidity a torrent of sludge. It is clear that film noir Orson Wells and THE THIRD MAN's Director Carol Reed all owe a debt to early films like this. The set elements are all here in tight proximity the stone the shadowed doorways the waterways.In fact one irony is that one of the lead actors does look very much like Orson Wells. He plays the brother of Mariama played by Margot who is probably best known as the duplicitous woman in Capra's LOST HORIZON. Margot's transition to film is not as ideal as Merideth's her style is more of the old school careful vocal production that may be the product of overcoming an accent. But she looks luminous and innocent and fills the screen with a simple hopefulness at odds with the dark surroundings. The villain of the piece is simply fantastic completely believably sociopathic without any extravagant ticks or frothing at the mouth.This is premethodacting but that spare realism is all here especially in the performances of Carradine and Merideth. This entire film holds up as a moment of history  of social themes and thought of that day that still resonate. The Broadway cast seems to have been lifted intact which should be a lesson to modern filmmakers to use stage actors instead of viceverse. There are one or two flowery monologues but for the most part the transition from stage to film goes very well and the story and script are spare and universal enough to stand the test of time well. This is a fascinating moment of film history which has luckily  made its way to DVD.".

The problem is not so much the leftist slant of the film but that ALL of the dialog comes off as incredibly stagy and fake. Not one minute did I feel that the characters were real or that this was supposed to be real lifeand it felt like an overly 'deep' play that was brought to the screen without any concern for how watchable the final product would be.Winterset is a story that is a thinly veiled retelling of the SaccoVanzetti trial of the early 20th century. While there was an apparent rush to judgment to convict and execute the two anarchists of murder there is evidence today that would suggest that at least Sacco was guilty. Decades after the executions of the pair Hollywood leftists took the case under their wingsand even today it's a famous case for its miscarriage of justice. This film is an after the fact retelling of the case. While the case is interesting in many ways however the film is absolutely dreadful because it is so earnest and selfimportant. In other words the story seems so superior and unreal in the way it was toldand the characters all come off as onedimensional and fake. While leftists like the leading man Burgess Meredith must have been filled with a sense of selfimportance while making the film they never seemed to bother to look at the story to see if it seemed real in any way. Had they done this they would have clearly rewritten the film and made the characters more realistic and the dialog at least halfway convincing. Instead it just seemed like a very long and drawn out preachy polemicthe sort of film the public would ignore and the film makers adore. The bottom line is that this divisive and confusing case deserves a better treatment than this filmwhich looks more like a propaganda film than anything else. Fake fake and fake from start to finish as NO ONE talks the way these characters did.".

	schema:reviewBody "WINTERSET was a big hit on Broadway and RKO's decision to retain Burgess Meredith Margo and Eduardo Ciannelli to repeat their original stage roles is a major reason for the success of the film version. That they were able to adapt their performances to the intimacy of the camera is remarkable. Maxwell Anderson's dialogue is naturalized considerably from its poetic original but enough of the beautiful lyricism is retained in Anthony Veiler's screenplay to make it a very special script. While Ted Hecht must have been very good on Broadway as Garth Paul Guilfoyle's performance in the film resulted in perhaps his best and most important screen work. Two other performances deserve special mention. Stanley Ridges as Shadow is menacing without being paranoid as is his boss played by Ciannelli. Ridges' bloody appearance in the Esdras doorway is one of the most shocking screen moments in 30's cinema. And Willard Robertson who made a career out of playing impatient meanies is beautifully obstinate as the boorish patrolman. Russian actor Maurice Moscovitch makes his screen debut as Garth and Miriamme's father. A veteran of the Yiddish Theater Moscovitch later played Paulette Goddard's father in THE GREAT DICTATOR but died before that picture's release. Another Russian Mischa Auer makes one of his rare dramatic appearances as a social radical.The physical set is beautiful especially the stonestyle recreation of the alley and stairwells beneath the Brooklyn Bridge. Finally the film boasts a rare original score by Nathaniel Shilkret. Shilkret was a longtime bandleader who made records for RCA. He was hired as part of the RKO music staff in 1936 to replace Max Steiner who was leaving to join fledgling org SelznickInternational. Shilkret's bold compositions for WINTERSET enhance the theatricality of film though most of the dupe prints extant on video reproduce the soundtrack with very limited fidelity.For modern audiences with little patience for playsmadeintofilms that represent their stage origins WINTERSET will be a disappointment. But for those who can appreciate the care with which director Alfred Santell took to recreate much of the prosaic beauty of the Broadway original WINTERSET will be a rewarding experience  if you can see it in a respectable copy.".

	schema:reviewBody "Going in I had no idea that this film had it's inspiration in the famous SaccoVanzetti trial of 1927. Now that I do I don't find that it makes much difference. I have some real problems with this picture not the least of which is the way it brings the characters together. Case in point  the judge from the original murder trial of 1920 shows up as an amnesiac wanderer in a New York City slum doesn't remember his own name and then comes around to recall the events of a case for which he carries sixteen years of regret for not really knowing the truth of it. His crusade brings him to the exact location where a mobster Eduardo Ciannelli a witness to the original crime Paul Guilfoyle and the son of the convicted man sixteen years earlier Burgess Meredith all converge to set up a final climactic showdown in the battle of good versus evil. Now think about that  what are the odds? Overlooking these highly improbable aspects of the picture I can see why some other reviewers on this board give it higher marks than mine. The characters are portrayed with earnest sentiment and the overriding sense that justice must win in the end propels the picture forward. But I just couldn't escape the idea that gangster Estrella Ciannelli would have been left unscathed if he had just left things alone. He didn't seem to have anything to do with the trial that opened the picture he wasn't even there and there was nothing in the story to implicate him or his associates in the payroll robbery crime. Yes we saw him do it but it seems no one else in the story did.You know I like Burgess Meredith and it was really cool to see him in a film he made forty years before becoming Sylvester Stallone's trainer in the Rocky movies. It gives you an idea how far he came as an actor from this his first credited big screen role and in the lead no less. He's surrounded by a handful of competent supporting players as well notably the single named Margo as his love interest Miriamne and Guilfoyle as the conflicted brother Esdras. But overall I think the best performance here was John Carradine in his damning declaration of innocence to open the picture a brief but moving encounter before the judge who would eventually lose his way. My compliments as well to director Alfred Santell for the effective use of those magnificent stone arches and alley ways lent a particular sinister ambiance by the night time elements. Also for the clever way bad guy Estrella was brought to justice without ever getting to the bottom of the original case.".

Burgess Meredith Margo and Eduardo Ciannelli recreate their stage roles from Winterset in this 1936 film. But the story itself is horribly dated mostly with a lot of left wing rhetoric which gets in the way of the plot.Probably back in 1936 no one cared as the cause of SaccoVanzetti was still fresh in everyone's mind. Today it is still debated by historians and legal scholars and the two working class ItalianAmericans are still venerated in ItalianAmerican households of a more liberal persuasion in their politics. But the average American today knows the case vaguely if at all today.The men went to the electric chair in Massachusetts protesting their innocence as does John Carradine in this film. Before Carradine dies he imparts a sense of mission to his son who grows up to be Burgess Meredith to find the real guilty parties.A review of the case by a law school class saying that the state electrocuted the wrong man brings new attention to the case not something that Eduardo Ciannelli likes. He was the real trigger man in the case and now he's a big shot gangster.Rather improbable events bring Meredith Ciannelli the judge Edward Ellis now a drunken derelict Paul Guilfoyle another accomplice Guilfoyle's father Maurice Moscovitch and his sister Margo all together on a rainy and stormy night.Maxwell Anderson wrote the original play and I have to contrast it with another of his plays that made it to the screen Key Largo. It was another film where various folks are trapped in a storm and interesting things happen. Winterset never really sheds its stage origins and can't shake the rhetoric. Contrast that to Key Largo which never loses your interest for a second and while most of the action takes place in a closed down out of season hotel where the cast is holed up you never get any sense of staginess in it. The rhetoric is there but it never gets in the way of the story as in Winterset.Even with Oscar nominations for Art Direction and Musical scoring Winterset is a relic of bygone days.".

The ironic twist with which the villain is cornered caps a superlatively constructed and cleverly thoughtout narrative. I waited years to see Winterset. It did not disappoint. A great script enthralling performances and superb production values make this film an absolute must. It's hard to believe that some of these players are making their movie debuts. Yet Burgess Meredith and Paul Guilfoyle never surpassed their acting here. In fact Guilfoyle never equalled his role here. Neither did Margo. Nor Alec Craig. Nor even Ciannelli though he did come close a couple of times. It's also hard to believe the movie was directed by Alfred Santell. Here he abandons his usual plodding and humdrum style to use Ferguson's vast and imaginatively depressing sets with flair and authority. He punches the drama home with forceful camera angles sharp cutting and a remarkably skillful use of props and effects. Although it brilliantly makes use of theatrical effects this is a movie not a photographed stage play. Peverell Marley's atmospheric photography also reinforces the inner and outward tensions the unnerving urgency of Winterset.".

	schema:headline " The curse of an innocent man is more powerful than the curse of a monster.";
	schema:reviewBody "This play is a product of the depression much like Dead End The Petrified Forest and Tobacco Road. It is not something that could probably be revived today outside of theater companies that specialize in the most rare classics. Yet the themes resonate today wrongful arrest organized crime extreme poverty and especially mankind's incredible inhumanity. It is an adult themed film that requires attention to details much like the same year's Fury and might stir up animosity towards a society that continues to psychologically slap the poor the immigrant and anybody deemed to be an outcast simply trying to find justice. As a child Burgess Meredith witnessed his father John Carradine sentenced to death witnessed his father quietly place a curse on the judge for killing an innocent man and witnessed the lights go off miles away in the death chamber. The sudden discussion of the case in law schools brings Meredith to New York to find some answers and it leads to not only a confrontation with the criminal mastermind Eduardo Cianelli and the aged judge Edward Ellis who is now a shell of himself. Meredith must decide how he will deal with what he discovers falling for the sweet Margo ironically the sister of a much troubled man who was in the car who opened fire on the payroll manager whom Carradine was accused of killing.With its poetic almost Greek tragedy like setup Winterset isn't a feel good film of any nature.

	onyx:emotionText "This play is a product of the depression much like Dead End The Petrified Forest and Tobacco Road. It is not something that could probably be revived today outside of theater companies that specialize in the most rare classics. Yet the themes resonate today wrongful arrest organized crime extreme poverty and especially mankind's incredible inhumanity. It is an adult themed film that requires attention to details much like the same year's Fury and might stir up animosity towards a society that continues to psychologically slap the poor the immigrant and anybody deemed to be an outcast simply trying to find justice. As a child Burgess Meredith witnessed his father John Carradine sentenced to death witnessed his father quietly place a curse on the judge for killing an innocent man and witnessed the lights go off miles away in the death chamber. The sudden discussion of the case in law schools brings Meredith to New York to find some answers and it leads to not only a confrontation with the criminal mastermind Eduardo Cianelli and the aged judge Edward Ellis who is now a shell of himself. Meredith must decide how he will deal with what he discovers falling for the sweet Margo ironically the sister of a much troubled man who was in the car who opened fire on the payroll manager whom Carradine was accused of killing.With its poetic almost Greek tragedy like setup Winterset isn't a feel good film of any nature. Residents of the slums dancing under the Brooklyn Bridge and ordered away from there by the police a heavy downpour and segments of almost a dreamlike nature gives this a unique look. Meredith is outstanding in his film debut and Ellis delivers a quiet troubled performance that was deserving of Oscar recognition.

Just the other way around it embraces it's trashiness by having the villain jumping around in balletlike moves and similar things. This is one thing that makes this movie very likable. The other is that it is just so funny. If you are not offended by extreme violence and gore.The theater was packed with the special kind of audience that is attracted to the Fantasy Film Fest the kind of audience that will applaud and cheer when a head gets cut off and gallons of blood get poured around. But the cheering didn't stop there. As soon as the audience got into the movie and got over an initial impression of crappiness like a very rudimentary set bad editing with scenes that were often just a bit too long and actors that were with the exception of Stephen Dorff sub par it became clear to them that the movie is intended as a comedy and delivered funny and unexpected scenes one after another. And the laughter continued throughout the whole movie.I really enjoyed the movie a lot and in retrospect did not notice that it was actually 100 minutes long although cutting 10 minutes off would have helped.For it's great entertainment value and isn't that what movies are all about ?  I give 7 points. I cannot give less to a movie that I enjoyed so much even if it has a lot of shortcomings on the technical side.".

The first half of the movie is more traditional with real characters and a halfhearted attempt at a plot. The second half however is basically just a splatter comedy and it pretty much abandons all the plot elements of the first half in favor of absurdist humor and gore. In that sense it's somewhat like Peter Jackson's Dead Alive.If you like black comedies splatter comedies or cult movies you should check this out. Just be warned it's a bit low budget and if the thought of Satanic serial killers with really bad Russian accents doesn't make you giggle you'll probably find this movie insultingly stupid.".

	schema:reviewBody "Botched starts as Ritchie Stephen Dorf is involved in a car accident after just having robbed an auction house of valuable diamonds not wanting to be arrested Ritchie flees the accident sans the diamonds. Mr. Groznyl Sean Pertwee who Ritchie works for is not happy that he lost the diamonds but decides to give Ritchie one more chance he orders Ritchie to go to Moscow  steal an ancient gold Crucifix. However things again go wrong  Ritchie finds himself trapped on a skyscraper floor with two of Groznyl's men  a bunch of hostages as he tries to figure out what to do in order to get out of the building alive  without being arrested but there is someone else there too a psycho killer who starts to kill everyone off...This German Irish British  American coproduction was directed by Kit Ryan  seems to be one of those films that divides opinion some seem to love it's bizarre sense of humour  madcap plot while other's like me think it's a complete mess that fails at everything it sets out to do. I heard lots of views that that say there's lots of twists but I thought the story was predictable  the ending in particular was an unclear mess that was too eager to get the two main male  female leads together. I heard many people say that Botched is funny  again I just can't see it the humour is so obvious  poorly staged that there's more laughs during the average funeral. The whole film is terrible the plot is just rubbish the gore is minimal  the socalled comedy is just awful. I don't think I laughed once. The character's are silly one dimensional idiots there are plot holes galore  there's even a terrible ending the story the character's  villains are just not engaging enough. The whole thing plays like a cross between a gangster flick like Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels 1998 a barebones slasher flick  some madcap Police Academy farce where stupid character's get into stupid situations  the whole thing just escalates or so the makers would have hoped. Unfortunately the gangster elements are poor  barely figure the horror elements amount to a few silly death's  the comedy is just so unfunny. So what we have is Botched a horror comedy where both the horror  comedy is of the poorest sort. I saw it on telly for free  I still feel rippedoff.This is quite well made although the constant grey corridors get boring. There's no real excitement  there's definitely no scares tension or suspense as the silly moronic comedy is so distracting  in your face. The gore isn't even all that someones head if chopped off there's spikes through feet a fridge of guts dead bodies hanging up a chopped off hand gag  a decent amount of fake blood but Botched never really goes for it in either the horror or gore department.Apparently shot in Ireland  in Russia the film looks nice enough with good production values. The acting is terrible the accents are beyond irritating  annoying  look closely at leading Man Stephen Dorf because he looks totally bewildered at what's going on with a sort of stoned look on his face in most scenes. A special mention goes to Jaime Foreman who has to have put in the worst single performance in a film I have seen in a long time.Botched is what it says it is a totally botched attempt at a modern madcap horror crime gangster comedy that was terrible on all counts. Some people seem to like it  that's fair enough but for me Botched was awful.".

	onyx:emotionText "Botched starts as Ritchie Stephen Dorf is involved in a car accident after just having robbed an auction house of valuable diamonds not wanting to be arrested Ritchie flees the accident sans the diamonds. Mr. Groznyl Sean Pertwee who Ritchie works for is not happy that he lost the diamonds but decides to give Ritchie one more chance he orders Ritchie to go to Moscow  steal an ancient gold Crucifix. However things again go wrong  Ritchie finds himself trapped on a skyscraper floor with two of Groznyl's men  a bunch of hostages as he tries to figure out what to do in order to get out of the building alive  without being arrested but there is someone else there too a psycho killer who starts to kill everyone off...This German Irish British  American coproduction was directed by Kit Ryan  seems to be one of those films that divides opinion some seem to love it's bizarre sense of humour  madcap plot while other's like me think it's a complete mess that fails at everything it sets out to do. I heard lots of views that that say there's lots of twists but I thought the story was predictable  the ending in particular was an unclear mess that was too eager to get the two main male  female leads together. I heard many people say that Botched is funny  again I just can't see it the humour is so obvious  poorly staged that there's more laughs during the average funeral. The whole film is terrible the plot is just rubbish the gore is minimal  the socalled comedy is just awful. I don't think I laughed once. The character's are silly one dimensional idiots there are plot holes galore  there's even a terrible ending the story the character's  villains are just not engaging enough. The whole thing plays like a cross between a gangster flick like Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels 1998 a barebones slasher flick  some madcap Police Academy farce where stupid character's get into stupid situations  the whole thing just escalates or so the makers would have hoped. Unfortunately the gangster elements are poor  barely figure the horror elements amount to a few silly death's  the comedy is just so unfunny. So what we have is Botched a horror comedy where both the horror  comedy is of the poorest sort.

There were more chase scenes than a Bond film but these had a ring to the old TV series Benny Hill. I honestly expected the killer to grab someones backside and eventually the Benny Hill music playing in the background. I don't want to even get started on the killer it was a cross between the Highlander  Rocky. Rocky because Rocky sounded more Russian than this guy.The Russian accents were laughable the only thing the film lacked here was each cast member playing a Russian to have a bottle of vodka and one of those woolly hats all KGB agents have in classic soviet union movies.This film has got to be the worst film i have seen in years. Please do not listen to these Muppet's stating its not pretending to be art house but plays to its strengths total rubbish. It does not matter which way you describe this the movie is total pap.I shall leave it with one last comment. You are cornered the main character and the piece of eye candy The killer enters the room with his sword and blood everywhere you are hiding behind the curtain with say 10 bodies hanging from hooks you are scared and the killer is about to find you so what do you do............... Well i would run like hell but no Stephen Dorff is way too cool for that he snogs her.In Conclusion WHY oh WHY oh WHY oh WHY".

Everybody's brain dead the logic is thrown down the Russian drain and it just drags on like the dummy rats that it showcases as the summum of special effects.

	schema:reviewBody "Ecstasy 1933 USA 1940 Starring Hedy Lamarr as Hedy KieslerThe world's first glimpse of a 19 yearold Hedy Lamarr occurs in the early moments of this 1930's treasure as she sweeps across the screen in an angelic wedding gown. This was to be the start of a legendary career. This was our glorious introduction to the most beautiful woman ever to grace the silver screen.It is Eva's Lamarr wedding night and her older husband seems uninterested in her romantic advances. She retreats to the lonely bed and in a beautiful scene she fiddles with her wedding ring as the realization of her marital mistake overcomes her. The husband seems more interested in neatness and order than he does in love. Gustav Machaty uses gorgeous camera angles and pristine shot framing to capture Lamarr's considerable talent and beauty. With no words spoken in the early part of the film she is able to grasp our sympathy our hearts and our support. It is that combination that prepared the 1930's audiences for what they were about to see as the film unfolded. 'Ecstasy' was considered shocking for its time... Some thought it to be scandalous.She returns home to her father's estate and files for divorce. The next day she wakes with a complete sense of freedom and happiness. She just has to go outside and feel the freedom of the countryside and fresh air. Eva goes for a horseback ride and happens across a beautiful lake. And in one of the most famous scenes in film history Hedy Lamarr became the first person to ever appear nude in a major film. Her frolic in the woods and her skinnydipping adventure in the lake were legendarily scandalous. But the audiences couldn't stay away. As with many of today's movies the controversy made it a mustsee film.Eva's mischievous adventure introduces her to a handsome young man who helps her find her horse who had run off with her clothes. After an awkward meeting they eventually fall for each other. Their first romantic rendezvous was almost as controversial as the nude scene with its blatant waves of eroticism. However Machaty does beautiful work in these romantic moments. Machaty creates one delightful moment when Eva literally seems to sink into her new lover using a gorgeous early camera trick.It cannot be overstated how brave this performance was on Lamarr's part. Many might have presumed it was career suicide. Instead it gained her worldwide fame and caught the eye Louis B Mayer who signed her to a contract with MGM. There are some truly erotic moments in this film even by today's raunchy standards. It is impossible to imagine how they were received in the 1930's. Again Machaty was very clever with his imagery leaving a lot to the imagination. But we all understand very well what we are seeing and it is supremely well done.The meeting of Eva's former husband and her current lover is perhaps inevitable. However the consequences of that meeting are not. The film takes a few unexpected turns in its final act and it all makes for a great story and a lovely debut on the grand stage of movie stardom for Hedy Lamarr.I highly recommend this once controversial now tame film and urge you to seek it out in its restored form on DVD. It is easily worthwhile if only for the pleasure of seeing Hedy Lamarr. But the story is compelling too and the direction is ahead of its time. 'Ecstasy' is a memorable early treasure.www.tccandler.com  TC Candler's Movie Reviews!!!".

	onyx:emotionText "Ecstasy 1933 USA 1940 Starring Hedy Lamarr as Hedy KieslerThe world's first glimpse of a 19 yearold Hedy Lamarr occurs in the early moments of this 1930's treasure as she sweeps across the screen in an angelic wedding gown. This was to be the start of a legendary career. This was our glorious introduction to the most beautiful woman ever to grace the silver screen.It is Eva's Lamarr wedding night and her older husband seems uninterested in her romantic advances. She retreats to the lonely bed and in a beautiful scene she fiddles with her wedding ring as the realization of her marital mistake overcomes her. The husband seems more interested in neatness and order than he does in love. Gustav Machaty uses gorgeous camera angles and pristine shot framing to capture Lamarr's considerable talent and beauty. With no words spoken in the early part of the film she is able to grasp our sympathy our hearts and our support.

	schema:reviewBody "No need to recap the plot since others have done so already.It's understandable that many viewers find fault with the film raised as we are with the slambang sensurround of today's cineplex experience. Against that background a movie like Ecstasy appears to have wandered in from another planet. I think there are several worthwhile reasons why.Most importantly the film unfolds poetically as the camera pans slowly over surrounding hills trees clouds etc. providing a serene and lyrical sense of a natural world that integrates the man and woman into its fold. Together these reveal a style and dimension almost totally missing from today's technologydriven cinema where rapidfire editing works to divert audience attention and not to concentrate it. Additionally the story is conveyed by eye and not by ear with almost no dialogue to explain what's happening. This amounts to another extreme departure from today's very literal fare where visuals only seem to count when they excite the audience. But perhaps most unsettling the movie is sometimes eerily quiet not in the sense that silent films are quiet since we expect them to be. But in the sense that the characters seldom speak when we expect them to. Thus the burden of the story is shared between the filmmaker and the viewer. The former must choose his visuals artfully so as to convey the narrative while the latter must think about those visuals since they're not going to be explained.None of this is intended to belittle today's filmmaking. It's simply to point out that a movie like Machaty's comes out of a very different aesthetic from the one we have today. I don't claim either to be any better or worse. However I do claim that Ecstasy represents a perspective sorely missing from today's moviegoing experience where such 'contemplative values are routinely dismissed as slow and boring. The film itself is no masterpiece though at times it reaches artistic heights as in the beautifully composed beergarden scene with its final crane shot rising to reveal the exquisite tableau below. The slow pans of the countryside with its pantheistic celebration of life nature and regeneration are also wonderfully expressed. These are the kind of scenes that don't overwhelm you but instead given halfa chance accumulate quietly into an experience as memorable in its own way as the spinetingling variety of a Jaws. On the other hand the film is sometimes heavyhanded as when Machaty piles on the imagery particularly in the final odetolabor sequence. It's hard to know what to make of this rather disruptive presence. Perhaps the symbolism has to do with the heroic dimension that hard work holds for the lovelorn hero and people in general a theme then being promoted by the influential Soviet cinema. Still its presence here is rather tediously overdone.Anyhow I've got to admit that I tuned in initially to see the gorgeous Hedy LaMarr in the buff. But now I have to admit that in the process I also got a lot more than just a peekaboo romp in the woods.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is romanticism in the original 18th and 19th century sense of exalting human emotion and imagination depicting the nature of sex and human relations in terms of powerful elemental forces mirrored and symbolized in nature.  It's prototypical also of European art cinema which I've always had a weakness for.  A romance yes but not in the sense of some smarmy relationship flick.  All that aside it's just strikingly beautiful and a real treat for people who relish earlier styles of filmmaking.  On reading some brief blurbs about the new DVD edition before getting it I kind of got the impression that it was some cheap shocker in the manner of Sex Madness or Reefer Madness which couldn't be further from the truth.As has been remarked it's practically a silent film with a continuous musical score.  Released very early in the 1930s I have to wonder if it wasn't originally conceived and largely shot as a silent and retrofitted for sound.  Spoken lines are never more than a brief sentence or two and most often just one or two words.  This is at a time when American films were thick with dialog taking full advantage of the new sound technology. I think much of the communicative power of cinematography was shoved aside or forgotten with the advent of sound.  Had this picture been done in the United States at that time quite apart from the demands of the sensors a continuous patter of verbal exposition and just plain yammering would have been insistedon by those financing it.  Thankfully it wasn't and we still have this almostforgotten gem to show for it.The direction and cinematography isn't really revolutionary for its time as it uses techniques camera tricks editing and pointsofview that had already been invented by earlier pioneers of silent film but their presence still makes it stand strikingly apart from the vast majority of mainstream films of the era.  There is visual sexual symbolism obvious enough to raise a giggle or two from some modern viewers Eva pensively toys with her ring while lying on the bed on her wedding night one drooping flower drips into another receptively open flower after a violent rainstorm.  It's hardly out of place as sex is at the very center of the film.The musical score is extremely specific to the action and is highly lyrical.  It may strike some modern viewers as a bit too cloyingly sweet but I find it appropriate to the style and powerfully effective for getting you into the spirit of the piece.  It helps evoke the wide range of mood in the film which at the very start almost looks like a whimsical romantic comedy.  The mood darkens considerably as it moves on.A story is told powerfully and with great visual artistry without any superfluous exposition or jabber.  For me it's the essence of cinema.  It was a big surprise for me and I'm grateful for the opportunity to finally see it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dripping with symbolism and filled with marvelous cinematography Extase is so much more than the erotic drama we've all come to expect. This is almost a silent film with what dialogue there is in German and highly simplified German at that. Perhaps the filmmakers intended the film to reach the widest possible European audience as anyone with even a little high school level Deutsch can easily dispense with the subtitles.

This is almost a silent film with what dialogue there is in German and highly simplified German at that.

Throughout this film we're given copious visual analogies to make clear that what we see is the simple working of the powerful wheels of nature. So after she leaves does the world fall apart?

	schema:reviewBody "I cannot comment on this film without discussing its significance to me personally. As a child bad health prevented me from ever going to a cinema. I first encountered movies at the end of WWII through Roger Manvilles splendid Penguin book Film which brought me so much pleasure as my health began to improve that I wish I could buy another copy to reread today. My introduction to many classics films such as The Battleship Potemkin Drifters Grierson's magnificent documentary Metropolis The Cabinet of Dr Caligari and Ecstasy came first through this book and later at my University Arthouse cinema. Ecstasy had incurred the wrath of the Vatican for condoning Eva's desertion of Emil her subsequent divorce and the brief swim she took in the buff but Roger Manville ignored these trivial matters and discussed the film as a triumphant outstandingly beautiful visual paean to love  a view echoed by many IMDb users. A very lonely young man when I saw it I willingly concurred. No further opportunity to see Ecstasy arose until the introduction of home videos  by then it had become a treasured memory not to be disturbed. Quite recently I finally added Ecstasy to my home video collection and found this assessment very superficial. Ecstasy is much more of a parable on the continuity of human existence against which individual lives are insignificant  perhaps a tribute to what Bernard Shaw in his aggressively agnostic writings used to term 'The Lifeforce'. Ecstasy portrays a young bride marrying a middle aged man whose sex urge is no longer strong. Disappointed she returns home and divorces him. Soon after she experiences a strong mutual attraction to a young virile man she meets whilst out horse riding. She makes love for the first time and it is an overwhelming experience. Her former husband cannot face rejection and gives the young man a lift in his car intending that a passing train will kill them both on a level crossing. But the train stops in time and the apparently ill driver is taken to recuperate at a nearby hotel where he later commits suicide by shooting himself. After these exciting climacteric sequences a bland predictable and almost inevitable ending emphasises that whilst individual human lives exhibit both joy and tragedy collectively life continues to carry us all forward in its stream and only through contributing to this stream can we be truly happy. This story is trite the acting is no more than adequate and normally such a film would have disappeared into the garbage as did most of its contemporaries long ago. What has given Ecstasy its classic status is exceptional cinematography a continuous lyrical score and very careful loving direction coupled with something fortuitous but in cinematographic terms very important  it appeared just after the introduction of sound and was probably planned as a silent film. It is subtitled and its Director has exploited the impact of brief verbal sequences accompanying some subtitles and occasionally breaking into the score which so lovingly carries the film forward. This makes it not only almost unique but extremely rewarding to watch. The parable in the tale is stressed continuously but so subtly that only when reflecting after viewing does one become fully aware of it. For example the names  Eva and Adam the obsessive behavior of Emil on his wedding night which shows that triviata have become the most important thing in his life and predicate his eventual suicide since he has no adequate purpose to sustain him the ongoing series of beautiful sequences showing erotic imagery a bee pollinating a flower a key entering a lock a breaking necklace during Eva's virginal lovemaking sequence with Adam etc. and the final postsuicide sequences which could have been filmed in many different ways but serve to extol the importance to individuals of performing some type of work that contributes positively to Society as well as of creating new life to sustain this society after we ourselves pass on. As a 1933 film I would rate this at 9  even comparing it with contemporary works I would not reduce this below 8. For me the film will always remain a must see although you may feel that my background remarks above indicate some bias in this judgment. Unfortunately in North America contemporary assessments of this film have been distorted by the extreme 1930's reaction to Hedy Kiesler's very brief and relatively unimportant nude scene which she had difficulty living down in Hollywood some critics who have clearly not seen such classic films as Hypocrites Hula Back to God's Country Bird of Paradise or some of the early works of D.W. Griffiths and C.B. deMille have even erroneously referred to this as the first appearance of a nude actress in a feature film. This scene was probably part of the original novel and the film would have been very little different if the Director had chosen to rewrite it.Two further thoughts firstly this is a Czech film released there in 1933. Its final message about hard work generating positive benefits for society must have seemed very superficial to its viewers when a few years later their country became the first victim of Nazi oppression and was virtually destroyed for at least two generations I do not remember these sequences being screened just after the war when I first saw this film  were they removed from the copy I saw then?. Secondly for me its main message today is that things of real beauty are often very transitory even though their memory may stay with one for a lifetime. We should all be thankful that today some of them can be captured on camera and viewed again at our convenience.".

I have just watched Extase for the first time and the first remark I have is relative to the horrible quality of the VHS released in Brazil by the Brazilian distributor Video Network the movie has only 75 minutes running time and it seems that it was used different reels of film. There are some parts totally damaged and other parts very damaged. Therefore the beauty of the images in not achieved by the Brazilian viewer if he has a chance to find this rare VHS in a rental or for sale. The film is practically a silent movie the story is very dated and has only a few lines. Consequently the characters are badly developed. However this movie is also very daring with the exposure of Hedy Lamarr beautiful breasts and naked fat body for the present standards of beauty. Another fantastic point is the poetic and metaphoric used of flowers symbolizing the intercourse between Eva and her lover. The way the director conducts the scenes to show the needs and privation of Eva is very clear. The nonconclusive end is also very unusual for a 1933 movie. I liked this movie but I hope one day have a chance to see a 87 minutes restored version. My vote is eight.Title Brazil xtase Ecstasy".

As I watched this fever dream of an exercise in 1930's sexuality I thought YOWZA! They got away with murder in Europe back in the day. Unfortunately this film was heavily cut in it's original U.S. release by the blue nosed Hayes Office the staunch government censorship boardstarted by the holier than thou Bible thumper Will Hayes...a former Post Office officialif you can believe thatdue to it's overall theme of human sexuality Heaven's forbid humans actually had sex in the 1930's. The plot of Ecstasy concerns a young woman played by Hedy Lamarrwho marries a much older manand later regrets it. She Lamarrmeets a handsome younger man  has an affair with him resulting in a divorce from previous husband another no no in Hollywood movies back thenDivorce!.

In that book there's a delightful bit where she describes her famed nude scene as being her fanny twinkling through the woods.  I would kill to hear her say that.  Anyway being a classic movie fan I felt that I should see this movieI purchased the DVD for the ungodly amount of thirty dollars.  I guess it's worth that just to say I've seen film's first orgasm. I don't know what conversation I'm going to fit that into but nevertheless.My impressions of the filmAt first I was a bit unnerved as you're at least 15 minutes into the film before anyone says anything.  I can stand silent movies but I wish I'd been warned first.  Also I'm guessing the plot is basically sexstarved Hedy marrying a man who couldn't care less about carnal pleasure.  Or maybe it's just a dirty movie.  That would be a horrible surprise for Hedy and her new husband is shown to be fanatically picky about where things are placed.  He also goes to bed early the jerk. After Hedy's famed dipandrun she does meet the guy someone said he was a surveyorI guess they paid much more attention than I did and he seems dreadfully flat as characters go.  I can't remember a single thing about him which makes me feel that he's just there for Hedy to use as she pleases.  He doesn't care so I guess that makes it all right.  Then there is the oftmentioned worker scene at the end but since this is a foreign movie there has to be some sort of statement.  It seems that other countries felt compelled to make American films look like pointless trite crap.  Watch this one on a double bill with Metropolis and see which one kills you first.All in all I didn't like this film.  I've probably made that obvious by now.  Hedy is lovely to look at but not lovely enough to hold my attention for a whole film even if she is butt naked.  I always thought she looked rather embarrassed and just downright petrified.  For a Hedy that you can look at for hours go for the Technicolor Hedy in Samson and Delilah. If you want to see her act gasp! watch The Strange Woman.  If you want to see her naked watch this.".

OK on Ecstasy I think the same happened with Adam and Evethat first couple on Earth there was not an apple was a horse that ran with the dress of Eve while she was bathing naked in a river and Adam caught the horse took the dress give it back to Eve then he massaged the leg of Eve and gave her a flowerand with a living bee on it. Perhaps after divorce secluded in her father's house that first Eve used to play the piano too alone and sad and smoke on the balcony probably menthol cigarettes. I'm writing all this not only because the characters of Ecstasy are called also Eve and Adam. Differences that Eve from God's Creation definitely showed total full frontal nudity Hedy Lamarr's Eve shows us only a pair of breasts. That's it that's all. So all those who wrote that the film shows full frontal nudity ate s..t. The film is not erotic it's just a sad and very pastoral romance too soft for that troubled year 1933 in which Hitler came to power. Hedy is sweet and cute but not a great beauty how so many have spoken and wrote I've met myself women more beautiful in my life. The film is well made simply revolutionary for its time. Unfortunately the last 10 minutes perfectly resembles Soviet films from the 30s like Sergei M. Eisenstein's films from the 20s. Influence somehow logical not accidental at all. 8 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "Ae Fond Kiss manages to find appealing freshness in a tale probably older than Romeo and Juliet. There have been many many films that have dealt with the conflicts between young lovers from different ethnic or racial backgrounds and there's strengths and weaknesses in how director Ken Loach and his frequent collaborator writer Paul Laverty avoided some clichs while stridently emphasizing some others. The fresh POV is that the young Glaswegian MuslimCatholic couple is not naive teenagers experiencing love for the first time conflating The Other with sexual discovery but experienced 20somethings who know perfectly well about the vagaries of relationships. He even expresses surprise that she had entered into her first marriage at the young age of 19. In addition this is the first such genre film I can think of where the one in the couple feeling the pull of traditional responsibilities is the guy usually it's the girl who is drawn to assimilate by a handsome charmer. The gender switch provides an interesting dynamic that effectively shows how ethnic and racial tensions add to the simple interactions or the usual up and down strains that any new relationship goes through. For example his seductive reaching out to her on an early date emphasizes his fascination with her wavy blonde hair. While their relationship is allowed to grow gradually out of a mutual interest in music they develop a frankly deliciously sexual relationship whereas most films in the genre gauzily avoid such aspects of interracial romance going beyond Mississippi Marsala. They verbally express their feelings for each other with gentle sparring use of epithets  this is also the first film in the genre I can think of where despite everything they go through they do not declare I love you. Each has complexities and pressures in their personal lives that the relationship complicates. Some effort is made to present the Muslim family's viewpoint as coming out of a protective reflex against experienced bigotry from the violence of the Indian partition on. She points out she can't consider his parents as individuals who are other than bigots if he never lets her meet them. While a younger sister is a conventional rebel it's a risible clich of this genre that she wants to be a writer the older sister has accommodated herself to her cultural requirements in a way to be content in the contemporary world but this leads her to be desperately proactive against the couple. Poignantly communication across the divide is almost not possible that slim reed called love may not conquer all and there is genuine suspense as they split and reunite and split under the stress. The lead actors are enormously appealing and believable so we have great compassion for them. George Fenton's music helps to maintain the romantic atmosphere. On the strident side their meeting cute is by her breaking up a fight between his sister and racial taunters. The bigotry angle is hammered home culturally incongruously by displays of the notorious lynching postcards with Strange Fruit playing in the background. The Scottish brogues are mostly comprehensible to American ears though the specifics of some jocular exchanges are lost. The cinematography well conveys gritty Glasgow.".

	schema:reviewBody "British filmmaker Ken Loach is a rare commodity. The man should be revered. He consistently makes superb films movies that comment on important social issues. And he's never been tempted to go Hollywood.He's appreciated in Europe but he should be in the United States too. I consider Loach and fellow Briton Mike Leigh to be the most socially conscious filmmakers working today. Just look at some of Loach's remarkable films  Kes 1969 RiffRaff 1990 Hidden Agenda 1990 Raining Stones 1993 Ladybird Ladybird 1994 Carla's Song 1996 and My Name is Joe 1998. They may not all be masterworks but they're more emotionally satisfying funny and poignant than most Hollywood films.It's a shame Hollywood doesn't have an equivalent to Loach or Leigh. We have the marvelous John Sayles but he's alone and he too doesn't work in the Hollywood system.In A Fond Kiss Loach and screenwriter Paul Laverty tackle the ageold conflict of starcrossed lovers. In this case it's Casim Khan Atta Yaqub a secondgeneration Pakistani immigrant and Irishwoman Roisin Hanlon Eva Birthistle in Glasgow Scotland. Casim's a DJ with lofty plans to open his own club Roisin's a music teacher at the Catholic school attended by Casim's sister Tahara Shabana Bakhsh. As expected Casim's family made plans for him to marry a cousin. And he's caught between obligations to his family and his love for Roisin.This might seem familiar. And it is. But what Loach and Laverty do is elevate their story to another level stripping off any artifice and making it as sincere human and believable as possible. Biracial couples especially will understand and appreciate the genuine storytelling. The movie's final scene is beautifully written and acted.There's something deeply honest about Yaqub and Brithistle's performances. These aren't Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan pretending to be normal people. There's nothing artificially cute or movielike about Casim and Roisin's romance and relationship. These are two people extremely comfortable with each other. Their conversations are frank their problems are real their anguish and joy ring completely true. Even their lovemaking has nothing artificial about it.Yaqub wasn't a professional actor when Loach cast him. So Yaqub brings certain rawness to his role that's very welcome. But that also exposes his shortcomings. There are moments that require a bit more emotion from Yaqub scenes that would play better if he were stronger. But he gets ample support from Birthistle. This really is her movie.From the first moment we see her Birthistle captivates us. Her reactions to everything that happens to her  from ecstasy with Casim to pain with his sister  there isn't one thing false about her performance. It's so easy for us to sympathize and empathize with her because she draws us in with a wonderfully subtle nuanced and open performance.There's also a superb cameo from Gerard Kelly as a sanctimonious priest.We rarely get to see films such as A Fond Kiss in the U.S. Films that bravely tackle social issues expose our prejudices and force us to think and understand other people and cultures. Loach's oeuvre includes one movie made in the U.S.  Bread and Roses 2000. He hasn't returned to make another one. Pity. Just imagine how much richer the American film industry would be if it had filmmakers of Loach's integrity and caliber.".

It's so easy for us to sympathize and empathize with her because she draws us in with a wonderfully subtle nuanced and open performance.There's also a superb cameo from Gerard Kelly as a sanctimonious priest.We rarely get to see films such as A Fond Kiss in the U.S. Films that bravely tackle social issues expose our prejudices and force us to think and understand other people and cultures. Loach's oeuvre includes one movie made in the U.S.  Bread and Roses 2000. He hasn't returned to make another one. Pity. Just imagine how much richer the American film industry would be if it had filmmakers of Loach's integrity and caliber.";

I am Chinese and my wife Indian and it was quite a tumultuous journey from the day we met to the day that we exchanged our wedding vows. Seeing movies like this always brings us a strong feeling of nostalgia.A Fond Kiss is the love story between Casim a young Pakistani man and Roisin a young Catholic woman with the backdrop being modern day Scotland. Much of the plot revolve around the Casim's family dynamics which is a rather modern Muslim household. We are not given much about Roisin's family but the director gives us a rather bitter depiction of fundamental Catholic dogma. Despite the predictable problems that arise the story is accompanied by a strong performance from the entire cast and the use of common Hollywood lovestory gimmicks are refreshingly absent from the plot.I must note that the performance by Casim's father was especially moving for me you want to judge him quickly for his hypocrisy and bigotry but soon feel for his predicament. The antagonism he has for love marriages arise from his responsibility to love and protect his family and his tribulations in the past have made him weary of foreigners. I am reminded of the problems I have had with my fatherinlaw for the longest time I hated him so much but only now I see that he's one of the most caring and loving individuals I have ever known and any problems he gave me was simply his way of testing my devotion to what matters most to him his daughter and family.The ending scenes were also beautifully woven together. There are no ridiculous chase scenes or overexaggerated dialogues. The people who ultimately decide their fates are themselves. It is Casim and Roisin who must determine what their destinies are and this nonfatalistic scenario is often the case in real life. I know from my culture as well as my wife's that in many cases marriages are arranged and sometimes forced. Though I try not to make any judgements I am glad that I live in a society where I still get to choose my partner in life.".

More specifically I am floored by their measures of realness. They are individuals guided by distinct codes of conduct. Their values explain their actions and exposes their strengths and frailties.

The Scottish girl is a music teacher at a Catholic school and meets the Pakistani boy when her guitar is broken during a racial incident. So far it follows much of the standard boymeetsgirl line. The romance takes off they find they are getting along swell and then the price comes due.You can see it coming the Muslim Pakistani family coming down on the boy for not going along with his arranged marriage and him going on the outs with his family. But then the price comes due for his Scottish girlfriend too and that was a little harder to call. It comes down to both of them having to pay a price for their love and the various tests of their willingness to do so. Even at the end it was a bit uncertain as such a romance would probably be. You can almost see them trying to decide if this is worth the trouble they are going through or just a lust thing they will eventually get over.The characters are likable even when you don't agree with them. The father who doesn't want his son going out with a Catholic girl is not only likable you can even see his point of view and the quandary he is in. The story line is believable especially today and the sub plots were intriguing.I'm not normally much for romance films unless there are a lot of naked chicks wobbling around or the popcorn is really good but I liked this movie quite a bit. Something in it appeals to even a die hard chick flick hater like me. It would make an excellent date movie giving you something to discuss while providing that all important element of romance that leads to your hand sliding off the gear shift and squeezing her thigh while you make some pseudointellectual point about one of the various issues in the film.There is no feelgood Hollywood ending here it just sort of fades out leaving you wondering what would happen with such a couple. Did they stay together? Did the boy reconcile with his family? But you don't feel cheated out of an ending rather you are forced to confront how you the viewer would deal with the same or similar issues.".

	schema:headline " Starcrossed lovers with authentic accents";
	schema:reviewBody "Ken Loach's very touching realistic A Fond Kiss actually Ae Fond Kiss it's a phrase from a Robert Burns poem is a Glasgow starcrossed lovers story. A blonde lady called Roisin Eva Birthistle teaches music in a statesupported Catholic school. She and Casim Atta Yaqub meet and fall in love. Casim grew up in Glasgow but has Pakistani Moslem parents. He breaks out of an arranged marriage and lives with Roisin. For living out of wedlock Roisin's moved out of the Catholic school where she's a favorite of students before end of term. Casim's family uses every wile to lure him back to the arranged marriage but he and Roisin stay together and say a gently ironic pledge of loyalty to each other. They know and we know it's not going to be easy.A little roughhewn like its Glasgow environment A Fond Kiss is simple and sincere. The principles are nonactors. In the wake of Mike Leigh's polished little gem Vera Drake we're aware of the rawness of this effort but it has a freshness and emotional validity Leigh's techniques sometimes lose. There's a surprising amount of flesh in Casim's and Roisin's encounters Loach may be socially conscious but he isn't averse to being sexy. There's not the wit and the sophistication of the 1985 FrearsKureishi collaboration My Beautiful Laundrette which still stands as perhaps the classic British crosscultural love story and also one of the most novelistically complex films in English of the past two decades.Maybe A Fond Kiss has its emotional impact for just that reason it sticks firmly to the saga of Casim and Roisin all external events and characters are seen exclusively in relation to them though the emotional pain felt by Casim's parents at losing their son is vividly shown. Laundrette shone at treating a gay love story within the context of other straight experiences such as the world weary gloom of Omar's Papa and the burgeoning capitalism of other relations. Loach's film has a thicker patina of authenticity the Glaswegian accents are sometimes nearimpenetrable and you can follow better when the Pakistanis are talking in Urdu with subtitles. It's an essential point that Casim's English is as Glaswegian as Roisin's and a slicker actor couldn't have achieved that.The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw noted an unfashionable streak of optimism running thorough A Fond Kiss while Philip French spoke of an unusually romantic and nonpolitical mode. True on both counts but nonpolitical doesn't mean the social aspects of the situation aren't deftly and completely outlined for us. A BBC critic called Kiss believable intelligent filmmaking but quibbled that considering the makers' pedigree Ae Fond Kiss... is more of a peck than a smacker. US critics have given the film a fair rating noting its cultural balance but with reservations about the technical competence of the piece. All this is a bit unfair because roughness has its virtues as polish has its faults. This is one of Loach's sunniest most moving efforts it's a shame that due to limited release it won't be seen by more of the US public.Shown at the Quad Cinema in New York in early December 2004.".

For living out of wedlock Roisin's moved out of the Catholic school where she's a favorite of students before end of term. Casim's family uses every wile to lure him back to the arranged marriage but he and Roisin stay together and say a gently ironic pledge of loyalty to each other. They know and we know it's not going to be easy.A little roughhewn like its Glasgow environment A Fond Kiss is simple and sincere. The principles are nonactors. In the wake of Mike Leigh's polished little gem Vera Drake we're aware of the rawness of this effort but it has a freshness and emotional validity Leigh's techniques sometimes lose. There's a surprising amount of flesh in Casim's and Roisin's encounters Loach may be socially conscious but he isn't averse to being sexy. There's not the wit and the sophistication of the 1985 FrearsKureishi collaboration My Beautiful Laundrette which still stands as perhaps the classic British crosscultural love story and also one of the most novelistically complex films in English of the past two decades.Maybe A Fond Kiss has its emotional impact for just that reason it sticks firmly to the saga of Casim and Roisin all external events and characters are seen exclusively in relation to them though the emotional pain felt by Casim's parents at losing their son is vividly shown. Laundrette shone at treating a gay love story within the context of other straight experiences such as the world weary gloom of Omar's Papa and the burgeoning capitalism of other relations. Loach's film has a thicker patina of authenticity the Glaswegian accents are sometimes nearimpenetrable and you can follow better when the Pakistanis are talking in Urdu with subtitles. It's an essential point that Casim's English is as Glaswegian as Roisin's and a slicker actor couldn't have achieved that.The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw noted an unfashionable streak of optimism running thorough A Fond Kiss while Philip French spoke of an unusually romantic and nonpolitical mode. True on both counts but nonpolitical doesn't mean the social aspects of the situation aren't deftly and completely outlined for us. A BBC critic called Kiss believable intelligent filmmaking but quibbled that considering the makers' pedigree Ae Fond Kiss... is more of a peck than a smacker. US critics have given the film a fair rating noting its cultural balance but with reservations about the technical competence of the piece. All this is a bit unfair because roughness has its virtues as polish has its faults. This is one of Loach's sunniest most moving efforts it's a shame that due to limited release it won't be seen by more of the US public.Shown at the Quad Cinema in New York in early December 2004.";

Still I respect him for taking up subject matters other directors avoid nowadays  most of all British working class stories. Ae fond kiss to me is his masterpiece. It's the first film I've seen that really brings across all the complexities of intercultural relationships. It resists the temptation to judge or mock the conservative islamic family while making clear that its sympathies are with the bicultural couple. It doesn't give any easy answers but shows that sometimes you can only choose between bad and worse  but choose you must if you still want to be able to look at yourself in the mirror. A friend of mine is Afghan and the film reminded me a lot of the problems she is going through balancing between family tradition and Western culture. So if you're interested in a deep aching but also hopeful look into the intercultural reality of our European societies go and see Ae fond kiss. Its Berlin awards are well deserved.".

She does not seem to draw any strength from faith but lives in a rather selfcentered manner. The introduction of the sectarian fanaticism of the parish priest was interesting because the Catholics in Britain are themselves and were even more so in the past a rather closeknit community similarly to the Pakistanis and Muslims in the country.Some reviewers here seemed not to have understood what the priest's problem was with her  it was not so much that she was unmarried living with a man but that she was in the eyes of the Church still married to her exhusband but lived with another man thus in adultery. It seems a bit mysterious to me why she hadn't applied for annulment herself as is suggested by the priest sometimes also called divorce Catholic style.

But let me ask you do we have such a movie made by a Hollywood directors or producers? Why not? The civil right movements is 40 years ago isn't it? This is a honest and simple film telling the love story of a young Muslim Pakistani raised in Glasgow and a young Irish teacher a splendid performance by ms Birthistle. It is taken from a daily live with recognizable stereotype of cultural status quo of the second generations immigrants in Europe. Maybe to the disappointment of some ppl Ken Loach's approach was classic. And political correct . But it is done without any cheap sentiments. The audience was left with an awkward feeling and the knowledge that their lives aren't going to be easy. You can consider it as a statement. But IMO such a statement is necessary so long there are ignorance and disrespect. This has been shamefully demonstrated by the late controversial Dutch mediocre director van Gogh in his last film before he was killed.While a love story between two human being should be a nonissue and to much of a movie screenplay this one is not. The tensions between Casim and Roisin between Casim and his parents and between Tahara and the rest of the family concerning her study in Edinbrough are pretty much there. The portrayal of the family meeting where the eldest sister were arranged to meet a young man and her parent in laws were striking.I feel sorry with the socalled liberal Hollywood bunch where they do not dare to pick interracial love story which unfortunately still an issue there. I remember the Pelican Brief where Denzel Washington has to restrain himself not to kiss Julia Robert. Hypocritical.I have a dream that I will one day live in a world where people will not be judged by the color of their skin their religion or their cultural background but by the content of their character as human being. 910".

Dealing with generation gaps between parents and children it also puts the Muslim beliefs in a slightly different limelight where destiny is not so much determined by faith but by family principles. A great set up has the audience warm up to the film's characters very effectivally and engages us into the story right off the bat. The acting is powerful and the theme never is 'preached' to us. The director does a fantastic job pulling us in to a world which might be far away from our own beliefs and lifestyles but has us all look beyond the apparent differences to see the true value of love. The theme and characters might not speak to everyone but undoubtfully it is a great piece of film making.".

Zhang's Hero was panned by a lot of Chinese film critics and HOFD has been the target of several withering attacks as well by man on the street as well as film critic. There are some nuances to the film that only Chinese viewers can appreciatesuch as the dialogue which in translation might seem perfectly reasonable but which makes Chinese people laugh. We've seen enough costume dramas and period pieces and have good enough sense of our history to know what is believable and what is not. The way they wrote the dialogue which is literary Chinese but not quite came off just hokey especially when coming out of the mouths of Kaneshiro and Andy Lau. It's not just their mandarin is not what we are used to but perhaps because in our minds they are part of pop culture and thus you get some of the Keanu reeves doing Shakespeare kind of effect. It just falls short.And this is not to mention how unbelievable the love story is. I can't fathom why people consider this topnotch acting. The most popular actors are not necessarily the best actorsthere are plenty of underrated Chinese character actors out there that could have burned a hole through any of these roles. Somehow some people believe that just because set up the right premiseslove honor loyalty etc etc that will you automatically achieve something profound. Chinese people love martial arts and wuxia novels to be sure but many of the people I talked to found Zhang Ziyi's xiao mei character dying and then seemingly reviving to be just silly. I would argue that in a movie that is patently a fantasy movie of sorts that you have to be fair and suspend disbelief and they do say that she never pulled out the dagger in her heart which is why she could stay alive long enough to utter some more hokum.I also agree with others that a final showdown between the House of Flying Daggers and the government police would have provided more of a sense of closure for the audience. I say this because whenever you have a premise like the end of a Chinese dynasty outlaw groups attempting the overthrow of the government you've got a great set up for a story especially it is precisely the end of eras and beginning of new eras dynasties which capture the Chinese imagination. In the chaos of a crumbling order men are men both the best of heroes and worst of villains is likely to appear. The bonds that tie human beings together are strained put through the crucible of a cruel death for being on the wrong side.Which is why it would have been nice if this so called romance or love story could have embedded in the larger framework of a story of the battle between the mysterious House of Flying Daggers and the remnants of the tang Dynasty.one more note the whole spy double double crossing thing is getting kind of old considering infernal affairs and all the other new cop movies coming out of Hong Kong. I see that cinematic ally there are always more CG effects to use to bring us into the wuxia world...but intellectually HOFD shows that these mainstream Chinese films have already pumped the well entirely dry.".

The way they wrote the dialogue which is literary Chinese but not quite came off just hokey especially when coming out of the mouths of Kaneshiro and Andy Lau. It's not just their mandarin is not what we are used to but perhaps because in our minds they are part of pop culture and thus you get some of the Keanu reeves doing Shakespeare kind of effect. It just falls short.And this is not to mention how unbelievable the love story is. I can't fathom why people consider this topnotch acting. The most popular actors are not necessarily the best actorsthere are plenty of underrated Chinese character actors out there that could have burned a hole through any of these roles. Somehow some people believe that just because set up the right premiseslove honor loyalty etc etc that will you automatically achieve something profound. Chinese people love martial arts and wuxia novels to be sure but many of the people I talked to found Zhang Ziyi's xiao mei character dying and then seemingly reviving to be just silly. I would argue that in a movie that is patently a fantasy movie of sorts that you have to be fair and suspend disbelief and they do say that she never pulled out the dagger in her heart which is why she could stay alive long enough to utter some more hokum.I also agree with others that a final showdown between the House of Flying Daggers and the government police would have provided more of a sense of closure for the audience. I say this because whenever you have a premise like the end of a Chinese dynasty outlaw groups attempting the overthrow of the government you've got a great set up for a story especially it is precisely the end of eras and beginning of new eras dynasties which capture the Chinese imagination. In the chaos of a crumbling order men are men both the best of heroes and worst of villains is likely to appear. The bonds that tie human beings together are strained put through the crucible of a cruel death for being on the wrong side.Which is why it would have been nice if this so called romance or love story could have embedded in the larger framework of a story of the battle between the mysterious House of Flying Daggers and the remnants of the tang Dynasty.one more note the whole spy double double crossing thing is getting kind of old considering infernal affairs and all the other new cop movies coming out of Hong Kong. I see that cinematic ally there are always more CG effects to use to bring us into the wuxia world...but intellectually HOFD shows that these mainstream Chinese films have already pumped the well entirely dry.";

	schema:reviewBody "After absolutely loving 'Hero' I couldn't wait for Zhang Yimou's latest Wuxia Pien feature to arrive on DVD. After watching it I'm happy to say I wasn't disappointed as it is another sumptuous stylistic feature which deserves all the accolades it is likely to receive.The plot of the film is told in a more linear narrative when compared to that of 'Hero' but that is not to say it is any more straightforward. Set in the Tang Dynasty the basic premise is nothing to write home about featuring government officials on the trail of an underground rebel alliance 'The House of Flying Daggers'. However there is enough characterisation and depth to hold your attention while the sometimes predictable plot twists keep you guessing. Unfortunately there is nothing entirely new about this story and it's probably familiar ground to fans of the wuxia genre. Nevertheless it flows at a decent pace and is punctuated with enough stylistic action sequences that the 2hour running time is quickly exhausted.As with Yimou's impressive previous feature Tony Ching Siutung takes over the action direction producing another sterling performance. In my opinion he is currently the top fight choreographer around after spending so many years being considered second fiddle to the likes of Yuen Woping and Sammo Hung he now deserves to be considered above them on his current output. In this instance much of the overt stylisation evident in Hero is played down in favour of more grounded natural martial artistry. There is still plenty of wire work and a spattering of CGI to aid the sequences however it is plain to see that much of the action displayed is a mix of genuine swordplay and actual technique. All the performers acquit themselves well considering none of them are formally trained in martial arts  especially Zhang Ziyi who performs impressively from start to finish.As you would expect from a Zhang Yimou film the visuals are majestic with primary colours and panoramic landscapes making up much of what we see. Unfortunately many people do not seem to take to this artistic approach and will label the film another case of style over substance. I would disagree as I believe it contains plenty of both with a strong cast interesting characters and high quality action to provide the foundation for the kind of bold sumptuous visuals which are rare to find in modern film.Overall I personally prefer 'Hero' but know of plenty who would disagree. As a result I recommend it as a definite purchase to any fan of films from this genre.".

Xiaoding Zhao's elegant cinematography imbues every scene with haunting beauty. Think Tak Fujimoto times ten with no disrespect meant to Fujimoto who shoots Western movies and still manages to inject his refined visual sense into such great films as Silence of the Lambs and Sixth Sense.Director Yimou Zhang's work in Hero was more epic more heroic but SMMF has a more refined sense of story. The cast the scenery the music including vocal performances by the legendary Kathleen Battle all elements conspire brilliantly to convey subtle and nuanced meaning in moments. The story as do all good stories of this genre revolves around a delicate interplay of love betrayal deception and heroism of many different kinds and oh yes those stunning ballets of combat layered with evocative sounds and effects.In a nutshell the plot goes something like this. A beautiful blind showgirl is captured as a spy. Her captors conspire to trick her into leading them to her leader. Along the way both hunter and quarry become entangled in a web of subterfuge and deception. Add in a beautifully tragic romantic story line again as all such movies must have and never forget that the essence of all truly great tragedy is inevitability.This movie is also known as Ambush From Ten Sides and in that more literal translation of its title you will find its essence. A worthy successor to Hero though not as magnificent as Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon in which Ziyi Zhang gives the performance of a lifetime and the one against all her other roles will be judged and in this case fall short House of Flying Daggars is nevertheless a feast for the senses and a fully satisfying cinematic experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "Zhang Yimou set a new benchmark for martial arts movies with Hero. Visually both inventive and dazzling whilst having a strong thematic thread it still managed to kick ass with energetic fight sequences. He continues in the same vein with House of Flying Daggers with love and romance replacing Hero's chivalry and honour. It is at times as blisteringly exciting and exquisite to view but there are a few problems.Set in a similar time to Hero the plot revolves around the mysterious House of Flying Daggers a group of assassins leading a rebellion of sorts against the rulers of their land. News has reached the local military captain Leo Andy Lau that the leader of the House can be found plying their trade in the local brothel. Sensing that this could be the key to ending their resistance he sends one of his men Jin Takeshi Kaneshiro to infiltrate the establishment posing as a customer. This soon leads him to the beautiful blind dancer Mei Zhang Ziyi who may just be the daughter of the assassinated former leader of the House. What follows is his journey with edit her through forests and meadows as he vies to gain her trust all the while intent on leading the army to their destination in an attempt to discover the leader of the House.The plot is actually far more complicated than my short synopsis could come close to. We are treated to a twisty turny adventure punctuated with set pieces of excuse the tired terminology balletic grace. Yimou sets a number of scenes within symmetrically perfect backgrounds the picture set up like a work of art. We find ourselves in a dance hall encircled with drums where the camera moves with a sense of fluidity as though part of the dance as we see Mei play a game of echoes with the Captain. Each time he hits a drum with a flicked nut she follows striking it with her flowing robes. The scene has a steady tempo finally hitting a crescendo as the whole bowl is flung nuts flying everywhere like missiles striking every drum. The sound of each strike reverberates like thunder.For me the other set pieces never quite match the echo dance for majesty rhythm or look. We get to see numerous showdowns between with Mei and Jin taking on the soldiers that chase them all the while with Jin trying to maintain his cover. The fights very much feel like a dance and are filled with POV shots of arrows sharpened bits of wood and of course flying daggers. I thought this camera trick felt overused it looks good but eventually started to feel tired as yet another dagger is seen boomeranging into action.As events reach a climax the plot gets pretty messy as revelation after revelation is thrown about. In contrast to Hero's coda where the action became about what's doing right for the good of the whole country House of Flying Daggers has one of a more personal nature. It never quite rings true there just isn't the emotion on display for this to work. The final act is somewhat botched with a it's over no it isn't feel to it which caused a few no ways to be uttered in my vicinity. It is yet another gloriously shot scene but we'd already seen some extraordinary moments. I felt it seemed to be reaching a more natural conclusion and with a bit of editing a tighter last half hour would've made this a classic.As it stands House of Flying Daggers is a fine movie never quite as good as Hero and probably behind Crouching Tiger too and maybe it goes on a bit too long but it's far superior to most of the formulaic actioners Hollywood produces. Out of ten I'd give it an eight.".

Murder revenge love betrayal  these are all tired bywords that bounce off a potential moviegoers brain when we see them in advertisements. If that's your response too this time I urge you to ignore it because final score notwithstanding there is so much to be savoured and enjoyed in just looking at the screen. Zhang Yimou once a photographer and cinematographer himself has an exquisite eye. Colour is a recurring feature of his films with a life and story of it's own to tell and this film is textured almost to the point of gluttony. To call it breathtaking is not overstating it. But unlike the deliberate stylisation of Hero the settings here are much earthier. You can feel each flower and blade of grass and marvel at the vivid detail in the costumes. It's wildly sensuous on a visual level. The drama as we have seen from Zhang before is heightened by the moodiness of the weather and emotions are expressed through the changing of seasons. The combat sequences are inventively executed giving the violence an uneasy beauty. As is often the case in this genre the fights might astound you with the precision and power of the choreography but they keep you at a distance from the pain and injury. Not so in the final showdown between the characters Jin Takeshi Kaneshiro and Leo Andy Lau Tak Wah. This is a man's fight brutal bloody messy and decidedly ungraceful. When Leo raises his sword to kill Jin he means it. His anger is so ferocious that it can only be represented by a drastic change in season. Mid fight Autumn becomes Winter showing that the friendship these men once had has gone irreparably from cool tolerance to icy implacable fury. It is a feature of the novels from which many of these stories are taken that the martial arts skill of the protagonists is so great they are actually able to harness the power of the elements to use to their own advantage. This may or may not be the case here noone benefits from the snow and sleet for all as Shakespeare once put it are punished.However when the melodrama hits the rhapsody is seriously tainted. In any movie some suspension of disbelief is a given but when it's suspended over a gaping chest wound and under three feet of snow and it's already hanging by the thinnest of threads it becomes comical instead of dramatic. My friend and me both wailed with disbelief every time Mei Zhang Ziyi was resurrected towards the end Don't tell me she's getting up AGAIN!??. Had she died the first time she was stabbed and actually stayed dead the effectiveness of the movie would have been increased by 90. Unfortunately some of the high marks earned were lost by the stupidity of this plotpoint.Further the dialogue at key moments was just cheesy and embarrassing. I thought perhaps it was a translation problem but my friend who is from Mainland China assured me it was in equally poor taste in Mandarin. Such a pity because it could've been salvaged by some ruthless script doctoring.First two thirds 710 Last third 310 Score out of 10  5.5 but I'll round it up to 6.As an aside Andy Lau's Mandarin was an achievement in itself. I understand it was dubbed later to achieve the maximum correct pronunciation but at least it was dubbed by him and not another actor. After watching around half of his hundred or so movies all in Cantonese it was a great pleasure to see him take on the task and do so well. My friend would not believe it was him it was so good.".

I can't count the number of times I have completely forgotten that I've actually got my own physical form while watching films like House of Flying Daggers but I can count how many times that's happened during Western films zero.For those of you who have no taste I beg you but aside your views on gravitydefying fight scenes and subtitles. Just remember that this is something called FANTASY. It isn't real no matter how much you wish it to be. It's called cinema you can do whatever the hell you like in film. I don't complain when you've got aliens that spurt out your chest. I don't complain when the dead rise from their graves. I don't complain about the lack of reason behind the ideas that aliens would have less intelligence than humans or that the living dead would harbour grudges against the really living. I complain when it just looks simply uninspiring and frankly visually boring.So Zhang Yimou please bring on more heroes and flying daggers".

	onyx:emotionText "I have never ever seen a film that the West has ever created that can top Chinese cinema in this form with the exception possibly being Lord of the Rings. I truly applaud Oriental taste. I can't count the number of times I have completely forgotten that I've actually got my own physical form while watching films like House of Flying Daggers but I can count how many times that's happened during Western films zero.For those of you who have no taste I beg you but aside your views on gravitydefying fight scenes and subtitles. Just remember that this is something called FANTASY. It isn't real no matter how much you wish it to be. It's called cinema you can do whatever the hell you like in film. I don't complain when you've got aliens that spurt out your chest. I don't complain when the dead rise from their graves. I don't complain about the lack of reason behind the ideas that aliens would have less intelligence than humans or that the living dead would harbour grudges against the really living. I complain when it just looks simply uninspiring and frankly visually boring.So Zhang Yimou please bring on more heroes and flying daggers";

I am stunned by how positive most reviews seem to be.There were some gorgeous shots but it's too bad they were wasted on this sinkhole of a movie. It might have worked if Daggers was purely an action flick and not a romance but unfortunately the film is built around an empty love triangle. There is no chemistry between either of the couples whatever exists between Mei and her men seems to be more lust than love and for the most part the dialogue is just silly. This may be just a problem with translation but the frequent usage of the word flirt in particular reminded me of 8th grade not headoverheels together forever worthdyingfor love I also felt we were beat over the head with the wind metaphor. The audience is given very little about the characters to really care about and therefore very little emotional investment in the movie as a whole. I was wishing for a remote control to fast forward I was slumped in my seat ready to snore but mostly I just cringed a lot.spoilerNow the icing on the cake. Or rather adding insult to injury. The ending was truly one of the most horrible laughable ones I have ever seen. The boys are having their stag fight and screaming and yelling and hacking at each other. Oh and then it starts to snow. Randomly. Oh and then Mei dagger embedded in heart suddenly pops up out of the weeds. Then she throws a dagger that seems to take about 5 minutes to reach it's destination even slowing conveniently midscreen to hit a tiny blood droplet. Wow cool.Well then Mei dies finally I guess because she threw the dagger that was lodged in her chest and bled to death. Jin sings sobs holds her body close screen goes blank. I and the people surrounding me are chuckling. Not a good sign.Visually stunning but ultimately a failure.".

	schema:reviewBody "House of Flying Daggers Shi mian mai fu shows they can make movies like that anymore. This is a grand action love story that fully captures the eye and the heart the pulse and ears. Yes an action flick can be a date movie! While building on the WuXia tradition of literature and film that's as much historical fantasy as any rollicking Dumas adventure or the Lord of the Rings films director Yimou Zhang incorporates elements we have seen elsewhere into a freshly thrilling experience. Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon had a more sophisticated plot but this one's twisty enough in the ever more duplicitous spieshunter and the hunted vein. It has a lot of plot similarities to another Ziyi Zhangstarrer the drama of 1930's war intrigue Purple Butterfly Zi hudie minus the political lessons. From Japanese films there's borrowing from the Zatichi The Blind Swordsman legends as well as almost as much from Kurasawa's Hidden Fortress that Lucas did for the Star Wars saga and then borrowing forest fighting imagery from Lucas to an open meadow as magical as in The Wizard of Oz. The Matrix movies may have wowed us more with bullet time plus there is a lot of following arrow trajectories as in Robin Hood Prince of Thieves not coincidentally as the titular rebels are stealing from the rich to benefit the poor but the context of the weapons for SiuTung Ching's martial arts choreography are more varied and emotional. Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge is only a bit more over the top than the beautiful production design and elaborate costumes in this Peony Pavilion but every inch of the screen and soundtrack is as operatically filled and should be experienced on a large screen. The director's own Hero Ying xiong is more beautiful as this is missing cinematographer Christopher Doyle's aesthetics but Xiaoding Zhao's cinematographical debut captures a breathtaking variety of landscapes in straightforward storytelling. The sound design is as important with lots of heavy breathing from tension and exertion. While it's a much smaller cast than sweeping epics like Dr. Zhivago Titanic or Gone With the Wind it has that swept away feel of a love story amidst larger forces even if for much of the movie its the force of nature of the geography of Ukraine and a bamboo forest national park which forcefully reminded me of an elementary school unit my son's class did on how bamboo is stronger than steel. Warriors of Heaven and Earth Tian di ying xiong showed that spectacular scenery can be a backdrop for a pedestrian movie. But like Hero the enormous canvas is background for zooming in on three enormously charismatic actors in a passionate and unexpectedly tricky love triangle.Ziyi Zhang needs to watch someone other than Mary Pickford especially some Susan Sarandon or Jeanne Moreau to learn that there's more levels in projecting romance than smoldering ratcheting right up to jump his bones but one has to make some allowances as this is the first as sexy as this Chinese movie and the romance does recall preCode Hollywood. Her beautiful shoulders are used quite provocatively.Takeshi Kaneshiro is ravishingly captivating but Andy Lau gives him a run for your heart in surprises that revolve around the unusual plot point of a woman's willingness being paramount which is refreshing and adds suspense and emotion to the story. The closing Kathleen Battle song is a bit over the top as the music throughout verges on schmaltzy as it shamelessly reinforces what you see and hear but you are left gasping if not weeping at the end anyway.".

	schema:reviewBody "Treading merrily along the path of Hollywoodization pardon my expression started in Ying Xiong director Zhang Yimou turned out another equally meticulously crafted product Shi Mian Mai Fu which was showcased to the world in the 2004 Cannes 'out of competition' category.Meticulously crafted SMMF starts by giving the audience an exceptional feast of the ear putting them in a blind person's POV or maybe I should say POH 'H' for hearing. The duel of drums scene is brilliant. As if that is not enough we are treated to another feast of sounds this time the thundering hoofs and clashing weapon in the pursuit and attack of the blind girl.Even more meticulously crafted is the color display. A topnotch cinematographer Yellow Earth 1984 before a director Zhang does not appear to be able to tolerate anything that falls short of atheistic perfection. Although not as blatantly as in Ying Xiong he exhibits here a color display that is equally dazzling. The landscape in the first couple of scenes is in mellowed brown yellow and pale green. Then come the lush green hills and the dreamy world of the bamboo forest. Towards the end we have a white birth forest and for no apparent reason are given a frame of only two seconds of a fiery stretch of fall colors. In the finale the ominous dark clouds eventually produce a winter wonderland to receive profuse splashes of crimson blood.Crafted sight and sound is great but overcrafted script and story is where SMMF falls down. In the show that I attended the audience burst out in a clearly audible expression of mirth where none was intended by the script. I do recognize that this was due in part to the fact that they know Andy Lau too well. But then some of the things were thrust at the audience so abruptly that I think their reaction is forgivable.In a nutshell Flying Dagger is no Crouching Tiger as Zhang Yimou lacks the heart soul and sensitivity of Ang Lee. I remember watching a TV interview of Zhang a couple of years ago when he intimated something to the effect that making movie is a marketdriven affair and if the global market wants it he'll make it. Well he is at least honest about the whole thing and he did make Ying Xiong. But I do miss director Zhang's earlier work Red Sorghum Raise the Red Lantern Qiu Ju Goes to Court Living Not One Less My Father and Mother.One final point of no particular consequence. Shi Mian Mai Fu literal translation 'Ambushed on Ten Sides' is the best known piece of music for the lutelike pipa. I notice that three or four bars from the piece are featured in the background music at the point when the blind girl's true identity is revealed.Thank goodness it didn't get the Golden Globe....would have been SUCH an embarrassment if it did.".

	schema:headline " The reverse of the Hero philosophy? Very entertaining but flawed";
	schema:reviewBody "The film has the problem of following on the heels of Hero of course. Still whereas Hero took Zhang a good 6 years to write and cast it into its final form this was not the case here. So it's obvious that this was in no way meant as deliberately as Hero to be as huge an artistic statement. And why should it. A film's merit is seldom measured uniquely by its artistic merit fortunately. But more is lacking. I'll keep it short and sum it up does contain SPOILERS about the ending!. Sorry about the length.1 The story is the reverse of Hero in a way. In Hero the whole point was that the individual's want pales in the light of the Big Plan an entirely eastern premise. In this one it's the western romantic tradition of the individual's desires being more important than the Cause they both betray their Cause. In other words it's your classical Romeo  Juliet  Tristan  Iseult kinda thing. This is mirrored in the way the story is told  in this one the historic backdrop though suggested to be important by the opening text is of no importance whatsoever. The problem is he doesn't pull it off without problems  why? Well2 The lovestory's thin. Despite the classical but rather wellplaced twists in the overall intrigue the lovers do little more than going back and forth. First he wants her she does not let him then she wants him but he does not let her and leaves then he returns to find out he cannot have her. Than it becomes clear that in fact he can because she does want him... all wellfit in the overarching story but still too much. So finally IT happens and they part then she goes back he goes back all only to end in tragedy see 4. You get it there's a whole lot going on just to make the one point the love each other. Why? because there wasn't much other script material? because the actors couldn't pull off more depth? I don't know.3 The cinematography is great but a not as stunning as in Hero plus most of it is filmed in Ukraine not China! and b he's showing off! Something I cannot stand. I mean the first half hour serves to show us what an absolutely stunning filmmaker we got here. He begins at the top instead of slowly building magnificent scene on magnificent scene as in Hero. So whereas in Hero I slowly became aware that I was watching stuff that would get stuck in my mind forever here during the first 30' I was thinking come on mate I know you're good get started on the story. Although if I were him I would be tempted as well to point my camera at Ziyi Zhang and hold it there...4 The inconsequences! It's cool to have twists and lead the public on but don't take them for fools! I don't care about impossible stuff but keep the internal logic. Why if they knew each other do Andy Lau and Ziyi Zhang have such a terrible fight at the arrest. I can understand the drum thing  they wanted to have some fun and he had to 'prove' her 'guilty'  but why the dimmak pressurepoint stuff and subsequent drowning when there's just the two of them? Other example might be the subs why do the supposed Flying Daggers leader and Andy Lau keep up the game when they're out of the hut's reach? If he's one of them why does she ask him do you have anything to say? and why does he answer you're not the real leader  If he's a FD guy this is obvious! There's others...5 Now the end. It's like a Tchaikovsky symphony  the bleedin' thing just doesn't end! I thought the film was still very strong when Ziyi gets struck by Lau's dagger. But then it comes  she 'dies' no less than four 4! times. I mean come on! I know the idea of only being dead when you pull the weapon OUT is commonplace in the east so I can live with the idea that a dagger in the heart doesn't kill her but the characters themselves shouldn't be surprised! Furthermore the reasons why she 'revives' are three times IDENTICAL i.e. to prove her love for him something she already proved abundantly and to which one last illustration would have sufficed. But no  the first time she regains life it's to warn her lover. The second time it's to defend him a the cost of her life and the last time she reopens her eyes the audience was already laughing at that point it's again to say something she's said several times before. The movie would have benefited from just the fight and then as an apotheosis the one resurrection where she pulls out the dagger a powerful moment in itself. Same comment for the numerous times the One Tear is shed... The number of One Tearshots ToandFro's see 1 and Dying Moments made it seem like I was watching one beautiful point being made over and over again like I was a romantic illiterate.Plus I might me really picking here but I thought the fight sequences were nowhere near as impressive as the ones in Hero. Especially Takeshi Kaneshiro's fighting in the final confrontation lacked a lot.This being said though the film won't stick like Hero basically because the cinematography and story are not as impressive or well done it's a feast for the eye. And if you numb your mind you might get something out of it. If not the necessary romantic beingrippedapart feeling than at least bewildered astonishment in front of the costumes and the nothing less than otherworldly almost impossible to endure beauty of Ziyi Zhang.Favourite moment Zhang Ziyi's split between two bamboo trees.".

	schema:reviewBody "After just 15 minutes into this film I began to miss Zhang Yimou's earlier more weighty films that looked at the politics and society of China from unique perspectives. His turn to martial arts films was a serious misstep in my humble opinion. Hero was his worst film since Operation Cougar with a needlessly complex story and acting more wooden than that found in a John Agar film. Shi Mian Mai Fu is no different. As an American who has been studying Chinese films for a few years now and understands and can speak some Mandarin I'm sure my opinion is different from many others as I'm coming from a different background. SMMF like Hero is not really a traditional a kung fu film and it's certainly not a wuxia pian film. There are no sword  sorcery or chivalry elements here. This is a completely different vehicle than infinitely more watchable films such as A Chinese Ghost Story all 3 The Butterfly Murders Green Snake et al. While those all featured charismatic leads who looked like they were actually enjoying what they do SMMF features bland and sometimes laughable dialogue combined with cardboard acting. Zhang Ziyi plays a blind person about as well as Ben Affleck. There's an air of superiority with this film that's really quite insulting. It takes itself so seriously it just becomes a huge joke by the end. All the actors look as though this is the most important piece of celluloid in history they destroy any chance of actually conveying emotions and the complete humorlessness of it really makes you wonder if Zhang Yimou was making a film per se or simply a showcase i.e. an ego booster for Zhang Ziyi. The camera is literally making out with her face and she gets sexually assaulted not once but twice in the film. Her acting range really hasn't extended past her ability to play a naive witch. She's so concentrated on her acting she comes across as cold and lifeless as though she's reading her lines from a notecard. It's so funny to hear American critics and film people like the completely clueless Quentin Tarantino call this film a masterpiece. I guess if they see a bunch of Asian actors on screen looking really important while flying through a bamboo forest they're tricked into thinking it's brilliant filmmaking. Ching Siu Tung's choreography while still retaining his trademark style editing and postures lacks the vitality and originality of his earlier films like A Chinese Ghost Story Dragon Inn and Duel to the Death. Sadly to say the wirework in this film is really subpar and if there's subparobvious wirework then you probably shouldn't have filmed it at high speed. The same goes for the special effects which have a distinct Bmovie feel to them. Beans daggers bowls arrows swords and other random objects fly through the air after being thrown with no regard for logic turning climbing and banking as though there's a little pilot inside. I know that logic doesn't really hold a place in stylized Chinese martial arts films but if you don't want to induce a mass amount of giggling from your audience then you should probably work on your compositing a bit more. Mass melodrama unintentionally funny dramatic moments boring fight scenes really uninspired plot twists are what await you with Shi Mian Mai Fu. It's obvious that Zhang Yimou is no longer making movies for Chinese audiences. This is meant to crack into the Western market just as CTHD did. After watching Hero and SMMF I've come to the conclusion that if Zhang Yimou wants to make Hollywood films he's definitely off to the right start. SMMF is basically The Phantom Menace of Chinese martial arts films. And I thought Hero was bad.".

With a text very similar to the one above the story about his great movie begins. We have beautiful scenariosclothestextures and make up everything very colorful and bright. The three lead characters are captain Leo captain Jin and the blind girl called Mei who is a dancer in an entertainment house and also a suspect of working for the Flying Daggers's clan. One of the best part of this movie is when Mei is dancing for Jin...everything was so beautiful and Zhang Zyiy was astonishing as Takeshi Kaneshiro who is the most beautiful Asian actor I already saw in my life!";

Looking around the lecture theatre I could see nearly everyone engrossed in the movie and a fair few ready to cry like they never had before. 'To Live' was a rather critical attack on the Chinese Communist Party. Eight years later and apparently 'Hero' is his way of supporting the CCP. So that got me thinking is 'House of Flying Daggers' his way of pretending to be serious while he still figures out his own political beliefs?'House of Flying Daggers' comes to us as what appears to be appears another love story  wu xia  whatever hybrid made with western audiences in mind much like 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon' and 'Hero'. I am quite the fan of martial arts movies and enjoy a good wu xia movie my favourite being 'Iron Monkey' but I am a bit hesitant regarding these newer hybrid movies that take themselves too seriously. I love 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon' but I do not want to see a rapid succession of movies like 'House of Flying Daggers'.Towards the end of the Tang Dynasty a group of revolutionaries known as the House of Flying Daggers pose a threat to the declining Tang government. It isn't hard to figure out how these little rebels got their name thanks to a penchant for using the most gravity  nay reality  defying throwingdaggers you will ever see. Enter Mei Zhang Ziyi pretending to be DareDevil or at least the Master of the Flying Guillotine a blind dancer suspected of having links to the Flying Daggers. In an elaborate  and thoroughly confusing  scheme to infiltrate the Flying Daggers Police Captain Leo Andy Lau sends Jin Takeshi Kaneshiro to investigate Mei arrests them both and then lets Jin dress up as flying ninja because when you want something done you'd best ask a flying ninja to break Mei out of jail and lead the police to the Flying Daggers.Now normally in martialarts movies the plot is not important nor even essential compared to the action on screen. On the hand the plot of 'House of the Flying Daggers' is central to the film while the fights are not. The story is long occasionally boring and featuring that twists that range from the predictable to the just plain silly. But hey if you're looking for the longest death scene with no definite conclusion ever filmed then look no further than 'House of Flying Daggers'.The only thing about 'House of Flying Daggers' that is better than your average martial arts movie is the visuals. It is a stunning and beautiful movie but anyone watching 'House of Flying Daggers' for it's cinematography is going to have suspend disbelief to the extreme especially in scenes such as the obligatory bambooforest sequence.'House of Flying Daggers' beats most martialarts movies hands down with regard to cinematography. Unfortunately for 'House of Flying Daggers' there are plenty of martialarts films with a vastly inferior plot and cinematography but feature action scenes that blow this movie out of the water. There are some nice fights and it has the obligatory bambooforest scene you will find bambooforest scenes in nearly every movie or game remotely like this the 'Tenchu' videogame series being the first example to spring to mind which in this case was rather amusing. Most of the action suffers from going overboard on superCGI and I can't help shake the feeling that I saw the same dagger flying against a different background every time. In fact I think I did.As a wu xia kungfu movie 'House of Flying Daggers' isn't bad but it certainly isn't that good either. It gets pretty boring at times  510".

If I want to see dancing I will go to the ballet. The fighting whilst well choreographed lacked realism.

I thought the performances of all the actors were very good especially by Zhang Zhiyi. I have always admired actors who portray roles which are very unique and not normally done.The story was also pretty solid.

	schema:reviewBody "HOFD is difficult to simply dismiss outright as a bad movie only because Zhang Yimou is a master craftsman who is clearly present in the work. While calling it bad poses some difficulties it would be hard to understate the case for its ain'tgoodness for a film about which I knew literally nothing going in I haven't been this let down in a very long time.First and foremostand this represents a major break by Zhang with his previous workthe film isn't about anything. Whereas Hero was to paraphrase one of the HOFD reviewers exploring a profound theme in a very ambitious way HOFD is a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing. There are no underlying themes grand or modest to be found anywhere in its two hours. It's barely more than a series of random frequently tedious scenes thrown together. About an hour into the film you get a big reveal.1 Most movie goers will I suspect have seen it coming from only minutes into the filmI certainly didbut when it finally arrives you think you're about to see a major theme emerge having to do with identity. Everything has been heavyhandedly pointing toward it for a while. Unfortunately it's dropped immediately and permanently and a cloying soap opera introduced which is allowed to consume the rest of the film.It isn't even a good soap. To be effective a soap must be emotionally engaging on at least some level. In HOFD the film goes out of its way to be exactly the opposite. The structure of the film denies the viewer even the most basic knowledge necessary to have any feelings at all about the characters. Everyone is lying about who they are for most of the movie and when this is revealed the viewer is never offered anything to fall back on. You don't know who they are and can't feel any sympathy for them. Their very bad behavior after the big reveal makes this even worseby then you're actively disliking them and before the movie is over you just wish everyone would die. Further crippling this entire stretch of film is the Spielbergian structure adopted by the director which is constantly telling the viewer he's supposed to care about them.Then there are the setpieces. Hero was packed to the gills with fantastic setpieces during its running time you were faced on perhaps dozens of occasions with astonishingly original and beautiful images which floated around in your mind long after the movie was over. HOFD has much more action than Herothere seems to be an action sequence every three minutes or sobut it doesn't manage a single such image. Not one. The action sequences in fact were almost without exception blandly choreographed exercises in unbearable tedium. More than once during HOFD many donnybrooks my finger crept toward the FF button and at two different points I was unable to resist the temptation. In Hero the fights were highly stylized lots of wirework emotion closeups. It wasn't supposed to be realistic. It was like feelings. It was like a dance. It was like an opera. It was beautiful wuxia. In HOFD it's like a really silly cartoon full of awful awful awful CGIartist masturbation of the kind that have rendered Hollywood's summer blockbusters unwatchable. Every battle in HOFD sees scores of badlycomputergenerated arrows swords and daggers cut around corners and bounce off targets only to reset themselves in midair and try again. They behave in more ridiculous fashion than the JFK magic bullet and the movie exploits every visual clich in the book in displaying themfor what seems like hundreds of times you get the standard traveling shot following a CGI weapon in the foreground to its target. Hero had a few moments where fights were illconceived the chess parlor fight and the fight over the lake or dragged on a bit too long like the incredible fight in the autumnal forest. All of HOFD's fight sequences however looked like this.The conclusion of this mess is just awful in every possible way and is not in the least camouflaged by the inexplicable snowstorm Zhang threw in to try to confuse the matter. It's the sort of ending you tack on when there's no real point to anything you've just seen. There's no way to create a real ending because the film having told no story there's no story to play out. Throw in some more fighting and a sudden snowstorm and maybe no one will notice Zhang foolishly draws attention to the Flying Dagger plot he'd so abruptly abandoned for soap by tossing in a shot of the soldiers creeping up on Flying Dagger HQ near the endshould have let us forget about them Zhang!.In short HOFD looks exactly like what an upbudget Hollywood attempt to duplicate a film like Hero or Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon would look like. Its remarkably positive critical reception in the United States is a very damning comment on the state of contemporary film criticism. I don't deal in thumbs and don't like numerical ratings for films. I suppose one measure of a movie's impression is whether you find yourself looking at it again. I've seen Hero a few times nowI don't anticipate I'll ever been sitting down to HOFD again.1 The big reveal makes rubbish out of several things you've already seenthis one would hold up really badly on subsequent viewings when the viewer is aware of everyone's real agenda beforehand.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mann is in my honest opinion one of the best films of 1999. It is at first a very nice light romance which later turns into a sad and emotional drama. The story is very beautiful and is reminiscent of the 1965 classic 'Arzoo' the music is fantastic and the acting is very effective. Among the songs Khushiyan Aur Gham is one of my most favourite songs ever. Aamir Khan delivers an excellent performance. Although he is not very convincing as a womaniser he is very good as a suffering lover. I think the best thing about his acting at that point of time was his simplicity and restraint and that he never tried to do more than required as I said at least until that point of time. Manisha Koirala gives an amazing performance. She is intense compelling and moving as always and does not at any point try to victimise her character. The film's big tragic twist is a tough moment to see a moment which makes you realise how unexpected life can be and how important it is to cherish every moment of it. This is a wonderful and touching picture. I highly recommend.".

Perhaps other songs were copied as well.However all the elements even if they were copied fit together wonderfully. Perhaps they fit together even better because they combined so many extraordinary elements the story line of an American classic  Italian song and of course the emotions captured in Indian movies.Personally this movie really touched me more than any other.

The first half was enjoyable with a flare of comedy and the second half had a fair share of emotions which would keep your heart flowing with Dev and Priya till the last sceneand what a scene it was !!The  music by debutant duo SanjeevDarshan is one of the main highlights of Mann. They brought out some very interesting tunes which occupies your mind and it is worth of them to be listened repeatedly. All songs are infectious and melodious which are delivered by Udit Alka and Hema Serdasai  All at their best.

	schema:reviewBody "In the eighties John Duigan was one of Australia's most innovative and charming filmmakers. Although he hasn't done much of note in recent years Flirting 1991 and Lawn Dogs 1997 are 90s examples of his brilliance and his forthcoming film Head in the Clouds sounds promising. Lawn Dogs with its magnificent acting screenplay sadly not by Duigan and stunning cinematography is probably his masterpiece but for sheer experimentalism and surprising pathos One Night Stand is hard to ignore especially considering it was made in 1984.The story is very simple  actually there isn't much of one. A group of four people sit around in an abandoned Sydney Opera House worrying about the end of the world. But Duigan uses this merely as a point of departure. With some of the most interesting and subtle uses of flashback that I've seen in a while nice acting and clever uses of Short Memory by Midnight Oil and Fritz Lang's Metropolis Duigan has come up with quite a gem. It doesn't have any of the usual trappings of Australian film  excessive larikanism lack of subtlety and depth cinematic blandness or an irritating effort to be noticeably Australian despite the potentially cumbersome use of Sydney landmarks  and has so many things that many American and world movies lack. One Night Stand is a film with the potential to surprise in an age when we so often think we've seen it all. It's dated a little bit  quite a bit actually  but well it was 1984 so you can't exactly expect it to look like it was made yesterday. But in terms of what it achieves  emotionally politically cinematically  it is avantgarde in the truest sense. Not unwatchable not difficult just truly ahead of the game. And so few films have really caught up in the 20 years since.I just hope that Head in the Clouds can show that Duigan still is rather than just was an amazing filmmaker. More people need to see Lawn Dogs. More people need to see the Danny Emberling films. And judging by the seriously low userrating and startling absence of user comments on IMDb it seems very clear that more people need to see One Night Stand.".

Throughout the movie a white rabbit appears  for what reasons I have yet to figure out  was the director trying to send a message to the viewer? The most impacting scene is the video camera footage broadcast on local TV of distressed and burned survivors somewhere 'north of New York'. This scene really packs a punch!

Burned victims men and women crying out in agony Soldiers in radiation suits guiding blind and burned victims to a make shift shelter where the news camera keys in on people with skin hanging from their bodies charred remains of humans and animals and the piercing cry of women and children! I don't think there is one scene from 'The Day After' or 'Threads' that packed a shocking punch as this one brief scene in the movie One Night Stand. Oh and Midnight Oil is in this movie!

	schema:reviewBody "This film has all the hallmarks of an early nineties indie movie.  Small cast four people.  Single locale the Sydney Opera house.  Single plot thrust the end of the world.  But look at the date.  1984.  So when John Hughes was messing about with teen  movies and the USA thought Tootsie was one of the greatest films of all time Oz had greater concerns.  Almost creating its own genre  the preapocalyptic movie  this film deftly shows what would actually happen in case of such an emergency.  Nothing much.  People would still go on dates.

They don't have stereotypes.  In fact only the navy officer really stands out.  We like them because they are like us.  If I was in that situation I'd probably go a bit stir crazy.

But look at the date.  1984.  So when John Hughes was messing about with teen  movies and the USA thought Tootsie was one of the greatest films of all time Oz had greater concerns.  Almost creating its own genre  the preapocalyptic movie  this film deftly shows what would actually happen in case of such an emergency.  Nothing much.  People would still go on dates.  They'd probably hang out.  Some sex might go on. Then everyone might die.  What's so lovely about this film is that they are real people.  You can't really tell them apart.

	schema:reviewBody "Bend It Like Beckam' is a heartwarming charmer about a young girl's search for identity in 21st Century England.  Like Fiddler on the Roof' Beckam' deals with the painful struggles traditionbound cultures must go through as they enter a looser more freedomloving modern world.  The culture in this case is that of immigrant and firstgeneration Indians living in Great Britain.  As with all such tales it is the young folk who feel the need to pull away from the stuffy values of the past and who end up dragging the reluctant older folk kicking and screaming into the future right along with them.Jess Bharma is a fairly typical teen with dreams of becoming a worldclass soccer player.  However Jess also comes from a very traditional Indian family that believes a girl should not play around with boys show her legs in public or aspire to much beyond marrying a good Indian boy and raising a family.  We've seen this kind of setup countless times before and Bend It Like Beckam' will certainly not win any prizes for creativity or originality.  It does however have a youthful exuberance and a generous spirit that can't help but captivate even the most diehard coldhearted cynic.  Parminder K. Nagra is utterly winning as young Jess capturing all the innate optimism and unquenchable enthusiasm of this irrepressible character.  She receives superb support from a cast of outstanding actors both young and old including Keira Knightley as Jules her inspirational buddy who provides Jess with the opportunity to bring her dreams to fruition Jonathan RhysMeyers as Joe the handsome young coach who provides lessons in love along with lessons in soccer Anupam Kher as Jess' father who turns out to have some of his own personal demons to deal with Shaheen Khan as Jess' mother who doesn't understand why her daughter can't be content with the preordained life her parents have laid out for her and Juliet Stevenson as Jules' mother who proves that Indians don't hold a patent on traditionobsessed parents.  In its quiet gentle way the film also confronts the issue of racism particularly in terms of how the Indians are often still treated as secondclass citizens in British society.As directed by Gurinder Chadha Bend It Like Beckham' is a lightonitsfeet feelgood' film that never takes itself too seriously. The movie suffers a bit from a sitcom mentality as when for instance Jules' parents labor under the illusion that their daughter and Jess are actually lesbian lovers.  The plotting in addition to being predictable at times often seems contrived and excessively melodramatic the rivalry between Jess and Jules over Joe being the primary offender.  But this isn't enough to do any serious damage to the film as a whole.Thus if you're looking for a film that is easygoing uplifting and comfortably oldfashioned in its demeanor and theme Bend It Like Beckham' is for you.".

I am one of those American fools that has no clue. I had never even seen David Beckham before this film. I chose to ignore the buzz surrounding this film at the time it was released in America. Enough about me. Truth be told it was a mistake to ignore this little piece of moviemaking heaven. What a fun film. It's full of color and exuberance. I had a goofy grin on my face through the whole movie. Parminder Nagra is so sweet and lovable you can't help but root for her. No wonder why the American television show E.R. has snatched her up. I have a new appreciation for Indian culture. Those people know how to have a good time. The wedding scenes are dazzlingly beautiful. The only problem I had was deciphering some of the British slang and dialogue through the accents. I turned on the English subtitles to make sure I didn't miss anything. This is not a criticism of the film! I'm sure audiences worldwide have trouble understanding the constantly changing slang in American films as well. This is a perfect date film. It has a great sports plot like Rocky and a strong sense of feminism that is empowering for women. I watched it with my wife and sixteen year old niece and we all loved it. I highly recommend it.".

If that's what you're looking for go somewhere else. Just because it is an independent film does not mean it has to be artsy. It's supposed to make you feel good and you're supposed to have fun watching it and those two things are handily accomplished.Secondly the acting though not Halle Berry in Monster's Ball is still good. The movie doesn't need acting like that honestly so don't look for it. It's a family movie. If that's what you wanted you wouldn't or shouldn't even be looking into this movie honestly.Lastly It has a really cute story. I think it's thought out well and it's entertaining to watch. It's also very true to life for the most part for that culture so if you want to sit down and watch a movie that you can enjoy and feel good about when you're finished. If you're looking for something with deep thought out plot lines and big dramatic scenes this is not for you.Lyndsay".

The setting of transplanted Indianness makes it feel like one of Mira Nair's films  Monsoon Wedding' or Mississippi Masala.'  There's also quite a bit of youthful flippant foulmouthed bluecollar London impertinence going on  an episode of Eastenders' perhaps.And yet to dismiss the movie with this quick sketch and a few references would do it a terrible injustice.  OK no it is perhaps not great.' It's a feelgood movie and while it dips a bit into serious subject waters it doesn't stay down too long.   And it really IS a collection of all these movie formulas  and I submit they do exactly what they're intended to do. It's ALMOST too much but it's not.  The formulas lead to their inevitable pay offs of course but they pay off in ways that are not quite expected. The final outcome is rarely in doubt but throughout the twists and turns the audience at least the audience where I was watching find themselves shamelessly twisting their hankies on the sidelines crying just a little where they're supposed to cry and cheering when they can't but cheer. There is a point at which you want to stand up and clap wildly  it's not at the end so you can't but the audience where I saw it sure wanted to.  I think they felt a little cheated that they couldn't.  The mood of the end is not one conducive to raising the rafters but many clapped softly anyway. Granted the movie isn't timed quite right but it really IS that good  it makes you want to show your gratefulness for the efforts of writer director and actors.Any flaws of timing or plausibility I find I can easily forgive due to the overwhelming charm of the movie's star Parminder K. Nagra.  Her expressions her boundless energy and defiance her ability to convey the conflict her character feels between duty to family and wishing for something more  I was completely taken in from start to finish.  This actress is going places.  She has the kind of playful wit and irreverence you see in the best early John Cusack coupled with a depth to play convincing disappointment and struggle.  If you love Say Anything' with the passion that most true devotees including me do  you will love this film.  In fact if Say Anything' is your favorite film drop whatever you're doing and RUN out to see this film before it leaves theatres. Drive 100 miles if you have to.  It has that same magic.It doesn't hurt that Ms. Nagra possesses a true deep classic beauty and grace akin to that of say a Kelly or a Bergman.  I mean my fellow redblooded males this woman is flatout dropdead stunning.  She's equally fetching as a feisty tomboy jock my personal preference or as an elegant traditionally clad Sikh woman.  Go see it to watch her even if the subject matter isn't your thing.It is perhaps not a great movie but it's one that will due to its sheer quirkiness and great heart likely find its way onto the favorites' shelves of many and not just young girls aspiring to make it big and become soccer stars.  Evidently the movie is a huge hit in England and Germany and Parminder is well on her way to becoming a superstar.  Go out and see what all the fuss is about.P.S. I must beg to differ with the reviewer who claims that women's soccer is not big in the U.S.  Women's soccer is HUGE in the U.S.  there are perhaps ten times as many young women playing soccer in America as in the whole of Europe.  The U.S. national team is THE powerhouse international women's team and has been for almost a decade.  Brandi Chastain's shirtremoving gesture in the 1999 Women's World Cup which graced the cover of Time Newsweek and Sports Illustrated has become iconic.  Young women from around the world most certainly DO aspire to be on American college teams  North Carolina and Santa Clara I believe particularly. American Mia Hamm far and away the greatest women's player of all time dominates the sport like a Michael Jordan.   I'm fairly sure the U.S. is the only country to have a professional women's soccer league maybe Japan as well?. This film is fully aware of this.  If girls' soccer coaches from age five on up don't make this film required viewing for their team they should consider leaving coaching.".

This actress is going places.  She has the kind of playful wit and irreverence you see in the best early John Cusack coupled with a depth to play convincing disappointment and struggle.  If you love Say Anything' with the passion that most true devotees including me do  you will love this film.  In fact if Say Anything' is your favorite film drop whatever you're doing and RUN out to see this film before it leaves theatres. Drive 100 miles if you have to.  It has that same magic.It doesn't hurt that Ms. Nagra possesses a true deep classic beauty and grace akin to that of say a Kelly or a Bergman.  I mean my fellow redblooded males this woman is flatout dropdead stunning.  She's equally fetching as a feisty tomboy jock my personal preference or as an elegant traditionally clad Sikh woman.  Go see it to watch her even if the subject matter isn't your thing.It is perhaps not a great movie but it's one that will due to its sheer quirkiness and great heart likely find its way onto the favorites' shelves of many and not just young girls aspiring to make it big and become soccer stars.  Evidently the movie is a huge hit in England and Germany and Parminder is well on her way to becoming a superstar.  Go out and see what all the fuss is about.P.S. I must beg to differ with the reviewer who claims that women's soccer is not big in the U.S.  Women's soccer is HUGE in the U.S.  there are perhaps ten times as many young women playing soccer in America as in the whole of Europe.  The U.S. national team is THE powerhouse international women's team and has been for almost a decade.  Brandi Chastain's shirtremoving gesture in the 1999 Women's World Cup which graced the cover of Time Newsweek and Sports Illustrated has become iconic.  Young women from around the world most certainly DO aspire to be on American college teams  North Carolina and Santa Clara I believe particularly. American Mia Hamm far and away the greatest women's player of all time dominates the sport like a Michael Jordan.   I'm fairly sure the U.S. is the only country to have a professional women's soccer league maybe Japan as well?. This film is fully aware of this.  If girls' soccer coaches from age five on up don't make this film required viewing for their team they should consider leaving coaching.";

It's a bit movieoftheweek the screenplay is on the paintbynumbers side. And most troublingly the director's commentary implies that in this film beauty can be found primarily amongst the white of skin.The film's genius is not in what's obvious to the Syd Fielddoctored eye character arcs themes construction. It's in both the surface and what lurks deep beneath but not in those layers of artistic topsoil that reviewers seem most often to scratch at. Powerful sometimes semiclad female bodies not simply on display but kicking the crap out of a football do a better job of naturalizing female strength and agility than Lara Croft or Zhang Ziyi will ever do. These are real bodies Keira Knightley's excepted whose work is not to look great first and kick butt later. They are working bodies whose beauty is in their movement and selfdetermination. And in my book lead actress Parminder Nagra is one of the most gorgeous creatures ever captured on screen  not only because she can lay claim to that hackneyed adjective luminous but because her performance has an honesty and unbookish intelligence that's utterly compelling.The result is a film women can enjoy without feeling like they're making a pact with the devil to do so. As in Chadha's Bride and Prejudice the relationships amongst women sizzle with a chemistry that can't be neatly slotted into the stodgy Sweet Valley High categories of best friends or sisters. Perhaps Chadha is even right in her commentary to disavow the film's flirtation with lesbianism. Bend it Like Beckham has an electricity that can't be reduced to the simple heterohomosexual love triangle its conventionally structured script would suggest. The precise nature of its pleasure is ultimately a bit of a mystery  and is all the more seductive for it.Oh yes and did I mention that it's hilarious?".

The acting was fresh and vibrant the characters engaging and the jokes genuinely funny. The entire auditorium was laughing out loud every minute or so. Football fan or no football fan sport became irrelevant to the main principles of love friendship family independence and rivalry. Add a dash of Sikh culture and you have the formula for the best British comedy I've seen in a long time dare I say it.... better than East is East.This film trots along nicely at a lovely pace never dwelling on anything longer than necessary nor leaving anything unfinished keeping the viewer entertained and mentally engaged. Though not a characteristically twistingandturning film there are some pleasant surprises on the way and things don't always happen as you would expect.Saying that there were elements of predictability but these were exploited satirically more than used as scriptfillers. I suppose depending on your particular penchant for happyendings you could be either delightedlet down by the ending. Personally if there was any other outcome I would have written a strongly worded letter to the script writers.As for the actors I would have to say that Juliet Stevenson Paula put in the finest performance. I never knew that people like that existed but she her realism with sometimes bizarre concepts has convinced me that they possibly do! Prize for the most unconvincing of the main characters goes unfortunately to Kiera Knightley Jules but don't get me wrong even she offered a great performance it's just that someone has to be last of the best and sorry Kiera this time you're it.Tip Don't leave before the credits. Once the lights came back up I realised to my horror that perhaps I shouldn't have watched this film after all. My beloved but forgotten Ice Junkie had melted into a sugary blue juice. Oh what am I saying it was absolutely brill and I can't recommend it enough. I will definitely buy it when it comes out and add it to my collection of 3 videos. I'm a student.

Despite the good acting of some people among which Parminder Nagra who I already mentioned Anupam Kher Ameet Chana and Juliet Stevenson the acting skills of others were making me wonder how they could make a living as actors. Oh well I suppose Keira Knightly has her looks and she shows off plenty of body parts to make the male audience drool if they like nearanorectic girls. I gave her another chance with this movie after being impressed with the absence of any acting skills in Pirates but this movie showed I was right in my judgment. Jonathan RhysMeyers' acting was as natural as banana bubblegum. He must have read his lines off some board! He would have fitted perfectly in 'Days of our Lives' the way he was overacting every feeling and gesture.Anyway this could have been an okay movie had the acting been better and had I not had these expectations. I can't believe this movie's rating is 7.4. I can't give more than 5 stars.".

Not to mention that living in London her soccer idol is David Beckham. Jesminder and Juliette start to be friends since both girls have many things in common. Or should I say way too much in commonwhen it has to do with the couch? Of course we do have many stereotypes in this movielike Jesminder's family but we cannot forget that even in the present days is quite common to have many conservative people and families.I really liked the ending and I didn't expect that the couch would really have that big interest for Jesminder what in my opinionmakes the movie cooler.

Pinky Archie Panjabi works as a stewardess out of nearby Heathrow but her daytoday private life centers around family and family friends  and typical of many first generation immigrants the immediate environment is like an appendage of the old country. Pinky's self worth is measured by only one goal and it has been influenced culturally by her mother since infancy  marry a good upstanding Sikh and raise a family. Pinky's equally pretty younger sister and our heroine Jesminder Jess Parminder Nagra also lives in a world where nearly all human contact is Punjabi. Outside the house in school or public places she is a typical teenager  except that she wants to be a professional football soccer playerthe film opens with Jess daydreaming that she takes a pass from Manchester United's soccer superstar David Bend It Like BECKHAM and scores on a header.Jess is befriended by Juliette Jules Paxton Keira Knightly who invites her to join a local girls soccer team. Without fanfare this is the film's key event that opens all doors and windows  as Jules' family is drawn into the cultural mix  wherein WE begin to understand the film's point of view.The relationship between Jess and Jules is not presented as an example of cultural differences but more as teenagers of one mind  the two are more like each other at this age than they are like their respective parents  they enjoy boys both have crush on the coach shopping sports rock music and whatever young girls do and talk about. And despite spats they are mutually supportive  and good friends.The girls' parents provide the film with definition and its better moments. Both fathers Anupam Kher and Frank Harper are supportive and permissive  pushovers for their daughters  whereas the mothers are pragmatic traditionalists looking out for the best interests of their children. Mrs. Bhamra Shahee Khan is a mother hen often grousing the coop  she wants both daughters married with respectable dowries preferably matched high on the socioeconomic ladder and her grandchildren reared culturally as Sikhs following the teachings of spiritual leader Babaji. Mrs. Paxton Juliette Stevenson is no less involved in her daughter's future  believing that women should be wives and keepers of the household. As mothers my mother yours and all mothers Mrs. Bhamra and Mrs. Paxton have more in common with each other than they do with their respective long standing socialcultural groups. Ms. Stevenson has one of the film's better roles and she executes it with humor and sensitivity.We are grateful to Ms. Gurinder Chadha for this colorful and wonderfully outrageous look at a Sik family undergoing the pangs of westernization. A more universal point of view on the parents might have been appreciated with sharper character studies and maybe a camera or editing less prone to a sound bite style  thereby adding a few minutes of film length. But none of these comments indicate a lack of enjoyment and respect for Ms. Chadha's achievement. The film includes some sexual content including discussions on homosexuality and some objectionable language but all is within character contextual and acceptable viewing by preteens with parents present. And if you have difficulty understanding the foreign language spoken in the UK click on the English subtitles of your DVD.We hardly notice the Sikh Temples rising in our communities or Sikh students in Harvard Yard or their parents' successes in business including agriculture medicine and branches of engineering  or Sikhs occupying seats of government in England. The transition and success of immigrant families is no longer unique  and it is better that it be commonplace and accepted as such. Although the fresh and exciting differences stirred into the melting pot are welcomed we have learned that when parents and growing children are at issue  we are one universal family. We watched the Bhamra children grow up as our neighbors and we ate drank sang and danced too much at Pinky's wedding. This film is not about how we are different  it is about how we are alike. Mrs. Bhamra will have to occasionally forego her aloo gobi chappatis and dal to join us  her new friends  at McDonalds to dine in style on a Big Mac fries and a coke.".

First of all its not typical Hollywood product which is a magnificent beginning and you know that the directorscreenwriter just had a vision of what kind of movie that they could make and didn't get all caught up in all that LA garbage you hear about.  They actually had a story to tell had to sell it and someone believed in the project. I found some of the romanticdramatic subplots slightly juvenile but I'm a 40something guy so its kind of natural that kind of thing might annoy me at times.I'd only seen RhysMyers in Velvet Goldmine which I didn't enjoy but here he's very good and has a lot qualities I like in an actor.  His eyes are very expressive and the camera picks that up.  You don't learn that you just have it or you don't.  I like him enough to risk seeing the project he's doing for Woody Allen.  For all the subpar movies Woody's made in the past ten years I never once questioned his choice of actors and I'm certainly not starting now.  Have fun with the movie.  It doesn't change the world and thankfully doesn't want to either.  710.".

First of all its not typical Hollywood product which is a magnificent beginning and you know that the directorscreenwriter just had a vision of what kind of movie that they could make and didn't get all caught up in all that LA garbage you hear about.  They actually had a story to tell had to sell it and someone believed in the project. I found some of the romanticdramatic subplots slightly juvenile but I'm a 40something guy so its kind of natural that kind of thing might annoy me at times.I'd only seen RhysMyers in Velvet Goldmine which I didn't enjoy but here he's very good and has a lot qualities I like in an actor.  His eyes are very expressive and the camera picks that up.  You don't learn that you just have it or you don't.  I like him enough to risk seeing the project he's doing for Woody Allen.  For all the subpar movies Woody's made in the past ten years I never once questioned his choice of actors and I'm certainly not starting now.  Have fun with the movie.  It doesn't change the world and thankfully doesn't want to either.  710.";

	schema:headline " Maestros join hands to create a musical aura";
	schema:reviewBody "Bollywood's greatest showman and legendary filmmaker Raj Kapoor started his own production house and his journey as a film director with Aag 1948. However he wanted to make a complete team of himself which could continue for years like a strong and wellcoordinated unit and moreover like a family. He wanted it especially in terms of music because he put a heavy premium on the musical score of his movies. This team he could make with his second production as well as directorial venture  Barsaat 1949. With Barsaat an aura of melodious music started in Bollywood whose nucleus was Raj Kapoor and his production house  R.K. Banner. Raj Kapoor's musical team included lyricists  Hasrat Jaipuri and Shailendra music composers  Shankar Jaikishan and singers  Lata Mangeshkar and Mukesh. Starting from Barsaat this music making team presented many great albums to the music lovers containing several immortal songs.Barsaat rain tells the story of two friends  Pran Raj Kapoor who believes in true love and Gopal Premnaath who believes in 'enjoy and forget' philosophy. These two friends are roaming about countryside when they happen to meet two different girls. Pran falls for the charms of Reshma Nargis whereas Gopal comes across Neela Nimmi. Pran decides to unite with Reshma against all odds but Gopal ignores Neela after returning to the city these two friends belong to. Neela keeps the flame of Gopal's love as burning in her heart while waiting for him in her small old house situated on a hill. After a lot of sentimental drama Pran is able to make Reshma his life partner whereas Gopal realizes the importance of true love in a man's life but he is able to come back to Neela only when it's too late.The movie is very touching and a beautifully made one. Director Raj Kapoor had started demonstrating his skill in making heartconquering love stories right from his debut venture  Aag. In this second venture of himself he has gone a few steps farther and presented a mesmerizing lovesoaked narrative which contains two different love stories  one with a happy ending and the other one being a tragedy. Different people have different perceptions of malefemale love. The thinking patterns of different ones are bound to be different according to their upbringing and lifeexperiences. It was as true in that era of the forties as it is true today. Gopal of Barsaat does not believe in true love and feels that philandering with different females is the correct way of life until the eyeopening moment comes for him. It may happen with anybody. My knowledge about romantic love was also academic only until I got someone's true love for real.This very well made movie written by Ramanand Saagar who later on became a very famous movie and TV serial director in his own right is very interesting and the narrative flows very well. The songs are too many but they do not irritate or bore. Instead they enhance the enjoyment of the viewer like anything just like the icing on a cake. The story meanders through many turns and reaches its heartpiercing climax impressively leaving a throbbing in the heart of the viewer with the ending scene. I feel Raj Kapoor could have avoided the tragic ending of the movie and substituted it with a happy ending. However it's to be admitted that despite appearing somewhat out of place the tragic ending has made a greater impact than what would have been made by a happy ending for the love story of Gopal and Neela.As said earlier the biggest plus point of Barsaat is its music only. Music maestros joined hands for the first time under the stewardship of Raj Kapoor and created an aura which is everlasting. The movie opens with a beautiful song  Hawa Mein Udta Jaaye Mera Laal Dupatta Malmal Ka which has been picturized on a long forgotten actress  Vimla. Thereafter the whole movie is a treat for the music lovers from the side of the composers the lyricists the singers and above all the legendary filmmaker Raj Kapoor. Jiya Beqaraar Hai Chhai Bahaar Hai Barsaat Mein Humse Mile Tum Sajan Tumse Mile Hum Mujhe Kisi Se Pyar Ho Gaya Mera Aankhon Mein Bas Gaya Koi Re Chhod Gaye Baalam Mujhe Haay Akela Chhod Gaye etc. etc. etc. there's a long musical river for the listeners to float on the waves of melodies. Barsaat's music is immortal and will continue to enchant the melody lovers for ages. The movie contains a foottapper also  Patli Kamar Hai Tirchhi Nazar Hai on which famous dancer Cuckoo has delivered a mesmerizing performance.This black and white movie is technically superior. Almost everything is perfect or near perfect. The picturization of certain songs in the rain being true to the title of the movie is simply wonderful. Raj Kapoor believed in presenting the songs of his movies on the screen in the most beautiful manner possible thus making the audience love to watch them again and again. Barsaat is a standing example of this belief and ability of himself.Performances are also brilliant. Raj Kapoor himself was a great actor. And under his own direction he was truly extraordinary. Alongwith himself he has extracted admirable performances from Nargis Premnaath and debutante Nimmi who went ahead to play a long and successful innings in Bollywood after this movie. Supporting cast has also done well.In the presently running rainy season it won't be in appropriate to watch this classic from the black and white era of Hindi cinema whose rain is an inseparable part of. I recommend this blockbuster movie to all the cinelovers in general and melody lovers in particular. Allow yourself to be drenched in this rain of music love and emotion.".

It is a serious even dour film that focuses equally on both sides of the espionage fence with sympathies for neither.  Here spying is a business but it is not without its emotions albeit suppressed and discarded as required and death is almost always a matter of honor.  When death is unexpected it is also unfair a matter of happenstance that triggers far reaching consequences.The plot consists of good guys and bad guys trying to out maneuver each other while both are after Stephane Audran.  The complexities of the film extend beyond plotting.  The good' guys in the film are hardly more than cyphers they play the espionage odds sometimes winning sometimes losing without developing traits one would associate with human character.  The bad' guys on the other hand are well rounded people that suffer and consider but do their jobs anyway.Suicide the controlled death plays a large part in the film.  It is a means of conquering enemies expressing love admitting defeat.  It's those that live on in their confusion and misery that we must pity.  This fine mood piece is complimented by a melancholy score by Francois de Roubaix which captures the ennui without bringing too much attention to itself.".

One of these commanders is Colonel Thomas Blake. He and his men raid the farms towns and settlements where Yankees live. Rumors abound about Colonel Blake having gone insane. Many claim that Blake robs and kills for his own pleasure and personal gain rather than in the name of Confederacy. The authorities post huge rewards for the capture or killing of Colonel Blake and his men. However Blake is shrewd and hard to entrap. He too wants money. More specifically Colonel Blake is after the 200 thousand dollars that vanished in the final days of the war from the Confederate coffers. The money was last seen in the strong box of Confederate General Beauregard. Blake sends a trusted aide Chamaco Gonzales to inquire among the Confederate veterans and disbanded soldiers about the whereabouts of General Beauregard's strong box. But Chamaco is ...";

The opening starts with a pseudodocumentary narrative which introduces the characters. While in THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN the introduced characters are the heroes here they are the baddies. Later the characters aren't much further developed though. The strong aspect of the film is the uncertainty about the intentions of the Stuart character well played by Edd Byrnes. He doesn't seem to be a good guy but maybe there is a reason why he kills so many innocent people. Guy Madison plays equally convincing his counterpart Blake.Overall an OK violent western with a good Francesco De Masi score which supports the pace of the story.5  10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Macarroni Western starred by two ordinary Spaghetti actors as Guy Madison and Edd Byrnes  both of whom played several Italian oaters . Simple but effective Western that has all the classic ingredients of a good Spaghetti . It deals with a gunman named Stuart Edd Byrnes joins up with a gang of Confederate guerrillas commanded by Col. Thomas Blake Guy Madison to find a cache of missing Confederate gold . Set during post Civil War a misfit group carries out a risked travel beyond enemy lines  as Stuart teams up a motley bunch  including a veteran captain and other various colleagues Ryk Boyd and Ennio Girolami  among others to help them out by promising a massive reward if it succeeds . As the meanest rebel ever born lives only to make 'em die . They must pull off the dangerous objective  as Stuart and the ambitious drifters join forces to take a lot of money from confederacy that has been buried into an Indian cemetery similarly to The good  the bad and the ugly . The dangerous assignment is set against stark environment  Union soldiers attacks and hazardous trails . As the battle for victory has ended but the war for vengeance goes on.This enjoyable Ravioli Western packs thrills action  brawls  crossfire and drags at times  balancing in ups and downs . There is plenty of action in the movie  guaranteeing shootouts  fights or stunts every few minutes . This is an agreeable Western all'Italiana dealing with a continuous confrontation among protagonists and both of them against several opponents . The movie has the typical European Western characters  as the bloody facing off  greedy antiheroes dusty and spectacular showdowns  extreme baddies  and being rightly directed . This Italian Western was filmed in 1967  a notorious year in the development of European western that almost doubled since former year with movies mostly filmed in Spain and Italy . Director Enzo G Castell makes a nice camera work with some zooms and clever choreography on the showdown  fighting  spectacular shootouts and entertaining scenes . The film blends violence  high bodycount and it's fast moving and quite entertaining  there is a very odd implementation of shots in the camera work during some particular scenes as the film approaches its climax  as in the ending gunfights and the customary showdown conclusion . Guy Madison's performance in the movie is a bit wooden for the role of such an interesting character a rebel confederate Colonel similarly to Quantrill or Anderson  but the fantastic performance by Edd Byrnes as a likable gunslinger saves the show . Edd is very fine  he ravages the screen  he jumps  bounds and leaps  hit and run . Byrnes as a brave and twofisted gunfighter is terrific  subsequently the would play similar roles in other Spaghettis as Professionals for a Massacre by Nando Cicero and Any can gun play by Enzo G Castell . Ennio Girolami  Marino Girolami's son  plays as a cruelly baddie role he is pretty good  subsequently he would play similar characters in various oaters and Spaghettis  many of them directed by his brother Enzo G Castellari . The musician Francesco De Massi composes a nice soundtrack  well conducted  this turns out to be one of the most memorable parts of the movie  adding catching songs at the initiation and final .The film was well producedwritten by Marino Girolami who used pseudonyms as Fred Wilson or Dario Silvestri  he is father of Enzo G. Castellari and Ennio Girolami and brother of Romolo Guerrieri . Marino wrote and directed several Western such as Badmen of the West Two Ringos from Texas God Was in the West Too at One Time  God Was in the West Too at One Time . The motion picture was professionally directed by Enzo G Castell . Enzo usually makes experimental editing techniques such as unbroken transitions from one scene to another and a cameo appearance in his films . Castellari often works with Guido and Maurizio De Angelis and uses to do slow motion shootouts and choreographic death scenes . Enzo is a good a craftsman working in all kind of genres  as he made Western especially . His first one was Some dollars for Django codirected by Leon Klimovsky  but actually for the most part of its filming by the disagreements arising with Klimovsky was realized by Enzo G. Castellari which this film was his directorial debut in a subgenre that became one of its greatest representatives  in fact if you compare the beginning of 7 Winchester for a massacre which would direct the next year and the end this one seem to be similar direction . After that  he went on directing  Johnny Hamlet  Kill them everybody and came back alone Tedeum  Cipolla colt and the masterpiece  Keoma and finally its inferior sequel Jonathan of the Bears also with Franco Nero . Some of them are serious  others are goofy and plenty of slapstick and slapdash . This Seven Winchester for a massacre is a bewildering story  enjoyable in lots of parts and it will appeal to Spaghetti Western fans . It's a passable film  and better than a lot of the ulterior spaghetti western to come .".

Enzo usually makes experimental editing techniques such as unbroken transitions from one scene to another and a cameo appearance in his films . Castellari often works with Guido and Maurizio De Angelis and uses to do slow motion shootouts and choreographic death scenes . Enzo is a good a craftsman working in all kind of genres  as he made Western especially . His first one was Some dollars for Django codirected by Leon Klimovsky  but actually for the most part of its filming by the disagreements arising with Klimovsky was realized by Enzo G. Castellari which this film was his directorial debut in a subgenre that became one of its greatest representatives  in fact if you compare the beginning of 7 Winchester for a massacre which would direct the next year and the end this one seem to be similar direction . After that  he went on directing  Johnny Hamlet  Kill them everybody and came back alone Tedeum  Cipolla colt and the masterpiece  Keoma and finally its inferior sequel Jonathan of the Bears also with Franco Nero . Some of them are serious  others are goofy and plenty of slapstick and slapdash . This Seven Winchester for a massacre is a bewildering story  enjoyable in lots of parts and it will appeal to Spaghetti Western fans . It's a passable film  and better than a lot of the ulterior spaghetti western to come .";

And yes it has obviously a lower budget than both the aforementioned films. But when the borrowed stories are so good there doesn't seem to be a problem in my eyes in recounting extended versions of such tales. So I really enjoyed this film in its own right.The leading role does owe more than a nod of the cowboy hat to Eastwood's Man with No Name and in that respect Byrnes is not an ample substitute. To me he is far too clean looking although like Eastwood's character he will do whatever he needs to in order to get a job done. The show stealers are Blake played by Guy Madison and that rarest of things  a spaghetti western female role Loiuse Barrett.Whilst not as outstanding as some other Castellari films say Keoma and Jonathan and the Bears it is still a highly enjoyable Spaghetti Western fare that I would recommend to fans of this genre.".

Spaghetti Western I've watched from director Castellari whom I met at the 2004 Venice Film Festival  it's not too bad an effort actually though still far away from the admirably elegiac quality he would eventually achieve in KEOMA 1976.The plot is pretty typical of the genre after the end of the Civil War a Confederate Colonel Guy Madison wants to keep up the fight and recruits a band of outlaws to finance his campaign through random pillaging given that the original Italian title makes an explicit reference to the fact that the gang totals seven men I guess the film intended to be a roguish version of THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN 1960! Anyway as expected an outsider Edd Byrnes soon joins their ranks  after having rescued one of them Enio Girolami the director's brother and who in the role of a peon irritatingly speaks almost exclusively in Spanish throughout!.

The film features plenty of action  set to a rousing score by Francesco De Masi  and climaxes agreeably with an atmospheric sequence set inside a cave where the now worthless money is stashed that served as burial ground for some Indian tribe or other.".

	schema:headline " Violent AboveAverage Spaghetti Western!";
	schema:reviewBody "Payment in Blood qualifies as a violent aboveaverage Spaghetti western shoot'em up with a high body count. Like director Sergio Leone's bigger budgeted The Good the Bad and the Ugly the leaner budgeted Payment in Blood concerns the quest for buried treasure. The outlaw villains embark on a search for a fabled fortune approximately 200thousand stashed at an undisclosed location by Confederate General Beauregard. Of course anybody who knows anything about Civil War history knows Beauregard hid no such loot. Typically most westerns that appropriate this plot attribute the lost Confederate gold to President Jefferson Davis. Ironically during the opening credits sequence which contains a montage of Civil War photographs you won't see a picture of Beauregard while you will see pictures of Abraham Lincoln Robert E. Lee and Ulysses S. Grant. The protagonist Stuart Edd Byrnes of Any Gun Can Play has a grudge to settle with the head villain Guy Madison of Massacre River and his gang of bloodthirsty gunmen. Primarily known overseas as Seven Winchesters for a Massacre Payment in Blood constituted writer  director Enzo G. Castellari's third western. Castellari's first western at the helm was Few Dollars for Django for which he received no credit and Any Gun Can Play was his second oater with a bigger better cast. Payment in Blood doesn't top either Any Gun Can Play or a later Castellari Civil War western Kill Them All and Come Back Alone with Chuck Connors. Longtime screen writing collaborator Tito Carpi of Few Dollars for Django and Bullets and the Flesh scribe Marino Girolami penned the formulaic plot with Castellari for Payment in Blood. The difference between Payment in Blood and Any Gun Can Play is the latter is more elaborate than the former. Payment in Blood amounts to a rather contrived western that uses the venerable plot about an individual who goes undercover to infiltrate a gang of homicidal criminals and thwart them. The dialogue is neither as amusing as Any Gun Can Play but Payment in Blood boasts a surprise ending. Although it seems like scores of men wind up with bullet holes during the numerous shootouts Payment in Blood lacks the titular element that became such a fixture in later westerns like The Wild Bunch. The frontier action takes place in 1867 after the conclusion of the American Civil War. A renegade Confederate officer Colonel Thomas Blake Guy Madison of Five against the House refuses to stop fighting Union authorities and leads his troops on raids against the army and civilians alike. During the opening moments of Payment in Blood writer  director Enzo G. Castellari introduces us to not only the pugnacious Blake but also the hellspawn that ride with him. Included in this notorious gang are Chamaco Gonzales Ennio Girolami of The Hellbenders Rios Aysanoa Runachagua of El Cisco Fred Calhoun Federico Boido of Planet of the Vampires Zeb Russel and Mesa Alvarez Attilio Severini of Massacre at Grand Canyon. Blake and his marauders carry out indiscriminate raids steal horses loot houses and kill men women and children without a qualm. Most of this information is imparted to us by nameless supporting players standing around wanted posters of Blake men and complaining about his depredations. The reward on Blake's head has risen to 5thousand. Chamaco rides into a town one day and eavesdrops on a conversation between a crippled former Confederate soldier and a cowboy. What can you expect from a rotten war like ours? Brother against brother. When you teach a man it's right to kill how can you unteach him? The other man observes about Blake's killers They have learned to like being heroes. They've learned to like killing. Chamaco confronts the crippled Southerner Jeremy because the latter had ridden with General Beauregard and may know the location of the lost treasure. Before he can learn anything from Jeremy Chamaco has to kill him. A military tribunal sentences Chamaco to die in front of an army firing squad. Stuart surprises the military and rescues Chamaco just as the soldiers are about to execute him. You see Stuart is driving a wagon past the firing squad when he delivers his ultimatum to the army. He shoots the officer's sword and several Winchester rifles spring from the wagon suggesting that several men are aiming those long guns. As it turns out nobody is aiming those rifles and Stuart has packed a bag of dynamite in the wagon bed so when one of the soldiers opens fire on the vehicle the wagon vanishes in an explosion.Chamaco takes Stuart to Blake's camp after they sneak across the Rio Grande without attracting attention from the border patrols. It seems that Stuart served as one of General Beauregard's chiefs of staff. Stuart's introduction to Blake's gang and his ability to match them at their expertise makes for a good scene. The photography of Zeb snatching the revolver out of Stuart's holster with his bull whip is exciting. After he arrives in Blake's camp Stuart refuses to divulge the whereabouts of the loot to the cunning colonel. Eventually Stuart does reveal the location and they find a strong box buried in an Indian cemetery. Things take a turn for the worst when Blake discovers that the money in the strong box is a pile of worthless Confederate bank notes. Meantime the survivors of the Durango come after Blake for killing their husbands. Edd Byrnes appears out of place with his cleanshaven features among a cast of characters who sport some form of facial hair. Guy Madison is suitably murderous as the bad guy in a role that he rarely played. The first time that we see Madison as Colonel Blake Blake rides out of a cloud of gunfire in a town that his men and he are shooting up. Composer Francesco De Masi provides a charismatic orchestral score that perks up this western. Once you've heard De Masi's flavorful score you won't forget it.".

	schema:headline " This Spaghetti Western was kinda messy. It was all over the place.";
	schema:reviewBody "The first thing you'll probably notice about this movie is the fact that the filmmakers couldn't figure out what to call this film. 'Seven Winchesters for a Massacre' 'Renegade Riders' 'Blake's Marauders' 'Payment in Blood' Last Resort' 'The Final Defeat' and 'Winchester for Hire' has all been used to describe this movie. Since the movie has multiply titles it has really confuse most of the viewers. Directed by E.G Rowland AKA Enzo G. Castellari the movie tells the story of a mysterious gunman Stuart Ed Byrnes who joins up with a gang of exConfederate led by renegade Colonel Thomas Blake Guy Madison in an attempt to find buried treasure from the American Civil War. Without spoiling the movie too much I have to say the movie really tries too hard to be the next 'The Good the Bad and the Ugly'. There are way too many similarities to that Sergio Leone's 1966 film. While many people believe that Ed Byrnes kinda looks and acts like Clint Eastwood's 'Man of No Name' in certain scenes in my opinion he looks and acts more like Casey Affleck in 2007's 'The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford'. Without telling too much about him all I can say is that the twist and turns with his character somewhat doesn't make sense. If he's supposed to be the good guy then why does he kills a lot of innocent people!? It doesn't make sense. It really get more befuddling toward the end when it turn out he was indeed a good guy and had a 'partner' who a few scenes earlier left him to die and was working with the bad guys. They really tossed out the logic of the film out of the window by this point of the film. Because of that it's by far one of the weakest parts of the film. You know the movie has a problem when most people find themselves rooting for the group of rapist and murders over the large amount of faceless not establish good guys. You know then that the film has went the wrong direction. Guy Madison as the villain Thomas Blake was meh for the most part. I like how he does have a commanding voice. Yet his role was nothing new and comes across as somewhat dull. Reportedly Madison had drinking problems while making this film. So it was no surprise that he often look like he hasn't slept in days. He just look tired  bored of acting the same type of roles. He was indeed typecast as a Civil War officer way too many times. Despite that I did like the group of sadistic cutthroats that made up Blake's Raiders. First off you got the Tuco ripoff Chamaco Gonzales played by Thomas Moore AKA Ennio Girolami who pretty much set up the plot. Then you got the quiet Indian Rios played by Alfred Aysanoa AKA Aysanoa Runachagua whom looks like he set out of the wrong movie. My favorite in the gang has to be the sadist Mesa Alvarez Attilio Severini who uses his spurs to kill or torture people  the cowardly Frenchman cooksommelier Levasseur Piero Vida. Both were very memorable. I like how much the gang reminds a bit of Director Sergio Corbucci's 1967's 'Hellbenders' mixed with Director John Sturges's 1960's hit 'The Magnificent Seven'. Anyways I like how each one of them having their own set of weapons and gimmick for a campaign of violence. I love how the movie kinda introduce them. It's by far one of the best opening sequences I had seen in a Spaghetti Western. Yet I can't say the same toward the laterhalf when Louise Barrett AKA Lousie Baratto's character Manuela was introduced. That scene comes out of nowhere and seem very awkward. Her character really wasn't needed. Another thing I wish the movie could had done better is in the video language transfer department. Not everything in the film was converted back into the English language for the US and UK release as the original Italian dubbing was still there. It was so badly done. Because of that it really took me out of the film. It's just too weird to see characters jump from one language to the other. Still the soundtrack by Francesco De Masi was very exciting to listen to. The opening credits with the Civil War photos background was kinda cool because of that. Another thing that wrong about this film is its tone. It's all over the place. What a weird hodgepodge of odd comedy mixed with gritty extreme violence. While the action was amazing the problem is so parts is a bit too unrealistic. I don't particularly like those obnoxious gimmick gun tricks this movie has. Candles are shot from a candlestick a waterjug is shot from a person's mouth playing cards are shot from another person's hands and last a gun being whipped out of a holster are a bit over the top. The editing is also not very inspired at times the movie appears rather uninspired and loosely put together. Some scenes just ended midsentences and begin with no establishing shots. It was very jarring. The movie's visuals is substandard but it kinda works enough to reach the end of the climax. So I can't complain about that. Overall Whatever this movie wants to calls itself. I have to say I was somewhat disappointed in how the film turn out. Great opening but pretty crappy delivery toward the end. I really can't recommended watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "Enzo G. Castellari was a director who seemed to contribute films in a variety of genres from scifi to giallo. I get the feeling that his best ones are his spaghetti westerns though. In Payment in Blood he delivers a pretty solid entry. Its story features a renegade Confederate colonel who refuses to accept the South's defeat in the American Civil War and so continues the fight with a band of outlaws. A stranger saves one of his gang from execution and is taken into their fold when he reveals that he knows the whereabouts of a casket of buried money.It would only be fair to say that the plotline has quite a few similarities with Sergio Leone's Dollars Trilogy. Its hero however looks a little different from the shady leads from other spaghettis. He looks more like a character from an American traditional western although he still has the same amorality and essentially acts in a similar way. The villains are decent enough and there is a fair amount of violent action to keep us entertained. Things are wrapped up with an interesting enough climax in an Indian burial ground located in a cave. Overall this is an entertaining if unremarkable western and should definitely find approval with fans of the Italian strand.".

Do those reviewers simply want people to stop renting these guys' films so they stop making money and movies altogether? I am on the other end of the spectrum. I want to see these guys star in MORE films and in continually BETTER films. With that being said here's a review from one of the good guys in black. THE CUTTER is definitely worth a rental. It's a fastpaced little actioner with touches of drama and mystery thrown in. The film opens with a bang involving a hangglider a mummy excavation and one mean villain played by Daniel Bernhardt. Then Chuck makes his first appearance. He's a private eye out to rescue a hostage being held for ransom. After he dispatches the criminals an investigating detective asks Chuck Did you have to throw him out of the window? In classic deadpan form Chuck responds I needed some air. Nobody can deliver a line like that as well as Chuck Norris!The rest of the story involves the kidnapping of an expert jewel cutter Bernie Kopell Doc from THE LOVE BOAT and Chuck's attempts to find and rescue him. There are several showstopping fights including Daniel Bernhardt's confrontation with an unknown grey haired agent whose fighting style resembles Jeff Speakman's kenpo moves and a great close quarter fight between Bernhardt and Norris inside a passenger bus! Both of those are real doozies that should please any serious martial arts action fan. Overall the fights in THE CUTTER are a little more reality based in style and therefore shorter and sloppier than those found in many kung fu films but hey that's what real fighting looks like!To add to the film's charm are a couple of lovely costars Joanna Pacula GORKY PARK and Tracy Scoggins BABYLON 5 DEAD ON. Both ladies are very pleasing on the eyes and both have excellent chemistry with Mr. Norris. It's great to see Chuck back in form as the star of a nonWalker movie Although I still can't wait for that next Walker reunion flick that will hopefully tie up the loose ends that were left in the last one! and I hope he continues to make films on a more regular basis. His sons and brothers continue to show interest in working behind the scenes and are lucky to have a great showcase to work with in their more famous relative. Here's to continued success for and from the Norris family!Here's a quick list of other mustsee Chuck Norris films for new fans A FORCE OF ONE CODE OF SILENCE THE OCTAGON AN EYE FOR AN EYE WAY OF THE DRAGON aka RETURN OF THE DRAGON and SLAUGHTER IN SAN FRANSISCO.Oh and while I'm at it here are a couple of other fairly recent martial arts movies that are well worth a watch WAKE OF DEATH JeanClaude Van Damme REDEMPTION MOVING TARGET Don The Dragon Wilson UNDER THE GUN Richard Norton and INTO THE SUN Steven Seagal.".

Sheperd's life is shattered when he blames the police for not doing their job. Determined to get over it he runs himself into another case.. This time when a diamond cutter's father is mysteriously kidnapped. Sheperd takes on the case which leads into something more sinister. Someone has stolen an artifact from the Sinai desert and the diamonds have been vanished.Enter Daniel Bernhardt who plays Dirk. A ruthless criminal who works for Col. Speerman Curt Lowens.. As the film goes on everything about these characters begin to fall into place with some consequences..This film is one of Norris's best. Although he maybe old but still he's tough enough to play the good guy all round. Still beating the crp out of the bad guys.. Daniel Bernhardt who plays the villain.. He was good.. He was more of a ruthless assassin who just gets what he wants.. Killing people who stands in his way until he squares off against Norris in a climatic fighting scene at the end.There was also Tracy Scoggins.. who I haven't seen on film for quite some time. She stood out great. She was amazing! And Joanna Pacula.. Great performance.. Still the same Joanna!Bill Tannen's directing was also good. Although the idea of this fast forward sequence which we see in the film is good. At least in some films.. It didn't drag on too long. Tannen kept the pace going right until the end.Well I had a great time watching this flick.. Good action from start to finish! 8 out of 10!".

The theme of Nazi Germany is implied with the cutter that Norris's character goes looking for after the jeweler's daughter comes to Norris since he's been missing. The fight scenes are authentic and show that Norris can still move well compared to Seagall who can't even stand on one leg and do rapid fires. The bus fight scene is very well done as its result is something you don't see much of. The obligatory fight finale is better than I thought. It's definitely choreographed but hey if it wasn't someone might get hurt. Overall the production quality had 1980's written all over it but sometimes it's good to nostalgic. Norris still has the confidence and his popularity seems to re emerged on the spoof level. It could do his career good look what it did for William Shatner.".

One of the first things that caught my attention is that this wasn't one of Chuck's classic action movies. This one was released in 2005 back when Chuck was 65 so I figured that it wouldn't be up to par with his classic films but would make for a fun viewing. First off it looks as if no money went into this movie. Considering this is a straight to DVD movie i'm guessing most of the money went to Chuck. The acting is also horrible in this film. You know you've got a problem when Norris is the best actor in your movie. However you don't go into a Chuck Norris movie looking for anything but some good acting. That's where The Cutter once again fails. The action in this movie is some of the worst i've seen in a long time. The editing is so awful that I would have to call it some of the worst editing i've ever seen in a film. It's done so poorly it takes you out of the action and just makes you look for all the mistakes that were done in the editing.

Now Chuck is of course a pensioner now and although he's in excellent shape he is how Gibson and Glover might say too old for this st! It's true Chuck has made a living some 30 plus years kicking people in the head he is much loved for doing so. Now as far as action stars go Chuck is one who is a bit of a personality void. He doesn't really have the charisma of an Arnold and somehow doesn't have star power he seems to much of a nice guy everyman while similarly he didn't get by on his looks either. Sure Chuck Norris was a great asskicker but wooden he most certainly is. Chuck never really had much personality on screen even wooden stars like Seagal and Van Damme did. Chuck had some roles where he was okay and he plays the quiet calm hero well.Anyway what all my anti Chuck relates to is the Cutter. At 65 he now is heavily doubled. The fights are also poorly thought out and filmed in order to make life easier to include Chuck in his master shots etc. There are several fights in this film all of which are markedly similar. Chuck swings punches like John Wayne cowboy fighting on his master shot while the coverage shots are filming his double from behind doing the same dull punching slightly faster and throwing in the odd kick. In his fights Chuck is generally filmed waste up swinging lefts and rights and that's it. The thing is he is participating in a good length of these reasonably long fights especially when you compare that Seagal regularly gets doubled and sometimes isn't even there for his master shots. So the fights in Cutter are incredibly that's the truth. The rest of the action too is dull from poorly conceived shootouts to lame car chases. Daniel Bernhardt still in his action man prime is also wasted and of course when he fights Chuck the simple fact that they are filmed to hide Chucks double and Chucks lack of speed Bernhardt can't do much.The Cutter is best described as boring. If compared to Seagal's recent films it's at least competently made but the plot holds no interest Norris seems bored and only Bernhardt not known for his acting ability seems remotely interesting as a character and performer. it's really just a dinosaur of a film that is kind of bottom shelf from the 80's and has made it's way to the present day. Only the score from Elia Cmiral goes beyond the mundane in this and he proves reliable for these sorts of films however his work here is a long way from his excellent work in The Mechanik and a country mile behind his apex in Ronin. This is I'm afraid perhaps the dullest film I have seen in years. I like Chuck and it's a shame this couldn't be a great swansong for the legend but as it goes I'll have to whip out a copy of Delta Force or Lone Wolf McQuade and watch in his prime. ".

Now even though this isn't a bad film and it certainly has some suspense and action there really isn't anything here to differentiate it from a host of other films in this genre. Chuck Norris is his usual bland self who gives his standard vanilla performance. Likewise both Joanna Pacula and Daniel Bernhardt as the the bad guyDirk perform adequately as well. And while Tracy Scoggins Alena is also in this film her part was limited and this fact adds another reason for the lackluster final product. That said if a person is looking for an average action film then this is certainly something they should consider.".

The movie should be a nostringsattached action flick and because it doesn't succeed at that I can't help but be let down by it.The plot An old diamond cutter named Isaac Bernie Kopell gets kidnapped by Dirk Daniel Bernhardt and he is put in a cell to cut a centuriesold diamond. John Shepard Norris is the detective who has to save him. The problem with the movie is that it tries too hard. There's some dialogue and situations involving the holocaust that hurt the flow of the movie. It's distracting. The movie's heart is the right place though.Chuck Norris does a decent job with the material he's given but basically he's coasting. What Norris does excel at is his martial arts. I put that in quotes because we all know he's pretty lame but when you see it it's still kind of exciting. There are two good fights in the film The one on the bus and the end fight. The only problem is that the action is cut too fast to see but you can make out Norris and not a stunt double most of the time.The movie in a nutshell It's a 90 minute Walker Texas Ranger episode with more explosions.For more insanity please visit comeuppancereviews.com".

Bowling Coach Shlomoe The Tranny Granny Running Bear not only brings the smugglers to justice but also triumphs over her own pain depression and fashion shortcomings.To make it easy for you this film is a sort of synthesis of films like Mean Girls The Hot Chick Ghost World and Requiem for a Dream with an added liberal dose of martial arts transvestitism Deth Metal and marionettes. The soundtrack and score are a wonderful collaboration between Faith Hill and Goblin.But it's Norris' performance as highschool Goth girl Tiffany Neversmile that elevates this far above the level of the usual teenage melodrama. His legs skinny birdlike and thankfully shaven promote the illusion that Chuck Norris is a little girl. Chuck keeps the beard for the role and I think it only helps since Norris as a woman possesses an unearthly beauty and the whiskers help to ground it.

If you missed that he stared in about 20 films from the late 70s to early 90s. Then he had the long running TV show Walker Texas Ranger. In 2005 he made his final movie this is that movie. Its pretty good for a 65 year old action star who is given one of the worst scripts of all time. Spoilers Below Chuck Norris is a private investigator who specializes in missing persons cases. A girls uncle gets kidnapped by neo Nazis to cut two demands of religious significance to the Jewish people he is Jewish and what a victim of the Holocost Chuck Norris finds him and kills Nazis. Thats about it. The acting is decent the dialog is bad the story has loopholes big enough to drive a semi truck through. But at the end of the day its good cheep fun. I got it for five dollars and don't regret it in the least. I advise you do the same. I also apologize for any spelling mistakes.".

Frank Cash must now use all of his experience to find out the truth as he delves deeper into this world of corruption murder sex drugs and rock  roll. The debut feature from director Wayne Dudley is a startling look at contemporary pop culture and at the hidden persuaders all around us dictating what we like buy and consume...whether we realize it or not.";

But very few people know about it because official Soviet historians tried hard to distort and downplay the events. I think Once Upon a Time There Lived a Simple Woman    movie is the only attempt to tell the true story to a wide audience.On the other hand while Tambov rebellion is the reason for this movie to exist we barely see the rebellion itself. Instead the movie tells the story of Russian peasant woman baba between 1909 and 1921 who happened to be living through it. And this life story is meticulously made. You could see the crew spent a lot of time making sure costumes language manners are as close to the period as possible. It's a unique ethnographic work. You could feel you are there.I hugely disagree with the other commentator who didn't like dirt lust and sluts. Regarding dirt I think the commentator has never been even to modern peasant village in Russia especially one without asphalt roads. I also disagree that the language peasants speak is an awful pseudoaccent. I guess the commentator simply hasn't read classic Russian writers Ivan Bunin or Nikolai Leskov. In their works the so called pseudoaccent is the language peasants actually use. By the way Leskov's novel The Life of a Peasant Woman    which obviously influenced the movie name and idea confirms not only the language but also harsh brutality that could be surprising for a modern eye. Finally I haven't seen sluts in the movie. The heroine didn't even have sex before her marriage.For me the ethnographic part of the movie is enough to enjoy it even if the story was crap. But it's not. It's a heart breaking loveduringturbulenttimes story. Finally it's very close to historic reality. E.g. depicted barbaric violence Bolshevik used against civilians is well documented in numerous historic archive documents and memoirs.The movie made a long lasting impression on me. It's a masterpiece.Full disclosure I'm Russian and my greatgrandparents were violently deported during dekulakization  about 10 years after the events of the movie. This could obviously influence my opinion. But I still believe anyone even mildly interested in Russian history would be impressed by the movie.".

As you might remember it's when film director intentionally uses one of the delicate themes for his films. Violence war gore horror sex Blacks  everything seemed to be written and taped already. And some directors as Andrei Smirnov and the majority of his contemporaries in Russia loves to make films where they show Russia as a dirty archaic country and Russian people  as ugly mindless barbarians always drunk and lustful. This is what I have to call rusxploitation.Really it's a film of fantastic absurd level crazy to nonsense. There are no characters here to whom a viewer can feel somewhat of empathy. Just a bunch of stupid people run around in circles shouting shooting fighting and raping each other. It's a well premise for trash comedy but this film isn't positioned as such though altogether with Burnt by the Sun 2 and My Joy it should.Goddamnit I don't know how naive man should be to consider this garbage somewhat historical and it'salltrue! sort of film. The thing is with some respect to the details in the surroundings and elements of everyday life there are no middle tones here just black and white especially the first one. I'm glad I can't dive into sick imagination of the director because this abyss is something really dangerous.This is one shameful movie playing on the utter concentration of negative moments in the life of presoviet and soviet peasants. The main hook that this movie has is that it's filmed really good. Cinematography is colorful with decent attention to the details and the actors doing their job just fine. But the scenario is disgusting and untruthful to the maximum. The subject matter film's concept scenario and direction are beyond any critique. Dirty lampoon farce on Russia with stereotypical characters and allaround drinking and rolling in the hay both literally and not. I guess it will be great if in the end some polar bears appeared and ate all these disgusting characters and film crew as well.Man I'm one of the most peaceful guys you could ever possibly met but watching this made me wanna throw nuclear bomb on this crapworld of the movie. If author wanted to create a world to hate he prevailed for sure. For any other reason imaginable  this is one big fail. Step over this useless phobic flick and move on. Oh yeah and screw this awful pseudoaccent even the descendants of the people that lived there say that their ancestors didn't talk like this.Ignore this awful farce it's worthless although spectacular. But if you are into stereotypes about Russia as a country of drunks thieves and sluts go ahead it won't disappoint you. But not for the thinking people anyhow.".

The thing is with some respect to the details in the surroundings and elements of everyday life there are no middle tones here just black and white especially the first one. I'm glad I can't dive into sick imagination of the director because this abyss is something really dangerous.This is one shameful movie playing on the utter concentration of negative moments in the life of presoviet and soviet peasants. The main hook that this movie has is that it's filmed really good. Cinematography is colorful with decent attention to the details and the actors doing their job just fine. But the scenario is disgusting and untruthful to the maximum. The subject matter film's concept scenario and direction are beyond any critique. Dirty lampoon farce on Russia with stereotypical characters and allaround drinking and rolling in the hay both literally and not. I guess it will be great if in the end some polar bears appeared and ate all these disgusting characters and film crew as well.Man I'm one of the most peaceful guys you could ever possibly met but watching this made me wanna throw nuclear bomb on this crapworld of the movie. If author wanted to create a world to hate he prevailed for sure. For any other reason imaginable  this is one big fail. Step over this useless phobic flick and move on. Oh yeah and screw this awful pseudoaccent even the descendants of the people that lived there say that their ancestors didn't talk like this.Ignore this awful farce it's worthless although spectacular. But if you are into stereotypes about Russia as a country of drunks thieves and sluts go ahead it won't disappoint you. But not for the thinking people anyhow.";

He almost gets on top of it all... almost when his world grips him by the gonads as never before. And everybody lives unhappily ever after! Some have said the movie has no meaning every one is bad. But that isn't true. Much like The Talented Mr Ripley does this movie shows that dishonesty will ultimately be repaid many times over with grief.My favorite line was right before the best fight scene I think I've seen. Scumbag says to Johnson's character So you think you're the tough guy. Johnson's character replies No you're the tough guy. I'm much worse than that. Then obviously trained as a fighter proceeded to beat the living snot out of the scumbag which was fully deserved. I had the movie on tape so I watched that scene several times.All in all a good movie and a credible job by director Hopper.

It's pure entertainment from start to finish  with bad boy Don Johnson looking gorgeous bad girl Virginia Madsen looking gorgeous and good girl Jennifer Connelly looking gorgeous.This film is worth watching for the eye candy alone  but as it turns out it has a whole lot more going for it. There are twists and turns aplenty lots of saucy dialog an evil woman ankling around plotting a dastardly villain doing slimy underhanded things passionate makingout and even some topless scenes.It's hot in Texas you can see the heat shimmering in the heavy air as Harry Maddox Don Johnson makes his way to a small town. Once there he brazenly strolls over to a car lot and sells a customer who was just about to leave an automobile.George Harshaw Jerry Hardin is the owner of the car lot and he's short a salesman so despite Harry's smartmouthed attitude he takes him on.Soon George's dissatisfied loony oversexed and sexy blond wife Dolly Virginia Madsen is taking Harry on as well! The gal who really attracts Harry's attentions however is a troubled young woman Gloria Harper Jennifer Connelly. Jennifer Connelly's long dark hair was to die for in this film. She looks very sweet and lovely  and has one heck of a figure! Gloria is in the slimy clutches of loser Frank Sutton William Sadlerwho reminded me quite a lot of Jerry Reed. It's a while before Harry finds out just what Frank has on Gloria.In the meantime Harry has plots of his own afoot  mainly robbing the town bank! The ending was especially surprising to me. Although why a woman would want to marry a man who hated her so much he'd like to kill her with his bare hands I can't imagine even a man as sexy and handsome as Don Johnson.8 stars out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "The hot shot not to be confused with the hot spot which is locatedwell on the person of Dolly Harshaw as you'll see is Harry Madox Don Johnson who has just arrived in Podunk Texas. What he's hot about is selling used cars and bedding floosies. He scans the small town scene to see what's available. He's a hunk with a gift of the macho and an ability to move clunkers off the lot. What he finds is the used car lot of George Harshaw Jerry Hardin in need of a salesman. George has a bad heart and a young and sexy wife the aforementioned Dolly Harshaw Virginia Madsen who once played in a movie called Zombie High or The High School that Ate My Brain. She's a woman who always gets what she wants and once she sets her rapacious eyes on Harry Harry is what she wants.Harry has other plans however. There's this bank in town that he just happens into as there's a fire going down the street. The bank is wide open and there's nobody there but this blind old black guy and the bank manager. Seems that the surveillance system isn't working and what's more all the tellers are off fighting the fire because they all belong to the volunteer fire department. This gives Harry ideas.One more complication. Doing the books for George is Gloria Harper Jennifer Connelly at 19 looking about as tasty as pie a la mode and as ripe as a peach about to fall off the tree. Harry soon discovers that she is as sweet as Tupelo honey and nearly as innocent as a small town girl can be with one strange problem. It seems that a country degenerate named Frank Sutton William Sadler has got some kind of hold on her.So what we have here is a setting for film noir circa 1990 done up in color with a lot of upper body and tail end nudity and plenty of steamy sex. Will Harry pull off the bank job and retire to the Caribbean? Or will he put on George's shoes and service the very serviceable Mrs. H? Or will he succumb to the charms of Gloria? Or will he end up afoul of the local law or meet foul play at the hands of Frank Sutton? Stay tuned. I know I did even though this is not exactly a masterpiece.Top three reasons to see this diversion are 1 Virginia Madsen who is as hot as the barrel of an AK47 as it unloads with a mind devious enough to delight the devil himself.2 Jennifer Connelly who is pretty enough to awaken the libido of the dead.3 The nice twist at the end in which we learn that life has a certain perverse logic to it proving that the hero may not get what he wants but hey things could be worse.I guess I should also mention the direction of Dennis Hopper who has garnered over 200 film credits in a career going back to the fifties. Can you believe he played in the classic teen angst film Rebel Without a Cause from 1955? Here he just panders shamelessly to the prurient interest of the audience while moving the action along at a spritely pace.One problem for today's sophisticated viewer beware of being overcome with a constant stream of cigarette smoke. I mean did the tobacco industry front the cash for this?Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!".

Virginia Madsen is perfect as the lusty vampish seductress who is BY FAR the most clever character.

Ahhh Jennifer Connelly is the dreamy innocent object of desire for Don and all male viewers!.  My only regret with Jennifer is that she has worn entirely too much makeup in every role since.  Wonderful turn by veteran character actor Barry Corbin as the sherriff. My tidbit from this one is that Virgil Frye Deputy Buck in the movie is the real life dad of TV's Punky Brewster. Also don't miss a 14 year old Jennifer Connelly as the young role of Elizabeth McGovern's character in the marvelous Sergio Leone film Once Upon a Time in America full length version ONLY.".

Johnson plays essentially the same character he played in Long Hot Summer a drifter who arrives in town and immediately skyrockets to the center of the action a likable but flawed character. Virginia Madsen is a devilish delight who wields an unquestionable unceasing power over Johnson again and again and again.... and again. Jennifer Connolly who looks about 17 years old but is saddled with troubles that would make a woman far beyond her years turn desperate is believable as the waifangel who so badly needs rescuing but struggles to overcome her past all by herself without anyone's interference or assistance. The interactions between herself and Johnson's character are exacting and intelligent where predictable notions of male protectionism and gallantry for gallantry's sake are happily absent. Instead their relationship proceeds with a fine edge of integrity and emotional honesty that makes you appreciate all the more the winorloseeverything situation in which they find themselves entwined. Dennis Hopper's directing shades the film in a vintage light that is appreciable even fifteen years after it was shot... the film seems a bit dated at first but then it seems more like it just aged well because the story is quite timeless. you know these people they are recognizable as the people you see every day on the street in any southern hamlet. as i said Faulknerian.".

The Hot Spot based on Nona Tyson's novel and with a screen play by Charles Williams seems to be the kind of project that would attract him. In fact he almost succeeds in making a remarkable movie but he should have tried some badly needed editing to tighten up this tale about crime and revenge in Texas.The Hot Spot will reward fans of Mr. Hooper. He shows he can make a bland actor like Don Johnson appear better and give a somewhat interesting performance as Henry Madox the drifter who appears out of nowhere and who we know is up to no good.Henry's good looks is a magnet for the two women in the story. One is the beautiful and somewhat naive Gloria Harper who works for the used car dealer George Harshaw. George's wife the sultry Dolly also has plans for the hunk now working for her husband. It's clear this triangle will get into knowing one another in more ways than social acquaintances.What Dennis Hopper accomplished in this film was to get excellent performances from his principal actors. Virginia Madsen notably is seen as the vamp that knows how to get what she wants all the time. Jennifer Connelly underplays Gloria Harper. Don Johnson is likable in one of the best things he has done in films. William Sadler is perfectly creepy as the black mailer. Veterans Jerry Hardin Barry Corbin and Jack Nance are also good.The moody musical score by Jack Nitzche serves the film well. Dennis Hopper achieves in presenting this moody tale with his inspired direction if only he could have trimmed it a little bit.

	schema:reviewBody "The Hot Spot is an immensely entertaining modern film noir thriller which is rich in style atmosphere and authenticity. These impressive qualities no doubt stem from the fact that it's directed by Dennis Hopper whose genuine affinity for this type of material is obvious and also the fact that the original screenplay which was adapted from Charles Williams' book Hell Hath No Fury was written by Williams and Nona Tyson back in 1962. Ueli Steiger's photography and a tremendous soundtrack featuring such luminaries as John Lee Hooker Miles Davis and Taj Mahal also make very significant contributions to the look and mood of the piece.The movie's characters include all the familiar noir archetypes and also many of the expected themes such as murder blackmail double crosses and robbery. The plot takes a number of interesting twists and turns and in keeping with the time in which it was made the sex and violence are considerably more explicit than would have been possible during the heyday of film noir. The presence of extreme heat is also a consistent feature throughout the film. Desert scenes perspiration two major fires in a small town and scenes where the shimmering heat rises from ground level are just some examples of how it's represented visually but the hot blooded nature of some of the characters and their steamy affairs also serve to reinforce the power of the theme.Harry Madox Don Johnson is a drifter who arrives in a small Texas town during sizzling hot weather and is soon attracted by the sight of a good looking young woman who he follows to a used car lot. There he takes a job as a salesman and gradually gets to know Gloria Harper Jennifer Connelly who is the bookkeeper at Harshaw Motors. She appears to be rather reserved and naive but something that happens when they go together to deal with a potential repossession case convinces him that she's hiding something.Gloria isn't the only attraction in town that he finds irresistible as there's also the local bank and Dolly Harshaw Virginia Madsen who is his boss' wife. The bank doesn't have a functioning security system and is staffed by parttime firemen who leave the property unattended each time they get a call out. Harry sets a building on fire robs the bank and then bravely rescues a man who's trapped in the burning building and thereby provides himself with an alibi.Harry initially tries to resist Dolly's less than subtle advances but is soon lured into a torrid and dangerous affair with her. At the same time he continues his relationship with Gloria who's the girl he wants to settle down with permanently. He discovers that she's being blackmailed and resolves that problem violently but another problem created by Dolly proves to be insurmountable.Don Johnson gives a particularly understated performance as the deeply cynical and self serving Harry who believes that in this life you've got to take what you want damn sure can't stand around and wait for somebody to give it to you. He also seems bitter and agitated at times and says that life's just been a succession of jams over floozies. He immediately fell for Gloria and saw a better future for himself with her but when Harry met Dolly what followed led him to reflect that I found my level and now I'm livin' it.Virginia Madsen is sensational as the sultry shameless and seductive femme fatale who is incredibly manipulative and on one occasion literally uses sex as a murder weapon. Jennifer Connelly's facial expressions convey her character's combination of innocence fear and sadness very convincingly and the remainder of the cast also provide good support with some colourful and eccentric performances. The best of these come from William Sadler who plays a despicable blackmailer and Jack Nance who excels as the lecherous heavy drinking banker.".

One odd reference is the repeated name of Michael Ovitz throughout the movie.  It appears in the song I Wanna Be Michael Ovitz in the soundtrack there's a Paging Dr. Ovitz... in the background in a hospital etc.  It's not quite clear what writer Eszterhas's feelings toward Ovitz are  does he hate him or look up to him?Another thing I don't understand is why director Arthur Hiller felt he had to change his credit to Alan Smithee except that it's amusingly appropriate.  Looking at the film I can't imagine that it was changed too radically in the editing except  perhaps the ultraacidic putdowns on the title cards that introduce new characters.".

Ryan O'Neal is great as an amoral producer. Eric Idle is even better as an unfortunate director named Alan Smithee whose movie is corrupted by the studio. He wants to remove his name from the movie but since Alan Smithee is the pseudonym used for directors who want to remove their name from a picture he is out of luck and becomes... unbalanced. Very dry but very amusing. If you liked Last Action Hero and Purple Rose of Cairo you'll probably like this.".

The movie has an odd flow to it is that bad? which I found cool. I Don't see why people can praise films like Memento which told a story in an unconventional way just like Burn or Spinal Tap which has no real plot just like Burn and not give this movie and at least average review. If you can find it watch it and decide for yourself don't take the word of these flakers and perpetrators.".

However when the producer's final cut leaves it in Alan's opinion a mess he steals the master negative and runs.  This documentary follows the story of what happens when a director is forced to watch his art turned into a poor money spinner.I hadn't really read the very negative reviews of this film before I watched it and am a little surprised by the strength of feeling from the majority of the critics.  Having said that I can understand why this film is so hammered  as it really isn't very good.  It started well and I thought it had potential  it seemed that people were making fun of themselves and that it would be a good satire on the industry and in particular studio execs. However after a certain point it doesn't really do very much other than be flabby repeating self indulgent and silly.  After Alan actually takes his film and seeks refuge with the Brothers Brothers the film is very messy and not very funny at all.  The documentary approach had worked well up till this point but from here it was a strange mix of action and documentary.  It gets increasingly silly and increasingly less clever and funny.It had a few laughs but satire is meant to be funny  not just taking easy pot shots with crude characterisations and jokes.  I still maintain it had potential but it is a good idea crying out for a better script and director I notice it is directed by Smithee  I don't know if that's a joke or if the real director really did disown it.  So from a good idea it goes nowhere  the little touches are nice but the total plot is rubbish.  In away it is both made worse and more bearable by the actors who are a mixed bunch.Eric Idol is awful and he simply doesn't suit the material  watch the scene where he turns his hat sideways and says cool' and you'll see what I mean. Chuck D should really have known better than to deliver a meaningless performance here  although I totally expect that from Coolio!  However Stallone Goldberg and Chan are all quite funny and make fun of themselves quite well.  O'Neal and colleague as the producers are quite good but are dumbly stretched to extremes for the sake of humour.  For the majority of the cast there seems to be a problem gelling  it feels like every single person thinks they are in a cameo and thus add to the feeling of this not being a film so much as a cobbled together affair.  The support cast is good for names but the quality of delivery isn't really that high.Overall I'd stop short of adding to the list of boots that have been put into this film but I'd be lying if I told you I didn't feel like I'd waste 90 minutes  I do.  It started with a good idea but the script was nowhere near sharp enough and the majority of the cast certainly those required to carry the film and not just be cameos are just not up to the job.  Could have been a fun satire but instead is an unfunny messy affair that doesn't really have anywhere to go beyond taking easy shots at the producers.".

But somewhere between that first reading and the film's release someone surely must have sobered up and noticed just how badly this film fails to deliver.

Obviously everyone thought they were making a pretty good movie. In the end the film is smart and pointed and even insightful but it is never never never never even remotely funny. It is hard to pinpoint just why the film ends up being so depressingly blah but a good guess would be that it is a matter of attitude. ALAN SMITHEE is just so insultingly smug. Everybody involved is basically making fun of themselves but not in jovial lighthearted way. The selfdeprecation is condescending See they all seem to be saying I called myself a bastard before you had a chance. Nyah nyah nyah!!! I beat you to the punch. I mean what is the point of self mockery if it is intended to belittle someone else? Even the most meanspirited of satires require a degree of innocence a posture that allows the audience to find the humor and the hypocrisy for themselves rather than to have it force fed to them. For instance the film's structure basically a series of talking head interviews demands that the interview blurbs seem spontaneous not preprocessed and rehearsed. Hiller skillful stages these little snatches of interviews as though they are being given on the fly in different places and at different times but they still seem canned. Even the characters' insincerity should seem sincerely insincere not like tossedoff oneliners at a Friars Club roast. Even though everyone involved is obviously in on the joke they shouldn't appear to be. And a major inexplicable problem is the whole black thing the film seems to be doing. This is a satire about a British director and bunch of Beverly Hillsmovie studio suits so why does the film feature rap music AfricanAmerican themed title credits and references to black directors? Is black cinema supposed to be the new New Wave or avantgarde? Is it supposed to be like references to beatniks in the fifties and hippies in the sixties a clumsy attempt to make the squares seem hip and to make the story seem relevant when ultimately it will only make the film seem quickly dated? The film can't fake sincerity why do the filmmakers think they can fake soul? In the end ALAN SMITHEE seems to be little more than a home movie a gag reel to be played at the office Christmas party. If that were the case I suspect that all involved would still find the material funny.

The plot is practically nonexistent the dialogue is lame the acting pretty crummy and the direction uninspired.The result an extremely boring tedious pointless mess. This film has no reason to exist. It offers no real insight into the studio system. It was made just so Joe could badmouth the studio execs who were presumely mean to him.

The plot is practically nonexistent the dialogue is lame the acting pretty crummy and the direction uninspired.The result an extremely boring tedious pointless mess. This film has no reason to exist. It offers no real insight into the studio system. It was made just so Joe could badmouth the studio execs who were presumely mean to him.

If you are looking for a great action movie with big stars then the joke is on you. This is maybe the most realist portrail of how the movie business works maybe that's why people don't like this movie because it takes all the magic out it and shows how the public is completely played by the movie companies people don't like it when a movie shows how easily the general public is manipulated. Much like another movie everybody hated the last action hero cars don't blow up when you shoot them chances are you'll break your hand trying to punch your way through a windshield etc..I laughed all the way though this movie from the first 5 seconds till the end When I realized I had been duped. Maybe americans can't get it but I guess I was lucky. This is Ryan O' Neil's best role in years and Coolio and Chuck D are perfect as the Brother Brothers Cosacks Richard Jeni is classic. Its amazing the movie ever got madenot because it's bad but because it shows the blatant prostitution of the movie business.This is a comedy and you are the jokerelax and laugh     at yourself".

Much like another movie everybody hated the last action hero cars don't blow up when you shoot them chances are you'll break your hand trying to punch your way through a windshield etc..I laughed all the way though this movie from the first 5 seconds till the end When I realized I had been duped. Maybe americans can't get it but I guess I was lucky. This is Ryan O' Neil's best role in years and Coolio and Chuck D are perfect as the Brother Brothers Cosacks Richard Jeni is classic. Its amazing the movie ever got madenot because it's bad but because it shows the blatant prostitution of the movie business.This is a comedy and you are the jokerelax and laugh     at yourself";

It's something that is influential for all people who watch movies in the theaters on cable video dvd or wherever. Don't ever forget that this is a medium that covers the entire world. So what this film has to say in an very pleasing and entertaining way is that there are as in any other business some problems. No one shines better or is a more interesting part of this film than Ryan O'Neal. He plays his part with total authenticity. You should look for that. So many top directors respect O'Neal's acting skills that you should notice here. Kubrick once said to me that Ryan was the the best actor he'd ever cast in a role i.e. Barry Lyndon and he told me that before Ryan had even finished the film. Kubrick considered O'Neal a master at his craft. And Peter Bogdanovich's film editor Verna Fields who edited many of his Oscarnominated films including Paper Moon told me that Ryan was a perfect actor because he was so able to adapt to whatever was asked of him. She won an Oscar for Jaws and when I talked to her later she said that Barry Lyndon belonged in the Louvre museum in Paris.While O'Neal was a major film star for his elegant looks he was far more than that in the eyes of the creative people who made films withhim. He's an actor's actor a director's actor and he is not even remotely a person about whom we should speak in the past tense. He hasa disease and we all know people who do. I predict that if his film with Pacino doesn't merit an Oscar nomination one will soon.Ryan O'Neal has the heart of a fighter. He will always have the heart of a figher. And I guarantee you this is one fight he will win.S. Jaffe".

	schema:reviewBody "Unfortunately this film is not yet released as an original DVD and I saw it in a DVDR as copied from TV. I found it delightful and charming a light and witty comedy in the European tradition. It is about English students of french in a boarding school in France. We have therefore the English sense of humor set against the french mentality resulting in hilarious situations . The sister of one of the students arrives a very beautiful girl and a terrible flirt that becomes the love interest for almost everyone except the one she really wants. The dialogs by T.Rattigan are very clever and refreshing the direction of A.Asquith discreet never overwhelming or pompous and the special touch of the editor David Lean is evident throughout but especially in the scene of the carnival dance. All the actors are very good in the various characters they portray. Ellen Drew is both a doll with fairytale princess eyes and exactly as she should be for her role. Ray Milland is as natural and as astonishing in this English type comedy as he is in the American screwball comedy Easy Living etc plus so handsome and so sexy once again a treat for our eyes!! This film is perfect without fanfares and exaggerations and every time I watch it it invariably makes me feel good....".

	schema:reviewBody "After watching the Terence Rattigan DVD collection with most of the adaptations being from the 70s and 80s when staying with family friends last year Rattigan very quickly became one of my favourite playwrights and he still is. His dialogue is so intelligent witty and meaty his characterisation so dynamic complex and real and the storytelling so beautifully constructed.'French Without Tears' Rattigan's first successful play is not my favourite of Rattigan's plays or one of them. Do prefer 'The Winslow Boy' 'Separate Tables' and particularly 'The Browning Version' myself. Despite the story being flimsier than those three and it doesn't lend itself as well to more cinematic film adaptations faring much better to me with a live audience the light as souffl and mostly quite sophisticated comedy and the meat of the writing and characterisation still remains.While not one of the best film adaptations of Terence Rattigan about this 'French Without Tears' is a highly enjoyable and criminally underseen version of the play. Is the story fluffy and on the flimsy side? Sure but it is also one of the more accessible stories of Rattigan's work subject matterwise. Is it old fashioned? In a way though modern audiences probably would get into it easily knowing what to expect. Does 'French Without Tears' work better on stage with a live audience? To me it does. Does that mean that it doesn't work at all as a film? Of course not but other Rattigan plays fare better on cinematic terms judging from director Anthony Asquith's later Rattigan film adaptations 'The Browning Version' and 'The Winslow Boy' both even better for example.This film of 'French Without Tears' looks lovely with suitably intimate and beautifully composed photography and sumptuous costumes and sets. The star in this regard is David Lean's yes that David Lean before he went on to even greater things editing especially in the carnival scene. The music is energetic and is pleasantly orchestrated.Furthermore the script does capture the play's wit and zest not all but for stagetofilm translations enough of it does do Rattigan's gift for light humour writing that provokes thought and a darkly painful side which brings complexity and dimension to the subject matter and his attention to meaty characterisation still shines even if the story still feels flimsy the humour sparkling and as light as a souflee and other parts are very sophisticated.Charm heart and zest is all over 'French Without Tears' which flies by and while it is a very short film just over an hour one wishes a little when it's over that there was more. The highlight is the drunk scene which is hilarious. Asquith does a great job directing very assured while understanding the intimacy of the relationship between dialogue camera and acting.Of the splendid cast Ray Milland and Roland Culver both on very natural sparkling form are the standouts. Ellen Drew is very charming one can totally see what the characters see in her.In summation hugely enjoyable and should be made available on DVD. 810 Bethany Cox".

	schema:headline " Wyatt Earp cleans up Tombstone";
	schema:reviewBody "MY DARLING CLEMENTINE  rating      out of 5 Adapted from the book 'Wyatt Earp Frontier Marshal' by Stuart N. Lake writers Samuel G. Engel Winston Miller and Sam Hellman and the great director himself John Ford offer this most atmospheric depiction of Wyatt Earp Doc Holliday and the most famous of shootouts in Western folklore.The story basically covers the period when Wyatt Earp cleaned up Tombstone and wiped out the Clanton gang at the OK Coral. This is timehonored stuff. Nostalgic dramatizations that romanticized the Wild West while creating unforgettable heroes and notorious villains.John Ford's handling of this motion picture is done with great care and obvious affection. Significant endeavor and attention to detail has gone into the period's reconstruction and the result is what can only be described as lyrical. A synchronous composition of sight and sound that produces a mesmerizing effect which in turn forces any viewer to fall instantly in love with this film.Henry Fonda's portrayal of Wyatt Earp is without doubt the best that has ever been attempted and Victor Mature's Doc Holliday has him in rare form. Add cast members Walter Brennan Linda Darnell Ward Bond and John Ireland and this film just crackles along.There is one interesting irony I have noted. In John Ford's celebrated history as a director particularly in the days when he was making silent films the real Wyatt Earp acted as Ford's technical adviser bringing a new level of authenticity to gun play that Hollywood in the past had only guessed at. But in 'My Darling Clementine' the final shootout although well done has a fantasylike quality about it that avoids a sense of violent realism and adopts a surreal quality  as if seen through a dream.Because John Ford knew all too well how to make a gunfight look believable maybe this film allowed him to go beyond what was expected and to produce something a little special and maybe it was shot in the way that Wyatt Earp wished it could have really happened. To successfully bend the rules it really helps to have written them in the first place.'My Darling Clementine' is a joy to behold. Sure there are a few moments when minor cracks appear but for pure entertainment value it is unsurpassed. This movie is what going to the pictures on a Saturday afternoon was all about  those delightful matinee sessions when you'd load your arms up with confectionery scramble for the best seats in the back row and experience the escapism that made growing up in the suburbs almost tolerable.".

	schema:headline " John Ford's Most Poetic View of the West...";
	schema:reviewBody "If you're looking for a straightforward fairly factual presentation of the events leading up to the 'Gunfight at the O.K. Corral' watch 'Wyatt Earp' or 'Tombstone'...But if you prefer your history more spiritual and want to see a master storyteller paint a visual canvas of a West that may never have existed but SHOULD have then this film should be a treasured part of your video collection!John Ford knew Wyatt Earp personally and was familiar with the events surrounding the Tombstone shootout but one of his greatest assets as a director was his ability to look beyond simple facts and focus on what 'made' a legend. 'My Darling Clementine' is a story of icons of Loners accepting their own weaknesses and limitations yet willing to risk their lives and abilities to aid others then to walk away allowing Civilization to grow. It's a classic theme of most great westerns particularly in Ford's work he would return to it in 'The Searchers' and 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance' as well as other directors 'Shane' 'A Fistful of Dollars' 'Unforgiven' and 'Open Range' are a few examples.Wyatt Earp wonderfully portrayed by Henry Fonda and his brothers have an aloofness that makes their characters both deceptively simple yet enigmatic at the same time. At the film's start Wyatt's a cowpuncher who had walked away from the responsibilities of being a lawman finding satisfaction with his brothers in the hard work and solitary life of the range. When the Clantons led by Walter Brennan in one of his greatest yet most vicious roles first approach the brothers on the range they accept the old man's invitation to get a taste of city life but it's clear that it will only be a brief stay before they move on and Wyatt brushes aside any overtures of friendship.Wyatt's lack of desire to commit to a larger community is stressed when he subdues an armed drunken Indian with his bare hands in a saloon based on an actual event in Earp's life then turns down the city council's plea to accept the Marshall's badge. Only after a brother is murdered do the Earp brothers decide to clean up the town as it had become 'personal'.In counterpoint to Earp is another 'loner' Doc Holliday sensitively portrayed by Victor Mature an intellectual who fled the South and had found his solitude through his guns his gambling and his illness. While Wyatt is a true 'Man of the West' however Holliday is simply a lonely man with no place to go only comfortable at a poker table. He is doomed more by his own shrinking world than by the disease that forces him to cough into his handkerchief.The scenes of Wyatt in Tombstone are wonderful as Civilization grows up around the uncomfortable stranger. Yet he toys with the idea of settling into this world through his polite yet obvious attraction to Doc's lost love Clementine. The scene of the outdoor church dance where the stiffly formal Earp dances against the vista of a West being 'boarded in' is symbolic of what his own life and the West itself was becoming and is classic Ford!The climactic shootout at the O.K. Corral is both powerful and raw ultimately fulfilling the Earps' commitment to a world that needed their aid and ending the downward spiral of Holliday's life in a heroic and theatrical gesture.It's often asked why Wyatt leaves afterward when Clementine and Tombstone are so attractive...The answer is simple really his work is finished and his participation was no longer necessary. Civilization could now grow unimpeded. The Loner would have no place there. Like Ethan or Shane or 'The Man With No Name' he must return to the solitary vistas that are his true home.John Ford has truly created the 'Stuff of Legends' with this beloved classic!".

	schema:reviewBody "Set amid the sweeping vistas and the towering sandstone buttes and spires of Monument Valley this John Ford film about Wyatt Earp Henry Fonda and his encounters with the Clanton gang in rowdy Tombstone Arizona fulfills our need to experience the Old West as mythic romanticism. The visuals are striking. El Greco skies oppress a majestic and lonesome landscape of rock dirt dust and cattle. Ghostly human figures confront death in heavy rain. Indoors small overhead lanterns emit soft light in tough barrooms. The BW cinematography conveys a somber moody idealized vision of the nineteenth century American frontier.But the film's romanticism is not just the product of adroit cinematography. The relaxed narrative weaves multiple seemingly insignificant plot lines into a unified whole and thus depicts the Old West as a place and time of humor wit religious faith amiable conflict even poetry and philosophy.And so in his heartfelt soliloquy of the undiscovered country Granville Thorndyke Alan Mowbray that congenial thespian rogue who quotes Shakespeare and who seems so out of place adds texture and soul to the script as a precursor to violence and death. This is after all ... Tombstone.Inspired by the real life gunfight at the OK Corral the story is less factual than suggestive. It's not just the film's fanciful portrayal of the shootout that abets credulity. It's the setting ... Tombstone is nowhere near Monument Valley.But this is not a textbook. It is a romanticized cinematic interpretation of a longago culture using a textbook incident as a premise. The film's theme centers on the nobility of outcasts and the basic goodness and humanism of frontier people. It's a broadbrush character study of historical figures like Doc Holliday Victor Mature Old Man Clanton Walter Brennan the Clanton sons and of course Wyatt Earp and his sons. Although one could argue that Fonda lacks the tough guy strength and roughness that we would expect for a frontier legend the casting and the acting are overall quite good. Editing costumes and production design also enhance the film's credibility.Understated and meditative in tone My Darling Clementine is a different kind of Hollywood western one that conveys a humanistic theme with emotional depth. Characters are multidimensional unvarnished and as striking and memorable as the stately buttes and spires of Monument Valley.".

	schema:reviewBody "Absolute perfection.  Without a doubt My Darling Clementine' has secured its place in film immortality resting proudly at the top of the list of the finest westerns ever made.  It represents the genre at its peak and the career high point of all involved including director John Ford and star Henry Fonda. Clementine' achieves the difficult blend of drama action romance and occasional comic relief necessary to appeal to all viewers.  This is the kind of film at which Ford excelled  straightforward and powerful sentimental but never maudlin.  It is needless to say that this is the definitive portrayal of Wyatt Earp and the gunfight at the OK Corral.  It may not be the grittiest most penetrating or historically accurate rendition but it mixes just the right quantities of realism legend and Hollywood magic. Its characterizations leave no room for improvement.  Henry Fonda was born to play Earp.  His folksy unpretentious demeanor coupled with the hard edge of a man who must occasionally deal out justice through the barrel of his gun produce a multidimensional performance that others approaching the role could only dream of.  With his portrayal of the tubercular Doc Holliday Victor Mature forever shed his light image and began a series of solid dramatic roles.  Other actors have played Holliday as flamboyant and eccentric but Mature is effective in approaching him as a fatalist who has relinquished his aspirations of greatness and now lives life one day at a time.  He forms an alliance with Earp because he has nothing better to do and nothing else to live for.  Walter Brennan's Old Man Clanton is a study in evil personified and will certainly shock viewers who know him only as the crotchety but lovable grandfather he played on so many occasions.  The rest of the cast is uniformly fine featuring many members of Ford's stock company' which followed him throughout his career. Ford's direction is strong and surefooted.  Although this was familiar territory for him he was careful to instill each scene with a certain degree of uniqueness so the film would never appear routine.  In this he was entirely successful and a brief glance at his filmography confirms that this holds true throughout his body of work.  The cinematography is breathtaking.  Vast outdoor imagery and intimate gatherings of people are conveyed in an equally compelling manner.  Earp's soliloquy at his brother's gravestone a church dance sequence and the gunfight itself are among the film's many highlights.  Only so much praise can be given in a review such as this it must be seen to be appreciated.".

	schema:headline " An archetypal Western mood piece!";
	schema:reviewBody "'My Darling Clementine' is easily one of Ford's best Westerns and quite certainly the best of all the Wyatt Earp films... To most modern audiences the Corral incident and the confused events and motivations which led to it have been best presented by two motion pictures John Ford's 'My Darling Clementine' and John Sturges' 'Gunfight at the O.K. Corral.'Ford makes a fine account of Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday's legendary defeat of the Clanton gang... By now despite the film's climactic shootout at the OK Corral Ford's talents lay less in action scenes than in playing endless variations on community rituals... Dances churchmeetings saloon brawls and funerals are utilized to define social hierarchies and relationships and to emphasize the role of tradition in the molding of America's heroic culture...Ford makes much of the visit of a pretty graceful lady named Clementine searching for her presumably longlost love none other than the consumptive Doc Holliday now devoted to the bottle and hidden under a huge white handkerchief...

	onyx:emotionText "'My Darling Clementine' is easily one of Ford's best Westerns and quite certainly the best of all the Wyatt Earp films... To most modern audiences the Corral incident and the confused events and motivations which led to it have been best presented by two motion pictures John Ford's 'My Darling Clementine' and John Sturges' 'Gunfight at the O.K. Corral.'Ford makes a fine account of Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday's legendary defeat of the Clanton gang... By now despite the film's climactic shootout at the OK Corral Ford's talents lay less in action scenes than in playing endless variations on community rituals... Dances churchmeetings saloon brawls and funerals are utilized to define social hierarchies and relationships and to emphasize the role of tradition in the molding of America's heroic culture...Ford makes much of the visit of a pretty graceful lady named Clementine searching for her presumably longlost love none other than the consumptive Doc Holliday now devoted to the bottle and hidden under a huge white handkerchief... Victor Mature gives a touchy performance as the wild and reckless Doc seeking death... Holliday sways between two kinds of women The Eastern fair and respectable Clementine Carter Cathy Downs and the wild darkeyed dancing girl 'Apache' Chihuahua Linda Darnell one of the sirens of the 1940s whose roseattwilight looks seem to stimulate every cameraman...

	schema:reviewBody "Wyatt Earp and his brothers are driving cattle to California.  They stop off at Tombstone and go into town leaving the youngest brother behind to mind the cattle.  On their return they find their brother murdered and their cattle stolen.  Wyatt decides to stay in town with his brother as the town's marshal to bring law and order and catch the murderer.  In the town he not only comes up against the harddrinking Doc Holliday but also the Clanton's.Easily the best film that tells the story of Wyatt Earp and the gunfight at the OK Coral.  There have been more action packed versions or more ponderous versions but this is still the best.  The shootout itself is supposedly the most accurate as director Ford said I talked to Wyatt Earp he told me how it was and that's how we did it' I'm paraphrasing cause I can't remember the direct quote.  However the shootout is not as dramatic as a result  in fact it is very short and straightforward.  The strength in the film is the wider story.  The story is well told with attention to character and has a good comic feel running right through it.The script allows for good dialogue and the actors bring it to life well. Fonda was always at his strongest in these type of roles and is morally strong.  His easy screen toughness really holds the attention.  Mature has a good role in Doc but is not the best doc ever I think.  The Clantons are all underused and don't really make a big impact until the final section. Darnell makes a big impact and Downs is good despite being more subtle.The film is as much Ford's as Fonda's.  His black and white film is as lush as many colour films you see.  His use of shadow is powerful  witness his death shroud on Holliday's face as he talks to Chihuahua who is literally and metaphorically entering into the light.  The old west looks as sparse as I imagine it was.  Ford's only weakness is that he doesn't bring much tension to the actual gunfight but his warming comic telling at other points means that his strengths vastly outweigh the odd weakness.Overall this film is rightly a classic that appears in many critics top 100 lists.  I was surprised to see it not in the top 250 of imdb at time of writing.  I guess that when modern films are good' hundreds of thousands of people see it and it moves quickly up the internet polls however older classics like this can tend to be forgotten as those same users slowly discover it.  However regardless of on line polls this is a very good film that is easily the best telling of the Wyatt Earp story.".

It would have been better to change names to create just a simple story about the wild west. It is in my opinion of no use at all to show history in falsifying history. I am a strong opponent to this. If history is too boring You need not make a film about it choose something else or relate a tale. That is much better. Compared with other westerns of the time this one is not very convincing. To locate Tombstone in the Monument Valley is not excusable. Ford did not care a penny for the ridicule he must have received from all the Arizona audience. But You have to respect the claims of people who live in the area where historic incidents happened. They claim more accuracy and they have the right to do this. Hollywood is of course not bound to facts or history but it is much more appreciated if they do not only make fantasy films when the reality is much more interesting.

Outdoor filming in open wide sceneries is fine as well.But how in the name of God could they cast Victor Mature as Doc Holiday I'll never understand. His usual and classical overoveracting literally damages the movie badly. His part is too important to overlook his terrible acting. This is not the first potential classic that Mature ruined with his performance other one is The Egyptian though he got a lot of help there from Edmund Purdom in the main role.And also how could a smart director like Ford include a scene where Fonda faces Mature in a gun duel and shoots Doc's gun right off his hand in the most pure Lone Ranger style? I must say too that the film is sortof slow but I admit this could be a matter of opinion.Don't get me wrong My Darling Clementine is a watchable western but no classic could have such flaws.

	schema:reviewBody "The movies sure do love telling and retelling the story of the OK Corral shootout. Most versions never do it with any degree of accuracy. This film is one of the least accurate but maybe one of the most poetic. That's almost a given when you consider John Ford directed it.My Darling Clementine is based on the book Stuart Lake wrote as an official biography of Wyatt Earp. A year or two before Earp died he gave a series of interviews to Stuart Lake and gave his version of his life. The book is a good account of all the events of Wyatt Earp's life his whole life as a frontier marshal before and after the OK Corral affair. Earp outlived just about all his contemporaries on the western scene so he got the final word in for the most part. There have been revisionist stuff done that show that the brothers Earp might not have been as noble as all that. But saying the Clantons and their satellites were any model citizens is just plain ridiculous.20th Century Fox bought the rights to the Lake book and made two other films entitled Frontier Marshal in 1934 and 1939 starring George O'Brien and Randolph Scott respectively. Basically they bought the rights to the Earp myth because none of this is in My Darling Clementine. Note also those are the ONLY Wyatt Earp films that are credited to the Lake authorized biography.The myth of Earp is so overwhelming that you can't play it any other way but noble. Henry Fonda is certainly no exception here. But it's a good portrayal of the cowboy hero. Doc Holiday is always the character that is most complex and Victor Mature does well by Holiday. He's a surgeon here not a dentist as in real life and part of the plot calls on him to operate on his girl friend Chihuahua played by Linda Darnell. Her death is what compels him to join the Earps in their meeting with the Clantons.The best acted role in this film belongs to Walter Brennan as Old Man Clanton. In real life Old Man Clanton was killed several months before the OK Corral gunfight but Brennan is fascinating as one evil human being. His portrayal of the Clanton patriarch makes his Academy Award winning Roy Bean in The Westerner look like Mary Poppins.John Ford got a great performance from Brennan but it was the one and only time they ever worked together. Brennan refused to ever work for him after that. Ford could be a bully on the set and sometimes downright sadistic. Some actors took to him some didn't and Brennan with Academy Awards under his belt felt he didn't have to.I've seen My Darling Clementine dozens of times but I still jump when Brennan kills Virgil Earp played by Tim Holt by shooting him in the back. Actually the scene as great as it is shows one weakness in the screenplay. Virgil Earp would NEVER have ridden up to the Clanton ranch alone as he did he was an experienced peace officer in his own right. But when Brennan takes that shotgun from under the blanket draped over his lap and shoots as Holt is leaving I guarantee you will jump with fright. It's a great cinematic moment but Ford should have had a better premise leading up to it.My Darling Clementine is a wonderful poetic retelling of the great western myth about the OK Corral a great classic western.".

Well......more than doubts...but are ANY of the versions really true? Probably not so you just enjoy each film for what it offers.Henry Fonda makes a good Earp but Victor Mature as Holliday doesn't fit. In re makes we saw Val Kilmer and Dennis Quaid do far better in the role. Walter Brennan however was very good as the nasty father of the Clanton family. Too bad he didn't have a bigger role. The female lead in the movie was played by Cathy Downs a wholesomelybeautiful woman. I am surprised she never amounted to making more than noname films after this one.Once again director John Ford returns to his favorite location Monument Valley and provides us with some memorable panoramic scenes of that area particularly in the beginning of the film.The DVD has the film version that was not seen in theaters. This version is 10 minutes longer showing footage that was cut by studio head Daryl Zanuck. It didn't make much of a difference. In fact if anything the film lags in a few spots with this longer version but it's nice to have the complete package.".

I'm a fan of Henry Fonda I love earlier black and white films I've enjoyed some of John Ford's movies and the Western genre is one of my favorites. But this is nothing more to me than a historically inaccurate and tedious soap opera.Historical inaccuracies abound for the sake of that melodramatic brand of Hollywood script which is what truly dates movies like this one as opposed to timeless classics such as say The Third Man. When the movie begins with the murder of James Earp who actually died in 1926! and introduces silly fictional female characters like Chihuahua and Clementine Carter who chew up large chunks of screen time with ridiculous dialog you know you're going to get the worst that that dated Hollywood treatment can offer.It doesn't help that the Earps who never raised cattle are seen driving a herd. Worse they are suppose to be doing so in Arizona yet looming strangely in the background is one of the most easily recognizable of U.S. geographical landmarks Devil's Tower in Wyoming!The historical inaccuracies are so outrageous I found myself laughing at several points during the story that were intended to be moments of high drama. That includes the shooting of Virgil Earp  who actually died from pneumonia over twenty years later  by Old Man Clanton who actually died BEFORE the time period depicted in this film! It also includes the death of Doc Holliday at the OK Corral  which also never happened of course  but given the wooden acting of the miscast Victor Mature any inaccuracy that had his character prematurely exiting the story can be easily forgiven.Harder to forgive is the fact that the real history of the Earps is far more interesting than this pap and especially given the fact that director Ford was supposed to have extensively interviewed the real Wyatt Earp years earlier. Truthfully what is factually accurate in this film is a much shorter list than the reverse...or if I may borrow and edit a line from Shattered Glass there does appear to be a state in the union named Arizona.Summing up to say this is overrated is an UNDERstatement.P.S. I've always hated that Darling Clementine song.P.P.S. Henry Fonda should receive a special posthumous Oscar for Worst Cowboy Hat in the Entire History of Western Film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Exciting classy Western with plenty of tension  thrills  shoot'em up  high bodycount and it has now become accepted as a classic of the genre .This is a vigorous recounting of a familiar tale  dealing with the legendary lawman from Dodge City who moves to Tombstone  Arizona  aiming to begin a new life along with his brothers  Virgil Tim Holt and Morgan Ward Bond . This triggertaut Western drama deals with a lawman Wyatt Earp  at the begining Wyatt is a cowboy  a nomadic savage transporting his cattle and he subsequently befriends a badman gunslinger and philosopher Southern gent who usually coughs  called Doc Holliday  Victor Mature who excels  giving comsumptive conviction to character  the strangest friendship this side of heaven and hell . They fought shoulder to shoulder in the wildest standup gunfight in the history of the West . As the fabled showdown is seen at the final way through this film . They are the strangest alliance between the West's most famous sheriff Wyatt Earp  trying to overcome outlaws and his deadliest gambling killer  Doc Holliday. It's incomparably performed by the greatest team who ever went into action  Henry Fonda portrays the largethanlife lawman  living by the old rules  driven by revenge  dueling to the death and Mature is most impressive as a gunslinger  the hellfire gambler  his only friends were his guns and his only refuge was a woman's heart  Chihuahua Linda Darnell . Two towering Box office actors in a huge exciting production . The film correctly builds up its suspense until a tense battle in streets of Tombstone  it is the highlight to the story .The Roaring West At Its Reckless Best! . Reckless Riotous Frontier Adventure! . She was everything the West was  young fiery exciting.This is an overwhelming Western  though too selfconscious  as the death of an intimate brother results to be the start of a small war between the revenger Earp and the baddies . As when a beloved sibling is murdered it marks the turning point of Wyatt's transition from a wandering cowboy  to bent on vendetta  settled  civilised  and the Marshall who administers the law . Based on a story by Sam Hellman from a book by Stuart N. Lake . In fact  it was the third adaptation  1 was  Frontier Marshal 1934 and second  1939 Frontier Marshal by Allan Dwan . It was partially panned and by no means acclaimed in its day  but nowadays  being well considered  may be seen by some as unoriginal and cliched but is really a very fashionable outing in Earp saga and a throughly agreeable Western . The movie's enjoyability  authenticity  and greatness rests not only in the accuracy of the ending gunplay  but in the well orchestred series of incidents  such as  Earp's visit to barber shop  the dance in the unfinished church  Fonda 's poker game  the romantic scenes between Fonda and Cathy Dows  all of them give a deep meaning to this spledid picture . Decorated by import themes of camaraderie  brothership  fidelity  family and action that were to dominate Ford films for the first postII world war decade as never before . Victor Mature coming up trumps as Holliday  he delivers a surprisingly awesome acting  stealing clearly the show  a character designed for scenary chewing  giving an attractive portrayal of the doomed dentist . Although overlong  but blessed with a highenergy level  thanks to noisy action  spectacular horse riding and rousing shooting . As the picture benefits itself from despictable villians as Walter Brennan as epitome of evil as Old Man Clanton  he is accompanied by his sons  Grant Whiters and John Ireland is again on the side of Clanton's family just like he was 10 years later in Gunfight at OK Corral. The film focuses Tombstone  1881  with stimulating scenes about OK Corral gunfight between Morgan  Virgil  Wyatt Earp  Doc against the nefarious old Clanton  Ike  Billy Clanton and other brothers . It is good enough to form the main axis of several other sturdy western films. This main character is a historical figure  in this case the sheriff Wyatt Earp who participated the most famous duel occurred in the western town of Tombstone in 1881 that has been brought to the big screen many times as in this classic My Darling Clementine in 1946 directed by John Ford  in Gunfight at O.K. Corral 1957 with Burt Lancaster  Kirk Douglas directed by specialist John Sturges who would resume the same story in The Hour of the Gun 1967  the demystifying Doc Frank Perry 1971 with Harris Yulin and Stacy Keach or the more modern Wyatt Earp Lawrence Kasdan 1994 with Kevin Costner and Dennis Quaid and Tombstone Wyatt Earp 's legend 1993 by George P. Cosmatos 1993 with Kurt Russell  Bill Paxton  Thomas Haden Church  Stephen Lang  Dana Denaley  Robert Burke and Val KilmerThis is a story enormous in scope unusual in concept with a mileaminute action on a climatic and thrillaminute gunfight. Packs a magnificent and marvelous cinematography in Black and White with a nice sense of period  and in overblown and amazing deep by Joe MacDonald . As well as adequate costuming and lavish production design . This thrilling film contains a spectacular and lyric musical score by Cyril Mockridge who composes a rousing soundtrack . The motion picture was compellingly directed by John Ford . This Ford's film  studded with stunning individual scenes turns out to be the definitive rendition of this great story . As Ford said I knew Earp and he told me about the fight at the OK Corral  so we did it exactly the way it had been.".

There are several inaccuracies eg the fate of Doc Holliday Wyatt Earp's brothers aren't in the right order the fate of James Earpp Old Man Clanton was dead before the gunfight....the list goes on. As a slice of history I find it disrespectful to those involved and to the audience watching. So this film is to be watched as a piece of fiction.As a piece of fiction it's a good story and it's acted by a good cast although the film does drag in the middle section. Henry Fonda and Walter Brennan steal the acting honours. Fonda plays the part with a few comedic moments that work and serve to increase your liking of the main character eg the scene where he rides into town and wants a shave. Cathy Downs is a bit of a drip  I have no idea why the film is called what it is other than to get the song in. The music is good during the film but a main criticism will have to be the actual gunfight. There is a bit of tension built up before the gunfight but as for the event  blink and you'll miss it! It's an OK film and I'll be keeping onto it to watch again but I would have preferred to have seen an accurate account.".

Putting aside the events connected to Wyatt Earp there is nothing to indicate that Tombstone is a boomtown based on mining except for one tiny reference to prospecting.  If we are going to have a shootout at the OK corral where are the McLaury brothers 2 of the 3 people killed at the shootout?  The shootout itself bears virtually no resemblance to the actual event and the killing and wounding of the Earp brothers Doc Holliday and their adversaries as depicted in the film are totally at odds with reality with the exception of Billy Clanton killed and Wyatt Earp uninjured.  I have to wonder if John Ford really believed he was being accurate since the history of the event was not widely known at the time of the film. Both female leads are pretty bad both as characters as well as how they are acted.  I liked Victor Mature as Holliday but he seemed out of his element I think being best suited to film noirs.  He is too selfinvolved to develop any real bond with Wyatt which is a detriment in this film.  Doc Holliday has been played by a wide range of actors from Mature to Kirk Douglas to Jason Robards Jr. to the more modern portrayals of Val Kilmer and Dennis Quaid.  They were all  interesting and very different from each other.  I guess Doc is just a great character. Tombstone and Wyatt Earp are the only two films that attempted to get the Tombstone story right.  All the other Earp movies just played with various elements of the true story.  My Darling Clementine makes a good Fonda double feature with the Ox Bow Incident.  7 of 10 stars.".

Upon first glance it might seem like the story has been rehashed from the plotlines of several other Indian films. But the presentation blew me away! Yes I agree that Dil Chahta Hai has been heavily influenced by the Hollywood style of filmmaking. But it still retains the same passion and romanticism that has become a Bollywood staple ever since the beginning thus making DCH a thousand times better than other Hollywoodwannabees.Another thing that you might notice while watching the film is that there is not much of a plot. It just... floats along. But that's what makes it great you never know where the next scene might lead you. What ties the story together is the bond of friendship shared by the three main leads. All the performances were terrific especially Aamir Khan who is probably the most respected actor of his generation.Ultimately what's great about the film is that it connects to the youth. The depiction of youth is so deadon and realistic that you would be disgusted at the way youth is treated in other Bollywood films where every college student aside from the heroheroine are partygoing idiots or jittery nerds! In DCH however the people talk like how they're supposed to talk and nothing seems unrealistic about their personality. While watching the film it becomes quite evident that Farhan Akhtar belongs to a breed of young talented directors. What they lack in experience they make up with an ambitious vision and raw talent.If you haven't seen the film yet go watch it. You'll be surprised at how much hope is still left in Bollywood.".

For me he did a great job by experimenting with a novel idea moving away from the well established norms of the bollywood industry and not presenting yet again melodramatic bollywood plot.The story revolves around three friends supposedy born to very rich parents  their relationship and their personal lifes  the guys with totally different natures and with their different meaning of life. However the only thing that keeps them ever together is their never ending friendship.The story is not so great doesn't convey any specific message but it keeps you glued and is refreshing as many times you watch it. In fact many of the college going Indian youth and even from other countries would be able to relate themselves with the three main movie protagonists.All the actors have given very good performance. Aamir Khan simply reaffirmed his talent. He plays a prankster who has knack of turning every thing into funny and the one who doesn't believe in the institution of love but ultimately falls for it. For Saif Ali Khan this movie may even be called his rebirth. He plays a character who falls for every other girl but is unable to express it when he really starts loving the one. Akhshay Khanna playing a bit mature and serious character may have seemed slightly weaker than the other two but he played his character very well. This guy has a very different meaning for love and falls for an older woman. Preity Zinta looks amazing as always with an all different hair style. Sonali Kulkarni didn't seem so much at ease with the commercial cinema but then too gave pretty good performance.Music by ShankarEshaanLoy combination was also refreshing and different from all that mushy mushy Hindi film music. The great thing about songs that they didn't break the movie rhythm and seemed more to be part of the movie's story.In all a must watch movie.".

Like falling in love. Cracking on your friend who seems to fall for every girl he sees. Or your sensitive friend Sid who is in love with a much older woman  is he crazy? Wince as two of your best friends get into a very heated argument which splits them up and wonder what you will do now that you're caught in the middle. Hope for love and friendship to find a way through to reconciliation.Make a smart movie without elaborate dance pieces set to a sweet soundtrack that remains in the top 10 a year after the film's release. In fact have a song that parodies the 'running around trees' segment that every other Hindi film since the 1950s has had and that the guys at school used to kid about. I mean guys don't express their love for girls that way! Keep out guns drugs politics strife and family melodrama. Lace up your script with generous doses of humor which brings to light the hereunto underused Saif Ali Khan. Finally make sure the 'heroes' have shown some growth at the end of it. Of course it's been done to death in LA. That it could have been done so well in Mumbai is the astonishing thing.Finally make reality cool again. Whatever your heroes wear however they cut their hair right down to the way they interact has to be believable. Make short hair and a goatee beard the national craze amongst guys. Put some real thought into color coding and matching outfits and give a laidback style to the proceedings.Welcome Dil Chahta Hai. The film that has had the largest influence of the look and hopefully the story of the biggest Bollywood films to follow it. A film that many people have been able to relate to.

High marks for this film since it beat the Bollywood standard of being completely incoherent and inane although still sticking to the three plus hours.Can what the Heart Want be controlled?

	schema:reviewBody "Indian movies tend to have a reputation for a being musicals and b having overmodulated distorted sound tracks as if everyone was singing and playing through a guitar fuzzbox. Fuzz is fine in its place heavy metal rock music for example but a surfeit of it can readily wear down the listener.Dil Chahta Hai is a welcome breath of fresh air in the genre. It does have musical numbers but they're very pleasant on the ear as is the sound track in general  modern musical styles in some cases mixed with more traditional musical instruments even a didgeridoo the presence of which is explained below.I have an absolute hatred of musicals so for me to find this movie likable it really has to be something special. The awards it has already won demonstrate that it IS something special.The storyline is a little convoluted which may explain why it takes 3 hours to run its course  around twice as long as its western counterparts although Indian audiences may prefer the much longer format but the acting is excellent throughout and the viewer is kept interested as the multiple interwoven plots twist and turn.This movie demands concentration though to get the whole picture. There is a good deal of spoken English mixed with Hindi so the subtitles are a must for those who don't understand Hindi but the English speech is not often mirrored in the subtitles so one must both listen carefully and watch carefully in order not to miss a beat.The subtitles themselves are not perfect using unusual punctuation at times to emphasize a point a word bracketed by a plus or minus symbol on one side and a two thirds fraction on the other takes a little time to absorb for example.But these are only minor niggles. This movie is richly textured and provides a visual a feast throughout especially if like me you are not familiar with the sights and sounds of places like Bombay and Goa. A good part of the movie is also set in Sydney Australia providing plenty of material to keep the interest going and hence the presence of the aboriginal instrument noted earlier.This is very much a westernised production with characters and behaviours that are possibly harder for traditional Indian audiences to identify with I had no difficulty though with identifying with the three main male characters  three guys who are firm friends and have been for some years and who may separate but somehow always manage to come back together when circumstances demand it. This kind of theme is pretty universal  the British TV series Last of the Summer Wine operates along pretty much the same lines albeit fifty years on.One of the themes is the conflict between traditionalist parents and modernist offspring in particular the arranged marriage and the author leaves the audience to make up their own mind about which is right but maybe with a slight nudge in the direction of the traditionalists.The only gripe I have is with the choice of the anglicised title Do Your Thing for the US market. I think that totally misses the point of the movie. From the subtitles Dil Chahta Hai translates as The heart wants... which would be more accurately and pertinently translated as What The Heart Wants....In other words the storyline is more about following your heart in love than it is about leading a selfindulgent life which obviously these characters do most of the time  courtesy of being very well off and generally able to please themselves what they do not quite the little rich kids but verging on it.This movie is that rare beast a guy flick that is also a chick flick. Guys will enjoy watching it for the macho moments girls will enjoy it for the soulful scenes and the fact that the women generally behave with more maturity than the guys and the weepy bits.All in all a very enjoyable watchable movie. If this is a new direction for the socalled Bollywood cinema then it is very welcome and I would like to see more of the same.As a professional writer I'd even be interested in contributing to that new direction...".

Debutant director Farhan Akhtar's son of Javed Akhtar and Honey Irani Dil Chahta Hai is the story of three friends and their respective thinking of love. It has a new trendy and youthful look completely different from the standards norms of the Bollywood film.Akash Aamir Khan Sameer Saif Ali Khan and Siddharth aka Sid Akshaye Khanna three close friends have completed their education and are on the threshold of life. Akash does not believe in love. He is a flirt and his love affairs do not last for more than a month. Sameer believes in love. He is always carrying his heart on his palm and falling in love every time. But he still has not found that special girl. Sid a painter is the most sensitive and mature among the three. He knows the true meaning of love. He finds love in everything everywhere and everytime.All three are enjoying life. Then comes the twist when Sid falls in love with older woman Tara Jaiswal Dimple Kapadia an interior designer who is a divorcee. Akash is not able to understand the depth of Sid's love and hurts his sentiments for which Sid slaps Akash thus creating a rfit between the two friends. Sameer tries to bridge the gap but is unsuccessful.Sid leaves for a painting workshop at Kaushali. Akash leaves for Australia for his dad's business. On the flight he meets Shalini Preity Zinta who he had briefly known earlier. Their friendship slowly blossoms into love. Meanwhile Sameer also finds his special girl in Pooja Sonali Kulkarni whom he wants to marry. Time has passed. All three friends are again in the same town  but things are different for them now.Full marks to director Farhan Akhtar for giving a completely new and fresh look to the film in his debut film. The storyline is different from the runofthemill fares which we are used to seeing for such a long time. Farhan is a welcomed entry in the list of talented and young directors. He has also dared to be different. He has taken care of the minutest details in the film. Technically the film is no way behind some of the best Hollywood movies.Now the performances  all the three leads are fabulous. They all fit their roles to a T. Aamir Khan as expected is the best. He is too good in the comic scenes and is excellent in the emotional scenes also  especially in the scene when he breaks down on the phone while talking to his father. He definitely is the best among the current lot who does his work with precision and utmost dedication. Saif Ali Khan is a wonderful surprise in this film. This is his careerbest role and one cannot imagine anyone else playing Sameer's role. His sense of timing and facial expressions are very natural and makes Sameer a very adorable character in the film.The least significant role was of Sameer but Saif made it very important. Now comes the final winner  Akshaye Khanna. An actorpar excellence and very natural in front of the camera Akshaye has played the role of Sid to perfection. His emotions and expressive face say a lot. He has given a spellbinding performance. Preity looks great in her new look and has acted well. Sonali Kulkarni is wasted and Dimple Kapadia still looks gorgeous and plays her role well.Music and the picturisation of the songs flow with the mood of the film. The locales of Sydney and Goa have been brilliantly shot. The first half of the film has some of the light good moments. The second half is filled with emotion though the AamirPreity affair has been stretched a lot thus making the film a bit lengthy. But one thing is sure  Bollywood has got one more talented director in Farhan Akhtar.".

	schema:headline " Beginning of a new generation of Bollywood films";
	schema:reviewBody "Before getting into the details I must admit that this is certainly one of the best and most entertaining films I have ever seen!RATING 12 out of Plot  The story is about three very good friends and their relationships with each other. Aamir Khan plays a sociable and mischievous Akash Saif Ali Khan plays a confused often 'lovestruck' Sameer and Akshaye Khanna plays a mature confident Siddharth or Sid. Preity Zinta plays Shalini  Akash's love interest though throughout the film Akash claims that he does not believe in love. Sonali Kulkarni plays Pooja with whom Sameer finally really falls in love and Dimple Kapadia is Tara Jaiswal a divorced middleaged alcholic. Thats all one needs to know about the film because right from the first reel the viewer is absorbed into the story and learns about each character.Review  Full credit must go to the director Farhan Akhtar who has broken many of the Bollywood production norms in order to make a technically perfect and enjoyable film. It would be unfair to call Aamir Khan the life of the DCH though his popularity in India and abroad would have drawn a substantial part of the film's audience. He gives a brilliant performance as usual as Akash. His scenes with Akshaye Khanna and some scenes shot in Australia Opera phone call to Sid etc are mindblowing! SAif Ali Khan is the surprise packet of Dil Chahta Hai and there is a lot of untapped talent in him especially where comedy roles are concerned. But I felt that the best performance came from Akshaye Khanna who plays the character of Sid to perfection. His mannerisms thinking behaviour is very authentic and makes us all identify with his character closely. Preity Zinta looks gorgeous and is her usual chirpy self. Sonali Kulkarni could have certainly looked better without all that makeup. Dimple Kapadia shows how a good role can bring out an elegant performance from a seasoned actress.The best aspect of Dil Chahta Hai other than the actors' performances was the music. This is hopefully the start of more nonrun of the mill compositions in Bollywood. Ofcourse I hope for a lot more compositions like these from the music directors ShankarEshaanLoy. The title song was the best and gels really well with this trndy film. Other good songs are 'Jaane Kyon' 'Kaise HAi yeh Rut' and 'Tanhayee'. 'Woh ladki hai  kahan'  a parody of old Hindi songs is simply hillarious. The lyrics provided by the director's father veteran Javed Akhtar are simply amazing and complement the story of the film to perfection!Overall a very entertaining feature and I hope to see more films like these in the near future. Three cheers to Farhan Akhtar and his team!!!".

	onyx:emotionText "Before getting into the details I must admit that this is certainly one of the best and most entertaining films I have ever seen!RATING 12 out of Plot  The story is about three very good friends and their relationships with each other. Aamir Khan plays a sociable and mischievous Akash Saif Ali Khan plays a confused often 'lovestruck' Sameer and Akshaye Khanna plays a mature confident Siddharth or Sid. Preity Zinta plays Shalini  Akash's love interest though throughout the film Akash claims that he does not believe in love. Sonali Kulkarni plays Pooja with whom Sameer finally really falls in love and Dimple Kapadia is Tara Jaiswal a divorced middleaged alcholic. Thats all one needs to know about the film because right from the first reel the viewer is absorbed into the story and learns about each character.Review  Full credit must go to the director Farhan Akhtar who has broken many of the Bollywood production norms in order to make a technically perfect and enjoyable film. It would be unfair to call Aamir Khan the life of the DCH though his popularity in India and abroad would have drawn a substantial part of the film's audience. He gives a brilliant performance as usual as Akash. His scenes with Akshaye Khanna and some scenes shot in Australia Opera phone call to Sid etc are mindblowing! SAif Ali Khan is the surprise packet of Dil Chahta Hai and there is a lot of untapped talent in him especially where comedy roles are concerned. But I felt that the best performance came from Akshaye Khanna who plays the character of Sid to perfection. His mannerisms thinking behaviour is very authentic and makes us all identify with his character closely. Preity Zinta looks gorgeous and is her usual chirpy self. Sonali Kulkarni could have certainly looked better without all that makeup. Dimple Kapadia shows how a good role can bring out an elegant performance from a seasoned actress.The best aspect of Dil Chahta Hai other than the actors' performances was the music. This is hopefully the start of more nonrun of the mill compositions in Bollywood. Ofcourse I hope for a lot more compositions like these from the music directors ShankarEshaanLoy. The title song was the best and gels really well with this trndy film. Other good songs are 'Jaane Kyon' 'Kaise HAi yeh Rut' and 'Tanhayee'. 'Woh ladki hai  kahan'  a parody of old Hindi songs is simply hillarious. The lyrics provided by the director's father veteran Javed Akhtar are simply amazing and complement the story of the film to perfection!Overall a very entertaining feature and I hope to see more films like these in the near future.

It is the story of three friends just graduated from college. Akash does not believe in love and seems to facy himself a player. Throughout the film you can almost see through him... he is afraid of being hurt. Sameer wants nothing more than to love and be loved. However he is just as foolish as Akash as he throws himself at all the wrong girls. Siddharth is the shy one who seems to comprehend the complexity of love. When he falls for an older woman he brings a new aspect to the story love is selfless and asks nothing in return. Throughout this movie you see these three stories develop causing the audience to wonder 'What is love?' It has been hailed as a hip movie with modern clothes and hairstyles. While this is true it is also a highly artistic movie that never misses a beat or an opportunity for depth. An actor once said that an actor should be a person who holds a mirror so the audience can see themselves. I hardly think it possible to watch this movie without seeing a little bit of Akash's cynicism Sameer's naivete and Siddharth's willingness to fight for love in ourselves. This is a mustsee not only for Bollywood fans but for hopeless romantics and cynics alike. This one will make you think.".

The characters are real and very easy to relate to the dialogues are simple and genuine the proceedings are dramatic yet realistic and the film is extremely interesting and entertaining. The film is emotional but it never goes overthetop. Farhan Akhtar makes an impressive directorial debut. His excellent direction is aided by extraordinary music brilliant cinematography effective editing fantastic city locations and some very impressive performances by the ensemble cast. The camaraderie between the three friends looks most real and believable. I can't recall any other Indian film I've seen before or after Dil Chahta Hai which portrayed true friendship as well as this one.Aamir Khan though initially seems to be miscast in the role of the completely cynical womaniser Akash demonstrates a very fine versatility in this role and successfully shows the gradual growth in his character with depth and humour. Saif Ali Khan in his best performance up until that point is just brilliant as the insecure and very kindhearted Sameer. He displays confusion and fear with great conviction and a fantastic pinch of comedy. Akshaye Khanna is outstanding in this wonderful dramatic role of a serious and sensitive guy who falls for a woman much ahead of his age. Preity Zinta is marvelous as Shalini and skillfully sensitises her character. She plays the part with grace and restraint and her inner feelings are perfectly understood thanks to her expressive eyes. Dimple Kapadia adds another accomplished performance to her vast repertoire. Sonali Kulkarni's real talent is unfortunately wasted though she does try to do the best of what she is given.Overall Dil Chahta Hai is a remarkable picture about life and it should provide a great deal of quality entertainment to each and every viewer whoever and wherever he is. A great film which is according to me the best Hindi film of 2001.".

This is a story of the labyrinth of their love lives ending with them growing apart in the present day.The characters party. They fall in love. They live modern lives. I don't want to sound ignorant but this is a very Western modern Bollywood movie. I do notice the high IMDb rating but I wonder if this broke some cultural barrier back in India. I don't know anything about that but I'm going to try to review this like any other Western movie.There is some bro acting going on here. I would prefer the opening first act to be only about the three friends by themselves. They need to establish their friendship as the opener. Their chemistry is the most important aspect of the movie. It's more important than the romances. They need to show that they're the drivetotheairport friends and even buryadeadbody friends. They need to open by explaining their friendship. Sometimes movies do this by showing their first meetings. I don't feel that connection has been established.This is a long three hour movie. There is the regular Bollywood songanddance. It's still long even without the songs. I like the guys. They seem like really nice fun guys. The movie kinda works by hanging out with them. It's no masterpiece by any means.".

I don't want to sound ignorant but this is a very Western modern Bollywood movie. I do notice the high IMDb rating but I wonder if this broke some cultural barrier back in India. I don't know anything about that but I'm going to try to review this like any other Western movie.There is some bro acting going on here. I would prefer the opening first act to be only about the three friends by themselves. They need to establish their friendship as the opener. Their chemistry is the most important aspect of the movie. It's more important than the romances. They need to show that they're the drivetotheairport friends and even buryadeadbody friends. They need to open by explaining their friendship. Sometimes movies do this by showing their first meetings. I don't feel that connection has been established.This is a long three hour movie. There is the regular Bollywood songanddance. It's still long even without the songs. I like the guys. They seem like really nice fun guys. The movie kinda works by hanging out with them. It's no masterpiece by any means.";

If you've never seen a Bollywood film before this is the best place you could start.Akash Aamir Siddharth or Sid Akshaye and Sameer Saif are best friends. They are all different Akash is very critical and a prankster he believes that love doesn't last more than a couple of weeks. Sid is the most serious and mature of the three he is a little shy and often disappears in his own world of painting. Sameer is desperately romantic and falls in love a lot. Often this ends in heartbreak...Nevertheless despite their differences the trio have something in common their love for each other. Soon the three find their own lives dragging them forward forced to leave the others behind and they realize the value and seriousness of life. They discover many things along the way like true love and true friendship. When their lives collide again their individual worlds are shaken up once more leaving them with the support they really need each other.Aamir gives a very funfilled suave performance he is comical and the audience will always love him its brilliant. Saif Ali Khan does an awesome job it's comedy but it's a very strong performance too. Akshaye Khanna gets full credit for the best performance in this movie. Not only did he get the best role but he played it to perfection the fight scene with Akash was brilliant. I give him my full applause. The pretty Preity Zinta also gives a noteworthy performance. Her cute smile and charming personality light up the screen and makes the movie refreshing. Sonali Kulkarni gives a gritty performance. She is forgettable but she does play the role well. Dimple Kapadia plays the depressed alcoholic mom easily. Ayub Khan Rajat Kapoor and Suhasini Mulay give small but important roles.The music is amazing. Certainly the best part about the film. Farhan Akhtar has done a fantastic job.I'd say 8 out of 10 stars...WATCH IT!".

A lot of the scenarios shown are relatable and have happened to many people in real life. Everything about this movie is great starting with Farhan Akhtar's direction. He did majority of the writing and screenplay for this movie and he did great. He also directed it very well. What a way to debut as a director. Second the performances. Everyone did great. Saif Ali Khan and Akshaye Khanna did great and fit their roles nicely Saif did great as the helpless flirt and he gave a good natural performance. This performance revived his career. Akshaye Khanna played the quiet Sidd very well he handled emotions well and his performance was also very good. Preity Zinta also impressed. But it was Aamir Khan who stole the show. He portrayed Akash very well to the point where you could not even imagine that it was originally Akshaye Khanna who was supposed to do that role. Aamir became the character himself. He showed everything from perfect comic timing to excellent emotional display. Another thing I really liked was the entire cast's chemistry. It made everything look so real and natural. You really thought that Akash Sameer and Sidd were real friends. The music is also great with classic songs like Jaane Kyon and Who Ladki Hain Kahaan. The story was gripping and nice even with some small clichs. It was also however extremely relatable and enjoyable. Im sure many especially the youth would really love this great new age film.".

Farhan Akhtar is brilliant and this will always be one of his master pieces no matter how many movies he makes in the future. The movie starts with the present with Dimple Kapadia being admitted in the hospital and then a flashback sets in. Farhan Akhtar has created the characters of the three main protagonists with a lot attention to detail and thus has created characters that the youth in India can relate to. The protagonists are not extraordinary heroes nor are they spoilt brats. They are just normal young Indians with new ideas raised in affluent families. They have the right blend of traditions and modernity. The movie consists of a strong plot good characters who are believable and yet interesting. The songs of the movie are excellent too. The picturizations and script is great. Overall a well done movie with good acting from all the main actors  Aamir Khan Saif Ali Khan Akshaye Khanna Preity Zinta Sonali Kulkarni and the ever beautiful Dimple Kapadia.

	schema:headline " Arnold Knew How To Make Entertaining Films";
	schema:reviewBody "A decade ago this Arnold Schwarzenegger action flick was fairly hot stuff but I wonder if it would have the impact today since special effects are so much better and we've seen so many of these type of action stories in the past 10 years.One of Arnold's keys to his successful career in films was simply that his movies were entertaining and that's why people come to the theaters. Highbrow critics often forget that. Eraser is a prime example. Entertainment alone is how this particular movie survives since common logic doesn't exist while violence and profanity are overdone. But despite it's lowbrow tastes and stupidity it's still generally fun to watch if you can put your brain on hold for two hours. It's also fun to hear if you have a nice surround system.This movie has one of the most outrageous action scenes I've ever seen on film even to this day one in which Arnold hangs from the outside of a jet airplane finally lets go freefalls to catch his parachute that had been ripped off and then has to worry about the jet plane which had circled around and was going to smash him!!The audio came into play nicely each time the super rifle that was featured in the movie was shot. Vanessa Williams plays the female lead satisfactorily and James Caan is very effective as the villain. Robert Pastorelli and James Coburn also add to the fun. A few laughs along the way help this nobrainer to become even more entertaining.".

	schema:reviewBody "Eraser is a film typical of its genre. What genre you ask? Why the the terroristsarecomingandit's onemanagainsttheworldsoshootemup blowemup and savethegirlandtheday genre of course. Too complicated for you? Don't worry because the movie isn't. As a matter of fact it's readily accessible to anyone over the age of 7  not that this movie is ageappropriate for everyone over the age of 7 Note This was my favorite movie when I was 10  but rather that the concepts and thus the plot are simple. This isn't a movie you go see if you're seeking a two hour thinking experience.Casting Schwarzenegger for the lead instantly gives the main character John Kruger a personality of his own. Though nothing is ever known of his background even by the end credits that doesn't matter. Dialogue is used mainly for two purposes to explain the unfolding saga of the federal scandal in the movie and for the evercomposed and evercool Schwarzenegger to calm Dr. Lee Cullen Vanessa Williams a key witness in the scandal saga. Instead what drives the movie is the action sequences and Schwarzenegger's resourcefulness in a myriad of combat situations where he always finds himself outmanned outgunned and beaten to the first punch yet always manages to gain the upper hand.Williams does an excellent job and in many ways is forced to be more of an actor per se than Schwarzenegger. She has to display a wide array of emotions from sadness to fear to regret to resolve and even anger while Schwarzenegger is only called on to mainly display the final two. James Caan is legitimately a scumbag in his role as Robert DeGuerin and James Coburn in a smaller role is fatherly to Kruger as Chief Beller. Solid unspectacular performances all around...save that of Caan who borders on something more.The action in this movie is incredible for its time. The rail guns are visually impressive if not scientifically plausible but who cares about that anyway? and Schwarzenegger's combat ingenuity gives flavor and style to the action sequences. Director Russell seems to show a bizarre fixation with bloody puncture wounds objects protruding entirely through the skin throughout but does show some creativity of his own in placing Schwarzenegger in clever combat situations where he can use his mind to outsmart his many moreheavilyarmed enemies. Russell also plays with the moviegoer in several situations making it unclear whether or not Kruger is alive after several close calls. This keeps moviegoers on the edge of their seats for the nonstop thrill ride that rarely pauses to take a breath. From the first scene to the last explosions shooting and violence are the norm and it is not meant to be any other way.".

He gets to erase an important witness Vanessa Williams who knows about her company's illegal activities as it sells guns to foreigners. The film is full of action and mayhem which is great since hardboiled action films are not made too often in Hollywood anymore.There are hardly any stops throughout the movie and the viewer should not be bored at least I wasn't now that I watched the movie for the second time. It looks fantastic in its original widescreen format and this is definitely among Arnold's more noteworthy performances and proves the talent of director Chuck Scorpion King Elm Street 3 Russell. There are many effects that look pretty realistic and the crocodile shoot out is one memorable scene and maybe that is the screenwriters' comment on zoos' that don't feed their animals sufficiently as the crocodiles are VERY hungry and fierce for food! Also there is one over the top airplane scene that really grabs an attention. The actors are great throughout the film and James Caan doesn't make an exception. The finale is perhaps little too familiar and relies on gun fights and explosions but still as a whole I found this film very pleasant experience in its own genre. It is not the greatest action film ever made in Hollywood but it is one of the most interesting US action films of the 90's.710".

I think it ranks right up there with the TERMINATOR movies and TRUE LIES. The plot I think is better in this movie than in most of Schwarzenegger's movies and of course the action does not disappoint.Dr. Lee Cullen Vanessa Williams a dedicated worker for the Cyrez Corporation learns that there is a conspiracy going on within her business. Guns that were supposed to have been being made for the military are finding themselves in the hands of terrorists. Lee does an undercover job for the FBI and barely escapes alive. U.S. Marshal John Kruger Arnold Schwarzenegger of the Witness Protection Program is assigned to protect Lee. Kruger will erase Lee's identity to keep her safe. But when he finds out that his mentor and teacher Robert Deguerin James Caan is also in on the conspiracy both Lee and Kruger are in danger.Much credit goes out to the main actors of this movie. Arnold Schwarzeneger does a fine job although this character is the same type of character her normally plays. James Kaan is excellent in this film as is the beautiful Vanessa Williams did an excellent job. Robert Pastorelli also does a great job playing the comic relief of this movie.The plot is very good and it usually keeps the views interested and on the edge of his seat. There are also some great special effects that are used for the weapons in this movie. It's another great case of Arnold kicking some enemy  and saving the day as well as the girl. Check it out!".

	schema:reviewBody "After Arnold Schwarzenegger's 1997 heart surgery his box office popularity faded. 1996's Kindergarten Cop is a comedy and he did not play the lead role in Batman and Robin even though his name grabbed him top billing. That makes Eraser his last great action film until Terminator 3 became his last hurrah for now anyway. Schwarzenegger plays John Kruger The Eraser. He puts the protection in the Witness Protection Program.I cannot imagine a better beginning. Two thugs have invaded the home of a Federal witness Robert Pastorelli. His wife writhes on the floor as the duo prepare to burn the house. Hearing gagged screams of a visibly bound woman having gasoline poured on her is not a pleasant experience for most people nor is the sight of an innocent man about to have his tongue removed. The sounds and images ramp up audience hate towards the two then greatly increases the euphoria when Kruger comes in and kills them in a most unpleasant fashion. His timely rough justice spurs us to root even for him even harder later on even if the effect is on a subconscious level.His next assignment is Lee Cullen Vanessa Williams who works Cyrez a weapons manufacturer. Company President William Donahue the always dependable James Cromwell is selling high tech weapons on the open market weapons that are supposed to be for the United States only. As Kruger points out the men who recruit Cullen fail to inform her that she will need to be placed under Witness Protection. She refuses the program and returns home. An encounter with hitech hit men forces her to reconsider and Kruger places her in a secret location and gives her a new identity.The new weapon is the rail gun. It uses magnetic fields to propel aluminum rounds close to the speed of light. Of course that means it can shoot through walls and its scope can see through them though not in great detail. There is a side shot of one being fired later and the rounds are obviously not moving as quickly as advertised. They leave a visible trail but it takes two of three frames for them to move the length of the shot when it should be all the way through in one but I don't care. The graphic looks cool and such a small detail is hardly a deal breaker.Any list of the positives must start with Vanessa Williams. Cullen is hardly a part with Oscar caliber demands but Williams plays her about as perfectly as possible. She is firm and disdainful when speaking to Donahue then firm and surprised during her later meeting with FBI agents. She is often required to act fearfully and in a state of controlled panic. Selling those emotions is not easy. I have acting experience I should know. The former Miss America is more known as a singer than an actress but her performance here illustrates why she received a musical theater scholarship to Syracuse. The aftermath of the first attack on her provides her best moment.Similar praise goes to James Caan playing Kruger's mentor. Caan is also a talented actor. The same can also be said of James Coburn as the Witness Protection agency's highest officer. Both had spent over thirty years in movie acting by 1996 and there abilities are evident in how well they convey their authority. There are too many action films with weak acting but people like Williams Caan Coburn and Pastorelli ensure that Eraser is the opposite. Melora Walters provides arguably the best acting in her small but animated part as the Pastorelli character's wife.The action of course must be well done and for the most part it lives up to the Schwarzenegger standards. The opening scene is set up so well it does not have to be good but it is and the precedent is set. The action is not Arnold's best but still more than adequate. I was disappointed at how little the rail gun is used and I probably would have voted an eight if it made more appearances. When it does come the action is not disappointing. Watching Arnold wield them brought a big smile to my face. Their lack of screen time a detriment but with good acting and clever plot there are still more than enough qualities to earn a full recommendation for yet another good effort from Mr. Schwarzenegger.".

Fortunately it turned out to be a great movie in the end. The only nitpick would be those obviously fake CGI crocodiles used in one scene but otherwise the movie has consistency in quality. This movie also introduced the famous rail gun which became an instant hit when videogames copied it. The rail gun in the movie itself is more like a super fast rocket launcher than a sniping weapon. The story itself surrounds the marketing of that weapon. The acting is very good as is the screenplay and cinematography. This film isn't anything new isn't a groundbreaker in any way but is still highly enjoyable.".

	schema:reviewBody "The flick tells us about something that can be as scary than any large nuclear weaponthe electromagnetic assault gun. Specifically it is the EM1 rail gun.Vanessa Williams points out that this gun fires metal bullets by way of electromagnetic pulse at a rate of about 186000 mphabout light speed.Film cameras also find another use of this gun....it uses heatseeking technology that finds any human flesh. Once the technology finds the human flesh the gun locks on to its target making it easy to fire.Besides the fear created by the EM1 gun there were several other parts that I liked about the film. Thislike other action filmsare not complete without exciting stunts. The airplane scene is popular when Arnold gets off a flying plane and catches the plane's emergency parachute while in the air gets that parachute on and finally pulls the rip cord to activate the main parachute.But you think it is over? There were more stunts I like when the plane makes a very big bank around...and heads straight towards him! Arnold knows that and he pulls out his 9milimeter Beretta to fire several shots at the plane nevertheless the plane still rams right into him with the parachute ripping off the main parachute.Going down to imminent death at a speed of 120 mph he also knows that the parachute apparatus has a backup parachute to replace the one that was ripped off by the plane. He releases that chute at about 80 feet above ground just before he hits his body very hard on a junkyard car at about 4050 mph. The junkyard car's roof is crushed and its windows are broken from the impact therefore the car absorbed some of the impact of him hitting the ground saving the protagonist from what would have been death...and he lives another day.This definitely speaks of all of those James Bond movies.Or the zoo scene which was slightly better when all of those alligators first take out the enemy shooters who were after Vanessa and then when Arnold comes in he faces off with one of the alligators that was about to bite his head off but somehow Arnold fires one 9millimeter round to kill one of those voracious reptiles cold as the alligator opened its mouth wide. With that this reminds me of all of the Jaws movies.".

The premise is wonderful but the product could have been better. The director cast and production crew should have been slightly more ambitious with this film's mold...That having been said ERASER is a fine treat for male audiences. There's plenty of action energy and blood with a fair amount of thrills. Interesting adventure sequences include Arnold parachuting from a burning passenger jet and Arnold again attempting to fight against a myriad of maneating crocodiles barefisted. Though instead he had to resort to conventional firearms as weapons. By the end when the battle is every man for himself Arnold's methods of nailing and eliminating the enemy with their own medicine is pure poetic justice!Some outrageous stunts and special effects plus the presence of Herculean Arnold Schwarzenegger boost ERASER above complete imbecility. Still the failure to convey any character depth or meaning into a simplistic plot may classify ERASER as an escapist film but also a mindless action film as well. Never once do the characters convince the audience the gravity of the situation. The performers never persuade the audience to think about the consequences of their actions. Is ERASER a thoughtprovoking film? Yeah right!  ERASER is a standard kill or be killed thriller nothing more.Considering Arnold's earlier blockbuster achievements which actually included three dimensional characters such as TOTAL RECALL 1990 TERMINATOR 2 JUDGMENT DAY 1991 and TRUE LIES 1994 this film is somewhat rudimentary in characterization. For many people though this quality may not exactly be a setback.ERASER is a film that is always fun to sit back watch and enjoy the action! If you expect anything profound from this movie...try again. ERASER is a cool better than expected action film with great special effects two appealing leads and a package full of car explosions and other assortments of surprises and tricks. Sure ERASER may not be a classic action film but entertaining it definitely is. A better plot though can prove to be very conducive for a film of this caliber...RATING 12 out of .".

	schema:headline " One of Arnie's classic nobrainer shoot'emups.";
	schema:reviewBody "Eraser starts as weapons manufacturer Cyrez executive Lee Cullen Vanessa Williams steals some important data for the FBI to help prove that hitech weaponry developed for the US military is being sold to foreign terrorists. Cullen is caught on CCTV cameras stealing the information  the people behind the plan want her dead in steps witness protection agent  US Marshal John Kruger Arnold Schwarzenegger who is a specialist is 'erasing' the lives of the people he is trying to protect  relocate. As the stakes get higher  a lot of very important  dangerous people are implicated by the information Cullen has they have to get at John to reveal where she is but John is the best there is  intends to bring the bad guy's down  save the life of Cullen...Coexecutive produced  directed by Chuck Russell as Charles Russell this was an attempt by Schwarzenegger to get back to his roots after the disaster that is Junior 1994 which he made two years prior while Eraser isn't up to the standard of say a Total Recall 1990 or a Terminator 2 Judgemnt Day 1991 in my opinion it's a damned sight better than either a Kindergarten Cop 1990 or a True Lies 1994. Anyway the script by Tony Puryear  Walon Green apparently went through lots of rewrites from many different writers  so the final shooting script was referred to it 'looking like a rainbow'  also according to the IMDb Terminator 2 Judgment Day cowriter William Wisher Jr. did multiple rewrites during production as well so it's maybe somewhat of a surprise that Eraser is as good as it is. There's nothing deep or meaningful here in Eraser it is what it is an unashamedly violent big budget action flick. The character's are decent but I didn't like the idea of Schwarzenegger killing so many FBI agents who were just following orders OK they were orders from corrupt officials but they were only doing their job  it just didn't sit well with me that Schwarzenegger was killing everyone in sight regardless of overriding factors. I mean he was supposed to be the all American hero of the piece wasn't he? Away from the moralistic side of things Eraser has plenty to enjoy if your an action junkie there's explosions gun fights huge cool looking hitech futuristic weaponry fights  some good setpieces including one taken straight from the James Bond film Moonraker 1981 where Schwarzenegger gets thrown out of a plane without a parachute  he has to skydive after one to a great sequence in a New York zoo involving several Crocodiles.Director Russell does a good job  he directs with pace  a fair amount of energy. The action scenes are suitably big budget  suitably over the top although as usual for this type of film there are scenes which really push the boundaries of plausibility with Schwarzenegger falling out of a plane without a parachute  surviving by landing on a car sustaining injuries yet seemingly getting over them very quickly  a scene which shows him hanging onto the side of a flying plane using just his fingertips. I thought the story revolving around the weapons could have been better  doesn't have much of an impact for instance it's never revealed who exactly is buying them or for what purpose  surely one gun is pretty much like any other? I don't really see why having a technologically more advanced gun is going to make a huge difference as I said surely a gun is just a gun? There is plenty of violence here  a body count to almost rival World War II those who don't like strong graphic violence should give Eraser a miss.With a supposed budget of about 100000000 this had a lot of money spent on it I don't think it was a huge boxoffice success  while it definitely didn't flop it was probably a disappointment for Warner Bros. According to the IMDb lots of scenes were written lit  prepared to be filmed but never were  that drove the budget up. If that is true I cannot for the life of me figure out why they weren't shot there's just no reason for it.

	onyx:emotionText "Eraser starts as weapons manufacturer Cyrez executive Lee Cullen Vanessa Williams steals some important data for the FBI to help prove that hitech weaponry developed for the US military is being sold to foreign terrorists. Cullen is caught on CCTV cameras stealing the information  the people behind the plan want her dead in steps witness protection agent  US Marshal John Kruger Arnold Schwarzenegger who is a specialist is 'erasing' the lives of the people he is trying to protect  relocate. As the stakes get higher  a lot of very important  dangerous people are implicated by the information Cullen has they have to get at John to reveal where she is but John is the best there is  intends to bring the bad guy's down  save the life of Cullen...Coexecutive produced  directed by Chuck Russell as Charles Russell this was an attempt by Schwarzenegger to get back to his roots after the disaster that is Junior 1994 which he made two years prior while Eraser isn't up to the standard of say a Total Recall 1990 or a Terminator 2 Judgemnt Day 1991 in my opinion it's a damned sight better than either a Kindergarten Cop 1990 or a True Lies 1994. Anyway the script by Tony Puryear  Walon Green apparently went through lots of rewrites from many different writers  so the final shooting script was referred to it 'looking like a rainbow'  also according to the IMDb Terminator 2 Judgment Day cowriter William Wisher Jr. did multiple rewrites during production as well so it's maybe somewhat of a surprise that Eraser is as good as it is. There's nothing deep or meaningful here in Eraser it is what it is an unashamedly violent big budget action flick. The character's are decent but I didn't like the idea of Schwarzenegger killing so many FBI agents who were just following orders OK they were orders from corrupt officials but they were only doing their job  it just didn't sit well with me that Schwarzenegger was killing everyone in sight regardless of overriding factors. I mean he was supposed to be the all American hero of the piece wasn't he? Away from the moralistic side of things Eraser has plenty to enjoy if your an action junkie there's explosions gun fights huge cool looking hitech futuristic weaponry fights  some good setpieces including one taken straight from the James Bond film Moonraker 1981 where Schwarzenegger gets thrown out of a plane without a parachute  he has to skydive after one to a great sequence in a New York zoo involving several Crocodiles.Director Russell does a good job  he directs with pace  a fair amount of energy. The action scenes are suitably big budget  suitably over the top although as usual for this type of film there are scenes which really push the boundaries of plausibility with Schwarzenegger falling out of a plane without a parachute  surviving by landing on a car sustaining injuries yet seemingly getting over them very quickly  a scene which shows him hanging onto the side of a flying plane using just his fingertips. I thought the story revolving around the weapons could have been better  doesn't have much of an impact for instance it's never revealed who exactly is buying them or for what purpose  surely one gun is pretty much like any other? I don't really see why having a technologically more advanced gun is going to make a huge difference as I said surely a gun is just a gun? There is plenty of violence here  a body count to almost rival World War II those who don't like strong graphic violence should give Eraser a miss.With a supposed budget of about 100000000 this had a lot of money spent on it I don't think it was a huge boxoffice success  while it definitely didn't flop it was probably a disappointment for Warner Bros. According to the IMDb lots of scenes were written lit  prepared to be filmed but never were  that drove the budget up. If that is true I cannot for the life of me figure out why they weren't shot there's just no reason for it. The acting is alright Scharzenegger is his usual self while James Cann makes for a good villain  it's nice to see James Coburn in there as well.Eraser is is a great big budget action film the sort that Schwarzenegger could make in his sleep I personally really liked it despite a slightly weak story  think it's one of Arnie's action packed best.";

There's a clinical detachment to this film mainly due to the 'seen it all before' feel as nothing really proves memorable or fresh.However there are lots of reasons to watch. Arnie may look a little old these days but he's still as tough as ever even more so than before as he has his hands and legs impaled by flying shrapnel great scenes and rips them out. Lots of baddies are killed and shot by Schwarzenegger and it's great to see him return to a solid action role after the rather nauseating comedies like JUNIOR and JINGLE ALL THE WAY. Vanessa Williams is the female lead and remains competent but being female she isn't really given much to do. James Caan enjoys himself in an overthetop role as a sneering villain much like Michael Caine in ON DEADLY GROUND. He makes a good adversary.The special effects are all outstanding in this film the super guns being most memorable as they leave plasma rings in the air after a bullet an effect used more extensively in THE MATRIX. There are also a number of outrageous stunts and action sequences set pieces including Arnie jumping out of a plane to get his parachute and a fight in a zoo where crocodiles eat a number of bad guys in a hilarious moment just a shame about the extremely dodgy nature of the CGI effects. The BBFC outrageously cut close to four minutes of the violence on this film's UK release and it's definitely worth tracking down the uncut version. The violence in this is pleasingly hardhitting and old school as Schwarzenegger doesn't shy away from taking out the bad guys  and some good guys too if need be.".

	schema:reviewBody "U.S. Marshal John Kruger Arnie who is credited simply as Eraser in the end credits is...an eraser a man who works for WITSEC or Witness Security erasing the identities of people in the Witness Relocation Program so baddies won't find them and kill them. No one is better than Kruger at what he does but he faces his toughest challenge yet when he's assigned to protect Lee Cullen Williams a woman on the run. After working with the FBI on a sting operation involving illegal gunrunning  especially as it relates to a hightech new EMP gun  now all sorts of bad guys are after her from corrupt U.S. bureaucrats to the Russian Mafia. Not to be confused with Roma Maffia who's in the movie. Kruger's rival is his former compatriot DeGuerin Caan who is a formidable nemesis but Kruger's got plenty of tricks up his sleeve besides erasing people as we'll clearly see. Will DeGuerin and the other baddies get ERASED...permanently? Eraser is probably one of the last best Arnold movies. It's a fitting way to unofficially wrap up the Golden Age of his career of the 80's and 90's because the movie is pure Hollywood ridiculous action in true Schwarzenegger style. It truly is an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie a genre unto itself if that makes any sense. You pretty much have to love it. It's nice to see a younger thinner more agile Arnie along with his unmistakable voice. Of course he gets many classic oneliners to cap off many sequences. The fact that Kruger is supposed to be a U.S. Marshal but becomes an unkillable superhero who for all intents and purposes can fly and survive grievous injuries with ease is an oversight of the best kind something the audience has to go with and couldn't do without unless they wanted a much less entertaining movie.The whole thing is very 90's with classic computers including the verynew Internet and some nowvintage cell phones. The technology even helps Kruger with his job stating on the screen Prepare to Erase. But whether tiny budget or huge budget action movies of the day had one thing in common people after the disc in this case what appears to be some more hot technology Minidisc. Someone always wants that darn disc. But you KNOW the action isn't taking place in the present time because James Caan smokes indoors in government buildings. That's the ultimate nono. Only a true bad guy would do that.Besides Caan we also have Vanessa Williams who confronts James Cromwell stating to him that at the Cyrez Corporation treason is part of the corporate strategy!  which sounds like a perfect ad tagline for them. Williams has had a long and storied career but is only really relevant to fans of this site as costar of Under the Gun 1988 with Sam Jones. So between this and that her action pedigree is surprising and pretty respectable. While we often joke about the star singing the end credits song like we've done for Jerry Trimble etc. in this case Williams actually does because this is a Hollywood production after all and they can get highcaliber talent. There is another rockin' tune that plays after the movie which we suspect is Trevor Rabin's Caught a Train but we're not sure. As far as the soundtrack itself there are those wailin' guitar squeals heard often which we liked because we thought it was a throwback to the 80's.Watch out for a cameo from SvenOle Thorsen towards the end of the movie uncredited as a Russian thug. Evidently he and Arnie are buddies. Arnie should have advised him against being in Fatal Combat 1997. Another familiar face for us who turned up briefly was Patrick Kilpatrick which helped to seal Eraser's connection to other action movies of the day. We also liked seeing James Coburn if it was a pretty small role but in a movie filled with actors with distinctive voices i.e. Arnold and Caan he stood out. Pastorelli added energy as Arnold's sidekick and full marks go to one Andy Romano who played Undersecretary of Defense Daniel Harper. Romano is one of those character actors that has been in tons of stuff but gets little acclaim or recognition. We try to celebrate these people especially when they shine and here he certainly does as one of DeGuerin's partners in crime.If what we've read is true Eraser was a troubled production with many problems along the road to completion. It's one of those situations where there are many writers and people have to be brought in to do tons of rewrites. Maybe it's because some Law  Order people started the script or heavyweights like Frank Darabont and even John Milius came in to polish things up but from a viewer's perspective you really can't tell. Nor should you. The whole thing is improbable enough  any behind the scenes flaws are papered over invisibly to us. Eraser is classic bigbudget Arnie Action All the Way  call us oldfashioned but we really enjoyed it.".

Boasting some awesome action sequences including a great final showdown on NYC docks with a whole arsenal of rail guns Eraser really is a nonstop action bonanza....with a story. The technical aspects of Eraser are quite impressive too with the movie being nominated for an Oscar in Sound Effects Editing. The visuals are extremely stimulating making sure the audience is watching. Alan Silvestri's score is also very impressive...especially when Kruger escapes the airborne 737. I must say that this was the best action flick of 1996.

This marked the only 1st unit directing credit for veteran stuntman and stunt coordinator Terry Leonard who's worked on films ranging from McLintock! to The Green Hornet. You know it's comfortably familiar stuff when even if you're watching it for the first time you can easily predict upcoming lines of dialogue. The on location shooting is a bonus as is the excellent music by the underrated Aussie composer Brian May. The action is first rate and keeps us happily watching for the duration. And just to show us how sadistic the baddies are the most memorable scene has them mutilating Keiths' hand with a power drill and threatening his young associate with similar treatment. That makes it all the more glorious when Dryer and associates with the assistance of the Mossad launch the climactic attack on the stronghold where Keith is being kept. It's guaranteed to get you cheering and pumping your fist right up to the final frame. Seven out of 10.".

I'll go German. They were extremely evil too especially in their intro were they completely demolish a dinner table by machine gun and I almost forgot a diplomatic family. Dyer's Sgt. character likes to do things his way but Paul Winfield's American ambassador does things by the book. They clash in the most clichd manner but this won't stop Dyer. He wants payback. And boy does he get it. So what we get is explosions galore you know suicidal bombing slowmotion car chases that end in explosions and then the chaotic ambush filled with explosions  gunfire at the bad guy's hideout. Throw in robotic bad guys  the German pair takes the cake cringeworthy torture stilted dialogues macho posturing marine instincts flag waving dummy stunt work and a stunning Joanna Pacula as an internationalist photographer. The material is quite onesided in its viewpoint but because of this it manages to strike some unintentional laughs in its leave no one behind mindset. Brian May contributes to the funky score.

	schema:reviewBody "When Col. Halloran Keith assigns Gunnery Sgt. Burns Dryer and his young Marines  including Ramirez Gian and Ruggieri Mitchell  to the turbulent middle east country of Jemal despite the willingness of the local military to use their help at first they don't get to do too much. This is thanks to the politically correct outoftouch views of Ambassador Virgil Morgan Winfield who doesn't want to step on any toes. But Morgan and the rest of the Americans get a rude dose of reality in the form of a terrorist named Jihad Tarkington who is orchestrating acts of terror in the region. A photographer Elli Baumann Pacula is documenting his rise to power. When he and his goons kidnap some of Burns' men including Halloran Burns decides to take matters into his own hands and becomes a oneman army bent on revenge! Will he face death dishonor or NEITHER? Find out today! Death Before Dishonor is a classic example of the Reaganera patriotism film. It features good noble Americans doing heroic deeds  and in this era of cynicism irony and antiAmericanism movies like this are not only highly refreshing but also needed. It was just nice to see America portrayed as upstanding good guys for a change something you rarely if ever see on TV these days. Based on the subject matter the movie is perhaps more relevant today than it was back when it was released. They should release Death Before Dishonor back into theaters! Now wouldn't that be something? The great Fred Dryer is always cool whether he's initiating his new Marines which mainly involves a lot of beerchugging and grunting or chasingshooting the baddies. The movie is peppered with little standout moments and it all plays out as if an episode of Hunter took place in Iraq or Afghanistan. It was nice to see Dryer act out his personal vendetta with the full might of the 1980'sera military. Of course you know the main baddie is really bad when his name is Jihad. Kind of a dead giveaway that he might be a dangerous Arab terrorist. Of course there is the prerequisite machine gun shooting as well as the prerequisite torture but Dryer gets off some great lines and is a leader you can believe in.It was also cool to see a young Sasha Mitchell here in the ranks before his Kickboxer 2 1991 and Class of 1999 II 1994 and of course Step by Step fame. Joanna Pacula did the best she could in kind of an unnecessary role and an offcamera Franco Columbu is credited as body building coach. Because you're definitely going to need Columbu to work your quads so you can be in the proper shape to stop the terrorist bad guys. In all Death Before Dishonor is sort of What you see is what you get. It's a nice package of action where the good guys are good and the bad guys are bad. And in our uncertain confusing times that we live in today that's a comfort. Recommended.".

	onyx:emotionText "When Col. Halloran Keith assigns Gunnery Sgt. Burns Dryer and his young Marines  including Ramirez Gian and Ruggieri Mitchell  to the turbulent middle east country of Jemal despite the willingness of the local military to use their help at first they don't get to do too much. This is thanks to the politically correct outoftouch views of Ambassador Virgil Morgan Winfield who doesn't want to step on any toes. But Morgan and the rest of the Americans get a rude dose of reality in the form of a terrorist named Jihad Tarkington who is orchestrating acts of terror in the region. A photographer Elli Baumann Pacula is documenting his rise to power. When he and his goons kidnap some of Burns' men including Halloran Burns decides to take matters into his own hands and becomes a oneman army bent on revenge! Will he face death dishonor or NEITHER? Find out today! Death Before Dishonor is a classic example of the Reaganera patriotism film. It features good noble Americans doing heroic deeds  and in this era of cynicism irony and antiAmericanism movies like this are not only highly refreshing but also needed. It was just nice to see America portrayed as upstanding good guys for a change something you rarely if ever see on TV these days.

It's actually a really put together film that I wouldn't call spectacular but it treads the thin line between fair and good where it's closer to good. It has a different setting too the middle east. Sergeant Gunnery Burns Dryer is caught in an ambush his marines slaughtered his commanding officer Brian Family Affair Keith is kidnapped along with two escorting marines by merciless terrorists who's ways of getting answers are brutal. One marine's hand takes a hell of a drilling from a Mackita at a terroristsbitch's hand. A nasty piece of role. When they go for the leg next he folds against that ever existing rule as well as his shamed C.O Death Before Dishonor. A great title. The ambush sequence is fantastically shot where at the end of it Dryer yells s..t after jumping from a bridge into a gully his jeep he evacuates prior exploding. There's some other good action pieces too that makes great use of location. Some of the violence is raw but this is one of those better action pieces a two week runner that's not that far fetched as you would think. Joanna Pacula remember her co stars as a bold photographer who first gets on Dryer's bad side a side you don't want to be on.

DEATH BEFORE DISHONOR is the quintessential onesided We're good they're bad action film. Not since John Wayne's THE GREEN BERETS 1968 have I seen a film so amazingly biased.The scariest thing about DEATH BEFORE DISHONOR is the film's politics. The film is so glaringly jingoistic that it landed itself on the Worst List of the book Reed Bad Arabs How Hollywood Vilifies a People. While set in the fictional country of Jemal it is quite obvious who these guys fighting Israel are supposed to be. And who the good guys are. While discussing the complex problems in the Middle East Ellie asks Burns Are you the kind of person who knows what is exactly right and what is wrong? Yes replies Burns before he tells her don't get us mad. DEATH BEFORE DISHONOR is the kind of film where multiple bad guys can't hit the hero granted his underlings do die for the cause with machine guns but he can blow them up with a rocket launcher while driving a car. Where a by the book bureaucrat finds out the hard way via car bomb how savage these people really are. I think The Phantom of the Movies summed it up best in his review when he said it may well be the best 1943 war movie made in 1987. It would be funny if it weren't so darn frightening.Actually there is a bit of fun to be had with DEATH BEFORE DISHONOR. Director Leonard a veteran stuntman crafts some nice car chases with a rather nice car stunt at the film's end. The film definitely holds its own against its contemporaries such as THE DELTA FORCE 1986 in that regard. Dryer with visions of Eastwood in HEARTBREAK RIDGE 1986 dancing in his head is amazingly bland as the tough as nails Marine. Watching him drag around here it is hard to believe he carried a TV series for so many seasons. You can tell he was hoping for a cross over opportunity into theatrical features but failed miserably. But there is something inherently funny in his featureless performance. Finally fans of what in the world moments should also keep an eye out for the scene where Brian Keith being photographed by terrorists gives them the fingerwith his ring finger!".

The movie has an interesting cast Brian Keith Joanna Pacula Paul Winfield and Sasha Mitchell but all of these counterparts are mainly wasted in favor of Fred Dryer's charismaless performance which consists of grunting and looking deeply ticked off. The movie seems to live in a timeless vortex where repetition rules the day. Everything about the movie is tired and clichd but the details are so groan inducingly lame and so absurd you just keep rolling your eyes in disdain. All of this would be enjoyable had Death Before Dishonor contained some punch in the action sequences but unfortunately these one sided action sequences feature a three digit body count on one side while only one good guy dies. At this type of ratio it is no wonder the movie went into obscurity. out of 4Bad".

Lets just say it might have been good when I was 12 but seeing it now it didn't entertain.Its basically a poor mans Heartbreak Ridge with Dryer playing the grizzled lead who turns into Rambo come the end.

	schema:reviewBody "I'm so honored to see I'm one of the 3 women who have rated DOA Final on the IMDb that I feel compelled to comment. Look Ma I'm an arcanetrashcinema hound! Yippee! Right. Having seen all three DOA films in one evening at a triplefeature this is what happens when you live in a small French city and only one cinema in town shows subtitled films I'm in a terrific mood because the movies were tons of fun. More fun than I'd been expecting because Miike films seem to come accompanied with user comments like Don't bring a girl to this. Thanks guys. Anyway DOA Final is sadly easily the weakest of the trilogy. After DOA 1 which is a nutso gutsy genrejumping yakuza tale and DOA 2 which pretends to be a yakuza tale for ten minutes and then turns into a Wim Wenders film and a good one too this last entry apparently wants to be science fiction. But alas it just can't cut the mustard.Sho Aikawa is the bright point  as effortlessly unclassifiably entertaining here as he is in the first two DOAs. With his bad bleach job crackily teenage voice tracksuit and sneakers and zen spaciness he's as counterintuitive and appealing as you'd expect in his role as a battle cyborg or replicant named Ryo. If I could just watch him hang out with nineyearolds for two hours that might be worth the admission price. But even a blond Sho Aikawa is no Rutger Hauer and he can't make this film work.The SF premise is of the most wornout sort  an authority figure is making people take antifertility drugs to stop them having children. Oh no! The allbusiness authoritarian hand of the state is placed in opposition to the natural world of human instinct family bonds and lush jungle backdrops! That's enough to make a scifi movie right? Throwing in a band of sexfriendly rebels doesn't help Terence Yin and Maria Chen seem to have been cast more for their attractively Eurasian features and ability to look good in camos than for their acting talent. Admittedly it's a tough trick to shuttle between three languages but Yin's acting in English is just winceworthy and Chen isn't convincing even when she doesn't speak.The pompadoured Riki Takeuchi is fun as always here in the role of a police chief caught in a moral dilemma about whether to enforce his boss's orders. But returning to that SF premise we have the problem of an unaddressed WHY? What's the motivating engine behind all this evildrug MadMaxtyperebellion antifamily stuff? Miike's very handwavy about this  It's an overpopulation thing  but and this is the bad part he's none too subtle about suggesting the badguy mayor's obvious homosexuality has a lot to do with it. Thanks Takashi Miike! I guess homosexuals really are the ultimate threat to the survival of humanity huh? I mean come on this crap went out with Dune. Watch Miike associate homosexuality with pedophilia decadence pastel scarves and  a sign of true evil  saxophone concerts in order to see why this movie has to get a threepoint deduction for catastrophic moronicity.This is the only one of the three DOA films I wouldn't see again. It's not without its bright spots but there are far too many negatives to make it hold together. In the little quality meter in my head I was rating it as low as a 410 right up until the final five minutes. Then I started laughing my head off. The bizarreness of Miike's wrapup pushes the whole experience up to a 510. But you know if an outofleftfield conclusion improves the filmic experience you can be pretty sure there's something wrong with the movie to begin with. Unfortunately in this case there's quite a lot.".

It's not without its bright spots but there are far too many negatives to make it hold together. In the little quality meter in my head I was rating it as low as a 410 right up until the final five minutes. Then I started laughing my head off. The bizarreness of Miike's wrapup pushes the whole experience up to a 510. But you know if an outofleftfield conclusion improves the filmic experience you can be pretty sure there's something wrong with the movie to begin with. Unfortunately in this case there's quite a lot.";

	schema:reviewBody "While Miike Takashi has not written any of the films he has directed his style and formula or lack thereof has made him a force to be reckoned with in modern filmmaking. He takes the most mundane of stories and scenarios and gives it a fresh jolt of adrenaline and emotion making his films seem as fresh and as original as anything by David Lynch or Stanley Kubrick. Dead or Alive Hanzaisha was about a cop and a criminal struggling against each other and ultimately destroying both their families and themselves. Dead or Alive 2 Tbsha was about two hitmen rediscovering their innocence only to lose it again and ultimately destroy themselves. Now we have Dead or Alive Final the third and final installment in a trilogy of films that are unrelated to each other...and yet they've all got something in common besides the director and the two main actors.Dead or Alive Final plunges us into Yokohama of 2346 where a homosexual mayor has outlawed human breeding and keep srigid control through use of birth control pills and his chief enforcer Officer Honda Takeuchi Riki. Standing in the mayor's way is a group of rebels led by Fong Terence Yin and Jun Josie Ho who now have a new ally a replicant by the name of Ryo Aikawa Sho still sporting his cool blond hair. Immediately the Blade Runner references run rampant right down to the terminology. The use of the word replicant to describe Ryo the omnipresent floating blimp with the huge TV screens flashing advertisements the decrepit rainswept environment of a ravaged city even the characters themselves all homages to Blade Runner. Oh but there are other scifi nods too. Elements of THX1138 The Matrix The Terminator etc...it's all there making Dead or Alive Final almost a satire and sometimes a parody of scifi cinema.There's more than just the humorous nod to scifi going on. Yet again Miike has given us a few thrills via his Don't expect anything style. While there is nothing truly shocking in this film compared to its predecessors save for the ending there is still the nod to Kitano's films i.e. beautiful scenery long shots of characters and even a few beach scenes. But while Kitano is poetic Miike is like a jackhammer hitting you fullon in the face with his own brand of filmmaking. The story is nothing new and even the characters are easily understood and familiar but there is something about Miike's gritty take on the conventions of genres and cinema that gives it an originality. Who else but Miike could make three completely different and unrelated films and tie them all together into a package that is both confusing and cohesive? Okay so the ending still threw me for a loop but it was typical of Miike.In the end we are left with many of the same themes...the predominant one being that some people just never quit and in the end it will destroy them. Honda's son is kidnapped and even after he is returned he is still hellbent on stopping the rebels. Ryo could easily back out of the fight and go on with his life but he can't. The evil dictator could easily allow people to live their lives as they see fit but he refuses to relent. Even a scene where a rebel is given the choice to either die or take the birth control drug he decides to die for a cause that is pretty much lost. In all three Dead or Alive movies nobody quits...and as a result everybody dies. The people who do know when to back down are the ones who survive. Ryo and Honda can't quit...and in the end they meet for their final showdown which resonates their endings in the previous two films. The tie in is not as neat as it could have been but again it's typical of Miike to give us something we really would not have expected and at the same time that it's shocking it makes a strange kind of sense. Dead or Alive Final ties in all three movies but not in the way that you might think. It yet again presents the same themes but from a completely different angle. It's like telling the same story...but not the same story. The idea is the same but the details are different. There is the essence of the Dead or Alive films and is probably the essence of Miike's films. They're nothing new...and yet they are. It's not for everybody but it's certainly different.".

Show Aikawa and Riki Takeuchi are back again for the lead roles but this time the movie thrusts us forward 300 years or so into the future... post apocalypse.Riki plays a tough cop an enforcer for the corrupt city's extreme police policies and Show plays a drifter who hooks up with a bunch of the city's oppressed rebels. The film must have been shot in Hong Kong as most of the rest of the cast are Cantonese speakers with Terence Yin and Josie Ho being the most recognisable faces. There's also a HK stunt crew on hand for the films action sequences which are very cool in a HKviaMiike style.This could be fodder for a dreadful low budget Bmovie but in Miike's hands it of course becomes something more interesting. It's quite a slow thoughtful film that meanders along and doesn't try to force anything down the viewer's throat. Characters are rounded and interesting and the plot an interesting but fairly loose framework for the story to be hung on.All in all a fairly low key effort until the action scenes which show Miike's increasing prowess at directing and choreographing very nice action. Watching the short making of with Show  Riki in wire rigs is really fun  you can tell they were having a great time The finale of the film tries to tie together the 3 Dead Or Alive movies which is quite unnecessary because each one is really self contained. Miike's explanation of the connection is very funny though and caps the series off quite nicely.Not as deep or well developed as DOA2 not as outrageous and intense as DOA1... still another good Miike movie though.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dead or Alive  Finale.and it starts so well a dirigible with neon signs beneath floats over a desolate city street the sky is yellow from pollution? and the underclass run from the reproduction police in Yokohama 2364. However the image of Blade Runner meets 1984 set for a change during the day is quickly dispelled by the obvious lack of budget and thin plot that would be hard pressed to fill half an hour let alone three times that length. I haven't seen either of the preceding Dead or Alive films but the flashbacks in this the same good guy  bad guy fighting epic Street Fighter style battles throughout history make you feel that this is probably the least of the trilogy. Having not seen the previous two but encouraged that the finale could stand on its own I went purely as a fan of the director. Miike Takeshi is best known for his sublime thriller Audition a Japanese and far better counterpoint to Basic Instinct that would put any straight man off blind dates for life. Also his stylistically experimental but totally gripping Triad trilogy makes for diverting viewing. However this film only comes alive no pun intended when there are special effects on screen or blistering kung fu. These aren't even terribly imaginative but at least the bullet time shoot outs are often played tongue in cheek and are done with considerable gusto and flair. Also the bizarre technique of varying film speeds throughout the movie perhaps because old films were shot at 16fps? is irritating rather than an innovative device. Having beautifully depicted the relationship between an old gangster and a young boy in Rainy Dog Miike covers much the same ground again in this film. However anyone who's seen Robocop 3 or Soldier we're thinking of starting a bad scifi support group knows cyborg  kid relationships normally come across like a lead balloon. Here this boy and his robot make an amusing double act but not one that can sustain audience attention for any great period of time. Even the nice lietmotif of old celluloid doesn't really go anywhere it just seems like the director had recently seen Cinema Paradiso and so poached an idea from it. Also the undercurrent of homophobia throughout the film is somewhat disturbing  why can't we have a heroic male lead with an attractive boyfriend rather than the slimy mayor who deserves to die. A charity comic published in the eighties featured a ludicrous parody of Robocop by Frank Miller ironically as a homophobic robotic penis who fought crime. Astonishingly this movie ends exactly the same way honestly! but not in a manner that is played entirely for laughs or satire but rather in a way that leaves a nasty taste in the mouth I can't believe I just wrote that. Occasionally entertaining then it does make me intrigued to see the prequels but this film is one to file under 'must try harder' rather than 'must see'. For a far more entertaining and coincidentally gaypositive over the top Japanese scifi kungfu film check out the amazing Wild Zero if it ever gets released on video  in the cinema in this country".

Part of me felt cheated part of me confused but mostly I was just laughing. A lot of the film is quite boring though the best scenes bookend the film while the rest is far too slow. Takashi Miike has always mined the sexual motifs beneath male violence in action films and this film with the exception of Gozu reinforces this theme more than any other. Sex and violence are two pretty basic themes but like Cronerbergwho the jazz interludes may be a homage to ala Naked LunchMiike is able to show where the two connect to hilarious an oddly cohesive effect.".

Part of me felt cheated part of me confused but mostly I was just laughing. A lot of the film is quite boring though the best scenes bookend the film while the rest is far too slow. Takashi Miike has always mined the sexual motifs beneath male violence in action films and this film with the exception of Gozu reinforces this theme more than any other. Sex and violence are two pretty basic themes but like Cronerbergwho the jazz interludes may be a homage to ala Naked LunchMiike is able to show where the two connect to hilarious an oddly cohesive effect.";

	schema:reviewBody "The original Dead or Alive 1999 was a straight to video policeYakuza crossover that opened with a rockvideo style montage and climaxed with a scene of jawdropping implausibility. It took on the clichs and characteristics of the usual police dramas that we're familiar with but infused them with all manner of bold and brash directorial flourishes and much in the way of attention grabbing shock sequences. This second follow up  which takes the same lead actors from the first two DOA films and drops then into a whole new setting as entirely new characters giving us a sequel in the thematic sense alone  tones down the excessive violence and the outr spectacle even further than the preceding Dead or Alive 2 Birds 2000  to give us an oddly uneven film that strives to tie together the various ideas of destiny identity karma and reincarnation whilst simultaneously offering us a strange combination of the worlds of Ridley Scott Wong KarWai Shinya Tsukamoto and Takashi Kitano respectively. What we have then is an increasingly odd construction  part action film part cyberpunk pastiche  bringing to a close this always daring Miike Takashidirected metatrilogy in a way that will please all fans... without necessarily blowing them away.With these factors in mind I would definitely agree with the general online consensus  which considers this to be a stepback from the first two films in particular the lyrical splendour of Birds which could easily be listed as one of the best films of Miike's career thus far  with the film in question seriously lacking that particular work's emphasis on character or indeed the first film's kaleidoscopic disregard for logic and convention. What we have instead is a fun little film that meanders along from one cyberpunk clich to the next occasionally coasting on a wave of broad humour or a particularly nice directorial flourish such as the title of the film appearing in the background on a giant CGI gunship or the shootout in the alleyway that is incredibly well choreographed. None of this really adds up to a satisfactory whole however with the film for me seeming to be far too disjointed and directionless while the pacing on a number of occasions can seriously drag.Unlike much of Miike's work Dead or Alive Final can be vaguely described as science fiction taking place in a post apocalyptic Yokohama where the population is kept under rigid control by a halfcrazed homosexual general and his army of secret police. Riki Takeuchi Fudoh A New Generation is the hard boiled chief of one such unit locking horns with Sho Aikawa's Gozu mellowed out drifter who has taken up with the gang of idealistic rebels that have kidnapped Takeuchi's son. However in true DOA style the plot of the film is mostly nonsensical ripped off from a variety of other sources such as THX1138 Blade Runner Tetsuo The Iron ManBody Hammer Terminator 2 Judgement Day and The Matrix with the whole thing used as nothing more than a concept that links these two continually warring characters thematically as well as metaphorically. As a result there's no real dramatic tension though a brief Terminator 2 like relationship between Aikawa's replicant character Ry the wife of the rebelleader and a wandering young boy suggest hidden depths and subtextual notions of family and humanity they're soon quickly replaced by more action and sporadic attempts at humour.There are still a number of things to recommend however chiefly the film's visual design which is presented in an Edward Hopperesquire colour scheme of autumn yellows vivid greens and the occasional cool blue. There are also a couple of fairly impressive action sequences that draw more on physical combat as opposed to the gun play that we've come to expect from Miike's work and the DOA series as a whole with the scene in which replicant Ry has to escape from Officer Honda and his gang of armed mercenaries whilst also protecting a young boy caught in up in the midst of the action being an obvious jawdropping standout. Once again there are fine performances from the two leads with Takeuchi reprising his role as the sort of antagonistlike character to Aikawa lovable rouge while the supporting characters padded out by a largely Chinese cast and a few characters that actually speak in brokenEnglish help to lend a sense of credibility to Miike's largely 21st century depiction of the far off future recalling Jean Luc Godard's retrofuturist classic Alphaville as well as Michael Winterbottom's subsequent Code 46.What follows is all in good fun moving from scenes of staggering action to more gentle moments between Ry and his adopted family with Miike and his scriptwriter making subtle allusions to that old scifi staple of the robots being more human than the humans. Sadly none of these ideas really come to anything substantial though with the film ultimately ending up as a visually impressive slice of scifi hokum with lots of Miikelike humour thrown in for good measure. Nothing here comes close to matching the level of brilliance that Miike has previously established  not only with the preceding Dead or Alive 2 Birds but of course with great films like Shinjuku Triad Society Audition Gozu The Bird People in China and Visitor Q  but diehard fans of the director are sure to find something to enjoy if not the comical sparring of Takeuchi and the always enjoyable Aikawa then certainly the rampaging sight of a gigantic DayGlo robot with a purple penis head. Yes you have been warned...".

	schema:reviewBody "Dead or Alive Final the movie that supposedly brings together the three films in the very loose Dead or Alive trilogy and connected mostly by its stars Riki Takeiuchi and Sho Aikawa and that each film has its share of bizarroworld fixtures and neuroses and heaps of violence is admittedly the weakest of the lot. That none of the three films ends up being a disappointment is less a testament to the creativity of the material but to the poundforpound guts that director Takashi Miike takes with the surroundings and the material. Here he presents an overtly dystopian future however lowkey where a homosexual mayordictator Richard Chen has the entire village drugged except for a group of rebels. There's also replicants robots in this year of 2346 one of them is Ryo Aikawa a robot of complete lethal skill but also with the capacity to love and learn and so forth. Then a cop Takeshi Takeiuchi happens to be the mayor's top guard. But things start to unravel on both sides Ryo teaming up with the rebels and Takeshi with his employer though bloodsoaked mishaps like a hostage tradeoff gone bad and with Takeshi finding out his wife and son are robots not done in an Alien mood mind you just suddenly as if in a the power went out and that he himself is one as well. And it all leads up to one last inexplicable showdown between the two men.Strange that there's yet another film where Miike has peaks and valleys here sometimes finding that middle ground of success where science fiction can have some meaning to it. But there really isn't anything to take from this story except that the mayordictator is a dingbat with no backstory who gets his rocks off making sure his drug stops couples from getting pregnant and that everything remains under control. He also has along with him his love slave I'd guess in the hilarious nonspeaking part of a saxophone player who also doubles sometimes as a human fixture when not plugging away the moody blues. Meanwhile we get the conventional sides to Ryo and Takeshi's stories and they're never uninteresting just not totally convincing enough to hold interest. Of course Miike isn't above having some fun like when Takeshi plops Michelle Maria Chen in to the water to get her to swim after a nearassassination attempt on the mayor or in having the original rebel leader speaking English for no good reason at all. There's even a playful homage to old scifi cartoons at the start of the film. But there's nothing very compelling substancewise with the exception of Takeshi's minor turns at becoming good midway through the film helping one couple get by with clearance to have a kid and mostly Miike's strengths this time are purely stylistically and in the choice of locations and sets.It's like a grungy Japanese Alphaville where everything still has a contemporary feel through all of the special effects. And I really liked the yellowgreen tint Miike used through the movie as it impacted very well in outdoor scenes and added just enough grittiness in the indoor scenes. But as for peaks and valleys one sees this ever more clearly and the scifi movie channel level of visual effects with maybe a few more dollars put into it during the climax. This contains some of the funniest material in the most delirious Freudian sensibility from the director even if it has to get started by unbearable contrivance the way that Ryo and Takeshi finally meet up is sort of random and just a means for the producers to try and cheaply tie together the past two films when it wasn't needed. On the other hand in terms of the sheer guilty entertainment value of a flick like Miike's where one sees something totally unexpected and very crudely sexual it ranks right up there with the best scenes in Happiness of the Katakuris and Visitor Q. Overall Dead or Alive Final is a cheesy 90 minute effort that doesn't take itself TOO seriously and is better off all the more for its wicked contrivances militaristic decay and cultural hangups put on pulplevel display.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a film that has to be taken in context. It shouldn't be seen unless you've seen the first two films but the sort of people seeing this film will probably own the box set or at least know someone who does. And you shouldn't go in expecting Blade Runner the films budget doesn't stretch quite that far and it's a far more zany ride.Essentially the film is a science fiction set in future Yokohama shot in Hong Kong as is obvious about a society where it's illegal to procreate. Sho Aikawa reprises a similar role from Dead or Alive 2 and Riki Takeuchi is a detective for the birth control cops. Takashi Miike isn't one to give all of his reasons to you on a platter but one can assume that the law on procreation enforced by giving people the pill is there because of over population increased life spans and so forth. Interestingly the dialogue in the film is mainly Cantonese whilst Sho and Riki who play their parts as always brilliantly speak Japanese and a few speak English. People have criticised the English as being wooden but I found no problems with it. Also another person found the homosexuality themes throughout the film to be offensive said that Takashi Miike was antihomosexual. He may very well be and not all artists have to be leftwing but I can't see this film as an insult to homosexuals. He merely calls back philosophies of ancient Greece when homo or bisexuality was more common. The film contains similar proportions of actionpacked and poignant moments to DoA 2 although in this film the action is more martialarts based and are done in a very good Hong Kong style. The cinematography in the film is very nice on the eyes with symmetrical shots a good control on colours to give the air a polluted look and it's nice to see uncut lengthy shots that are so rare in Hollywood these days. Basically there's a lot to like in this film a good sense of humour exciting action and some very beautiful moments. It's a great finish to the series. You could criticise it for being a bit cheesy but isn't that part of the charm?".

Thematically it's similar to the previous films but the story and point of the movie get muddled somewhere along the way. The ending is quite nuts and reminded me of TETSUO. By the way did you know that the director of TETSUO played Ichi's father figure in Ichi The Killer?".

The prologue reminds me of the one for the original theatrical version of THX1138 the trailer for BUCK ROGERS here it was clips from some early Japanese SF TV show. Then the opening shot of the city in 2345 has the dragon blip flying overhead with a billboard reminding one immediately of BLADERUNNER. The BLADERUNNER aspect comes evenmore pronounced when we meet the hero who is called a Replicant He is blond haired and is called Ryo a homage to Roy Batty Rutger Hauer's character in BLADERUNNER?. A battle scene soon ensues which reminds one immediately of THE MATRIX. The government forcing the population to take drugs is like THX1138 and the chief enforcer while looks like a cross between Elvis and Dan Ackroyd turns out to be a robot very much like the TERMINATOR. The end battle reminds one of TERMINATOR 2 and the end result is hilarious. Probably not one of the best SF films out there but is enjoyable certainly a lot more enjoyable than tripe like BATTLEFIELD EARTH.".

What you actually get is a slowish rather beautiful enigmatic science fiction film rather like a Philip K Dick novel in that its central themes are love and the problem of how to be human in a mechanical world. The film borrows the notion of 'replicants' from Blade Runner I can't remember if they were called that in PKD's source novel but takes the idea further than that highly overrated film bringing us characters who don't realise that they're replicants battling replicants who are becoming human ending with a strange metalmorphosis straight out of 'Tetsuo'. The story moves along smoothly but never really kicks into high gear. We're in 2346 in Yokohama where the gay Mayor Wu has made the consumption of a birth control drug that destroys love a compulsory act. Babies born due to defiance of the law are destoyed Herodstyle. Riki Takeuchi who is getting a bit porky these days! is Wu's enforcer. Puzzlingly he has a small son. He goes into action against some revolutionaries and has all of his most cherished illusions destroyed...Visually the film is quite lovely even though it seems to have been made as per usual with Takashi very speedily. It also seems to have been shot on some kind of video process which doesn't hold up well on the big screen but won't bother anybody watching it at home.The ending is unfathomable even by Takashi's standards and rather abrupt. Still there's nobody else like him...".

	schema:headline " Takashi Miike's sciencefiction opera";
	schema:reviewBody "Dead or Alive Final is the third and last instalment in Takashi Miike's Dead or Alive trilogy. The only point this film has in common with its predecessors are the facts that all films are directed by Takashi Miike and feature Japanese Vcinema cult actors Show Aikawa and Riki Takeuchi in the lead roles. Dead or Alive Final isn't even a classic gangster movie but rather a dystopian sciencefiction movie. It's not as quirky explicit and brutal as the first instalment of the trilogy but more vivid surprising and experimental than the second movie. Considering the long list of characters and balanced mixture between the first two instalments it makes me think of Takashi Miike's third part of the Black Society trilogy where Ley Lines had a very similar approach if compared to its predecessors Shinjuku Triad Society and Rainy Dog.The story line is quite unusual even by Takashi Miike's experimental standards. The movie is set in the year 2346 in Yokohama where people of several cultures coexist. The movie's dialogues are in Cantonese English and Japanese but different people seem to understand one another effortlessly despite speaking different languages which proves that society has become very educated multicultural and polyglot. However after numerous violent wars in the past Yokohama's mayor has established radical birth control to prevent further conflicts. It has actually become illegal to give birth to children and homosexuality is praised as a political and social ideology. People are forced to take pills to suppress their desire to have sexual intercourse and give birth to children. Those who disobey are hunted down. Riki Takeuchi plays a cop that is hunting down social outcast living in hiding to have families. Show Aikawa plays a humanlike robot who gets in touch with one of these communities by pure coincidence after saving a young kid that gets attacked in front of him in a restaurant. The two characters end up fighting each other but soon realize that they have more things in common than they would have thought.Among the movie's strengths one has to note a quite quirky and surprising story line that ends in a very surprising way such as the first part of the trilogy. The acting performances by Show Aikawa and Riki Takeuchi are outstanding and they have great chemistry on screen. The supporting actors are also doing a great job. Richard Chung convinces particularly as manipulative gay mayor and Josie Ho shines as female rebel that has to find a sense of life after most members of her clan got betrayed and assassinated. The settings of the film are often abandoned broken and dirty which is typical for Takashi Miike's movies and give this film a slightly gloomy atmosphere. The sky is mostly yellowbrownish which adds an interesting tone as well. The movie is obviously inspired by several dystopian sciencefiction stories. The pills that suppress the will to reproduce could make you think of Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 while the presence of robots is closely inspired by Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?. Movies such as Blade Runner and The Matrix seem to have influenced parts of the script as well. On the other side Takashi Miike's movie isn't a cheap copy of these wellknown stories and he manages to add his own touch to it thanks to the great acting performances quirky story line and quite vivid action sequences filmed by local Hong Kong choreographers.The most negative element of the film is that it rarely looks futuristic. You can still see old cars cell phones from the early millennium and simplistic weapons that seem out of place in the twentyfourth century. While the action sequences look great the special effects are very artificial and look as if they were taken from an old manga. The movie would be more convincing if it took place in the near future than in the twentyfourth century.In the end each of the three instalments of Takashi Miike's Dead or Alive trilogy complements one another perfectly and shows the diversified skills of its director and main actors. It's a matter of taste whether you prefer a fastpaced and brutal gangster thriller a thoughtful drama or a vivid sciencefiction movie. I liked all these movies but I would probably prefer the first for its intensity put this third film in second place for its quirky creativity and might put the second movie last because of its minor lengths in the middle section. Still fans of Japanese cinema should be familiar with the entire trilogy and purchase the excellent boxed set by Arrow Video and also try to buy Arrow Video's boxed set of Takashi Kiike's Black Society trilogy.".

It is a marvelous piece light and yet moving filled with wonderful visuals a great performance by Jack McGowran and a marvelous and unfortunately outofprint score by everyone's favorite Beatle George. The synopsis above just doesn't do justice to the film.  Yes it's about a daffy old guy who peers in on a lovely young woman living next door but there's nothing creepy or pathetic about it.  In fact he's actually quite a bit a of a dashing and romantic figure in his own detached weird way.  One of the most notable things about the film is the art direction done by the bandart collective The Fool.  An obscure folk group sort of a lesser Incredible String Band they made the most of what was most likely a thin budget by pouring every ounce of energy into creating two amazing sets for the adjacent apartments of the old man and the young model.  They are without a doubt two of the coolest looking places to live I have ever seen in a movie I would give my eyeteeth to live in either one of those flats and they form as much of a part of the main characters as the portrayal by the actors themselves.  The old scientist lives in CelticMedieval warren inspired by PreRaphaelite design and the young model lives in a mod Sixties psychedelicglam environment suffused with overtones of 20's30's nostalgia. Both apartments then are filled with a yearning for the past and so the old man becomes no more of a romanticist than the girl despite his age. He is actually quite dashing in his cape and tuxedo when engaging in some of his later escapades like some bandit out of a Fantomas picture.  No this movie isn't about a pathetic old guy lusting after a lithe young thing. It's about a few other things more interesting and perhaps more touching but you'll have to find out for yourself.  In any case it's a nice little treat worth finding if you can.".

Known primarily today for George Harrison's psych rock and droningraga soundtrack Wonderwall is a souvenir of swinging London that should just manage to please modern viewers...even those who are not lysergically enhanced. Every one of Collins' numerous fantasy episodes and every glimpse into that apartment next door is like a peek into a psychedelic colorsaturated wonderland. Whether Collins' neighbors are engaged in a photo shoot a pot party or a bout of lovemaking director Joe Massot mines psychedelic gold and costume designer Jocelyn Rickards decks one and all in retinapleasing finery. Jane Birkin here plays a mod model who is the chief object of Collins' obsessed fantasies yes she HAD played another model just two years before in Antonioni's Blowup. Wonderwall may bring to mind bits of other films such as Peeping Tom and 1985's Brazil mixed in with some Monty Python and even the front cover of Spirit's classic 1970 album 12 Dreams of Dr. Sardonicus. It drags at times and even this director's cut shorn of a dozen or so minutes of previous footage feels a bit padded. Still I found it for the most part a colorful way to spend 73 minutes. As the always pithy Michael Weldon puts it in my beloved Psychotronic Video Guide it's good for the 'swinging London' fashions and the music. Blotter is optional.".

An aging nutty professor and OCD paper hoarder finds a peephole in his cluttered apartment that glows like starlight set within a wall mural painting of a crowned goddess in the sky  When he looks thru the hole he sees an otherworldly beautiful oftunder dressed young woman named Penny Lane played by lovely blankfaced cipher Jane Birkin who was equally blank in Antonioni's equally obtuse movie BlowUp.Penny Lane seems to be perpetually posing for 60s soft core porn mags cigarette commercials and stewardess ads alone andor with equally under dressed ladyfriends.One one side of the wall the Old Prof's side it's just another day the barber shaves another customer the banker looking in  On the OTHER side of the peephole it's the 24hour freak out channel with freak out music kicking in every time the old man peeps at the fetishistic nylon leg shows and Hefnerfueledacidsoaked visions of a Wild and Wonky World According To Playboy.Opening more peepholes seems to open more worlds  or are these just the Old Prof's daydreams? In one trippy vision the old Prof improbably sees himself outdoors battling a teenage Superman with weapons like giant ciggies and lipstick tubes. Or at an effeminate cowboy riding a plastic rocking horse and talking on the phone or a hippie mermaid chick floating on a sea of polyester fabric while brushing her hair or a Perplexing Planet of Preposterous Sunglasses.He peeps most often at an ongoing idyllic Dionysian hippie party jam with fluteplaying flower children and beautiful dancing gypsies with almost EVERYone smoking something either ciggies or ??. The smoking in various other wonder worlds ranges from small glass pipes to Chongsized roaches and giant octopus hookahs  Amusingly the Old Prof himself in his world is proudly a nonsmoker  tho one wonders about how labcustomized his beloved sugar cubes may be given his increasingly bizarre visions thru the Wonder wall.The Old Prof becomes so obsessed that for awhile he seems to stop shaving or sleeping or doing anything else aside from peeping. Sorta presaging the advent of 500channel TV feeds it could be said  When he strays too far from the wall  like when he goes to work at the lab one day if only to study up on alternate realities and gaze lovingly at Penny Lane thru his microscope ?! he suddenly becomes black and white. As does the world around him. Only the wonder wall can color his world....At some point one of the wonder wall visions appears to actually be the adjoining room of a young hippie couple  or is it? Everything on the Other Side is just a colorful and hallucinogenic as his other visions.When he realizes he's fallen in love with the young girl  or at least with her magical hippie wonderland  he manages to find a magic Alex doorway and dramatically leap into her world apparently by dressing as a tophat magician and fondling his magic wand don't ask.... In summation  glad I watched it. Glad it was restored especially the sonically engaging soundtrack and glad it came out on DVD. Also glad the hippies  and Hollywood's brief trippy obsession with them  pretty much died with the Beatles.I'll probably never have occasion to spin this inexplicable tripfest again unless under the influence of the Old Prof's suspect sugar cubes but I'm glad I finally got to checkout this funky flashback 40 years after it first came and went ".

It looks absolutely fabulous with superb costumes and stunning sets. As for locations I eventually tracked down the reservoirs at West Molesey as the primary source with Beesborough being the primary one and I assume the associated pumping station was that used both for the workplace scenes and the later rather manic cycle machine scenes. I had never realised the close connection between the Beatles and Roman Polanski but writer Gerard Brach Cul de Sac What? Fearless Vampire Killers and the film under discussion seems to have been the main link although actor Ian Quarrier and director Joe Masot were apparently big on the 'scene' during 1967 and 1968. George Harrison made considerable contributions to British cinema of the time but his more extreme Indian influences to this soundtrack are probably the only let down. Fortunately director Massot has assembled an alternative cut of the film using the original Wonderwall sessions and this makes for a much more acceptable viewing. Jack MacGowran much favoured by Samuel Beckett but also appeared in Cul de Sac and Fearless Vampire Killers is perfect in the role of obsessive mad professor cum obsessive peeping tom. Which brings us to Jane Birkin who doesn't do too much in this she doesn't even speak but is 196768 London personified. She has that 'look' she can wear those clothes or not and moves with a grace that almost takes the breath away. Something between a butterfly and a gazelle. she floats through the film seemingly effortlessly her role simply to move about with or without clothes and to 'react' to others.

A lot of the movie is just Collins alone so there isn't much dialogue in fact there isn't much of anything that happens during this movie. He starts to look through the wall and see women dancing and doing other things. Then when he starts to make his view window bigger he finds there is a brick wall behind it and it's the wall itself. I say stay away from this movie there is no point to it.I'm sorry if this offends anyone but it's just my opinion.".

On the contrary this is a great film! It's funny lighthearted and brilliantly cast. The story focuses on Ecki a young man who works in a bakery in a very small rural community and plays football in his local team. When his teammembers find out that he is gay they throw him out of the team. With the help of his sister he subsequently tries to form an allgay footballteam to challenge his old team in a match. And this journey through toughguy town Dortmund is really really funny! The incredibly talented cast especially leading man Maximilian Brckner pull every scene off and make it believable. OK there are clichs in this film but they are also made fun of and not taken seriously at the same time. The movie also features a love story between Ecki and Sven his cute teammate and these two characters are totally clichfree.This is a very good film and I recommend it to anyone who wants to have a really good laugh see really good acting and a really touching love story  all in one film!".

It is that kind of movie that makes you groan 'Oh no not again' but then ends up making you feel warm and sentimental despite yourself! Ecki a very charismatic and hunky Maximilian Brckner has grown up in a rural town the son of a baker and a committed soccer fan since childhood. Now as a young man he is sought after by his girlfriend Cordula Melody Sitta but is unable to respond to her advances.

It is that kind of movie that makes you groan 'Oh no not again' but then ends up making you feel warm and sentimental despite yourself! Ecki a very charismatic and hunky Maximilian Brckner has grown up in a rural town the son of a baker and a committed soccer fan since childhood. Now as a young man he is sought after by his girlfriend Cordula Melody Sitta but is unable to respond to her advances.

While those messages rarely reach those that could use the lesson the films can often be a bit of fun with heroes that are easy to root for and bad guys just as easy to hate. Shelly Horman's new Guys and Balls Mnner wie wir is a decent one.

His longtime nemesis Udo Carlo Lubjek takes charge and get him kicked off the team and his parents are shocked by the news of their son's sexual orientation. Parting words between the team and their ex goalie bring a challenge for Ecki to field a team of homosexual for a match against his old team.

The group includes a trio of leatherclad bikers a very feminine Turkish deli worker an extremely masculine lesbian a closet construction worker and a couple of Brazilian players. The broad spectrum of gay personality types including stereotypes could come off as amateur caricatures in lesser hands but Horman  crew do a fine job of compensating for the characters' lack of depth. The biker trio especially is shown with a light humor that comes at the expense of common perceptions of lifestyle leather queens rather than at the expense of the characters themselves. The dearth of character development isn't normally that big of a problem. Only when unnecessary melodrama is introduced does it intrude. Scenes between Rudolf Christian Berkel and his son tend to ring a bit false because we don't know much about either of them and the sudden conflict between Ecki's parents seems a bit out of place.In the city Ecki finds not only his sister Lisa Pothoff but also Sven David Rott a handsome hospital worker with looks and soccer skills to spare. As Ecki with the help of a drunken former soccer star for a coach works to make the team ready for the match he also must work to put his relationship with his parents back together. Will the team be better than everyone expected? Will Ecki's parents be able to transcend their prejudices? The answers are never really in doubt just as in any film of this type.That a film is a predictable bythenumbers formula doesn't necessarily mean it's no good. There is a reason that formula exist they sometimes work. A fun light comedy that's a bit stupid and a little romantic Guys and Balls is an example of one that does.".

He is then subsequently booted from his local soccer team. Angry he them challenges them to a soccer match made up by his soon to be allgay football squad. He leaves home and goes to live with his sister while assembling a rag tag group of gay men who are appalling at playing the game and comprise of every gay clich on the market. Still these stereotypes are not offensive mainly because all the players come across as such nice guys. Ecki also falls for Sven an attractive male nurse at the hospital where his sister works.

	schema:reviewBody "Mnner wie wir or Guys and Balls or Balls or Lattenknaller is a German movie from 2004 so this one is already 13 years old now. If you read some of the titles you can already exactly expect what you are in for. It is a mix of gaythemed film and football movie. The protagonist gets fired from his football team when they realize he is a homosexual. As a consequence he builds his own football team and plays against his former team in the end and of course you already know how it will go out. But predictability is the least of the problems this 100minute movie has. The biggest problem is of course the screenplay. It is packed with clichs and the action has nothing to do with realism. And I could list a 100 examples for it. What do you want to hear? A man never knows he was a homosexual until he lies close to a friend. A team of complete rookies wins against a team of trained football players. The gays show some movements and actions in play that nobody could ever put on display that has not played football for a long time. Random gays pop out left and right when he is looking for his teammates. He does not care about his newfound sexual identity but is all about this project and about revenge. Very likable huh? So yeah it is a really really bad movie and in my opinion it is tryhard comedies like this one or dramas as well which hurt the tolerance in our society a lot more than they help it. The acting in here is frequently over the top and the film itself just does not make any sense at all. If it's a comedy it's never funny despite the very visible and very failed attempts by the filmmakers to make us laugh. If it's a drama than it's never relevant or realistic. If it's a sports movie then the underdog element was elaborated on extremely poorly and that's the only aspect they even tried to make an impact with. It's very telling that writer Benedikt Gollhardt has never worked on another full feature film but has a lot of weak television stuff under his belt. So yeah there is not a single perspective from which you can enjoy this film or take it seriously at all. This is especially disappointing almost dangerous because this subject here gay people in sports is an important one and actually almost the only area in which discrimination against homosexuals is still present today more than a decade after this film came out. It's not in society in general in my opinion but maybe the depiction of the subject in films like this one is one reason why people are still very intolerant in this area. I don't think you should see this film. I gave it a major thumbsdown and it certainly is a contender for worst German movie of 2004.".

OK it might be a bit old  fashioned and predictable when it comes to portraying gay stereotypes but it is an affectionate and completely inoffensive film that passed an enjoyable 90 minutes or so for me. The film is populated by a cast of likable characters led by the sweet Maximillian Bruckner as 'Ecki' a young man who plays in goal for a smalltown football team and who is outed as gay by his teammates. The team and some of the townsfolk are particularly cruel to both Ecki and his parents following the 'outing'. The running gag of the old man coming into the family's bakery shop and telling 'gay' jokes is quite funny however. The film concentrates on Ecki's determination to put together a gay football team that can take on his tormentors and win. This leads to an enjoyable series of adventures in which his family particularly his father have to come to terms with his sexuality and in which he manages to find love along the way. Altogether a nice fairytale excuse the pun!  everyone even manages to live happily ever after! See it and enjoy!".

However the addition of David Rott Sven into the mix livens things up considerably.

The ancient stone is capable of resurrecting the Emperor Han and of pointing the way to ShangriLa and the eternal pool of life. When the couple reaches China they meet their son Alex O'Connell who has discovered the tomb of Han and Evelyn's brother Jonathan Carnahan. The O'Connells are betrayed by their friend Prof. Roger Wilson who is associated with General Yang. Yang wants to serve Emperor Han so he resurrects the mummy and they head for ShangriLa. The guardian of Han's tomb and Zi's daughter Lin tells them that the only ways to destroy Han are to prevent him from reaching ShangriLa or by stabbing his heart with a cursed dagger.";

Now we have The Mummy Tomb of the Dragon Emperor I loved The Mummy The Mummy Returns it was watchable but this one was just an excuse to make some quick cash. I was actually looking forward to seeing this movie I got the opportunity to see it today I was excited but unfortunately we now have Chinese mummies that can do anything that will fit into the CGI budget. Another disappointment was the recasting of Evelyn I know Rachel Weisz turned this script down but she was seriously needed Maria Bella who is a decent actress actually made Evie a very flat character and not as enjoyable. Then not only that but we have Brendan and Maria who do look incredibly good for their age they have a 20 year old son in the movie? This story was a waste of time and money.The Emperor of China wanted to rule the entire world but when a Chinese witch curses him and his army he is put to sleep for thousands of years. Rick and Evie are now retired and have lost the spark in their relationship but when they are asked to go to Shanghai to deliver a small little ball they bump into their son who has discovered the Emperor. Rick and Evie are forced to wake the mummy by his followers. Now the whole family with Jonathan and the protector who was supposed to keep the emperor from rising must destroy the Emperor or he will take over the entire world.The Mummy Tomb of the Dragon Emperor has some OK moments I loved the beginning story and the ending battle scene is held pretty strong it's worth the look for that but I would say this is more of a rental. It's just a sad disappointment considering how much better it could have been. The one liners were too cheesy and we have three headed dragons karate kicking abdominal snow men why not just go all the way and have leprechauns with machine guns? That's how out of control the CGI effects are. Luke Ford makes Brandon Fraiser look like Marlon Brando with his acting and the love story between him and the protector girl was useless. Like I said wait for the rental not the worst movie of this year but a huge let down for sure.510".

	schema:reviewBody "I really like the Mummy series for its epic action sense of humor and great special effects. I was very excited when I started seeing teasers for this sequel to be shown in July mostly because it was quite unexpected.This movie has all the required elements of epic action sense of humor and great special effects. Of course there is still the swashbuckling hero Rick O'Connell played in grand style by Brendan Fraser. He undoubtedly has this actioncomedy genre sewn up right in his alley. John Hannah is still around playing his brotherinlaw Jonathan in his old annoying manner.For the new stuff the setting shift to China as the titular Mummy now refers to an ancient Chinese emperor who desired immortality played by Jet Li who really personified his antihero role with relish here. The emperor sought the help of a witch played with much bravado by Michelle Yeoh with whom he gets attracted to. However the witch fell in love with his main general played by Russell Wong whom you'd wonder why he isn't getting more breaks in Hollywood. From hence starts the conflict and the resultant curse on which the movie stands.The requisite martial arts you would expect in a movie set in China are of course in full play. Very well choreographed especially that thrilling sword fight between Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh. The exciting action sequences inside the boobytrapped lost tomb the truck and chariot ! chase in the streets of Shanghai and the final fight sequence with the Mummy are all executed very well as in the two previous installments.But then there are the drawbacks that for me pulls this one down to a five star rating. The quality of the spoken Mandarin is at times unintelligible. However the major beef involves what for me are severely miscast actors.The actor who plays the now collegeaged son of the O'Connells Alex looks too mature to be the son of Brendan Fraser. I just checked to see that the actor Luke Ford was born in 1981 but he looked older than that so it was a bit of a stretch to believe that he is Brendan's son. Furthermore he also does not act like a son but more like Brendan's younger brother.But the worst and damaging mistake was the decision to cast Maria Bello in the beloved role of Evelyn O'Connell which is wholly owned by the more beautiful and credible Rachel Weisz. I felt absolutely NO chemistry between Maria and Brendan. Her acting was also quite wretched when compared to Ms. Weisz who was able to maintain her intellectuality demureness and gentility on top of her topnotch fighting skills. Ms. Bello fails miserably in this regard to recapture the unique character of Evie we have loved before in my opinion.".

Its the same story as the previous ones and most of the stuff in the movie were taken from them as well. I love Brendan Fraser but he didn't look happy to be there and with how the story was set up you can't blame him for looking miserable. He has no chemistry with Maria Bello who was just awful She's no Rachel Weisz that's for damn sure. and he has even less chemistry with his own son played by Luke Ford who has the charisma and the charm of a brick not to mention the fact that he looks just as old as both Fraser and Bello. Fraser has more chemistry with John Hannah who is a welcome distraction from the lousiness of the film. The movie itself is just a flat headed mess of bad visual effects with no soul. Jet Li lacks the menacing presence of Arnold Vosloo from the previous films but that problem is more than less on the shoulders of the director who was in my opinion more concern with the style of the film than any substance it could have had and because of that Jet Li and most of the cast got the short end of the stick and it shows.They should have ended it with the second film but instead we have a movie that manages to make even The Scorpion King look as good as Iron Man.".

	schema:headline " Terrible...";
	schema:reviewBody "A true honest review? Some true honest advice? Don't waste your time on this its terrible. I am a true fan of the original. I like the way it was weaved together with interesting characters hammy dialogue and breath taking action sequences not to mention a beautiful location and some great plot devices. Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weiz lit up the screen with his charisma and her likability factor. They made a good screen presence and carried the story along until its fantastic action packed finale. I also like the way the producers mixed up the scenes to spoon out not only violent and eerie scenes involving the main villain himself but to water it down to family standards with John Hannah's comical brother. It was a film of epic proportions. A fun story likable characters and good use of live action and cgi for the most part. Then about 2 years later Universal ran out of idea's and so decided to return to the bandwagon to churn out another cash cow sequel. 'The Mummy Returns' was released and whilst not as good as the original at least had the decency to be spectacular enough for the risibility. Fraser and Weiz returned having made an offspring and warbled walloped and crashed through the bustling busy streets in a less than original screenplay but at least maintained their charm and kept the spark glowing from the first film. It was a likable sequel and whilst no where near as good as its ancestor still managed to be entertaining.So here we are folks. 2008 and yet again we are revisiting a tired series. The next gruesome threesome to bring home to Hollywood is not only the worst of the Mummy films but quite possibly the worst sequel of the year to date. Its so bad in fact that even Rachel Weiz turned it down but its not surprising having listened to some of the laughably dire dialogue churned out here. I bet she took one look at the script and threw it in the trash can. The story goes something like this... Brendan Fraser back as Rick O'Connell his wife Maria Bello yes they replaced her with someone with half as much talent her brother John Hannah what is he doing in this?and their son Luke Ford who has now aged by about 20 years are somehow prancing around in their ordinary lives in the Far East? but suddenly the son awakens an evil Mummy Emperor because hey thats what your bound to do in a movie like this who wants to use his army of the undead to take over the world and get revenge on the sorceress who put him to sleep so many years ago. The only people who can stop him are the O'Connels who crash and bang through armies of stone beasts supernatural winds and all sorts of other unoriginal menaces. Of course the showdown at the end will result in global domination or ultimate Savior. But by that time you just wont care.So.. why do I hate this one? when when one of the main stars from the original backs down and bails out and when the other looks bored throughout the whole darn thing you know you have a problem on your hands. And its sad because Brendan Fraser makes it blatantly obvious how unhappy he is reprising the role without Weiz by his side. He is never able to connect with Bello who tries to be chirpy but comes off looking rather ridiculous as the smart girl. And there we have another problem. Bello just cannot squeeze into Weiz's cleverly filled shoes. Its embarrassing to watch her warble on and you can really tell she felt uncomfortable trying to live up to the characters standards. The same can be said for Luke Ford who makes a very unconvincing action herosidekick next to Fraser. Again they have no spark or connection what so ever. It feels like a cheap decision casting Ford because he never really brings any emotion good or bad to the screen. The exception here is Jet Li who whilst is not as menacing as Arnold Vosloo the original mummy still pulls off a good dark role. Its fresh seeing him portraying an evil character and it pays off when he is actually on screen. However his presence is short lived and at times feels like a guest appearance. And of course John Hannah who never disappoints and steals the show altogether with his one liners and witty charm. He almost makes this passable. Almost.The movie deserves another good kick in this time for its overly used CGI action sequences which feel cheap tacky and unoriginal. Imagine a Roger Corman flick added into a Uwe Boll video game adaptation and your halfway there. The sets are nice to look at but the CGI is really distracting and you can tell they did things all by computers. The character development is replaced with an endless array of pointless battle sequences. Pointless !Its also really degrading seeing our much loved characters from the first movies spout lines of almost ridicule. Brendan Fraser cringes as he reads his lines is he auditioning for the high school play?and like I said Bello looks uncomfortable. Even Hannah looks bored and whilst trying to rescue this epic failure always looks like he wants to be doing better things. Like the ironing for example.There is just so much to bash this movie about. Its an obvious cash in but even fails at being entertaining. It doesn't live up to the first or even the second. It is boring confusing and the characters are bland. The action is over the top and don't get me started on the screenplay. Its just an all round failure and should be buried in the Tomb of the title never to be reawakened.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is probably one of the worst films I've seen in my life and I don't tend to toss around accusations like that lightly but this third installment of The Mummy series initiated back in 1999 deserves such dishonor cause it's such a bad example of film making it borders on offensive.I'm a guy with simple tastes I'm not one of those people who think cinema begins and ends with Bergman and Goddard I actually enjoyed the previous Mummy pictures even the second one which I know was cheesy as hell but like film critic Michael Phillips said about cheesy movies a movie sometimes is just 10.000 pounds of cheese on a cracker but sometimes I'm exactly in the mood for 10.000 pounds of cheese on a cracker. But The Mummy Tomb of Dragon Emperor is at best feces on a cracker the cracker being the amazing trailer of Quantum of Solace before the movie probably the highlight of the experience.I won't go into any details regarding the plot cause well the plot is pretty much explained fully on the trailer. We pick up with the O'Connell's retired and bored as well just as I was while watching the movie. They get at again to stop the evil Mummy of the Emperor Han from taking over the world...how original when will these Mummies just wanna lay back and enjoy the comforts of the modern age. I'd love to see a movie about an ancient Mummy  brought back from the dead only to be flabbergasted by the technology of the present and lay around drinking beer watching TV and getting fat with McDonald's. That would be more fun that all that this movie had to offer.All of the actors were there for their paychecks Brendan Fraser has never been more boring. John Hannah was also incredibly stupid and the jokes they wrote for him were not funny at all some are even distasteful. Luke Ford playing Rick's son not only looks like two minutes younger than him but less charm than R2D2 Michelle Yeoh is wasted Jet Li doesn't have the Mummy gravitas that Arnold Voosloo had and finally Maria Bello filling in for Rachel Weisz who had the good common sense to stay away from this dregs she is horrible she looks so concern with her fake Posh accent which she got wrong anyhow so at the end we are left with nothing in the acting department.Rob Cohen man is he getting worse and worse when you though Stealth was really the lowest a director could get he managed to enlighten us with an even lower level of mediocre work. He has never been an interesting director and his campy style has butchered many movies that looked interesting if only for entertaining purposes like Dragonheart and Daylight but you would expect at least with all that money spend on these summer movies to have something to show for. But no no no everything looks poor the action sequences are dull as hell. To prove my point this will probably be the only movie where a sword fight with Michelle Yeoh and Jet Li lasts about 20 seconds and it's all in slow motion. If a director cannot make a sword fight between those two modern icons of martial arts films he should really think about retiring for good.The story is stock which is to be expected from a B movie of this sort but like Raiders of the Lost Ark proved even B movies can be Oscar Hopefuls but there was no attempt at all with this one. The pacing of the story is terrible the special effects are sub par and at the end you are left with a 2 hour yawn fest to which you would fall to sleep within minutes if it weren't for the loud noises coming from the speakers.The movie is shameful and not worth the price of the ticket this movie is the reason why some theaters have money back policies and had the theater I saw this had one I would have asked not only for my money back but for a year of free admissions for having seen this awful mess.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was able to see this film about a month ago in a preview screening and to put it in kind words its terrible. Jet Li is about the only good thing about the film but he's hardly in it. Brendan Fraser was phoning in his performance and looked if he was waiting from a call from his agent to get him out of the movie. Maria Bello looked goofy and miscast and the actor who plays their son makes Hayden Christensen from the Star Wars films look like an Oscar winner. John Hannah manages to bring some laughs to the table but his stick is not as fresh as it was before and Michelle Yeoh does not really do much with her role. This movie lacks the creepiness of the first two Mummy movies and the stone warriors of this movie don't hold a candle to the ghouls of the first two films at all. Not to mention the fact that the visual effects in this film look even worse than the second filmThe Mummy Returns. The film itself seemed toned down in the fun and thrills department and just feels tired in certain scenes not to mention the dialogue which seems like it was written by a five year old. This film seemed like a quick payday from all involved and sadly with the little effort spent in giving the audience something to root for and care for its just feels like no one even cared about what they were making.".

	schema:headline " What a DOG!!!";
	schema:reviewBody "I want to say up front that I loved the first two Mummy movies so I am not a hater of this franchise. They were campy very tongueincheek and there was this wonderful rapport between the actors which came out in their performances. I went into this one with some trepidation because much of the main cast of the first two films would not be in it Rachel Weisz Arnold Vosloo Patricia Velasquez and Oded Fehr but I figured well the first two were great or at least a lot of fun so how bad could this one be?Oh. My. God.!!! I am not exaggerating when I say that the best part of the movie was the Chinesewriting animation of the closing credits. Five minutes into the film I was cringingly embarrassed for the actors and it only got worse. The only actor whose performance didn't suck a dead dog's butt was Jet Li but only just  he basically spent the whole movie yelling killing people and looking extremely cheesed off. There was no connection between his character and the audience. I mean Imhotep in the first two films did evil things but he had this romantic tragedy thing going on because he was in love with Anck Su Namun and you could see some reason for his actions and you could even maybe sympathize with him a little bit particularly at the end of The Mummy Returns when he realized that Anck Su Namun didn't really love him  at least not like Evie loved Rick  and it had all been for nothing. He had a human quality I guess. The Dragon Emperor not so much. As far as anyone could tell he was just a megalomaniacal twit with a worlddomination complex  there were no redeeming features in his character  it was just a cardboard cutout of evil. The only thing I have to say about the motherdaughter immortal protectors team is that even put together they're no Ardeth Bay. Maria Bello was horribly miscast as Evie O'Connell. Her performance seemed clingy and desperate not just Evie being clingy and desperate but herself Maria the actress. Luke Ford was a huge waste of space  I never thought I'd see an actor who was worse at acting than Keanu Reeves but Keanu Reeves is a great Shakespearean compared to Luke Ford. I echo another reviewer's comment in saying why didn't they just keep Freddie Boath? He's about the right age and he was actually funny in The Mummy Returns. Of course it's probably better for his career that he didn't appear in this piece of trash ditto Rachel Weisz et al.  kudos to their agents for keeping them out of it. Brendan Fraser whose performances I really enjoyed in the first two movies although a great actor he is not seemed like he was tired of the whole thing  monumentally bored and just milking the franchise for another paycheck I know that's a horrible thing to say but I can't imagine why else the egregious performance  I mean you can only blame so much of it on the rotten script. John Hannah another actor whom I usually really like ditto. To paraphrase Mark Twain from Fenimore Cooper's Literary Offenses the filmmaker should make the viewer feel a deep interest in the people in the film and in their fate he should make the viewer love the good people and hate the bad ones. But the viewer of The Mummy Tomb of the Dragon Emperor dislikes the good people in it is indifferent to the others and wishes they would all get drowned together.There was nothing even remotely funny about this movie  the jokes if you want to call them that were either tired stupid or completely flat. The special effects couldn't make up for the mondo suckiness of this piece of... uh... film. Even if they had been of the thrilling sort that one expects. Which these were not. The Yetis could have been cool but they just um weren't. And the whole field goal thing was so NOT!I had to give this film a rating of 1 awful because that's as low as IMDb's scale goes but I'd really like to give it something more like a 27. And I'd also really like a refund on the two hours of my life I wasted watching this dog. Boo! Hiss!! Yuck!!!".

They were campy very tongueincheek and there was this wonderful rapport between the actors which came out in their performances. I went into this one with some trepidation because much of the main cast of the first two films would not be in it Rachel Weisz Arnold Vosloo Patricia Velasquez and Oded Fehr but I figured well the first two were great or at least a lot of fun so how bad could this one be?Oh.

	schema:reviewBody "Since we saw Mummy III and Hellboy II as a drivein double bill we're doing sort of a twofer  reviewing both movies simultaneously and posting under both titles  because we discovered that we were actually watching the same movie twice. It was a fascinating way to see these films giving us the opportunity to directly compare and contrast them and analyze why one succeeded and the other failed.Synopsis Ancient Relic must be returned to Undead Villain so that Villain might be reanimated in order to summon his Demon Army and destroy the World. Hero's task is to thwart this process. In the course of attempting to prevent Armageddon Hero is nearly killed but is saved at the last minute by Love. Hero's power is not great enough to stop Villain so secondary characters must make the Ultimate Sacrifice in order to dispatch Villain and Save the World. The End. If it all sounds familiar it's because it's also the plot of nearly every superhero or fantasy movie made over the last umpteen years. Note to Hollywood It's time to come up with a new plot line OK? Please? We were expecting to enjoy Mummy III. First there was Brendan Fraser and most of the cast of the previous Mummy films. Then there was the rich potential of the setting  the Terra Cotta Warriors the mystery and lore of China...even a trip to ShangriLa and Yetis. The table was set for a feast of mystery wonder and enchantment. How could they not produce an entertaining film out of all this? One word Writing. We're always amazed when megabuck films apparently cap the writing budget at a buck ninetyseven. Early on didn't anyone involved in this say Hey the script we're working from really stinks!? The rich mythology available to them was utterly wasted by the writers. ShangriLa was a cheesy set that served only as a platform for one of the progressive plot elements. The Yeti though well done performed their little shtick and left the scene. One appearance by the shapeshifting villain as a threeheaded dragon and so much for the fascinating potential of Chinese dragon lore. The hero's skeletal army could have offered another little tribute to Ray Harryhausen as was done so well in the first Mummy but no why bother? And the dialogue was uniformly clumsy blunt and contributed nothing to either character development or plot movement.The writers in Mummy III were obviously in video game mode. Video games need progressive plot tasks. So the Relic is returned to the Villain. But wait  now the Villain must carry a jewel to the mountains that will reveal the location of ShangriLa. But wait  now the Villain must enter the waters of ShangriLa to be fully restored. But wait  now the Villain must return to his tomb and summon his Terra Cotta Army. But wait  now the Army must make it over the Great Wall in order to achieve immortality. And so it goes. Played out like the levels of a video game and with even less explanation of the rationale than you'd get in a video game. These are game levels rather than story elements and since the audience's need to be informed isn't fulfilled it winds up not understanding  and consequently not caring about  what's going on.In Hellboy II directorwriter del Toro had the more difficult task. Without a wealth of Chinese mythology to squander he had to invent his own...but he does it so very well to see what we mean watch Pan's Labyrinth  please!. Del Toro is an imaginative story teller and myth maker and proves it in Hellboy II. He also appreciates something the writers of Mummy III don't  the wonder of small magic. The single moment in Mummy III that made my wife Ooooh! was the transformation of the eggthing that awakened the emperor. Beautifully done  but the only thing of its kind in the movie. Everything else was bigger than life overblown. In contrast del Toro is full of small magic. From tooth fairies to troll markets to wheels within wheels he understands that an audience can be just as enchanted by the small wonder as by the huge spectacle. It's the difference between stage and closeup magic. Make an airliner disappear and I will only wonder about the mechanics of how you did it. Make a coin float in midair before my eyes and I will be mystified.A hallmark of both the Mummy and the Hellboy franchises is the effective use of humor. Mummy fell flat at every attempt. thanks to inept writing. Hellboy pulled it off very well  two love stricken clueless guys getting plastered to Barry Manilow's Can't Smile Without You was delightful. We also have to mention del Toro's mastery of lighting set design and mood. His movies are consistently visually evocative which makes a good movie even better.The movies shared one flaw with several other recent movies climactic action scenes that go into visual and auditory overload causing the eyes to glaze over and reducing the ability to comprehend what's going on. When we lose the ability to take in what you're showing us this is a bad thing. Please don't toss everything at us at once just because you can  let us absorb your work so we can fully appreciate it. Had the intense action not drenched us a few times in Hellboy II it would have another star.In summary both movies had capable casts and premises with wonderful potential. Mummy III failed sadly to capitalize while Hellboy II succeeded very well. The difference was the quality of the writing and the talent of the directing. We only wish the Mummy III crew could take a mulligan sit down and take a few lessons from del Toro and try again. It's a shame that can't happen.".

	schema:reviewBody "I almost didn't see this in the theater due to all the bad reviews. What changed my mind was Roger Ebert giving it a rare positive review. Since I agree with Ebert more than most critics I decided to go see it.I have to say that none of the reviews or comments I've read tell the whole picture IMHO. Neither Ebert's praise nor other critics' pans are entirely appropriate. Lets' start with the basics... The Mummy was a modern retelling of a 30's B monster movie with up to date FX. It wasn't great drama but it was a rousing thrill ride that capably did its job of entertaining you if you weren't too picky about plot etc. The two sequels have continued this tradition. I'd rate this as inferior to the original but slightly superior to The Mummy Returns.Much has been made about the casting of Maria Bello in the role originated by Rachel Weisz. While I'm not a Rachel Weisz fanboy she is a very capable actress and I just don't believe Ms. Bello was up to the role. There is simply no chemistry between Bello and Brendan Fraser. There are basically only two legitimate reasons to make a sequel 1 either there are loose ends to tie up or 2 people really like the characters and want to see more of them. Each film in the Mummy franchise ties up its own loose ends so the producers are risking commercial suicide to change the characters in any significant way. If they couldn't get Rachel Weisz they should have been much more careful in recasting the role. There's very little physical resemblance between the two actresses and Ms. Bello simply doesn't seem to have the acting chops to carry it off. That unfortunate casting choice casts a pall over the whole enterprise  but not enough to sink it.Some have criticized the film because they don't believe that Brendan Fraser looks old enough to have a son Luke Ford's age. That's arguable all of the holdover cast is starting to show their age  especially John Hannah but again it's not a dealbreaker.OTOH the secondary roles are excellent. Michelle Yeoh and Isabella Leong are excellent while Jet Li gives another great performance as the evil emperor. Luke Ford is somewhat bland though and doesn't appear to be a good candidate to carry the franchise into the future.The CGI FX are generally excellent but nothing we haven't seen in the first two films. The exception to this are the yetis! With only a few minutes of screen time they pretty much steal every scene they're in. Where the FX do seem lacking is in imagination scale and scope when compared to the previous two films. Perhaps that's because more of the action in the previous films took place in dark claustrophobic settings while here many of them are in brightly lit sunlight. The battle scenes in particular suffer in the inevitable comparison to the Lord of the Rings trilogy.Was this film made principally to milk the franchise? Almost certainly but then so was The Mummy Returns. But that doesn't mean it fails on its own terms. It is entertaining and supplies much of the same appeal as its predecessors. If you can watch it on those terms and if Maria Bello's casting isn't too disappointing to you then go see it  you may have a good time. I did.".

Only Jet Li is respectable in this acting shambles!The brief highlights to 'The Mummy Tomb of the Dragon Emperor' are in its expensive budget. This means the movie entails some exhilarating scenes in short spurts particularly the O'Connell's pursuit of the Emperor.

	schema:reviewBody "I have decided that I need to start adding my comments on IMDb which I had rarely done before just to offset all the comments from other people that I tend not to agree with. Sure when I see a solid 7 or 8 on IMDb the movie seems to warrant that type of score but lately I've been seeing a lot of movies that are not bad that are getting unfairly hammered on their scores. On average I probably watch over 300 movies a year  now that doesn't give me a Masters degree in film or whatnot but to be able to have an opinion about an art form it doesn't take a degree. So to all of you scanning IMDb comments like I do consider pausing with this one cause I'm gonna try to give you my view straight up. Enough of that. The key to all movies is expectations. Going into the theater or before renting the movie  what were you expecting? Before you go and see a mummy movie that is an actionadventure I do not think expecting a lot of great acting and academyaward winning chemistry is reasonable. I do however expect decentgood acting if you get great actingchemistry  that's icing on top. Like others commented  at a high level this movie follows the formula of the previous ones. That's not a bad thing since I cannot imagine a new and amazing mummy story featuring an Indiana Jones wannabe couple. I also think some of the casting might not have been the best but I did not see any blaring failures. John Hannah was a refreshing character this go around whereas I think he might have been a little too much of a winner in the past. I also do not think Maria Bello did a bad job at all  I tend to think that when a major character is covered by a new actor or actress you should not expect the same result. Thus the question to me isn't whether or not she was as good as Rachel Weisz or whether she would have done a better job the question is whether or not Maria added or detracted from the character in the story. I found her to be attractive pleasant and physically capable for the role. She seemed to meet the threshold for me. Now the weakest link was Luke Ford  with the worst chemistry with the other characters  so there you could argue he did not meet the threshold of good enough for me poor casting in my opinion in terms of both his acting and age. In sharp contrast to other reviewers I found the humor in the movie to be good  though perhaps not as often or funny as I would have liked. Pace of the movie was great  either the action or the environment of the movie kept me interested. Some of the sets were very detailed although not historically accurate. The action and the CGI was excellent  the choreography and editing was done very well. I truly despise the tendency of modern action to either focus too close to the action cut too often or overuse camera angles  this movie did none of those anybody who complains of the use of wires in this movie needs to stop watching actionfantasy movies that involve thousands of undead  that's like complaining about the use of stunt people. If you are looking for another actionadventure movie cause you've seen a ton of them like me or you like the Mummy movie series enough to want to see another you probably won't be disappointed. If you're looking for amazing acting with actionsuspenseadult themes go watch Lantana The Blackbook or 300. Solid 7.5 7 is a solid goodenoughtowatch for me. Gets the 0.5 for the fact that I like the Asian theme without being over the top i.e. racist and I like the Mummy series Michelle Yeoh Jet Li and Brendan Fraser.".

I wish I could say the same about the acting. Story has not changed much from the previous movies. Mummy rises Mummy wants to rule world must stop Mummy. The new wife of Brendan Fraser is not as good of an actress or as hot as the previous actress. Brendan Fraser's son was not that great of an actor either. And i was confused with how old Fraser's son was supposed to be. It looked like his son aged 22 years but Fraser only aged 2 years from the last movie strange.Overall the movie was okay.

Action shots are too close in so you can't see enough of what is going on. For instance the sole fight scene between Michelle Yeoh and Jet Li is too close in. You can't see what these two martial arts experts are capable of. All you see is an occasional whirl of their arms a twist of their torsos and maybe a scowl if you're lucky. Legs and kicks don't come through because it's shot from the waist up too close in. It lasts like 2 minutes  a real disappointment given what these two can really do. The plot has all this contrived cutesy gook and sometimes it contradicts itself. This is a HUGE disappointment  a waste of money. No wonder Weisz saw fit not to sign up. Bring her and Stephen Sommers back and it would have been the same great Mummy movies from before.".

It brings back the feel of the other Mummies so you get what you paid for. However don't expect the same. Expect a little less. The actors writers clearly expected the charm and past of the characters to carry over thinking that we've already been won over. Thus they don't really even try.Whelp it's okay. There you have it.

But very rarely for me I was wrong on two counts. This film had all the action and all the laughs of its predecessors yet it certainly had the strongest plot out of all of the trilogy. On this occasion I was glad to be wrong. However the casting was where it all fell apart hence why this film has earned 7 brownie points from me rather than the 9 it would have otherwise deserved. Firstly Maria Bello was quite possibly the worst choice for Evelyn that could possibly have been made. I noticed more chemistry between Jonathon and that yak than between Rick and Evelyn in this movie. Secondly Luke Ford while a decent actor bore no family resemblance to either Brendan or Maria. By the way did anybody else remember that in the second movie his hair was blond? Quite a large slip up there. There were five saving graces in the cast however Brendan Fraser once again pulled off Rick O'Connell Jet Li was equally as evil as his predecessor Michelle Yeoh was astounding as Zi Yuan and John Hannah provided plenty of comic relief with his lovably irritating Jonathan. Finally the Yetis! These were an unexpected addition that surprisingly worked quite well.To finish go and see this movie if you want a film that gives some cheap thrills without pretending to be anything else.".

And also I absolutely love Brenden Fraiser and I was excited to see him back for another mummy movie! He was really funny in this movie and I actually got quite a few laughs!

Before watching The Mummy 3 I thought it looked bigger and better than the previous two. After walking out of the theater I completely change my opinion. I was disappointed with the story acting and action. Yes the action.Rick O'Connell Bredan Fraser is back to fight off a resurrected mummy named Emperor Han Jet Li. Rick is joined by his son Alex Luke Ford wife Evelyn Maria Bello and Jonathan John Hannah. They travel all the way to China and the frigid Himalayas in order to stop the mummy from conquering the world. But in order to complete his mission Emperor Han awakes a massive 10000 warriors Terracota army to finished the job once and for all. The O'Connells are up against an unstoppable army and an evil Emperor that will do anything to get the job done.The story was very interesting but the script was not. I thought they should had focus more on the mummy than Alex's life. I felt like Jet Li didn't have enough screen time or even just the mummy. Another thing that I felt a bit disappointed was the beginning of the movie. I liked how they were introducing Emperor Han and how everything started but it felt like a documentary after a while.I had mix reactions about the performance in the movie. I didn't have any problem with Fraser's performance. He fits his character and he was great in The Mummy and The Mummy Returns. Maria Bello was not as good as I thought she would be. She did okay but the accent was kind of weird at times though.The action and special effects was probably the best thing in the movie. The action sequences were very good but I thought they could have been better though. I wanted to see longer battles. Like a longer version of Jet Li fighting Michelle Yeoh and Brendan Fraser at the end of the movie. I thought Jet Li should off had a big fight with Fraser. It was suppose to be an epic oneonone fight but it fell short. The special effects were good and believable. I didn't have no major problem with the effects what so ever.The Mummy 3 was a fun movie to watch but the film has it's flaws. If the the script was better then I would have given the movie higher rating. While I'm not that interested for the next movie I am curious to see how it turns out.".

The story is also quite simple but anyone including men can relate to it for it deals with the most common human emotions love loneliness friendship sorrow and happiness and what's truly inspiring is the simple and humorous way these emotions have been conveyed.

Nathalie Baye was superb as the lonely Angle and the entire supporting cast is excellent the socialite and oppressive Madame Nadine Bulle Ogier the sweet and naive Marie Audrey Tautou the troubled Samanthe Mathilde Seigner and the breathtaking Madame Buisse Claire Nadeau.

She thinks it only brings pain and that love is a form of slavery.  She's a very attractive woman but looks sad all the time and her friends notice.Audrey Tautou plays Marie another worker at the salon and she's a plain country girl who starts having an affair with a much older man.  Mathilde Seigner plays Samantha who is tough on the outside and has lots of boyfriends but is hurting inside she tries to kill herself on Christmas Eve.But Angle is the focus of this film.  We see her sitting with a man in a train station cafe at the beginning of the film confident that he's enamored with her but he brushes her aside saying it was just an affair and walks away.  Then Madame Nadine the beauty shop owner tells her she needs to fix her appearance and apply more makeup which only adds to her depression. Along comes Antoine a much younger man who saw the spat at the train station and who follows Angle back to where she works.  He approaches her and professes his love for her really his obsession for her.  Angle isn't interested in a relationship and Antoine isn't interested in casual sex so things don't look good for the pair.  But as the story progresses she opens up to him and by the end they're both in love with each other.I would have liked the film more than I did if the character of Antoine had been different.   He's got a good physique and is much younger than Angle so I can see why she'd be attracted to him and she's a goodlooking woman so I can see him being attracted to her but as two people I didn't really see the chemistry between them.  Antoine seemed a bit too immature to make this romance seem true.  But he is open and tender and Angle is vulnerable and needs some extra care so maybe that's the key.Anyway the characters were all interesting and the acting welldone.  There was a tender poignancy in the relationships between the people in the beauty shop and their customers as well as some pretty funny scenes and the film explores some adult themes about the nature of love and relationships so I would definitely recommend this one even if it might have been better.".

Well she is careless with men. She is perhaps too easy. She picks up men the wrong ones. She is aggressive in her desire. And now she has become cynical. All she wants now are onenights stands no more love no more unbreak my heart. Love is too painful.So when Antoine falls in love with her at something like first sight I do have a weakness for love at first sight it is so so daring and so shall we say unpredictable she rejects him out of hand even though he is a vital and handsome artist confident and winning. What IS her problem? But he pursues her even though he is engaged to another Hlne Fillires. And when she gets drunk and wants some casual sex with him he says no. He wants her fully in control of her faculties.So this is a romantic comedy of sorts centered around a beauty parlor. However any resemblance to Hollywood movies in the same genre Shampoo 1975 and Hairspray 1988 somehow come to mind is purely coincidental. Here the salon is brightly and colorfully lit with a tinker bell as the door opens and the clientele are eclectic to say the least an exhibitionist who arrives in a raincoat and nothing else a rich old man lusting after Tautou a woman with oozing pimples on her...never mind...etc.What makes this work so well is a completely winning performance by Baye sharp direction by Toni Marshall and a kind of quirky and blunt realism that eschews all clich. Tautou fans will be disappointed in her modest part but she is just adorable in that role. The voyeur scene in which she is willingly seduced by the rich old guy may raise your libido or your envy depending on where you're coming from. Ha!See this for Nathalie Baye who gives the performance of a lifetime simultaneously subtle and strong vulnerable and willful. She makes us identify with her character and she makes us wish her love.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

	schema:headline " Good Bittersweet Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie has some fine acting.  It is driven by character rather than plot.  Nathalie Baye as Angle plays a 40ish beautician in Paris.  She has had a traumatic childhood and has been burned in love so she limits herself to onenight stands where she is in the driver's seat.  Then a man obsessively falls for her and she has to decide whether to open up to love or at least the possibility of it.

She has had a traumatic childhood and has been burned in love so she limits herself to onenight stands where she is in the driver's seat.  Then a man obsessively falls for her and she has to decide whether to open up to love or at least the possibility of it.

	schema:reviewBody "I disagree with the critics who find this film to be mostly about the menagerie of pitiful youthcrazed females who come to the Venus salon for magical potions to hold on to their youth.  Take that of course for comic relief but there is much more to this film.I think there IS a real love story here.  Middleaged love love the umteenth time around.  It's not so easy.  This film looks at a woman and I guess it looks at the woman's point of view as well.  She is in control. She chooses the time and the place.  Only it isn't love.  It is flings as the translator calls it.  We call it casual sex.Angele works as a beautician because she likes to help people.  Or maybe she does because she disfigured an important lover in the past and is still making amends.  She doesn't want to move up to management despite her age 40 and climbing despite advice to do so by the mangeress of the house.She just wants to be one of the girls.  That's this persona she clings to and she's better at it than the twentysomethings that surround her. Only they are happy mostly and she is not.  Her control gives her safety but not very much passion.  She has the sacrificed the head over heels kind of loving that is so energizing and youngmaking.We join Angele's life at that moment of change when someone comes along and gives her back what she has been dishing out.  A man arbitrarily approaches her quasistalks her and says out of the blue I love you!Now this is just the thing that one of her girlfriends fantasizes about a zipless love out of left field that leads to perpetual union happily ever after.  But Angele is dumbfounded.  She's put off balance.  And in effect this is where the love story begin and where the film starts to pay off.Although we learn later that her suitor Antoine has a nice body he does not present to her the dark ruthless knowing threehour bang that she's used to.  This makes it easier to blow him off to comprehend him as a younger man with an obsession  her words  rather than an answer to her unasked question.That's something else I liked about the film.  Besides depicting the hard life of people deciding whether to take yet another risk on love in middle age the film both by words and silences points up how many questions are not asked.  People have their lifecoping strategies and they are so full of flaws.  The writers and director keep you ahead of the game so you usually see what questions should be on the table.Arriving at the setup point of this film we see that Angele's question should be just how much longer can I nourish myself with onenight stands before I get in trouble or my partner pool deteriorates or I have to start giving little gifts or the inhumanity of it all makes me drink too much etc.But soon after other questions percolate to the top.  Have I already gone past the point of no return?  Can I love again?  Can I respond to an impetuous man like I could as a child?  Like my girlish peer beauticians still can?Or is that even a fair demand to put on myself?  Shouldn't HE find a way to reach ME that is unique to me Angele as who and where I am in my life? Shouldn't HE make more of an effort than just to apply his cardboard templates from HIS last romance to me?Selectively the film acts out these questions with efficient little skits and interchanges.  The positive and cumulative results of these bits and pieces signaled to me that this film was driving towards a good outcome as opposed to a romantic tragedy of roads not taken or plans not met.'You should fck more and plan less says one of Angele's more disagreeable men.  Will that be her fate that she can no longer command the resources and lucky breaks to climb out of the pit she has dug for herself?I doubt when you are 20 years old you can every imagine how life's options can become so narrow by the time 20 more years go by.Therefore I am prepared to believe that the hard edge will seem unreasonable to younger viewers but perhaps more responsible to other older viewersAlthough this was not their primary purpose the dating by the manageress Madam Nadine and the awkward flirtation between the Aviator and Marie could be used to show that dating gets even harder as further years pass bye.To wrap this up I found the pushing and shoving of uncertain love the tenuousness the false starts the failure and restarts in this one French film to be more convincing than all the love treatments in Vanilla Sky Monster's Ball Crush 2001 Shallow Hall Proof of Life combined.I rating this an EIGHT 8 reminding me that French films still have a lot to teach me at least about love after all these years.".

Angle meets Antoine Samuel Le Bihan a sculptor who has a crush with her but the bitter and heartbroken Angle has problems to believe on his love. I liked this romance about a heartbroken middle age woman finding love again. First because of the great performance of the beautiful Nathalie Baye who was fiftyone years old in 1999. The gorgeous Audrey 'Amlie Poulain' Tautou and Mathilde Seigner are collyrium for the eyes of the male viewers being another attraction. The story has some ups and downs with some shallow situations like the exhibitionist client who walks naked in the beauty shop but the balance is very positive. The story ends like a fairy tale and is enjoyable. My vote is seven.Title Brazil 'Instituto de Beleza Venus' 'Venus Beauty Institute'".

	schema:reviewBody "Angle works in a Paris beauty salon with the ingnuelike Marie and cynical Samantha. Their boss is the supportive but businesslike Nadine an extremely funny and perceptive performance by Ogier one of Buuel's bourgeois in Le Charme Discret and the dominatrix of Schroeder's Matresse who has years of experience in broken hearts and knows how to keep a professional distance. The film charts Angle's own progress from embittered divorce to feeling human being through her pursuit by the lovesmitten sculptor Antoine.We first see Angle chatting up a total stranger in a railway buffet. This is what she does. She picks up men for casual sex because her faith in the possibility of love left her when her marriage failed actually she shot her husband though not fatally. It is ironic therefore that a strikingly similar crime of passion causes a turnaround but enough said for now.What delights most of all in this film is Nathalie Baye's performance. Having had to make do for much of her career with Adjanitype roles such as those in Le Retour de Martin Guerre or La Balance she has matured to the point where at last she is being offered more interesting work. She invests Angle with the vulnerability that we have glimpsed in the past but which carries before it a prickly resilience necessary for survival.Another great pleasure is the portrait of the beauty salon milieu which lays bare rather than covers up  human foibles with typical Gallic frankness. This is not the ersatz world of Cher in Mermaids nor does it adopt the feminist critique that beauty products are emblems of women's selfenslavement to men. Instead it allows both humour and melancholy to let individual cases speak for themselves. The salon is a selfcontained world with its naggingly distinctive door jingle where different solutions to the single woman's predicament are offered by employee and customer alike. Nadine tells Angle 'When you're not a girl any more you'd better decide not to be a girl any more.' Samantha is promiscuous but unlike Angle allows her disappointments to affect her professional life which brings her into conflict with Nadine. But significantly when she tells Nadine where to go while we may sympathise more with Samantha Nadine is not made to look petty by comparison it is possible to imagine how an American film would handle this scene very differently. Marie has a liaison with an injured pilot Sixties matine idol Robert Hossein many years her senior something Angle finds it hard to understand until she is turned on by witnessing their nocturnal tryst. Meanwhile Angle's provincial aunts Micheline Presle the director's mother and star of Boule de Suif and Le Diable au Corps and Emmanuelle Riva most famously of Resnais's Hiroshima Mon Amour  both too briefly glimpsed here coexist in a domestic routine which is comparatively idyllic but envy Angle's independence and ability to live it up in the big city. No one is happy.Clearly the sculptor with his undemanding love is the key for Angle and many another single female no doubt! but just how the film makes the transition from her morose rebuttals to melting acceptance is one aspect in which you may feel it betrays its Mike Leighstyle realism by opting for an ending which is too whimsical. We hope this does not spoil the many other qualities of Marshall's film.By the same director If you enjoy Vnus Beaut you would certainly like Tonie Marshall's earlier feature Pas trs catholique.".

Not just for the frank discussions nor for the fact that I preferred the women just talking amongst themselves coworkers together and also coworkers with clients rather than interacting with the men in their lives...Sex in the City flipped more than a few stereotypes and in Venus we find the lead character a woman who has grown weary and too jejune for je taime. She's not so much in a state of despair as one of dispassion. We see men in films like this...and watch as somehow they are wooed back to vivaciousness but not often do we see similar women.I mean I don't really think Stella ever lost her groove it was more like she knew it was under the blankets on the floor. But Nathalie Baye's fallen Angele is past searching for Mister Right she's hooking up with a series of Monsieur Wrong Nows. Light spoilers follow...I'd recommend seeing this film and I would echo what another reviewer stated this probably will be appreciated by a slightly older audience. Or more honestly by jaded types of any age!For other reviewers here and elsewhere who seem to take a tack of Why I'd never... Um even if you swear on a stack of Emily Post's books still I think if your husband cheated on you and you accidentally shot him in the face who knows...you might. And more to the point maybe you should... Mishima liked his women to have a flaw although he was more partial to a physical one to set off the pure beauty...the same axiom can be applied to personality traits. So lighten up and embrace your dark side. Just don't shoot anybody...Anyways back to this film there are also nice touches of humor throughout. A lot actually. And poignant scenes too such as when Angele talks to a girlfriend not from the salon. I really liked the open dialog between those two their blunt assessments of each other. The old dramatic element of visiting one's nemesis under disguise or false pretenses worked as it almost always does here we see it when Helene comes to the salon.As for the salon itself well people have talked about its pulsating pinkness. There may be no glass ceiling but there are certainly glass walls housing them. It makes for a nice dichotomy between women on display and the actual women inside. Only Audrey Tautou remains under glass even when she's taken out of the shop...in a very steamy or actually smoky scene. That scene is doubly voyeuristic and her small role here hits about 11 on the naif scale.Tautou is gorgeous no doubt but for those of you who spend all your time slowmotioning her striptease you are skipping over the real beauty of Venus Baye's performance here is a gem...with some defining blemishes. You could draw parallels from her Angele to Kim Catrall's Samantha I honestly preferred the former. I never thought of the Sex in the City fantastic four as remotely real I did not need to do so to enjoy them. I feel similarly about the Women from Venus. And I only had a onenighter with them whereas I saw Carrie and company off and on for years.710".

In the film she works at the Venus Beauty Salon but the film actually centers on Nathalie Baye and her rather bizarre life. Ms. Tautou is clearly a supporting actress but following the amazing success of her film Amlie unscrupulous people changed the box art to make it look like it was a starring role for her. For her part however he is probably at her most radiant and sensual.As for the film it's about period of several months in the life of Baye. Baye plays a middleaged sexually compulsive woman who loves casual sex but is deeply afraid of a deeper commitment. A strangely compulsive younger man suddenly begins stalking herannouncing that he loves her even though they had never formally met! In the midst of this very screwed up relationship you see the coworkers in their relationships though these are never explored in the same depth as Baye's.If you are looking for some depth or meaning in this film I sure couldn't find any. While some might see Baye as a work in progress and by the end of the film she's finally found happiness this isn't clearly established and based on her life so far this seemed unlikely. I certainly hope nobody sees this film and thinks Baye is a role model or even particularly likable. However it is a well done portrait of a very flawed woman and the acting is very goodjust not particularly pleasant.By the way there is quite a bit of explicit nudity in this film as one of the customers is an exhibitionist. Adults should consider this before showing the movie to kids.".

There's even an early role for Audrey Tautou which provides  one clue as to the tone of the film.

	schema:headline " Best Van Damme SciFiAction comic book classic film!";
	schema:reviewBody "Timecop 1994 is my favorite Van Damme action scifi classic! Just Like Sylvester Stallone's Judge Dredd Van Damme's Timecop is very Underrated action scifi flick ever. One of my favorite and serious Van Damme's roles in this film. Great travel time great action great villains and great story. I love the fighting sequences as well. One of my favorite action movie flicks till this days. It was directed from Peter Hyams who become a good friend with Van Damme and a year later he directed Sudden Death with Van Damme. He was the only one of the directors who come visit Van Damme in hospital after he got injured. His son years later directed two Universal Soldier film sequels. I love this movie to death and it is my 6th favorite best Van Damme movie.What I meant in the top written to take a few scifi leaps of faith This movie involves time travel about a cop who travels from 2004 to 1994 and try's to prevent the death of his wife and change the future. It does involve travel into the past so it immediately presents a timetravel paradox which can't really be resolved. Timecop 1994 is very underrated film there was a sequel and a shortlived ABC series. I watched the sequel without Van Damme in it and the sequel sucked. In here you have nice realistic martial arts and action. You have a lot of explosions and it also involves conspiracy. Ron Silver did an excellent joy playing a villain in this movie as Senator McComb. Mia Sara was absolutely wonderful as Max's Van Damme's wife Melissa.Timecop is more classic. Halfnhalf scifiaction films get lost beneath pure action and pure scifi but Timecop is top shelf. This was another childhood movie. I actually rented on a VHS tape in the 90's my parents paid me for the VHS tape so I could watch this movie. I like this movie a lot. I have it on Bluray in my Van Damme collection. I have grew up with this movie and it was a hit in 1994 when it was released out. Today I love it so much. The film is a lot smarter than people give it credit for. I also think Van Damme definitely deserves some credit for his nonaction scenes in this film but I suppose his performance in this film will always be remembered for that splits scene. The movie it self has a good look action and effects and very good acting performance by Van Damme you really feel bad for him and want to see him kick bad guys asses. Also I think that this movie has Van Damme's best hairstyle. That mullet Is the best he ever had not the one in Hard Target. And yes this movie like many other Van Damme classics deserves a special edition.Not only this movie is my favorite best Van Damme movie it is one of those movies that you watch over and over again and never gets tiring . A lot of my friends that I know in real life loves this movie. Someone said it is even the best one. Honestly this is the third time Van Damme played in a science fiction movie. The first time was in cyborg 1989 and the second time was in Universal Soldier. I never really liked Cyborg but I absolutely love this movie. The action sequences where amazing the fight scenes and Van Damme martial arts where very realistic. I always enjoy watching Timecop. I enjoy the story the concept and the action. I think this film is beginning to get a bad wrap from the general audience. like oh it is cheesy. oh its a guilty pleasure at best that's stupid! This film deserves a special edition in some way.That is the more or less basic plot In order to even try watching this movie you MUST LOOK PAST THE PARADOX. If you don't this movie has zero credibility and is not worth your time. The paradox in leap faith of this movie is also that works so well and fits with the story. JeanClaude Van Damme was great. In my opinion this was one of his best performances. I also liked the opening scene and the scene in which he goes back to 1929 to arrest his partner.".

Atwood tells that he is working for Senator McComb who is a powerful politician that is running for president. Atwood prefers to die and does not confess that McComb is a criminal. Now Max knows the truth but McComb is changing the past and Max does not know how stop him.Timecop is a highly entertaining film despite the clichs and the inconsistencies. Most of the scenes are written to explore Van Dammes skill with fights. Ron Silver performs his usual villain roleand is very effective. But better of turn your brain off and enjoy Timecop. My vote is six.Title Brazil Timecop  O Guardio do Tempo Timecop  The Guardian of Time".

Atwood tells that he is working for Senator McComb who is a powerful politician that is running for president. Atwood prefers to die and does not confess that McComb is a criminal. Now Max knows the truth but McComb is changing the past and Max does not know how stop him.Timecop is a highly entertaining film despite the clichs and the inconsistencies. Most of the scenes are written to explore Van Dammes skill with fights. Ron Silver performs his usual villain roleand is very effective. But better of turn your brain off and enjoy Timecop. My vote is six.Title Brazil Timecop  O Guardio do Tempo Timecop  The Guardian of Time";

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the best ActionSciFi films ever made in my opinion with a kick ass story and 2 amazing performances from Van Damme and Mia Sara!. All the characters are wonderful and i think this is Van Damme's 3rd best plus Van Dammeas usual and Mia Sara are simply amazing in this!. The effects were just awesome and one of the coolest scenes for me is when The future Van Damme confronts his wife it was rather tense and very moving plus Ron Silver is extremely menacing as the main villain!. I thought Van Damme's acting was fantastic and he and Mia Sara had amazing chemistry together plus the opening is quite disturbing and very memorable. It's quite original and it had a fantastic all around cast plus it's exciting throughout!. The finale is one of the best ever and i thought the ending was really neat and quite emotional plus It had some great fight scenes as well!. It's one of Van Damme's best performances and i thought it was extremely well written and made as well plus i can't believe this only has a 5.5 rating as it should be much much higher in my opinion!.It really is a brilliant film and i just loved the whole concept of time traveling! plus it's very imaginative and creative as well!. All the characters are very likable and i really hope they make a true sequel to this with both Van Damme and Mia Sara back together! plus it has quite a few shocking and disturbing scenes as well. Van Damme once again has a cool lookand i thought the scene where Van Damme visits Sarah Fielding in the hospital was really moving and tense plus the locations were also awesome!.There were also quite a few harsh jokes throwin' at Van Damme and he took them extremely well This is one of the best ActionScFi films ever made in my opinion with a kick ass story and 2 amazing performances from Van Damme and Mia Sara and if you haven't seen it do so immediately! you won't regret it's one of Van Damme's absolute best!.The Direction is amazing!.Peter Hyams does an amazing job here with wonderful camera work fantastic angles some great close up shots great use of colors and he kept the film at an extremely fast pace!.There is a little bit of blood and violence. We get some bloody gunshot wounds harsh beatings a bloody broken nosegunshot wounds to the head with blood and brains spurtingwicked shattering armgraphic fall victims cool scar transformations and other minor stuff.The Acting is amazing!. Jean Claude Van Damme is AMAZING as always and is amazing here he is extremely likable fantastic in the acting department had amazing chemistry with Mia Sara gives one of his best performances had tons of charisma had a lot of character and just did an amazing job overall!. Van Damme Rules!!!!!!!! he is the man!. Mia Sara is also AMAZING as always and is amazing here she is STUNNINGLY GORGEOUS! was fantastic in the acting department had amazing chemistry with Van Damme had a great smile and was especially good in the finale! she is one of my favorite actresses. Mia Sara rules!!!!. Ron Silver is wonderful as the evil Senator McComb he had some awesome one liners had some great scenes with Van Damme was extremely menacing and just did a wonderful job overall!. Silver Rules. Bruce McGill is great in his role he was very likable and did a great job i liked him lots. Gloria Reuben is hot and did excellent with what she had to do although i wished she had more screen time. Rest of the cast do great.Overall if you haven't seen this do so immediately you won't regret it it's one of the best ActionSciFi films ever made and Van Damme's 3rd best.  out of 5".

	schema:reviewBody "Probably Van Damme's last big hit Timecop is a mix of action scifi timetravel and revenge with the usual roundhouse kicking fun. The big budget is clear to see with a myriad of special effects and explosions every few minutes. What makes Timecop better though is a decent story even though it follows the usual revenge theme a good script and s decent cast to back up Van Damme.Van Damme stars as Max a cop with a difference in the future. Time Travelling has been nearperfected and Max is a Timecop an elite crime fighter with the special authority to travel through time to stop criminals. Only a few people are authorised to use this technology but naturally some bad guys get there hands on it and plan to change the past. A few years earlier Max's wife had been murdered. When Max learns of a sinister plot involving Senator McComb who plans to become President by going back in time Max takes the law into his own hands and goes back to stop him. This leads to further trouble of course and Max soon sets out to save his wife as well.The time travelling stuff is handled to an average degree certainly not as good as in Back to the Future or The Terminator but it's adequate. Van Damme has enough star quality now to carry the film but Silver and Sara provide strong support. The effects are mostly very good the action scenes are exciting and there is some honour and a few good oneliners. Probably a good one to watch for people coming to Van Damme movies for the first time as it delivers what it promises and doesn't try to be special.7.5 out of 10".

Oh yeah and what was up with the villain's death scene? That was some frighteningly terrible CGI. I guess they were trying to rival the liquid metal effects in T2 and failed miserably. In fact the entire finale was way too dark like pitch black. I remember catching the finale on TV back in the day and noticed it was excessively dark then too but Bluray doesn't seem to have corrected the problem.

	schema:reviewBody "Time travel is always a neat concept when it comes to movies. It also can be quite confusing. And because there are these too extremes to using this idea only some people can use it wisely enough and not have the film involve too much time travel. Director Peter Hyams displays that he's one of those people who can handle this kind of situation. From start to finish I was thoroughly sure I knew where and what was going on. I wasn't confused once. This shows Hyams had control of how much time travel was used in one instance.Timecop is actually a generalization for the people who do the job but focuses on the story of Max Walker JeanClaude Van Damme a man who belongs to an institution of individuals who police time based on a popular Dark Horse comic. As stated time travel was discovered in 1994 and now there are people needed to prevent the past from being altered. One thing I didn't understand was that throughout the entire film I only saw about two or three timecops. Where's everyone else? However I only noticed this after the film had ended. I was too busy focusing on what was currently happening on screen.Going back to Van Damme I was somewhat skeptical about his performance but in the end I had much appreciation for it. However my only complaint is that he reminds me of other actors. His voice sounds a little like Antonio Banderas his fighting techniques and flexibility which are impressive look too much like Jackie Chan's style and lastly he sports this Peter Weller hairdo as if he were playing Alex Murphy from RoboCop 1987 and not a timecop. I'm not saying this is bad but I was hoping Van Damme would come out as his own actor and not like someone else. Like I said though Van Damme is cool when he's fighting and he also has some comical moments too. I liked the character of Max Walker I just thought he'd be somewhat more original and not a knock off of some other character.Playing the villain Aaron McComb is Ron Silver a corrupt politician who will do anything to make sure he's sitting in the president's chair by the end of the election. Even Silver has some unique moments where he lashes out at characters and then abruptly simmers down. This shows good characterization because it reveals what a loose cannon McComb is and why he's not fit for a president. Mia Sara portrays Max Walker's wife Melissa Walker. I also think that the two actors made a good couple too bad it wasn't real. Melissa definitely may not be a physically strong character but she has a hardy spirit. As the film came to its finale I had a fondness for her bravery.The special effects are also fair game. There wasn't anything that seemed to be overloaded with CGI and the idea of matter occupying two spaces at one time is also another visual treat to see. The part where the film shows how the police go back in time was intriguing as well. It recalled what it was like to first watch Back to the Future 1985 with a speeding vehicle hurtling towards some wall and then suddenly disappearing with track marks ablaze. Mark Isham composed the score to this film. Sadly I did not feel a whole lot from it but and maybe that's because there was no theme song to it. But it definitely was a soundtrack because it wasn't noise like Keith Emerson's score from Nighthawks 1981. What a mess that was!Peter Hyams' direction on the Dark Horse comic of a time traveling police officer not only boasts visuals but also has a great story line. The characters are nicely acted and the action scenes are well played.".

	schema:reviewBody "Simply put I dig this cop. A friend of mine wrote this film before his death. Based on a comic book following. I think even with the regular mode of acting that Mr. Van Damme has this was on the level as well as an over the edge thriller! The story I loved with the turn in plot etc etc but I found this as many times as I have seen it is still a movie that can glue me to my seat. It is always a wild ride with one Hell of a punch! I like the fact that our hero loves his wife and family in the end with the family. He is a solid character to lean on. He is honest and true to his work and dealing with the criminal element. This was and still is a hard driving story that's why it was in 1994 Number One at the Box Office. Again however Peter Hyams the director and visionarycreative force has a way with his characters in shooting scenes the way the light is brought about from the foreground and the back drop and everything in between. I passed on a chance to meet Mr.Hyams at a friends house in Summerland Ca back in 1994. What an idiot I was! I don't believe too much time goes by that I don't want to kick myself in my own ass for passing up the chance to meet a master craftsman in the arena of Hollywood film. This action drama doesn't let down! It is a knockdown dragout festival of action maneuvering and intellectual willing against a stronger more powerful force than himselfMax. I fully enjoyed Bruce McGill as commander Matuzak the lead guy in charge. I thought that was a different pick then I would have cast in the beginning but he was actually better than I imagined! He seems to have an air of craziness and civility together that works out in the part that he is playing. Max Walker Van Damme was a likable guy I think and that's what gives the film more appeal to the masses. He is someone you want to root for again and again.I recommend this thriller action drama for action and good twisted plot lovers.".

To start with most action films will get science fiction dead wrong. Well I was pleasantly surprised with this film as I couldn't tell if it was scientifically correct or not because nothing was ever explained. Well that at least saves me the trouble of rolling my eyes every ten seconds. The only beef I have about the time travel in this film really awful effects aside... was the fact that as the past kept changing not only did there seem to be no major effect on the future if a bunch of gold gets stolen from the past that would effect lord knows how much of the future economy as everything that was bought with that gold would be completely wiped out but nobody involved seemed to have their memories altered. If I go into the past and change something directly affecting me my memories should constantly shift to reflect that. As well if I go back into the past and meet my wife she should remember that meeting in the future. Oh wait I guess my only beef was pretty much the centrepoint of the film. Tsktsk. That aside let's talk about the ripoff element. Aside from the obvious Back to the Future swipes the car being the most obvious... how much of Batman can be stolen in a bloody time travel film? A lot apparently. From the music especially in the final showdown scene to the roof scene oh look Batman...I mean Van Damme and Kim Basinger...I mean Mia Sara are hanging off the rooftop. Oh look he's holding her with one arm while his other hand holding him aloft is being stepped on by the Jok...er...the bad guy.... As well there was the predictable bad dialogue Here's a hint JC when Arnie does it it's funny... and worse acting why did Gloria Reuben do this film again? and as for the martial arts...well I know JC's no Jet Li but could he at least make it look almost real? I hold you I punch you you stand completely still watching me until I make contact you react you hold me you punch me I stand completely still all the while until you make contact etc. An essential part of what makes a good martial arts fight good is that both fighters are constantly moving and reacting. It's textbook film fighting...I mean come on even Chuck Norris knows that much! And the plot? 'What plot' you ask? Well there was indeed a plot. But it was so fragmented that although I knew what was happening. I could barely make out why it was happening. There was absolutely NO explanation of what was going on. The audience is just supposed to accept everything at face value and assume that the massive rifts and holes in the plot make sense on some unknown level. But hey that's a cheezy action film for you. But tell me did it need the horribly gratuitous sex scenes? Two scenes that served absolutely no purpose except to show off skin. And granted Mia Sara's not ugly but this isn't exactly a film that needs bared breasts to make money...or maybe it is. But still it ruins the film. And seeing Jean Claude's butt doesn't exactly send chills down my spine...well it does but the wrong kind of chills I'm still a little queasy and it's been a couple of hours... And to make matters worse this has every element of a textbook action film every cliche and stereotype imaginable from slomo to timed explosives. All in all? At least it's short. Fastpaced. And the plot is amusing enough to keep me from turning the TV off. 410.".

It's also interesting how before James Cameron Hyams was trying to create the contemporary scifi film without the intervention of the space opera element.  Needless to say he's not as sophisticated as Cameronif you want to label him as such.End of Days the Relic and the Musketeer all further in Hyams' rather selfdestructive course into less and less intelligent film if he was ever intelligent to start with and I can guarantee his next works will be bargainbin only material.  He is making the same movie over and over and only tries to make difference by recasting and swapping elements.Timecop not only infuses the techie aspects of the Back to the Future and Terminator movies but strips itself of the human elements that made the other two series better.  JCVD is not an expressive actor since his only asset is physical control.  Bruce Lee knew he was an inferior actor so he stuck to his moves Van Damme doesn't.Overall this is Hyams where he should stay the lowbudget scifiaction field because he can't rise to anything else.  As a filmmaker all around I give him 2 out of 5 stars.  Same for this movie.".

Jakob uses the chance to spread hope throughout the ghetto by continuing to tell favorable tales of information from his secret radio.

He is an ordinary man and as terrified of the Nazis as any of his neighbors in the ghetto. He blunders his way into his unlikely role as a keeper of hope and once there cannot see from moment to moment how he can maintain it wishes at times he could be rid of the burden and yet somehow manages to continue to inspire others who are so desperate for hope they don't even try to disbelieve. In short don't be fooled by the title Jakob is just this guy plotwise he is only a hub around which a large wheel turns. There were parts that didn't work for me especially pieces where narration would have worked better than a character monologue Jakob is a narrator as well as a character so why does he talk to himself instead of us so much? But on the whole it was a good story well performed by those involved.The ending which I shall refrain from describing for the benefit of any who have not seen it is absolutely fitting. It is surreal which may bother some but leaves the door open to so many interpretations that you will wonder whether to take it as the true end or whether it was Jakob's final lie. And fittingly the decision is left in the mind of the viewer.".

	schema:reviewBody "Over the years I have found Robin Williams to be one of the most frustrating actors around. Clearly loaded with talent in my opinion at least most of his movies have been disappointments. He either gives unnecessarily overthetop performances that really don't fit the context or he controls his natural comedic instincts to the point at which he comes across as uninspired. So I wasn't sure what to expect in Jakob the Liar. What I found was a surprisingly good performance in a wonderful movie.Williams plays Jakob Heym confined to the Jewish Ghetto of Warsaw by the Nazis during the Second World War. With hope fading Heym accidentally discovers that Russian troops aren't far away and begins to spread the news. Others become convinced that he has a radio hidden and Heym's fictional news reports from the BBC provide enough hope to keep the residents of the Ghetto going through this dark time.Williams also executive producer did a fine job as Heym. As one would expect his character comes across as something of a comedian I believe we're God's Chosen People I just wish He had chosen someone else! but his humour is appropriate the sort of dark humour one would expect from people in this situation. The other performances faded into the background not because they were bad but because Williams so dominated the movie. Special mention should go to Justus von Dohnanyi though who played the Nazi Commandant Preuss. Dohnanyi manages to capture exactly the sort of slimy inhuman character one would expect to be put in charge of such a business. The rest of the cast primarily Hannah TaylorGordon as Lina and Liev Schreiber as Mischa are good but overshadowed by Williams.The character of Kirschbaum played by Armin MuellerStahl filled me with sadness and represents a clear statement of the evils of Nazism. A worldfamous cardiologist Kirschbaum because he is Jewish is forbidden to practice medicine and ends up cleaning toilets. MuellerStahl plays the character with a quiet dignity and next to Williams is the clear highlight of the movie.This movie represents a wonderful testimony to the importance of hope in helping people see themselves through what must seem to be impossible situations. Although fictional it is an important movie for those with an interest in the events of this era.710".

	schema:headline " Robin Williams should really stick to more serious roles like this.";
	schema:reviewBody "I was completely stunned at how well Robin Williams pulled off more serious dramatic roles since he's much more wellknown for highenergy comedy. But his roles as the bad guy in movies like Insomnia or even better One Hour Photo display the extent of his acting abilities since he is able to pull off such different characters so well. In Jakob the Liar his comedic talents are restricted just enough so that he is able to function properly within the atmosphere of the movie but is still allowed a scene or two in which his ability to get laughs can come out. He plays Jakob a Jewish shopkeeper in a Nazi ghetto who tells a friend that he has a radio in order to prevent that friend from committing suicide.Things do not appear to be going well within the ghetto the war seems like it will never end and morale among the imprisoned Jews is steadily waning resulting in suicides left and right. As Jakob finds a friend of his doing something that will certainly get him killed by the Nazis this particular friend decided to make a hamhanded attempt at escape rather than overtly kill himself Jakob runs to him and tells him that he heard on the radio that the Russians were closing in and would liberate them any day. His skeptical friend doubts him so Jakob quickly tells him that he has a radio so that he will believe the Russians will be there to save them all soon and his friend's suicide is prevented.By the next morning literally everyone in the ghetto knows that Jakob Heym has a radio and so he is venerated like a God and constantly hounded about what the newest news is and thus enters the main conflict of the movie. And speaking of which one of the things that I really liked about the movie was the complexity of its conflict. It's a conflict that you sit there knowing what needs to happen for a happy ending and so you sit there and hope for that because every option has terrible consequences.Jakob first and foremost is absolutely terrified that word will reach the Nazis who will execute him if they discover he has a radio whether he really has it or not yet at the same time he can't let it get out within the ghetto that he DOESN'T have a radio because since the whole rumor began the rampant suicides have completely ceased. What he has to do then is walk the fine line between delivering lots of fictitious good news to the whole ghetto without letting the Nazis find out about it.There is definitely something that needs to be said about the importance of a movie like this. Obviously holocaust movies are nothing new and different depictions of the holocaust have been especially in the spotlight since Roberto Benigni made a holocaust movie called Life Is Beautiful in 1997 at least half of which was a comedy. A lot of people felt that it was distasteful to present something as serious and tragic as the holocaust in such a light. And not just average moviegoers like me either. Spielberg thought it was too lighthearted for such weighty subject matter and from a certain point of view he's right. On the other hand however the fact that you laughed during the film does not change the meaning of the war that it focuses on. The Nazis killed funny people too.I read a review on the title page for Jakob the Liar here on the IMDb where a reviewer who completely missed the boat on this movie criticized it for things like the comedic content the behavior and presentation of the Jews of the ghetto and the choice of Robin Williams for the role of Jakob Heym. To be perfectly honest I can never understand people like that. The way I see it as long as a movie takes the holocaust seriously then it should not be criticized for being a holocaust film that's not in the right format or that had an actor who has done too many comedy roles. This same reviewer by the way praised Life Is Beautiful a spectacular film as is Jakob the Liar.I can certainly understand that there are people who are touchy about the holocaust. It is inarguably one of the most tragic events in all of recorded human history made even more tragic by the fact that it was perpetrated by humans against other humans. It's sickening. But there are no jokes about the holocaust in Jakob the Liar. The Jews do not act like victims. It is historically accurate and does not compromise the truth of what happened for the sake of entertainment. It presents a story of a ghetto full of captive Jews who have had their lives stolen from them and are desperate for some hope and one man tries to help and inadvertently finds himself in a position to provide massive amounts of hope to them but at massive risk to his own safety.So if you don't like to see Robin Williams playing serious dramatic roles roles at which he is increasingly displaying his massive talent  don't watch the movie! It is neither a secret that Williams is in the movie nor that it's a serious role. One look at the cover box will tell you that. But if it's the holocaust being taken seriously that troubles you maybe you should be more concerned about the fact that there are people alive TODAY here in the 21st Century and presumably relatively educated American citizens who DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE HOLOCAUST EVER EVEN HAPPENED. So like I said if you're that concerned about the portrayal of the holocaust maybe focus your efforts on these nutcases who have convinced themselves that the holocaust itself is just a fable. Maybe a myth that mothers started telling their kids to make them scared of Germans or some other such nonsense.Jakob the Liar has no illusions it takes a tragedy in human history and tells a story of a man who did what he could to help those suffering around him and Robin Williams should obviously be commended for the power of his performance as should the rest of the cast. The thing to keep in mind is that there is no certain perspective from which to view things like the holocaust. Everyone has different thoughts and feelings about it and in the movies these different perspectives can be provided in different ways without compromising the severity and finality of the event itself. Jakob the Liar does not at all trivialize the holocaust in any way what it does is honor the loss of its victims who came from all walks of life.".

Maybe a myth that mothers started telling their kids to make them scared of Germans or some other such nonsense.Jakob the Liar has no illusions it takes a tragedy in human history and tells a story of a man who did what he could to help those suffering around him and Robin Williams should obviously be commended for the power of his performance as should the rest of the cast. The thing to keep in mind is that there is no certain perspective from which to view things like the holocaust. Everyone has different thoughts and feelings about it and in the movies these different perspectives can be provided in different ways without compromising the severity and finality of the event itself. Jakob the Liar does not at all trivialize the holocaust in any way what it does is honor the loss of its victims who came from all walks of life.";

I think he has come a long way since Mork and Mindy.   This movie was very good.  It is a movie about the holocaust in Poland.  It takes place in the ghetto and tells of a used to be restaurant owner who here's some propaganda on the radio in the gestapos office and ends up telling lies to boost his fellow mans moral.  I don't want to go into detail to much cuz it would spoil the movie for you.  Also he meets a little girl who escaped from a train to the camps and befriends Jakob who takes her in and takes care of her.  They have a very cute relationship. All in all I thought this movie was very well done and portrayed the holocaust in a very realistic way.  The cast was very good..........you must go see this movie!!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Personally I found very touching  heart wrenching this story of one man's efforts to lift spirits in a World War II Jewish ghetto in Poland. Many have compared it to Life is Beautiful and there are some similarities. I can understand why some viewers take offense at any film which might seem to trivialize the Holocaust but I found Life is Beautiful not disrespectful but deeply moving and consider this particular tale to be a captivating depiction of one individual's unique attempt to keep hope alive in a desperate situation.The story revolves around a lonely Polish shopkeeper  widower Jakob who is confined to a Jewish ghetto in 1944. When summoned to ghetto headquarters for being out after curfew he hears a radio report about Russian troop movements. To prevent a friend's suicide he claims to have heard on his radio that the Russians are very close within a few hundred kilometers and will liberate the ghetto soon causing rumours that Jakob has a secret radio. Instead of telling the truth he tries to lift spirits and impart hope to the war weary  depressed ghetto inhabitants by maintaining the fiction of possessing this radio and regularly disseminating uplifting fictional news bulletins about the Allies' progress. Meanwhile Jakob is also hiding a young Jewish girl who escaped from a camp transport. The Germans hear reports of this forbidden radio and are seeking out the resistance operator of it.Robin Williams dominates this movie and is brilliant as usual in the endearing sympathetic role of the kind Jakob who must try to balance getting out lots of hopeful if fictitious war reports to keep spirits up while at the same time avoid Nazi suspicion and detection.The movie portrays the despair of the ghetto's inhabitants and the grave injustice of their captive state. For example Jewish people are prohibited from practicing medicine and a cardiologist is reduced to cleaning toilets though does so with good humour grace and dignity. On the whole it is a very poignant tale with any humour having a sad note to it. Jakob the Liar shows another tragic aspect of the Holocaust. Rather than the horrors of the concentration camps that are often the setting of such stories here we see the injustice and despair of prolonged ghetto captivity.".

In Jakob's final narration he was trying to instill hope in the viewers just like he did with his people when he falsely said he had the radio.  This is evident when he says Or MAYBE...  He made many of the hopeful things up throughout the movie so that's why I think he made up the happy ending.    Now to the review...A very good movie.  It seems overlong at times but the wonderful performance of Robin Williams as Jakob held my interest very much.  This is a dreary depressing film and hardly has any humor.  The type of humor found in this movie is extremely dry and isn't for everyone I know it isn't my type.  As for the cinematography well it was wonderful.  There's not much color in this film only drab and soft brown black and gray tones which add to the atmosphere of sadness.  Overall a very effective film.    Rating  7.5 out of 10".

This film sometimes tries to be Hogan's Hero's' in its farcical sendup of German captivity and at other times it tries to be Schindler's List' with disturbing portrayals of the inhumanity of the holocaust.  Unlike Life is Beautiful' which was a bittersweet story lovingly done this story is merely distasteful and makes a mockery of the plight of the Jews in captivity during WWII.  It portrays the citizens of the ghetto as bumbling idiots with little regard for the gravity of their situation.  A holocaust story is no place for Keystone Cops comedy skits.Director Peter Kassovitz gives us nothing distinctive from a visual standpoint nor does he bring forth the proper tone and mood from the actors.  The acting is uniformly mediocre.  Alan Arkin has given us numerous excellent performances but his character was so insubstantial and inane it was difficult for him not to look foolish.  Liev Schreiber as Mischa made the character into a complete buffoon perhaps that is what Kassovitz intended.   Finally Robin Williams needs to seek career counseling.  He keeps taking these poignant comedic roles that are just not right for his talents.  He needs to realize his limitations and embrace his genius.  He is incomparable in frenetic over the edge comedic roles that require quick witted ad libs and shock comedy.  As a serious actor he is simply unexceptional and his attempts at such are especially disappointing when compared against his true ability.I rated this film a 410.  If it was a holocaust story that needed to be told it certainly needed to be told differently.".

	schema:headline " Please Don't Let This Film Be Forgotten...";
	schema:reviewBody "Wow. Jakob the Liar. Where to being with this movie? I mean it's pretty under the radar as far as WWII movies about Jews in the ghetto go. I hate to say it but that whole concept is frankly getting a little boring. Add in some generic scores from multiple review sites and this movie seems doomed to be forgotten. Jakob the Liar tells the story of wait for it Jakob Hyem. The movie begins with Jakob played by Robin Williams in one of his surprisingly many serious roles narrating a joke to the audience. Hitler goes to a fortuneteller and asks 'When will I die?' And the fortuneteller replies 'On a Jewish holiday.' Hitler then asks 'How do you know that?' And she replies 'Any day you die will be a Jewish holiday.' This basically sets up the entire tone of the movie. It's a film about finding hope through humor in a pretty terrible situation. This isn't a new concept but it knows that from beginning to end ESPECIALLY at the end but I'll get to that later. Anyway fastforward a bit and Jakob finds himself awaiting punishment for a pretty harmless crime in the office of a German soldier. While he awaits the officer's actual arrival he manages to overhear a radio telling of Russia's arrival into Germany. So Jakob goes on with his life until he one day stops one of his fellow workers from doing something drastic by telling him of the news he heard on the radio. The worker taking this out of context assumes Jakob has a secret forbidden radio in his home. Despite Jakob's explanations denouncing this idea the man simply assumes this is all a front so as not to get in trouble with the Gestapo. The news of Jakob's radio of course spreads quickly throughout the entire ghetto. Suddenly Jakob has many new friends. He continues to deny owning a radio out of fear for his life but quickly realizes the actual hope it brings to these people. So he inevitably continues the lie by making up new stories on a regular basis of the Russian front which his coworkers eat up like candy. Let me just say this about his coworkers. I don't know why but I absolutely fell in love with these people. Maybe it was the surprisingly stellar performances from a movie that I thought would just be mediocre. Maybe it was the Mountain Dew I just happened to chug right as I started watching this. Either way this was one of those movies that makes you go Oh hey! It's THAT guy! Hold on. Pause the movie for a sec. I gotta go look up who these guys are and what else they've been in or I won't be able to focus. So in this cavalcade we've got Liev Sabretooth from XMen Schreiber Mark Tio from television's Breaking Bad Margolis Bob Captain Orr from Catch22 Balaban Michael Mr. Noodle from Sesame Street Jeter and the always amazing Alan Too Many Characters to List Arkin. This was hands down one of my favorite casts to follow throughout a film. Each actor took their character's unique traits in stride making for some great backandforth dialogue. You can tell they each truly enjoyed their characters leading to dare I say it some of the best performances in all of their careers. But Hawkeye why should I care about pretty good acting in a movie about the Holocaust when I can just go watch Schindler's List? Well eager reader I'm actually glad you brought that film up. Here have a cookie. Honestly I don't think this movie wants to be associated with Schindler's List or any of that film's wannabes. For instance this film has Robin Williams as its titular character. That right there should show you how much this movie wants to be associated as something different. This was a film that dared to say Hey. Let's tone down the overthetop empathy for once shall we? I think this is both where the film excelled and doomed itself. You see normally movies like this end with a big tearworthy speech from the hero. Insteadwell I don't want to spoil anything but here are Robin William's words basically spelling out the reality of trying to live each day as a Jew during the Holocaust So that's how it ended. I never got a chance to be the big hero and make my big speech. I swear I had a speech all prepared about freedom and never giving in. But somehow... Yes that's how it ended. They all went off to the camps and were never seen again. But maybe it wasn't like that at all. In a way it all sort of reminded me of the film Waltz With Bashir. Like Bashir's Ari Folman Jakob is more of an observer than an actual hero per se. He wants and tries to be a hero but he has a certain sense of reality I absolutely fell in love with that Robin Williams truly brings to life. In fact I think I'm going to have to say this was Robin Williams best serious acting role. It definitely was my favorite. If for some reason none of this has caught your fancy at least watch Jakob the Liar for what I believe to be one of the most memorable monologues I've heard in a long time. We find Jakob alone in front of his pancake shop contemplating the mess he's just gotten himself into with the radio. Solemnly he takes a seat and stares at the ground before beginning to talk aloud to no one in particular. Yeah it is crazy. I know. But when I started to make up those things...I almost believed them. I know. The point is what am I going to invent tomorrow? In my whole life my greatest invention was an apricot pancake. A latke. My crowning achievement Latkes and lies.".

Horrible things happened back then and now there are movies to show us it all.This is a movie about hope.Hope is still there in the dramatic ending.Hope is seen through the tears.Isn't that hope all we need in the end?";

We as humans are so receptive to myth legend and rumours. Yet before the truth is given a chance to be known we block our ears close our eyes and run away.The Hendersons Jacques LeFleur a hunter who has followed his trail for 25 years and Dr Wrightwood a man whose life has been ruined by his dedication towards the study of Sasquatch all gain a new perspective on life as well as a new respect. Their original feelings of the Beast all quashed swiftly to realize that inside of it lay a big heart.Harry's compassion love for other beings and respect for life made this film an absolute delight to watch.

	schema:reviewBody "Harry and the Hendersons is one of the first films I remember seeing in the cinema as a kid. It was 1987 and my uncle had just passed his driving test so he was well into driving places and the cinema just happened to be one of them.Even though the film is only 110 minutes long they still had an intermission halfway through for some reason. And I swear they actually had ushers coming round selling stuff before it started back up again. I believe that is the first and only time I have seen such oldfashioned picturehouse practices. But it makes my original memory of this film so much more nostalgic.The Hendersons consist of wannabe artistgun salesman dad George that always brilliant John Lithgow loving mum Melinda Dillon a bratty daughter and a hyperactive son. On returning from a camping trip in the Pacific Northwest they accidentally run into some sort of large furry creature on the forest road. Originally believing it to be a bear George steps out of the car to prod it with his gun a few times. But the bear has manlike hands and George suddenly asks his family 'What if it's...HIM'.Bigfoot! Think of how much he's worth! So they tie him to the roof of the car and drive him home while George thinks of the best way of selling him. Later that night he is curious as to how big his feet really are. So he sneaks down to the garage with a measuring tape only to find that he's no longer strapped to the roof of the car but poking around in the kitchen fridge.The Hendersons stand back as bigfoot or Harry as he is later renamed stomps around the house and garden investigating all their strange belongings. Though he doesn't care much for all the animal trophies hanging around everywhere. Freaking out George tries to snipe Harry from through the bedroom window but has a change of heart when he realises that Harry is just big harmless oaf.The best scenes of the film involve Harry making himself at home in the Henderson house. His mannerisms and body language are similar to a child warned to be on their best behavior while visiting old relatives. He constantly looks a bit nervous and uncomfortable but is always ready to grab you for a big hug.Rick Baker deservedly took home an Academy Award for Best MakeUp Effects back in 1988 for this movie. Harry Henderson is an amazing character with a wonderfully wide range of expressions and emotions. All E.T. ever did was sit there looking bugeyed. Not Harry though you can't help loving him. I so want my own Bigfoot.Even now as an adult I think this movie is still great. As a kid I remember feeling the panic and excitement when Harry got lost in Seattle and the halfcrazed Bigfoot hunter Jacques LaFleur David Suchet doing lots of sleaziness in order to have him shot gutted and sold to science. Forgive the repeated comparison but to me it was more involving and fun than the man with the keys in E.T.You just don't get family movies like this anymore. Back in the 80's Steven Spielberg's Amblin production company made loads of great family movies like Gremlins Goonies the Back to the Future Trilogy Young Sherlock Holmes and Innerspace. They all had some kind highconcept spin that crud such as Like Mike and Crapper by the Dozen don't.It was a great time to be a kid back in those days. We weren't cynical and jaded and hooked on Playstation like modern children. We still had a sense of adventure a longing for the outdoors. Anything could be out there. Maybe Harry is actually bumbling around in the woods as I write this. Like the PattersonGimlin film that inspired it Harry and the Hendersons is one movie that will be timeless forever.".

Originally believing it to be a bear George steps out of the car to prod it with his gun a few times. But the bear has manlike hands and George suddenly asks his family 'What if it's...HIM'.Bigfoot! Think of how much he's worth! So they tie him to the roof of the car and drive him home while George thinks of the best way of selling him. Later that night he is curious as to how big his feet really are. So he sneaks down to the garage with a measuring tape only to find that he's no longer strapped to the roof of the car but poking around in the kitchen fridge.The Hendersons stand back as bigfoot or Harry as he is later renamed stomps around the house and garden investigating all their strange belongings. Though he doesn't care much for all the animal trophies hanging around everywhere. Freaking out George tries to snipe Harry from through the bedroom window but has a change of heart when he realises that Harry is just big harmless oaf.The best scenes of the film involve Harry making himself at home in the Henderson house. His mannerisms and body language are similar to a child warned to be on their best behavior while visiting old relatives. He constantly looks a bit nervous and uncomfortable but is always ready to grab you for a big hug.Rick Baker deservedly took home an Academy Award for Best MakeUp Effects back in 1988 for this movie. Harry Henderson is an amazing character with a wonderfully wide range of expressions and emotions. All E.T. ever did was sit there looking bugeyed. Not Harry though you can't help loving him. I so want my own Bigfoot.Even now as an adult I think this movie is still great. As a kid I remember feeling the panic and excitement when Harry got lost in Seattle and the halfcrazed Bigfoot hunter Jacques LaFleur David Suchet doing lots of sleaziness in order to have him shot gutted and sold to science. Forgive the repeated comparison but to me it was more involving and fun than the man with the keys in E.T.You just don't get family movies like this anymore. Back in the 80's Steven Spielberg's Amblin production company made loads of great family movies like Gremlins Goonies the Back to the Future Trilogy Young Sherlock Holmes and Innerspace. They all had some kind highconcept spin that crud such as Like Mike and Crapper by the Dozen don't.It was a great time to be a kid back in those days. We weren't cynical and jaded and hooked on Playstation like modern children. We still had a sense of adventure a longing for the outdoors. Anything could be out there. Maybe Harry is actually bumbling around in the woods as I write this. Like the PattersonGimlin film that inspired it Harry and the Hendersons is one movie that will be timeless forever.";

The visual effects team did an incredible job on the range of emotions Harry shows and to this date I have not seen a movie which has had animatronics as lifelike as they are here.The chase sequence as Harry gets lost in the city is the worst part of the movie where the cheese is laid on thick and stinky  for a scene designed to perhaps create drama it is unintentionally goofy and seeks to make the plot drag unnecessarily. However once the Hendersons get Harry back the movie picks up again for the final heartwarming forest sequence.Still one of my favorite movies.".

I heard mixed things about it and the idea of Warren Beatty playing a vicious mobster kind of seemed unbelievable to me he did a great job in 'Bonnie and Clyde' but that was a little different. In all honesty I really found 'Bugsy' to not only be a very entertaining and enjoyable film but also very wellmade and Oscarworthy one. Warren Beatty gives an unprecedented performance as the tough mafioso Bugsy Siegel who first had the idea of putting casinos in Las Vegas. Annette Bening in an equally brilliant performance plays Bugsy's calculating goomar. The supporting cast is very solid with strong performances from Elliot Gould Joe Mantegna as actor George Raft and especially Ben Kingsley as the swift and smart mobster with a heart of gold and Harvey Keital as the mean and ruthless killer who becomes partners with Siegel to start up a hotelcasino. Barry Levinson does a great job directing this period piece which is true to the period the 1940s and the screenplay isn't half bad either. Beatty Keital and Kingsley picked up Oscar nods along with Levinson for Best Director and the wonderful Annette Bening was somehow unfairly snubbed. If you want to see a cool mob picture that takes place in the 40s why don't you give 'Bugsy' a shot? It's worth it. Grade B".

Barry Levinson does a great job directing this period piece which is true to the period the 1940s and the screenplay isn't half bad either. Beatty Keital and Kingsley picked up Oscar nods along with Levinson for Best Director and the wonderful Annette Bening was somehow unfairly snubbed. If you want to see a cool mob picture that takes place in the 40s why don't you give 'Bugsy' a shot? It's worth it. Grade B";

	schema:reviewBody "After staying at the Las Vegas Flamingo and spending a substantial amount of time browsing through the artifacts of old Vegas at the Las Vegas History Museum at the Tropicana Hotel this is one movie I wanted to watch when I got back. Not that I'm a fan of Warren Beatty I only watched his Dick Tracy movie but I'm interested in the Hollywood retelling of Benjamin Bugsy Siegel's story.For the uninitiated Siegel was a gangster who loves his family but is as horny as he can get. He falls in love with the Hollywood glamour and life and comes to know his new mistress a starlet called Virginia Hill Annette Bening who's known in some circles as the village bicycle  everyone's had a ride.Seigel shares a lovehate relationship with Hill and it is always bumpy. And little does he know that this love will ultimately cause his downfall and demise. Love aside there's also plenty of scenes that shows Siegel's violent nature hey he's a gangster and scenes too that highlights his disregard for money  he spends lavishly. There's a subplot about Mussolini too which highlights Seigel's eccentricity.But he does have a vision and that was having the foresight of predicting how Las Vegas would become as important as can be with the erection of the Hoover Dam to provide it with electricity. He's the one with the vision of creating something in the middle of the desert which we know today as the Strip with casinos hotels and entertainment from class acts. His vision started off as The Flamingo hotel which over blew its budget by almost 5 million dollars at that time. Of course when you're dealing with mob money you'd better be careful as they become impatient with his grander vision of controlling a casino city state and ultimately having the power to influence presidential elections.Directed by Barry Levinson Bugsy is the tale of that one man's vision. It's well acted with a superb supporting cast. Keeping true to the finale watch out for that flying eye too. And yes Beatty and Bening met on set and married thereafter.Sadly this Code 1 DVD contains no special extras.".

	schema:headline " The Definitive Biopic";
	schema:reviewBody "Winner of two Oscars and nominated for many more Bugsy is a tour DE force in the area of biography on film. It is the definitive film of it's genre for the 1990s and on.I love the biographical film genre for many reasons. First of all they offer a glimpse of what life was for people we all know and in many cases wish we could be. Secondly most of the time you know the outcome of the story. The main character dies makes millions goes to jail etc. With out the pressure of guessing the ending the viewer is free to concentrate on the film as a whole and thus enjoy it totally. Bugsy Seigel's world holds film appeal for two reasons. First and most obvious is that he was a gangster. Gangster movies have held the attention of the movie going public since the 1920s. Secondlyhe was in Hollywood in the 1940's possibly the most glamorous decade Tinseltown ever saw.Director Barry Levinson managed to take these two very different yet very intoxicating styles and stories to create a heady blend that produced what may be the best biopic made. Levinson's and writer James Toback's genius was in the decision to forgo the usual hodgepodge of life events in favor of making what is essentially a love story.The focus of the film is essentially the tempestuous love affair between Siegel and Virginia Hill with the secondary plot being the creation of Vegas as we know it today from Benny's vision of the Flamingo.The best acting by far was by Benning. She was so into her character that if I had not known before hand who she was I would never had known. Her sassypassionate and jealous personality creates fireworks on the screen. It is easy to see that this is where Benning and Beatty met and fell in love. They have a chemistry that I have not seen equaled since Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy were still making movies. Beatty's performance is stellar as wellhe seems at ease in the personification of the first celebrity gangster and is completely believable in his desperation near the end. All the supporting players Keitel Kingsley and Gould especially were amazing as the famous crime figures they portrayed. My one complaint on the casting side is Joe Montagna's George Raft. Why he is continually allowed to appear as and thus insult the memory of famous screen personalities is beyond me. All though he is not nearly as horrible here as he was as Dean Martin in The Rat Pack. To compliment the intense fireworks both romantic and violent a bright visual style is incorporated. The sleek look is total 1940's and the cinematography is genius notably the shot with Benny and Virginia's first kiss. Everything meshes together beautifully to create a gem among films. This is a film about a man of extreme vision and passion and it is a must to see if only to appreciate the beauty of a job well done.".

	schema:headline " 'Bugsy' Destined to be a gangster classic.";
	schema:reviewBody "Barry Levinson's film 'Bugsy' should be considered one of the greatest gangster movies ever made.  Combining a moving plot firstclass acting superb directing and an awardworthy score 'Bugsy' rises above both periodpiece movies and pointless gangster flicks.The plot of the film follows the events in mobster Benjamin 'Bugsy' Siegel's life that culminated in both the founding of Las Vegas and his own death. As the plot includes Siegel's relationship with Virginia Hill it also shows his deteriorating relationship with his family wife Esta and children and associates including Meyer Lansky and Charlie Luciano and it also looks at Siegel's fascination with becoming a celebrity.  Most prominently though is his dream of creating something that something which was the hotel and casino Flamingo.  And it is this plot which artfully switches back and forth between Siegel's personal and business lives that sets the film upon a pedestal so to speak.  It is this blending of personal and professional which sets Bugsy apart from other gangsters by making him human.  Yes he may be a heartless killer a faithless philanderer remorseless criminal hopeless dreamer but those very characteristics are the same which make him more than the runofthemill gangster.  The myth dissolves as the man emerges and the audience sympathizes with Siegel even if they do not approve of him.To say that the acting is excellent hardly does the actors justice. Beatty is a complex and intense Siegel driven by his passions weighted by his faults and ultimately just another flawed individual and not as Siegel once thought indestructible.  Played by Bening Virginia Hill is Siegel's strong counterpoint whose own ambitious and selfinterested exterior is underscored by a caring and sincere interior.  Mickey Cohen is very understated of character sometimes communicating more than just his words a feat performed flawlessly by Keitel.  Kingsley as Meyer Lansky is touchingly caring of his friend Siegel torn between their friendship and his own professionalism.  And the rest of the supporting castincluding Mantegna Gould Sarafian and Grahamis talented and each has an irreplaceable role in the film.Barry Levinson's directing makes the film all the more special.  The shots and angles are all completely appropriate.  The style even seems to lend itself to the feel of the era with the help of great lighting and costuming.  At times the action moves staccato and sharp all business. And then the flow slows down to a more leisurely pace like the era.  At times the directing is even elegant as in the scene at Siegel's house with Virginia where the camera pans to show the two's silhouettes on a projection screen or during their love scene where the time progresses as the camera follows the trail of clothing to the bed when it has become morning or two of the final scenes outside the Flamingo one of Siegel waiting for patrons who do not arrive the other of he and Virginia united for a final time as the rain pours down from a night sky.  Levinson covers a tremendous amount of ground due to the numerous subplots while keeping the momentum.  And the score of the film deserving more awards than it received of 1940's songs including 'Why Don't You Do Right Get Me Some Money Too!' and 'Candy'and Ennio Morricone's original compositions not only sets the tone but the time period.  'For Her For Him' and 'Act of Faith' in particular are simply captivating but the entire score is truly a masterpiece.For such reasons 'Bugsy' is a pleasure to watch over again and is destined to become a classic.".

Combining a moving plot firstclass acting superb directing and an awardworthy score 'Bugsy' rises above both periodpiece movies and pointless gangster flicks.The plot of the film follows the events in mobster Benjamin 'Bugsy' Siegel's life that culminated in both the founding of Las Vegas and his own death. As the plot includes Siegel's relationship with Virginia Hill it also shows his deteriorating relationship with his family wife Esta and children and associates including Meyer Lansky and Charlie Luciano and it also looks at Siegel's fascination with becoming a celebrity.  Most prominently though is his dream of creating something that something which was the hotel and casino Flamingo.  And it is this plot which artfully switches back and forth between Siegel's personal and business lives that sets the film upon a pedestal so to speak.  It is this blending of personal and professional which sets Bugsy apart from other gangsters by making him human.  Yes he may be a heartless killer a faithless philanderer remorseless criminal hopeless dreamer but those very characteristics are the same which make him more than the runofthemill gangster.  The myth dissolves as the man emerges and the audience sympathizes with Siegel even if they do not approve of him.To say that the acting is excellent hardly does the actors justice. Beatty is a complex and intense Siegel driven by his passions weighted by his faults and ultimately just another flawed individual and not as Siegel once thought indestructible.  Played by Bening Virginia Hill is Siegel's strong counterpoint whose own ambitious and selfinterested exterior is underscored by a caring and sincere interior.  Mickey Cohen is very understated of character sometimes communicating more than just his words a feat performed flawlessly by Keitel.  Kingsley as Meyer Lansky is touchingly caring of his friend Siegel torn between their friendship and his own professionalism.  And the rest of the supporting castincluding Mantegna Gould Sarafian and Grahamis talented and each has an irreplaceable role in the film.Barry Levinson's directing makes the film all the more special.  The shots and angles are all completely appropriate.  The style even seems to lend itself to the feel of the era with the help of great lighting and costuming.  At times the action moves staccato and sharp all business. And then the flow slows down to a more leisurely pace like the era.  At times the directing is even elegant as in the scene at Siegel's house with Virginia where the camera pans to show the two's silhouettes on a projection screen or during their love scene where the time progresses as the camera follows the trail of clothing to the bed when it has become morning or two of the final scenes outside the Flamingo one of Siegel waiting for patrons who do not arrive the other of he and Virginia united for a final time as the rain pours down from a night sky.  Levinson covers a tremendous amount of ground due to the numerous subplots while keeping the momentum.  And the score of the film deserving more awards than it received of 1940's songs including 'Why Don't You Do Right Get Me Some Money Too!' and 'Candy'and Ennio Morricone's original compositions not only sets the tone but the time period.  'For Her For Him' and 'Act of Faith' in particular are simply captivating but the entire score is truly a masterpiece.For such reasons 'Bugsy' is a pleasure to watch over again and is destined to become a classic.";

If you want a good solid film about a real life crime figure this is the one. If you want hackneyed worn out cliches that go nowhere and leave a feeling of unsatisfaction I would recommend Mobsters or Billy Bathgate.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bugsy is a typical gangstermob movie it has got the wise guys the families the family problems and a tragic flaw in the protagonist. It is also 2 12 hours long which you should expect with any biopic anyway but I think it can get a little tedious in some areas. First off Warren Beatty is brilliant and there is no question in my mind that it was anything less than perfection. His supporting cast's performances were excellent as well including those of Harvey Keitel Ben Kingsley and Annette Bening. The film probably deserved all the Oscar nominations it received but with the exceptions of Beatty's performance and a couple technical awards nothing deserved the Oscar. However I do not want to give a bad impression of this film because it does deserve some approbation.The story of Bugsy Siegel is indeed a true story. Siegel was a New York Jewish gangster who moved out to L.A. and one thing led to another and resulted in Bugsy building the Flamingo hotel and casino in the middle of the desert. This is the man who put Las Vegas on the map. Bugsy by the way don't call him Bugsy to face is very insane. Also Kingsley's character gets to introduce Bugsy's tragic flaw he doesn't respect money. This combination makes one very unique mobster that I can not compare to any other. Just wait for the scene relating to dogs and pigs I don't want to reveal anymore because this is where Beatty shines. Virginia Hill Bening is a cookie cutter actress going steady with one of Siegel's or somebody else's soldiers. Bugsy starts to look fondly on her and thus starts the romance. There should be no surprise whatsoever since they're married in real life but Beatty and Bening do have great chemistry on screen. Their relationship brings out a lot of fun in the film. Again Bugsy is a tragedy. I don't think that's spoiling it since you can learn that somewhere on the Internet but I do want to let you know what you're getting into. It is a very interesting story with a few laughs and some irony here and there. Barry Levinson made a wellconstructed film that flows very nicely and only lacks where I assume the screenplay does. I would not say it is at the caliber of Goodfellas or The Godfather Trilogy but all in all it is a pretty decent movie.I highly recommend that you definitely see it.".

Beatty may lose it all but then again he may do something truly unforgettable. Bugsy is one of those productions that dominates due to its unforgettable elements. This is an amazing love story that is heartwarming heartbreaking and heartwrenching all at the same time. Based on actual events the filmmakers took a few liberties in the production but the majority of the running time is pretty accurate as to what actually took place in real life. Supporting actors Ben Kingsley Oscarnominated Joe Mantegna and Elliott Gould all do good work in small wellcalculated roles. Bugsy is one of the best films of the 1990s. It stood tall in 1991 as it had more Oscar nominations than any other movie that year. Beatty and Bening's chemistry is exceptional and their love for each other in real life just seems to glisten brightly on the silver screen.

There was so little provocation when she did and yet other times there was so much more reason she should have but she didn't. That was a glaring inconsistency. 3 I thought the lack of better hands on oversight by the mob was not believable. There is simply no way on earth a 1M investment would have ended up costing 6M without every penny being justified. The fact that she made off with 2M is beyond belief. Also why on earth would they have let her live if not before then AFTER they took care of Beatty's character. They would have tortured her to get the money back. 4 How did Beatty get out of the murder wrap?? As I recall one minute he is in jail with no bail and the next minute he is out prancing around. I may have missed something but if I did it is the movie's fault because it was too nebulous.Despite those objections I wanted to know what was going to happen next. I think the main positive of the movie was that this was a true story about a flamboyant charismatic dreamer. And not just any dreamer but the person whose SINGLE unilateral dream eventually became one of the greatest American success stories of all time. He paid the ultimate price for his dream but his dream ultimately came true  in fact to a much greater degree than he even imagined.Typical gangster movie in some ways  not up to the level of the Godfather or Goodfellas or others but stylish and enjoyable to watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having won 2 Oscars and 7 nominations it is clear that Bugsy is no ordinary film. And yet although it can be safely categorized as an impressive piece of work it still has some distinct flaws which keep it back from getting into the masterpiece class.First of all one of the indisputable merits of the film is Barry Levinson's direction. Every scene is meticulously prepared with no detail being ignored one example of his fine work is the scene where Bugsy and Virginia make love for their first time and we watch their shades behind the projector's curtain. Barry Levinson has come up with several other great directions throughout his career Rain Man is a good example but in Bugsy he definitely deserved the golden statute for his excellent work.The performances are also generally good although here my first objections start to appear I completely agreed with the idea of casting Keitel as Bugsy's accomplice and Kingsley as mafia boss they both fit perfectly in their roles and their performances were worthy of their respective legends. However I cannot say the same about the idea of casting Beatty as the paranoid and erratic Bugsy or Benning as his girlfriend Virginia although they both tried hard for some reason their performances didn't quite work out as they should. It seems as if they were the wrong people in the wrong roles. I do not say that Beatty and Benning acted terribly. I simply suggest that their roles should perhaps be awarded to two other actors that would fit more easily in them.And finally let us come to the plot issue which is where the most flaws of Bugsy appear. The story is basically quite interesting This is the tale of Ben Bugsy Siegel a strange and erratic mobster who likes to cheat his committed wife at the first opportunity. His life changes completely when he is sent to L.A. for a job as he becomes immediately attracted to the city's life surroundings and a woman Virginia to whom he becomes fixed. While being there he envisions a great plan to build a site to what will one day will become Las Vegas. Unfortunately his vain and grandiose ways his paranoia and his erratic style make things very difficult for himself and for the people around him.Interesting the plot may be but it suffers from major gaps moreover considering that the plot is based on a true story the existence of implausibilities becomes more annoying. Even if one argues that they serve an artistic purpose I would still like the film to be more rational and realistic.Worse the story sometimes gets into some great lengths becoming somewhat tiring. Of course one could argue that there are gangster movies such as Once Upon A Time In America that also get into great length and still manage to remain masterpieces. Unfortunately Bugsy fails to accomplish this.And yet despite its flaws Bugsy is still a good 710 film. Pity it didn't manage to get an even higher grade though...".

	onyx:emotionText "Having won 2 Oscars and 7 nominations it is clear that Bugsy is no ordinary film. And yet although it can be safely categorized as an impressive piece of work it still has some distinct flaws which keep it back from getting into the masterpiece class.First of all one of the indisputable merits of the film is Barry Levinson's direction. Every scene is meticulously prepared with no detail being ignored one example of his fine work is the scene where Bugsy and Virginia make love for their first time and we watch their shades behind the projector's curtain. Barry Levinson has come up with several other great directions throughout his career Rain Man is a good example but in Bugsy he definitely deserved the golden statute for his excellent work.The performances are also generally good although here my first objections start to appear I completely agreed with the idea of casting Keitel as Bugsy's accomplice and Kingsley as mafia boss they both fit perfectly in their roles and their performances were worthy of their respective legends. However I cannot say the same about the idea of casting Beatty as the paranoid and erratic Bugsy or Benning as his girlfriend Virginia although they both tried hard for some reason their performances didn't quite work out as they should.

Typical for director Barry Levinson it's a big glossy production well cast with reliable talent and tailor made for Oscar consideration with plenty of domestic melodrama and backstage romance plus a memorable histrionic death scene for its star. The script by James Toback opens strong but fatally softens Siegal's lethal character after only one frightening temper tantrum by concentrating more on the underworld myth of the man who 'discovered' Las Vegas.

Orson WellesThe 1990s saw the resurgence of the gangster genre King of New York Bugsy Godfather 3 Miller's Crossing Billy Bathgate Goodfellas Casino Dick Tracy Heat Donnie Brasco A Bronx Tale State of Grace Kansas City etc. Most of these told fairly familiar tales with the exception arguably of the downbeat Donnie Brasco and the offbeat Kansas City. The 1990s also saw a number of gangster films centering on AfricanAmerican crime lords New Jack City Menace to Society Dead Presidents etc the best of these being Clockers and Boyz n the Hood.Released at the forefront of this cycle was Barry Levinson's Bugsy. Based on a screenplay by James Toback the film tells the story of Benjamin Bugsy Siegel Warren Beatty the infamous American gangster.The plot? It is 1941 and Bugsy has left Brooklyn for Southern California. Assisted by childhood pal George Raft Joe Mantegna and local mobster Mickey Cohen Harvey Keitel Bugsy sets about expanding his criminal empire. Along the way he meets Virginia Hill Annette Bening a Hollywood extra. She's proud feisty different a cocktail which sets Bugsy's heart alight. They fall in love.Warren Beatty specialised in playing doomed romantics Splendour in the Grass Bonnie and Clyde Shampoo Reds McCabe and Mrs. Miller etc. In Bugsy he plays a guy caught between the barbarism of the gangster and his own private idealisations. Bugsy dreams of a happy family of an acting career of Hollywood stardom of legitimate business credentials of assassinating Mussolini of a life with Virginia of being a hero all fanciful desires which are thwarted by the realities of being a crime lord. This tugofwar plays out on the local newspapers in which journalists refer to Siegel  much to his chagrin  by his gangland nickname Bugsy rather than Benjamin his proper name.The world necessitates Bugsy be a monster not a dreamer but these are monstrous necessities which Bugsy quickly loses interest in. Bugsy doesn't care about money a fellow crime boss  Ben Kingsley says as Bugsy embarks upon his dream to build a grand hotel in the empty deserts of Las Vegas. Siegel's Flamingo Hotel is originally budgeted at a million dollars but because of his fanaticism it winds up costing investors six times as much. Unsurprisingly Bugsy's shot and killed by his business partners. Years later his hotel not only blossoms into a multibillion dollar industry but becomes the seed from which the entire gambling city of Las Vegas springs. What other obscenities the film asks do neon lights mask?Like most gangster films Bugsy simultaneously romanticises and condemns its central character. Bugsy's nasty unpleasant but also likable doomed caught in a tragedy from which there is no escape. The film's tone itself veers wildly from farcical comedy to the macabre.How to balance a normal family life with the life of a criminal is a trite theme common in gangster films Godfather Goodfellas Scarface Heat Public Enemies etc. Your typical gangster just can't stop killing cops and bad guys long enough to settle down and please his woman. This is the double helix of the genre the gangster's obsessed with cash but never has time for enjoyment. It's a stance mocked in Robert Altman's subversive Thieves Like Us. For Altman there's little meaningful distinction between the desires of the criminal and the civilian and even less distinction between crime politics and legal business.But Barry Levinson is no iconoclast. His Bugsy is yet another gangster constantly hounded by unhappy women all of whom want his time. What's new in Bugsy is that EVERYONE wants a piece of Bugsy. Everyone wants Bugsy to operate on their terms. But Bugsy a dreamer who refuses to abide remains steadfast in his convictions. In a moment of Herzogian madness I will get that boat over that mountain! Bugsy insists that he will build that damn hotel. Nothing will stop him!Unlike most gangster films of the 1990s Bugsy eschews postmodern tricks for an austere classical style reminiscent of Coppola's prestigeous gangster pictures. Though the film indulges in many genre clichs it handles each in a slightly fresh manner. The film benefits from several fine bit parts Keitel and Elliot Gould in particular but mostly it's Warren Beatty who holds things together. Beatty plays Bugsy as a big child and because he's a bit of a wideeyed loser shades of Al Pacino's in Donnie Brasco his Bugsy's all the more endearing. Like most Hollywood biographies the film has very little to do with the real Benjamin Siegel. It was scored by Ennio Morricone whose voluptuous soundtrack doesn't quite suit either Levinson's aesthetic or Toback's prose. 7.910  See Mccabe and Mrs Miller.".

Closely following this period of his life creates a screen version of the Ben Siegel character which now probably dominates general perception. Warren Beatty gives Bugsy a measurable charm and a degree of intellectual flair which may not necessarily comply with the portrayal of his person of the times.Known as being well acquainted with Hollywood circles he was also described as being ruthless and apt for aggressive compulsive behaviours. Certain such aspects do feature in the opening sequences but increasingly into the picture Bugsy is shown as calm collected and focused on his public image. Fatefully he is also drawn as a sort of mafia dreamer whose vision far exceeded that of other mafioso of the time thus being key behind the overbudgeted exuberance of building The Flamingo thus becoming the basis for creating the economic power that is Las Vegas. At the time however his input was ridiculed ultimately leading to his death due to overspending of mafia money albeit truth be told the role of William Wilkerson is absolutely ignored giving Bugsy the sole credit for building Las Vegas.Warren Beatty also offers his strong presence to further romanticise Bugsy Siegel mostly through to his dedicated love affair with minor actress Virginia Hill Annette Bening. With some historic liberties in place Bugsy is shown as a somewhat obsessed and headoverheels blind lover who falls over for the wrong girl thus bringing about his downfall. This almost idyllic portrayal of one of America's most ruthless criminals would have to be its biggest flaw thus creating a image well in tune with the American dream but much detached from the bloody and dirty details behind mafia. Overall a pretty darn good film but somewhat discredited by overly idolising and overstating Ben Siegel as a hopeless dreamer and sole mastermind behind Las Vegas.".

Overall a pretty darn good film but somewhat discredited by overly idolising and overstating Ben Siegel as a hopeless dreamer and sole mastermind behind Las Vegas.";

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is a treat for all senses in all ways. The whole look to the finest details is perfect and reminds us of the Golden Hollywood Era. The ensemble cast for the most part more later is mind blowing. The music the pacing. Like most semibiographical storiesmovies it is not perfect in its accuracy. It IS however perfect in its execution. To even think of criticizing Beatty in his part as Ben Bugsy Siegel smells of having a personal dislike of the man. Beatty looking better than in his earlier movies Ishtar and Dick Tracy blows the audience away with his energetic overpowering maniacal charming intimidating scaring portrayal of Siegel. Whether the real Bugsy's character was portrayed we don't know. But the way he is portrayed in this movie by Beatty under fantastic direction of Barry Levinson he was one unpredictable scary but charming psychopath of a guy. Beatty pulls out all the stops giving one of his careers finest performances. In this part he proves for the so manieth time that he is indeed a wonderful talented and most of all terribly underrated actor. Kingsley Sarafian of course Keitel are solid and impressive in their parts. The ones in the cast who fall short in my opinion are the obviously miscast Joe Mantegna as George Raft if he wouldn't be called by that name in the movie one would never guess who he's supposed to be and  perhaps surprisingly to most reviewers  the future Mrs. Beatty Annette Bening as Virginia Hill. She has the look of the era down but her acting in this movie is too reminiscent of the cartoon character Jessica Rabbit slow sensual walk included. The movie concentrates on the developing obsessions of Siegel for a Virginia Hill and b his plan to develop a legal income heaven for the mob in Las Vegas. When Siegel  in this movie  wants something it's going to happen no matter what the cost. So his obsession with Hill costs him his family and his obsession to create Las Vegas ultimately costs him his life. The roller coaster ride that shows us how this all happens is this never dull movie of Levinson. The script for the movie took writer James Toback 6 years to complete after having received the story pitch from producer Beatty. But the end result explains why it took so long. PERFECTION. A real must see for everybody who wants to be on the edge of their chair for the entire duration of a movie to witness excellent acting beautiful decors hear fantastic music i.e. be thoroughly entertained THIS is the movie to see.".

	schema:reviewBody "Well this movie just ain't no Goodfellas even though it was definitely inspired by it. It's a pretty good movie on its own right but it just remains a bit too much on the safe and clean side to really regard this as a true great and effective gangstermovie.For a gangster movie it's just a too friendly one. This is like the light version of Goodfellas. Supposedly Bugsy Siegel was a big gangster boss with connections but when watching this movie it makes you wonder why and how all. Guess they were just too afraid we would begin to dislike the character once we saw him do a lot of brutal things and killing and giving orders to kill lots of people even though this all of course was more closer to the truth as the character that is being portrayed in this movie. This not just goes for the main character but also does around him. It especially also goes for Virginia Hill. Guess director Barry Levinson just wasn't the right guy for a movie such as this. So as a biopic of the real life gangster Ben 'Bugsy' Siegel this just isn't a really good or insightful movie.The movie still became an acclaimed success though mainly because gangster movies were popular at that time which also explains why the movie received no less than 10 Oscar nominations and taking home 2 of them. It was made at the same time as movies such as The Godfather Part III and Goodfellas got released.As a movie itself there isn't really much wrong with it. It's a good movie that follows a person that is following his dreams. Bugsy definitely seemed like a complicated and unpredictable character. He had some strange big ideas and really didn't knew how to handle money. It's a good movie and story on its own but as I said before as a biopic or gangster movie it can't be really seen as a great one. The movie basically suffers from the same problems as The Aviator it's too much in love with its main character and forgets to show the ugly but realistic things about his life.Also seemed to me that Warren Beatty also didn't really knew how to handle the character. At times he's portraying him as a tough gangster while at other moments it picks an even sort of like comical approach. Otherwise he plays well in the movie just because he's such a darn fine actor who has always starred in far to few pictures. His last movie already dates back again to 2001.This is also known as the movie in which Warren Beatty and Annette Bening met and they got married 1 year later.Besides Bening and Beatty the movie also stars acclaimed stars such as Harvey Keitel Ben Kingsley and Elliott Gould in variating sizes of roles. It's of course never a punishment to watch any of these actors in any movies.It's a good movie as long as you're not expecting a Goodfellas type of gangsterflick even though it features basically the same style and narrative way of storytelling.710httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

I'm not and never have been a Beatty fan but if the man had to win an Oscar for anything I'd say give it to him for BUGSY the nickname Benjamin Siegel hated anyone to use.How true all the details are I don't know. I'll have to do a background check on Bugsy when I finish this review but the movie is filled with what appears to be accurate period detail throughout with some great sets and art direction. Ironically it only received a couple of honors in the technical categories although honored with many nominations.ANNETTE BENING matches Beatty every step of the way with a mesmerizing performance as Virginia Hill the woman he has a huge obsession for. The jealousy angle is played up with some vivid scenes between Beatty and Bening that director Barry Levinson controls with just the right amount of passion.BEN KINGSLEY ELLIOT GOULD quite effective in an overlooked role as an illfated dumb gangster and HARVEY KEITEL all stand out in solid supporting roles. So does JOE MANTEGNA as George Raft playing his role with smooth style reminiscent of Raftand in one of the film's more interesting moments seen doing a scene from Manpower with an actress impersonating Marlene Dietrich.The use of '40s background music Accentuate the Positive and many others is especially well handled and sets the mood for a number of montages and glimpses of the Las Vegas scene during that period. Whether or not Beatty got his inspiration for building a gambling casino in the middle of the desert is accurate or not the story is a gripping one taking unexpected twists and turns as it moves toward its grim conclusion.Summing up Overtaken at the Oscars by Silence of the Lambs it's a film well worth seeking out if you missed it the first time as I did.".

Nothing is being manufactured at all any more and society has broken down into primitive localized communities. In 1966 a great plague wipes out most of what people are left but small numbers still survive. One day a strange aircraft lands at one of these communities and its pilot tells of an organization which is rebuilding civilization and slowly moving across the world recivilizing these groups of survivors. Great reconstruction takes place over the next few decades and society is once again great and strong. The world's population is now living in underground cities.

	schema:reviewBody "Powerful yet creaky science fiction film from the 30's by the Korda clan. H. G. Wells's work is brought to the screen as a vision of what warfare will bring mankind in the century to follow.  The film shows the destructive nature of war and how is will catapult us back to a state of barbarism warlords and another Black Deathlike plague called the wandering Sickness.  However because man clings to science man will rise above all this and create a new modern society free of warfare.  The film has a lot of historical inaccuracies to its discredit NOW yet much of what is preaches is plausible sometime and much of it has some truth to it in some form.  The theme that man can prevail and keep discoveringconquering new vistas is a laudable one.  The film shows that progress and science are the things which advance us as a people.  I thought of Ayn Rand and Atlas Shrugged as I heard one of the characters say something to the effect that the scientistsinventors had formed their own civilization free of corruption and violence.  The pace of the film is somewhat tortoiselike at times yet many scenes are very compelling.  The set designs are outstanding in the futuristic world of 2036where they valiantly try to put a rocket in space to make a preliminary orbit around the moon.  Acting is good with Raymond Massey and Cedric Hardwicke giving good performances but it is Ralph Richardson as a Boss who deserves the most praise for giving a powerful performance of a man with inherent human traits that stymie progress.  A thoughprovoking film indeed!".

	schema:reviewBody "This early scifi masterwork by Herbert George Wells with music by Arthur Bliss is a powerful piece of filmmaking. Adapted from Wells' somewhat different work by the author it presents a look at the human future with the subject of periods of war as versus periods of 'peace'. The structure is that after a contrastedpair of episodes of normalcy and gathering clouds of war the script allows the war to happen. Two families the Cabells and the Passworthys disagree about what may happen Passworthy takes a hopeful view of civilization's automatic progress Cabell is the thinker the doubter. Their city Everytownobviously London becomes wrecked by a war featuring tanks a magnificent war march by Bliss and the end of civilization. The second portion finds people living in the wreckage of what had been the city under a Boss played with bravura by Ralph Richardson whose woman lovely Margaretta Scott is as fascinating a dreamer as he is a concretebound dictator type. He is trying to rebuild old WWI airplanes so he can attack a nearby hill tribe to complete his petty kingdom a young scientist complains about having his work continually interrupted demands for planesetc.everlastingly this is Wells' comment on war versus progress. The survivors are subject to a plague called The Wandering Sickness also. Enter a modern flying machine piloted by the Cabell of the first section of the film now part of Wings Over the World an International Scientists' Coalition who are planning to end warfare forever. This flightsuited modernist has fascinating conversations with the Boss and his woman their attraction being evident then Boss sends up his aircraft against them the Scientists come with huge numbers of planes and drop the Gas of Peace onto the ruins of Everytown. Only the Boss dies fighting too hard against the pacifying. The film then shows ore being mined and by slow steps being made into the girders of a magnificent new futuristic city of towers. In section three a future Cabell argues with a future Passworthy over the morality of human science. Passworthy wonders if they have a right to send men to the Moon Cabell champions man's right to advancement and the need to expand his horizons. The son of Passworthy and Cabell's daughter are the astronauts being sent. Theotocopulos a religiousminded Luddite makes a fiery speech on a huge screen in the city's Forum and leads an attack on the 'space gun' that is to fire the new rocket free of Earth's gravity. The climax of the plot is the firing of the space gun successfully the denouement and ending is a speech by Cabell praising worth and science that is universally considered to be the most profound defense of the mind ever penned. It is all the universeor nothing! Cabell tells Passworthy. Which shall it be? As Cabell Raymond Massey gives perhaps his greatest screen performance he is thoughtful compassionate and reasonable a true scientist. As the rabblerouser who wants to end the Age of Science Cedric Hardwicke is perfect and powerful. Edward Chapman playing Passworthy does admirably impersonating the voice of convention and fear. The storyline is logical frequently beautiful and always interesting. Given the nearextinction of mankind the idea of a civilization run by rebuilder scientists is rendered plausible and credible to the viewer. This is a triumph for the director William Cameron Menzies for Bliss and for all concerned. Listen to the dialogue with someone you love within its constructed limits this is a thinking man's drama debating two possible human futuresprogress or its reactionary opposite.".

Jules Verne has some claim to be the father of science fiction but his stories were more adventure stories using marvellous inventions as plot devices . Wells was profound and brought subtext to his tales . Perhaps his greatest legacy is that there's very little if any evidence that people believed in life on other planets before the 20th century where as now many people including Richard Dawkins consider it a near certainty . There's no evidence of this of course and one can't help wondering that is was Wells who introduced this to human thinking ? Undoubtedly it was Wells that planted the seed .THINGS TO COME was adapted by Wells himself from his own novel . It is rather obvious however that he is unable to tell the difference between the technicalities of writing novels and writing screenplays . The dialouge is often laden  heavy handed and unconvincing . One case in point is the two pilots from opposing sides discussing the nature of war  Why must we murder one another . Why ?  This mirrors the criticism  near naked contempt that Orwell had of Wells in his essay Wells  Hitler And The World State and it is true that Wells antiwar message is painfully overstated . It'd be impossible to believe a conversation taking place between an RAF pilot and his opposite number in the Luftwaffe a few years later That said it is absolutely fascinating watching a film from 1935 predicting a world wide war taking place in 1940 that heralds the end of civilisation . There's a striking and haunting imagery as a child bangs a drum as a phantom army marches in the background and the collapse of society and the fear of The Wanderng Sickness is wonderfully realised . Even the rather lazy storytelling of showing the year of the setting has a compelling nature It's the images that makes this film along with Arthur Bliss score that makes the film so memorable . And to be fair Wells does ask the question  The universe or nothing . What shall it be ?  . In short this is a film whose flaws are easy to forgive".

Second for its time the special effects were absolutely incredibleusing matte paintings models and huge casts to create amazing scenes of both a postapocalyptic world and a vast city of tomorrow. Sure you could sit back and knock the film because by today's standards the effects are only soso. But you must appreciate that this was state of the art when the film came out in 1936 and it must have really amazed audiences. In many ways the sets look highly reminiscent of the modern cities featured at the 1939 WORLD'S FAIR.I think the movie is also interesting because it seems torn by the question are people really THAT stupid or are we destined for greatness? The end result seems to be a little of both! How true!A final note I saw this twice on TV and just a short time ago on video. All three times the sound and print quality stankparticularly the sound. If this is available on a DVD hopefully it is a lot cleaner and will provide optional captioning. As the sound on the video kept cutting out I really would have appreciated this!".

	schema:reviewBody "The first 2 parts seek to reduce to absurdity the rise of wasteful wars and rule by nationalist barbarians. The 3rd part speculates that progress and exploration toward the moon and beyond is the key to ensuring a meaningful use of human talents and resources. It has speeches that some viewers dismiss as naive or bombastic but that make others tingle with excitement. It depicts a space gunlauncher and a helicopter along with inventive mass communication devices elevators flat screen panels and wireless intercoms.

The first part of the film when war comes to Everytown is short but powerful. Ironically film audiences in its release year laughed at reports that enemy planes were attacking Englandappeasement was at its height. Wells' prediction was borne out all too soon. The montage of endless war that follows while marred by subpar model work is most effective. The explanatory titles are strongly reminiscent of German Expressionist graphic design. The art director was the great William Cameron Menzies and his sets of the ruins of Everytown are among his best work. Margaretta Scott is very seductive as the Chief's mistress. The Everytown of the 21st century is an equally striking design. The acting in the 21st century story is not compellingperhaps this was a misfired attempt to contrast the technocratic rationality of this time with the barbarism of 1970. Unfortunately the model work representing angry crowds rushing down elevated walkways is laughably bad and could have been done much better even with 30s technology. This is particularly galling since the scenes of the giant aircraft are very convincing. This is redeemed by Raymond Massey's magnificent speech that concludes the filmrarely has the ideal of scientific progress been expressed so well. Massey's final question is more relevant now than ever in an era of severely curtailed manned spaceflight. The scene is aided by the stirring music of Sir Arthur Bliss whose last name I proudly share.Unfortunately the VHS versions of this film are absolutely horrible with serious technical problems. Most versions have edited out a rather interesting montage of futuristic workers and machines that takes us from 1970 to 2038. I hope a good DVD exists of the entire film.".

	schema:headline " Didn't work for me but I'm obviously in the minority";
	schema:reviewBody "Obviously I didn't care for Things to Come aka The Shape of Things to Come as much as most viewers. That means that there is a good chance that you'll enjoy it more than I did. At any rate you might find it useful to hear the film described from another point of view.Directed by William Cameron Menzies who had as much experience as a production designer and even more as an art director this is a film adaptation by H.G. Wells of his own novel by the same name. In my eyes it helps demonstrate why a great novelist may not necessarily turn out to be a great screenwriter.The film opens in 1940 in a Londonlike Everytown. War is brewing and the citizens of Everytown are worried that it might reach them. It does. And it turns into a decadeslong affair that basically destroys civilization. Wells and Menzies keep jumping forward in time to show us different scenes related to the war and its aftermath. We see two pilots one downed coming to terms with the consequences of their fighting. We meet a postapocalyptic community ruled over by a wouldbe warlord. We meet a man from a burgeoning futuristic society. We see the way that technology is changing. And finally we're taken to the full realization of that futuristic society circa 2036 where the leaders are debating the merits of sending man to the moon.That might all sound potentially very exciting but it just does not work as a film. Structurally the film is far too episodic with little to dramatically tie it together. By the third segment I completely lost interest in trying to keep track of the characters. I had barely been able to sort them out in the first couple segments. There's a constant parade of new faces. We don't get to learn anything about any of them.It doesn't help that the individual segments with a couple exceptions tend to be awkwardly directed and edited. They are also occasionally manipulativeit can almost begin to feel like a propaganda film. But maybe contradictorily the segments are also a bit cold and dry emotionally.In fact one overlong section is more like a music videoindustrial promotional video. If features shots of building the futuristic city with lots of large machinery lots of welding and so on. At one point a guy who looks like an astronaut waves at the camera through some kind of futuristic glass. The music for this section is somewhere between militaristic and an overblown horror score. I can't say that Things to Come consists of engaging material in terms of drama.But the common cry in support of Things to Come is that it is a film about ideas. That may be true but there are a couple problems with it if looked at that way. One it still doesn't make it work as a film that is as a visual and aural dramatic artwork and two there are far too many ideas presented here.The principle idea is that of war and what it does to civilizations. That's a fine thing to make a film about. It's also remarkably prescient of World War II as the Things To Come was scripted and filmed in 1935 released in 1936. Wells has some interesting things to say about war some of which go against the usual interpretation of the film. For example the ending seems to suggest that another war is breaking out or will at any moment. The overall message seems a trifle pessimistic. Wells seems to be showing that war is simply a part of human nature that cannot be excised although it doesn't preclude progressin fact maybe it fuels progress at least indirectly.That would certainly be enough for one film. However there are many more ideas here. The scene between the two pilots is one of the more poignant scenes of the film. It deals with a complex dilemma. One pilot has shot the other down but is now coming to assist him. But the pilot who was shot down was carrying a poisonous gas that is now billowing across the field. They can't both breathe the gas without harm. A girl comes along. They only have two functioning gasmasks between them. The pilot who was shot down offers his mask as he says he's dying anyway. What to do? It's not that this scene itself could be stretched out to feature length but the ideasthe bizarre complex of both helping and trying to hurt each other in the midst of a warare enough to build a film on.Another example. During the scenes featuring the wouldbe warlord in the postapocalyptic environment there is a nasty contagious disease called the wandering sickness going around. It turns victims into something like drunken zombies. The usual procedure is to shoot victims on site in an attempt to stave off the disease. This material is dealt with as if it were an afterthought. It's a great idea and deserved its own film.Similarly Wells presents the future society as having controversial socialist ideas. That was enough for its own film too. It's just impossible to effectively deal with so much stuff in 100 minutes especially when it's supposed to be the crux of the film in lieu of dramatic attraction.Still there are reasons to give Things to Come at least one viewing. If you're at all a scifi buff this is a historically important film. Given Menzies' background the production and set designs are interesting even if the cinematography seems extremely dated. It's also interesting to see how Wells was either prescient or retrospectively humorous in his predictions. I particularly enjoyed the means of propulsion to the moon which was strongly reminiscent of George Mlis' 1902 A Trip to the Moon aka Le Voyage dans la lune.

	onyx:emotionText "Obviously I didn't care for Things to Come aka The Shape of Things to Come as much as most viewers. That means that there is a good chance that you'll enjoy it more than I did. At any rate you might find it useful to hear the film described from another point of view.Directed by William Cameron Menzies who had as much experience as a production designer and even more as an art director this is a film adaptation by H.G. Wells of his own novel by the same name. In my eyes it helps demonstrate why a great novelist may not necessarily turn out to be a great screenwriter.The film opens in 1940 in a Londonlike Everytown. War is brewing and the citizens of Everytown are worried that it might reach them. It does. And it turns into a decadeslong affair that basically destroys civilization. Wells and Menzies keep jumping forward in time to show us different scenes related to the war and its aftermath. We see two pilots one downed coming to terms with the consequences of their fighting. We meet a postapocalyptic community ruled over by a wouldbe warlord. We meet a man from a burgeoning futuristic society. We see the way that technology is changing. And finally we're taken to the full realization of that futuristic society circa 2036 where the leaders are debating the merits of sending man to the moon.That might all sound potentially very exciting but it just does not work as a film. Structurally the film is far too episodic with little to dramatically tie it together. By the third segment I completely lost interest in trying to keep track of the characters. I had barely been able to sort them out in the first couple segments. There's a constant parade of new faces. We don't get to learn anything about any of them.It doesn't help that the individual segments with a couple exceptions tend to be awkwardly directed and edited. They are also occasionally manipulativeit can almost begin to feel like a propaganda film. But maybe contradictorily the segments are also a bit cold and dry emotionally.In fact one overlong section is more like a music videoindustrial promotional video. If features shots of building the futuristic city with lots of large machinery lots of welding and so on. At one point a guy who looks like an astronaut waves at the camera through some kind of futuristic glass. The music for this section is somewhere between militaristic and an overblown horror score. I can't say that Things to Come consists of engaging material in terms of drama.But the common cry in support of Things to Come is that it is a film about ideas. That may be true but there are a couple problems with it if looked at that way. One it still doesn't make it work as a film that is as a visual and aural dramatic artwork and two there are far too many ideas presented here.The principle idea is that of war and what it does to civilizations. That's a fine thing to make a film about. It's also remarkably prescient of World War II as the Things To Come was scripted and filmed in 1935 released in 1936. Wells has some interesting things to say about war some of which go against the usual interpretation of the film. For example the ending seems to suggest that another war is breaking out or will at any moment. The overall message seems a trifle pessimistic. Wells seems to be showing that war is simply a part of human nature that cannot be excised although it doesn't preclude progressin fact maybe it fuels progress at least indirectly.That would certainly be enough for one film. However there are many more ideas here. The scene between the two pilots is one of the more poignant scenes of the film. It deals with a complex dilemma. One pilot has shot the other down but is now coming to assist him. But the pilot who was shot down was carrying a poisonous gas that is now billowing across the field.

	schema:reviewBody "I must admit a slight disappointment with this film I had read a lot about how spectacular it was yet the actual futuristic sequences the Age of Science take up a very small amount of the film. The sets and are excellent when we get to them and there are some startling images but this final sequence is lacking in too many other regards...Much the best drama of the piece is in the midsection and then it plays as melodrama arising from the 'high concept' sciencefiction nature of it all and insufficiently robust dialogue. There is far more human life in this part though with the great Ralph Richardson sailing gloriously overthetop as the small dictator the Boss of the Everytown. I loved Richardson's mannerisms and curt delivery of lines dismissing the presence and ideas of Raymond Massey's aloof confident visitor. This Boss is a posturing convincingly deluded figure unable to realise the smallfry nature of his kingdom... It's not a great role yet Richardson makes a lot of it.Everytown itself is presumably meant to be England or at least an English town fairly representative of England. Interesting was the complete avoidance of any religious side to things the 'things to come' seem to revolve around a conflict between warlike barbarism and a a faith in science that seems to have little ultimate goal but to just go on and on. There is a belated attempt to raise some arguments and tensions in the last section concerning more personal 'life' yet one is left quite unsatisfied. The film hasn't got much interest in subtle complexities it goes for barnstorming spectacle and unsubtle blunt moralism every time. And of course recall the hedgedbet finale Raymond Massey waxing lyrical about how uncertain things are! Concerning the question of the film being a prediction I must say it's not at all bad as such considering that one obviously allows that it is impossible to gets the details of life anything like right. The grander conceptions have something to them a war in 1940 well that was perhaps predictable... Lasting nearly 30 years mind!? A nuclear bomb  the super gun or some such contraption  in 2036... A technocratic socialist we don't believe in independent nation statestype government in Britain after 1970... Hmmm sadly nowhere near on that one chaps!  No real politics are gone into here which is a shame all that surfaces is a very laudable antiwar sentiment. Generally it is assumed that dictatorship  whether boneheadedludditefascist as under the Boss or allhandstothepump scientific socialism  will be the deal and these implications are not broached... While we must remember that in 1936 there was no knowledge at all of how Nazism and Communism would turn out  or even how they were turning out  the lack of consideration of this seems meek beside the scope of the filmmakers' vision on other matters.Much of the earlier stuff should  and could  have been cut in my opinion only the briefest stuff from '1940' would have been necessary yet this segment tends to get rather ponderous and it is ages before we get to the RichardsonMassey parts. I would have liked to have seen more done with Margareta Scott who is just a trifle sceptical cutting a flashingeyed Mediterranean figure to negligible purpose. The character is not explored or frankly explained or exploited except for one scene which I shall not spoil and her relationship with the Boss isn't explored but then this was the 1930s and there was such a thing as widespread institutional censorship back then. Edward Chapman is mildly amusing in his two roles more so in the first as a hapless chap praying for war only to be bluntly put down by another Massey character. Massey himself helps things a lot playing his parts with a mixture of restraint and sombre gusto contrasting well with a largely diffident cast save for Richardson and Scott and Chapman slightly.I would say that Things to Come is undoubtedly a very extraordinary film to have been made in Britain in 1936 one of the few serious British science fiction films to date indeed! Its set piece design and harnessing of resources are ravenous marvellous. Yet the script is ultimately overearnest and at times all over the place. The direction is prone to a flatness though it does step up a scenic gear or two upon occasion. The cinematographer and Mr Richardson really do salvage things however respectively creating an awed sense of wonder at technology and an engaging jerky performance that consistently beguiles. Such a shame there is so little substance or real filmic conception to the whole thing Powell and Pressburger would have been the perfect directors to take on such a task as this  they are without peer among British directors as daring visual storytellers great helmsmen of characters and dealers in dialogue of the first rate.Things to Come as it stands is an intriguing oddity well worth perusing yet far short of a Metropolis... 'Tis much as silly in Wells' words as that Lang film yet with nothing like the astonishing force of it.".

And we see it in the tea leaves with movies of the near future like Minority Report or AI or just for the fun of it Sleeper. Or Brazil. Or Twelve Monkeys.Yes it can go any number of ways and a writer and director can look to make things realistic enough to go with the fantasy or make things fantastic and the hell with realism. I'm not talking the distant future like Star Wars but the kind of future we might live to see you know Planet of the Apes. These kinds of movies are everywhere and they are a kind of thrill just for their vision of the future.Things to Come was made as Europe was teetering toward war but there was only the Spanish Civil War under way. The way it foresees a devastating world war is pretty amazing even now as long as you keep the dates straight. When it jumps after half an hour of some pretty terrific filming to 1970 it gets more fictional and we have a primitive future of devastation and a struggling rabble trying to survive and revive civilization. It's a common way to look at the unknownto revert to a primitive timeand it's fun and a little overwhelming if you take it seriously. The big theme of war and of a future society opposed to war is an old one but who can get tired of it?The first half hour is a wonder of Soviet Expressionist filming. I know this is a British movie very British except oddly the director Menzies but it looks like Eisenstein both filmed it and edited it and the effect is amazing. If you only have half an hour watch just this first part and don't worry too much about the plot. The remainder of the movie settles down and looks a little like either Intolerance yes 1916 stuff with big outdoor sets or Caligari German Expressionist interiors tamed down a bit. In a word this is an old fashioned movie in the best wayit's artsy and exuberant. And it's not forward looking for a movie about the future until it reaches the 21st Century and then it gets amazingly right the prevalence of imagery of transparent electronic images on screens large and small even if they are wearing Roman togas.H.G. Wells not only wrote the original novel but he wrote the screenplay which makes the movie significant through and through. It is sometimes ponderous and trying too hard to be idealistic amidst human instinct for violence and control. After a fabulous fabulous montage sequence to move us ahead another half century we continue the rather boring discussion talk about the future of the world and the value of civilization. It's amazing to look at but it's not an exciting thing to hear discussed. In short it lacks plot. Luckily it has a lot of other stuff to compensate.".

	schema:headline " A unique example of serious science fiction from the 1930s";
	schema:reviewBody "There is something particularly engaging about dated science fiction especially when it is describes a period that is already in the past. 1984 comes to mind as an example as well as the works of Jules Verne. Another instance of this phenomenon is the film version of H. G. Wells' Things to Come.  The first part of this film depicting the bombing of Everytown London at Christmas of 1940 is particularly chilling because that actually did happen keep in mind that this movie was released in 1936.  The other images of tank warfare and attacks by massive formations of bombers are also surprisingly close to the actual course of events during World War II. Only in the use of poison gas was Wells vision a little off but only slightly.  Both sides stockpiled gas and were prepared to use it but in the end neither side had the desire to be the first.The second part depicts the postapocalyptic world of 1970 dominated by a brutal warlord played by Ralph Richardson.  In many respects this particular Wellsian vision of the future appears remarkably similar to any number of recent postapocalyptic fantasy films such as the Mad Max movies or Kevin Kostner's Waterworld and The Postman.In the final sequence the world has been taken over by a sort of totalitarian technocracy.  This technocratic power structure is assailed by reactionary forces led by an artistdemagogue played by Cedric Hardwicke. Although this is the weakest portion of the film dramatically it is the most visually imaginative.  Among the wonders featured is a surprisingly modernlooking helicopter which is astonishing considering the fact that Igor Sikorsky did not fly the  first helicopter until four years after Things to Come' was produced!   The final scenario of a popular rebellion against technology and progress is not as farfetched as it might seem.  There are precedents for that sort of thinking even today.

There were very few serious examples of cinematic science fiction produced during the first half of the 20th century.  For that reason alone Things to Come' along with Metropolis' remains a mustsee for any true Science fiction fan.".

	onyx:emotionText "There is something particularly engaging about dated science fiction especially when it is describes a period that is already in the past. 1984 comes to mind as an example as well as the works of Jules Verne. Another instance of this phenomenon is the film version of H. G. Wells' Things to Come.  The first part of this film depicting the bombing of Everytown London at Christmas of 1940 is particularly chilling because that actually did happen keep in mind that this movie was released in 1936.  The other images of tank warfare and attacks by massive formations of bombers are also surprisingly close to the actual course of events during World War II. Only in the use of poison gas was Wells vision a little off but only slightly.  Both sides stockpiled gas and were prepared to use it but in the end neither side had the desire to be the first.The second part depicts the postapocalyptic world of 1970 dominated by a brutal warlord played by Ralph Richardson.  In many respects this particular Wellsian vision of the future appears remarkably similar to any number of recent postapocalyptic fantasy films such as the Mad Max movies or Kevin Kostner's Waterworld and The Postman.In the final sequence the world has been taken over by a sort of totalitarian technocracy.  This technocratic power structure is assailed by reactionary forces led by an artistdemagogue played by Cedric Hardwicke. Although this is the weakest portion of the film dramatically it is the most visually imaginative.  Among the wonders featured is a surprisingly modernlooking helicopter which is astonishing considering the fact that Igor Sikorsky did not fly the  first helicopter until four years after Things to Come' was produced!   The final scenario of a popular rebellion against technology and progress is not as farfetched as it might seem.  There are precedents for that sort of thinking even today.  The Luddite and Green movements come to mind and the infamous Unibomber is an extreme case in point.Things to Come' may seem dated in many ways but it's spectacular art deco' view of the future continues to enthrall.

Lang's film was dark and moody....this one was dark and dramatic. It also predicted World War 2 the space program and TV. In 1936!!!H.G. wanted to give us his version of the future. And also letting us know it wasn't coming easy. The war was met with a lot of 'gung ho' but the scenes of the bombing were very well made and hard to watch for the time. Keep your eye out for the tophatted man that shakes his fist at the bombers....right before he gets killed. And of course the dead child that just wanted to play soldier.Then comes the disease. Trying times for all. But when technology leaps forward....watch out. The FX here were great without a doubt. You get the idea that the crew took great pains to make it look good without overdoing it.Having the entire cast play multiple roles was a good idea too. Sir Cedric and Mr. Massey leading the way here. Scifi with drama makes a great film no?".

In reality intellectual cinema has been achieved more often in the decadent West's commercial movie business most notably by Kubrick in 2001 and 32 years earlier by Korda and HG Wells in Things to Come.Don't look to this flick for wellrounded characters a coherent AtoB storyline or naturalistic dialogue and body language. It's a grandiose thesis in images designed to pose Wells's constant question must Man drive himself on to explore his and Nature's potentialities at all costs or will he grow tired and afraid of transforming the world and his own nature?At the beginning we see the destructiveness of total war potentialities for harm even for collective suicide. Nations fight each other to the death the Wandering Sickness bounces civilisation back to a primitive subsistence and it requires a new breed of airborne technocrat to set progress rolling again. At the finish we see the revolt of the masses spurred by artists and abstract thinkers who fear progress they are out to smash the Space Gun before Man can launch his children into the frightening terra incognita of space.Along the way a devastating prophecy of World War Two all mass bomber raids and poison gas with tank blitzkriegs for good measure. It must have chilled the blood of the film's original spectators for the first bombs on Everytown demolish a cinema. Cameron Menzies shoots the raid in dynamic Russianmontage style with a brilliant use of sound the incoming bombers which will always get through buzz louder and louder like a swarm of hornets. After years of deepening chaos order is roughly restored by Ralph Richardson's Mussolinilike Boss who says Thirties films weren't allowed to do satire? before he is brushed aside by Raymond Massey's burningeyed supercilious Airman who seems more of a tyrant than Richardson. No democratic nonsense for Wings Over the World.The final sequence of Everytown in the future is an art deco poem in gleaming silver and grey which evokes the streamlining so in vogue between the wars. Wells's imagination does not stretch to jet propulsion and the helicopter spotted by one IMDB reviewer is more probably based on Ricardo De La Cierva's autogiro but other aspects of 1936's future such as the malllike internal public spaces full of plants and giant TV screens are spoton. In the long montage of rebuilding Everytown laser cutting technology and computers are implied the movie was released the year Alan Turing's famous paper on computable numbers was written.More than The Private Life of Henry VIII Things to Come stands for Korda's rescue job on the British sound film. For it went beyond anything Hollywood then preoccupied with Thalbergesque costume frolics and Warners' problem pictures could imagine.  London Films demonstrated that British skill in special effects could surpass America's while the score by Arthur Bliss was the first to be sold on disc.None of this necessarily matters to today's casual viewer and the occasionally creaky or fratefully refained bit of acting is bathetic but these flaws are easily forgiven against the grandeur of the conception and the abiding relevance of the final question sung into the starry night. Which Shall It Be? dangerous development or soothing stagnation? The choice is still ours.".

The concept of the future and the Korda an Co. concept of the the machines of the future are the real stars of the film. The very best acting performance is that of Ralph Richardson as the Boss. A combination of Winston Churchill and Edina from Absolutely Fabulous comedy series. It is interesting to note that the Boss's negative personality is somewhat similar to the war time Churchill.".

	schema:reviewBody "SYNOPSIS The future as seen from 1939 England. As war loomed over Europe the salvation of mankind will not be found in the politics of the past. It is up to the brave new world of science to overcome man's past mistakes.CONCEPT IN RELATION TO THE VIEWER Beware your leaders and what you are told. Thinking outside the box can lead to a brighter tomorrow. There will always be descent and fear and learning to overcome it is our only hope.PROS AND CONS I had seen this film long ago and recently downloaded it off of the internet it is in the public domain. This is a fascinating work on numerous levels. Since it is a story about the future as seen from 1939 it has obvious flaws. This vision of the future is both terrifying and whimsical. This film was cutting edge for its day. The special effects are very good as is the story line. The acting suffers a bit in the British theatrical sense in that it can lean a bit toward Shakespeare.One of the underlying themes of the film is that science and technology can solve all our problems which we now know is not always true. The films other plot line is that charismatic leaders are a curse of human existence and will probably always be with us.The underpinnings of almost all later science fiction movies can be seen in this film. The set design and wardrobe of Forbidden Planet the failings of technology in 2001 A Space Odessy even the lush landscapes  cityscapes of Star Wars owe some amount of inspiration to this film.The ending of the film leaves the viewer a bit perplexed. While it is optimistic in its ending sequence of reaching for the stars we are left to wonder if mankind will ever be able to make it. Even as we reach there are those that are trying to hold us back. This films vision of the future while interesting is also a bit humorous by todays standards. Huge flying machines and guns that could shoot people into space never materialized in the real world but in 1939 they were considered the next logical step.Many great British actors are in this film as young men. Cedric Hardwicke and Ralph Richardson are the most recognized and their oratory skills are evident here. Raymond Massey is a curious choice to play the lead character Cabel. His character almost comes across as the new Christ sent to save the world from its own destruction with the new religion of science.This is a good piece of cinema history whose themes are still relevant today even if its vision of the future missed the mark.".
