When you look at her there's so much there unlike most actresses whose faces do not say anything.  You can tell there is alot going on in her mind just by her face. The screenplay is intelligent and very funny and aside from a slow stretch or two I really liked the movie. It is not like Clueless or anything else which of course is a good thing. One of my favorite scenes is when Cliff and Torrance Kirsten Dunst are brushing their teeth.  Its probably a throwaway scene and there is no dialogue but it was really great for me at least.".

Bring It On which was a surprise hit in the fall of 2000 clearly believes that cheerleaders are far more  than hoofers gone to seed. Despite the frequent jokes at their expense in the film Bring It On shows cheerleaders are spirited athletic graceful and most importantly relevant to the 21st Century. Colorfully shot attractively cast and snappily written Bring It On is hardly a great movie but it's perfectly appealing for most people and I'd guess that the millions of cheerleaders and former cheerleaders nationwide will get a lot more out of it.The plot is simple. It's like Rocky. Or Varsity Blues. Or any other sports movie you've ever seen. New captain of the five time national cheerleading champions Toros Torrance Kirsten Dunst is shocked when the new girl on the squad Eliza Dushka a gymnast tells her that all of the routines that made the squad famous were stolen from an inner city school in East Compton two hours up the coast. Determined to prove that they can do it themselves the Toros go through a fairly short journey to selfempowerment. There's a pounding bass line lots of teens in short skirts some fun flipping and a lesson about being true to yourself and believing in others.The film also takes on any number of myths about cheerleaders. Are male cheerleaders all gay or do they just like grabbing girls' rears? The answer of course is a little from column A and a little from Column B. Are cheerleaders all airheads? Well the issue of whether or not these girls go to class is done away with in two minutes at the beginning of the film. From that point on education books and homework are never mentioned. Any occasional signs of intelligence are held up to ridicule though these sweater puppets are all quick with a witty retort so they must have something going on upstairs. And finally is cheerleading a sport? Well this film comes out firmly on the side of yes.For all of its verve Jessica Bendinger's script is too reductive for the movie to be taken very seriously. The white girls are obviously upper scale and spoiled. Naturally the white girls don't have any sass at first and naturally they borrow it from their AfricanAmerican neighbors. The black girls are supposed to be poor. Not that that's really depicted in this dayglo colored world.In fact through the wonders of Hollywood Central casting the squad from East Compton actually looked even more racially homogenous than the Buffys from San Diego. This is an inner city high school that has a cheerleading squad featuring a dozen girls with identical light complexions and straight hair. The racial assumptions at work here would be offensive if the movie placed any premium on reality. Instead as directed by Peyton Reed everything is colorful glossy and easy on the eyes. The intricate cheerleading routines are mostly shot from strange angles or awkward closeups to make it impossible to tell if the cast is actually doing any of the cheering stunts at all.When Kirsten Dunst makes good small movies see The Virgin Suicides or Dick nobody goes to them. So I suppose it's fitting that this movie was a smash. She's always an entertaining screen presence and for now she's still young enough that it isn't ridiculous for her to keep playing high school characters. How her career progresses as she matures remains to be seen. The rest of the cast seems like they were picked from the set of a WB series. Now since I kind of like a number of WB series I don't mean this as an insult in any way. The Warner Brothers network has proven a good training ground for attractive young women to read catchy dialogue and everybody in Bring It On seems very skilled with the zingers. And as the aforementioned Sparky the choreographer Ian Roberts is just hilarious and his scene is easily the funniest part of the movie.In the end Bring It On is fairly satisfying. It's also amusing to note the strange directions that this movie is able to stretch the limits of the PG13 rating in terms of language and certain forms of implied sexuality. But that's neither here nor there. Bring it On gets a nottobeashamedof 610 from me.".

I speak of course about cheerleaders and both 'Bring It On' and 'Sugar and Spice'. But while 'Sugar and Spice' was campy and surreal 'Bring It On' is a selfconsciously serious movie advancing the idea of the cheerleader as athlete. While this idea is an honest and accurate one it's one that audiences will only take so far. Cheerleaders may indeed be finer athletes than those on the sports teams they cheer for I'd believe it although I've never been a cheerleader and only rarely watch them on ESPN. I do know though that 'sissy girly' activities are very frequently more difficult than 'tough manly' activities but try telling the boys that or a movie audience. No matter how many bigbudget andor 'true story' movies are made wherein football is a metaphor for life or boxing is an affirmation of the greatness of the human spirit even the most fascinating stories about sports like gymnastics or figure skating are strictly television movieoftheweek fodder. In this atmosphere you cannot make a cheerleading movie serious. You have to make it a joke. The smart folks behind Bring It On though realized that if they could strike a certain balance they could fulfill expectations but also get their point across. So they filled their flick with cute peppy girls like Kirsten Dunst always a delight and wellcast here as a golden girl with a conscience and snappy irreverent jokes. They have a PG13 locker room scene and a bikini carwash. They also have broken bones and high stress very real factors in the lives of competitive cheerleaders. The squad is coed and we get to know two of these curious maligned creatures commonly known as male cheerleaders. One of them is gay and an extremely welladjusted likable and nonfaggy one at that. The other is straight and as horny as any frat boy in Animal House. We also have a tough girl named Missy transferring from L.A. along with her cute brother Cliff and the news that the Toro squad's cheers are not 100 original as they had believed. Unfortunately for Kirsten's character Torrance and her Rancho Carne Toros their excaptain stole all their prizewinning routines from an East Compton squad which are perhaps overly rude even given the circumstances that will be going to Nationals for the first time. So what's a cheerleading squad to do except experience various pratfalls on the way to coming up with their own routine and competing and learning something about valuing your own strengths? It's better than it sounds surprisingly and refreshingly enough. As for macho posturing at sports movies the fact that this was a sueprise hit and 'Sugar and Spice' was not might just be a sign that there are audiences too smart to believe that any movie about female athletes must automatically be completely silly. What a surprising and refreshing change.".

	schema:headline " Classic cheer for the best teen movie and an original film";
	schema:reviewBody "Bring It On 2000 is a underrated teen cheerleading movie with Kirsten Dunst and Eliza Dushku. It is my favorite high school teen comedy and I honestly don't care what anyone says about this film. A champion high school cheerleading squad discovers its previous captain stole all their best routines from an innercity school and must scramble to compete at this year's championships. I love this film. Torrance Shipman Kirsten Dunst was the most memorable and my favorite character from my all time favorite actress Kirsten Dunst. I went trough high school watching this film. I love sport comedy films like were Major League 1989 and I love this team sport comedy film. It was followed by four directtovideo sequels none of which contain any of the original cast members. Bring It on is original true the best cheerleading comedy in the film series. I love this film and I always will it is my favorite film of all time. At least it is much better than they are teen comedy this days. Jessica Bendinger wanted to mix cheerleading and hiphop the two tastes that taste great together it's like peanut butter and chocolate which she did. The choreography very beautiful the dance moves were pretty good and amazing. Long before Pitch Perfect became a hit franchise and every group of women became our squadgoals there were the Toros and the Clovers. Fifteen years ago this month Universal released Bring It On into theaters a low budget highschool comedy about rival cheerleading teams that spawned four spin off films a stage musical and helped pave the way for the Barden Bellas the McKinley glee club and many more The plot of the film centers on Torrance Shipman Kirsten Dunst who inherits the position of captain on her high school's cheerleading squad and attempts to lead her team to a sixth national title. However Torrance is informed by the newest team member Missy Pantone Eliza Dushku that she is in possession of a stolen routine. When the originators of the work vow to win Torrance and her squad must go to different lengths in order to create an original performance.The Toro cheerleading squad has spirit spunk sass and a killer routine that's sure to land them the national championship trophy for the sixth year in a row. But for newlyelected team captain Torrance Kirsten Dunst the Toro's road to cheer glory stumbles when she discovers their perfectly choreographed routines were stolen from a hot hiphop squad across town. Now the squad must scramble to find a new routine to compete in this year's competition.I love this movie and I am not saying that as a blonde or a cheerleader! No offense   This is the best Bring It On movie out of all of them. Kirsten Dunst in an amazing actress. This movie is funny very cute and the original Bring It On! At Rancho Carne High School cheerleading is everything to student Torrance Kirsten Dunst who aching to be named head cheerleader of school squad the Toros continuing the aggressive pursuit of dominance started by graduating member Big Red Lindsay Slone. Requiring a new cheerleader to help fill a gap caused by an accident the squad welcomes Missy Eliza Dushku to the team though the new student isn't sure her cynical ways are a good fit while her brother Cliff Jesse Bradford welcomes the assimilation attracted to Torrance and her indefatigable spirit. When she realizes routines established by Big Red are actually stolen from the East Compton Clovers led by icy Isis Gabrielle Union Torrance loses confidence requiring support from the splintered Toros and outside influences as she attempts to rebuild what was lost. Director Peyton Reed and screenwriter Jessica Bendinger who tried to reheat her formula for 2006's Stick It favor bigness when it comes to the antics contained in Bring It On. Summoning blinding cheerleading spirit the production turns the quest for trophies into a cartoon complete with aggressive closeups and screamed line readings while the writing retains fingersnap timing and an interest in developing its own vocabulary e.g. Torrance demanding that the Toros are not a cheerocracy always on the go in terms of characterization and plotting a midmovie detour with the Toros and a professional choreographer harboring an obsession with spirit fingers is amusing. The rating I am giving is 1010 for been Entertained sport film. The film isn't perfect it has flaws. The Toros cheerleading squad should have win on the end of the film and they didn't. That move hurt the film. In all the sequels all cheerleading squad team won in this film they didn't. The film is good because of Kirsten Dunst. Believe it or not it's been 15 years since everyone's favorite campy cheerleader movie Bring It On debuted. Kirsten Dunst aka captain Torrance Shipman appeared on The Late Late Show With James Corden last night and talked about her first major lead role. None of us knew it would become a hit she says. We were just a couple of young people in San Diego making a Universal film no one cared about.1010 Grade A Studio Beacon Communications Starring Kirsten Dunst Eliza Dushku Jesse Bradford Gabrielle Union Clare Kramer Director Peyton Reed Producers Marc Abraham Thomas Bliss Screenplay Jessica Bendinger Rated PG13 Running Time 1 Hr. 38 Mins. Budget 10.000.000 Box Office 68379000".

So many of the positive reviews I have seen prior to this one have had to make disclaimers e.g. yes it was childish... but I will not do so. I am going to be confident in the intelligence of anyone reading this to understand that the quality of a film always has to be taken in the context it was meant to be viewed in. Bring It On is an excellent farce making fun of The Stereotypical Cheerleader. At the same time the characters were very real well played and easy to empathize with. The movement dance? was lots of fun to watch. I also felt that the characters were much more realistic than many teenage characters are usually portrayed in film  more sarcastic and intelligently witty and sexual than usual. I think this is good because many films give the impression that all teenagers are naive and childish when in fact this is not necessarily the case. I must admit though that I couldn't help thinking that certain things had to happen the way they did for the sake of Political Correctness and that is disappointing but from the filmmakers perspective understandable. It was good to see a little bit of gayfriendliness in the film which is rare to find in any films.Overall I thought it was a lot of fun and I left the film feeling good!".

Given a genuinely exciting reinvention by 'Clueless' and reaching a peak with the likes of 'American Pie' and '10 Things I hate about you' the genre is in danger as all successful genres are of exchanging its wit visual exuberance engaging playing and agreeable sentiment for cashhungry formulae and allround laziness.  'Bring it on' falls into neither of these traps but is aware that its genre is exhausting itself and raises a number of pertinent issues.  do filmmakers like the Toro cheerleaders continue their success by ripping off others' tricks?  Is it possible to be original any more or is the best we can hope for a clever spin on older wider sources this of course applies to cinema and all art in general?  Most pertinent and 'Road Block' had already touched on this is it time we jettisoned the toothy white middleclass young and their ohsoharrowing traumas and allow a more representative teen demographic into the tacitly racist genre? 'Bring it on' may not entirely escape this last accusation  the black cheerleaders have no real humanity of their own we are not given the same insight into their backgrounds and personalities as the white girls beyond catchall underprivilege.  They are a mirror in which the whites can examine their complacency or flaws and correct them  literally so in many scenes where the whites 'reflect' the blacks' movements and the latter distort them in return thereby commenting on them.  However this touchy racial subject matter has a major benefit on the narrative arc.  The plot is the old standby a team of underdogs against the odds triumph against circumstances and expectations.  This would be tiresomely formulaic except there are two teams in the film with equal claims on our attention and sympathies  it would be unthinkable for a Hollywood film today to have poor black people lose against pampered whites but every stylistic decision  the humanising of characters the rites of passage and socialisingofmisfits narrative screentime etc.  favours these whites.  This creates a genuine tension added to little asides such as Torrence's brother's Tshirt 'Cheerleading  Death' that make a familiar narrative interesting problematic and unpredictable. This is not to deny the familiar pleasures of the genre  the beautiful clothesshy young stars the film gets to leer and satirise such leering! the witty dialogue and bitchiness the screenplay sharp about traditional issues of power and community revelatory stylised dreams and memories the unforced energy.  'Bring it on' is a rare instance in the last few decades of a musical and the various cheerleading routines are exhilerating and inventive revealing to many a hitherto hidden purpose of a much maligned group while still retaining the right to tonguehollow that cheek.  AND a Shakespearean finale where the actors come back after the curtain and show us it was all play.".

She discovers that the cheers and routines for the last several years have been stolen from another school's squad. Torrance relies on a reluctant gymnast named MissyEliza Dushkuto convince the cheer team to learn new material to take to the next state competition. What a shame it is that the football team is so awful that the schools pride is in the cheerleaders. This is an interesting eyeful but actually just another vehicle for the enticing Miss Dunst.Fine support fromPua Kapiolani Tsianina Joelson Clare Kramer and Nicole Bilderback. If you have a cheerleader fetish you will think this romp deserves an Oscar. Nonetheless enjoyable.".

	onyx:emotionText "Torrance ShipmanKirsten Dunstbecomes the new captain of the high school cheer leading team that takes pride in winning competition championships year after year. She discovers that the cheers and routines for the last several years have been stolen from another school's squad. Torrance relies on a reluctant gymnast named MissyEliza Dushkuto convince the cheer team to learn new material to take to the next state competition. What a shame it is that the football team is so awful that the schools pride is in the cheerleaders. This is an interesting eyeful but actually just another vehicle for the enticing Miss Dunst.Fine support fromPua Kapiolani Tsianina Joelson Clare Kramer and Nicole Bilderback. If you have a cheerleader fetish you will think this romp deserves an Oscar. Nonetheless enjoyable.";

They really made the film what it was and they were all perfect for the part.My only criticism is that there was little need for the character of Cliff Played by Jesse Bradford. It took the movie away from it's main point of cheerleading. Though I liked the tension between him and Dunst it wasn't really needed.I never got a chance to see the sequel but I'm sure that it isn't better than the original.".

	schema:reviewBody "I actually only went to see it since it appeared at the time it would be the number one movie in the country. But much to my surprise it wasn't all that bad. Cheesy? Yes. Bad dialogue? Absolutely. Fun? I thought it was. It didn't take itself so seriously that it was horrible and it took itself seriously enough that it was fun watching these kids cheerlead their little hearts out.The plot... well the 5 time national champion cheerleaders from Rancho Carne High School in San Diego they're the Toros find out that all their award winning cheers were actually stolen from the cheerleaders at East Compton High they're the Clovers. So now if they want to keep their championship dreams alive they need to come together as a team and create their own original cheer and cheer like they've never cheered before. Lead by their captain Torrance Shipman Kirsten Dunst the Toros make it back to the national championships and go head to head with the Clovers to see who really is the best darn cheerleaders in the country. Yes the plot is cheesy but I think that was going to be a very obvious thing from the beginning. The movie is about cheerleading after all. Not that I have anything against cheerleaders but a movie that centers around the trials and tribulations of cheerleaders is not going to have a serious and deep story. The dialogue was appropriately bad and yes cheesy enough to make you wish that it were serious and deep. However when you have the bright peppy and beautiful Dunst in the lead how can you not smile and cheer right along with all of them?Also along for the ride one of my personal favorite actresses the notyetbutsoontobepopular Eliza Dushku from Buffy the Vampire Slayer fame. In my book she's right up there as far as looks go. She plays Missy the hardened transfer student who joins the cheerleading squad only because the school doesn't have a gymnastics program. Making her start off as a badass then saying she was a gymnast didn't feel right to me. But she comes around pretty quickly and she and Torrance become fast friends. Also since this is a teen dramedy Torrance and her off to college boyfriend have problems and Missy's brother Cliff is right there to help Torrance out with all her cheerleader angst. OK so obviously the only reasons any guy would go see this movie is because either his girlfriend dragged him along or because he wants to see a bunch of girls in cheerleader outfits and tight clothing. And really can you blame him? The girls are attractive and putting them into various stages of dress and undress certainly can't hurt the grosses. Locker room scenes bikini car wash scenes and of course the cheerleading scenes were worth the price of admission for me which of course was only 3.75 one of the perks of living in suburbia.The soundtrack was pretty cool and the dancecheerleading sequences were actually quite well done. And the fact that the movie never wavered from its position that to these girls and some guys cheerleading was very important. To a majority of us who have never cheerleaded it's easy to say that it's not anything to get worked up about but I look at it like if you said that to a football player in a Texas high school you'd probably be shot on sight. Cheerleading is important to the cheerleaders and that's what this movie was about. Cheerleading. And hot girls in cheerleading outfits. Sorry I am a guy afterall.So overall yes Bring It On is cheesy with some over the top dialogue. But it also has some good music some good cheerleading scenes and of course it has the girls. It's not something that is going to be heard over the microphone at next years Academy Awards but I thought it was just good summer fun.".

And the friendship between Missy Pantone and Torrance Shipman looked as though it could last forever. Even a small movie like this one can be deserving of a 10 from me. The plot basically consisted of Torrance Shipman becomes captain of the Rancho Carne Toros cheerleading squad. A new girl on the team Missy Pantone becomes her best friend and shows her that all of their routines were stolen from the East Compten Clovers. They work to come up with a new routine for nationals and at the same time Torrance has the hotts for Missy's brother Cliff Pantone. At nationals the Toros come in second with their new and original routine and the East Compten Clovers win first and finally there is peace between the squads and it ends with a kiss between Torrance Shipman and Cliff Pantone. This is just the summary but I suggest that everyone go and watch it!".

Well yes it is it's witty smart and ever so amiable.

She was more of a motorcycle chicktomboy before she was convinced by Torrance to join the Toros. I like that she became more confident and more feminine after wards but still kept her sassy attitude. I also liked Torrance. Instead of her being a mean captain she was sweet and nice to everyone. I really liked Isis and Jenelope too. Isis had a great attitude and was a strong leader. Jenelope was just really funny. Great attitude. This movie didn't use corny humor. This movie was realistically funny and well acted. The cheer routines were also very good. The music the gymnastics the dance etc. They weren't those silly routines you see in movies. They were athletic and really cool! I would say my favorite routine was the Clover's routine at both regionals and at the finals. They were really interesting routines. But the Toros rocked too. The great actresses made the movie. Kirsten was sweet Eliza showed a lot of emotion and Gabriella is just the perfect part for Isis pretty athletic great actress perfect! This movie had a great script and great cheer leading. Watch it!

People find confusing that the movie shows both selfabsorbed cheerleaders who believe the endeavor to be worthwhile and meaningful and at the same time cheerleading's detractors. Also confusing is how a cheerleading squad could function without a faculty coach. The reason this is peripheral to the film is that the film is about fair play and sportsmanship and it succeeds in conveying that message.The dialogue is funny and approaches wit several times. My favorite line in the movie is delivered by Courtney Clare Kramer I don't mean to be predictable but I don't give a sh!! Perfect! The acting is pretty solid what seems like overacting to some is simply part of the satire that the movie is. I would recommend this movie to anyone.".

For instance it is beautifully filmed and also has an agreeable soundtrack and sprightly cheerleading choreography. The dialogue is smart and doesn't feel cringeworthy or inane the pacing is snappy and direction is decent. The performances from the cast are very spirited especially from Kirsten Dunst who is appealing in the lead. In conclusion not brilliant but energetic and dare I say fun. 710 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "Seeing Bring It On was more painful than having my wisdom teeth removed!! How this film made 17 million dollars in one weekend is even more beguiling. Is this what teenagers today relate to or were there just a lot of dirty old men who wanted to be teased by scantily clad adolescents? This film wants to be R rated but stay safely in the PG13 zone so what we get are ugly camera shots that are positioned just above the frontal nudity format.The plot A 5 time national champion cheerleading squad has to redeem itself after it is discovered that their award winning routine has been stolen from a much more talented inner city cheerleading squad. It's supposed to be a comedy but the only thing that made me laugh was the fact that this film was made. The young characters are so absorbed in cheerleading that you wonder how they plan to make a living after they graduate from high school they barely acknowledge the fact that they have classes to go to. None of them seem to have any genuine emotions and all of them are downright annoying. If these kids were in Friday the 13th people just might cheer for Jason. As I was watching it I began to realize that each scene was getting worse and worse. Some examples. The laborious scene where the cheerleaders audition a new member for their squad the captain insists on the weird girl while the other cheerleaders complain saying the process is supposed to be a democracy their corrected and told it's a cheerocracy. Then the captain is later referred to as a cheertator. There is also the scene where a choreographer who is recycled out of every dance movie ever made trains the girls. Amongst other things he tells one girl to starve herself to get thin that's just a wonderful idea to put into a teenage girl's head. Then there are the scenes with the inner city cheerleading squad that so tirelessly stereotype African American speech and manner that I was amazed that this film was released in the year 2000 and not 1950. What's depressing is that as this movie played I actually heard young people laughing. This is humorous to them? Then I came to the conclusion that as long as they keep going to movies like this we'll keep getting movie like this. Perhaps one day there will actually be a film that shows what it's truly like to be a teenager and it might even star actors who aren't in their thirty's. Until then we're  stuck with this AWFUL TRITE APALLING HORRENDOUS ODIOUS REVOLTING HIDEOUS LOATHSOME REPULSIVE IMMATURE NIGHTMARISH HORRID PIECE OF TRASH!!!!!!!!".

When his attempt fails miserably he cons his way into a Shaolin temple to learn to fight for real. But instead of making him a KungFu student the Master instead orders him to build a scaffolding to cover the roofs of all 36 chambers. Well it turns out that while he's performing these menial tasks stacking and tying bamboo poles that he's learning the skills to be a KungFu expert! It's sort of like in Karate Kid when Mr. Miagi teaches Daniel the basics of karate by having him do routine household chores Wax on wax off et cetera. There's lots of great comedy from beginning to end and plenty of action at the end when Gordon Liu once again faces his Manchu tormentors. This time it's not just tricks it's the real thing!

Gordon gets his butt kicked so he goes to Shaolin to actually become a shaolin master.

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Return to the 36th Chamber";
	schema:reviewBody "Return to the 36th Chamber is one of those classic KungFu movies which Shaw produces back in the 70s and 80s whose genre is equivalent to the spaghetti westerns of Hollywood and the protagonist Gordon Liu the counterpart to the western's Clint Eastwood. Digitally remastered and a new print made for the Fantastic Film Fest this is Presented in Shaw Scope just like the good old days.This film is a simple story of good versus evil told in 3 acts which more or less sums up the narrative of martial arts films in that era.Act One sets up the premise. Workers in a dyemill of a small village are unhappy with their lot having their wages cut by 20 by incoming manchu gangsters. They can't do much about their exploitation because none of them are martial arts skilled to take on the gangsters and their boss. At first they had a minor success in getting Liu to impersonate a highly skilled Shaolin monk one of the best comedy sequences but their rouse got exposed when they pushed the limit of credibility by impersonating one too many times.Act Two shows the protagonist wanting to get back at the mob. However without real martial arts he embarks on a journey to Shaolin Temple to try and infiltrate and learn martial arts on the sly. After some slapstick moments he finally gets accepted by the abbot whom he impersonated! but is disappointed at the teaching methods  kinda like Mr Miyagi's style in Karate Kid but instead of painting fences he gets to erect scaffoldings all around the temple. Nothing can keep a good man down and he unwittingly builds strength endurance and learns kungfu the unorthodox way.Act Three is where the fight fest begins. With cheesy sound effects each obvious noncontact on film is given the maximum impact treatment. But it is rather refreshing watching the fight scenes here with its wide angled shots to highlight clarity and detail between the sparring partners and the use of slowmotion only to showcase stunts in different angles. You may find the speed of fights a tad too slow with some pause in between moves but with Yuen Wo Ping and his style being used adnausem in Hollywood flicks they sure don't make fight scenes like they used to! Return to the 36th chamber gets a repeat screening on Monday so if you're game for a nostalgic trip down memory lane what are you waiting for?".

I paid 1 for it and the quality was horrible so I decided to go and buy the DRAGON DYNASTY release of THE 36TH CHAMBERS OF SHAOLIN. I was going to toss the older version when I happened to notice it was Johnny Wang on the cover so I put it in the player and sure enough it was RETURN TO THE THE 36TH CHAMBERS. Now I've gotta get a better version of this film because the DVD I have is a VHS transfer dollar DVD and it's horrible.Anyway so Gordon Liu is back but this time around he is playing a new character. I really loved him as San Te on the first one it was a serious and dark Kung Fu gem. This one he plays Jen Cheh and its one of those comedykungfu mixtures. I must admit I was extremely disappointed that it wasn't a real sequel to the first. I wish it had been under another name completely and still used the 36th chambers its not like anyone could replace Gordon for the part it just needed a different title. I hate when sequels get off from the first movie and do something like this.... NOT TO SAY THIS IS A BAD MOVIE AT ALL...Far from bad this is a great film unfortunately I have a horrible full screen version so I couldn't appreciate all Master Liu's direction had to offer I know it was good for what I could tell and even in full screen it captured a lot of the beauty of the fights especially in early scenes where Jen was pretending to be a monk.Gordon put on a lot of weight in the few years in between these movies and looked less like a kungfu champ and more like a regular guy which was good for his characters humble beginnings but not so good for where his character would've ended up with all that work and pseudo training.The movie has a small town's biggest economical leader a dye shop taken over by ruthless bosses in order to get a better assembly. They cut the pay and refuse to let workers leave so when a beggar posing as a monk comes to town they use him to fool the bosses and scare them with his fake fighting style. Ultimately the bosses find out this monk is a liar and they beat him up. He then goes to Shaolin Temple and unlike San Te in the first film Cha Jen Cheh doesn't get in to train with the others he is instead told to work and build scaffolding and repair all the roofs of all the chambers.He sets off working and even sleeping on the roof and spends all of his time watching the other pupils train. He mocks and imitates their moves and becomes an almost acrobatic master on his scaffolding. Once he finishes the job over a year later he asks to join now that hes done the work and the monk still refuses. He goes back home to sadly tell everyone he didn't get to train and they wonder what he's been doing for over a year while he was away. He soon realizes that he is a master of kung fu simply by watching and the imitation practices he had been doing and he takes on the evil boss played by Johnny Wang in one of the best fights ever filmed.You can never go wrong with the Shaw Bros. I've said it a million times.. here brothers Gordon and ChiLiang once again made a damn good movie...It a great film and if you love martial arts you will wanna check it out its not a true sequel but stands alone perfectly. My flaws was that it was super slow building up to the action it had way too much of a comedy aspect and I gave it 6 out of 10 stars.".

	schema:reviewBody "I thought this would be a sequel to the original 36th Chamber of Shaolin but actually it's more of a lighthearted sister to the original. Gordon Liu still stars as a wouldbe hero on a quest to learn kung fu to defeat those pesky Manchus... but this time around it's lighter and more comedic. The film centres around the local dye mill where wages are cut due to the hiring of 10 new Manchurian bosses. Liu plays Chao who is able to fool the mill bosses into thinking he is a shaolin monk possessing almost magical kung fu skill. But his luck runs out he is exposed as a fraud and he promises the mill workers that he will go to the Shaolin monastery to learn kung fu and return to protect them.The comedy really begins at the monastery where Chao makes several bungling attempts to get accepted. This sets up lots of really funny moments and lots of great fight choreography. Continuing in the 36th Chamber tradition we see all kinds of neat and interesting and supremely hokey training methods at the monastery as well as creative uses of wooden benches as weapons.Also unique and of note is the blending of kung fu and the craft of bamboo scaffold building. Chao is not accepted as a student at Shaolin but is made to build bamboo scaffolding for the 10 year restoration of the monastery. On the DVD I bought there is a special on bamboo scaffold building and the inspiration that director Lau KarLeung drew from it. This is a craft many hundreds perhaps thousands of years old and in Hong Kong scaffolding is still built of bamboo even on large highrises though the West exclusively uses steel tubes and clamps. As a result of his scaffolding work Chao develops a special style of kung fu... when asked what kind it is he hilariously replies scaffolding kung fu!! which he first tests during a dustup with the monastery's Abbot. In the final confrontation with the Manchus there is a dazzling array of creative uses for bamboo poles and ties.From a comedy perspective I think it's one of the best of the kung fu genre. As a kung fu film in general it also stands out... I recommend it to anyone!".

	schema:reviewBody "RETURN TO THE 36TH CHAMBER sees Gordon Liu returning to the film series that he's most famous for playing a different role in a very different story which nonetheless features the Shaolin Temple. This one's a very good Shaw film directed with his exemplary professionalism by the esteemed Lau KarLeung who injects finesse and quality into the film's many fight and training sequences.Some viewers may be put off by the way that RETURN TO THE 36TH CHAMBER is more of an outandout comedy than the original film but I enjoyed the change of pace and style. Everything is done a bit differently here so nothing is repetitive. Liu plays a smalltime actor who gets beaten up at the hands of Manchu thugs so he decides to break into the Shaolin Temple and spy on the monks training. It's pretty funny stuff with Liu on top physical form and convincing both as the novice weakling and as the kung fu expert.The Shaolin Temple scenes are fun and entertaining with all of the bizarre training we enjoy watching. I loved the way that Liu learns amid scaffolding here which gives him an addiction to bamboo which plays a big part in the fights at the film's climax which are lighter than usual but no less gruesome. As with almost all Shaw Brothers movies this is well shot well paced and looks absolutely brilliant in high definition a great mix of comedy drama and action.".

	onyx:emotionText "RETURN TO THE 36TH CHAMBER sees Gordon Liu returning to the film series that he's most famous for playing a different role in a very different story which nonetheless features the Shaolin Temple. This one's a very good Shaw film directed with his exemplary professionalism by the esteemed Lau KarLeung who injects finesse and quality into the film's many fight and training sequences.Some viewers may be put off by the way that RETURN TO THE 36TH CHAMBER is more of an outandout comedy than the original film but I enjoyed the change of pace and style.

	schema:reviewBody "The original 36th Chamber is known as one of the best Kung Fu movies of all time and I personally echo that sentiment putting it right up there with The Master of the Flying Guillotine Seven Grandmasters and The Invincible Armour. I was therefore worried that this movie has been tagged as sequel knowing that it was unlikely to live up to its predecessor. It turned out to be one of the best movies I have seen in the Kung FuWuxia genre. The story began in a not unfamiliar fashion where a group of laborers are exploited by their employer who hires some Manchus to essentially frighten them into working harder for less money. They try to fight back and to go on strike but are badly beaten by the Manchus. The workers then get there friend Chao JenCheh Gordon Lu an actor to pretend to be a dangerous Shaolin priest so he can intimidate the Manchus and the boss into treating them fairly but he is eventually found out as a fraud and he too is beaten terribly. After this Chao vows to go to Shaolin and learn Kung Fu for real and to return to set things straight. For the next while the movie takes a comedic turn as Chao tries many tricks to emerge himself in Shaolin's 36th Chamber a Kung Fu training zone and the Abbot takes pity on him allowing him to stay at Shaolin to put together Scaffolding and fix the temple roofs. Chao does this happily as it allows him to observe the 36th Chamber and he presumes he will be taken on as a student when the roof has been mended. However 3 years later when the work is complete he is distraught to find that he is asked to leave the temple without have received any Kung Fu training. He goes back to the village and explains to his worker friends that he has learned nothing. They are angry at him for having learned nothing the entire time he was away and attack him only to find that Chao has in fact picked up quite a bit simply from having observed the Shaolin students and having incorporated what he has seen into his scaffolding work. Having discovered him strength Chao challenges the Manchu and the boss who he is now able to defeat with considerable style.The oblivious training sequences in this film are great and again they justify the use of the label 36th Chamber as the original movie is well known for it fantastic training act. All great Kung Fu movies have an amazing training act and this one is no exception.Another thing which I loved about this movie was the unique scaffolding Kung Fu style which Chao learns. His time as a scaffolder means that his fighting style is one which largely consists of tying his opponents up. This is unique amusing entertaining impressive and also it brought the whole story together. This is because the laborers at the start are using colour sticks to mix sheets of cloth into dye. When the Manchus are introduces they bare their bamboo batons and declare facetiously these are our colour sticks. These in the final fight scenes are reminiscent of the bamboo poles that Chao uses in scaffolding the temple and as he takes the Manchus on he ties each of them and the batons together like scaffolding. It's brilliant the way this all ties together...The criticisms I have are only twofold and very very minor. Firstly I found it hard to believe when Chao returns to the village completely unaware that his skills have improved...then again this is a Kung Fu movie and anything can happen. Secondly one of the lead characters a worker who provides some early comic relief has enormous false teeth. This was supposed to be funny but is actually a big and unwelcome distraction.".

She expects her isolation and alienation to prod the muses but instead finds these new people and this new land to draw her in until they and it become the soul of her writing.The natural understated tone of the film allowed for a human resonance I've rarely seen in mainstream Hollywood fare. And while Mary Steenburgen and Peter Coyote are perfectly fine Rip Torn and Alfre Woodard's performances absolutely floored me. They respectively brought Marsh Turner and Geechee to life with such abandon and clarity it's some of the finest acting I've witnessed on film period.I revisit Cross Creek every few years and it always holds up stylistically Leonard Rosenman's score is timeless. Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings symbolizes America itself in my opinion so concerned with pleasing its own yet progressively exposed to a foreign world that ultimately will shape its real identity.It's a universally human story and like I said before I really connect with this little film and appreciate Director Martin Ritt's courage in making it the way he did. I can't guarantee that others will necessarily feel the same way but I always recommend Cross Creek to friends be they creatives or not.".

Because it was in the Top Ten lists of most of the noted critics that year and because of preconceived notions I had about critics and their 'lofty' reviews at the time. I am kicking myself soundly now for having done so. For those few out there not aware of this remarkable film yet CREEK is the biographical depiction of a period in the life of renowned author Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings when she moved to a very rural area of Florida became enamored of the place and its people and was inspired during that time to write some of her best work including the novel that defined her career THE YEARLING. Mary Steenburgen's career was just starting to come into its own when she made this film and her wonderful portrayal of the author as a strong independentminded woman at a time when being so was frowned upon is the movie's rocksolid center. Complementing her are marvelous turns by Peter Coyote as Norton Baskin the man who becomes extremely interested in Marjorie and becomes a big part of her life Rip Torn and Dana Hill as Cross Creek natives Marsh and Ellie Turner the father and daughter who according to this version of the story become the inspiration for Rawlings' bestknown work and Alfre Woodard who was also early in her career playing Marjorie's somewhat skittish yet steadfast housekeeper Geechee. Note must be made of all the actors in the small roles as well as they all add to the ambiance of this quiet almost serene backwoods community that Marjorie learned to call home and where she did much of her best work. A particularly haunting part of the film is when she encounters a young backwoodsman named Tim John Hammond and his beautiful pregnant wife Toni Hudson who also become the basis of another important Rawlings' story Jacob's Ladder which I am now determined to find.John Alonzo's photography brings an almost magical feel to the swamp and marshlands of the region and Leonard Rosenmann contributes a score that accents rather than interrupts the movie's flow.Plus there is a bonus in the form of an actor who was also an integral part of Steenburgen's personal life at the time portraying Max Perkins Marjorie's publisher. Fans of Mary will already know who I'm talking about and it is a treat to see them together again after their previous film TIME AFTER TIME. I wouldn't call this a 'family' film per se since the younger ones who might be disturbed by THE YEARLING or OLD YELLER will find this just as disconcerting. But for adults especially seeking to escape car chases exploding buildings or the latest adolescent yukfest CROSS CREEK will come as a welcome respite...as soothing and comforting as Ms. Rawlings eventually found it to be.".

	schema:reviewBody "Film fans best know the work of Marjorie Kiniston Rawlings through the adaption of her best known work The Yearling and the later filming of an original story for the screen in The Sun Comes Up. Cross Creek is our opportunity to look inside the mind and character of the woman who was the creator of these classics.As played beautifully by Mary Steenburgen we meet Rawlings during the Twenties as a woman with a passion to go to the land and a burning desire to write.

Cross Creek also got nominations for Best Music Score and Costume Design. Why Mary Steenburgen wasn't nominated for Best Actress is a mystery.One really ought to see Cross Creek back to back with The Sun Comes Up which was Rawlings original work for the screen and was Jeanette MacDonald's last film. Seeing Cross Creek puts a lot of The Sun Comes Up in context with MacDonald's character and with how Rawlings is interpreted by Steenburgen. Both films will take on a new dimension if anyone has not seen the other.Cross Creek is one excellent piece of film making about the genesis of a great American writer.".

What I will say is that this is one of the best character studies that I have EVER had the pleasure to see.Perhaps we have become too accustomed to the continuous actionpacked and often violent films of today for some viewers to fully appreciate a just plain good dramatic character study such as Cross Creek. Perhaps we've become too used to the language in today's films i.e. every other word being the f word... Maybe that at least in part accounts for how and why some might consider a just plain downtoearth GOOD drama as being boring.Give it another chance  this time watching it without expecting a thrill ride but rather in studying the effort in acting which goes into each and every one of the characters in the story.

	schema:reviewBody "Novelist Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings took to the backwoods of Florida in 1927 to work on her literary projects. She left behind a husband who was unwilling to relocate and fashioned a working studio in the most rural of southern locations.The trials she experienced both creatively and physically are depicted in this slowmoving yet wellintentioned enactment. Filmed in lovely Technicolor in Marion and Alachna Counties Florida by John Alonzo to the accompaniment of a lush score by Leonard Roseman the movie attempts to capture Rawling's varied experiences in pursuit of her writing goals.                             Like many films of truetolife creative artists one has little factual evidence as to the accuracy of this tale. The challenges Rawlings faced in attempting to first write her Gothic novel and getting rejected by a publisher are carefully acted out. Only when she changes her subject to that which she is actually experiencing there in Florida does her publisher accept the manuscript. Since there's not much dramatic about a writer pecking away at a typewriter the script finds other things to depict.  When a local girl has an emotional turn involving a pet deer and when the focus is on our heroine's saving her farm crops from devastation another plot begins to be recalled.One realizes this is the story of the woman who finally wrote the beloved family classic The Yearling. The film version of that novel after a failed attempt in the early forties with Spencer Tracy was finally brought to the screen in 1946 by Director Clarence Brown with Gregory Peck. That movie captures the essence of Rawlings' work again in a beautiful Florida setting. Cross Creek may perhaps appear to lack focus or be too deliberately paced for some tastes.  At the same time it has its heart in the right place in expressing Rawlings' unusual artist retreat as well as her steadfast dedication to her craft. For those who think writing is easy this may be a stark awakening as to the tenacity it often takes to birth a respectable literary work.".

It certainly evokes this part of Florida. I grew up about 25 miles from the setting. Some negatives lower my rating. But despite these I still highly recommend the film.Though many like the score I found it mostly sappy the only exceptions being the music created by the characters.Summer never seems to come. Once we see MKR wipe her brow. We get no sense of the oppression of the summer heat and humidity.But likewise winter never seems to come. For goodness sake when you're lighting fires to protect orange trees that's because it's FREEZING! Those orange trees won't be hurt above about 25F. And freezing weather in Florida is normally accompanied by wind. This may not seem like much to those who live farther north but it requires more serious clothing than most of the characters don. Yet none seem to notice that it's cold. And MKR's house wouldn't have been so well heated that she could sleep in that weather with only light clothes and covers.It never gets muddy. The movie shows some torrential downpours yet when the characters get back out on the roads and paths it's all dry and neat. That doesn't happen in the swamp.And it never seems to get buggy. We hear a couple of mentions of mosquitoes but mostly they don't seem like a big problem. People just sit and walk around with no sign that they notice.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was apparently made in 1983 and I can't believe this is the first time I've seen it. Many have commented that it is a pretty laid back movie and I agree. But laid back is not necessarily a bad thing. I for one did not realize that Florida had such lavish greenery and beautiful creeks. The beauty of the landscape was very well shown and I thoroughly enjoyed looking at it. As someone asked would we want to change these people to make the movie more exciting? No we wouldn't because that is the era that the movie is depicted in and laid back is what that time was. If one wanted to see an action packed movie then one should have looked at something else but this movie to me was truly beautiful and it made me go further into looking at the biographical life of Ms Kinnan Rawlings. In this age of internet and people being able to freely write their criticisms it is so easy for anyone to become a critic and I think that some people have been very critical of Ms Steenburger or Mr Ritt I think he is the director and the film itself. But how many of us if given the opportunity could do as good or better. It is time to sit back and enjoy some of these laidback movies and remember a time that is long past a time that we daresay we may never ever see again. Because in this age of killing and swearing and condos and high rise buildings it is wonderful to sit back and relax in a movie such as Cross Creek and embrace a time long past and almost forgotten.PS. I did not know Mary Steenburgen was previously married to Malcolm McDowell. Also Alfre Woodard was so great in this movie that I found myself wanting to know more about the character she depicted Geechee but obviously nothing much was said about Geechee even in Ms Rawlings' biography or autobiography of her. If anyone has any more info on that would be great to hear it.".

Because in this age of killing and swearing and condos and high rise buildings it is wonderful to sit back and relax in a movie such as Cross Creek and embrace a time long past and almost forgotten.PS. I did not know Mary Steenburgen was previously married to Malcolm McDowell. Also Alfre Woodard was so great in this movie that I found myself wanting to know more about the character she depicted Geechee but obviously nothing much was said about Geechee even in Ms Rawlings' biography or autobiography of her. If anyone has any more info on that would be great to hear it.";

	schema:reviewBody "This biography of Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings author of The Yearling covers her early career from her move to the rural Florida town of Cross Creek until she found her voice as an author and began being published.I felt Mary Steenburgen was miscast. To survive the hardships that Rawlings had to overcome in getting her dilapidated house in order and turning her orange grove into a successful operation would imply that she was a pretty tough woman both physically and mentally. When we see Steenburgen pitching in to clear tree roots and logs from a waterway she moves and acts more like a demure woman who would be more comfortable in fashionable society and when she expresses anger one does not feel daunted by it in the least  it's like she is just reading her lines. Steenburgen's slight performance is unfortunate since the entire supporting cast is quite good and Rip Torn is magnificent in his portrayal of Marsh Turner a feisty and colorful local. Torn breaths such life into the formidable but kindly Turner that I found myself just waiting out the times between his appearances. A woman of equal power to match Turner as I am sure the real Rawlings must have been would have raised this film above the average. Someone like Kathyrn Hepburn or Judi Dench would have been good for this part. The photography of rural 1930s Florida and the lush bayous was well done as were the period details of dress and autos. There are memorable and touching scenes like the one where Rawlings' housekeeper Geegee Alfre in a fine performance comes close to leaving. And the scenes involving the yearling in this movie are tremendously more powerful than they were in the movie The Yearling.Why certain real life facts were altered that would have made the story more believable and interesting is puzzling. In the movie we have Steenburgen announcing at an upscale New York party seemingly out of nowhere that she is going to move to Florida to manage an orange grove and if her husband does not want to come with her then that's the end of the marriage. In truth she purchased the land using an inheritance from her mother and her husband moved there with her. In short order her husband decided he could not take it and went back to New York.All in all I did not get a feeling that I got to know the real Rawlings and for that matter the person Steenburgen was playing did not seem real to me.".

The nuance acting did not stop with the four key roles as the supporting cast that included Paul Ike Eisenmann Mrs. Turner Joanna Miles Tim's wife Toni Hudson  the scene of Marjorie visiting her and the new baby did momentarily remind me of the 1979 wd Victor Nunez' small gem of the film Gal Young 'Un the Turner children however small the role may be had made Cross Creek whole.The opening credits included a frame thanking Mr. Norton Baskin Rawling's second husband who survived Marjorie by 44 years till 1997 for his assistance in the preparation and production of the film.

We see the various moods and aspects of Marjorie be it tempestuous headstrong or sheer charming especially when the subject is food and cooking.And it is absolutely true Cross Creek the film wouldn't have been existed if not for cinematographer John A.

	schema:reviewBody "Socalled Woman's Films containing narratives built around the dilemmas romantic or otherwise faced by the film's central female character were popular attractions at movie theaters throughout the 1930s and 1940s only to die out as tastes changed. Audiences were drawn to these films which usually featured strong female characters romance and stories of female perseverance. Cross Creek functions more or less as a woman's film. It's the story of Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings Mary Steenburgen the author of the classic novel The Yearling. Seeking inspiration after a fallow creative period Rawlings sets out despite the concerns and objections of others including her current husband to a remote part of rural backwoods Florida populated only by people who live off the land not because they have to but because it's the only way the know how to live. And they love it all the same. After an initial rough start in her new home in Cross Creek Rawlings perseveres. At Cross Creek with the help of her maid Geechee Alfre Woodard neighbors Rip Torn and Joanna Miles a farmhandmoonshiner Ike Eisenmann and the pastoral beauty of her surroundings Rawlings finds community solace and the inspiration to write The Yearling after a series of repeated rejections by her publisher. Marjorie's romantic life is a lesser concern for the film. She has a suitor Peter Coyote who she rejects at one point before agreeing to his proposal but the film is more about Marjorie's love for her surroundings. Martin Ritt captures the damp sweltering beauty of this part of Florida wonderfully. The production design and costumes are additionally well done.Refreshingly the film largely refuses to condescend to those who call Cross Creek home. When they could've easily been portrayed as a bunch of hicks for cheap laughs or simply out of derision Cross Creek's inhabitants are seen as normal people living in a unique environment. Only Geechee the maid played with wonderful exuberance by Alfre Woodard is rather clich ridden. It should be said that the film really isn't interested in Geechee at all  she doesn't even possess a real name The character is a stereotypically loyal deferential servant used occasionally to lighten the film's usually somber mood. And her boyfriend LeRoy is shown as simply shiftless. A few other faults remain with the film. Cross Creek in general has all the ingredients of a good Woman's Picture escapism female triumph and perseverance a little romance except for perhaps the most important part  a strong female lead. Steenburgen often appearing as she's about to wilt just isn't strong or compelling enough. She's awfully milquetoast and dainty in the lead role which makes her character's eventual triumphant adaptation to her often harsh and unwelcoming surroundings a little less believable. Coming off her massive success in Melvin  Howard Cross Creek was the first time she had the opportunity to headline a major motion picture and it was also basically the last time as well. The film decidedly character driven also drags at times and one occasionally may wonder over the course of the film's two hour running time about the film's larger meaning and the reasons for it being made. Is it about the importance of community the inspiring powers of nature a woman's quest for independence and meaning or is it simply the tale of how The Yearling came to be? The film doesn't quite seem to know either.".

The cinema was airconditioned.It was an early multiscreen complex and I somehow got into the wrong venue. I had intended to doze through something else. But as things transpired there would be no sleeping. Shortly after the wrong movie began I was additionally disconcerted by a group of female cleaners who came in and used it as their social club. I was the only other person there and it is a measure of the movie's appeal that they habitually expected the place to be empty and asked me if I minded their presence. I didn't.Within about half an hour the cleaners' conversation proved to be more interesting than the entertainment I had paid for.This movie oozed out of the screen with the cheesiness of very stale mayonnaise. The kind that has little dark hairy tufts growing on the surface. I particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning. The cleaners provided an anticipatory cue by putting their fingers in their ears.It was about some city bird going to live in the sticks amongst a load a backwood folk putting them straight but at the same time being taught a moral lesson or two herself. Like you do. A sort of 'journey of discovery'. There was a sententious smugness about the whole production. In particular the leading actress had an irritating habit of staring at every hick with a kind of intense beatific compassion as if she herself were the patronsaint of thickies.And I believe at some stage she wrote a book.Long before the end I had become fascinated by one of the cleaner's hushed and breathy tails of sexual impropriety.One suspects that there are some to whom sitting quietly for a couple of hours and not having to think constitutes a meditation. The best that I can say is that I would not want to share their salad.I have never seen this movie advertised as showing on television which surprises me. It is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs.If you ever work shifts be sure to get into the right theatre.

I say this only because CrossClub opens with a dedication to Lucio Fulci...only this film seems to mimic those unmentionable films that Fucli has done. Now don't get me wrong...I'm not saying that this film is trash...rather I am saying it is up there with Bad...bad Fulci...I'm talking Black Cat House of Clocks Voices from Beyond...etc. I don't like Fulci and this film follows his lead which leads to my distaste. Further I see so much independent German Horror that I tend to expect a bit more from releases...particularly on the XT or XRated Labels. This film may be a good entry into German Underground if you have not seen any films or only a few imports...it will set the standard of what to expect and test you on what you can tolerate. Basically done on a no Budget premise the film deals with a satanic sacrifice gone wrong and interrupted by armed troops...the kid to be sacrificed is rescued grows up and then yep...zombies... The acting and costume is bad...but give them credit they tried and created wardrobes on what they had. Like many of the German films the natural sets and locations are amazing and brilliant a beautiful background to the horror on the film. The story though like many in the genre is weak...But again..it's not that bad and really is for true fans...if you've seen a lot of the underground films you can skip this one it is nothing new however if you are new to the genre this is an easy import to find and is a good example of whats to come your way if you continue on in your search for obscure foreign horror.".

For Sal however the restaurant represents something that is part of his life and sees it as a part of the community.

As an artful and intelligent examination of the ethics of violence and prejudice Do the Right Thing is unparalleled. It implies a simple profound question  what is the 'right thing'?

There are a lot of good people a lot of bad people and a very realistic majority of people who are usually somewhere in the middle but also somewhat confused throughout this film. African American Latino East Asian and Italian American cultures form the dynamics of the relationships that drive the story and conflict is their medium. Drawing from two incisive but different comments on violence from Martin Luther King and Malcolm X Lee extrapolates his story and the ideas he wants to explore by showing us characters that are as real as they are exaggerated and somewhat unpredictable events that they create are swept into or actively or passively participate in.

Spike doesn't put as much emphasis on the characters themselves as he does on the relationships and the tension between them and in this image of a very specific and small frame in time and place makes a strong and important message about racism and race relations in general. The film is populated with many different characters all of them very memorable and each one a representative of a certain belief mode of behavior or state of mind  on both sides of the conflict. From the uninhibited anger of Buggin Out Giancarlo Esposito and Radio Raheem Bill Nunn on one side and Pino John Torturro on the other side to Jade Joie Lee Spike's sister in the film and in real life and Vito Richard Edson who are trying to connect and live at peace with the other side to Da Mayor Ossie Davis in his isolated but peaceful state of mind living in complete peace with the world around him and Smiley Roger Smith living in his own isolated existence. Then there's Mookie who is stuck in the middle torn between his commitment and responsibilities to both sides. Finally we have Mister Senor Love Daddy  played gorgeously by the one and only Samuel L.

Each and every character plays an important part in the climatic and dramatic conflict to which the movie builds up and though it's the radical ones  Buggin Out and Radio Raheem  who trigger the events that cause the tragedy they are not necessarily the ones who finish it. It is Mookie and Sal in fact who ultimately play the main part.Do The Right Thing is not an easy watch it's a mesmerizing tense difficult film that breaks many taboos and slaughters many holy cows. But in the end of it  hopefully  you'll be wiser than you were in the beginning and that's what Lee have always tried to achieve in all his films. Watch it to get a real view on racism that doesn't duck the difficult issues and isn't afraid to tackle the real problem and to see a master director at work. It's one of the best films of its time.".

Do the Right Thing is a masterpiece in both style and substance and Im hard pressed to think of a more powerful earthshattering film.But first let's talk about the style. The color palette of the movie is wonderful while its mostly deep reds they manage to bring home the feeling that the residents of BedStuy must have been feeling on that day. The cinematography is excellent... it features a lot of weird viewpoints and angles but they are used to great effect and manage to work within the style of the film. One thing that really managed to impress me about the film is the razor sharp dialogue... each character has their own style of talking and it really works well. This is a masterfully written film.Now the substance... this movie manages to spiral into a truly spectacular ending. Throughout its easy to see the necessary elements building and when it happens it hardly seems like a surprise but that doesn't make it any less shattering. The way that each character acts defines this movie throughout especially at the end! Spike Lee does a brilliant job here. The movie is interesting and wellmade throughout each of the characters are threedimensional and feel like real human beings  their motivation is understood throughout. Do the Right Thing is a brilliant movie that never lags and never lets up. It manages to be vastly entertaining and vastly powerful at the same time. It's truly an amazing achievement in film and its a shame it was not recognized more for its obvious brilliance when it was released in 1989.".

	schema:reviewBody "Do the Right Thing is a powerful uplifting visually stunning masterpiece.  It's a movie that I can watch over and over again and deservedly takes the Number 7 Spot of My Favorite Movies Of All Time.  This was one of Spike's debut efforts and until this daythe best one.  Spike gives us an honest unflinching look at the BedfordStuyvestant area of Brooklyn on the hottest day of the summer.  He perfectly displays the racial tensions that go on between everybody from blacks to whites to Koreans.  Yet he never gets preachy which is one of the brilliant things about this movie.  Some of Spike's best work is demonstrated in his shots of Radio Raheem played excellently by Bill Nunn.  RR doesn't say much but he has this violent gaze which sums up his feelings without a word being said. Spike gives us some great angles of his face demonstrating the pure rage brewing inside of him.  He also has a great scene in which he sums up the meanings of love and hate in Spike's trademark poetryinmotion style.  RR constantly carries around a boombox playing the same song Fight the Power by Public Enemy.  That song is one of the best musical themes in movie history perfectly summing up racial tension among inner cities.  This movie doesn't tell its audience that black people are better than others nor does it say that Hispanics are or whites or Asians.  It just gives us a raw look at what happens when we let racial quarrels get out of hand.  We learn how sometimes it's appropriate to preach against racism and sometimes we're just overreacting.The cast is terrific and they deliver memorable performances.  I really wish Danny Aiello picked up the Oscar for his role as Sal because that is definitely the pinnacle performance of his career and one of the best I've ever seen.  Other noteworthy performances are by John Turturro Ossie Davis and Giancarlo Esposito.  The film is put together with such fastpaced editing that it doesn't once get boring doesn't have any low points.  This is a gritty memorable film that I wish can be considered more prominent in the eyes of the average moviegoer because it really deserves great recognition for its unique unforgettable style.  Spike definitely knows how to do the right thing.My score  10 out of 10".

I know that Spike Lee is a rather eccentric personality and is not well liked by everyone but his films are brilliant and this is no exception.  For about the first two thirds of the movie the plot meanders around a section of New York City as the characters awaken and start their days.  For this first two thirds we have a comedy that is funny because of the eccentric and wonderfully developed characters.  The audience is pulled into the story by the rich dialogue and inventive cinematography.  There is just some quality about this film that makes it seem so real.  This all sets up for  the imminent tragedy to be all the worse as a result of the connection the audience has with the movie.Then the film explodes.  Those who have seen it know what I mean and those who have not should see it.  This last third of the film should not be explained it must be experianced.

	schema:reviewBody "It's sometimes difficult to separate artists' public statements from the work they're commenting on or to ignore the politically charged aura a film generates. There's always that nagging feeling that a movie's point must be sussed out that the real intentions of the filmmaker must be understood. But in retrospectand despite director Spike Lee's rhetoricDo the Right Thing may not be as profound as previously thought. While it should be applauded for taking on the subject of race without Hollywood's usual heavyhandedness simply presenting a topic doesn't automatically mean anything is actually being said about that topic.Whatever problems there are with the content Do the Right Thing is still great filmmaking. It's a vibrant passionate funny movie and like a true work of art it both surprises and provokes. It's technically audacious and features one of the most successful displays of stifling suffocating heat ever put on film.and it does it without being languid itself. The dialogue is fast paced the characters energetic and the camerawork unpredictable full of clever pans and Twilight Zone angles. And except for the always excruciating Martin Lawrence the performances are uniformly good throughout. Lee also manages to outAltman Altman by presenting a large cast of characters without it ever becoming confusing or disjointed.Taking place over the course of one scorching day in BedfordStuyvesant most of the action occurs in and around a pizzeria run by Sal Danny Aiello and his sons Pino and Vito John Turturro Richard Edson. But the entire neighborhood is featured as the film intercuts between various exchanges many of them tinged with racial overtones while Buggin Out Giancarlo Esposito challenges a white tenement owner when he feels slighted down the street three men debate the right of a Korean to own a variety store in their neighborhood.There are personal moments as well Da Mayor Ossie Davis continually attempts to soften Mother Sister's Ruby Dee opinion of him while Mookie Lee juggles time between his job at Sal's and his increasingly aggravated girlfriend Rosie Perez. Although Lee doesn't have the time to make all his characters threedimensional he avoids sentimentalizing or demonizing any one group there are both blacks and whites who are sympathetic Sal Da Mayor and troublesome Pino Radio Raheem. Only the Korean storeowner played by Steven Parks is a blatant caricature. Asians seem to get short shrift no matter who is behind the camera. Presiding over the action is disc jockey Senor Love Daddy Samuel L. Jackson. Like Wolfman Jack in American Graffiti he provides ongoing background music as well as periodic commentary.Eventually the heat and personal tensions culminate in an explosion of violence centered on Sal's pizzeria. The violence escalates after one of the characters is killed. It's at this point that the film becomes problematic. The murder is supposed to be a tragedy meant to provoke outrage in the audience. But the killing of a fictional character isn't enough in itself to warrant a reaction. It's not that audiences are jaded but drama usually elicits judgement based on the narrative alone. If a character is a jerk his death won't elicit much of a response. Like Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ Do the Right Thing relies too heavily on the personal baggage audiences are supposedly bringing to the film. Drawing on contemporary events and feelings may be provocative but it dates the film and makes for poor drama. The reactions of Mookie and Mother Sister to the murder may have been understandable to a disenfranchised group but in the context of the plot they appear unmotivated almost random.The somewhat ambiguous nature of the movie could easily be trumpeted as a selling point. Lee doesn't want to hold your hand he wants you to make up your own mind. But there is a fine line between bravely ambiguous and maddeningly directionless. While Oliver Stone continually has been pilloried for his blatantly didactic films there is something to be said for being recklessly personal and taking a stand. Lee made a movie about racism but we're so starved for challenging works for thematically mature movies we've embraced a film that ultimately says nothing more than racism is bad and no one person or group is to blame.The simplistic ideals of Do the Right Thing are most evident in four scenes 1 Love Daddy lists practically every major black musician from the last fifty years 2 in an overly contrived sequence Mookie gets Pino to admit that his cultural heroes are all black Magic Johnson Eddie Murphy and Prince 3 Martin Luther King Malcolm X Al Sharpton Jesse Jackson and Louis Farrakhan are all mentioned 4 the words Tawana Told the Truth appear spray painted on a wall a reference to the Tawana Brawley controversy of 1987. No differentiation is made between the listed artists and no context is given for the black leaders mentioned. These aren't explorations of raciallycharged issues it's just name dropping.Despite its flaws Do the Right Thing provokes discussion. It's an impossible film to dismiss. Spike Lee's subsequent career has turned out to be a disappointment but Do the Right Thing along with Malcolm X represent Lee at his creative peak.".

	schema:reviewBody "If I had to make a list of the top ten things that I find most boring racism would be right at the summit along with economics and The Blair Witch Project. For that reason I have avoided Do the Right Thing up until now for fear that it would be a lecture on racism...but actually I don't know what I was afraid of as this film is really good. Spike Lee's racial drama is actually more a film about the feebleness of racial divides and how violence only breeds violence as opposed to a film ABOUT racism. In fact the film can be best described as a cinematic materialisation of Martin Luther King's famous an eye for an eye leaves everybody blind speech.For this movie Spike Lee has put together a terrific cast that includes many actors that have gone on to become big names in the movie industry people such as Samuel L. Jackson John Turturro and Martin Lawrence not to mention smaller stars such as Ossie Davis. The cast comes together excellently and the neighbourhood that Spike Lee has created for this film feels very real and through the multiple personalities that inhabit it it manages to stay interesting and realistic throughout. The atmosphere of the neighbourhood is also of note and you really do get the feeling that someone could say 'biatch' or 'dogg' at any time. Spike Lee delights in showing us many different people and at different times  including their reactions to certain events and their interactions with each other and it all helps to build up both their own characters and the neighbourhood that they live in. This proves to be invaluable to the film as it has no real plot and therefore relies on the characters and the neighbourhood that it has created to build itself it's scenario and therefore it's message up.Do the Right Thing is a portrait of how multiple cultures live together in modern day America and it also succeeds in being a stark and potent portrayal of how violence never gets anyone anywhere. Spike Lee has shown his talents as an actor director and a writer with this film and even though majority opinion of him seems to be that he's a disagreeable old crone at least he's one that has talent.".

For that reason I have avoided Do the Right Thing up until now for fear that it would be a lecture on racism...but actually I don't know what I was afraid of as this film is really good. Spike Lee's racial drama is actually more a film about the feebleness of racial divides and how violence only breeds violence as opposed to a film ABOUT racism. In fact the film can be best described as a cinematic materialisation of Martin Luther King's famous an eye for an eye leaves everybody blind speech.For this movie Spike Lee has put together a terrific cast that includes many actors that have gone on to become big names in the movie industry people such as Samuel L. Jackson John Turturro and Martin Lawrence not to mention smaller stars such as Ossie Davis. The cast comes together excellently and the neighbourhood that Spike Lee has created for this film feels very real and through the multiple personalities that inhabit it it manages to stay interesting and realistic throughout. The atmosphere of the neighbourhood is also of note and you really do get the feeling that someone could say 'biatch' or 'dogg' at any time. Spike Lee delights in showing us many different people and at different times  including their reactions to certain events and their interactions with each other and it all helps to build up both their own characters and the neighbourhood that they live in. This proves to be invaluable to the film as it has no real plot and therefore relies on the characters and the neighbourhood that it has created to build itself it's scenario and therefore it's message up.Do the Right Thing is a portrait of how multiple cultures live together in modern day America and it also succeeds in being a stark and potent portrayal of how violence never gets anyone anywhere. Spike Lee has shown his talents as an actor director and a writer with this film and even though majority opinion of him seems to be that he's a disagreeable old crone at least he's one that has talent.";

	schema:reviewBody "Do the Right Thing begins with girls dancing over the opening credits and the dance is sure to make you laugh. It's extraordinarily dated having been copied in a billion rap videos and even The Cosby Show and today it seems very silly. As the film progresses you're likely to notice dozens of other instances of severe dating that might make you giggle. Heck if you didn't know that he was in it already you're sure to laugh a little when you see that Martin Lawrence is in the film. Why did this dating happen? Well simply because the film was so influential that other artists coopted pieces of it all over the place. This would destroy a regular movie. Fortunately Do the Right Thing is no ordinary movie.This truly is one of the best films ever made. It's a masterpiece by one of the most talented and unfortunately most maligned directors alive. Spike Lee does not have the answers to the questions he poses and sometimes I do object to the way he handles the situation. Sometimes I do ask the questions when I am watching one of his films why does he have to be so angry about everything? Why doesn't he try to think these things out? But I have great empathy for all emotions and Lee is great at expressing his feelings on film. When I watch his films I sympathize with what is happening. Do the Right Thing is pitched at a feverish pace and it's filled with enormous joy and simultaneously with enormous anger. This ambiguous mood is expressed most directly by the character Radio Rahim in a scene adapted from the great film Night of the Hunter where Radio recites Robert Mitchum's The Battle Between Love and Hate speech. Immediately in the film we see that the races are capable of getting along. One black man is angry that Sal who owns the local pizzeria only hangs up pictures of Italian Americans on his wall but no African Americans. Other African Americans find his objection somewhat ridiculous and respect Sal very much. Some African Americans object to a Korean couple who have successfully opened a grocery store on a certain corner but others believe they are just savvy businessmen. On the other hand there is a great amount of tension between the same races. Sal is basically a good man but he has grown very hard and his temper is short. Radio Rahim walks in and yes rudely leaves his radio blasting while he tries to buy some pizza. However did Sal really have to swear and order him to turn the radio off? Couldn't he as Radio wonders later on have at least said please? Lee's feelings about the entire situation are clearly ambiguous. The entire film is felt deeply and there is never any intellectualizing in the script. It is vitally important that Lee casts himself as Mookie a young shiftless man who works as a deliveryman for Sal. It is Mookie who has the choice of whether to do the right thing or not. Perhaps some will be less forgiving about the film's late 1980s trappings. Even if they find it silly or unwatchable I will guarantee that in 30 years when the 1980s and even 1990s are far behind us Do the Right Thing will be considered one of America's greatest films as it more than deserves to be right now in 2001. 1010.".

Seen through many points of view Spike Lee paints a convincing and critical picture of tensions in the most diverse city in the USA.The film's strength is its ability to ring true to many sets of ears and especially if you frequent or live in a big city. You always here of events  big and small  on the news and there is usually that element of racial tensions or possible racial motive. In a city where over 200 different languages are spoken which can give you an idea of how many distinguishable cultures there are it is only a natural ingredient for friction between people. Whether you hate the other guy or are just annoyed that you can't understand him nor he you when all you want to do is buy some groceries. This film shows many situations of this type and how everyone is in a sense innocent and guilty at the same time. If a situation gets out of hand and you have people throwing slurs at each other there is that famous expression he crossed the line. Well even with critical hindsight this line isn't always visible and when it is it's faint.Spike Lee manages to show that very well and with a lot of diverse characters hence the film being able to ring true with an equally diverse audience.The only problem is that in today's America the issue is more about class and not just race though race and class are intertwined. Crash presented the issue of class and lifestyle a little bit more thoroughly but in the end felt preachy and unrealistically sentimental. Do the Right Thing is much tighter and the film's climax and overall impact is more powerful. Also of the note is the terrific acting from the entire cast.  910Rated R for profanity and some violence".

	schema:reviewBody "I did not like Do the Right Thing very much at all. For one thing it's boring with much of the film's screen time wasted on pointless subplots like Mook's relationship with his girlfriend. But mainly I don't like it because it's clearly a message movie except it's message is super unclear and confusing. For 90 of the film I thought that Mook was supposed to be the moral hero of the story because he works at the Italian restaurant and empathizes with its owners. But then at the end he causes the destruction of the restaurant his own place of employment and the livelihood of his supposed friends. A lot of people think he did this to help Sal but then why would he go back and poor salt in the wound the next morning? Admittedly I really didn't get it. I thought it was either a movie about a large group of unintelligent angry innercity residents which was meant to show people the error of their ways a cause that to me seemed like it would be ineffective and rather selfdestructive or I though it could be a championing bravado meant to invigorate African American audiences a theory supported by the overplayed fight the power . Neither of my theories felt like they could be accurate. I decided I needed to read some analyses of the film to better understand and from reading them I've learned that.... I still don't get it. Is it supposed to be a little bit of both? The movie is so contradicting. The only two characters in the film which seemed to represent wisdom and understanding were the mayor and mothersister. However the mayor was a drunk who everyone hated and mothersister was screaming burn it down during the riot. Also I thought that the radio dude was supposed to be a good guy as well because of his little speech about love conquering hate. But then he chokes out Sal near the end. Is this film about hypocrites? The scene I dislike the most is when the mentally handicapped guy puts the picture on Sal's wall. What is that action supposed to mean exactly..... the retard is a retard? Redundant! Why would any director do that? Sal can do what he pleases with his wall It's his wall! That's his individual right. The sequence is given heavy emphasis and seems to be stating that the picture belongs there where that handicapped man put it. In my opinion the only logical conclusion one can come to is that the rioters are purposefully portrayed as heroes after all.Mook obviously did what he thought was the right thing clearly it wasn't. Most people reason that that's the point that Mook had a twisted view on things. I disagree I think Spike Lee was saying that in the end the pizzeria needed to be brought down and that the crowed did what was righteous and justified. My interpretation of the quotes at the end is that the first quote refers to the barbaric actions of the police and the second the quote about self defense to the demolition of Sal's restaurant. A demolition which in my opinion was completely unwarranted.".

I thought it was either a movie about a large group of unintelligent angry innercity residents which was meant to show people the error of their ways a cause that to me seemed like it would be ineffective and rather selfdestructive or I though it could be a championing bravado meant to invigorate African American audiences a theory supported by the overplayed fight the power . Neither of my theories felt like they could be accurate. I decided I needed to read some analyses of the film to better understand and from reading them I've learned that.... I still don't get it. Is it supposed to be a little bit of both? The movie is so contradicting. The only two characters in the film which seemed to represent wisdom and understanding were the mayor and mothersister. However the mayor was a drunk who everyone hated and mothersister was screaming burn it down during the riot. Also I thought that the radio dude was supposed to be a good guy as well because of his little speech about love conquering hate. But then he chokes out Sal near the end. Is this film about hypocrites? The scene I dislike the most is when the mentally handicapped guy puts the picture on Sal's wall. What is that action supposed to mean exactly..... the retard is a retard? Redundant! Why would any director do that? Sal can do what he pleases with his wall It's his wall! That's his individual right. The sequence is given heavy emphasis and seems to be stating that the picture belongs there where that handicapped man put it. In my opinion the only logical conclusion one can come to is that the rioters are purposefully portrayed as heroes after all.Mook obviously did what he thought was the right thing clearly it wasn't. Most people reason that that's the point that Mook had a twisted view on things. I disagree I think Spike Lee was saying that in the end the pizzeria needed to be brought down and that the crowed did what was righteous and justified. My interpretation of the quotes at the end is that the first quote refers to the barbaric actions of the police and the second the quote about self defense to the demolition of Sal's restaurant. A demolition which in my opinion was completely unwarranted.";

For example Buggin' Out wanted to boycott Sal's because he didn't have a black figure on the wall. I understand that Sal sells pizza in a black neighborhood but that is his restaurant and he gets to choose what to do with it. When the inevitable violence breaks out I once again believe this was portrayed in the wrong way. Radio and Buggin' Out instigated the whole argument which lead to destruction. This is not a racial tension that is just pure stupidity and lack of character on their part. Sal did no wrong and ended up paying the price. I also was not a fan of Sal paying Mookie at the end of the film. Mookie smashed Sal's window right in front of him and wanted to be paid for it. I thought that and many other parts of the film were ridiculous.".

	schema:reviewBody "Spike Lee's DO THE RIGHT THING is one of the most vibrant upbeat tragedies of the American cinema. Set in a small neighborhood in Brooklyn's BedfordStuyvescant region it's the story of the various people that inhabit the block as they try to live and work under a palpable air of racial tension culminating in a tragic and thoughtprovoking climax that is still widely debated. Mookie Spike Lee is ostensibly the main character in a rich ensemble cast. He's a pizza delivery boy for Sal's Famous Pizzeria a local institution run by the goodhearted Sal Danny Aiello and his two sons the racist Pino John Turturro and the quiet and sweetnatured Vito Richard Edson. Also living on the block is the drunken sage Da Mayor Ossie Davis the allseeing Mother Sister Ruby Dee the local DJ Senor Love Daddy Samuel L. Jackson Mookie's sister Jade Joie Lee and his girlfriend Tina Rosie Perez. These characters are brought vividly to life by an amazing cast and the entire film is filled with loud boisterous dialogue and music and the neighborhood itself is presented in bright ostentatious neon colors. All of these work to both offset and accentuate the senseless tragedy that the day's end will bring.It's a record heat wave day and trouble starts to brew when Mookie's hotheaded friend Buggin' Out Giancarlo Esposito angrily notices that the Wall of Fame in Sal's is decorated only with pictures of successful Italian Americans and no black people. Buggin' tries to get the neighborhood to boycott Sal's but most refuse because Sal's has been in the neighborhood for 25 years and many of the inhabitants grew up on his pizza. Buggin' finally gets the hulking Radio Raheem Bill Nunn to join his cause because Sal treated him rudely earlier when Radio refused to turn down the boombox he blasts twentyfourseven. Words are exchanged the boombox is smashed and a riot ensues. Radio is killed by the police and Mookie throws a trash can through the window of the pizzeria which is eventually burned to the ground. The biggest question most viewers will be left with is why. Why would Mookie throw the trashcan after Sal just said that he considered Mookie to be like a son to him? Was it because of Sal's affection for Jade? Was it the death of Radio Raheem? Was it because he truly believed that Sal was wrong in his actions and that the place needed to be destroyed? Or is it simply because Mookie is drifting through his life and suddenly sees the opportunity to do something important? Why couldn't Buggin' Out have behaved less antagonistically about the pictures? Why couldn't Sal whose clientle is almost completely black just have put some pictures of black people up? Lee offers no answers to any of these questions because answering these would be deciphering human nature. The film is about ignorance in every community and how people are too proud or too stubborn to speak out there differences and come to rational conclusions. The destruction of Sal's didn't bring Radio Raheem back to life. It didn't even make anyone feel better about the loss. But it was done in the heat of anger and it can't be taken back. The biggest tragedy for the viewer is that we all know what could have been done to prevent everything but we also know that given the same opportunities over again no one would have behaved differently.".

	schema:headline " A Mediocre Look at Serious Issues";
	schema:reviewBody "Spike Lee's film Do the Right Thing is a daring risky piece that looks at the serious social issues of race relations and violence.  Unfortunately Lee chose to tackle these issues in only his fourth ever film...his first for a major studio.  Lee's inexperience shows.  While the film is visually stunning it lacks a cohesive story or a coherent plot.Do the Right Thing is set in the BedfordStuyvesant BedStuy neighborhood of Brooklyn on the hottest day of the summer.  Production designer Wynn Thomas and Cinematographer Ernest R. Dickerson evoke the heat of the day visually with the use of various hues of red in costuming lighting and scene painting.  Particularly stunning is the bright red wall in front of which three neighborhood men sit all day and complain.  The perceived temperature is driven up at least five degrees just through that use of color.  It also provides a visual connection to the dissatisfaction and hate these men continually vent.It would have been nice to see the amount of red on the screen change as time passes.  By constantly bombarding the viewer with bright red Thomas keeps the heat level constant.  The only shot in the movie that increases the perceived temperature after the first five minutes is a shot of random people on the street with heat waves rising in front of the camera.  Had the use of red been tempered early in the film and then allowed to grow as the day gets hotter the audience would more clearly see the heat increasing and have a more visually fulfilling experience.The film also has trouble establishing a coherent theme.  The film's climax is particularly rich in contradictions.  As the riot ensues Lee uses canted angles fast hard cuts and alternates long shot and tight medium shot to make the viewer feel uncomfortable watching the violent acts that are taking place.  The viewer can find no frame of reference from which to observe the action.  This causes the viewer to be unsettled.  Ordinarily this technique is employed to convey the idea that the action on the screen is wrong.minor spoilerAs the riot comes to a close however the character Smiley walks into the pizzeria and hangs a picture of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. on the wall.  As he does so he is shot at eyelevel in a medium closeup. Behind him flames billow up creating a halo around his head ennobling him. Smiley was one of the people who started the riot.  By ennobling him Lee ennobles the violence Smiley advocates.  Is the viewer supposed to approve of the violence or disapprove?  The film's conclusion is no help there. Conflicting quotes from Dr. King and Malcolm X provide the same contradiction.  Is violence an acceptable means of dealing with racism? What is the viewer supposed to believe as a result of seeing the film?A film that strongly conveys a viewpoint must be consistent.  It is permissible for films to be ambiguous thematically but when they are they must be truly ambiguous to succeed.  By conveying antiviolent and proviolence ideas both effectively Lee only causes the audience to be confused.  Perhaps if he had more experience as a storyteller his effort would have been more successful.".

	onyx:emotionText "Spike Lee's film Do the Right Thing is a daring risky piece that looks at the serious social issues of race relations and violence.  Unfortunately Lee chose to tackle these issues in only his fourth ever film...his first for a major studio.  Lee's inexperience shows.  While the film is visually stunning it lacks a cohesive story or a coherent plot.Do the Right Thing is set in the BedfordStuyvesant BedStuy neighborhood of Brooklyn on the hottest day of the summer.  Production designer Wynn Thomas and Cinematographer Ernest R. Dickerson evoke the heat of the day visually with the use of various hues of red in costuming lighting and scene painting.  Particularly stunning is the bright red wall in front of which three neighborhood men sit all day and complain.  The perceived temperature is driven up at least five degrees just through that use of color.  It also provides a visual connection to the dissatisfaction and hate these men continually vent.It would have been nice to see the amount of red on the screen change as time passes.  By constantly bombarding the viewer with bright red Thomas keeps the heat level constant.  The only shot in the movie that increases the perceived temperature after the first five minutes is a shot of random people on the street with heat waves rising in front of the camera.  Had the use of red been tempered early in the film and then allowed to grow as the day gets hotter the audience would more clearly see the heat increasing and have a more visually fulfilling experience.The film also has trouble establishing a coherent theme.  The film's climax is particularly rich in contradictions.  As the riot ensues Lee uses canted angles fast hard cuts and alternates long shot and tight medium shot to make the viewer feel uncomfortable watching the violent acts that are taking place.  The viewer can find no frame of reference from which to observe the action.  This causes the viewer to be unsettled.  Ordinarily this technique is employed to convey the idea that the action on the screen is wrong.minor spoilerAs the riot comes to a close however the character Smiley walks into the pizzeria and hangs a picture of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. on the wall.  As he does so he is shot at eyelevel in a medium closeup. Behind him flames billow up creating a halo around his head ennobling him. Smiley was one of the people who started the riot.  By ennobling him Lee ennobles the violence Smiley advocates.  Is the viewer supposed to approve of the violence or disapprove?  The film's conclusion is no help there. Conflicting quotes from Dr. King and Malcolm X provide the same contradiction.  Is violence an acceptable means of dealing with racism? What is the viewer supposed to believe as a result of seeing the film?A film that strongly conveys a viewpoint must be consistent.  It is permissible for films to be ambiguous thematically but when they are they must be truly ambiguous to succeed.  By conveying antiviolent and proviolence ideas both effectively Lee only causes the audience to be confused.  Perhaps if he had more experience as a storyteller his effort would have been more successful.";

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERSI saw this movie recently and I found myself disturbingly reminded of why I hate this film so much.Now maybe some who have praise for this film are a little perplexed by this so let's look at a few points we have a black man who goes into a pizzeria and decides to incite a riot because there are no pictures of black people on the wall. Maybe if this guy had something to do maybe he wouldn't think like this. But really who cares about pictures on the wall? Why would anyone want pictures of black people on the wall when he comes into an Italian pizzeria? But that's just for starters folks. We've got another guy who walks around the neighborhood playing the same song looking mean having zero respect for anyone who's not black looking for trouble and finally getting it. Again give this guy a job. Finally we've got a poor employee at best a fair employee of the pizzeria who decides to incite a riot against his own place of employment! Yes we should hire more black guys like that Why did he do it because his friend found the trouble he seemed so desperately in search of. Now to respond to the person below who thought this was a valid thing to do I'd say that's nonsense! What did Sal's Pizzeria have to with the guy getting killed? Nothing. He came into the pizzeria looking for trouble and he got it. Simple. It's his own fault he's dead. With his attitude this guy had the lifeexpectancy of about 2 minutes. Besides why would an employee throw a trash can through his own place of employment? Obviously this film revolted me and I have nothing but contempt for it but I'd have to say the scene when the black people riot was so disturbing I found it difficult to watch. How could anyone offer any praise for this film after seeing that? How can anyone watch that?! And then you've got the catalyst Mookie the lousy employee returning to the scene of his crime. Why you may ask? For his pay! Yeah Sal I started a riot and helped burn down your pizzeria. Now I needs to get paid.I find it very puzzling to say the least that a black man would write and direct a film like this. He made the main black characters look like simple minded idiots! If this were directed by a white man it would be called racist wouldn't it? Personally I couldn't care less. Do The Right Thing is really one of the worst films ever made.".

	schema:reviewBody "I live about two hours away from Seattle where yesterday some big protest was held over WTO meetings that got so out of hand that police had to use tear gas and such to clear the streets from people who were doing things like smashing windows and vandalising and setting fires. Chances are I will bet that most of those people have seen and were probably influenced by Do the Right Thing as were people who caused the LA Riots and probably a lot of other violent protests too. Why? Because to me this movie sort of gives the impression that that sort of thing is okay to do. Sure it shows the trouble that people can experience from itsome businesses get ruined and there is a fatality but it also features the central characters as the ring leaders of the trouble and I don't think these characters are SUPPOSED to be people we don't like or feel foreven though that's what I felt about almost all of them I think they're supposed to be heroes and free spirits engaging in obnoxious behavior which is really sick.Never has a movie disgusted or angered me more than this piece of worthlessness which is most certainly high on my list of worst favorite movies. And this is not simply from the protest at the end either because I was pretty much feeling that way from after about the first five minutes and on after being introduced to about my least favorite cast of characters ever. Basically Do the Right Thing involves a bunch of young punks. One of them is Mookie played by director Spike Lee who works at an Italian pizza place with SalDanny Aiello and his sonsJohn Turturro plays the more promiment oneand hangs out with fellows like Radio Rasheen a creepy thug who blasts terrible music from a radio he takes with him everywhere Smiley a nice retarded fellow with an annoying stutter and Buggin' Outor something like that a beyond obnoxious and beyond loathsome fellow who does not like Sal's pizzaria because he only hangs up pictures of white people. Anyway somewhere along the film Mookie is told by a gent called Da MayorOssie Daviswho old veteren of the slummy neighborhood he lives in that he needs to do the right thing which I guess would mean get his life in gear. That would make it seem like it was going to be some character study completely centering around Mookie but instead the film primarily focusses on about five different subjects Mookie and his job at Sal's Mookie's relationship with his girlfriendthe useless subplot those terrible friends of Mookie and their crusades around the neighborhoodthey try to lobby for that stupid protest and act awful to everyone who passes by some heat wavedon't ask me why and racial issues. Race is a very important issue in this film. The cast is mostly portrayed by people in minority racesAfrican American Italian American Korean Hispanicetcand while this could have been a great film about all races learning to accept each other it instead comes off as a very offensive film about races wanting to stay incredibly exclusive and act hateful to anybody who is not a part of them. It is incredibly ironic that this movie won an award for peace because the right thing is engaging in violence and they don't even make the violence look bad. The audience was probably supposed to be all sympathetic when the fire hoses were turned on but I was so disgusted by the rioting and violence that if those police men had been real I probably would have thanked them or something. I also didn't really mind what they did to Radio Rasheen though I'm sure I was supposed to.And I can go on and on about my dislike for this film but it would probably go long over the 1000 word limit but just trust me this is one to be avoided because even slightly redeeming factors in this movielike Ossie Davis's character get old very quickly. Also anybody who does not care for profanity in movies will be turned off from this one because their are literally hundreds of swear words and I am not exaggerating. A lousy film on all counts.".

The thing that really impressed me about it is the fact that this film isn't a typical Bmovie. In fact this film gives you a very thought provoking story as well as what another person said a kind of poignancy that you never would expect from this type of film. In fact you pretty much feel that towards the end of the film that Marge is actually falling for the alien posing as her beloved Bill. Also you pretty much feel sorry for the impostor at the end as he is beginning to experience the emotions that he never had especially love. Unfortunately the film is undone by its typically lousy 1950's Bmovie title. However once you look past the title and look at how good the story is you will see that this film is a pretty decent film.".

In fact this film gives you a very thought provoking story as well as what another person said a kind of poignancy that you never would expect from this type of film. In fact you pretty much feel that towards the end of the film that Marge is actually falling for the alien posing as her beloved Bill. Also you pretty much feel sorry for the impostor at the end as he is beginning to experience the emotions that he never had especially love. Unfortunately the film is undone by its typically lousy 1950's Bmovie title. However once you look past the title and look at how good the story is you will see that this film is a pretty decent film.";

	schema:reviewBody "With a title this corny I was expecting a lot of laughs a fun Bmovie with Ed Woodstyle filmmaking. Well I got them but that mostly in the beginning. The bulk of the film is quite serious and holds up pretty well even today.The best lines in the opening segments come from Marge Gloria Talbott the one I quoted for the subject head. She said that on her wedding night at the restaurant since her new husband seemed to be ignoring her. You see her hubby had already been taken over by an extraterrestrial being the night before. He just wasn't himself after that.....but who knew? Unfortunately nobody for quite awhile in this story which made life rough for poor Marge Ferrell. The lines in this film weren't just corny. Some of them were downright funny. At the guy's bachelor party which began the show the men had some humorous lines about marriage and freedom and later in the show there are a couple of funny scenes. Later one of Marge friends acts goofy and remarks I just love to rehearse for weddings especially when they are my own! However the story begins to get serious after the first 1015 minutes and gets more and more so after Marge follows her husband one night and sees her oddacting husband is not the man she thought she married. Laser beams and a spaceship will do that to you! From that point it becomes a very familiar story for fans of scifi something we've seen in a lot of films the past 50 years  aliens transform into humans and one that hasn't gets burned by family and friends she trusts because she doesn't realize they too have also turned into aliens.In other words this has a lot of Invasion Of The Body Snatchers type of paranoia story just without the pods. Invasion was released two years earlier than this in 1956. Hollywood lacking imaginative writers the past few decades continues to make films with the same storyline as you see here. but this one can be excused because it was still fairly early in the genre.Thanks to the actors here and a few different twists the movie keeps your attention. The only frustration is to see a person telling the truth and not being believed. Talbott to me was a familiar face because she acted in many television shows in the 1960s while Tyron who got some hype for starring in The Cardinal a bigname film that bombed at the box office wound up being a better writer than an actor. But when it comes to '50s scifi films great acting isn't a requirement anyway and most of us don't watch it for that.Overall this is pretty good nothing super but certainly worth a look now that there is a good DVD transfer of it available. Yes it is far better than the stupid title but still don't take it too seriously  just have fun with it.Note the police captain was played by John Eldredge a regular guest on The Adventures Of Superman in which he almost always played a villain. Also exboxer Maxie Rosenbloom is his normal entertaining self in here playing as usual a bartender.".

However to ignore this movie is cheating oneself since it's a dark creepy and altogether enjoyable scifi about an alien invasion.Bill Ferrell Tryon is out drinking before his wedding day and is overcome by a mysterious dark cloud. Now controlled by aliens he marries Marge Talbott and is determined to populate the earth with alien babies. There's something wrong with the aliens though and they can't breed with earth women. Soon many of the town's men are also controlled by the aliens and Marge can't call telegraph or even leave town with the dreadful news. Eventually the local doctor Ken Lynch has the bright idea to recruit real human men among new dads at the local maternity ward and the aliens are defeated in a pitched battle outside of town.This film has an abundance of wonderful vignettes a local Bgirl tries to pick up one of the aliens a gangster James Anderson is lurking around the Ferrell's house and is eliminated by aliencontrolled policemen an aliencontrolled man dies when he is given oxygen by paramedics after an accident a local bartender punches Bill Ferrell on the jaw repeatedly with no effect and of course the human men overcome the aliens in the climactic battle in a forest.The special effects are truly good for 1958 and Tryonwho usually had the acting range of a statueis very convincing. I think Talbott gave the performance of her career as the woman who is trapped with aliens and has no way out. This film was also the high water mark for character actor Alan Dexter who convincingly plays a sinister alien. Highly recommended despite the title.".

	schema:reviewBody "I can imagine teenagers at the drivein back in 1958. The guys probably anticipated a romantic encounter when the monster jumped out of the bushes and Mary Ellen Rogers jumped into their arms.Sadly for our young romeos everybody in the car was far too engrossed in the flick to do much of anything. As everyone else has commented the title is horrible but the film is a true classic. It's better than Invasion of the Body Snatchers because it personalizes the aliensamongus theme better. Instead of a swinging bachelor like Dr. Bennell we get a young white couple in the suburbs doing everything they're supposed to including being celibate 'till marriage and it all goes to hell. How's THAT for fifties conformity?Ever think you'd see a woman with female problems in a fifties scifi flick? What about the lecherous alkies in the outoftown country club and at the local watering holes? I didn't think those types existed in the fifties. Everything about this film flies in the face of the Eisenhowerera and it does so unapologetically and without remorse... another reason it bests Snatcher a great movie in its own right.Special effects are pretty good. The limited use of them enhances the effectiveness. As a kid these aliens scared the hell out of me because of what I DIDN'T see. I recall watching it when I was about seven or eight on television and for weeks I scanned the side of the road whenever the family traveled to the edge of town. I was on the alert to see the glowing creatures that were ohsoclose to the car just on the side of the road.Writing and direction are tight and Tom Tryon later Gothic novelist is good as the wooden alien but Gloria Talbot is primo as the protagonist. This is really her film and the performance of this late actress was Oscar caliber. Yep it's that good. Again not too many U.S. films had a female heroine as the lead.I hear the new DVD release doesn't have any new information and both Tryon and Talbot are dead so don't look for any interviews. No matter... buy it without shame or embarrassment. This flick still packs a wallop today and I can't imagine what the 1950s sensibilities had to say about the message of the red scare alcoholism there's booze everywhere in this movie infertility and interplanetary sex. It's like an episode of Maury Povich but done with class and style. Despite being on the underbill of I Was A Teenage Werewolf this is NOT A BMOVIE!".

	schema:reviewBody "Despite the fact that this film has a ridiculous title it really is quite a little gem.  During the 1950's  the spread of Communism was the great fear in America and many films reflected this through the analogy of aliens infiltrating society.  This movie is one of them....aliens taking over the population without being noticed....the guy next door may be a Communist or a monster from outer space.  Gloria Talbotwho appeared in a score of 50's movies whatever happened to her? does a good job as the suspicious wife but she wears one of the strangest pointed bras you've ever seen and even wears it in bed!  Tom Tryon sleepwalks through the part of the husband which in this film is appropriate for the role.  He was a very bland actor and eventually went on to a sucessful career as a novelist. The black and white cinematography is well done and the film evokes a sense of impending doom.  The special effects which are limited are not too bad...remember this was 1958.  This film is a standout in a series of lower budget movies of the time but the awkward title may cause some to pass it by. Recommend it to a friend.".

I Married a Monster from Outer Space deals with a woman's fear of entering into a relationship which proves disappointing or even disturbing. Some say the movie is a disguised account of a woman's marriage to a gay man. I'm not sure I'd call the resulting movie a classic but its quiet moody and compassionate quality clearly puts it above most of the noisy specialeffects extravaganzas of today.Gloria Talbot is both persuasive and appealing as the puzzled but faithful wife. None of the shallow comicbook character of Lara Croft here! And the almosttoogoodtobetrue looks of the sexuallyambiguous Tom Tryon are put to effective use as the husband. As usual the film's makers find an excuse to get his shirt off so we can get another look at that muchphotographed torso. In this same scene you'll also spot a barechested Ty Hungerford just before he changed his name to Ty Hardin and became Bronco on the TV series. And no there's nothing sexually ambiguous about Ty. Curiously both men are included in the book Lash! The Hundred Great Scenes of Men Being Whipped in the Movies. Hardin's flogging in a Bronco episode ranks 26th and Tryon's whipping in The Cardinal ranks 46th.".

	schema:reviewBody "The competition of course is fiercer than the top spot on American Idol. But in my warped view I Married a Monster from Outer Space stacks up as the goofiest movie title from an era when goofy movie titles were thicker than scales on Godzilla's monster neck. Naturally there was a reason for those goofy titles. They immediately signaled teen movie which usually meant a drivein special where teens tended to congregate and waste their allowances. But then kids at driveins didn't expect much from their movies because surprise surprise they were too busily engaged in their own hormonal development to catch up with more than bits and pieces.Okay so I didn't see the movie all the way through until years later. But surprise surprise again it's a really good creepy movie that even adults like. And I'm told movie heavyweights catch up with the aliens and their bodysnatched humans for all the symbolism they think they see like does a marriage ceremony turn all husbands into unromantic zombies. I guarantee no teen of the time saw anything on screen other than a good scary movie.Anyway I liked Gloria Talbott then and still do especially when she runs around in her low cut nightgown chest heaving. However I think she made a really bad life choice running into SlapsieMaxie's all night bar in that same gown since it sort of gives the male barflies wrong ideas. But then she's not getting any romance at home because her hubby Tom Tryon is shall we say not of this earth. No instead he's been taken over by a creeping gas cloud that dissolves people for later reassembly in you guessed it a space ship. Talk about bad gas! On the other hand I was really turned off by that scene where the popsicle monster gazes at the doll baby in the window because you know what hesheit whatever is thinking. I don't think sex ed' in highschool prepares you for what to do in case of a randy space creature.So all in all this is a good even if slightly kinky movie that manages to come up with some interesting ideas. Too bad I don't know what they paid dear Gloria but whatever it was she deserved a lot more. She's that good. But pity poor Tom Tryon. He had difficulty giving up his zombie act even in movies where he was supposed to be human. So being the really smart guy he was he put down the actor's part and picked up the writer's pen and became a bestselling author. Okay! so maybe the bad gas was not that bad after all. Anyway if you haven't caught up yet with this slice of 1950's nonsense please do. It's even good enough to watch all the way through.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Fifties were a notable decade for SciFi films. The Cold War was on and there was rampant paranoia about Communism a generalized paranoia that was fueled in a large part by McCarthy and his House UnAmerican Activities Committee. Personal example of the time I was born in the same year as this film was made and I grew up in a house that had been built to my parents' specifications to include a real bomb shelter in its basement. Movies such as the classics Invasion of the Body Snatchers and I Married a Monster From Outer Space played on this theme translated into SciFi films.The sensationalist title belies the quality of the film and its welltold storyline. Although I am also fond of Invasion of the Body Snatchers which has a similar theme it lacks the heart of the subject of this review in my opinion.Marge Gloria Talbott and Bill Tom Tryon are getting married but Marge doesn't realize at first that the night before the wedding her groom's body was taken over by an alien being. She notices the differences in his personality but brushes them aside. She soon comes to realize the true nature of what she has married and of course tries to warn everyone and stop the invasion of aliens...aliens who are taking over the menfolk of her town in the hopes of breeding with the women and establishing a colony on Earth. The theme is They look just like us....but they aren't! And they'll take over! This is Communism as represented by the SciFi genre and it was very popular in the Fifties. The movie industry was feverishly pumping out lots of lowbudget films meant to distract the American public at the local drivein theatre. However I Married a Monster From Outer Space seems to be one of the accidental gems.Tom Tryon makes for a very likable alien. He's tall handsome and manages to make his character very sympathetic as the film progresses. He starts to understand and appreciate Earth its culture and his beautiful wife Marge as she simultaneously pulls away upon discovering that what she is living and sleeping with isn't really her husband. And as always in SciFi the dogs always know who's the alien and who's the human. Marge's present of a dog to Bill results in an episode that jolts her into realizing that something is truly wrong.Subtle performances by both Tryon and Talbott help immensely. Both were highly respected and capable actors of the time and Tryon in particular manages to go from gentle and kind to menacing with a very subtle and believable ease in this film. Tryon was in several wellknown films and received especially good critical reviews for his role in the film The Cardinal. Interesting bit of trivia he was also considered by Alfred Hitchcock for the role of Sam Loomis in Psycho. There are the typical SciFi lowbudget special effects but what makes the film really work is the telling of the story in a manner that pulls you into all of the characters despite the obvious shortcomings of the budget.Note Tom Tryon retired from acting in the late 1960's and became a successful novelist publishing as Thomas Tryon I remember my mother buying some of his books such as the bestselling The Other Harvest Home and Crowned Heads all of which I thoroughly enjoyed.".

	schema:headline " One of the best 1950s sci fi movies a true classic";
	schema:reviewBody "Maligned by many for its title but recognised by most as a movie whose depth entertainment value and chilling moments certainly belie the triteness of the title. Personally I think it's a great title it's like the teenagers from the 'I was a teenage' movies have grown up and are ready for marriage only to discover that there are even greater threats than werewolves and patchwork monsters to contend with. Basically male shape  shifting aliens whose females died out subsequent to a planetary catastrophe have infiltrated a small American town by assuming the appearances and to some extent the characters of local young men with a view to eventually altering female DNA to allow them to bare their offspring. The story focuses for the most part on the plight of newlywed Marge Farrell Gloria Talbott whose husband Bill Tom Tryon is abducted by aliens of the eve of their wedding and replaced by one of them who initially seems like a perfect copy but whose true nature is gradually revealed as Marge's fears and paranoia deepen in a clever commentary on how well we really know people. But there's a lot more to it than that you really need to check it out to see how good it is. Gloria Talbott is great as Marge her deepening crises as she proceeds through feelings of confusion doubt fear acceptance and ultimately recognition of her role in the survival of the 'human' species be it under threat from aliens or communists depending on your perspective are all expertly conveyed and seem to improve with subsequent viewings. Tom Tyron is OK as Bill and does manage to express a kind of detachment that suits the 'not quite there' nature of the character. Gene Fowler's direction is fine except for the day for night work which is unpardonably bad and John Fulton's special effects are great for the time and include such highlights as laser beams and really disgusting melting effects for the eerily glowing aliens. And what about those aliens! For my money they are simply the best aliens of the 1950s big ugly and glowing yet trying to get to grips with the complexities of being human! Stephen King when describing the aliens faces called them 'runnelled and knotted and warty' elsewhere they've simply been described as 'rhubarb like' although one critic dismissed them as 'risible' perhaps he was watching the 'pompous ass' cut of the film I'm sure that critics see a different version of these movies than the rest of us! and they are all of these things and more depending on how you look at them.Some of the themes are interesting even today. Modern day ufologists for example will be very familiar with alien abduction accounts and the notion of emotionless extraterrestrials attempting to cross breed with humans a fairly unusual perspective in the 1950s which from the UFO viewpoint was dominated by the contactee movement. The viewer may also find themselves experiencing mixed feelings towards the aliens. You can easily understand why they want to keep their species going and can to some extent sympathise with their confusion over human emotions but it's hard to reconcile those feelings with the ruthlessness with which they attempt to achieve their goals. Having said that I had no qualms about them killing the sleazy bar fly who was stalking Marge but did feel some pity when the hooker got zapped!Whatever way you decide to view this movie it is in my opinion an absolute gem and fully deserving of 'classic' status. For some reason it doesn't appear to be available on DVD in the UK so I am having to rely on my battered and worn old VHS copy taped years ago when the TV channels here still had the balls to show mad old movies but if you do get the chance to check it out I'm sure you'll agree that this is 1950s American sci fi at its absolute best!".

Personally I think it's a great title it's like the teenagers from the 'I was a teenage' movies have grown up and are ready for marriage only to discover that there are even greater threats than werewolves and patchwork monsters to contend with. Basically male shape  shifting aliens whose females died out subsequent to a planetary catastrophe have infiltrated a small American town by assuming the appearances and to some extent the characters of local young men with a view to eventually altering female DNA to allow them to bare their offspring. The story focuses for the most part on the plight of newlywed Marge Farrell Gloria Talbott whose husband Bill Tom Tryon is abducted by aliens of the eve of their wedding and replaced by one of them who initially seems like a perfect copy but whose true nature is gradually revealed as Marge's fears and paranoia deepen in a clever commentary on how well we really know people. But there's a lot more to it than that you really need to check it out to see how good it is. Gloria Talbott is great as Marge her deepening crises as she proceeds through feelings of confusion doubt fear acceptance and ultimately recognition of her role in the survival of the 'human' species be it under threat from aliens or communists depending on your perspective are all expertly conveyed and seem to improve with subsequent viewings. Tom Tyron is OK as Bill and does manage to express a kind of detachment that suits the 'not quite there' nature of the character. Gene Fowler's direction is fine except for the day for night work which is unpardonably bad and John Fulton's special effects are great for the time and include such highlights as laser beams and really disgusting melting effects for the eerily glowing aliens. And what about those aliens! For my money they are simply the best aliens of the 1950s big ugly and glowing yet trying to get to grips with the complexities of being human! Stephen King when describing the aliens faces called them 'runnelled and knotted and warty' elsewhere they've simply been described as 'rhubarb like' although one critic dismissed them as 'risible' perhaps he was watching the 'pompous ass' cut of the film I'm sure that critics see a different version of these movies than the rest of us! and they are all of these things and more depending on how you look at them.Some of the themes are interesting even today. Modern day ufologists for example will be very familiar with alien abduction accounts and the notion of emotionless extraterrestrials attempting to cross breed with humans a fairly unusual perspective in the 1950s which from the UFO viewpoint was dominated by the contactee movement. The viewer may also find themselves experiencing mixed feelings towards the aliens. You can easily understand why they want to keep their species going and can to some extent sympathise with their confusion over human emotions but it's hard to reconcile those feelings with the ruthlessness with which they attempt to achieve their goals. Having said that I had no qualms about them killing the sleazy bar fly who was stalking Marge but did feel some pity when the hooker got zapped!Whatever way you decide to view this movie it is in my opinion an absolute gem and fully deserving of 'classic' status. For some reason it doesn't appear to be available on DVD in the UK so I am having to rely on my battered and worn old VHS copy taped years ago when the TV channels here still had the balls to show mad old movies but if you do get the chance to check it out I'm sure you'll agree that this is 1950s American sci fi at its absolute best!";

Looking for a planet with life and to be able reproduce their people the earth was one of the few planets available to them. But they made a fatal miscalculation in both the human race and themselves. The aliens lacked any human feeling which is needed to attract a woman to fall in love with and thus marry and have childrenthem. They were also not adapted to breath the oxygen on earth which turned out to be fatal to the aliens. Most off all they were rendered sterile by the massive doses of radiations that they absorbed on their home planet from their dying and later exploding sun. Much better then you would expect the movie I Married a Monster from Outer Space has a intelligent script and fine acting on the part of it's cast. It makes you interested not only in the people on earth that are being targeted for this grand plan on the part of the aliens but the aliens themselves in their attempt to save their race from extinction. The movie also makes you sympathetic to the aliens by realizing that their trying to do what any people would do the save themselves. By being able to sire future generations through mating with the women on earth.The movie does take a violent turn when the aliens disguised as human beings are beginning to be exposed by Marge. Marge tries to warn her girlfriend Helen Jean Carson not to marry her faence Sam Benson Alan Dexter because he's one of the aliens like her husband Bill! Still she's not believed by anyone in town but only by the aliens like her husband Bill who try to keep Marge quite as well as anyone else who would suspect them. The ending of the movie was in a way a bit sad with all the aliens from the scout ship destroyed by the townspeople and two brave German Shepherd dogs since you could never really dislike them knowing that they warn't really evil. The aliens were just trying to do what any living entity human being includedwould try to do. Save their race from becoming extinct and thus have the audience overlook the fact they they were what they were Invaders from Space trying to take over and conquer a foreign planet and for loss of a better word rape it's human female inhabitants.".

There are times when an actor will start a scene normally and abruptly slow in midstep as if reminded off camera to slow down. I also mean that the things that do happen lack substance for the most part scenes of the alien demonstrating his superior strength by crushing a can or glass. The music is thankfully sparse since when they do play music it often contradicts the mood on screen... light upbeat music during tense suspenseful moments confuses the mood. The motivation behind the invasion is kept from the audience for most of the movie I think it was meant to be a shocking reveal and it probably was in the 50's but audiences now will be too jaded. The ending picks up a bit but it's rather late in the movie by which point Tom Tryon's wooden acting pouting facial expression slow movements and slow dialog had worn me out.With no tension no drama and little suspense I recommend skipping I Married a Monster from Outer Space and watching or rewatching any one of the better scifi films of the fifties.".

Its glossy production values courtesy of MGM do not get in the way of the director's pacing or the heightening of suspense. The actual story itself  with tiny shrunken people being used to carry out dastardly deeds in Paris  is quite absurd but the cast is so good and the direction so able that the viewer can simply sit back and enjoy the results.Lionel Barrymore one of America's greatest character actors has a field day in the lead role and is actually quite compelling dressed as an elderly lady hobbling about like an authentic beldame. It would not be long before he would be confined to a wheelchair by crippling arthritis but with his excellent voice and piercing eyes Barrymore would scarcely be handicapped as an actor. Here he is a positive menace cooing  consoling his intended victims before sending the devildolls  controlled by his mind  to finish the job of retribution.Fragile  ailing Silent Film star Henry B. Walthall would be dead before THE DEVILDOLL could be released. Nonetheless he still manages to give a powerful performance as a deranged scientist who has discovered how to reduce living things to one sixth their original size. Walthall's desperate eagerness over his researches replicates the dying actor's desperation to communicate with his audience. Equally formidable is Italian actress Rafaela Ottiano as Walthall's widow feverishly continuing her husband's weird experiments. Her insane eyes and sinister mien making her resemble Frankenstein's Bride give the film some of its spookiest moments.Rotund Robert Greig appears as one of Barrymore's victims gentle Lucy Beaumont plays Barrymore's mother. Maureen O'Sullivan  Frank Lawton reunited once again after DAVID COPPERFIELD 1935 nicely fill the requisite roles of the young lovers.Movie mavens will recognize Eily Malyon as a meantempered laundress  Billy Gilbert as a butler both uncredited.Erich von Stroheim brilliant  obsessive was one of the screenwriters on this project. The special effects in the scenes involving the tiny people are quite well managed.".

There is a nice emotional center of the film  Barrymore's daughter has suffered a lot from her father's crimes and she hates him. Barrymore's sole purpose in getting revenge and getting his enemies to confess their crimes is to free his daughter from the shame in which she has always lived because of him.

Not only was he an escaped con trying to exact revenge but much of the movie he disguised himself as an old lady!

	schema:headline " An excellent tale of murder and vengeance";
	schema:reviewBody "While he is famous for being the mind behind Universal's 1931 horror classic Dracula director Tod Browning is also often labeled as another of the director who struggled the most when the invention of movies with sound arrived to cinema smashing the careers of many professionals of the silent medium. One of the best American directors of silents Browning did struggle with talkies but thanks to the enormous success of Dracula found himself in a very good position. Sadly Freaks his next film became so controversial that he lost the favor of the audience and the studios who were not ready to the tale of the love between a midget and a normal woman. While he managed to recover from this he never had again the commercial success of Dracula a real shame because in 1936 he directed the film that finally proved that he had understood the benefits of the new sound era The DevilDoll.In this film Lionel Barrymore plays Paul Lavond a former banker who was wrongfully accused of fraud and sent to prison for 17 years. In prison he meets another convict named Marcel Henry B. Walthall an odd scientist who becomes his friend and plan their escape together. After escaping they hide in Marcel's house where Lavond discovers that Marcel and his wife Malita Rafaela Ottiano invented a way to minimize objects in an attempt to reduce people in order to save space and food. Sadly the process damages the brains of living beings reducing them to puppets who can be easily controlled with the mind. Lavond is at first horrified by this insanity but after the sudden death of Marcel he decides to help Malita if she agrees to help him in his revenge. Now disguised as an innocent old lady Lavond returns to Paris with his devilish living dolls decided to make those who send him to prison pay for every year he spent without his family.The story was written by Browning himself giving his very own spin to the plot of Abraham Merritt's novel Burn Witch Burn however the screenplay was done by Guy Endore Garrett Fort and Erich Von Stroheim so actually very few remains from Merritt's novel in the movie and it's truly more a Browning film. As usual in his stories Browning focuses on the misadventures of an outcast in this case Paul Lavond who while being the hero of the story has to resort to brutal crimes to achieve his vengeance almost like a horror retelling of The Count of Montecristo. The story unfolds nicely and despite being more than 70 years old it still feels fresh and original. This is definitely because the characters of the film are so very well developed that truly feel and act like real complex persons despite the fantasy elements of the story.Now the true surprise of the film is definitely Tod Browning's effective direction of the whole thing. While he is revered for his work in Dracula and Freaks most critics and fans tend to agree that his best work happened in the silent era as those films as well as Mark of the Vampire have their best scenes in the silent parts. Well this movie proves that idea wrong as not only The DevilDoll is heavily based on dialog it is remarkably wellexecuted and is definitely on par with most of Browning's best silent films. As usual Browning mixes horror and black comedy in a delightful subtle way even referencing his own classic The Unholy Three in occasions. Finally it must also be pointed out that in this film Browning crafts truly impressive scenes with special effects that still look awe inspiring even today.Of course not everything is about Browning as certainly without his superb cast the final result would be very different. Lionel Barrymore is simply amazing as Paul Levond portraying the tragic figure of the good man consumed by hate forced to commit crimes to clean his name. Barrymore was a master of his craft and he proves it in the scenes where he must disguise himself as an old lady. Maureen O'Sullivan and Frank Lawton fresh from Cukor's version of David Copperfield are reunited again playing Lavond's daughter and the man in love with her. The two of them are very natural but is O'Sullivan's talent the one that shines the most. Italian actress Rafaela Ottiano gives a very good and scary performance although the fact that Barrymore's character is the focus of the film limits her screen time quite a lot. Overall the cast is pretty effective and one of the main reasons of the movie's high quality.It's a shame that Browning's career was considered beyond redemption after the huge commercial failure of the misunderstood Freaks as this movie proves that there was still a lot in Browning to give after mastering the craft of making talkies. While it's hard to deny the importance and value of both Dracula and Freaks it is only in this movie where Browning shows a true understanding of the new technology as while the movie is still very visual it's at its core a very dialog oriented film and Browning demonstrates he can handle it. While the story has that feeling of being taken straight from a pulp novel it's very emotional and dramatic without being overtly sappy and it could be said that it's in this movie where Browning finally combines the best of both worlds.Like most people I too used to believe that Browning's best days happened along Lon Chaney during the years of the silent era however The DevilDoll is a film that has made me reconsider that thought as this movie has everything that made Browning great in the silents as well as his full domination of the new technology. While definitely nowhere near Dracula or Freaks this is a talkie that shows him at his best. 810".

	schema:headline " Browning's second to last film is very entertaining";
	schema:reviewBody "The career of Tod Browning was too short and he only made one more film after this and it's a terrific showcase for Lionel Barrymore. This story is about two escapee's from Devils Island and Barrymore is Paul Lavond and he was found guilty and sentenced to 17 years in prison after being setup by his business partners. He follows his friend Marcel Henry B. Walthall to where his wife is living and after eluding the police and their dogs they finally arrive. Marcel's wife is Malita Rafaela Ottiano and she has been continuing the scientific experiments that they both have started years before. Paul learns that they have figured out a way to shrink animals and people to the size of dolls and can make them move and do things with will power. But one night Marcel dies of a heart attack and Malita persuades Paul to help her with her experiments. Paul agrees and see's this as a chance to get revenge on those responsible for his incarceration. They travel to Paris France but they have to be careful because the police expect Paul to show up. Paul dresses up as an old woman and calls himself Madame Mandelip and he opens a small toy shop with Malita. Paul is able to see his mother while in disguise but he has a daughter who doesn't recognize him. Maureen O'Sullivan is Lorraine and she hates her father but doesn't realize that he's really innocent. SPOILER ALERTThis is certainly not on the same level as Dracula but it's still a very entertaining film and Lionel Barrymore is a joy to watch. Tod Browning always had a good eye for talent and Barrymore was a star on Broadway and more than able to tackle this role. I have to admit that when he's dressed in drag he's fairly convincing but his old lady voice becomes a little tiresome. Barrymore was much more versatile than a lot of the roles he had to play on film. I'm sure his best performances were in the theater and he was just a natural as an actor. O'Sullivan is not in this film enough and she really has only one good scene and it's where she lets out her rage when talking about her father. The big gripe I had with this film is that its suppose to be in Paris. It's obviously not and everyone speaks English Lets go to the Eiffel Tower. The film ends with a much more upbeat note than what we would expect considering what Barrymore does to exact revenge. A lot of films would have had the protagonist meet some sort of fate but Browning doesn't seem interested in that. Browning wrote this script with Erich von Stroheim and there is some good tension built up in certain scenes and one that stands out is where one of the businessmen stares at the clock and when he's about to meet his fate he stands up and confesses his guilt. Ottiano visibly resembles the Bride of Frankenstein with the streak in her hair and she spends most of her performance looking wide eyed and wearing pancake makeup. She's a lot of fun to watch in this film and the strength of her persona is very evident as you watch this. Not exactly a great film but one that does offer a very good performance by Barrymore.".

This story is about two escapee's from Devils Island and Barrymore is Paul Lavond and he was found guilty and sentenced to 17 years in prison after being setup by his business partners. He follows his friend Marcel Henry B. Walthall to where his wife is living and after eluding the police and their dogs they finally arrive. Marcel's wife is Malita Rafaela Ottiano and she has been continuing the scientific experiments that they both have started years before. Paul learns that they have figured out a way to shrink animals and people to the size of dolls and can make them move and do things with will power. But one night Marcel dies of a heart attack and Malita persuades Paul to help her with her experiments. Paul agrees and see's this as a chance to get revenge on those responsible for his incarceration. They travel to Paris France but they have to be careful because the police expect Paul to show up. Paul dresses up as an old woman and calls himself Madame Mandelip and he opens a small toy shop with Malita. Paul is able to see his mother while in disguise but he has a daughter who doesn't recognize him. Maureen O'Sullivan is Lorraine and she hates her father but doesn't realize that he's really innocent. SPOILER ALERTThis is certainly not on the same level as Dracula but it's still a very entertaining film and Lionel Barrymore is a joy to watch. Tod Browning always had a good eye for talent and Barrymore was a star on Broadway and more than able to tackle this role. I have to admit that when he's dressed in drag he's fairly convincing but his old lady voice becomes a little tiresome. Barrymore was much more versatile than a lot of the roles he had to play on film. I'm sure his best performances were in the theater and he was just a natural as an actor. O'Sullivan is not in this film enough and she really has only one good scene and it's where she lets out her rage when talking about her father. The big gripe I had with this film is that its suppose to be in Paris. It's obviously not and everyone speaks English Lets go to the Eiffel Tower. The film ends with a much more upbeat note than what we would expect considering what Barrymore does to exact revenge. A lot of films would have had the protagonist meet some sort of fate but Browning doesn't seem interested in that. Browning wrote this script with Erich von Stroheim and there is some good tension built up in certain scenes and one that stands out is where one of the businessmen stares at the clock and when he's about to meet his fate he stands up and confesses his guilt. Ottiano visibly resembles the Bride of Frankenstein with the streak in her hair and she spends most of her performance looking wide eyed and wearing pancake makeup. She's a lot of fun to watch in this film and the strength of her persona is very evident as you watch this. Not exactly a great film but one that does offer a very good performance by Barrymore.";

He plays a desperate escaped convict who hides by masquerading as a kindly old woman who in turn pretends to be maker of perfectly detailed dolls.

	schema:reviewBody "Director Tod Browning just wasn't drawn to normal people. His movies are often set in circuses and carnivals or else involve criminals who take on weird or grotesque disguises. Deception of one kind or another is a common theme in his films. Some find his movies to be profound commentaries on the human condition others see them as just weird. I see Browning as a unique film artist. As to the extent of his genius it's hard for me to gauge. There's no one else quite like him. Whenever I'm watching a Browning picture I'm inevitably more thrilled by the ideas behind it than I am by the film itself. The Devil Doll concerns a man framed for a crime he didn't commit who is sent to Devil's Island where he learns the black art of shrinking people to the size of mice from an inventor. He escapes from the island and returns to Paris where he proceeds to extract his revenge on those who sent him away. There's a lot of plot in this one far more than I just outlined and the movie has on occasion a VictorianDickensian feeling aided in no small measure by the casting of Maureen O'Sullivan and Frank Lawton who had just appeared in the movie of David Copperfield as the romantic leads. Lionel Barrymore is the star and still quite capable of getting around and delivers a fine performance alternately sympathetic and diabolical. This is not a fastpaced or exciting movie by today's standards but it has its virtues most of them pictorial. The special effects are superb and the elfpeople uncannily persuasive.".

The story concerns Paul Lavond played by the always awesome Lionel Barrymore  an escaped prisoner who learns a way to shrink humans to 16th their size and rob them of their free will. He uses this secret to enact revenge on the men who framed him and sent him to prison.Like his other films this Tod Browning film also started a bit of a subgenre in the horror field  no I'm not talking about creepy dolls though a case could perhaps be made for that I'm talking about the wronged individual that seeks redress in a vengeful manner sure earlier films danced around the concept  notably 'The Phantom of the Opera'  but here it is so straightforward. Lavond openly admits that he is full of hatred vengeance and even evil. That is very refreshing even in a film that's over 70 years old! Lavond realizes that he will ultimately pay a heavy price for his actions but never wavers in his conviction to see his plans fully realized. Many great films in the genre followed this formula later on notably 'The Abominable Dr. Phibes'.Another great aspect to this film is the great supporting cast. Maureen O'Sullivan Jane from the Tarzan films! as Lavond's daughter and character actress Rafaela Ottiano creepy as always as Lavond's accomplice.Definitely worth a watch.".

It was somewhat surprising that that situation wasn't resolved at the finale other than for Lorraine's memory of her father to be cleansed of the hate she felt for so long.

	schema:headline " Deeper and more complex than it has any right to be a masterpiece from Todd Browning";
	schema:reviewBody "Todd Browning is most famous for strange films such as Freaks and The Unknown but the strangest thing about this film is actually not the subject material it's the way everything comes together. Looking at this film on paper would easily lead any sane person into thinking that its going to be a great big mess but somehow Todd Browning has pulled together ideas including a criminal on the run a mad science project to shrink every living thing in the world transvestism and a story about a man wanting to reconcile with the daughter who hates him and created a masterpiece out of it! The plot focuses on Paul Lavond a man wrongly accused of robbery and sent to Devil's Island. He manages to escape along with a friend of his a mad scientist who has discovered a way to shrink living things with the idea of having less food consumed in mind. Lavond seizes an opportunity to use this discovery to get his own back on those who framed him and at the same time clear his name so his only daughter won't hate his memory.The film is extremely entertaining to watch Browning keeps things going with a real verve and since there's so much diversity on display things simply don't have chance to get boring. When the film finished I knew I'd enjoyed it thoroughly but it's not until I stepped back and started to think about the film that I realised what a masterpiece it is! Browning weaves his web with great skill and frankly unrelated plots fit together seamlessly. The lead character Paul Lavond at first appears to be a dastardly opportunist but through this story of revenge and shrunken people his character develops and by the end we not only like the character  but actually understand and respect his actions throughout the film! Yes we understand and respect why he had to use shrunken people for revenge. For what at first appears to be a silly horror film that is a real achievement. The lead character is brought to life by Lionel Barrymore a very talented actor that leads the film brilliantly both as leading man and his alterego Madame Mandelip! There's so much more going on than just the central story too Rafaela Ottiano's delightfully twisted sidekick Malita is the pick of Browning's sideshows. The DevilDoll is liable to be brushed aside by many for the silliness of its central plot but if you look a little deeper you'll surely find a complex little story that works much better than it has any right to. I would not hesitate to HIGHLY recommend this film to anyone that loves their offthewall cinema!".

Another plus is that believe it or not the special effects still hold up after seventy years.Lionel Barrymore in his most unusual role displays tremendous talent and versatility. He even makes his advanced arthritis condition work for him as his crippled bent posture and slow walking ability he would soon become caneusing and wheelchairbound add to his uncanny portrayal of an elderly woman. He sort of looks and sounds like his own sister in her later years but anyway it really works.The musical score is not much in evidence but if you get a chance to hear a modern CD performance of it you will note that Waxman created a sophisticated waltzthemed work. Its complicated lilting structure that first ascends then ends with several descending series of notes is brilliant especially if played at faster tempo. It is subtly elegant and appropriate for this film.Sheer talent and high creativity elevate this film to an 8 out of 10 rating on my scale.".

I give this movie a perfect 10 because all of the movies I've seen by Browning have been horrifically awesome just to bad that he didn't make more than he did. So my message to everyone who likes the old horror movies from the 30's then this is a movie you could not turn down by any means get your hands on this while you can because its very good and very atmospheric at times as well. One last thing about this movie is that it is tragic all the way through. Even the ending is tragic but then again it's compelling and emotional in a good way I never really got it of what I felt a the ending but I'm glad I saw this movie because its a really good movie for classic horror movie lovers".

	schema:reviewBody "This was one of the last few classic horror films of the 30s that I had not yet seen so I was looking forward to viewing what I hoped would be another golden era fright flick. This was especially true as I am a big fan of Tod Browning's work and would consider most of his films to be among from favorites. Sadly I was pretty disappointed in the movie overall and became another reminder of why other studios just weren't able to compete with Universal in this time period.The movie starts off promising. Two convicts escape from jail and retreat to a home in the swamp owned by one of the men. Here his wife has been continuing the scientific experiments that he'd begun before his imprisonment. The idea was to miniaturize people so that we would consume less resources therefore making it one of the first earth conscious movies I can remember. The other convict is played by Lionel Barrymore who is bent on revenge against the three men who set him up on false charges to steal his fortune. When the scientist dies his wife is determined to finish his research and enlists Barrymore who sees this as an opportunity to enact his revenge so off to Paris they go to fulfill the master plan.My biggest issue with the movie starts with the character played by Barrymore. The police are searching for him and assume he's returned to Paris so he is forced to go incognito. This involves him dressing in drag and taking on the false identity of an old matron. As the main character who takes up the majority of the screen time Barrymore is exceedingly annoying in this role. The false female falsetto he employs is grating to listen to for an entire movie and rather than being any kind of effective villain to carry the thriller the viewer ends up longing for any scene that won't involve this caricature. Those scenes are just as dull though. This movie is much longer than the standard horror film of the time and suffers for it. There is far too much padding and most of it involves a trite story about Barrymore's estranged daughter and his attempts to reconcile the life he's left for her. We also get a standard clich romance between his daughter and her beau Toto a cab driver who's trying to make a better life for them. The end result is far too much run time playing out plots that needed to be trimmed out and not nearly enough time devoted to the revenge plot that should have been the central premise.The actual revenge involves Barrymore utilizing these miniature people to carry out his plots as he tries to prove his innocence and bring down his enemies. We've all seen plenty of horror movies that use miniature people or dolls to chilling effect. There is something naturally unsettling about seeing something like a doll being used as a force of evil. Here though there is very little scary about them. Instead they are more used as little sneaks to steal things or prick people with miniature knives. This is far from something like the doll in TRILOGY OF TERROR or CAT'S EYE.I will give a lot of credit for the special effects used to create the mini people and animals. They must have been mindblowing to an audience at the time and still hold up fairly well despite being able to see some cracks in the design during certain scenes when it doesn't translate as well.There was a great idea in here somewhere that probably could have been pulled off much more effectively were the script to utilize Barrymore more in his IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE villain persona and far less as an annoying crossdresser.".

As we can see our vengeance obsessed main character may be an antagonist but is not really a villain. His love for his daughter and mother comes through strongly and with an actor as compulsively watchable as Lionel Barrymore in the lead the movie is certainly easy enough to follow.Barrymore plays Paul Lavond a banker framed by his partners and sent up the river who at the beginning of the movie breaks out of Devil's Island prison in the company of a persecuted scientist Marcel Henry B. Walthall who's devised what he thinks is the answer to the worlds' hunger problem shrink everybody and everything so that the quantity of the worlds' food will then amount to more. The thing Marcel and his wife Malita Rafaela Ottiano are clearly mad and despite Pauls' own misgivings about their actions yes our antagonist does have some morals he's still okay with using them towards his own ends.This leads to some fairly well realized sequences in which miniaturized dogs horses and people are controlled by masters such as Barrymore. The sequences in which Lachna Grace Ford and Radin Arthur Hohl go about particular missions are entertaining every step of the way. In general the film is a little talky and never terribly scary but Browning does generate some palpable suspense and in one great moment as the clock is ticking the character Matin Pedro de Cordoba feels his conscience getting to him. Maureen O'Sullivan as Lavonds' daughter Lorraine and Frank Lawton as ambitious and cheery taxi driver Toto ! make for an appealing couple. But getting to watch the interesting Mr. Barrymore at work is really the main reason to watch The DevilDoll especially as he dresses in drag as Lavond masquerades as a doddering old character named Miss Mandilip.Set in Paris and scripted by Garrett Fort Guy Endore and Erich von Stroheim this does have solid atmosphere going for it as well as an affecting emotional ending. This may not be quite as memorable as Brownings' other works but is worth a look for fans of genre films from this period.Seven out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Most fellow lovers of Classic Horror or Classic Cinema in general should agree that Tod Browning was doubtlessly an outstanding director of unique and exceptional Horror classics. My personal favorite film by this great director will always be his incomparably brilliant Freaks of 1932 which as far as I am considered ranks among the greatest films ever made. Browning has created a whole bunch of other masterpieces too however such as his doubtlessly most famous film the original 1931 Dracula starring the great Bela Lugosi Mark Of The Vampire 1935 The Unknown 1927 or this magnificent little film The DevilDoll of 1936. While this is not as wellknown as Dracula or Freaks The DevilDoll is yet a highly memorable classic with an ingenious storyline and a very intense often mesmerizing atmosphere.Paul Lavand Lionell Barrymore a formerly respected Paris banker has innocently spent many years in a Devil's Island prison. Driven by the desire for revenge Lavand escapes with a fellow inmate a scientist Henry B. Walthall who has achieved a technology that allows to shrink animals and humans to miniature size... The film is often described as being 'goofy' or 'camp' but these descriptions are not really justified. Granted some elements of the story are a bit farfetched but who cares  it all works perfectly in the context of the film and the outcome is a fascinating and ingenious cinematic experience that cineastes should not deny themselves. The great Lionell Barrymore fits perfectly in the leading role of Paul Lavand and the rest of the cast also deliver very good performances. Henry B. Walthall is very good in his role of the scientist and Rafaela Ottianno who plays the scientist's equally dedicated wife is especially memorable. Also beautiful Maureen O'Sullivan was perfectly cast as Paul Lavand's innocent daughter. The most ingenious aspect about The DevilDoll however is the mesmerizing atmosphere as well as the ingenious special effects which are truly amazing considering the time this was made. Overall The DevilDoll is another ingenious film by Tod Browning and sadly his second to last as for some reason he quit the film business in 1939 22 years before his death in 1962. Highly recommended to all my fellow fans of Classic Horror and to filmbuffs in general. 910".

	schema:headline " A Missed Opportunity";
	schema:reviewBody "The film opens with a rather strange juxtaposition of two scenes. One features a group of grieving parents discussing how they have dealt with the loss of their children. The other features a topless stripper playing with fire. The Crossing Guard at its heart is how people deal with grief differently and the consequences those choices have for all. Some parents would prefer to pour their heart out. Others choose more destructive outlets like patronize strip clubs. Jack Nicholson the father of a girl killed by a drunk driver spends some of his nights at strip clubs while Anjelica Huston the mother of that girl and Nicholson's exwife spends time listening to those grief stricken parents pouring their hearts out. Like that opening juxtaposition the film's points are hit with all the nuance of a sledgehammer pounding in a nail.Therefore little attention is paid to how Huston's character attempts to come to terms with the death of her child instead the focus is on how Nicholson destructively grieves for his daughter. Of course he wants revenge. And of course this quest for revenge the film tells us doesn't solve anything but only further eats away at him.Nicholson who still seems to be in Joker mode from his stint in that role in the Batman franchise is as over the top as one might expect. The character he's saddled with is a difficult one to play to be sure but Nicholson makes his character so over bearing and indignant that his presence soon becomes toxic. Instead of exploring his character's inner grief and psychology the film would rather just show his temper tantrums. David Morse as the drunk driver who killed Nicholson's daughter is by contrast and surprisingly shown as some kind of repentant saint. He knows what he did feels terrible about it and tries to communicate it to an obstinate Nicholson. But in general Morse isn't given much to do other than stare into space stoically. Huston however it must be said is quite good even if the film doesn't really care about her and only utilizes her to show how crazy Nicholson's character has become.The middle part of the film where Nicholson parties with some strippers including Three's Company's Priscilla Barnes and Morse's character meets up with some bohemians is a total bore. Another subplot of Morse falling in love with Robin Wright Penn adds nothing to the plot other than act as filler so the film can reach the standard 120 minute run time. Finally the closing sequence of the film which includes a chase or in Nicholson's case a fast walk through LA and ends with a kumbaya moment in a graveyard as the sun is slowly rising and the tedious score swelling is totally ridiculous. What's most disappointing here is that at its core The Crossing Guard could have been a good film. Sean Penn has directed other fine films especially Into the Wild and Nicholson at least prior to the '90s is a firstrate actor. But totally lacking nuance in performance and story and weighed down by a miserable second half and a hokey conclusion renders this film instead largely a failure.".

Like that opening juxtaposition the film's points are hit with all the nuance of a sledgehammer pounding in a nail.Therefore little attention is paid to how Huston's character attempts to come to terms with the death of her child instead the focus is on how Nicholson destructively grieves for his daughter. Of course he wants revenge. And of course this quest for revenge the film tells us doesn't solve anything but only further eats away at him.Nicholson who still seems to be in Joker mode from his stint in that role in the Batman franchise is as over the top as one might expect. The character he's saddled with is a difficult one to play to be sure but Nicholson makes his character so over bearing and indignant that his presence soon becomes toxic. Instead of exploring his character's inner grief and psychology the film would rather just show his temper tantrums. David Morse as the drunk driver who killed Nicholson's daughter is by contrast and surprisingly shown as some kind of repentant saint. He knows what he did feels terrible about it and tries to communicate it to an obstinate Nicholson. But in general Morse isn't given much to do other than stare into space stoically. Huston however it must be said is quite good even if the film doesn't really care about her and only utilizes her to show how crazy Nicholson's character has become.The middle part of the film where Nicholson parties with some strippers including Three's Company's Priscilla Barnes and Morse's character meets up with some bohemians is a total bore. Another subplot of Morse falling in love with Robin Wright Penn adds nothing to the plot other than act as filler so the film can reach the standard 120 minute run time. Finally the closing sequence of the film which includes a chase or in Nicholson's case a fast walk through LA and ends with a kumbaya moment in a graveyard as the sun is slowly rising and the tedious score swelling is totally ridiculous. What's most disappointing here is that at its core The Crossing Guard could have been a good film. Sean Penn has directed other fine films especially Into the Wild and Nicholson at least prior to the '90s is a firstrate actor. But totally lacking nuance in performance and story and weighed down by a miserable second half and a hokey conclusion renders this film instead largely a failure.";

	schema:reviewBody "It's hard to find a Jack Nicholson movie where he acts so poorly that it bothers the viewer. But here is the needle in the haystack.Nicholson's performance is overacted uninspired and adolescent. And as if that wasn't bad enough Anjelica Huston seems to follow suit! It's almost as if there was a badacting virus on the set.However one actor who had apparently been vaccinated was David Morse. This is probably the one and only bright spot in the movie. Morse is fantastic. His portrayal of John Booth is convincing multidimensional and consistent. It is twice as amazing that Morse was able to pull off such an impressive job when one considers that he had to play off the pitiful Nicholson. Robin Wright did give Morse at least something to work with as her performance was fairly good although hampered by the story.....which brings us to the worst aspect of the moviethe screenplay. Imagine a story called The hammer hits the nail where viewers are forced to watch an ultraslomo of a hammer coming down on a nail periodically broken up by sporadic unnecessary banter and you have this in a nutshell. The story is painfully predictable and morbidly slowmoving. One walks away saying That was it? But I already knew that. The actual story should only take about 5 minutes. The rest is filler. And bad filler.The climax of the movie if one can call it that is a pathetically unrealistic chase scene where the outofshape 50something smoking alcoholic character played by Nicholson out runs the young muscular and fit Morse over a distance of some 3 miles or so although it seems like 20 miles to the viewer. Nothing is given away by this description however since most viewers already know how a movie like this will end.The title of the film The Crossing Guard is of course irrelevant to all but selfdescribed film experts who have infinite time and desire to conjure up the real meaning of films and teach them to the rest of us. However it most likely refers to the tragic failure of a talentguard to catch this script before it made it to production.".

Where 21 Grams was a Hollywoodversion of addiction The Crossing Guard is a Hollywoodversion of crime and punishment. There is no clear villain and there is no clear victim. I guess we are all victims aren't we Sean? Okay first of all why did Booth get out of prison for killing a girl while drunk driving and his friends throw him a welcome home party with alcohol being served? Only in Hollywood. We are given a small glimpse of Booth's character but not enough to really feel bad for him. Nicholson's character Gale is a real creep. He makes it pretty tough to feel sorry for him at all. So the viewer is torn right up until the end of the movie. The ending throws you for an emotional roller coaster that will make some people laugh and no doubt make others cry but it is definitely strange. A frantic Gale shooting Booth then handing his gun over to him.Fine acting fine directing just not a great story here. Then there was Robin Wright. We loved you in The Princess Bride but please Sean cool it with the nepotism the part was useless and your lovely wife did not fit into it.5 out of 10 kids.".

Other than Kari the movie's highlight is a short fragment from the rare Jewel song Emily.The Crossing Guard is dedicated to Bukowski an appropriate nod given the predilections of the Nicholson character.";

First Sean Penn tries to pack as many bare chested ladies into the story as possible with little bearing on the story line.  Robin Wright's performance is possibly the most overdramatized role I have ever seen. Who believed that she fell so hard for an exconvict in one night?  The story was so melodramatic that I rolled my eyes more than once.  Not even the great Jack Nicholson could save this movie as his role was overplayed and far far below his standards.  But you have to give Sean Penn credit for the ending.  Of the dozens of choices he had for closing this film he did pick the very worst one.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sean Penn can be a great actor but with the Crossing Guard he displays a hit or miss attitude in the believability of his characters. It starts with a given for a gripping premise a man torn completely psychologically from himself Freddy Jack Nicholson finds out the man who killed his daughter in a drunk driving accident is released from prison after only six years. And he'll go and kill him. Why he'll kill him also a psychological pull is that he's more so for his exwife Mary Angelica Huston than he is for himself. It's as much if not more about pride than it is about vengeance. But through this premise and the divide between selfdestructive drunk Freddy and the guiltridden morose John Booth Penn paints his characters sometimes into corners even when things become most intriguing. It's appropriate I suppose that Penn decided to dedicate the film to Charles Bukowski as it probably alludes a lot to the moods of the characters in those books. But in putting across moods so much he almost forgets that his actors need believable circumstances to follow. One device for example is the whole you got three days angle Freddy pulls with John when he first confronts him in his trailer. There's also the sort of romanceinlimbo between John and another woman Robin Wright Penn.But what I didn't expect was that the actors almost don't but ultimately do rise above the contrivances of the script. There's even a great scene between Nicholson and Huston in a restaurant the night the murder is supposed to take place. Scenes like this and a tearridden phone call from Freddy in a redtinted room are powerful and connect with the overall theme of loss in the film. Yet as a director Penn doesn't pull enough with his characters and mood to make it as compelling as it can be. He also relies on some fairly arty camera moves to make it more interesting when they aren't needed anyway. Nicholson and Morse meanwhile are consummate pros who get into their characters completely and for Nicholson especially it's almost a walk in the park with his motivation less about the death of his daughter than it is about decay itself. But what is the audience to make of the mediocre decision to have Freddy get pulled over by the cops on his way to kill John for drunk driving and then go into a very farfetched chase from them to catch up to John just so the irony can be placed in? It's not that the actors don't use some devices either at their disposal.However in the case of the Crossing Guard no matter how deeply felt Penn is to his material leading up to a somewhat meaningful ending at the cemetery he doesn't give it all to actors who demand more from him. I also think having seen this after seeing the Pledge a brilliant drama with many of the same themes of redemption from another's death and loss from it all rises so much more above similar ground in this picture. Not bad but not great either sort of an unfulfilled if always watchable middleground. B".

Mary has moved on with a new husband and her other children while Freddie has collapsed in on himself with a glut of drinks and strippers.  However now that the killer John Booth has been released Freddie has focus and aims to kill him in revenge.  However nothing is that simple.Sean Penn Jack Nicholson and David Morse are pretty much going to be worth a look as they are all pretty intense actors when given the material to work with.  In this film Penn is the writer and director and unfortunately he is not as good as writing as he is the other facets of his job.  Here the film is pretty good but has one massive problem that it cannot get over  the script.  The film is based on clichs that you will have seen before. This itself is not a problem as although the characters are familiar it's what you do with them that counts  not their basic descriptions.However the film doesn't actually do much with these basic characters and what it does is confused and clichd as much as the basics are!  The message' of the film will be different for everyone so I won't go into that but suffice to say that the characters are never really explained and it is impossible to really feel for any of them.  They drift aimlessly for an hour or so just feeling' in a story that borders on the dull before something happens that has any meaning  and even then you could see it coming.  The script wants to be deep and meaningful and it appears to have fooled several people on this site but really it is hollow and really lacking in anything close to engagement.It is even more tragic when you see the potential that the film had.  As director Penn does pretty well with good atmosphere and style.  Likewise the cast could have been great but are mostly left to aimlessly drift with a script they can't work with.  You can tell Penn is an actor by the way he seems to have been content to let the actor's explore the space' or in my terms do what they want.  Morse is a good actor but here he is lumbered with a man who has done all his suffering off camera resulting in him being a bland character with nothing left to explore in front of us.  Huston is given nothing of value to do and the inclusion of Robin Wright Penn can surely be nothing but nepotism.Overall there is a good film in here somewhere but this is not it.  The big names gather around a script that eventually lets them down by being far too dull and simplistic and confused at the same time! and never really engages.".

A lot of tomatoes should have hit the screen the same time the movie did.  The film about a father determined to kill the man who killed his daughter in a car accident is a humiliation a series of dreary often unrelated scenes stitched together to resemble a feature.There is no drama  not genuine anyway and worst of all Jack Nicholson who I never would have believed could embarrass himself demonstrates that even the best actor needs a good director.  Operating with no direction at all Nicholson gives his worst performance since Hell's Angels on Wheels. Only David Morse the babyfaced doctor from TV's excellent St. Elsewhere distinguishes himself with a controlled characterization worthy of a decent script.Although I do not question his sincerity with this project Sean Penn really should stick to acting and if he refuses to abandon his writerdirector pretensions the least he could do is hire actors whose abilities are as limited as his own.  The Crossing Guard is amateur night on a professional budget.".

The film about a father determined to kill the man who killed his daughter in a car accident is a humiliation a series of dreary often unrelated scenes stitched together to resemble a feature.There is no drama  not genuine anyway and worst of all Jack Nicholson who I never would have believed could embarrass himself demonstrates that even the best actor needs a good director.  Operating with no direction at all Nicholson gives his worst performance since Hell's Angels on Wheels. Only David Morse the babyfaced doctor from TV's excellent St. Elsewhere distinguishes himself with a controlled characterization worthy of a decent script.Although I do not question his sincerity with this project Sean Penn really should stick to acting and if he refuses to abandon his writerdirector pretensions the least he could do is hire actors whose abilities are as limited as his own.  The Crossing Guard is amateur night on a professional budget.";

However in October 1957 everything changes when the first artificial satellite Sputnik goes into orbit. With that event Homer becomes inspired to learn how to build rockets. With his friends and the local nerd Homer sets to do just that by trial and a lot of error. Unfortunately most of the town and especially Homer's father thinks that they are wasting their time. Only one teacher in the high school understands their efforts and lets them know that they could become contenders in the national science fair with college scholarships being the prize. Now the gang must learn to perfect their craft and overcome the many problems facing them as they shoot for the stars.";

	schema:headline " A film that hits close to home....";
	schema:reviewBody "October Sky is a film that will steal your heart fill your mind with vivid imagery and lift your spirit. The tale of Homer Hickham and his dream of creating a rocket seem so simple at first especially when the film is set in a mining town where the future is as clear cut as the lumps of coal in the mine. But Homer cannot follow in his father's footsteps. With the encouragement of Miss Rileya friendly teacher members of his father's staff and his friends Homer attempts to make his dream a reality.Yet as in any true to life story there are many stops along the way. Director Joe Johnston lowers us into the coal mines where we witness the chilling plight of miners stooped beneath a ceiling of rock. With lit helmets and bent posture they resembled alien insectoids more than humans in the darkness. The hacking coughs of the miners and the blackened faces were a constant reminder of the danger the miners faced in their work.Contrasting the mine shaft's lugubrious load are the images of Homer and his friend's rocket launches. Underneath the blue bowl of sky rockets are placed upon a pad and launched into the stratosphere...And nothing can match the scene when Homer sees Sputnik for the first time.Yet what makes the film so endearing is the relationship between the characters. Homer's father is a classic hardened man...but he has a soft side as well. We see that he does love his son despite their many arguments. The love and support of Miss Riley is evident as well. Best of all the film is uncomfortable. It doesn't tie everything up in a nice bow. It tears at you lifts you up. It keeps an air of reality which is important in a film like this.This film can be considered a complete work. At first I was disappointed that the film did not continue with Homer's life. I didn't want it to end. Then I realized...that's what a good film does to a person. If it has done its job you won't want it to end. And October Sky accomplishes just that.".

What fun it was...I didn't achieve his great metaphorical and physical heights though.

The big problem is the conflict it causes between the boy and his father which I think was overdone. I would like to have a little less tension between the two.The young man still a boy is played by Jake Gyllenhaal one of his first staring assignments I think. He's likable as are his school buddies in here. It's nice to see nice kids in a modernday film. The two other key actors in the movie are Chris Cooper the dad and Laura Dern the kid's teacher who encourages him all the time.The cinematography is decent the 1950s soundtrack is fun to hear.

My own tornado landed me in my own State's Science Fair in Physics by '62 though our group was less successful in gaining the support of for example firefighters we approached for guidance and counsel until after a tragic event our city went so far as to allow us to tour the Nike missile site on Chicago's lakeshore.This movie brought it all back for me and I will bet that it brought it all back for a bunch of us UberNerds of the late '50s and early 60's.We are in a similar science brain drainage period now and really need this movie as a country.

I am watching my Life!Though younger but only by 5 years or so than the Rocket Boys I remember the absolute urgency with which Sputnick was greeted by our administrators of education and how the whole Science Fair thing gained momentum and took me and others into the competitive whirlwind. My own tornado landed me in my own State's Science Fair in Physics by '62 though our group was less successful in gaining the support of for example firefighters we approached for guidance and counsel until after a tragic event our city went so far as to allow us to tour the Nike missile site on Chicago's lakeshore.This movie brought it all back for me and I will bet that it brought it all back for a bunch of us UberNerds of the late '50s and early 60's.We are in a similar science brain drainage period now and really need this movie as a country.

A wonderful and inspiring story and a superb film of that story.Everyone was good in the film but Chris Cooper as the miner boss and stubborn father was far and away the best in October Sky.  Although rockets is the theme the film is primarily of the struggle of children trying to break out of the cycle and become more than just another coal miner. As an epilog we learn that all four of the rocket boys went to college the father died of miningrelated disease the teacher of Hodgkins disease and the whole town and mining operation was sold and shut down in the next decade.".

All plot contrivances and emotions have been explored before in other films  and possibly even better.  But despite it's familiarity and resistance to all formulas Hollywood this movie is winning and likeable at every turn. Sputnik is the inspiration for this journey of the heart mind and soul. Just as the characters from Steven Sondheim's musical MERRILY WE ROLL ALONG stood agape atop their apartment roof hoping it would launch their new generation What do you call it?  You call it a miracle. Sputnik has a similar affect on the young rocket boys of this true tale.  While jaded townsfolk of their 1950's coal town dismiss the event Homer Hickham sees Sputnik as his ticket out of a life in the mines.Masterful direction and casting make the journey of rocket boy Homer and his pals seem fresh and new.  Especially affecting are subplots concerning Homer's ailing young school teacher.  Remarkable restraint is shown in depicting their delicate relationship.  Also remarkable is the father  son supblot that anchors the film.  Perfectly played all around.  Even Homer's mom gets her moment without cliche or intrusion.  Her ultimatum to her husband is both dignified and heatbreaking.  Myrtle Beach says it all. A major video chain I despise has a sign next to this film stating that you'll love this film or they'll refund your money.  For once I agree with them.  You'll never look at the October sky quite the same again.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is an old saying that relates to the rousing new film by Joe Johnston that goes something like this The man who thinks he can and the man who thinks he can't are both right.  That is a highly presumptuous statement referring to self motivating and belief in an individual which in this movie stand true even after road blocks and family trouble stand in the way.October Sky is about a young man who believes in himself named Homer Hickam growing up in a strict traditional family in the 1950's. Homer loves in a small coal mining town where nearly every man grows up to be a miner. All of his friends Quentin Roy and O'Dell all think that their life after high school will be like everyone else's. Homer is not exited about that future.One night while everyone stares at the sky a Russian space craft called Sputnik passes overhead. This is something new for Homer and he finds it spectacular and overwhelming. From this point on his look at life will never be the same.First he tells everyone that he wants to work in the rocket scientist area for an occupation.  Flabbergasted at what he says his family passes that idea over their heads and continues with life as usual His friends however think that this idea may have some potential. After all Quentin is a very smart individual when it comes to this kind of thing.When the four friends start to test model rockets and blow a white picket fence to smithereens then what seems to be a forest fire is scared by them they're forced to end their progresses.The performances in this movie are absolutely riveting from start to finish. All of the actors give performances as if this is the real mumbo jumbo here. Standing out in all of the glory Laura Dern as Miss Riley. This very well may be Academy award material if the judges can remember back to the beginning of the year when this film is released.The characters are also extremely well developed. Not only to the filmmakers give clear apparent reason why Homer is interested in the subject but they also explain to the audience how they are succeeding in their studding of rocketry. We clearly understand all of the characters' motives and beliefs especially the father who is bent over on everlasting tradition.The film unfortunately loses some of its momentum at midpoint because of a silly recycled romantic subplot involving Homer's love interest and how his brother stole her from him. This type of this is becoming so awfully common in highschool movies not that this film is aimed at highschoolers. The actors stare at each other mindlessly like the are in a trance.  I put up with it without complaining in 1997's Inventing the Abbots but I have had just about enough this.But that is just a minor complaint. With an authentic looking time period cinematography worth an Oscar and clips of the real life Homer and friends at the end whom all hit it big with their dreams especially Homer this is the first great film of 1999.".

	schema:reviewBody "A simple and effective film about what life is all about responding to challenges. It took a lot of gall for Homer and his friends to be able to grow into manhood without falling in the trap of a prefabricated future that runs from father to son to be a miner in the local mine and never get out of that fate. It took also three different challenges for Homer and his friends to conquer a personal and free future. The challenge of the first ever manmade artificial satellite Sputnik 1 a Soviet satellite a milestone in human history a turning point that Homer and his friends could not miss did not want to miss. Then the challenge of science and applied mechanics to calculate and to devise a rocket from scratch or rather from what they could gather in books and order in their minds. Finally the challenge of a world that resists and refuses and tries to force you back into the pack even with an untimely accident that forces you to get back into the pack for plain survival necessity and even then Homer proved he had the guts to accept the challenge that was blocking for a while his own plans and dreams. But there is another side of the story that the film does not emphasize enough. Homer is the carrier of the project but he is also the carrier of the inspiration he and his friends need. If he is the one who is going to get the university scholarship because his friends gave him precedence his friends will also be able to get on their own roads and tracks and step out of the mining fate thanks to the energy his inspiring example sets in front of their eyes. It is hard at times not to follow the example of the one who is like a beacon on a difficult road. But the film is also effective to show how the father resisted this dream because for him science was not the fabric of a true man like mining or football. The working class fate that was so present in those 1950s and 1960s and still is present in some areas is too often enforced by the traditional thinking of the father. If the mother does not have the courage to speak up one day the working class fate I am speaking of becomes a tremendous trap. Here too the film is effective and it should make some parents think. This might have been the fourth challenge Homer had to face the challenge of taking a road that was not the one pointed at and programmed by his own father.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU University Paris Dauphine  University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne".

	schema:reviewBody "When I first saw the premise I thought the movie would be similar to VARSITY BLUES without the sports of course...somewhat cheesy and predictable. However as the story develops one will notice that Joe Johnston actually had a wellthought out plan for this feature. The story is moving and compelling and will affect you emotionally in ways movies like these rarely do.The reason? It's a simple movie with a relatively familiar backdrop but it's done very straightforwardly with no hint of pretension. At times there is some degree of predictability but then the story takes rather unexpected turns. Just when you think you know exactly what will happen the movie will prove your alleged clairvoyance wrong.The standout in this movie for me is the interaction between Jake Gyllenhaal and Chris Cooper. This interaction provides one of the more complex and layered fatherson relationships you will see in a movie of this nature. Laura Dern also has a small role but manages it quite effectively.Moreover much has been done to recreate the 1950s ambiance from the costumes to the art decoration to the architecture this movie looks and feels like it is based in the 1950s adding to the overall viewing experience.I would recommend this for anyone looking to see a much betterthanaverage film about belief in oneself and achieving one's dreams in the face of adversity although this movie is much more than just that. Not for those who think cheesy special effects and mindnumbingly lewd comedy are prerequisites for a good film.3.5 stars out of 4. 810. Should warrant a place in my Honourable Mentions list.".

Laura Dern also has a small role but manages it quite effectively.Moreover much has been done to recreate the 1950s ambiance from the costumes to the art decoration to the architecture this movie looks and feels like it is based in the 1950s adding to the overall viewing experience.I would recommend this for anyone looking to see a much betterthanaverage film about belief in oneself and achieving one's dreams in the face of adversity although this movie is much more than just that. Not for those who think cheesy special effects and mindnumbingly lewd comedy are prerequisites for a good film.3.5 stars out of 4. 810. Should warrant a place in my Honourable Mentions list.";

It was never a movie which was grossly advertised or hugely popular. Very honest and real account non of this typical Hollywood falseness you get in so many movies.. It's certainly got the xfactor in my books. I was surprised this movie didn't do a 'shawshank redemption' thus becoming hugely popular years after the movie was released. I first watched this movie years after it came out at the cinema on the back of a coach on a 6hour journey to the everglades in Florida i was with my family and we balled our eyes out. Not many people really knew about this movie and its precisely because of this it wins my heart.".

This is the true story of four boys in a coal mining town that instead of growing up to become coal miners like their fathers they want to do something more. They want to make something of themselves. Inspired by the launch of the first Sputnik the four boys set out to create their own rocket and win the county science fair to win themselves scholarships. OCTOBER SKY wins on every level. Humor drama a little action some romance not very much. I really enjoy movies of this caliber. While it wasn't a very big hit in theaters it was still one of the best movies that I have ever seen so far in my life. I saw this movie in science class because we are learning about the creation of rockets ourselves but I didn't really pay much attention to the building of the rocket it was more the feel and sadness of the film. It is truely a great movie to watch with or without your family. It is good either way. After I am done writing this I am going to watch it again. I just thought it best to write my review before I see it in friggen widescreen format on my DVD. I seriously cannot see how people can enjoy watching movies on widescreen. It takes away half of the screen! What the hell is up with that? And people say its better? Some people are just really stupid. But here's hoping that the great feel of the movie will keep me happy and keep me from not moaning about it. If you like this movie I also recommend THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION THE GREEN MILE STAND BY ME THE MAJESTIC THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCEand HEARTS IN ATLANTIS. 55 for all of those including OCTOBER SKY.".

He and his friends begin to build rockets. His father is not to happy about his sons new found hobby and would rather see him become a coalminer as himself or go to college on a footballscholarship like his brother.The story is well written. A bit too predictable maybe but that's OK cause it doesn't focus too much on those parts of the story. It's important part but where this is obvious the inner action the action between the characters is focused on. The story is good. It has some clichs but that's OK. It's based on actual event's so you kind of can't just drop out these clichs. The characters are really good. Where the story is on a downhill the characters are brought out and manage to keep the action and the quality of the movie high. You get to know these characters and you get sympathy for them. They are well written and believable.This is a good looking movie. The sets and the 50's style is thorough and the pictures are well composed and well lit. This all sets the mood of the film very good.The acting is really good. Jake Gyllenhaal delivers a great performance as Homer Hickam and Chris Cooper is good as John Hickam. As for the rest of the cast they are good too. All together this makes out a pretty strong cast.All in all I'm glad I caught this movie. It was first after seeing it I learned that it was based on actual events. If I had known that when seeing it it would probably just be even more interesting. October Sky is a good and interesting movie. It's a movie I believe everyone can enjoy. It's kind of a feelgood movie. Not bad at all!".

Despite a preachy and simplistic screenplay the intense direction and firstrate performances make this film work. I particularly loved Denzel's work here because this was a character unlike he had ever played before...Denzel usually played welleducated intelligent lawyers andor businessmen with the obvious exception of TRAINING DAY but here Denzel is playing an average Joe...a working stiff struggling to pay bills and keep food on the table and a roof over his family's head who is driven to extreme measures to protect the family he cherishes so dearly. Washington gets strong support from Robert Duvall solid as always as the hostage negotiator James Woods as a wimpy surgeon Anne Heche as an unsympathetic hospital administrator and especially Kimberly Elise as John's wife. An emotional drama wrought with tension that will rivet you to the screen.".

I praised him when he said I don't want to bury my son I want my son to bury me! In a way he's willing to sacrifice himself to save his son.

Sure you see a sort of homage to Dog Day Afternoon in John Q but thats it the movie has its own plot.  I enjoyed this film Denzel Washington is really believeable as the downonhisluck father and the rest of the supporting cast executed their characters very well.  Most notably the great Robert Duvall as the hostage negotiator and Ray Liotta as the stuckup police chief.  I won't say more about this movie other than it is heartbreaking and you can almost feel the pain frustration John Q has to go through.  4 stars out of 5.".

	schema:reviewBody "Highly underrated and ignored by most in 2002 John Q is one of those movies that is sometimes too intelligent for a viewing public unfamiliar with topics never really thought about in common societal circles health care and insurance policies rights of bluecollar citizens media exploitation law enforcement practices and overpaid medical specialists. Denzel Washington's young son falls out one day at a little league baseball game. The diagnosis is frightening. Without a new heart the boy will most definitely die. Washington a normal everyday citizen lacks substantial resources and benefits from his insurance to even get his son on a donor's list. It is blatantly obvious that Washington and wife Kimberly Elise are being strangled by red tape in a mercilessly heartless no pun intended system. Friends Laura Herring and David Thornton and seemingly countless other ordinary people do their best to help the couple raise money and soon it seems that most everything they have is on the market to be sold. Work and more hard work does not get the couple much closer to having the money they desperately need. Washington realizes that time is now of the essence. He has been pushed and pushed again and now he takes it upon himself to push back. As a last resort he literally takes the doctor James Woods hostage along with other bystanders who have nothing to do with Washington's war with the hospitals and insurance organizations. Immediately cops led by Robert Duvall and Ray Liotta surround the hospital and the tenseness builds. Hungry media cronies who would not help Washington when he had asked earlier also try to benefit from the misery of all those that are involved with their typical exploitation tactics one thing Jerry Springer got right. Will Washington's son be saved and is Washington actually willing to take his own life in the venture so his boy can live? John Q is a very impressive production from director Nick Cassavetes showing much of the same ability his late father John showed throughout his career. Screenwriter James Kearns gets to the soul of an American society that has been blinded by economics and inefficient bigwigs who have no business possessing the careers they have. Morality has gone out the window and that hypocritical oath that is so prevalent in the medical field seems to be little more than a silly afterthought. John Q succeeds everywhere just about except in its ending. The ending is a major mistake that took away from some of the good things accomplished before the final ten minutes. Washington arguably better here than in recent triumphs like Training Day an Oscarwinning role and Antwone Fisher goes to an even higher plateau here. Much like Al Pacino in the equally underrated Dog Day Afternoon an admittedly better picture Washington dominates in a role that thrives on a claustrophobic aspect that cannot be escaped or denied within the film's running time. Duvall and Woods are also solid as always but Washington is the man here. Strikingly accurate when pointing the finger at things wrong with America these days John Q is a thoughtprovoking production that will cause its audience to think and learn about sometimes forgotten aspects of human life. 4 stars out of 5.".

My cousin lives in the United States i don't and she told me a few complaints about this problem in the movie i finally understood about that. I don't understand how the most powerful country in the world does have such bad health services to it's people?. For the benefit of the Americans i hope that they change this system soon. Denzel puts his hearth on this movie playing a normal guy with financial problems and a hard work the way that Denzel shows his love to his son is remarkable and demonstrates why he is one of the actual best actors in Hollywood. If you have seen Searching for David's Hearth 2004 this is as the other side of the story.About the Movie Denzel Washington plays John Quincy Archibald John Q. a husband and father with some financial problems that works almost 20 hours a day on a factory but who can't afford his expenses. John is trying to get a second job in order to earn an extra money. In the middle of this John's son Mike Daniel E. Smith is found to have a disease caused by a bigger than normal heart and the doctors told him that he will die soon if they don't make a heart transplant. Here everything is hard but it gets really harder when John goes to the insurance company and get the notice that his insurance suddenly don't cover this type of procedures. John and his wife Denise Kimberly Elise start to make everything possible to collect the money a lot of money needed just to get his son on the donor's list with their son dying an not much money John desperate and takes the hospital's emergency room staff and patients hostage demanding for to his son to be put on that list and that doctors do the transplant. The story evolves emotionally deep trough all this in a remarkable script.About the Cast Denzel Washington put his soul onto this role being by far the best of all!! Kimberly Elise does good too but a little exaggerated sometimes Daniel Smith as Mike is pretty poor in his acting he didn't had to do that much but this kid sorry still isn't a good actor he has years to perfect his performance. James Woods acting as Dr. Raymond Turner as always is very good and professional also Anne Hache as Rebbeca Payne is great and show a coldness that ripped me out. Robert Duvall acting is good but his character could have been deployed even more for the good of the film. Ray Liotta does good Eddie Griffin is good too as one of the characters of the emergency room Wow this was a great cast! 810! Excellent for Denzel Washington performance!".

Though a decent film it's flaws come up evidently but Denzel manages to hold you till the end.Denzel stars as John Quincy Archibald a father and husband whose son is diagnosed with an enlarged heart and then finds out he cannot receive a transplant because HMO insurance will not cover it. Therefore he decides to take a hospital full of patients hostage until the hospital puts his son's name on the recipient's list.The Idea is interesting  challenging. The film begins with a class as the writing holds you. But in the second hour especially the writing gets lose and even the culmination isn't as good as one expects it to be. Nick Cassavetes directs this emotional story with patience. Cinematography  Editing are fine. ActingWise As mentioned right from the beginning Denzel rules the show. A performance so welldone that it holds you even when the writing falters. In the supporting cast Bobby Duvall James Woods  Kimberly Elise are efficient. Anne Heche  Ray Liotta are passable. Others lend support. On the whole 'John Q' is interesting in parts but what really stands tall in this film is it's leadstar's performance.".

With his son weakening John takes the staff and patients of a hospital hostage as he demands doctors perform the surgery.Denzel Washington plays John and as usual gives a very effecting performance that shows the strength and determination of a father's love without descending into schmaltz. Kimberly Elise in her role as John's wife Denise nicely compliments his portrayal as a wife who wants a quiet life but will support her husband in anything if that is what it takes to save their son. The film also has strong support from Robert Duvall as the hostage negotiator who sympathises with John but has a job to do and James Woods in an uncharacteristically role as a spineless doctor who is more interested in his own life than the patients.The actual storyline was a bit too overlysentimental at times but only someone with a hard heart couldn't be moved by John's plight. 'John Q' does highlight a number of ethical questions such as how far should a parent go to save their child and ultimately how could such a tragedy happen in the twentyfirst century America that a child is denied a heart transplant purely because their family can't afford it? Living in the UK we have the National Health Service which is far from perfect but at least parents wouldn't have to take the law into their own hands to ensure their child is given the surgery they need to live. Despite the rather happy resolution to the film there is still a sadness to the story because this sort of thing probably does happen despite America being so rich.'John Q' is a wellmade thriller for those who also enjoy dramas and familybased films but it's also one which should be forced down the throats of every politician across the globe about why adequate health care should be provided for all not matter what their financial status is.".

If you are a Denzel fan and feel like watching a well performed and touching film... then get a box of tissues and sit down and watch 'John Q'. It isn't his best film but certainly another one of his well performed ones. This story is about a poor family and the poor health system in America. He loves his son dearly and will do anything for him. This is the tale about a man who will stop at nothing to try and save his son's life who needs a new heart and it truly is touching.".

While the rich can afford private rooms and private care we all deserve the right to the best standard care that can save our basic lives.  There are many in America who say that health care is NOT a right.  Of course it is because doctors take the hippocratic oath to help EVERYONE and then it gets distorted into a business.  While not condoned the actions of Denzel Washington do save his son's life in 'John Q' and while America continues to be the only G7 nation not to have socialized medicine for all its people here in Canada we are slowly seeing the decay of our health care situation into a two tier system where the rich will get better care than everyone else.  As the film tries to make this political point there are big holes in the script in some of the situations but the conclusion is right on target as it does not excuse John Q's actions entirely.  He has the majority of the public support on his side and that is the secret message that if people help each other namely doctors insurance companies HMOs and rich hospitals what a better world this would be.".

The best way they did this was by casting an adorable child as the innocent victim of a healthcare system gone wrong. Add to that the very loving parents played quite effectively by Denzel Washington and Kimberly Elise who are also hard workers and there is very little to fault them for the situation they find themselves in. Granted this isn't the case for everyone in the US who find themselves without coverage as there are many who are just too lazy to work and expect the government to provide all their needs without their making any effort.But with politics aside this is a very powerful movie that is heavy on the pulling of the heart strings. They do a great job of building and escalating tension throughout the movie  though some may find it manipulative. There is quite a stirring sacrifice offered near the end that I won't reveal but it really took me by surprise.I think one of my favorite scenes is the opening sequence with the impatient lady driving the BMW erratically through the mountains. It was beautifully filmed in slow motion with a rousing classical score to accompany.

For the most part it is horribly conventional and certainly doesn't come without flaws but I find it intriguing topically.

It made you care a lot about the characters without boring you during their introduction. It presents a crime to you a hostage situation that to most people will seem justified something rather unusual in movies. V for Vendetta comes to mind which makes terrorism seem justified. Whether the crime is actually justified or not is the question 'John Q' asks the audience. And that's where I think the film succeeds.

Just scanning through some of the user comments here it's apparent that this is a most divisive picture amongst the American users no great deal of middle ground it's either preachy nonsense trying to make a moral stance or it's a highly involving picture tenderly bringing to light a serious issue.My thoughts are quite simply that as a drama it works considerably well the issue at hand makes for a compelling picture and even allowing for an overkilling of sentimental strands it's intelligent and never less than interesting. However the constant stream of formulaic characters hinders the film and stops it totally achieving its aims to anyone who hasn't seen this picture i would wager that if i asked you to pick ten characters for a hostage piece you would get nine of them right. It's a real shame because John Q is a fine film in substance and is backed up by a competent cast list even if not all of them are quite utilised to the maximum.Taking the lead as John Q is Denzel Washington few actors of his generation can give so much emotion into a character it's a great turn from him and one that deserves far more credit that it gets. Robert Duvall and James Woods have critical roles but not given enough meat to really get their respective teeth into Ray Liotta is safe and enjoyable in an annoying role whilst Kimberly Elise as mother Denise and Anne Heche the cold hearted hospital administrator are merely making up the numbers. A bit more bravery and a bit less sentiment may well have lifted John Q into one of this decades best dramas category as it is it's a missed opportunity that still delivers enough punch for this particular viewer to give it the thumbs up. 710".

The latter comes from Demi Moore who plays Erin Grant the FBI secretary  losing her job and the custody over her daughter to no good small time crook wheelchairs stealing husband Robert Patrick looking and acting like a stoned redneck version of Gary Oldman and who takes a job as an exotic dancer in the local club Eager Beaver to earn money for her court appeal. In the club she becomes the hottest attraction and meets many...interesting characters the most colorful being of course Congressman David Dilbeck Burt Reynolds who just loves naked women. It's a character flaw and who is absolutely smitten by Erin.

One scene where Shad tells to Dilbeck's bodyguards that Meryl Streep used to work in Eager Beaver as an exotic dancer and they seem to believe him is brilliant. If only everything had been as good as he was we would've had a really great movie. What do we have now? Well Demi Moore looks really good with the minimum clothes on. I mean the woman was a 33 year old mother of three at the time and her body was marvel to behold. I just think that she was too serious intense and solemn doing the striptease numbers  after all it is not only strip it is tease too. It goes to her acting in the movie in general. Reynolds seemed to have a lot of fun with his sleazy drunk Congressman David Dilbeck electionday choice of Christian groups and a lot of laughs comes from his mannerism and quotes. There are plenty of laughs actually in Striptease but quite often they seem like the wrong and unintentional type for the movie material. Who had the best laugh? I'd guess Demi Moore did after been paid 12.5 million  one of the highest paychecks for an actress back then.".

Demi Moore plays a mother who works in a striptease bar to raise money for a trial to get her daughter back from her criminal exhusband. When a corrupt congressman becomes obsessed with her misbehaves and is blackmailed his political friends set out to kill everyone who endangers the reelection of their puppet. Demi Moore's character as those of her allies the formidable bouncer Shad and the clever and honest Police Lt. Al Garcia are very likable and easy to identify with. Armand Assante as Al Garcia and Ving Rhames as Shad put in excellent performances as did most of the supporting cast such as Stuart Pankin as dodgy lawyer Robert Patrick as crazy exhusband or Paul Guilfoyle as sinister campaign manager. What I did not like and which was consequently attacked in almost all reviews of this movie are the actual striptease scenes. They are not sexy are nothing but distractions and should have been kept down to a minimum. Also Demi Moore's acting performance while not bad is not on on a par with for instance Burt Reynold's.Speaking of Burt Reynolds he is what makes this movie special. I challenge anyone to name a politician in movie history who is more corrupt or depraved than Reynold's character in this movie. Can there ever be a scene that more vividly portrays corrupt politics than when the congressman has to be dragged away by his handlers from his masturbation session to hold a speech to young Christians about family values? But may be it is this political message that caused the media to revile this movie so which it does not deserve.".

The stripping is awful it is apparently heavily erotic  I didn't see anything erotic the dancing is laughable this has to be the most overrated erotic movie of all time. There is nothing not a single relevant serious well choreographed erotic dance clip or sex scene. The story was turned into a very shallow script and the only thing that the directors cared about was showing Demi Moore in a thong. Looking back this is where Demi's career ended. This movie was so bad it evicted Demi from the movie industry that disabled her any opportunity for a serious role. Demi Moore will be remembered forever in Striptease the woman who showed a few bits of her butt in embarrassing fashion. There's no substance no intrigue no real insight no drama if they wanted to do a sexually orientated movie then they should have waived the rights to Hustler to make a porno movie. Who ever played in this movie never recovered from it in the aftermath. Even for 15M it's not worth it. Oh and the viewer also wastes 2hrs of his time.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was cruising through my movie channels and I saw that Striptease was playing I remember seeing the trailer for this movie back in 1994 when I was a kid and wanted to see it oh my parents had to forbid it. But of course since I'm 23 and on my own I think I was allowed to view it. I kinda wish now that I had my parents here to tell me no because this movie was really bad. I mean most people make fun of Showgirls I mean yeah it's understandable but at least that had personality and more memorable moments than this. Demi Moore just strips down to some really depressing music and this movie has the strangest humor in the world. I could see how some people might get a kick out of it but over all it just a bad movie it has no zest and nothing to make it special. A story about a stripper... OK here it goes.The film revolves around Erin Grant a former FBI secretary who loses custody of her young daughter Angela to her exhusband Darrell. In order to afford an appeal Erin becomes a stripper at the Eager Beaver a Miami strip club. A Congressman named David Dilbeck visits the club and immediately begins to adore Grant. Aware of Dilbeck's embarrassing indulgences another Eager Beaver patron approaches Erin with a plan to manipulate the Congressman to settle the custody dispute in Erin's favor. However Dilbeck has powerful business connections who want to ensure he remains in office. Consequently those who can embarrass him in an election are murdered. Meanwhile Erin retrieves her daughter from her negligent husband. Dilbeck's personal interest in Erin persists and she is invited to perform privately for him. He asks her to become his lover and later his wife despite his staff's concerns that she knows too much information. A debate occurs as to whether to kill Erin or simply keep her quiet by threatening to take away her daughter.Demi is alright in the movie if even that I'm being pretty generous considering she let her daughter Rumor act as her daughter in this movie. If I were Rumor I'd be like next time I pick the motherdaughter bonding event. I wouldn't really feel like watching my mother dance around naked for men nore a camera. Well Rumor must have gotten a huge raise in her allowance for that to happen. But anyways I wouldn't recommend Striptease it was a sleazy movie I would even go as far to say that if you want sleaze go for Showgirls it's more fun to watch and make fun of this was just a sad movie.110".

	schema:reviewBody "If you're anything like me you probably came across this movie with no one in mind other than Demi Moore but ended up also being entertained by the likes of Burt Reynolds Robert Patrick and Ving Rhames. I read many reviews that just thrash this movie because it's nothing like the book it is based upon and I wonder is that ALWAYS necessary? Should that be the case for every single movie adapted from a book? I think that on many occasions writers and filmmakers are allowed to give their own spins and turns to the material they are working with. Having said that I think that many reviewers couldn't get passed that and never saw this film for its own merit. It is a decent effort and nowhere near as bad as some are trying to make it out to be. Striptease is an interesting blend of dark humour and a fairly dramatic tone that while it doesn't try to be one or the other it merely seeks to find the right balance between them. Demi Moore plays a single mother who is an exotic dancer and at the beginning of the film she loses custody of her daughter to her sleazy husband who seems to make things really difficult for her. She works at the Eager Beaver stripclub and her main interest during the entire movie is to get her daughter back. Burt Reynolds plays the congressman David Dilbeck who becomes infatuated with Moore's character Erin Grant and he does so seeming quite clownish and somewhat cartoonish at times but never stops being lighthearted in every scene he's in. Ving Rhames plays the club Eager Beaver's bouncer Shad and does a phenomenal job juxtaposing his expression of overseriousness in his face with clever sarcastic remarks. Demi Moore delivers in the sense that you feel her character is divided between earning money by dancing and feeling guilty for having been seen dancing by her daughter which she conveys the discomfort in one particular scene. And if you came to watch a movie called Striptease starring Demi Moore and hoped to catch a glimpse of her stripping and her otherwordly halfnaked body you will most definitely not be disappointed! She's got a sculptural body that will leave you standing watching in awe whether you're a man or a woman. And on top of all that you got a fun movie! What more could you possibly want? Oh right it also has a great soundtrack.".

Demi Moore gave her 100 in the stripper character and wasn't afraid of breaking new grounds and offending people in 1996. This is a recipe for success just like Madonna did for the entire lifetime of her career. I love especially the scene where she stripteases from a cabaret costume with the fedora hat. Hot! And all this plot about the gangster guys and how she needs to protect her and her daughter makes it a timeless revolutionary movie in my opinion. a. For the relatively low budget at the time in 1996 this movie is a modern masterpiece in my opinion and since almost 20 years no one has even dared to replicate such subject matter and plot on the big screen.".

	schema:headline " A Triumph For Ullmann And Bergman";
	schema:reviewBody "Ensconced in the study of his house on a secluded island off the coast of Sweden an aging director reminisces and reflects on aspects of his life apparently still in need of resolution in Faithless' written by Ingmar Bergman and directed by Liv Ullmann.  Bergman is the name of the director played by Erland Josephson who engages in a fantasy conversation with a woman named Marianne Lena Endre who confesses to him her affair after eleven years of marriage with a man named David Krister Henriksson the best friend of her husband Markus Thomas Hanzon.  Through their conversations as well as scenes depicting particular episodes from her life beginning with the initial encounter with David we learn the intimate details of Marianne's life as well as Markus' and their young daughter's Isabelle Michelle Gylemo and of course David's.  It's an intense engrossing character study that examines the weaknesses and foibles of human nature to which we are all susceptible.  It's a story that is by turns grim and thoughtful at times poignant while at other moments distressing as it reflects the myriad emotional levels to which the human condition is prone at any given time.  As the story progresses it becomes impossible to distance yourself from the characters involved in the drama for there is so much about them with which anyone in the audience will be readily able to identify not necessarily with the infidelities but grounded in the choices we all must make throughout our lives and the consequences thereof and upon which a film like this precipitates rumination.  As with all of the films Bergman has written andor directed during his career it is a pensive thoughtprovoking incursion into reality. As she proved with her directorial debut of the 1997 film Private Confessions' also scripted by Bergman Liv Ullmann is more than up to the formidable task of bringing Bergman's story to the screen.  Her style of directing is similar to Bergman's as could be expected their close working and personal relationship has spanned more than thirty years but her approach is perhaps a bit softer than his and uniquely her own.  In the final analysis any similarities are primarily due to the story which lends itself to the style Bergman perfected and upon which Ullmann certainly draws.  It's not so much a matter of imitation as it is of following an intrinsic pattern conducive to the storytelling and Ullmann has an innate sensitivity to the material that translates into the presentation of the drama and elicits the necessary sympathy and compassion from the audience that enhances the impact of it.  Like Bergman she uses the camera to help capture the sense of the drama visually which at times creates an almost ethereal poetic atmosphere that contrasts so well with the more stoic aspects of the story.  Ullmann has an excellent sense of rhythm and the pace of the film allows the viewer time to assimilate the many nuances of emotion expressed through the characters. Lena Endre gives a remarkable performance as Marianne infusing a passion into the character that makes it ring so true to life and it's one of the strengths of the film.  She bares Marianne's soul leaving no question as to the inner turmoil with which she must cope and it reflects in Bergman's character as well through her struggles we also feel the remorse of Bergman's character and upon reflection it makes you realize how effective Josephson is in the role of Bergman.  For it is in his subtle reactions to the phantom Marianne and in his silent ruminations that we learn so much about all that has transpired in their lives.  Henriksson gives a notable performance as well deftly exposing the complexities of the character that lie beneath the somewhat reserved exterior of the man while Hanzon is effective as Markus as is Gylemo as the young Isabelle.  With Faithless' Ullmann firmly establishes her mark as an artist of extraordinary vision and sense of reality.  Her collaboration with Ingmar Bergman is a cinematic triumph and we can only hope that there will be more to follow for with every film they make another chapter is written in the Book of Life.  I rate this one 1010.".

Her style of directing is similar to Bergman's as could be expected their close working and personal relationship has spanned more than thirty years but her approach is perhaps a bit softer than his and uniquely her own.  In the final analysis any similarities are primarily due to the story which lends itself to the style Bergman perfected and upon which Ullmann certainly draws.  It's not so much a matter of imitation as it is of following an intrinsic pattern conducive to the storytelling and Ullmann has an innate sensitivity to the material that translates into the presentation of the drama and elicits the necessary sympathy and compassion from the audience that enhances the impact of it.  Like Bergman she uses the camera to help capture the sense of the drama visually which at times creates an almost ethereal poetic atmosphere that contrasts so well with the more stoic aspects of the story.  Ullmann has an excellent sense of rhythm and the pace of the film allows the viewer time to assimilate the many nuances of emotion expressed through the characters. Lena Endre gives a remarkable performance as Marianne infusing a passion into the character that makes it ring so true to life and it's one of the strengths of the film.  She bares Marianne's soul leaving no question as to the inner turmoil with which she must cope and it reflects in Bergman's character as well through her struggles we also feel the remorse of Bergman's character and upon reflection it makes you realize how effective Josephson is in the role of Bergman.  For it is in his subtle reactions to the phantom Marianne and in his silent ruminations that we learn so much about all that has transpired in their lives.  Henriksson gives a notable performance as well deftly exposing the complexities of the character that lie beneath the somewhat reserved exterior of the man while Hanzon is effective as Markus as is Gylemo as the young Isabelle.  With Faithless' Ullmann firmly establishes her mark as an artist of extraordinary vision and sense of reality.  Her collaboration with Ingmar Bergman is a cinematic triumph and we can only hope that there will be more to follow for with every film they make another chapter is written in the Book of Life.  I rate this one 1010.";

	schema:headline " A magnificent cathartic film";
	schema:reviewBody "Last night I watched Faithless and  I've thought about it almost constantly since.  A magnificent heartrending film.  Surely this is Bergman's finest script.  It's absolutely uncompromising in its unsentimental clinical storytelling and filled with that compassion devoid of hope that is Bergman's trademark and his own world view.Hopelessness as the key to dignified human life day by day would seem to be an apt description of Bergman's philosophy.I won't give away the dnouement of the story in case you are fortunate enough not to have seen it yet and to be able to see it.  Let me just say that I was completely surprised by the plot twist near the endit caught me entirely offguard and later I felt that I should have seen it coming but I didn't.  That's the mark of a master writer to be able to take the reader or viewer unaware.  Ingmar Bergman could have had a career as a mysterysuspense writer if he'd wanted to.  I'm glad he didn't.The story of Faithless is that of a marriage plunged into chaos by the aftermath of one chance phrase uttered by a close friend of the married couple to the wife after a latenight supper.  With a dazzling propensity for making wrong choices which if we're honest we'll all recognize existing in our own lives the protagonists rush headlong into a hell of their own making.  At the center of the story like a small still silent observer resides Isabelle the nineyearold daughter.  The effect of the grownups' actions on this poor child renders the story all the more poignant and horrifying.But what I've sketched here omitting the surprise towards the last is only half the story.  And in a sense it's not even the real story. For Marianne and Markus the married couple David the mutual friend Isabelle and the other main characters don't in a sense even exist. The film opens in the study of an elderly film director played by Erland Josephson close friend and colleague of Bergman and the actor who played Joseph the husband in Scenes from a Marriagewhere his character's wife's name Marianne matches that of the character played in this film by Lena Endre in an unforgettable tourdeforce amounting to a twoandahalfhour monologue Marianne in the earlier film reminiscent of this one in many ways was played with similar bravado by this film's director Liv Ullman longtime associate of Bergman and for some years his lover.  The setting might well be Bergman's own study in his house on the remote Swedish island where he's lived in isolation for the past several years. The desk is slightly more cluttered than Bergman's own which is adorned only with a clock and a photograph of his wife with whom he admits he still has conversations years after her death which devastated him and helped drive him into exile.  The room is almost bare otherwise immaculately kept furnished with a stereo an armchair a couple of lamps a few photographs on the wall.  The exterior scenes were undoubtedly shot on location on the actual island.The director is seated at his desk talking aloud to an empty room but addressing Marianne.  First as a shadow behind him then fully visible seated on a windowseat Marianne appears at his bidding.  The movie goes on from theresessions of talk in the director's study the director mainly asking pointed questions Marianne and later David sometimes hesitant or afraid to answer but gradually revealing the painful facts of their excruciating misconduct.  Significantly at a crucial point the director comforts each of these imaginary but in the film very real creatures by a caress to the cheekas if wiping away a child's tears.  At the end of the turbulent story he's left alone with his manuscriptand the dark rolling sea.  He walks slowly awkwardly along the pebbly beach lost in thought just as Bergman does every day.I believe that thanks to the incalculable combined talent of Bergman and Ullman this film offers the viewer catharsis as in the Greek tragedies.  I certainly have felt very different in the hours since viewing it.  If religious leaders had the courage and honesty to offer their faithful the same hopeless but compassionate view of life as this film and Bergman's own outlook afford then I think the world would be a much better place. Ironically Bergman's point of view is largely the result of a childhood spent under the heavy hand of Protestantism.  His father was a stern pastor.  But the result has been Protestantism with a twist in a godless world we doom ourselves to shame and horror yet we can somehow still find the dignity to go on living one day at a time doing the best we can with our pathetic lives.  And that's the best we can do.  There is no redemption not even in art but there may be some clarification if we're lucky.In the end all we had was ourselves and one another.  And we did what we thought we had to do.".

	schema:reviewBody "Not to be an elitist but no one I know is more familiar with the work and life of Ingmar Bergman than yours truly so when his latest and longawaited film Faithless was recently released I was immediately eager to see it. And staying true to his promise never to direct another film after Fanny and Alexander he couldn't have picked a better director for his script than his protege and longtime colleague Liv Ullman. So what we end up with in Faithless is a truetoform Bergmanesque tale that runs a bit too long and has one too many tragedies.For the most part the film is pretty much saved by excellent performances especially the portrayal of Marianne by Lena Endre. The plot is a tangled web of infidelity and its consequences punctuated with as much heartbreak pain and suffering as any Bergman opus and certainly as much as the average viewer can imagine or tolerate. To be sure Bergman isn't for everyone. But if you enjoy an occasional catharsis immobilizing intensity and walking out of the theater thinking your life isn't as bad as you thought it was this film's for you. For those of you familiar with and amenable to Bergman trademarks you won't be disappointed. There are plenty of long facial closeups monologues ghosts as figurative demons and a character that represents Bergman himself. This last feature is one of the machinations I feel we could have done without. It adds a character who is not really part of the plot and does little more than listen. There's also a heaviness to the plot that kind of hits you over the head. Major drama is all right with me and Bergman is one of the best in that genre but it was dangerously close to the saturation point of redundance and pretension. Nevertheless for all you Bergman fans foreign film lovers and wannabe celluloid asthetes you really should add this title to your repetoire. Bergman is truly one of the greatest filmmakers of all time and considering his very advanced age this could be his last outing. Then again...".

She tells him all details of her life as a married woman betraying her husband with his best friend and the consequences of her actions. All this seems so sterile from time to time yet you'll be touched by it in the most profound way especially when you see how her 9year old daughter is aware of everything that is happening around her and how it influences her life...Ingmar Bergman's script is so sober yet so surprising. You think you know where the movie is going but only at the end of the movie you'll understand the full picture. It's so cold and warm at the same time it's a little story telling a huge tale.

The story is deliberately paced and also intelligent and poignant in both the storytelling and how the themes are incorporated and Bergman writes one of his more personal and insightful scripts.

Faithless is directed by Liv Ullmann and written by Ingmar Bergman.The premise of having the story narrated works beautifully especially for a twist that happens near the end. It is also a wonderful excuse to include Josephson a past collaborator with both Bergman and Ullmann.The characters in the story seem to have more advantages than most. All of them earn a living and for some a good one at that in the arts Marianne is an actress her lover David Krister Henriksson is a theatrefilm director albeit one in serious debt and her husband Markus Thomas Hanzon is an internationally renowned orchestra conductor. While it may be tempting to envy those living the artistic life the ones depicted here should be avoided in the envy trap due to the troubles they face.Some might argue that the film is too long at two and a half hours. It might also be argued that there were too many elements of drama especially those added to the end when it seemed there was already enough to absorb. While these might be fair arguments one thing is certain Ullmann and her cast easily bring viewers to an emotional state and keep them there. Endre particularly gives an exceptional performance especially during two monologues.Whether collaborating as actress  director or director  writer Ullmann and Bergman easily create great magic together. While Faithless is a relatively recent film its depth and intensity remind one of earlier collaborations of these two great artists in the 60s and 70s as well as other great works of that magnificent era.OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENTSDirecting by Liv UllmannActing by Lena Endre".

That Bergman's DNA is all through the film is not a surprise Ullmann was Bergman's dear friend former lover and sometimes enemy and her work  and personal life  will forever be linked with Bergman and his style it's easy to believe that Ullmann learned all she knows about filmmaking from her years studying under one of the alltime greats. And she learned well for she is a very fine director.Even by Bergman film standards 'Trolsa' is bleak viewing. While so many of Bergman's films are about suffering and pain there was rarely a feeling of absolute hopelessness at their core the light shone through the darkness in moments of tenderness and beauty especially in the eyes of his exceptional heroine actorcummartyrs particularly Ullmann herself.There isn't any such redemption here which features very strong acting from its three main characters played by Lena Endr Krister Henriksson and Thomas Hanzon but no signs of warmth or hope to cling onto all three are deeply unlikeable and selfish in their suffering. So much so it's almost a relief when this long film ends and we're rid of them. It's hard not to feel for the actors because despite their talents this was a very tough script to transform into enjoyable viewing and it largely fails in this regard.The only character that isn't unlikeable is played by the little girl Isabelle Michelle Gylemo but unfortunately her character is so underwritten that she mostly plays the role of mute suffering in the background. And at the film's ending after we learn that Marianne dies from drowning we don't even get to find out what happens to the orphaned Isabelle  her character is discarded like a prop which ironically is how her parents treated her yet we hear from dull David who continues to feel sorry for himself seemingly always finding new ways to be miserable.Considering what Isabelle went through the messy dissolution of her parents' marriage and resulting instability her mother and her new lover screaming at each other constantly her father committing suicide and nearly taking her with him and finally her mother's death by drowning she probably ended up in a loony bin.The most affecting and tender performance in the film is given by its best actor the legendary Erland Josephson star of countless Bergman films playing an elderly Bergman wrestling with his demons and attempting to exorcise them the only way he knows how  by writing films about them.".

The enigmatic Swede that happily orchestrates an affair with one of her good friends a friend of the family and her husbands best friend. She thinks it will be fun without any consequences. It's like a willingness to suspend disbelief or just plain denial that anything could go wrong or that anyone could be hurt. I must admit that is the point I simply don't go for. Apart from that Liv Ullmann does a brilliant job of directing. She has a master's touch for giving the audience enough but not too much just enough to keep you absolutely fascinated. The script is obviously very good by Ingmar Bergman but Ullmann has improved it dramatically with her alterations and additions. She takes a woman who has everything and shows what happens when you take it all for granted and greedily take more. Henricksson's character is at least honest about his ability to destroy everything he touches. His character remains the same throughout and loses nothing. It is Marianne who loses the lot and sorry to say rightly so. This is a beautifully done morality tale that does not leave out the inevitable damage the children are forced to endure at the hands of their selfish stupid lustful parents.".

	schema:reviewBody "Faithless although directed by Liv Ulmann is undoubtedly a work stamped with Ingmar Bergman's approach to filmmaking. Equally however it is freighted with the pitfalls that many of his pieces fall prey to and which make him at time an extremely frustrating artist. Occasionally as with the Seventh Seal one feels he truly is penetrating his subject delivering a lyrical profound meditation on the struggle for life and conversely against death. At other times however it feels as if he is not delving deep enough. Examples of this can be found in Summer With Monika and to a lesser extent Fanny and Alexander. The visuals are there the story the ideas but no penetrative insights. Unfortunately Faithless is marred by the same problem. To watch is like witnessing a pebble skimming the surface of an ocean each time it looks and seems as if it will break the water and penetrate into the dark sea it simply glances off the surface and skips onwards.One of the main problems with Faithless is the depth and fullness of the characters. This of course is absolutely crucial to the success or failure of a film or play where there is no omniscient narrator who can illuminate the inner workings of the protagonists. One must rely solely on dialogue and action for insight into the inner workings of the characters and hence as a means of developing sympathy and an emotional attachment to the events of their lives. In Faithless the protagonists are never fully developed. Marianne the female lead inexorably drawn to adultery at the expense of marriage and parenthood David her selfdeprecating destructive lover and Markus her unstable husband are all depicted as merely reactive shallow individuals. Since they themselves have no insights into their actions even when given the opportunity to soliloquise their actions hold no interest become tedious to witness and convey no broader conceptual meanings. The viewer must merely watch them commit deeds without reason react without reflection and recall without observing.In addition the plot of the film is treated on its own unremarkable and covering ground already well trodden not least of all by Bergman himself. It struck me as strange when viewing this film that a man as advanced in years and as seasoned as a cinematic artist should produce a piece so deeply pedestrian particularly when some of his prior works have displayed obvious skill intelligence and passion. Faithless could irrespective of its bare bones plot have been elevated beyond the level of mediocrity by the conveyance of a deeper level of meaning but without this it is little more than a wellcrafted rendering of a familiar story. By no means bad and certainly better than many films it nevertheless fails to attain the level of excellence set by Bergman and other masters of the cinematic arts in the past.".

The switching back and forth between recollections and real time makes the viewer often impatient. At first I tried to sympathize with one or more of the characters but after the first half I realized that this was not possible. What kind of a sane woman betrays a loving sexually satisfying handsome orchestra conductor of a husband with an ugly aggressive egocentric and unsuccessful loser was beyond me. I looked hard but could not see the temptation. Slowly all characters started acting more and more irrationally and after a while I just started not caring about what would happen next and began counting the minutes. Toward the end bad things started to happen one after another several revelations were made but it was too late for me to start caring.".

At first I tried to sympathize with one or more of the characters but after the first half I realized that this was not possible. What kind of a sane woman betrays a loving sexually satisfying handsome orchestra conductor of a husband with an ugly aggressive egocentric and unsuccessful loser was beyond me. I looked hard but could not see the temptation. Slowly all characters started acting more and more irrationally and after a while I just started not caring about what would happen next and began counting the minutes. Toward the end bad things started to happen one after another several revelations were made but it was too late for me to start caring.";

They have accrued their wealth largely through Dr. Sloper's hard work. Despite the lessons that Dr. Sloper has paid for in all the social graces for her Catherine is a plain simple awkward and extremely shy woman who spends all her free time alone doing embroidery when she is not doting on her father. Catherine's lack of social charm and beauty  unlike her deceased mother  is obvious to Dr. Sloper who hopes that Lavinia will act as her guardian in becoming more of a social person and ultimately as chaperon if Catherine were ever to meet the right man. The first man ever to show Catherine any attention is the handsome Morris Townsend who she met at a family party. Catherine is initially uncertain as to ...";

	schema:headline " Outstanding Henry James Adaptation";
	schema:reviewBody "Certainly among the finest literary adaptations The Heiress was based on Henry James's novel Washington Square and features arguably Olivia de Havilland's finest screen performance. Morris Townsend  a handsome young man with ambiguous motives pursues Catherine Sloper a plain spinster who is slightly past marriageable age and possesses limited social skills. The young woman who is the heiress of the title is vulnerable prey for a penniless fortune hunter.However Montgomery Clift plays Townsend in an enigmatic manner and viewers can debate his true intentions. Catherine's father played by Ralph Richardson and her Aunt Lavinia played by Miriam Hopkins take opposite sides in Townsend's pursuit of Catherine. Although both her father and her aunt appear to see through the handsome suitor Aunt Lavinia is practical and sensitive to her niece's emotional needs and she counsels compromise in pursuit of happiness if only fleeting. However Catherine's father is unyielding and essentially unloving in his opposition to the match. Throughout Dr. Sloper compares his daughter's virtues to those of his late wife and Catherine comes up lacking in every quality that he values. Sloper threatens to disinherit his daughter if she marries the suitor.Montgomery Clift may appear shallow and transparent to some but in essence those are the traits of his character. While Morris is slick and obviously fawning he is not intelligent enough to be totally deceptive. Only someone as naive and needy as Olivia could fail to grasp that Morris may want something more than her love. Olivia de Havilland transcends her other performances and skillfully and convincingly evolves from a shy introverted girl into a strong vengeful woman. De Havilland has often portrayed women who appear genteel and soft on the outside but whose hearts and backbones can harden into pure steel e.g. Gone with the Wind Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte and Catherine Sloper is the finest of those roles. With able support from Richardson and Hopkins Clift and de Havilland make the most of an outstanding screenplay which was adapted from a stage play. William Wyler directs with a sure hand and the atmospheric cinematography captures 19th century New York life. Period films are often unraveled by their hairstyles which generally owe more to the year in which the film was made rather than that in which the story is set. However even the coiffures excel in The Heiress. De Havilland's hair looks authentic 19th century and underscores Wyler's fastidious attention to detail.With an awardwinning de Havilland performance a handsome Montgomery Clift on the brink of stardom and an engrossing Henry James story The Heiress is one of the finest films of the 1940's. Without qualification the film holds up to and merits repeat viewings if only to better argue the underlying motives of Clift and the fateful decision that de Havilland has to make.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of my favorite movies based on one of my favorite books. Henry James sitting in the audience would have been proud of this insightful filming of his novel Washington Square because the film retains so much of the subtlety of his own writing. Usually Hollywood eliminates any of the subtlety of a great author's voice see the recent remake of Washington Square if you want to see a real Hollywoodization of a novel  it actually depicts a young Catherine peeing her pants in public  an inane Animal Housetype Hollywood requirement that degrading a woman by showing her peeing is an erotic boost for any movie. But The Heiress is pure James. Olivia de Havilland is perfect as James' unlikely heroine going from an awkward gawky girl eager to please her beloved father to a simple loving young woman who steadfastly stands by her lover to an embittered middleaged woman who understands that as Henry James says the great facts of her career were that Morris Townsend had trifled with her affection and that her father had broken its spring. If you liked this movie read the novel. Listen to James' descriptions of Catherine and her father and see if this isn't exactly what Ralph Richardson and Olivia deHavilland portrayed Doctor Sloper would have liked to be proud of his daughter but there was nothing to be proud of in poor Catherine. Love demands certain things as a right but Catherine had no sense of her rights she had only a consciousness of immense and unexpected favors.  'She is so soft so simpleminded she would be such an easy victim! A bad husband would have remarkable facilities for making her miserable for she would have neither the intelligence nor the resolution to get the better of him.'  She was conscious of no aptitude for organized resentment. In reality she was the softest creature in the world.She had been so humble in her youth that she could now afford to have a little pride . . . Poor Catherine's dignity was not aggressive it never sat in state but if you pushed far enough you could find it. Her father had pushed very far.Clifton Fadiman in his introduction to Washington Square says that the novel's moral is to be right is not enough. Dr. Sloper is 'right' he is right about the character of Townsend he is right about his own character he is right about the character of Catherine. But because he can offer only the insufficient truth of irony where the sufficient truth of love is required he partly ruins his daughter's life and lives out his own in spiritual poverty.Dr. Sloper's contemptuous rightness penetrating and accurate as it is is no substitute for the kindness and love his adoring daughter craves from him. In The Rainmaker a great Katharine Hepburn movie also about a plain woman seeking love only this time with a loving father the character of Hepburn's father sums up this moral that to be right is not enough when he says to his selfrighteous son Noah you're so full of what's right that you can't see what's good!".

William Wyler was known for eliciting excellent performances from his actors he's responsible for them receiving a record 14 Oscars in acting more than twice as many as any other director and in The Heiress he's in top form.  This movie should be played in every acting class ever taught to show the brilliance of subtlety and range of expressions possible when one is conveying a character's inner emotions.Olivia De Havilland is a beautiful woman but you believe she's an ungainly bundle of shy awkwardness in the role of Catherine Sloper.  And her transformation to a cruel wounded creature is perfectly believable.  And Ralph Richardson as Dr. Sloper and Miriam Hopkins as Aunt Lavinia are letter perfect beside her. Sir Ralph at least I THINK he was knighted can do more with stillness and a flick of an eyebrow than any actor I've ever seen including Brando Penn and any other method actor you care to toss into the mix.  He was robbed at the Oscars.Montgomery Clift was beautiful and seductive and except for a couple of moments where he seemed too 1950s instead of 1850s just right for the part.  He almost holds his own with Sir Ralph when they meet to discuss him marrying Catherine but he did do better work in A Place In The Sun and From Here To Eternity.Wyler's simplicity and grace in directing only enhanced the story. The use of mirrors to deepen emotional content as in when Dr. Sloper now ill goes to his office after getting the cold shoulder from Catherine is stunning.  So is his willingness to let a scene play out rather than force along the pacing of the moment as so many directors do today as in when Catherine offers to help her father rewrite his will.There are no easy answers in this movie.  You can think Dr. Sloper is right about Morris and only wants to protect his daughter or you can see his actions as those of a vindictive man who blames her for the death of his beloved wife in childbirth.  Morris could be a fortune hunter or he could be a man who does care for Catherine in his own way and would make her happy.  Or all of the above. The whole movie is so beautifully composed it's breathtaking. A definite must see for anyone who appreciates great stories welltold.".

	schema:headline " The Master in WASHINGTON SQUARE";
	schema:reviewBody "Because he so identified with England in his last thirty years and even became a British citizen during World War I people tend to forget that Henry James was an American  as American as his celebrated psychologistphilosopher brother William the good James Boys as opposed to their nonrelatives Frank and Jesse and his fellow Gilded Age novelists Sam ClemensMark Twain and William Dean Howells. His early writings including The American The Portait Of A Lady and The Europeans were written while he was an American citizen. His later classics The Spoils Of Poynton What Maisie Knew The Ambassadors The Golden Bowl and The Wings Of The Dove were written when he resided in England. The novels he wrote through 1897 What Maissie Knew being the last of these were short and controlled in terms of descriptions. But his final set of novels beginning with The Ambassadorshad a more flowery writing as James struggled to find le mot juste in every description. Many like this but I find it a peculiar failure. It takes him three pages of description in The Wings Of The Dove to show Mily Theale is looking down from an Alpine peak to the valley thousands of feet below.Washington Square was written in the late 1870s and was based on an anecdote James heard about a fortune hunter who tried to move in on one of James' neighbors in Manhattan. The neighbor when a young woman was wealthy and and would be wealthier when her father died she was an only child. The father did not think highly of the daughter's choice of boyfriend and a war of wills between the two men left the young woman scarred. James took the story and fleshed it out.One has to recall that while ultimately this is based on James' great novel the film proper is based on the dramatization by the Goetzs. So there are changes one of which I will mention later. But the basic confrontation between the father and the suitor remains true. On stage the father was played by Basil Rathbone and in his memoirs In And Out Of Character Rathbone makes a case that Dr. Sloper his role was not the villain in the novel  it was Sloper who was trying to protect his naive daughter Catherine from the clutches of fortune hunting suitor Morris Townshend. It's a nice argument and one can believe that RathboneSloper was less villainous than Morris. But his desire to protect Catherine does not prevent his cold and aloof treatment of her  he has little respect for her personality. This is tied to the Doctor's constant mourning of his wife Catherine's perfect mother. It enables Dr. Sloper to compare and belittle his daughter.The Goetz play and screenplay show as does the novel that the battle of wills between the two men only hurts poor simple Catherine. There are only two major changes from the novel. First in the novel Dr. Sloper does not discover how his contempt for his child loses her love. He only sees that Catherine will not see reason about what a loser Morris is. So he does disinherit her she only has her mother's fortune of 10000.00 a year not her father's additional 20000.00. Secondly when Morris does return in the end in the novel years have passed and he is a querulous fat man. The dramatic high point when Catherine locks the door of the house on Morris is not in the novel.Olivia De Haviland's performance as Catherine is among her most sympathetic and satisfying ones as she tries to navigate between two egotists and manages to avoid a shipwreck that neither would totally disapprove of for their own selfish reasons. Her second Oscar was deserved. Ralph Richardson's Sloper is a curious combination of cultured gentleman egotist and caring father who only realizes what his behavior costs him when he is dying and it is too late. Montgomery Clift's Morris is a clever scoundrel able to hide his fortunehunting tricks behind a mask of care and seeming devotion to Catherine. Only when he learns that she has broken with her father does Morris show his true colors  suggesting that a reconciliation may still be possible. Finally there is Miriam Hopkins as Aunt Penniman a talkative blood relative who does have a sense of reality and romance in her  she does try to make a case with Dr. Sloper that he accept Morris for Catherine's emotional happiness but Sloper rejects the idea because he distrusts Morris so much. These four performances dominate the film and make it a wonderful enriching experience  as only the Master's best writings usually are.".

	onyx:emotionText "Because he so identified with England in his last thirty years and even became a British citizen during World War I people tend to forget that Henry James was an American  as American as his celebrated psychologistphilosopher brother William the good James Boys as opposed to their nonrelatives Frank and Jesse and his fellow Gilded Age novelists Sam ClemensMark Twain and William Dean Howells. His early writings including The American The Portait Of A Lady and The Europeans were written while he was an American citizen. His later classics The Spoils Of Poynton What Maisie Knew The Ambassadors The Golden Bowl and The Wings Of The Dove were written when he resided in England. The novels he wrote through 1897 What Maissie Knew being the last of these were short and controlled in terms of descriptions. But his final set of novels beginning with The Ambassadorshad a more flowery writing as James struggled to find le mot juste in every description. Many like this but I find it a peculiar failure. It takes him three pages of description in The Wings Of The Dove to show Mily Theale is looking down from an Alpine peak to the valley thousands of feet below.Washington Square was written in the late 1870s and was based on an anecdote James heard about a fortune hunter who tried to move in on one of James' neighbors in Manhattan. The neighbor when a young woman was wealthy and and would be wealthier when her father died she was an only child. The father did not think highly of the daughter's choice of boyfriend and a war of wills between the two men left the young woman scarred. James took the story and fleshed it out.One has to recall that while ultimately this is based on James' great novel the film proper is based on the dramatization by the Goetzs. So there are changes one of which I will mention later. But the basic confrontation between the father and the suitor remains true. On stage the father was played by Basil Rathbone and in his memoirs In And Out Of Character Rathbone makes a case that Dr. Sloper his role was not the villain in the novel  it was Sloper who was trying to protect his naive daughter Catherine from the clutches of fortune hunting suitor Morris Townshend.

However the best performance is given by Richardson as the cold domineering father who wants to protect his daughter but also despises her meek existence. Brown who plays the maid looks like a young Grace Kelly. The cinematography is excellent and there's a fine score by Copland.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is often said that when something seems too good to be true it probably is. That may be so but there are exceptions to every rule. THE HEIRESS is certainly cause for exception.This film carries with it an emotional power that is unequaled by so many films in the history of American cinema. There really are no bad roles in this film and all of the supporting players turn in good performances with what they are given. Miriam Hopkins and Montgomery Clift give tremendously adept performances as Aunt Penniman and Morris but the film is carried to completely different heights by Olivia de Havilland and Ralph Richardson.As Catherine walks up the stairs after being abandoned by Morris it is wholly possible for the viewer to feel the weight of her pain and the burden of her struggle. It almost seems like the staircase is interminable and that she will never make it to the top. When Catherine fumbles around for her dance card nervous and excited due to Morris' attentiveness one might be able to sense her giddiness and want to reach through the screen and assist her. So real and so palpable is de Havilland's performance that even her most seasoned fan can watch this film and completely forget that he is watching Olivia de Havilland this film is about Catherine Sloper and she is the only one de Havilland presents from the opening frame to the end credits.Ralph Richardson gives a performance of equal magnitude in his portrayal of Dr. Austin Sloper. Richardson creates a rather believable rather human duality in the character of Dr. Sloper  after countless viewings of this film I am still not completely sure if he is more guided by love I don't want to disinherit my only child! or spite Only I know what I lost when she died...and what I got in her place.. Richardson tackles each facet of the character with great integrity never once wavering in his skill and performance. On a technical note this film is fascinating for director William Wyler's use of space. When several people are conversing in one area he does not always have them relating to each other all on one level. In the bon voyage scene for example Dr. Sloper stands nearest to the camera gazing away from the action happening to his left. The viewer then has the opportunity to see Morris and Catherine's tender parting moment Sloper's disgusted reaction and Aunt Penniman's giddyuncertain response. Numerous things occur simultaneously just as they would in a reallife situation. The multiple layers of action allow even someone who has seen the film countless times to spot something new and different with each viewing. Further Wyler's use of mirrors and lamp light is stunning as well and serve to set the mood in a rather large rather empty physically and emotionally mid 19th century home.I have said so much already and I know I could say much more in praise of this film if I allowed myself. Suffice it to say this film is a mustsee for all classic film fans and even for people who don't know they are. It is certainly one of the finest in Hollywood history and I am confident it will be discussed for many years to come.".

Certainly that's Catherine's misfortune.

Her true voice comes out in the foiled elopement but it is her father's voice rationality and command.Her father was waiting in vain for her mother reincarnate.She is her father's daughter without the musical talent of her mother or her mother's sociability then called gaiety in times spoken of. Catherine even inherited her surgeon father's talent for stitchwork which is put to embroidery.The costuming and music is fantastic.

	schema:reviewBody "The Heiress 1949Another gem from William Wyler. This is the director of so many sparkling flawless interpersonal dramas it's hard to believe he isn't lionized alongside more famous greats. The problem as he admits in interviews is he had no real style of his own. And yet as the years go by his style begins to clarify a little. Watch The Little Foxes or Detective Story or this one The Heiress and you'll see an astonishing complex handling of a small group of people with visual clarity and emotional finesse.There is no overacting here and no photographic flourishes to make you gasp. There are no murky shadows or gunfights or even ranting and raving. No excess. What you have here is terrific writing thanks in part to Henry James who wrote the source story Washington Square and terrific acting.The three leads are all first rate actors surely. Montgomery Clift a young and rising star Olivia de Havilland already famous for earlier roles including a supporting one in Gone with the Wind and the terrific stage actor Ralph Richardson who received an Oscar nomination for his role. It is de Haviland who is the heiress of the title and she does tend to steal the show with a performance that you would think would tip into campy excess but which just veers this side of danger and makes you feel for her scene after scene. And she took the Best Actress award for it.A good director manages to bring the best from the actors which Wyler clearly does. But he also finds ways to make those performances jump out of the film reality into the movie theater. His fluid expert way of moving actors around one another of having them trade positions or look this way or that as they deliver some intensely subtle comeback line is really astonishing. And easy to miss I think if you just get absorbed in the plot. So watch it all.The story itself is pretty chilling and oddly dramatic dramatic for Henry James not for Wyler who likes a kind of soap opera drama within all his focused restraint. The heiress de Havilland is being pursued by a fortune hunting and rather handsome man Clift and she doesn't realize his love isn't for real. But the father with his slightly cruel superiority sees it all and tries to subtly maneuver his daughter to safety. The result is a lot of heartbreak and surprising twists of motivation.By the end almost anything can happen within this upper class world of manners and appropriate reactions and de Havilland rises to the challenge. It's worth seeing how. Terrific stuff from the golden age of the silver screen for sure.".

Combine a wonderfully told story with a masterful director William Wyler and add to that superb cast and you have the formula for a masterpiece as we do here.Olivia de Havilland gives the performance of her life as Catherine Sloper the socially awkward and homely daughter of surgeon Dr. Sloper played by Ralph Richardson. She brings such a strong performance as her character evolves from a timid shy and innocent young lady to a hardened disappointed and bitter woman. I don't know that I have ever seen an actress give such a convincing evolution before or since. She truly earned her Oscar win for Best Actress. Richardson also delivers a believable performance as the ruthless father that is extremely disappointed in his daughter and never fails to let her know it. At the same time there is a hint of fatherly love below the surface trying to protect his daughter from what he perceives is a fortune hunter in the suitor of Montgomery Clift's character Morris Townsend.The photography in the film is amazing as it conveys the deep emotions in the film so adequately. You feel Catherine's loneliness and awkwardness and the scenes involving the elopement and later the final rejection are quite hauntingly portrayed.One of my favorite lines in movies is from this film when Catherine's Aunt tells her Can you be so cruel? to which Catherine coldly replies Yes I can be very cruel. I have been taught by masters. This is a film you will want to see multiple times to uncover all the layers and details of the very deep and tragic story of The Heiress.".

Olivia de Havilland is almost too good looking to be the unattractive Miss Sloper however her great acting overcomes her beauty and the viewer readily accepts her in the part. Ralph Richardson is perfect as Dr. Sloper. With his disdain for his daughter and his idealization of her dead mother it is easy to see how his attitude has frozen his daughter in her insecurity about everything that she does. Miriam Hopkins is the perfect airhead social climber who does have affection for her niece but becomes so wrapped up in the overall romance of the situation that she doesn't act in the best interests of her niece but in the best interests of the romantic drama that is unfolding around her. In her biography Edith Head talks about researching and designing the clothes for this movie. Certainly the costumes greatly enhance Olivia de Havilland's ability to play this part and be accepted as the plain and graceless Catherine Sloper. A great movie that shouldn't be missed.".

	schema:reviewBody "William Wyler directed the Henry James adaptation of the short story Washington Square with musical score by Aaron Copeland and starring Oliva de Havilland as Catherine Sloper Ralph Richardson Dr. Sloper her father Montgomery Clift the fortune hunter Morris Townsend and Mirriam Hopkins Aunt Livenia. Set in midcentury New York it is a character study of Catherine a guileless plain dull and enormously wealthy only daughter of Dr. Slocum a widower. Catherine has been raised without a mother who in Dr. Slocum's memory was perfection. Unlike her mother however Catherine is an embarrassment as she is sans social graces and incapable of achieving a respectable marriage to any man of her social class and wealth. Her only talent according to Dr. Slocum is she embrodiers neatly. Meeting the handsome Morris Townsend at a family affair Catherine is enchanted with the smooth attentive and socially clever but penniless young man. He is too good to be true and they quickly initiate a whirlwind courtship that culminates in Dr. Slocum refusing to allow Catherine to marry Morris and taking her to Europe to forget him. On their return Catherine secretly meets Townsend who has been charming Aunt Livenia in the Slocum house while the family was abroad and she facilitates the couple's secret rendezvous and plans to elope without the consent of Dr. Slocum. Threatening to disinherit Catherine from her enormous fortune on his death Slocum cruelly informs his innocent daughter that her intended is only marrying her for her money for she has nothing else to offer any man. The truth of her father's disdain and the opportunity to break away from him by carrying out a secret elopement the night of their return from Europe spurs Catherine to agree to Morris' plans. Blindly she informs Morris that her father will cut her off with only a third of the expected amount of her inheritance but they will live on love and she will make him a devoted faithful and comfortable home. At this news and unaware to Catherine Morris promises to return at midnight but instead deserts her. Leaving her waiting for him in the parlor the wizened Catherine is shattered bereft but with her respectability intact. The resolution of Morris' actions and Catherine's newly found mature voice takes on the true Henry James twist with the finest third act of the film left for the return of Morris to Catherine's parlor. Wyler uses the manners and architecture of the 19th century upper class parlor to the full extent through the formal interior settings panel doors furniture and expectations of the kinds of infringements that Morris has enacted on Catherine in subtle ways. When he leaves his gloves on the front hall table Dr. Slocum is aware of Townsend's intention to move in to his home over his objections through courtship of Catherine. Later Morris leaves an empty brandy cordial cigar wrapper and use of the private library of Dr. Slocum's home during the family's absence an act that was akin to dogs scent marking their territory. Instead of taking his leave from a serious fatherdaughter discussion between Dr. Slocum and Catherine over the objections to Morris' proposal for Catherine's hand Townsend manipulates Catherine's unwitting interjections on his behalf to her father and allows a woman to fight his battle instead of doing the manly and correct thing.Catherine unaware of these signs and their meanings until her abandonment stages her own revenge on the duplicitous greedy suitor presenting him with his wedding gift that she's kept over the many years and then orders the door bolted closing the heavy brocade parlor drapes and turning off the lights at Morris' second elopement scheme. As a lamp's light marks her movements up the staircase through a transom window and to the intimate family bedrooms upstairs Morris is shut out from Catherine's heart money and the house he'd brazenly announced to Aunt Penniman was his home. It is a masterful scene that is one of the most chilling in film history.Oliva de Havilland won an Oscar for this performance which is matched by the exceptional performances of Ralph Richardson Montgomery Clift and score of Aaron Copeland. Subtle nuanced and deliberate de Havilland changes on screen from plain Jane to mature confident and attractive simply through her voice hair and posture. It is a gesture that did not rely on gaining weight and shedding it for the role nor allowing herself to don prosthetics which today's actresses rely. Instead de Havilland's tenor of voice is audibly heard to deepen and lower signaling her new maturity in one scene between Catherine and Morris as they plan their forbidden elopement. Miss it and you will have overlooked one of the most subtle acting performances captured on film. Worth viewing and an excellent addition to classic collections of great films Wyler's The Heiress is a significant film to announce the entrance of the postWar American woman to film audiences.".

	schema:reviewBody "The pains of love last all of your life1010.Many people have stated that the only false note in this movie was in the casting of Montgomery Clift as Morris Townsend. I don't subscribe to this thought. The only false note and it's not really a false note that I can take away from this film is in trying to believe that Catherine Sloper Olivia De Havilland isn't a beautiful woman. Yes I know she's made to look very plain and awkward in comparison to the other women in town most notably at the ballroom dance but Catherine comes off refreshingly human while also maintaining a very subtle and innocent beauty. Catherine may be awkward outside of her own environment doing embroidery at home but with the right positive reinforcement either from her Father or from a lover she could be more like the perfect woman her mother. That's why it becomes a source of frustration for Catherine that her father Dr. Austin Sloper Ralph Richardson is constantly belittling her character by judging her through his vision of the ideal woman his deceased wife throughout the film. Does he think he's protecting her from the obvious and eventual pain of rejection she would feel? Or is he in fact just protecting her financial inheritance? In any case Catherine has never been able to exorcise the ghostly perfected image of her deceased mother that her father keeps alive and warm by treating Catherine so coldly. Although Catherine's father is a real bastard you get the feeling that he is trying to do the best thing for her in his own way.One thing is certain the performance put in by Ralph Richardson is nothing short of breathtaking. With Olivia and Ralph putting in such incredible performances it's no wonder that Montgomery gets overlooked. Just remember this was Montgomery Clift's third film and he was still capable of keeping step with two very seasoned actors. While it's true that at times Montgomery Clift invokes an acting style that falls somewhere outside the time of the character he never loses step with the scene or with the other actors.One of the most touching scenes in the film occurs when Morris is playing a song for Catherine on the piano. Morris speaks the words of the song directly to Catherine seducing her while at the same time prophetically outlining both his and her fate The joys of love they last but a short time the pains of love last all of your life.Although it may be difficult for the viewer to figure what Morris' intentions are with Catherine Dr. Sloper has an idea that Morris is looking somewhere beyond love. His distrust of Morris stems from the idea that not only is Morris a likely gold digger but that he actually doesn't love his daughter at all. Dr. Sloper cannot imagine that anyone could love his daughter for who she is. It is this belief that will ultimately be his own cross to bear during his dying days.By the end of the film the transformation of Catherine from a shy and awkward girl to a hardened and abrasive woman is eye opening. Where there once was a girl who hoped against hope for a midnight carriage elopement to arrive there became a woman who had lost all hope for happiness and love while embroidering an alphabet sign made of yarn. Although Catherine has a moment when her lost love flickers anew upon Morris' return she quickly regains an inner strength and cunningly deceives Morris in return by leading him to believe they could rekindle their lost love. Catherine requests that Morris get them that long lost midnight carriage so they can finally get married. As Morris walks out of the Sloper house Catherine requests that the maid shut and bolt the door. Catherine sits back down to finish her embroidery. As she cuts the last bit of yarn from the embroidery she has effectively severed herself from Morris altogether. As if that scene wasn't emphasis enough we get to see Morris' reaction to being locked out. It turns out to be the biggest emotional wallop of the film. Just as the Paramount logo starts to come into frame we see Morris pounding his fists onto the front door through the fading film trying desperately to be heard to prolong the movie anything just to get back inside the house. The wonderful musical score by Aaron Copland swells up loudly to drown out the pounding of Morris' fists as he pounds away silently in time with the music. 1010.Clark Richards".

	schema:reviewBody "There are two sides to every great piece of acting. The way it is performed and the way it is presented. It's a rarely acknowledged and little understood facet of filmmaking but a truly excellent performance is to some degree a collaboration between the actor and the director.In the Heiress we see Olivia de Havilland in what is probably her finest work. De Havilland's entry into motion pictures was not especially auspicious. Her earliest roles required little other than that she look simple and pretty more often than not as the supplicant object of Errol Flynn's affections. However unlike many leading ladies in such a position she emerged as a serious and talented dramatic actress. The Heiress still presents her with quite a challenge though. For a start she is playing a woman ten or twelve years younger than herself. This is achieved not so much by the makeup department but by de Havilland's capturing of the mannerisms of a flighty youngster. She conveys Catherine's awkward shyness not just through facial expressions and vocal delivery but in every move and gesture she makes even the way she dances. But the role also poses difficulties in that the character develops considerably toughens up and has her heart hardened. Again de Havilland rises to the challenge to give a sharp but convincing portrayal of Catherine exchanging her naivet for cynicism.So many top class players have been sold short by their directors. The best directors will not allow you to notice this but much of how we perceive a good performance is in how our attention is drawn to it how long the takes are held for and which aspect of a performance we see. William Wyler director of the Heiress was among the best and also the boldest. One of the things that is great about Wyler is that he is fully willing to show the story entirely from the woman's point of view  something not all male directors seem capable of. Wyler makes it clear that this is not the story of a penniless chancer who seeks the hand of a rich woman or an ageing doctor who is torn over disinheriting his daughter. This is Catherine's story and the audience must feel it from her point of view.How does Wyler make this clear? Very simply by making de Havilland the almost constant the centre of attention. Some directors will put us in a character's shoes with lots of pointofview shots but Wyler is cleverer than that. In many of the earliest shots we see Catherine physically overshadowed by people around her talking over her and acting as if she weren't there. Wyler shows this but through his framing keeping de Havilland clear at the centre even though others are in the foreground he keeps us focused on her face. He makes us see not only that she is in this situation but also how she feels about it. In many of the shots of her talking to Montgomery Clift the camera stays at his back rarely changing angle. This keeps him as a physical presence whose face we never see and focuses us entirely on her reactions. You see Wyler recognises not only that it is important to notice certain things but also that it could be a distraction to see others. By only catching occasional glimpses of Clift's handsomeness and never dwelling on his expressions we remain in line with Catherine's idealistic conception of him.Like twinkling satellites around de Havilland's stellar performance the Heiress also features a fine supporting cast. Montgomery Clift gives a graciously lowkey performance making no attempt to steal the limelight only to appear credible and attractive. Ralph Richardson is restrained and naturalistic but still shows the decorum and imperiousness that marks his more theatrical roles and by the way if you are stuck for a way to describe his beard Wyler's apparent instruction to the makeup team was It must be round but square. Miriam Hopkins for once gives a decent dramatic performance  a nice change for someone who normally only fitted into the ethereal exaggeration of comedies and musicals but faltered in anything more substantial.The only thing I would like to have seen different about the Heiress would be for the producers have stuck to some of their original casting choices and had Basil Rathbone as Doctor Sloper and Errol Flynn ! as Morris. Not that I have anything against Richardson or Clift but it would have been great fun to have seen the old heroheroinevillain dynamic of Captain Blood and Adventures of Robin Hood reunited in these very different circumstances. And I'm sure under the direction of William Wyler Rathbone and Flynn would have turned in very worthy performances quite possibly the best of their career. And so long as they were opposite Olivia de Havilland  who is truly irreplaceable in this role  the drama could not suffer.".

	schema:headline " A landmark horror film which is still as powerful and disturbing as ever.";
	schema:reviewBody "'The Last House On The Left' is easily Wes Craven's most important movie. It was one of the most notorious movies of the early 70s but seems to be half forgotten now despite being a groundbreaking horror film that opened up territory that had previously not been seen on screen. Romero's 'Night Of The Living Dead' deserves some acknowledgement as being the most realistic horror movie up until that point the late 60s but even that had a supernatural element something 'Last House On The Left' eschews. Craven took the contemporary setting and natural performances of NOTLD and added some graphic violence and a confrontational rape sequence most likely inspired by Peckinpah's 'Straw Dogs' released the previous year and made it into something quite unlike anything seen before. This made it the father of all subsequent serial killer dramas. 'Last House...' is still a very nasty and disturbing movie thirty years after it was originally released. Craven was a beginning as a film maker and the budget was minimal so the movie is rough and crudely made at times but the best sequences have an almost documentary feel which gives it an appearance of realism that makes it sometimes really difficult to watch. The acting in the movie is variable. Mari's parents and the comic relief cops who include Martin Kove later to appear in 'Death Race 2000' and countless action movies! are pretty awful but the two girls Sandra Cassel and Lucy Grantham are both very natural and believable and Craven REALLY lucked out with Krug and his gang who are all very very good. Krug is played by David Hess who also composed and sang the songs on the soundtrack something which makes him pretty unique! Hess wrote Elvis' 'All Shook Up' and 'I Got Stung' and yet his performance as Krug is totally convincing. Krug is still one of the creepiest and most repellent killers ever seen on screen. Comedian Marc Sheffler gives an interesting performance as Krug's junkie son Fred J. Lincoln now a porno director I believe! is excellent as the aptly named Weasel and Jeramie Rain is surprisingly good as Sadie who brings to mind some of Manson's girls. These four actors are outstanding and really help make the movie into an unforgettable experience. Their scenes in the woods with the girls are still as powerful and disturbing as ever. 'Last House On The Left' is hardly the kind of movie you enjoy but I think it's a very important movie and still the best thing Wes Craven has been involved with. It's really quite difficult to believe that Craven made something so uncompromising and nasty as this! I highly recommend 'The Last House On The Left' to anybody interested in the development of horror screen violence or disturbing movies of any kind. But be warned it is NOT easy viewing and may be difficult for many people to take. I think it is worth it as it's still an extraordinary piece of work!".

	schema:headline " The most flawed masterpiece of all time";
	schema:reviewBody "Night of the Living Dead and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre are two films that received a unanimous critical bashing when they were first released but are now looked upon as groundbreaking horror masterpieces. That is also a classification that could be used to describe Wes Craven's Last House on the Left but after 27 years the film still hasn't quite gotten the respect it deserves and its greatness only seems to be recognized primarily among horror fans. While it is certainly not Craven's most polished film I still consider it to be his best and indeed Craven has acknowledged many times that he doesn't even want to ATTEMPT to equal it. Last House was the first movie that aimed to show an audience what the REAL effects of violence were and the lowbudget documentarylike realism that Craven brought to the proceedings allows it to pack a bigger punch than a thousand professional studio films ever could. Yes the movie has more than its fair share of flaws but it is a measure of the film's power that one can easily overlook them. The most flawed masterpiece of all time may be a strange way to describe a film but that would be an accurate way to describe Last House on the Left.As virtually everyone knows the basic plotline is a reworking of Ingmar Bergman's Virgin Spring but Craven does a superb job of translating the story's details to a 1970s setting. Two teenage girls Mari Sandra Cassel and Phyllis Lucy Grantham go into the big city for a rock concert only to encounter three of the most memorable villiains in film history Krug David Hess Weasel Fred Lincoln and Sadie Jeramie Rain who are also accompanied by Krug's heroinaddicted guiltridden son Junior Marc Sheffler. The gang of escaped convicts kidnap the girls and proceed to rape and murder them but when they seek shelter at the nearest house they are stunned to find that their hosts just happen to be Mari's parents  who unleash violent tendencies that they would have never thought possible once they discover that they are housing their daughter's killers.The long painful section of the film where the killers torture and murder the girls is where Last House on the Left impresses the most. Before these scenes the villains have been presented as normal funny almost likable individuals which makes their despicable actions all the more shocking. Craven shoots the scenes of degradation with the raw feel of a documentary and while this is mostly due to his minuscule budget and lack of filmmaking experience it lends an uncomfortable air of authenticity to the events. He also demonstrates his ability to toy with the audience's emotions by intercutting the horror with slapstick scenes involving two inept cops who run into all sorts of misadventures while searching for Krug and his gang. While the idea of mixing the violence with humour is an effective one and works well during some of his climactic scenes the cop scenes are done in such broad overthetop fashion that they provide way too much of a contrast with the film's disturbing moments. However when the girls' death scenes do occur they are protracted and extremely intense and during the rape and murder of Mari the killers actually give off expressions of shock and remorse for what they have done. Back in 1972 this approach to screen violence was unheardof.The outstanding work of the unknown cast is what makes the film as effective as it is. Cassel and Grantham make extremely believable and sympathetic victims though the real acting honours go to the villains. Hess who also composed the film's dated but often effective score is truly remarkable in his role making Krug into one of the most unforgettable screen psychopaths and he is almost matched by veteran porn director Lincoln's surprisingly effective turn as Weasel presenting him as a humorous laidback character that is capable of shocking coldblooded violence. But while the film is often quite disturbing it also has plenty of entertainment value. When the violence is not being displayed the tone is very tongueincheek as Craven provides plenty of sharp dialogue and effective bits of black humour. In particular the infamous scene where Weasel meets his painful revenge from Mari's mother and the dynamite dream sequence that precedes it manage to be both shocking and oddly entertaining at the same time. But it is the film's antiviolence statement that makes Last House so memorable as Craven does not allow his characters to feel any satisfaction for their vicious actions. This is easily one of the ten most important horror films of all time and a real personal favourite of mine. It demands to finally be recognized as the true groundbreaking achievement that it is.".

Also despite a filmic precursor it just may be the earliest example of the horror subgenre of brutal realist tragedy that's more a description than a name but I haven't spent much time trying to come up with a catchy moniker. However it has flaws that would be difficult to overlook in a distanced rather than objective or unbiased neither of which I think are possible assessment of the film.The story although claimed as true is an adaptation of Ingmar Bergman's Jungfrukllan aka The Virgin Spring 1960. Roughly it is the story of Mari Collingwood Sandra Cassel. We see Mari at home with her almosthip parents. Mari is about to head out to a Bloodlust concert in New York City with her new friend Phyllis Stone Lucy Grantham. Mom and dad are harassing her about her clothing which is thin enough to show off a bit of flesh but they're not so unhip as to make her change.

Hess Junior Stillo Marc Sheffler Fred Weasel Podowski Fred J. Lincoln and Sadie Jeramie Rain. They're holed up in a New York City apartment. Sadie seems to be group property and that causes some tension. It is suggested that they look for a couple more women. Mari and Phyllis end up at the wrong place at the wrong time. They're kidnapped and mayhem ensues. But there's a twist that arrives when the convict's car breaks down in an ironic location.Frightening disturbing sick and various other terms are frequently employed when describing Last House on the Left. Since I find no films scary I can't vouch for the first term but the other two would perhaps apply proportionate to how many horror films you regularly watch and just what kinds of horror films. If you're not used to the genre in its grittier and gorier post1960s instantiations you'd likely find The Last House on the Left shocking. If you've seen a large number of films such as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 1974 Cannibal Holocaust 1980 Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer 1986 and so on don't pay too much attention to the hype. You're not likely to be very disturbed by anything you see here.That doesn't mean that you'll not enjoy this film. After all it has been a major influence on the films mentioned abovethere is even an important chainsaw scene here. That's especially remarkable when we consider that it was only Craven and Producer Sean S. Cunningham's second film. They had been approached by a consortium of exhibitors who said that they wanted something as appalling and exploitable as Night of the Living Dead 1968.Maybe largely by accident Craven and Cunningham along with others such as assistant producer Steve Miner who later became much bigger names in horrorbetween these three we have the helmers of a number of films in the three major 1980s1990s franchisesHalloween Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street happened upon an unusual cinema vrit style that made the horrific situations depicted seem much more immediate and real. Combined with occasionally graphic and always intense situations of violence and control the final effect is akin to watching a home videosnuff film. In fact it was promoted as such in some areas and the effect was disturbing enough in its time that the film initially received an X rating and was banned for many years in some locales.But again focusing on that amounts to hype now and shouldn't be taken too seriously lest it lead to inflated expectations. Just as surprising on a first viewing is that The Last House on the Left has an intermittent goofy sense of humor and a groovy attitude that is firmly mired in the early 1970s. The two policemen are really comic relief characters and very funny at that but there is also a lot of humor surrounding the criminal quartetthis almost becomes a black comedy at times. These sensibilities even extend to the music which has a frequent hillbilly edge and lyrics that supply expositional material. Surprisingly Hess who plays Krug wrote the music.Despite the simplicity of the story and the fact that the 2002 MGM DVD release is the most complete cut ever according to Craven there are problems with the story whether due to the script or the editing. Too many segues between major plot points are jumpy. The chases through the woods seems a bit random. It's not very well explained how the convicts end up at a home looking as they do. Two characters find another who was missing and it seems more like a dream sequence because of its arbitrariness and so on.But overall the story is effective enough. Although many subtexts can and have been read into the film the most interesting theme to me was that it's largely a tragedy of happenstance. Craven seems to be expressing a strong belief in chance and coincidence and focusing on the dark side of it. Under that reading we can maybe excuse some of the narrative jumps more easily.Although there are a number of similar films that I think are better than The Last House on the Left including Ruggero Deodato's House at the Edge of the Park aka La Casa sperduta nel parco 1980also starring Hess in a similar role curiously enough this is a mustsee for serious horror fans because of its historical importance.".

	schema:headline " Without a doubt the most disturbing film I have ever seen";
	schema:reviewBody "I have seen some films literally dozens of times. They will remain nameless but they are there. Some of those films are pure entertainment and have left an obvious mark on me. I have seen Last House on the Left four times. And there is no film that has left more of an impression on me than this film. It is a visceral experience and one that will never leave your subconscious and that goes for anyone who has seen the film. There are images here that are about as primal as you can go without feeling like you are in a Neanderthal like state. Wes Craven has tapped into something that few if any have ever been able to duplicate. There have been imitations as recently as the summer of 2005 when Chaos tried to usurp LAST HOUSE as the most disturbing film ever made but make no mistake about it. This is the one and only. This film still has an adverse affect on me. The only reason I rented this film back in 1992 was because I was convinced that  along with Jaws and Halloween  Nightmare on Elm Street was the one of the scariest movies I had ever seen. And when I found out that Wes Craven had an earlier film to his credit I had to see it. What happened in the next 90 minutes can only be described as an assault on my senses. Everything that was good in life no longer existed and the fun and happy horror films like Friday the 13th were exposed as the charlatans that they were. It's not to say that they weren't fun films but they were not true horror films the way a Steven Seagal film about war is a quack compared to something ominous like Apocalypse Now. I felt a plethora of emotions ranging from feeling sick to shame fear and trauma. I was so unabashedly disturbed after the film that a three hour head clearing drive in the country was needed to calm my nerves. That is no exaggeration.The story centers around two carefree you women who are going to a concert in the city. They are looking to score some weed and they meet Junior who promises them some and he takes them to meet the rest of the gang. What ensues over the next 45 minutes is nothing short of the dehumanization of the two girls. They are forced to beat each other touch each other and then they are raped and murdered horrifically. There is not much more to say if you do not want to ruin it for those that haven't seen it yet.Was this a good film? Yes. Did I enjoy it? Absolutely not. It left me exhausted depressed and it drained me to the point that I thought I would break down and cry. For a horror movie to do that to me is quite astonishing. I have seen most of Fulci's gorefests but every time you see some guy with a drill through his head you can dismiss is a schlock. You know it's fake. But not with this film. It imbues a realism to it that just makes you feel like you are watching someone's snuff film. It is that macabre and it feels that real. There is nothing else like it. I remember reading a review of Aliens by Roger Ebert and he said that the film was a work of art and he gave it high marks but the film was so much of a play on his emotions that he did not enjoy it. He was terrified more than he had been before. That is how I feel about this film. It is masterfully made but it is a tough film to watch. Even after writing this review I am going to have a hard time getting the images out of my head. So my advice to you is if you are going to watch this film proceed with caution. The subject matter in this film makes 8MM look like Anne of Green Gables.This is the first time the tagline has read so true. Just keep repeating to yourself that it is only a movie it is only a movie......".

	onyx:emotionText "I have seen some films literally dozens of times. They will remain nameless but they are there. Some of those films are pure entertainment and have left an obvious mark on me. I have seen Last House on the Left four times. And there is no film that has left more of an impression on me than this film. It is a visceral experience and one that will never leave your subconscious and that goes for anyone who has seen the film. There are images here that are about as primal as you can go without feeling like you are in a Neanderthal like state. Wes Craven has tapped into something that few if any have ever been able to duplicate. There have been imitations as recently as the summer of 2005 when Chaos tried to usurp LAST HOUSE as the most disturbing film ever made but make no mistake about it. This is the one and only. This film still has an adverse affect on me. The only reason I rented this film back in 1992 was because I was convinced that  along with Jaws and Halloween  Nightmare on Elm Street was the one of the scariest movies I had ever seen. And when I found out that Wes Craven had an earlier film to his credit I had to see it. What happened in the next 90 minutes can only be described as an assault on my senses. Everything that was good in life no longer existed and the fun and happy horror films like Friday the 13th were exposed as the charlatans that they were. It's not to say that they weren't fun films but they were not true horror films the way a Steven Seagal film about war is a quack compared to something ominous like Apocalypse Now. I felt a plethora of emotions ranging from feeling sick to shame fear and trauma. I was so unabashedly disturbed after the film that a three hour head clearing drive in the country was needed to calm my nerves. That is no exaggeration.The story centers around two carefree you women who are going to a concert in the city. They are looking to score some weed and they meet Junior who promises them some and he takes them to meet the rest of the gang. What ensues over the next 45 minutes is nothing short of the dehumanization of the two girls. They are forced to beat each other touch each other and then they are raped and murdered horrifically. There is not much more to say if you do not want to ruin it for those that haven't seen it yet.Was this a good film? Yes. Did I enjoy it? Absolutely not. It left me exhausted depressed and it drained me to the point that I thought I would break down and cry. For a horror movie to do that to me is quite astonishing. I have seen most of Fulci's gorefests but every time you see some guy with a drill through his head you can dismiss is a schlock. You know it's fake. But not with this film. It imbues a realism to it that just makes you feel like you are watching someone's snuff film. It is that macabre and it feels that real. There is nothing else like it. I remember reading a review of Aliens by Roger Ebert and he said that the film was a work of art and he gave it high marks but the film was so much of a play on his emotions that he did not enjoy it.

The story of 2 young girls approximately the same age I was when I saw the film of being abducted tortured raped and then murdered is not for the faint of heart. The brutality and violence was staggering and the film spoke volumes of the depravity of the human soul. I remember driving home with my girlfriend after watching this and both of us were dead silent each contemplating what we had watched and knowing that something like that could happen to us. This movie is one I know without a doubt that I will never again watch and now being the parent of a daughter myself I could never watch it and then allow her out of the house again. This is not a monster movie the MONSTERS are human and all too real especially in today's society filled with Ted Bundy's and The Green River Killer this movie hits too close to home and leaves the viewer depressed and saddened at what human beings are capable of doing to other innocent people. Watch it if you dare but be prepared to be left with a very hollow feeling after it is over.".

	schema:headline " How did Wes Craven go from this to the Nightmare on Elm Street comedies??";
	schema:reviewBody "I watched The Last House on the Left having only recently gone back and watched The Texas Chainsaw Massacre again and learning that I simply don't enjoy abrasive horror films like that. They are extremely wellmade and very effective but they are effective to the point that I don't find them all that fun to watch the way I enjoy watching even the campiest scary movies. I also realized that there is a much more distinct line between horror movies and scary movies than I had previously realized. Horror movies like Texas Chainsaw and Last House on the Left are not scary they're horrible. Conversely scary movies hopefully are actually scary although all too often they're not either but are rarely horrible mostly because excesses of gore and whatnot often render them campy separating them from reality and allowing you to laugh while someone is being brutally killed.Last House on the Left is a horror movie not a scary movie. It is not scary for a second but the fact that it is presented in this almost documentarylike way and involves very realistic characters make it that much more effective. Given that I was so recently sickened once again by Texas Chainsaw I was expecting something equally abrasive from Last House on the Left which I decided to see after seeing an excellent documentary about horror film history called The American Nightmare.The movie was clearly a groundbreaking film at the time of its release and you can clearly see throughout the film scenes that were influential to popular horror films that have come out over the years. I was reminded of some cheesy backwoods movies that also came out in the 1970s like 'Gator Bait and the disturbing I Spit on Your Grave which both have a similar feel to Last House on the Left but oddly do not have nearly the effect of novice director Wes Craven's early film. I have a feeling that this may be because Craven had significantly less goofy caricatures in his movie than either of the 'Gator Bait films or I Spit on Your Grave both of which are hugely overshadowed by Last House on the Left which in turn was eclipsed by the classic Deliverance the same year. In watching the interviews with Wes Craven and producer Sean Cunningham on the DVD it is clear that the movie turned out to be a lot more than they had expected it to mostly because it was so disturbing that there were people who didn't want either of them to ever be allowed to work in film again and it's not hard to see why they were so upset. More than 30 years later the film remains effectively disturbing and upsetting simply because it portrays real people doing horrible things to other real people. There are simple situations in the movie where you may find yourself wideeyed with shock at something that could easily be created by a few people with a home video camera. The success with which Craven and Cunningham were able to make such an effective film with little to no budget ranks Last House on the Left with other low budget classics like Texas Chainsaw and Night of the Living Dead although it now retains considerably less notoriety possibly because of the lack of a whole line of sequels.I have to say that I really enjoyed the police officers in the movie a sheriff and his deputy whose jawdropping stupidity surpasses even that of all of the law enforcement in First Blood. The campy gestures like the sheriff slapping his forehead and rubbing his chin helplessly at his inability to commandeer a chicken farmer's truck when their own car ran out of gas gosh darn it. The comic relief is unusually starkly contrast with the rest of the movie but it's a good thing it's there otherwise the movie would be even more difficult to watch. While it's true that it is an uncomfortable experience watching the movie and I've recently decided I don't enjoy things like that you have to respect the skill with which it was put together. Not just the level of depravity that Craven and Cunningham managed to reach but the way they were able to come up with ways to put the film together when they had such limited resources. From a technical standpoint the movie is a huge success because of that. Not quite as much fun as some of his later movies and not quite as bad as some of his later movies but Last House on the Left performs some things that remain almost unheard of in the movies especially horror movies such as the fact that it contains full frontal nudity and extensive and brutal violence but glorifies neither. The simple fact that this movie can be as graphic as it is without being exploitative is enough to show that even after three decades there is still something to be learned from it.".

	onyx:emotionText "I watched The Last House on the Left having only recently gone back and watched The Texas Chainsaw Massacre again and learning that I simply don't enjoy abrasive horror films like that. They are extremely wellmade and very effective but they are effective to the point that I don't find them all that fun to watch the way I enjoy watching even the campiest scary movies. I also realized that there is a much more distinct line between horror movies and scary movies than I had previously realized. Horror movies like Texas Chainsaw and Last House on the Left are not scary they're horrible. Conversely scary movies hopefully are actually scary although all too often they're not either but are rarely horrible mostly because excesses of gore and whatnot often render them campy separating them from reality and allowing you to laugh while someone is being brutally killed.Last House on the Left is a horror movie not a scary movie. It is not scary for a second but the fact that it is presented in this almost documentarylike way and involves very realistic characters make it that much more effective. Given that I was so recently sickened once again by Texas Chainsaw I was expecting something equally abrasive from Last House on the Left which I decided to see after seeing an excellent documentary about horror film history called The American Nightmare.The movie was clearly a groundbreaking film at the time of its release and you can clearly see throughout the film scenes that were influential to popular horror films that have come out over the years. I was reminded of some cheesy backwoods movies that also came out in the 1970s like 'Gator Bait and the disturbing I Spit on Your Grave which both have a similar feel to Last House on the Left but oddly do not have nearly the effect of novice director Wes Craven's early film. I have a feeling that this may be because Craven had significantly less goofy caricatures in his movie than either of the 'Gator Bait films or I Spit on Your Grave both of which are hugely overshadowed by Last House on the Left which in turn was eclipsed by the classic Deliverance the same year.

It reaches a certain level of starkness never seen before and in many ways rarely since.  No teasers of cosmic revelations here.  The girls as in most true life crimes are killed simply because they 'were in the wrong place at the wrong time'.  The scene also allows for some interesting multifaceted observations of the characters.  The teens are typically rebelious yet one reverts to a childhood prayer just before she is killed.  The killers are savage and brutal.  Yet when the crime is over look at the scene with a certain disgust and shame.  The ending scene at the parents house although done for metaphorical purposes is redundant overblown and not as effective. Sure apple pie suburban mom would be upset to meet her daughters killers but would that be enough to do fellatio on a scummy stranger just as a way to kill him?  Overall it's the scenes that work that give this film it's vintage stature. Actor Hess creates a incredibly viscious and intense villiain.

	schema:reviewBody "The Last House on the Left is allegedly based on a true story about the brutal murder of two teenage girls by escaped convicts out in the boonies.Basically this movie is two parts. The first are the scenes leading up to and including the rape torture and murder of the girls by the four convicts. Sitting through this and watching about an hour of two girls getting raped and beaten and stabbed and forced to perform humiliating acts was not my idea of entertainment. I'd never want to be in a situation like this let alone want to watch it. Sure there are certain things in horror movies but this is more like Wes Craven's attempt at amateur snuff. All we watch is the act of the convicts eliminating the girls who they've taken out into the woods somewhere. It's really disgusting and nothing else happens. It's not even like a horror movie and it's really sick to sit through. What was the point of exploiting brutal murders like that for cheesy entertainment? If that weren't bad enough the rest of the movie is just awful. I know it's 1972 and Wes Craven was not yet in his prime preNightmare on Elm Street but this is bad even by bad horror movie standards. For one thing the disgusting scenes of the girl's rape and murders are somehow celebrated with happy folk music. When the attackers all gather around one of the girls including a scene where one of the attackers starts pulling intestines from the girl's wounds they finish and all stand around looking at each other while some weepy song plays with lyrics about being ostracized from the world. What the hell is that?Then there's these interspersed scenes of these two stupid Keystone cop types who might've been able to intervene somehow but ignored that suspicious looking car parked out by the road. The scenes with the two stupid cops are funny and the music is like banjo work that accompanies old silent film slapstick comedy. Where were the filmmakers going with this? In one scene we'll be watching a girl getting stabbed to death and then the next scene is the two stupid cops running out of gas and having to hitch a ride on a chicken truck? Disgusting.The finale is when the four attackers get their just deserts. With no help from the bumbling policeman the parents of one of the girls invites the four strangers into their home thinking they're stranded traveling businesspeople. However they soon learn that these are the people that killed their teenage daughter. So Mr. and Mrs. Suburbanite setup their house and their attackers for revenge. The ending is so drawn out and so completely stupid it's not even funny. This was really one completely worthless horror movie. What a waste of time.".

When the attackers all gather around one of the girls including a scene where one of the attackers starts pulling intestines from the girl's wounds they finish and all stand around looking at each other while some weepy song plays with lyrics about being ostracized from the world. What the hell is that?Then there's these interspersed scenes of these two stupid Keystone cop types who might've been able to intervene somehow but ignored that suspicious looking car parked out by the road. The scenes with the two stupid cops are funny and the music is like banjo work that accompanies old silent film slapstick comedy. Where were the filmmakers going with this? In one scene we'll be watching a girl getting stabbed to death and then the next scene is the two stupid cops running out of gas and having to hitch a ride on a chicken truck? Disgusting.The finale is when the four attackers get their just deserts. With no help from the bumbling policeman the parents of one of the girls invites the four strangers into their home thinking they're stranded traveling businesspeople. However they soon learn that these are the people that killed their teenage daughter. So Mr. and Mrs. Suburbanite setup their house and their attackers for revenge. The ending is so drawn out and so completely stupid it's not even funny. This was really one completely worthless horror movie. What a waste of time.";

Long before 'Scream' Craven was engaged in analysing the fundamentals of horror  audiences expectations representation ethics.  To find a film featuring extended and graphic scenes of torture rape mutilation and murder 'delightful' is to ask a lot of hard questions about yourself as a viewer maybe even as a person.  it's not enough to say 'Craven made me' as he juxtaposes a horrendous gang raping of a teenage virgin with the bumbling exploits of two comedy cops a number of people left the cinema and made their choice.  So did I.The story is a remake of Bergman's 'The Virgin Spring' adapted with surprising aptness to the backwoods of posthippie America.  Birthday girl Mari and her friend Phyllis go to see metal band Bloodlust in a 'rough' neighbourhood.  At the same time a pair of ruthless killers have escaped jail hooking up with their moll and the leader's junkie son.  Mari and Phyllis eager to 'score' some 'grass' man on this exciting night of newfound independence ask a loitering Junior Stillo if he has anything. He invites them into the killers' hideout and the ghastly horrors begin.Right from the beginning the tone of this film is almost jauntily comic from Mari's parents' sometimes sinister fuddyduddy routine to the news description of the escapees.  This comedy comes from a number of sources from exaggerration incongruity or just the sheer strangeness of people with these delicious faces saying certain things.Craven goes to great lengths to compare the two families in a very Bergman way from the pets they both share to the generation tensions.Initially the film had seemed like a reactionary moral lesson  a young girl in the first flush of her burgeoning sexuality her bosom finally developing goes to a violent concert in a dodgy neighbourhood without a bra  isn't she just asking for trouble?  This is classic reactionary liberalbaiting  her parents despite their token protests are children of the hippy ethos father even gives Mari a CND necklace for her birthday. Mari leaves the safe cloister of home for freedom and the big city and is punished for it a victim of the women's lib Krug so despises.Craven sets this up because it makes us feel safe it gives us a position recognising as we do contemporary films on a similar subject eg. 'Dirty Harry' 'Death Wish'.  BUt when he brings Mari back home playing out her destruction in the heavily symbolic forest we realise that his appropriation of Bergman isn't superficial.  Although the film seems to be that perennial theme the external threat to the family Craven shows that its roots are within in Mari's fairytale sheltered upbringing.  So remote that the phone doesn't even work friendless until a year ago Mari's only confidante was her mother.Mari is 17 and yet she is only hitting puberty now.  This biological suppression this unnatural delay finds an outlet in violence  the violence done to Mari to the family the home the wood but also the film's form which veers so wildly in tone.  .Craven isn't the first horror director to take inspiration from Bergman whose terse narratives are full of terrors unavailable to the generic director.  He lacks Bergman's stern parablelike concentration but the transplantation from a mythical Protestnat symbolic space is effective and Craven's style is full of lowbudget inventiveness.  Another possible influence is Godard in the way Craven flagrantly shocks in the disparity of his content and the way he expresses it  the 'horrifying' denouement is pure farce a routine of assorted vaudeville turns.Like Godard one could argue that his progressive experiments are undermined by misogyny  it's always the spectacle of terrorised women that is used to 'subvert' or 'expose' something or other.  It is about times somebody took their cue from 'Deliverance'.  What is certain is that the term black comedy should never be used so lightly again  a film like 'Heathers' or 'War of the Roses' can never disturb a viewer as disturbingly as this.".

That is a sad thing to say when you are talking about horror movies there are tons of really bad ones that come to mind. This is still one of the worst... yikes. I was not going to comment on this movie but after reading so many favorable reviews from other viewers on this site I had to set the record straight. This movie is terrible! I mean this movie is bad! It does not deserve some hallowed place in the horror movie hall of fame. It deserves to sit on your local video store shelf collecting dust. The tagline for this movie says to keep repeating it's only a movie it's only a movie.. well guess what? It's not. It is just a big mess. It is an excuse to put some really poor special effects onto the screen. This film is not suspenseful terrifying or stomach churning. This movie is mostly just boring. Not to mention a virtual clinic on how NOT to direct edit act in or score a film! Crazy banjo music during a ridiculous rape scene? WHAT!?! According to one song in the movie the road leads to nowhere. Apparently so does this movie. People like to say this movie paved the way for such classics as Halloween. I say that is ridiculous. Halloween used lighting camera angles music and story to create suspense and action. Last House on the Left misuses these same things to create NOTHING!!! A friend of mine and I usually rent two or more horror movies per week in search of truly bad movies. We are working on a book rating all the horror movies we can get our hands on. As a result of this we have found many movies that are bad but some are still entertaining. Unfortunately Last House on the Left is on par with such uninteresting drivel as The Howling New Moon Rising perhaps the worst movie ever made regardless of genre. Wes Craven is a wildly erratic filmmaker who got lucky with Nightmare on Elm Street and the Scream movies. He has struggled and still put out some mildly entertaining movies such as Deadly Friend but avoid Last House on the Left at all costs as it is not only one of the worst Wes Craven films but one of the worst horror films ever made.".

Typically the story lines of these films have a woman or in some cases more than one woman who goes through some horrible rape experience and either lives to take revenge on her assailantassailants or dies and is avenged by a friend loved one etc...These films tend to be brutal and realistic in their portrayal of rape and violence and can usually securely be considered in the category of exploitation films.LAST HOUSE is about two young girls out for a night in the city. Along the way they go up to a guy and try to score some pot from him. To make it short the drugdealers three guys and a girl turn out to be escaped convicts. They abduct the girls and take them to the woods where they are then raped and eventually murdered after enduring some pretty strong humiliation. Unfortunately for the abductors the woods where they took the girls are right by one of the victim's parent's house and when the abductor's car breaks down and they go looking for some neighborly help  all hell breaks loose...There are definitely some inconsistencies and faults with LAST HOUSE  most notably the inclusion of some strangely out of place comedic moments  but as a whole that factor doesn't really diminish the overall impact of the film. I also take into account the relative inexperience of Craven and crew during the production of the film. If I remember the commentary correctly the film was commissioned as an opener for another film and Craven and his cronies decided to make an offthewall horror film. Being that these types of strong exploitationstyle films were just coming into being in the 70's and for the raw content that LAST HOUSE portrays  I feel this was a ballsy move on the filmmakers behalves.Highly recommended for any exploitation or raperevenge buff  a definite mustsee. 8.510".

There is no doubt that Last House on the Left is one of the most affecting films I have ever seen. However integrity demands I shave off a number of points simply because the film doesn't entirely overcome the obstacles presented by a very low budget and a callow director.I saw this exploitation flick while working the graveyard shift in a home for retarded adults. I'm not sure why I watched it all the way through since splatter movies are not my cup of tea  maybe I was ready for a change from late80s MTV or maybe something in the film itself held me but for most of the time I was watching it I was thinking this is the worst film I've ever seen hadn't yet seen Plan 9.Then when the action came to its climax it hit me that this movie is actually a remake of one of Ingmar Bergman's blackand white religious films. I was stunned! I found it hard to believe Craven had even seen any film before let alone based one on a work by perhaps the greatest master of world cinema.But Last House stayed with me. Not a year goes by that some unbidden image doesn't pop into my head while I'm driving or trying to fall asleep. Wes Craven despite having made this movie with little money and less experience hit on some awful truth that for the longest time was nameless for me.Now of course I realize that the truth is simply one of Evil American style. While Bergman spent perhaps three minutes total screen time on the violence in his narrative with the rest of the movie involving the characters' inner landscapes Craven spends MOST of the film on acts of violence both physical and psychical to quote Bergman using them as windows into his characters' interiors.And the evil we see especially that of the film's sociopaths is pure.Yes we know there are folks out there without a shred of mercy who would do to us or our children the things done in the film just for a lark. We read about them in the newspaper. But knowing something and seeing exactly what it would look like are two different things entirely.That is why I was wrong at first about this movie. More than any other film I've seen this one brought home to me the vulnerability of my alltoohuman flesh and civilized thoughtpatterns. I and probably you would be no match for the lifesized evil encountered in this film  evil that's so much easier to believe in than the overblown monsters Craven served up to us later.If you like horror flicks don't miss this one. If you don't check out the Bergman inspiration look it up  I promised no spoilers. Either way you'll be hit with a truth you need to know about.".

	schema:headline " Aja sees Craven's 1977 and raises him one HELL of a remake";
	schema:reviewBody "Alexandre Aja you have a new fan.Before this movie was released in theaters I made sure to watch Wes Craven's original endeavor. Let me just start out by saying that compared to today's standards and conventions Craven's classic The Hills Have Eyes seems almost mild when compared to Alexandre Aja's remake. However purists too skeptic to check this movie out should rest assured that the film is very VERY faithful to the original. The characters story and overall progression of events remain unchanged however the quality of all said elements has increased dramatically since the original 70s release. Furthermore like any other quality remake there are twists there are surprises and for people who think they're getting the same film with updated technology think again.The film starts out with the nuclear bomb testradiation disclaimer and from there to those who've screened the original the familiar New Mexico desert setting is presented for all to take in. Make no mistakes though. Aja never misses a beat and he makes sure to take advantage of any opportunity he can when it comes to scaring the living crap out of the audience.After a very vivid and graphic opening the film gets rolling mixing elements of freshness with both nostalgia and familiarity. People who saw the original will know what they're looking at however their eyes will also be glued to the screen due to the overall difference in presentation and cinematography. The familiar gas station attendant is shown to the audience and soon after the Carter family  inlaw stroll in. From there the real fun begins.Aja and his fellow screenwriter did an amazing job adding depth and dimension to the family members ensuring that throughout the course of the film people in the audience would certainly be able to connect with or identify with at least one member of the Carter family. This is accentuated by very strong performances by all the actors. Recognizable seasoned actors are chosen for the older family members while younger relatively lesser known actors are chosen for characters like Bobby and Brenda.I really could not complain with any of the performances. With all the craziness and gruesome things happening to the family the actors' reactions are all portrayed very realistically with emotions deadon with very few hiccups in line delivery. One performance that stood out in particular to me was definitely that of Aaron Stanford Pyro X2 and the upcoming XMen 3. Despite the fact that Standford was merely a year old when the original 'Hills' was released he more than proves his acting credibility and fits the role of Doug very well. He does the role justice and fills the shoes of the protagonist very well. I could go on and on about the performances of the rest of the cast which are all extremely solid but you want to know more about the movie right? One cannot help but compare this film to original. There are 3 reasons I feel Aja's remake tops Craven's original 1 the emphasis Aja places on the Carters 2 the makeup effects 3 the excessive gore.Whereas Craven gave the deformed family clan plenty of screen time in 1977 Aja opts to shroud them in mystery for much of the film's duration. In many ways the family emphasis is almost reversed in either film. Aja makes sure to hide the deformed family members from the viewers until just the proper moment while Craven made their names and personalities as clear as day. I personally think the less information there is about something the scarier it becomes to the person dealing with it. Aja realized this and presented it very well.Speaking of presentation one cannot help but watch in sheer awe and amazement at some of the deformities displayed by the irradiated family members. I personally have not seen such drastically deformed individuals first hand and I'm not sure how accurate their portrayals were in 'Hills' '06 but one thing is for sure they were damn gruesome. Do not be fooled the little child shown in the commercially televised trailer is NOT representative of the rest of the film.And then there's the gore. Ah the gore. Monsieur Aja you are the brainchild of modern horror and you definitely know how to ride with the best of them. No body part is taboo in this film and for all you gore fanatics out there there are no annoying instances where the camera looks away when someone or something is say struck with the menacing swing of a weapon. For all those who've said But I wanted to SEE what happened to him! rest assured you will indeed see what happens to everything in this film.The Hills '06 will satisfy your bloodlust. Alexandre Aja takes Craven's original film and builds on it in just about every way. Better acting better visual effects better makeup better story presentation i.e. no unanswered plot holes or abrupt halts and much MUCH more gore. This film is not for the squeamish and it is my opinion that it will suppress the doubts of any skeptics who upon seeing this film may have badmouthed horror movie remakes in the past.Only thing that caused me to dock it a point were the questionable courses of action some of the characters took. Alas such things may always fall into the category of typical horror movie nono's. Furthermore I wasn't really horrified while watching this movie. A more accurate description would be that I was highly impressed and satisfied.Horror movie fans see this film as soon as you can. Nonhorror movie fans if you see this prepare to have your world rocked.See this movie people it's pure gold.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Hills Have Eyes although a remake of the original was everything a horror movie should be. Typically I'm not a fan of slasher flicks but this movie had elements I like to see in a movie. I don't like to see the protagonists making stupid mistakes the old curiosity killed the cat syndrome I don't like being able to guess the villain 20 minutes into the movie although this wasn't the scenario in this particular movie. I don't enjoy picking out who's going to do die first and being correct. I don't think sex scenes have any place in horror movies. I like things to be important and advance the plot.Although the movie had some MTV elements to it it still adhered to the classic horror movie thrills. The thing I liked about this movie was the fact that they repeatedly crossed the line doing things that you wouldn't expect modern movies to do nothing is off limits in this movie. Horrifying elements that made you well terrified. Lots of boo surprises but also more complex and twisted than modern movies have allowed. I spent most of the movie with my mouth agape... It's not just the gore although there is a lot of that. They didn't leave anything to the imagination did not imply anything...they showed you everything.It was admittedly a little slow at first but then all of the sudden things began to take a turn for the wicked. One thing this movie did that most horror movies don't bother to do is go into character development. Not a lot but more so than a typical thriller will bother to do.This movie was so disturbing I'm not sure I'd want to see it again. That Deliverance mentality...you see it once you're glad you saw it but so disgusting you're pretty sure you don't want to experience that again.Any horror aficionado should see this movie.".

But these terms also accurately describe this brutally vicious upgrade on Wes Craven's 1977 lowbudget horror classic.What would you do if you were traveling through the desert and became stranded amongst a group of geneticallymutated freaks who were intent on killing you? You'd probably die. Granted I would kick all sorts of geneticallymutated butt not an easy accomplishment when said butt has a foot growing out of it kicking right back but the average human would be in some major trouble just like the Carter family.The father looks like he could handle himself in a fair fight after all he is a detective but what are three girls a boy a cell phoneselling geek and a pizza place maybe two of you will get that lame joke going to do against a bunch of unnaturally strong psychos? How will they survive? Will it be through might or strategy? You'll have to watch the movie to find out. And if you're squeamish then you'll most likely find yourself cringing in your seat and watching with your hands over your eyes. The Hills Have Eyes is a movie that knows exactly what it needs to do to satisfy its target audience and it does it well.Case in point... I'm not very vocal during movies. I usually don't clap and scream and hoot and holler like most the dorks sitting around me but there were a couple of scenes where I literally said aloud Ooooooooooh crap! Of course one of those instances was during a trailer for Phat Girlz but one scene of violence left my mouth hanging open for about 30 seconds. Then I realized that my mouth was agape like some buffoon so I quickly closed it.It takes a lot to shock and disturb me these days so congrats go to The Hills Have Eyes for accomplishing that. It comes at you fast and hard and isn't interested in sugarcoating the violence it's about to serve up. The intensity level starts high and never gives you an opportunity to take a bathroom break. I highly recommend you address any and all bladder issues before the movie begins.For me the main drawback of the movie was the hero. You can argue that he was more of a regular guy and not a typical macho hero but I felt he transitioned a little too quickly from a gunhating wuss to an axwielding killing machine. My hat's off to the dog though that canine rocked! Easily the coolest dog in a movie since the German Shepherd in The Lost Boys.I like horror movies Johnny but I liked to be creeped out more than being subjected to a lot of gore. Would I like this? It's very doubtful. I'll make this as blunt as possible this is a movie that contains severed body parts brutal shootings axes to the head a person biting off a bird's head and drinking its blood and disturbing violence to helpless women.If that description turns you off then you know to save your money. However if that fits your style then the movie will succeed in giving you exactly what you want. But I have to say that if you think this sounds like fun for the entire family then I'll have to decline any invitations to sit down with you for a family dinner.".

This is the first studio horror film in years that I've liked...mainly because it doesn't feel like a studio horror film.Funny side note A girl next to me in the theater was silently weeping through the last half of the movie. Guess it made an impression.";

	schema:reviewBody "I dislike the nowadays and boisterous remakes of classic horror movies as much as the next person but ever since the news came that an update of The Hills Have Eyes was in talks I had great expectations towards it. There are reasons for this rather enthusiast anticipation actually. Unlike The Texas Chainsaw Massacre or The Fog to name just two examples Wes Craven's original 1977 screenplay was open for improvement AND Alexandre Aja would be just the right man for the job as his own project Haute Tension is definitely one of the best horror films since the year 2000. That particular film wasn't really a masterpiece of plotting but it was genuinely grim and barbaric and those are exactly the qualities a film like The Hills Have Eyes require as well. The new screenplay follows Craven's original fairly strict except that the eyes in the hills aren't of members of an inbred family anymore but of an entire community of horribly mutated ghouls. Deep in the New Mexican deserts a small village of coal miners once refused to leave the area at the time the American government decided to test nuclear weapons there and now they still prowl the wasteland assaulting travelers that dare to leave the main highways. The Carter family is next on the menu and the mutants really don't care whether the victims are females elderly folks or even newborn babies...Alexandre Aja delivers the exact right amount of disturbing tension and really a lot more gore than you could possibly dream of. Much more than the overrated Eli Roth this young French filmmaker is the new prodigy of horror. Strictly talking in terms of cinema The Hills Have Eyes is also a more than decent production. The dialogs are fluently written and the characters are a lot more likable than in the original. By them I primarily refer to the members of the Carter family as Michael Berryman's charisma as creepy Pluto remains unequaled. Altering the background of the desertpeople into mutants was a pretty intelligent move by Aja though. Despite being sadistic and utterly repulsivelooking bastards these people are basically a sort of victims themselves which brings a lot of extra depth and unsubtle social criticism in the overall simplistic story. I'm sure this film also had its share of flaws like the editing being a little too MTVish perhaps but the thrills and fast pacing were just too overpowering to have me bother about them. Kudos also to the terrific selection of songs the convincing cast of actors and actresses and  last but not least  the personal trainer of those brilliant German Shepard dogs!".

	schema:headline " Horrific Attempt at Horror";
	schema:reviewBody "The Hills Have Eyes is yet another unnecessary horror remake that relies on shock and gore instead of true horror that comes from playing upon our fears.Set in the barren deserts of New Mexico a happy family is besieged by a group of individuals hideously mutated by radioactive fallout from the US Government's testing of nuclear weapons in the area roughly fifty years ago. They look terrifying they murder and cannibalize their victims and communicate mostly in grunts. They are in fact so over the top so hideously deformed that there is no sense of reality to their existence. They are the monsters of this film yet they are not frightening because they do not play upon our fears. They are so fictionalized so distanced from our reality that they exist outside of it and are rendered harmless to the viewers.Watching this film I was reminded of Tobe Hooper's horror classic The Texas Chainsaw Massacre which I consider to be one of the most frightening films ever made. What makes it so frightening is not the attractive teens being picked off one by one what is frightening are that film's monsters Leatherface and his family. They are a family just like the family everyone has. We can instantly relate to them which makes the fact that they are murderous cannibals truly horrifying because the film intimately drags the viewer into their world. Family is a safety zone and to destroy such a comfort as family the way The Texas Chainsaw Massacre did is quite terrifying.The Hills Have Eyes attempts to play up this same kind of familial terror but fails. The family of monsters are of course all hideously deformed. We are given glimpses of a matronly figure and are introduced to a giantheaded father figure who doles out the orders. Yet there is no sense that this family is connected that they are functional that they are even human. The viewer therefore cannot relate and therefore cannot be as terrified as the filmmaker thinks we should be.Yet one more reason why the film fails in creating horror is that it paints the monsters as victims. In the original the murderous mutants were simply murderous mutants but in the remake they are victims of Big Government testing. We are shown a graveyard where the mutants laid to rest the victims of the nuclear testing we are constantly made aware of the horrible effects the testing had on those who linger on even getting glimpses of mutant childrennot children poor things!. If we can feel pity for the monsters in even the slightest ways then they are no longer as monstrous and the horror is no longer as horrifying.On to the much publicized gore of the film. The blood flows freely as a woman's organs are consumed in front of her son a man is burned alive fingers are chopped off and pickaxes plunge into craniums. This use of excessive gore adds nothing to the films in fact it distracts from it. By having so much violence so much ridiculously elaborate gore the film creates a bloody other world for the film to exist in. The viewers are not part of this world so they cannot be frightened by it.In summation The Hills Have Eyes fails completely as a horror film. Its creations of monsters is over the top as is the violence and Emilie De Ravin's American accent. At an hour and 48 minutes unrated cut this film is not worth your time. Rent the original or better yet rent Texas Chainsaw and see how a horror film should be made.".

Be prepared to see a lot of blood gore and guts. This is a remake that is actually better than the 1977 original. You will applaud for the actions of a German shepherd named Beast and even the tech geek Doug Aaron Stanford when he takes on the mutates.

	schema:reviewBody "The question most people ask when it comes to modern day remakes is why remake a classic? but the question I ask of this one is why call it The Hills Have Eyes? Many films have been made before and after Wes Craven's original shocker with similar ideas so why not take the basic plot idea and give it a new title thus making it a new film. Judged on its own merits Alexandre Aja's exploitation horror flick is actually a good film but it loses credibility unnecessarily just because it's a part of the remake crowd. After an explosive beginning which gives you an idea of what Aja intends to do with the remake the pace relaxes a little as we get to know the doomed family at the centre of the piece. While this may not be very exciting it pays dividends towards the end when the mutant cannibals start to get their own way. We follow a family who decide to take a holiday that involves driving through the desert. After fuelling their car the helpful petrol station attendant tells them of a shortcut in the desert but after they have a crash it soon becomes apparent that they aren't the only ones amidst the nuclear hills.Towards the start of the film Aja packs the film with references to nuclear testing which leads us to believe that he wants to go deeper with the plot. However by the end it all feels very halfarsed as apart from a few references towards the mentality of America  these ideas never really bear any fruit. Ted Levine heads a capable cast in a role that is a world away from his turn as Buffalo Bill in The Silence of the Lambs and actually feels a lot like a Sid Haig impression. The rest of the cast have some impressive film and TV credits between them but nobody is a particularly 'big' actor which actually does this sort of film credit. The real stars of the show are the makeup department who do a great job with the mutant cannibals. They all look very realistic and it's easy to believe that the people in the film actually are mutants. The violence and gore is fairly heavy although Aja is actually quite restrained in this respect as it only occurs when needed and never goes too over the top. Aja also does well with the scare factor as he continually creates a foreboding atmosphere by way of lots of scare tactics including the backwater desert atmosphere glimpses of the killers early on and my personal favourite  the voices that come over the walkie talkies.The main reason that this film works is not because of the violence however it's the way that Aja almost makes the audience a part of the central family. The characters are all well defined and realistically done and this means that once we get to the horror of the piece it really is horrific. Aja does go over the top with this towards the end but in general the characters are very well defined and I certainly cared a lot more about the family in this remake than I did in Wes Craven's original. It seems obvious that Alexandre Aja approached this film with care and he definitely did have a lot to live up to after the surprise hit 'High Tension' the year before. The director certainly has talent maybe even the potential to become one of the modern masters of horror but I'm disappointed that this was his second film as I really think that if he'd created something original it could have been something really special. The fact that this film feels like an attempt for him to break into the American market is too obvious also. I do have faith that some day he'll top his debut film  but he hasn't done it with this. On its own merits however The Hills Have Eyes 2006 is a good film and Aja can certainly be proud of himself for doing Craven's original justice.".

	schema:reviewBody "A remake it was... yes a remake and of a classic horror movie too that  was good enough as it was however... in a world of terrible remakes  and sequels this was something that was far from terrible.  I would like to say first and foremost that I was pleased with Aja's  first film High Tension the man has talent and he put it to good  use here A gory insane slasher type horror thriller that was the  opposite of cheesy. It really was creepy and that is extremely hard to  do these days. It had great character structure you can identify with  and care for the people who are going through this hell. Not many  horror movies do that it's not even their job however it worked for  this film.   now that we know the character structure was believable The story oh  yes the story itself which we already seen in the original was a bit  far fetched... but it was interesting and thrilling. In a way  believable because there wasn't much of anything in the movie  happening that one would refer to as bull  like what tends to  happen in most of the rather bad films they make nowadays.   Great fight scenes well choreographed great realistic really  disturbingly graphic looking gore FX the acting for both the victims  and the killers all done well by these mostly relatively newer lesser  known actors who all did great jobs at portraying.   All that I can say about this film in my humble opinion is one of the  thrilling more fun horror films that has came out in the past few  years. Right on par with Texas Chainsaw Massacre this beats the hell  out of crap like the Ring The Grudge Boogeyman The Fog and other  watered down pussified horror remakes. If you want scary than see  this film. But I must warn thee It is definitely not for the faint of  heart so leave the littl eones at home.".

I would like to say first and foremost that I was pleased with Aja's  first film High Tension the man has talent and he put it to good  use here A gory insane slasher type horror thriller that was the  opposite of cheesy. It really was creepy and that is extremely hard to  do these days. It had great character structure you can identify with  and care for the people who are going through this hell. Not many  horror movies do that it's not even their job however it worked for  this film.   now that we know the character structure was believable The story oh  yes the story itself which we already seen in the original was a bit  far fetched... but it was interesting and thrilling. In a way  believable because there wasn't much of anything in the movie  happening that one would refer to as bull  like what tends to  happen in most of the rather bad films they make nowadays.

Or one of the couple of total dislikers? Well opinions about this kind of film are impossible to judge. ad b It is hard to find words for it. Let me tell you my first viewing experience I went with my girlfriend to see it in the theaters. I guess one could choose a more convenient flic to watch with your girl maybe. But the interesting part was we both fell asleep after an hour. From time to time I woke up by the actions scenes with its special gabba sound. And I never fall asleep in movies. It felt like having a disturbing nightmare with you realizing it is just a very strange surrounding. My girlfriend and I left the movie before the ending slightly amused about this surrealist trip. 1 year later I held the The Hills have Eyes in my hands in my local DVD store recalling the special movie experience in the theaters. The gabba music scenes finally got me interested in rewatching it. Maybe I had fallen asleep because of working too much? A second analysis should clearify my opinion....My objective observationsThe nuclear testing areas have mostly been cleared in the USA. The rest is heavily guarded by military area I've been there no way to get in unless you like to be arrested by the military or shot Sounds realistic that common people just walk in there...  The nuclear ignition grounds like the ones the democrat walks into may still exist. But the radioactive dust you inhale there would kill you within several dayshours depending on the kind of nuclear bomb. Guess why the scientiststechnicians wore suits and gas masks to explore the area that were obviously not even the ignition grounds.  The politically satirical parts with the gun raising republicans and the gunhating democrat are attempts to bring some wits or laughs in the movie. Except from that there is absolutely no funny message.  Brutality Showing the gas station guy blasting his head of in detail burning a man alive raping a teenager by two guys aiming a gun at a baby. I have seen many gory movies but this one really showed it all  in total detail. Some movie makers have the talent to present brutality either in funny way Braindead or in a way that tells you brutality is not at all funny Platoon. The first kind is a parodysatire the second kind is criticism. But this movie fails for both categories.  MusicSound is a necessary tool to stimulate a movie's atmosphere. Listen to the action sequences and you know what I mean. I think this added perfectly to make the sadistic and gory scenes even more extreme. There seems no limit to this visual and acoustic slaughterhouse.  The storyline is so low you can tell it in 2 Minutes. Typical logic of splatter movies with mutants without any logical explanations it is the nature of this special horror genre No explanations of the character's motivations the scenery and the plot framework. Of course not this movie only focuses on visualacoustic experience a movie expressing unexplainable homicide  and ONLY that. One remarkable scene is the following The giant mutant gets killed by the democrat sticking the American flag in his neck. This is the only scene that has symbolic character The US have nailed these victims of nuclear testing. Apart from that don't expect any further stylistic elements.In terms of entertainment in its basic sense this movie has not totally failed I have to admit that it did not at all bore me there was a certain fascination how far a movie can go. At least it keeps you wondering how the intensity of physical violence can still be increased Thought this would be impossible after having watched The ThingMaybe showing the raping scene in pornographic detail and killing the baby with a shot in the head could be worth another remake. The next increase can only be taking an axe yourself... In terms of quality of a movie I don't mean high cost CGI effects or expensive cast the films fails on all linesno imaginatory power  no real suspense  too high paced cutting  poor cinematography  poor acting  poor plot  senseless violence  stereotype choice of soundtrackTo sum up Apart from the metaentertainment of the brutality experience The Hills have Eyes is the worst I have ever seen. It succeeded in topping another alltimeworstmovie unfortunately forgot the title. The worst about it is that some people really like it. Enjoy!".

Guess what happens next? The car breaks down! Guess what happens next? Psycho mutants pick off family members one by one. Guess what happens next? A main character emerges from among the survivors and proceeds to decimate the mutants in ludicrous fashion. It's like The Evil Dead meets an even crappier version of The Evil Dead with mutants modeled after that ugly fellow from The Goonies.Lame.And now here's everything I hated about the movie's premise. First of all why is it that Hollywood believes that radiation makes you some sort of super mutant? Shouldn't the victims just get cancer or radiation sickness? But the baddies in this film weren't merely free of such maladies they were in fact enhanced with physical strength and apparent resistance to shot gun blasts 80 foot falls and pick axes to the lungs. Second even if radiation could give you super powers what about radiation provokes a primal urge to kill normallooking peopleand only normallooking people? Why didn't these rabid uglies ever turn on each other? Does radiation poisoning lead to strong communal bonds or something? Third if the mutants have not been eating each other and only been dining on unsuspecting vacationers then are we to assume that they've been eating an entire family of normals each month since the fifties? AND they've been reproducinginstead of having been left sterile? Fourth Doug and Bob abandon their defenseless family to seek out helpand Doug's instructions are to just wander aimlessly until he stumbles upon someone able to provide assistance. Like someone who has a gun perhaps. Like Bob who just goes of by himself like the macho lone wolf no one needs in this predicament. By the way only Republicans can use guns apparently. Thanks for the political commentary Hills Have Eyes.Unredeemable characters making unredeemable decisions. The most respectable protagonist was the dog.Taking a cue from the new Texas Chainsaw Massacre Wolf Creek and The Devil's Rejects the monsters weresurpriserednecks. What is this trope? Do people in Hollywood think country people are frightening? Granted rednecks irritate me just as much as the next guy but I'm tired of seeing these cousindiddlers in every single horror flick committed to film these days.This movie was Godawful. I went to see it in hopes it would at least be enjoyable in the it's so bad it's funny sorry of way but I was just left with deep regret and selfloathing.".

Hey genius' what made the old ones great is that they were simple family lost in desert attacked by weirdos. But this one ooh they didn't wanna leave this nuclear test site and now we're freaks whaaa Oh and also to reiterate just how horrible this movie was I asked a bunch of people why they wanted to see it and you know what the told me? Oh I wanna see it because it has a rape scene in it. Is that what this world has come to? Is that how low we've evolved to as human beings?

The make up artists should have had an Oscar nomination for the mutants. When Ruby takes the baby to protect her and the baby's father searches the house and the deformed kids ask him to play was one of the highlights for me.If it's violence you want then you cannot go past this. I was totally gob smacked by its impact and if you are a horror freak and this does not satisfy then you are hard to satisfy. I enjoyed this more than Wes Craven's original version.A 100 kick butt movie that will take a lot of beating. I will not disclose its plot as it will take away the film's impact.".

	schema:reviewBody "This remake of the Wes Craven classic is nowhere near as good. Certainly it has some great moments and visual images and the idea of a modern family having to fight off a family of savages is a frightening one but some where along the way it lost its teeth. Certainly the fact that the studio asked that some of the more subversive touches of the original baby for dinner anyone? be trimmed doesn't help. It also doesn't help that this film has inspired countless remakes an homages over the last 30 years. Worse I don't know how many retreads I saw in the last year. Why remake a film if you're going to declaw it and then take the same path as every other film maker. Its pointless. Worse its about 20 minutes longer than the original film and as a result this film tends to stagger about for a good while before it seems to get its focus. Its not bad but the remake is better and more out there. Given the choice see the original.".

	schema:reviewBody "Three generations of the Carter family  father Bob mom Ethel and their kids Brenda Bobby Lynne Lynne's husband Doug and their baby Catherine  are driving across the New Mexico desert en route to San Diego. Looking to cut some time off of their drive they unwisely follow the directions given them by the slightly creepy gas station owner and head out onto a dirt road in the middle of nowhere. Unbeknownst to the Carter's another family lives in the high desert hills a clan of irradiated mutant cannibals who set a clever trap for the Carter's. One minor car crash later the Carter's are stranded in the middle of nowhere. Bob Sr. and Doug head off in opposite direction looking for help leaving the women and children alone. When night falls the cannibals descend upon the Carter's raping killing and stealing baby Catherine away. What's left of the Carter's must now become as savage as their tormentors if they want to survive and get the baby back.This is a shockingly faithful remake in some ways and an entirely new story in others. Fans of the original film will be happy to see that the storyline does not deviate very far from Wes Craven's original tale but fans of Aja will be quite pleased with the gratuitous gore on display as pickaxes baseball bats and even po'd German shepherds are used as weapons. The film is very bloody and tense with a grim filthy atmosphere you can almost smell the rotting body parts. Everyone turns in great performances despite some moments of clunky dialog. The desolate scenery is a character all its own hellishly hot and red littered with vultures and crows. My only major gripe with this film was that not a lot of time was spent with the cannibal family. They don't have a lot of dialog and what they do have isn't the greatest. The idea of Family Versus Family that was so prevalent in the original film is missing here and instead it's Family Versus Monsters. Which is fine but as a fan of the original I really would have liked to see the mutants interact with each other more and been given a sense of their family dynamics. And Billy Drago perhaps the most severely underrated actor of his time has perhaps three minutes screen time total and one line of dialog despite the fact that his name is in the opening credits and he's playing Jupiter the head of the mutant family. Will somebody PLEASE give Billy Drago some decent screen time for gods sake! That said I did enjoy this remake very much. It was impressively faithful but it was also willing to present some new ideas. The script is idiotic in several places and there's some downright silly music towards films end but these are perhaps petty gripes on my part. All in all it's a fun two hours of blood scares and horror. As far as remakes go this is one of the better ones I've seen.It may take place in 95 but this film feels very 70sish gritty brutal and nasty. Fans of the original will want to see it at least once as will fans of films like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Wrong Turn.Pretty good.".

You never really care for any. Towards the end you might but only because the characters stop talking. The movie then depends upon the charisma of the actors which thankfully they have. Somewhat. Don't expect any characteristics from the mutants though. Bloodthirsty nothing else. Hell they're obviously breeding but there's only one female capable of it. Plot holes!The second problem with this movie is the heavyhanded politics. They feel contrived forced and too blatant. The family is full of ultraconservatives. Gun loving God fearing republicans. Except for the one democrat though. Sure he's the most annoying of the bunch very whiny but suddenly you know where he'll stand. All of this would be fine if the politics were either subtle or crucial to the plot. They're neither. In fact they almost entirely drop away. It feels like a desperate attempt for depth but comes across as terribly contrived.The last problem is the action. Very little. The first half of the movie is painful. Nothing happens. All you get is annoying conversation and dumb decisions. The second half picks up with a couple of good gore effects but... meh. There's only one interesting action sequence. If you want to go to a movie and turn your brain off and see gore this is maybe a 5 out of 10. Worth seeing but not good. Unfortunately the director decided to add depth to the movie meaning he wants you to think. The movie does not stand up to any form of scrutiny regardless of your political views. It's just terrible. For the record though I thought High Tension was poor as well. Decently directed but plot holes abound. This is a much worse movie. Not directed quite as well much more boring and not a single character worth caring about.".
