If you're looking for a comedy to give you lessons on how to live your life you've got serious problems.I'm still only giving the movie a seven because it's a comedy it's not like it was so moving that it changed my life or anything. As comedies go though I found it pretty good. It's not one of those constant laugh a minute slapstick comedies but the parts that did make me laugh literally made me laugh out loud which is pretty rare for me.

	schema:reviewBody "The Farrelly brothers have had a successful history but their best work was past them a long time ago. Dumb and Dumber and There's Something About Mary are among the two funniest comedies of alltime and put the brothers at the peak of stardom. However their track record afterwards is a heavily mixed bag you find your underrated gems Osmosis Jones Fever Pitch and then your disasters Shallow Hal Stuck on You. The Heartbreak Kid is their attempt to reach back into gradeA stardom like back in the late 90s. Joining with old friend Ben Stiller they attempt to successfully recreate an old Neil Simon story about a man who has second thoughts about his marriage during his honeymoon. What we get is a cruel twisted vulgar outrageous and bittersweet movie that tramples over morality and messes around with the typical romantic comedy formula. Unfortunately though the cruelty in this movie prevents it from being anywhere near romantic. While the Farrelly brothers crafted their best work since Osmosis Jones this is still nowhere near as good as their comedies of the previous decade.Heartbreak Kid is about Eddie Ben Stiller a lonely man who meets a woman Lila played by Malin Akerman during a random encounter and after a few weeks believes that she is the perfect woman for him. However right after the wedding another side of his perfect woman is revealed and is slowly but surely becoming a nightmare come true. Despite their honeymoon being in a beautiful portion of Mexico the honeymoon is a disaster as Eddie struggles to survive being with his new wife. Worst of all during the honeymoon he meets another woman Miranda Michelle Monaghan who seems to be absolutely perfect for him. In this cruel script nobody is the hero and seemingly everybody is the victim in some way or another. Nobody is safe in the movie which makes this story perfect for the Farrelly Brothers.Ben Stiller seems to play the same kind of role multiple times as he has a similar presence to that of his character in There's Something About Mary and Along Came Polly. The only difference is he's a bit more sinister and a much bigger jerk. His new wife is portrayed perfectly by Malin Akerman who isn't afraid of embarrassing herself or showing off her body. Their physical humor together creates the biggest laughs in the movie. The most desirable character by far comes from the best performance Michelle Monaghan of Mission Impossible fame delivers this charming sweet performance as the adorable and beautiful Miranda. Everyone else did a decent job with Jerry Stiller in a throwaway role as Eddie's father and Carlos Mencia surprisingly funny as a manager of the hotel in Mexico.This movie's biggest flaw is its obvious attempts to recreate the surprise vulgarity and bittersweet content of There's Something About Mary. It worked back then but it has trouble now simply because the characters are not as likable and the movie lacks heart. In Dumb and Dumber you knew that they weren't meant to get that dream girl but their persistence and their kindness hidden underneath their stupidity allows for the audience to root for them regardless. In There's Something About Mary the main character goes to great lengths to find Mary and attempt to be with her it became a raunchy and bizarre hero's journey. In this movie the main character selfishly marries and tramples over other people emotionally mind you in order to find his actual soulmate making him not a necessarily likable character.In spite of the lack of heart you will find the laughs no denying that. The new wife from hell routine was spoiled far too much in the previews yet was still enjoyable. Unfortunately once again misdirection keeps Heartbreak Kid from being funnier than it could have been. After a while Lila practically disappears from the movie focusing more on Eddie's budding romance with Miranda. The movie mellows down once Lila is out of the way and then we see a train wreck waiting to happen for about half an hour. If you are a fan of There's Something About Mary there will be plenty to laugh about but none of the content is rich or deep most of the funniest scenes happens to be grossout and shock humor. One unique thing in Heartbreak Kid is pretty crappy special effects which makes it worse for this kind of movie because these kinds of movies do not use much special effects if any at all. Soundtrack also isn't as catchy or as fun as other Farrelly Brothers movies especially Dumb and Dumber.Bottom Line Heartbreak Kid is funny but its not an instant classic nor is it a type of movie to take a date to. While it is not as painfully disastrous as Good Luck Chuck it still pales in comparison to recent adult comedies and early Farrelly efforts. Ben Stiller still provides the laughs through his physical humor and his ability to perfectly portray a man mentally breaking down. However this movie has major morality issues and then really slows down once the romance builds up yet we aren't rooting for anybody because everyone is guilty of lying deceiving and worse except for one character. The directors are somewhat on the right track back to their glory days but still have a longs way to go. They also really need to grow up and try to fray away from the gross humor something that Mike Myers suffers from. Looking for laughs? Look no further. Looking for an amazing film? Keep looking.".

	schema:reviewBody "I can't believe how terrible this movie is. And the Oscar goes to The Heartbreak Kid in the category of the worst remake of a film ever made. Even without comparing it to the original the movie fails miserably in and of itself. I just got out of a showing of the film where there were some initial laughs but by halfway through the movie there was basically dead silence in the theater for the rest of it. This is expected to be funny the crazy cousin hitting each of Ben Stiller's legs with a baseball bat Ben Stiller trying to pull a big pain pill out of Lila's nose with her deviated septum Lila apparently smashing what she thought was Ben Stiller's member a sideshow where a donkey is apparently going to hump a young Mexican lady Miranda's cousins shoving a hot pepper up Ben Stiller's nose Lila peeing on Ben Stiller on the beach as he is screaming in agony because of a jellyfish sting endless hitting and bashing of Ben Stiller by practically everyone including Lila in her sexual frenzy and on and on. The movie commits a bad crime for a comedy  the outrageous antics add up to cringes not laughs. For those of us that remember the quirky extremely clever and funny original the comparison with this ugly meanspirited piece of dreck is almost painful. Other than two of the character's names and the basic premise of a man falling in love with another woman on his honeymoon and a couple of the same lines and plot devices early on there is simply no resemblance. In the original the only bad guy is Lenny  and that's simply because he's devious and dishonest even though one can completely understand and identify with his predicament. In the original version one feels for each and everyone of the other characters Lila in her oblivious ignorance with her annoying not horrificlike in the current version habits Kelly Lenny's love interestMiranda in the remake selfish but coolly beautiful Kelly's overprotective parents  it adds up to a surprisingly perceptive movie with regard to people's hopes and desires. And Heck  it's just so damn funny with truly great clever dialog unlike the newer version. In the new version for some reason the same plot makes no sense and one could care less about any of the characters. When I first saw the trailer for this movie I laughed out loud. It looked like this was going to be a hilarious movie. I had heard how the characters were switched around  which made total sense in a remake not just simply to redo the original but make a new version with its own set of perceptions and laughs. BUT THEN I read a review that said that the trailer contained the only funny moments in the film. I couldn't believe that. But now I do. Those few funny moments that are in the trailer are all that there is to laugh at. Save your self 10 bucks and a couple of extra hours in the day  watch the trailer have a good laugh and then rent or buy the original. A MUCH more satisfying experience!".

San Francisco as well as Mexico look spectacular in this movie. The locations act as another character and add a lot to the movie. The women in this movie are very pretty and likable. Of course nobody should treat somebody like that  but the title of the movie is Heartbreak Kid so I guess what else can we expect. This movie is not Mary but I enjoyed it a lot. It has some weaknesses. We don't really like or dislike some of the characters  the script could have made clearer choices. We don't really root for anybody even though I wished he stayed with his wife  she seemed cute nice enough and willing to change if he just had asked. Overall a typical Farrelly movie very creative fun to watch but some weaknesses to the script. Also many many great performances by actors in supporting roles.".

	schema:headline " After the marriage boredom kicks in!";
	schema:reviewBody "How the mighty have fallen! The Farrely Brothers once upon a time were the kings of comedy with a string of hits under their belts and some laugh out loud movies that included Dumb and Dumber and There's Something About Mary they were truly unstoppable. Then something happened they suddenly made flops or at least disappointments. Stuck On You in my mind is where this all began uneven comedies that while having some good moments were just so unmemorable it was unbelievable. I never saw The Ringer I didn't agree with the subject matter hence why I didn't watch it but I was actually really looking forward to The Heartbreak Kid. The trailer made me laugh and it looked like a return to Mary territory. I went into this movie expecting a short light hearted comedy with some hilarious moments. I came out bored to tears having only laughed a few times and feeling really cheated and also very disappointed. The Heartbreak Kidis unfortunately a big flop and is definitely the Brothers weakest movie to date in my mind. This wouldn't bother me if everything about the movie was unbelievably awful but the most frustrating thing is that there are moments in this movie that are genuinely brilliant. The storyline itself is great the characters are great the tone is right so where the hell did it go some damn wrong? My guess is that studio interference has a large part to play. The gross out Farrely humour just does not gel with the sweet romance story at the centre of it all. Also the movie is way too long and the script way too uneven for this to be a good movie. This may not be the worst movie of the year in my eyes but its certainly one of the most frustrating. Ben Stiller is great Malin Akerman is superb there are scenes and ideas that are brilliant the ending is pitch perfect yet everything else is just so poorly executed!So lets start with the cast which admittedly is the most consistently decent thing in the movie. Ben Stiller is on a return to form in this movie after a few cameos here and there and a phoned in performance in Night in the Museum he finally seems at ease. In fact this is arguably his best work in my eyes since Dodgeball not hard when you see his recent line of work. His natural easy going charm works in this movie and makes a potentially unlikable character and actually at times his character remains very unlikable just a bit more tolerable. A shame then the script gives him little comedy to work with that is until a priceless psychotic breakdown over a Mexican band which is one of the few highlights of the movie. The true star of the movie however is Malin Akerman as the psychotic Lila. Akerman seems to have a blast as the mad former junkie in debt clingy neurotic wife from hell. However I found something very strange while watching this movie I actually felt sorry for Lila for a lot of the film. Sure when she's having sex and beating the hell out of her husband its hard to feel sorry for her but when Ben Stiller is cheating on her its kind of sad. Whether or not this is intentional or not is debatable however. Michelle Monaghan definitely drew the short straw of the group in a role that is pretty pointless and just too unoriginal for me to give a damn about.The humour of the movie and the unevenness of pace is definitely where the Heartbreak Kid literally breaks. The movie does start off quite well sure its not classic but its amusing. In fact the start of the honeymoon is relatively funny but then about the halfway mark the movie just gives up all hope and dies. The jokes dry up the romance and sentimentality factor kick in and the eyes start to droop. Despite some decent one liners the movie just doesn't make an effort any more. You find yourself not caring anymore you couldn't care if Eddie stays with Lila or not you just want the movie to end. And then the film drones on and on and on. And then when you think you have an ending it suddenly does something else. Thankfuly the unexpected ending lifts things up slightly but the standard beforehand is so low it doesn't redeem the movie. In fact take out the brilliant Mexican band running joke the amusing sunburn bit the few sex scenes and a couple of one liners this would struggle its already low 510 rating.The Heartbreak Kid is really a movie I cannot recommend as it is way too disappointing. The cast do an admirable job with little material and the idea is there. A better movie is probably underneath this wretched turd somewhere but unfortunately for now this movie remains just another lame addition to the Farrely brothers already struggling CV. The Farrely brother may have once been the kings of gross out comedy but in an age when we have Knocked Up and Superbad maybe its time they gave up and tried something else.".

This film is great has a lot of funny moments terrific cast and a rocking soundtrack. Who wants more than 1 hour and a half of pure fun laughs and weird moments. The story is simple Eddie Ben Stiller is a bachelor who finds what seems to be the perfect girl. He marries her only to find that she's a living nightmare. Later he meets another girl and wind up falling in love with her. That's where the fun begins when he gets into a terrible mess with his wife and his new affair. The film is not politically correct but fun don't have to be correct. Fun is fun and is meant to make you laugh and the film truly deliver the goods. If you are too moral about wedding loyalty good manners please don't see this movie cause you probably will not like it. The ending really surprised me. I thought it was going to be something like sweet and warm. Instead we have a real life nonmoral type of ending.".

	schema:reviewBody "What a heartbreak it must have been for the quirky director siblings The Farrelly Brothers when their latest outlandish comedy The Heartbreak Kid broke in as a box office disappointment. It did not help matters much when critics did not have a heart and ripped it to shreds. However I am not one of those critics probably because I do not have the certification to be a critic. All kidding aside I thought The Heartbreak Kid was a laugh riot! Let me break the narrative to you. Ben Stiller stars as Eddie Cantrow a San Francisco sporting goods owner who marries Lila a woman he has only known for six weeks. Lila is played by the upandcoming Malin Akerman. The movie is primarily set in Cabo Mexico which is where Eddie and Lila go on their honeymoon. In Cabo Eddie discovers that Lila is not the woman he thought she was and before you could say se acabo in Cabo he craves to stay apart from loony Lila. In Cabo Eddie also meets a Mississippi cutie redneck woman named Miranda played also by another upandcoming actress Michelle Monaghan. Mr. Eddie all of a sudden wants to horse around with Miranda behind his wife's back. Plot twists eventually get more zany  bizarre and of course what is a Farrelly movie without some Farrellycious gross comedy. Stiller Akerman and Monaghan did put their heart into their commendable comedic performances. Also some other praiseworthy acting broke into The Heartbreak Kid in the form of Jerry Stiller playing Eddie's dad Doc Rob Corddry playing Eddie's follicle challenged best friend Mac and Danny McBride playing Miranda's overprotective redneck cousin Martin. The Farrelly Brothers farout comedy does go into a rollercoaster turn at times but it was riding way high in most of The Heartbreak Kid. I thought The Heartbreak Kid was in the apex of comedic popcorn entertainment for 2007 and I do wholeheartedly mean that.  Excellent".

	schema:reviewBody "After 3 watereddown toothless flicks Shallow Hal Stuck on You and Fever Pitch The Heartbreak Kid was The Farrelly Brothers' return to raunchy comedy. Trying to recapture the greatness of their biggest hit There's Something about Mary they hired Ben Stiller and a Cameron Diaz lookalike. The end result is heartbreakingly mediocre. The film which tells the story of a newlywed Stiller whose bride Akerman goes loco only a couple of hours after their wedding just isn't funny. In fact all the good jokes were in the trailer. The remaining jokes either missed the mark anything that has to do with Monaghan's Miranda or were removed altogether from the Egyptian theatrical version apparently there's a hilarious love sequence. In addition due to sloppy writing I found myself rooting for the bad guy Akerman's Lila and thought Stiller's Eddie was a jerk as he cheated on his wife during their honeymoon. If that wasn't enough the film is far too long over 2 hours and the last 30 minutes are so dark for a comedy that they're painful to watch. The film's only redeeming factor is Akerman who gives a charming performance. But even Akerman's charm can't save this trainwreck.".

But perhaps the most memorable and highly rated laughfest will be his starring in the Farrelly Brothers' There's Something About Mary with Matt Dillon and Cameron Diaz as the ditzy blonde the two guys are trying to go after.The Heartbreak Kid brings Stiller back to the Farrelly Brothers' fold joining forces again to bring in the laughs in a situation that unmarried guys my age fear. While we may be nonchalant about staying single and enjoying the status to sow our wild oats there's always this nagging thought about what would happen when we seem to have met that special someone who could be just the very person to spend the rest of our life with. Thinking about forever that it's a long time make us go into weighing in the pros and the cons of giving up our freedom and we just want to be darn sure and suicidal to be giving up our singlehood.And for forty year old Eddie Stiller he shares the same sentiments but on the advise of best buddy Mac Rob Corddry who himself is a henpecked husband and Casanova dad Doc Jerry Stiller Ben's real father he marries Lila Malin Akerman the blonde akin to Cameron Diaz's Mary in the earlier FarrellyStiller collaboration on a whim after six weeks of courtship. While on the surface she's physically da bomb and might seem all nice and dandy inside little does Eddie know the nightmare is about to begin as he discovers say what? they share very little interests she's the archetypal dumb blonde always made fun of in blonde jokes and she's a sexual nymph who likes it very rough ok so some of us out there might take this as a plus point.If there's a moral to the story that will be to consider very carefully and to take your time before you commit to that matrimonial vow. You might call me oldfashioned but I believe that once you walk down that aisle you'll just have to stick with the woman you marry for better or worse and learn to accept her faults. After all nobody's perfect. But this is a movie so if anyone is holding onto such realworld ideal notions then you'll probably not have a good time and start to frown at every Eddie antic at his horror of discovery and worse when he starts to develop feelings for Miranda Michelle Monaghan last scene on the big screen playing Ethan Hunt's wife in MIIII an equally attractive woman who probably shares more of the same interests as Eddie whom he met while on honeymoon.Wait a minute cheating on your wife during honeymoon? Yes which is why the conservatives out there will leave with a bad aftertaste. But for the rest of us it examines the type of dilemma for someone having second thoughts after all these are fertile grounds for affairs. The narrative starts to junk the comedy and move into romancedrama gears but lest you forget this is still a Farrelly Brothers' movie their trademark sexually vulgar scenes and jokes come and surprise you when you least expect. Body parts there's this scene involving bodily fluids which you just have to see to believe the insane audacity of it all and orifices are no longer sacred. Comedy of errors are standard fare as are the increasing inserts of gay jokes whenever possible. However most jokes were still on Lila and plenty of that were already included in the trailer so if you haven't watched it don't.As a comedy The Heartbreak Kid somehow didn't live up to its promise. Sure it has its moments but they were few and far between and in reality you'll probably enjoy the Eddie Miranda romantic scenes and those with her family a lot more than you would the Eddie Lila comedic scenes. Does it have an ending and resolution to Eddie's dilemma of which girl to choose? Yes but it turned out to be extremely clunky and unfunny try as it would want to dragging out the last act unnecessarily to put this movie close to a two hour runtime. It's still a comedy after all so don't expect a very powerful and emotional close ala dramatic fare like Castaway which it tried to ape with a comedic slant of course.Deinitely not one of Stiler's or the Farrelly Brother's best work to date. Stay tuned for the cameo appearance of one prominent TV actress at the close and stay tuned during and after the end credits. There's a scene involving Lila which probably isn't in very good taste showing how she managed to get satisfied and the other bringing you back to 1975 to confirm a certain event which was mentioned in passing.".

	schema:headline " This was possibly the most uncomfortable movie I have ever seen";
	schema:reviewBody "And that's incredibly sad after seeing Pink Flamingo's last year I mean The Heartbreak Kid was just one of the most stupid films I have seen. There was absolutely nothing funny about this movie and I don't understand it's rating. The Farally brothers have lost their gift because I have no idea what they were smoking when they came up with this film and thought it would be a good idea. Ben Stiller also I mean his character was absolutely the biggest jerk I have ever seen on film and was in no way likable. I think that was the main problem I was having with this movie was due to the fact that I think Ben Stiller's character was supposed to be likable but there was no saving him from the way this script was written because he is in no way justifiable. The Heartbreak Kid was definitely the worst film of 2007.Eddie is starting to feel a bit alone in the world filled with love sick couples. But that all changes when he meets a beautiful girl Lila and after 6 weeks of dating her she needs to go to a different country for a job but Eddie is feeling so good that with the pressure from his dad and friend he marries her. They go on their honeymoon and Eddie finds out that Lila have some disturbing traits to her personality. But his vacation quickly changes when he meets Miranda who is on a family reunion and he falls in love with her. But of course since he's still technically married it gets hard to tell Miranda.The Heartbreak Kid has some of the most uncomfortable nudity I've ever seen. I have no problem with nudity in films depending on the context but this script was so awful like how Lila loved being a freak in bed. OK I get it after the first scene but they continue this weird joke for a few more scenes not to mention her jellyfish scene with Ben was beyond gross.

	onyx:emotionText "And that's incredibly sad after seeing Pink Flamingo's last year I mean The Heartbreak Kid was just one of the most stupid films I have seen. There was absolutely nothing funny about this movie and I don't understand it's rating. The Farally brothers have lost their gift because I have no idea what they were smoking when they came up with this film and thought it would be a good idea. Ben Stiller also I mean his character was absolutely the biggest jerk I have ever seen on film and was in no way likable. I think that was the main problem I was having with this movie was due to the fact that I think Ben Stiller's character was supposed to be likable but there was no saving him from the way this script was written because he is in no way justifiable. The Heartbreak Kid was definitely the worst film of 2007.Eddie is starting to feel a bit alone in the world filled with love sick couples. But that all changes when he meets a beautiful girl Lila and after 6 weeks of dating her she needs to go to a different country for a job but Eddie is feeling so good that with the pressure from his dad and friend he marries her. They go on their honeymoon and Eddie finds out that Lila have some disturbing traits to her personality. But his vacation quickly changes when he meets Miranda who is on a family reunion and he falls in love with her. But of course since he's still technically married it gets hard to tell Miranda.The Heartbreak Kid has some of the most uncomfortable nudity I've ever seen. I have no problem with nudity in films depending on the context but this script was so awful like how Lila loved being a freak in bed. OK I get it after the first scene but they continue this weird joke for a few more scenes not to mention her jellyfish scene with Ben was beyond gross. This was just an unnecessary film in every aspect the script needs at least some major work because the characters are awful and so is the story. Please stay away from this junk it's not worth your time.110";

I've been to Cabo and as far as I know there's no such thing as the burro attraction. In Mexico we have cars  bikes motorcycles and everything they have in any other country!!! Then Ben Stiller talks about chimichangas. That's not even Mexican!!! That's TExMex!!! WTF??????? Guacamole certainly is but there are other dishes more representative of true Mexican food! The worst commentary is the one made by the girl that married Stiller who says Mexico being a third world country is a very dangerous place and not satisfied with that during the whole movie she keeps on talking bad things about Mexican stuff. That's really annoying.As a Mexican I judge this movie as a total piece of rubbish and you would certainly find it too even though you weren't a Mexican.".

	schema:reviewBody "On December 10th 2007 the seemingly impossible happened. Zed Zeppelin the world's original super group and one of the few bands in history who could rival The Beatles for fame and popularity at their height reformed for a one off concert at London's O2 Arena for the Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert. The show set a world record for ticket demand with over twenty million people including myself registering online for a chance of one of the 20000 tickets. Like close to twenty million others I didn't get a ticket for a show that myself and other fans had been waiting for for over twenty five years.Fast forward nearly five years to October 17th 2012 and the concert was screened for one day worldwide in cinemas ahead of a DVD and Blu Ray release on November 19th. This time demand wasn't so high and I managed to get two tickets for a screening at my local multiplex. While in no way the same as seeing the band my favourite of all time live the two hours I sat in the cinema were amazing. The band showed that despite having barely played together in thirty years and missing original drummer John Bonham whose death in 1980 was the trigger for the band's breakup that they are still able to rock with the best and sounded close to as good as they have on any other live recording I've seen.One of the problems with seeing a band like Led Zeppelin at the cinema is that it isn't the sort of environment that you can really relax singair guitar or dance in. It was a little awkward at times as a few people bobbed heads or tapped feet. I didn't feel as though I could properly enjoy the show in that environment and think that it is probably better suited to DVD. I had to resist the urge to sing and clap which isn't the most relaxing thing.Before I go any further I have to make it clear that I may be biased in my review of this concert film as Led Zeppelin is my favourite band. Even so and trying to be as objective as possible they put on one hell of a show. The film is shot in a fairly conventional manner with closeups of faces instruments and the like spliced with wide shots and some nice super 8 style camera work which is reminiscent of the likes of The Song Remains the Same and the Led Zeppelin DVD. The old looking footage gives a 70s vibe which obviously matches the music. For the most part the camerawork is crisp and looks great in HD. There are plenty of interesting angles and cuts too which add to the visual enjoyment. Unlike Scorsese's Rolling Stones film Shine a Light which seemed to spend as much time on the audience as the band Celebration Day focuses almost solely on the on stage action with just a couple of cut aways to the audience.Musically the band sound incredibly tight. The three surviving members last performed together in 1988 and this was their first full length concert since John Bonham's death. Age and time coupled with a falling out between bassist John Paul Jones and singer Robert Plant and guitarist Jimmy Page appears to have had little effect as the band sound great. Robert Plant's voice is almost indistinguishable from his 1970s self save for a few missed high notes. Jimmy Page is still one of the greatest guitarists of all time and played the concert despite breaking his little finger just a month before the show. John Paul Jones always the quietest member of the group and the one who seems least at ease on stage played incredibly well on both bass and keyboards. Drummer Jason Bonham son of John was excellent and has all the ferocity of his father. He slotted straight in despite this being the first gig he'd played with the full band. Not a bad debut gig! It was nice to witness the genuine looks of pride and glee on the faces of the original members as the looked a Bonham Jnr playing his father's parts.In their eleven year existence Led Zeppelin created some of the most iconic rock music in history with the likes of Whole Lotta Love Kashmir Rock and Roll and Dazed and Confused amongst the most popular and enduring songs in rock history. Stairway to Heaven of course transcends even those songs and is frequently voted the most popular song of all time rock or otherwise. As well as the stalwarts like Kashmir and Stairway the band also perform some of my personal favourites such as No Quarter Misty Mountain Hop and Trampled Underfoot a song that always reminds me of my dad. For Your Life is also performed on stage for the first time ever but unfortunately there is no space for more of my favourites such as Communication Breakdown When the Levee Breaks Heartbreaker The Immigrant Song Gallows Pole or Ramble On. The problem with having such an extensive back catalogue is that there will always be songs that are missed but there could be few arguments that the chosen set was anything but spectacular.Overall Celebration Day is the sort of thing which is probably more enjoyable at home where you can sit back enjoy a drink or a smoke and properly rock out to the music. Even so I really enjoyed seeing my favourite band on the big screen and would recommend the forthcoming DVD to hard line fans as well as anyone who just thinks that Zeppelin are some old band what sang that long song. There's enough to satisfy fans and newcomers alike.www.attheback.blogspot.com".

Throughout the film I sat with my hands together as if in prayer my body occasionally moving in time.The sound mix is near perfect I wouldn't change a thing although there was one song I would revisit where the guitar was noticeably lowered to accommodate Robert this could be more subtle. I'd have to see it again to be sure though Actually the mix is perfect. It is brilliantly thought through with incredible attention paid to the emotional value of Led Zeppelin.

The band themselves do not stray from a very tight pattern on stage but that keeps you close to the music and the performances  yes they have aged but they still keep it together perfectly. Director Dick Carruthers lets the music do the talking and while the editing is tight the camera concentrates on the band rarely focusing on the audience. Absolutely fantastic. If you've missed them on the big screen then seek this out on Bluray and DVD in November  you will not be disappointed if you love Zep. The best concert film in a long time.".

And probably all the things that I wanted to see were up close and personal. This includes closeups of Jimmy Page playing his classic sunburst Les Paul at just the right times John Paul Jones' fretless bass and Page's skillful slide guitar playing during In My Time of Dying Jones' use of the rare 12string bass during Trampled Under Foot and Page's use of the Transperformance guitar during Whole Lotta Love. Awesome percussion by Jason Bonham throughout and Robert Plant's vocals hold up well. And those were just the technicalmusical closeups of real value. Add in the human emotion of Jones Page and drummer Jason Bonham looking at each other nodding and smiling when they were locked in to a tight groove. Not a dull moment completely engrossing all the way through.This is definitely a film that is a must see.".

As of me writing this it hasn't happened but we can always hope. If this concert does turn out to be the final Led Zeppelin show then it's certainly a good one and thankfully it has perfectly been preserved in this concert film. There's no question that all three original members and Jason Bonham are at the top of their game as they bring these classic songs to a new generation of fans. While there are certain changes from the last time the group was together there's still no question that this here is a major achievement with all sorts of classic tunes. I think the highlight of the night would have to be the amazing version of Stairway to Heaven which perfectly captures the mood and spirit of the studio version. Kashmir is another masterpiece as is Rock and Roll Black Dog and Whole Lotta Love. In fact there's really not a weak moment to be found among the setlist as the tunes selected are all fan favorites and the band does a very good job here. I was surprised at how well the band was but it's clear that they were doing a lot of rehearsing in the six weeks prior to this show. Page's guitar playing is as good as ever and Plant's voice holds up extremely well. One just wishes that all the work and effort that went into this gave way to more shows but CELEBRATION DAY is certainly a nice little gem that fans should love.".

When they broke up and he ended up in LZ I was disappointed. I never really liked Page's electric guitar work though his riffs and acoustic playing were exemplary. JPJ was almost invisible in the Zep albums  the production could have been so much better. He is a wonderful musician. The Celebration Day concert was great though although Page's lead guitar work grated rather he should stick to chords. I think it showed why the band was so successful and managed not to be a pale shadow of what they once were. Jason Bonham was every bit as good as his dad was  I first saw him play when he was about 7 or 8!! Nothing was lost from the drumming. The guys can be proud of themselves  thanks Robert for not agreeing to reform  a sensible and cool decision.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is more of a technical review on each musician rather than of the concert as whole as there are enough of those already.Robert Plant Well he did a remarkable job considering it was almost 40 years ago that he recorded the most well know Led Zeppelin tracks. His voice with its age can't hit the high notes anymore and he changed the articulation in several songs as he may just not have the muscle memory of what they used to sound like.Jimmy Page Not sure if it was his finger or just age but he was struggling to keep up to tempo on several songs. His fingers were not as nimble along the fret board as they used to and thus there was not the resonance from the guitar parts that is in example on other live Led Zeppelin titles like Song remains the same or How the west was won.John Paul Jones By far the standout from this performance. The tone and sound he gets from the bass guitar is amazing for a guy over 60. Maybe the road fitness he would have built up touring with Them Crocked Vultures a few years back is part of it but from the first song till last when he has a bass in his hands he fills out the whole bottom end of the sound beautifully. Sadly I found his keyboard a little rushed maybe. No quarter which should have been a highlight for me kind of just came and went for me.Jason Bonham Well he had massive shoes to fill and sadly it was his feet that let him down. I have no idea why he chose to use a double bass peddle but it was the wrong way to go. Fair enough he may not have the jack rabbit right foot that his dad was famed for having but to just create a basic muddy sound where Led Zeppelin was known for having distinction was a massive disappointment. From the opening of Good times Bad times he was on song with everything above the waste but as a drummer he missed the bass drum parts by a long mark. I also found the choice of Zildjian cymbals a little surprising as they have no where near the cut through and volume that the old Paiste giant beats that his dad used had. I know he is sponsored by Zildjian but seriously this was Led Zeppelin.The overall sound mix I also found a little guitar heavy but then the same problem happened when Song remains the same was remastered for DVD release. I think Jimmy Page kind of went make me louder POverall an awesome show and I can't wait for the blue ray so I can listen properly without the echo that a cinema brings.".

One nitpick  I didn't like the way the director sometimes fast froze the camera for short spurts ditto for the color filtering. I'm guessing that the aim was to emulate a concert snap shot but that just looked fuzzy to me. It isn't done often enough to be annoying though. Other than that the camera work is pretty solid.

	schema:reviewBody "Not a masterpiece but definitely a show worth seeing Word is that zeppelin never formally rehearsed for it and occasionally it shows. They are not as tight as they could be and some of Pages guitar work is a bit muddled because the levels have not been perfectly balanced but still most of the hits land. Trampled underfoot and Kashmir would have to be the shows highlights while stairway to heaven sounds a bit too grungy and Page kind of mails in the solo.Jason Bonham to his credit summons the muster of his father and sometimes even more.

They are not as tight as they could be and some of Pages guitar work is a bit muddled because the levels have not been perfectly balanced but still most of the hits land. Trampled underfoot and Kashmir would have to be the shows highlights while stairway to heaven sounds a bit too grungy and Page kind of mails in the solo.Jason Bonham to his credit summons the muster of his father and sometimes even more.

Jimmy Page Robert Plant John Paul Jones and Jason Bonham play just about every song you'd expect to hear unless you were counting on a selection from Zep's final studio album In Through the Out Door from 'Stairway to Heaven' to 'Whole Lotta Love' and even manage a deft firsttime live rendition of 'For Your Life'. There are a few shaky moments but to the band's credit these were not corrected with overdubs for the majority of the twohour show everybody's in top form. By the time they launch into 'Kashmir' Led Zeppelin are firing on all cylinders and the grandeur of their performance is such that the 27 years which had elapsed between the group's last fulllength concert and this one simply evaporate. It's a stunning moment to witness even for those of us who weren't there in person. My only beef with Celebration Day is that the bass guitar is often buried in the mix John Paul Jones's doomy intro on 'Dazed and Confused' sounds like it's coming from miles away. Jones and the song deserve better.".

The greatest hard rock band in history has nothing to prove. Celebration Day seems to me to be just that a celebration. The remaining members plus Jason Bonham are there to pay tribute to Atlantic Records founder Ahmet Ertegun and they do it as only they can. This is an older more mature Led Zeppelin.

Set list Good Times Bad Times Ramble On Black Dog In My Time of Dying For Your Life Trampled Under Foot Nobody's Fault But Mine No Quarter Since I've Been Loving You Dazed and Confused Stairway to Heaven The Song Remains the Same Misty Mountain Hop Kashmir Whole Lotta Love Rock and Roll.Great concert and capture of it. Good choice of songs. Nothing major gets left out OK maybe Immigrant Song but I could understand if Robert Plant didn't feel he could manage the vocals on that any more. While Led Zep might not have the energy and swagger of the 70s when they were the undisputed kings of concerts and rock music generally their musicianship and artistry is undiminished. The power is still there too. If anything the music sounds tighter and fuller than in the 70s. Some of this is due to advances in live recording techniques and technology. Some of it could be due to guitarist Jimmy Page now not being under the influence of drugs...If you compare this to The Song Remains the Same the film of Led Zep's 1974 Madison Square Garden concerts I probably prefer the music in The Song Remains the Same we won't go into the nonmusic side of TSRTS  some of that was incredibly cheesy and certainly diminished the quality of the film. There's a rawness about it and there's the Led Zep mystique too. Celebration Day isn't too far behind though.".

Even though Plant Page  Jones were obviously wellrehearsed for this concert and Plant even got a new perm just for the occasion I couldn't help but notice that between all of the robotic rockstar gestures and posturing there was a decidedly bored look on all of their 3 faces.This in turn made it quite difficult for me to watch these dudes with any real enjoyment while they rather listlessly strut around on stage like peacocks at only half mast.Anyways  I'd say that this DVD titled Celebration Day was at least worth a view. But personally speaking I'm one who prefers to remember Led Zeppelin as they were in the days of their youth rather than as I saw them now as stiff old men trying desperately? to retain an image of who they were 30 years ago that has long ago faded away into the past.".

With such flamboyant settings people and actions casting is absolutely critical. This is where Kevin Bacon and Colin Firth are invaluable and perfect. They are so famous so flamboyant on their own and so well known that we are drawn into this story right along with Karen. And let's face it they are all sexuality with evil and lies boiling just beneath the surface. This is that rare kind of film that does justice to a phrase like that which is usually written on the cover but not delivered in the movie.These men carry their own persona into the film and deliver just the right amount of insanity and insecurity. Watch Bacon's Lanny yell at a waiter for bringing lobster to the Jewish Lanny. Watch Firth's Vince stumble away from Lanny and Maureen reeling with rejection and sexual confusion. Watch Lanny lean over and kiss Vince's cheek while they perform high. The movie could have been all style and intrigue and little substance but since Egoyan is directing the sexual scenes are handled deeply the drugs are films in full glory and poignancy creeps in through cracks of the story.Alison Lohman who was SO good in the vastly underrated Matchstick Men has a good part here as a young journalist still somewhat infatuated with Lanny and Vince's famous duo. For me her performance is the only one that never really takes off and leaves the screen but I still went along with her character Karen and it is not a serious or terribly noticeable flaw simply a slight mismatching of actress to character all though perhaps I find Karen a bit weaker and smarter than the other characters and no actress could have changed that.Some quotes are a bit bookish and take us out of the movie for a moment but even them I found working excellently. Bacon's voiceover in particular drips with confident malevolence. He has a speech on what he sees in Maureen's eyes in a key moment that at first seems ridiculous and distant but had me coming back and appreciating it more and more.Overall if you like the looks of the filmstorytraileror even cover it certainly delivers and you will love it. The combination of drugs mystery lies murder fame bisexuality more drugs more sex and above all Egoyan's flashy but confident directing is stunning.Not perfect but a wild ride about manipulation consequences fame and sex.".

Going in I just didn't see Bacon in such a roll. But it didn't take long before Egoyan's primary cast selection including Kevin Bacon Colin Firth and Alison Lohman was clearly calculated and well thought.Some might call this Egoyan's 'most mainstream' work to date but it retains many of the qualities we've come to expect from him. The screenplay was precisely developed to provide a great pace to the story and to provide little 'bits and pieces' of key information just when you need them. It doesn't give the truth away too early yet when the secret is finally revealed it's accompanied by a sense of I should have seen that coming.This film does deal with some 'touchy' cinematic subjects including sex and drug use. What should be truly disturbing is the murder in question but 'simple' murder is accepted in film without a second thought.The screening I saw was the 'uncut' version of the film. There has apparently been some controversy surrounding some of the films content so I don't know whether this is the version the moviegoing public will eventually see in massmarket theatres. It contained some pretty graphic sex but it wasn't gratuitous  it served a purpose in the development of the characters and story. These scenes while clearly not suitable for a younger audience belong in this film.An excellent film as most have come to expect from Egoyan.".

It is a story set in the 1950's and 1970's and the relationships involve some adult behavior. Remember the 70's when there were a lot of drugs and a lot of sex? Sure not everyone lived the party life but some did and that is all Where the Truth Lies shows. Intimacy is part of the story character development and not put in just to show some skin. Plus Atom directed the film so well that you are never drawn to the nudity you are drawn to the characters. Bravo to Firth and Bacon for genuine performances and not shying away from a good story. Lesser actors could not have pulled it off. It is an honest beautifully shot film. Sometimes it felt long but maybe I was just tired. Nothing in this film is offensive unless you are a very immature adult. Worth the  to see this movie.".

There is no real focus while the story swerves from the fifties to the seventies and from Los Angeles to New York to Miami. It's a historical portrait about Hollywood in the fifties but also a psychological drama and a whodunit at the same time. This movie could have been great if it restricted itself to one of those genres. I kept wondering what Egoyan wanted to tell us  except who killed Maureen O'Flaherty. Maybe he wanted to tell us only that but in that case the movie could have been a lot less complex. What annoyed me most was the completely improbable plot. A corpse in a lobster crate mixedup identities secret letters from unknown senders blackmail threats  that's so Agatha Christie!

I almost believed some newspaper critics' reviews and was prepared to be at least a little bit disappointed either with the actors critics said were miscast the sex scenes critics said were explicit or the ending. I was sitting there and waiting for a disappointment but it never came. It is a superb murder mystery with at least 3 top notch twists and in the end I was completely satisfied.In my opinion and I know a thing or two about this the love scene between Alice and Alison is one of the most beautiful ones ever performed on the screen. I mean the tastefully made oral sex scene. Alice stops for a moment looks up at Alison with a trace of a smile ... the moonlight illuminates Alice's slightly wet mouth and chin... she looks down and continues. I haven't seen in any other film a more gorgeous pose than that of Alison during this exercise. Americans can make love as beautifully as Europeans and this film is the only proof so far. It even surpasses the straight love scene with Luisa Ranieri in Antonioni's Eros. The film is not about sex though it is wonderfully choreographed. The most impressive thing here is certainly the story.P.S. Critics really did a disservice to us. Some of these same guys I remember used unbelievable superlatives while reviewing poor horror movies.

I have never been moved to write a previewreview but in this case it becomes necessary. To say that the movie is impressive would be an unfortunate meiosis. Everything we have come to expect from Egoyan in the past two decades is present in fine form impeccable miseenscene exquisitely precise camera movement and a score that not only adds texture but is an artistic accomplishment in and of itself.But wait there's more. It turns out that Egoyan's first foray into a larger more industry piece brings out the best in his sensibilities and shows that he is a genuine and lasting artist that is capable of evolving while remaining true to the vision that made him an international phenomenon for the acclaimed Exotica and The Sweet Hereafter.Simply put the cast is outstanding. The performances Egoyan brings forth are nuanced...one of a kind. In particular Alison Lohman as Karen O'Conner nails the difficulties of multivalence like a seasoned vet. She is at once timid cunning she surrenders as well as she controls both Alice and Svengali. I get a very strong Jennifer Jason Leigh 2.0 vibe from her. Jane Greer all the way. She has mad potential and it is exciting to see early on.Kevin Bacon's extraordinary gifts of performance reach their zenith in the impossibly charismatic Lanny Morris. His is a tourdeforce performance that rivals Pacino in Dog Day Afternoon Mitchum in Out of The Past and Brando in Last Tango. That's my word! He will certainly be nominated for an Academy Award and unless another actor comes forward with a role of a lifetime it would be no surprise if he cops the statue especially considering his recent work in Mystic River for which he was overlooked.Colin Firth is a star in his own right shining brilliantly as Lanny's road dog Vince Collins perhaps the film's most intriguing complex character study. Firth gives all of himself and more and is as courageous as it comes. David Hayman also is creepily adept inna Erich von Stroheim style.Los Angeles is captured magnificently as is the world of old school song and dance star power. Think Martin and Lewis even more buck wild than they really were and you'll get a sense of the flavor.Structurally the narrative is Trump Tight revealing yet never telling fulfilling its film noir genre and then making a logical progression upon it. Yes people it's all here...Lies Laughs Loves Songs Tears Selfishness Generosity Deceit Reconciliation and HOT HOT SEX. Check it! Depending of course upon how it is promoted this film has the opportunity to do great things for North American Cinema. It can bridge the gap between big box office productions and socalled art house films entertaining while simultaneously exploring more profound issues. Popular audiences are not stupid they just need to learn how to see and think and feel again. This is the ambassadorial movie we have been waiting for. I believe that Where The Truth Lies can produce a kind of leap of faith in moviegoers and producers alike so that there can perhaps be another Golden Era of Hollywood while the millennium is still young.Where The Truth Lies get 5 Mics from The Source and a Robert Townsend soul clap! Congrats Maestro Egoyan. I'll have the lobster.Jonathan Peter Jackson Budapest Hungary June 25".

The film gets straight to the point right from the start as we are introduced to a Jerry Lewis Dean Martin type entertainment duo a haunting image of a corpse in a bathtub and a determined young lady wanting to write about her idols. The slick editing allows the film to maintain its steady track. Egoyan finely contrasts the 50s and 70s. The wonderful mise en scene flashy lighting and score bring out a 50's feel. While the score brings out a lot of mysteriousness of the 70s the sex and drugs phase. The camerawork deserves mention. Most of the scenes of the 50's scenes were effectively done with long shots while a lot of the 70's scenes were shot with quick snaps.Then there's the unusual cast that includes Kevin Bacon Alison Lohman and Colin Firth. Bacon gives an energetic performance as the younger Lanny Morris of the 50s and he brings a 'lost' maturity as the 70's Morris. While a majority have stated Lohman as being miscast I found her to have the right combination of naivety sex appeal and vulnerability as Karen. The actress certainly holds her own in the presence of the more accomplished actors and bravely carries the film. Firth is remarkable and he completely sheds his Darcy image and gives a more restrained and sometimes explosive where required performance as Vince Collins. Rachel Blanchard demonstrates the right kind of deceitful innocence and enigma.Some have stated the sex scenes to be of a 'cold' nature. However I didn't see it that way. Sexuality is an integral part of the film and it is hinted that each character sees it differently. Bacon's Morris pays a lot of attention to his sexual partner's eyes and aftersex behaviour. I can't reveal much about the other characters without spilling out spoilers but their views differ. There's the frighteningly erotic love scene between Alice and Karen followed by a distraught look on Lohman's face. The last sexscene was particularly disturbing as this is the scene that brings out their alternative side.However the revelation in the end was a bit of a letdown. Not because of the twist which is clever enough but the motivation behind it would have worked better had more background information been provided. Where The Truth Lies' mainly works because of Egoyan's unique presentation and storytelling the visual flair the performances the score and the stunning combination of all the themes ie sex drugs sexuality murder fame sounds a bit clichd but it is shown differently.".

	schema:reviewBody "Egoyan's weakest film at least since he came to prominence with Exotica. It's actually a somewhat interesting mystery but it has a lot of flaws. There is a death possibly a murder in the hotel suite of two famous comedians played by Colin Firth and Kevin Bacon based on Martin and Lewis. That's the film's biggest flaw that this completely fictional mystery uses Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis as a model. It's very distracting. The bulk of the story has a young journalist Alison Lohman writing the story of the two comedians trying to solve the mystery. The filmmaking is pretty good but Egoyan except for The Sweet Hereafter has always been a weak director when it comes to actors. Lohman who was great in Ridley Scott's Matchstick Men is awful here she does get naked and have sex with a woman though which makes the film almost worth seeing. Kevin Bacon who gave his best performance ever last year in the still underseen The Woodsman isn't especially good either. Only Firth does a good job. The film is also overscored with some very clich mystery music. Mychael Danna's scores for Exotica and The Sweet Hereafter were brilliant this one's a flop.".

	onyx:emotionText "Egoyan's weakest film at least since he came to prominence with Exotica. It's actually a somewhat interesting mystery but it has a lot of flaws. There is a death possibly a murder in the hotel suite of two famous comedians played by Colin Firth and Kevin Bacon based on Martin and Lewis. That's the film's biggest flaw that this completely fictional mystery uses Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis as a model. It's very distracting. The bulk of the story has a young journalist Alison Lohman writing the story of the two comedians trying to solve the mystery. The filmmaking is pretty good but Egoyan except for The Sweet Hereafter has always been a weak director when it comes to actors. Lohman who was great in Ridley Scott's Matchstick Men is awful here she does get naked and have sex with a woman though which makes the film almost worth seeing. Kevin Bacon who gave his best performance ever last year in the still underseen The Woodsman isn't especially good either. Only Firth does a good job. The film is also overscored with some very clich mystery music. Mychael Danna's scores for Exotica and The Sweet Hereafter were brilliant this one's a flop.";

It doesn't have an ounce of subtlety to it  it bludgeons the viewer over the head with any plot point that is even remotely important by repeating it at least twice  and what little plot it has is overwhelmed by its awfulness. The dialogue is terrible with a few exceptions and Alison Lohman's acting leaves much to be desired. Kevin Bacon and Colin Firth do the best they can with what they have and Firth actually has one or two very good moments but on the whole this movie is best left alone. I would only recommend it as a novelty because it takes a special effort for a film to be this spectacularly bad.".

	schema:headline " HELP! Hollywood's in desperate need of good writers!";
	schema:reviewBody "One of the most pleasant surprises in movie watching is to see a film you've heard nothing about and discover what a marvelous gem it is. I had that experience with The Sweet Hereafter an exceptionally well made movie that was wonderful in many aspects spoton acting artistically beautiful cinematography flawless directing and a practically perfect screenplay adapted from an outstanding important book written by a top shelf author. I liked The Sweet Hereafter so much that I've put on my eventuallymustwatchlist any other work from the actors that were in it as well as the director Atom Egoyan. Sadly so far no other work by any of them is even in the same ballpark. That's usually quite common when you discover a cinematic masterpiece very few directors actors et al are ever involved in a great film and if they are it's often just the one and they spend the rest of their careers trying to find another one to match but to no avail. I thought Ararat was good but no where near up to par with The Sweet Hereafter. Okay so the material's not quite the same quality let's see what else Mr. Egoyan has done surely a man who can direct a great powerful film will eventually put out something that I will find a great cinematic experience. Coppola followed The Godfather with the best sequel of all time The Godfather 2 and the mind blowing Apocalypse Now. Atom Egoyan's got to make something else that's exceptional right? Which leads to one of the more unpleasant experiences in movie watching after discovering a great film you're never able to find anything remotely of the same merit from the directors actors etc. involved. Sometimes it's even a terribly foul piece presented for your cinematic palate such as Where the Truth Lies. Do you ever watch a movie and it starts to deteriorate until you end up angry for having wasted your time? Or worse walked in with high expectations only to be slapped in the face with idiotic drivel? This is one of those films. No matter how great a chef is he can't make great cuisine from dog sht. It won't even be edible.Who wrote this contrived unrealistic crap? It didn't start off bad there was even an element that was interesting where the telethon was just a phony scam for the mob to cash in. But it was right about then that the movie rapidly descended into a very stupidly unrealistic place. What is necessary for really good writing is for the writer to do material heshe knows. What is usually an element of really bad writing is when it so obviously is a thinly contrived piece that is about a subject matter the author knows nothing about but naively thinks they can make it up as they go along and it won't be obviously obtuse. And it doesn't even have to the situation or subject matter itself that the writer needs to be an expert on but rather on character how people act in a specific situation. When your credibility allowance gets strained as you see a character behave in a way you know is childishly unrealistic it's bad enough but when the other supposedly savvy worldly characters are attracted to her infantile behavior you know you're watching a real turd transforming.And this female lead Alison Lohman is just plain awful. If this is the extent of her acting ability she'd be wise to save every cent of every paycheck because she'll need it all when her fleeting youth and beauty fade. I know Hollywood and its satellites prefer to use pretty young girls as much as possible even in place of women but why does it insist on putting them in places where they would have no business in the real world? At least not behaving the way they do in awful films like this one preening narcissists who haven't the vaguest clue about anything other than their self centered demands. Sure the world likes to look at pretty young womengirls but usually only sexually insecure boys of various ages will consistently tolerate their infantile emotional demands. That is up until they can finally get a taste of their guarded fruits and most will then realize it's hardly worth the price to continue to be the emotional whipping boy of a nasty narcissist.There are enough really bad and mediocre films the vast majority actually out there that I usually try and forget them as quickly as possible without wasting any time with a comment. The only reason I chose to mention this soon to be forgotten piece is that Mr. Egoyan is capable of vastly much much better work. I know it's in him I've seen the results when he excels. He just needs to be patient and use some decently written material. Maybe Russel Banks could offer up one of his fine novels that has yet to be tapped for film. They did a great nay fantastic adaptation before together. If not anyone know any way to sneak a decent piece of writing into Hollywood? I hear they have The Bad Writing Patrolmen who usually only allow the worst crap to get through. If you wonder about this just chose just about any film at random to prove my point.".

In my views this movie could not have been any worse since at the end of the day it leaves the viewers with the impression not only of having wasted both their time and money but also of having been crooked.The truth actually lies beneath Some might interpret this as lack of subtlety or nuance but after having thought of this for a couple of hours I could only come up with the conclusion that this movie is extremely poor in nearly every single way the script is rather poor the editing is artificial misleading and annoying the acting is extremely poor at least as far as Alison Lohman is concerned the music is banal the costumes and the make up are off.Indeed the script is in fact frustratingly simple and should have been the object of a short a young journalist investigates a crime and unveils the criminal after a couple of interviews. Furthermore the ending which reveals why the crime took place leads to only one conclusion much ado about nothing.Secondly Egoyan has obviously tried to hide the shallowness of the script by overediting. Indeed there are numerous flashbacks that obviously aim at making the plot more dense than it really is. In fact they only make the story more difficult to understand without making it more appealing.The truth is that the ending does not surprise anyone not only because it is not original but above all because most viewers have lost interest after 40 minutes.Indeed they are introduced to a young journalist Alison Lohman who is they are told a young and unexperienced journalist who is given the task of drafting a one million dollars biography of a TV star. Besides the incongruity of such a situation why an unexperienced journalist? why so much money for a TV star ? etc. the extremely poor acting of Alison Lohman makes it difficult for the audience to feel any sympathy when surprised she frowns when upset she frowns when aroused disappointed sympathizing sad or happy she frowns again  and again. Her obvious lack of talent is also exemplified by her off voice that is used all along the movie to explain to the lost audience what Egoyan is aiming at. She tries so hard to sound mysterious that it becomes laughable especially since the suspense never catches the audience.She also looks very sexy during the entire movie for an unexplainable reason whether at night or noon whether in the presence of a man or a woman she is constantly wearing lowcleavage dresses or robes that are absolutely inappropriate with the situation and which make it even harder to believe. She also insists in typing her article with two incheslong nails which are as everybody knows the distinctive sign of a journalist.Furthermore during the entire movie a very loud music apparently composed exclusively for violins attempts to increase the nonexisting suspense. In fact it is just plainly annoying.Overall the entire movie is extremely tacky and the only reason for watching it would be the anatomy of Alison Lohman.

Lohman is way over her head for such a hmm complex role if complex is the right word to describe anything in this film. The shoes were too big for both actors to fill. But as miscast as Lohman was her performance is so peculiar that it's almost works on a certain level of pastiche.See Colin Firth give the only sensible performance in the whole film.See bad acting from every secondary character including embarrassing turns from Maury Chaykin as a mobster and David Hayman as Reuben a latently gay analretentive overprotective psycho valet.See a dozen truly unpleasant characters populating the confusing landscape including Maureen who ends up dead and basically no one really cares about.See an overdirected mess of story well there's really no story here but without the multiple timelines voiceovers narrative structures or other deliberately confusing techniques people would have figured this out reasonably fast. See a very long scene when Bonnie Sonja Bennett reads Lanny's manuscript from L.A. to her friend Karen Lohman who's in NY expensive long distance charges! then the film visually shows us what she's reading AND we hear Lanny Bacon's voice reading what he wrote. Got that?See uninspired cinematography of fake looking vintage production values of different decades with the 1950s filmed through a misty lens while the current timeline 1970s is shot clearly. Brilliant!See loads of naked chicks who remarkably all look the same and even more remarkably the nudity seems misplaced. The fake orgy scene for example.

See a drugged up Alison Lohman have sex with an equally stoned Kristin Adams who is still dressed up as Alice in Wonderland. See Alice in Wonderland give cunnilingus to Karen the Nancy Drew wannabe her face dripping wet as she moves away from between Karen's legs while Colin Firth watches on.Hear voiceovers that are supposed to be evocative but are so wordy everpresent and clunky that they end up sinking the whole film. Voiceovers such as If I can will my Polio away I'd certainly be able to will away the effect of any drug! this being my favoriteThat moment it changed my life. I was about to find my way into Lenny's book after he had found such a powerful way into mine phew!The. Floor. Plan. Was. Still. The. Same! thanks for telling meWe were GODS!

Does anyone talk like that?This is my daughter. This is what I have of her the old woman says of the tree she's standing in front of.See lobsters lobsters lobsters! Lobsters play a very important part of the story. Don't laugh...OK go ahead and laugh.See shots of Kevin Bacon undressing Alison Lohman intercut with shots of lobsters.See homophobia as the soontobedead Maureen blackmails Lanny and Vince after she witnessed Vince trying to penetrate Lanny during a threesome they had with her.See totally confused direction as we're made to feel sorry for Maureen that damn tree! even if her actions as a blackmailer started the whole thing. See even more homophobia as latently gay analretentive overprotective psycho valet Reuben a totally unimportant character is revealed to be the one who killed Maureen the wannabe blackmailer no one really cared about.All of this set to swirling knowingly kitschy overdone soundtrack.See the fires of puberty! OK maybe not but please see this film. It's a deliriously bad film not since the likes of SHOWGIRLS!".

I was about to find my way into Lenny's book after he had found such a powerful way into mine phew!The. Floor. Plan. Was. Still. The. Same! thanks for telling meWe were GODS! Hear dialogue not even Laurence Olivier could save The realization of your life story should not be threatened because of my failings! Alison says to Colin who happens to keep a straight face. Does anyone talk like that?This is my daughter. This is what I have of her the old woman says of the tree she's standing in front of.See lobsters lobsters lobsters! Lobsters play a very important part of the story. Don't laugh...OK go ahead and laugh.See shots of Kevin Bacon undressing Alison Lohman intercut with shots of lobsters.See homophobia as the soontobedead Maureen blackmails Lanny and Vince after she witnessed Vince trying to penetrate Lanny during a threesome they had with her.See totally confused direction as we're made to feel sorry for Maureen that damn tree! even if her actions as a blackmailer started the whole thing. See even more homophobia as latently gay analretentive overprotective psycho valet Reuben a totally unimportant character is revealed to be the one who killed Maureen the wannabe blackmailer no one really cared about.All of this set to swirling knowingly kitschy overdone soundtrack.See the fires of puberty! OK maybe not but please see this film. It's a deliriously bad film not since the likes of SHOWGIRLS!";

I figured there was no way for it to be bad with Bacon and Firth's involvement. I was wrong.Unfortunately this flick fell very flat. The sexual scenes were awkward and cold not a spark of passion in any of them. Really a pity too as Kevin and Colin both have demonstrated a talent for conveying pure sensuality in other roles. The intrigue was predictable and too drawn out. There was very little true noir. In point of fact the tweaked diffused bright white flashback scenes were distracting from the narrative. The acting wasn't horrible but it wasn't Oscar worthy either. The musical score was like a bad clich contrived and unoriginal.Overall I feel this movie is extremely pretentious and held in too high regard. Ultimately I found none of the characters likable nor even sympathetic and that might be the greatest fault. If you don't really care whodunit then how is a whodunit supposed to resonate? You know the one thing I did like? The costumes. Costuming did a superb job in both decades of clothing. It's perhaps the only thing this film really nailed. I don't exactly want my money back but I don't think it's worth a second viewing either.".

Most people despise seeing this having judged by the trailer that this movie is strictly about sex and so did I at one point. What convinced me to see this is the enormous talent displayed by the 3 leads and director Atom Egoyan. Alison Lohman Matchstick Men plays Karen O'Connor an ambitious young journalist and big fan of Lanny Morris and Vince Collins. Alison Lohman's performance is a tourdeforce combining elements of naiveness ambition and sexuality wrapped inside an enigma. She's smart and wants to do the right thing even though it's working against two people who she truly adores. Kevin Bacon The Woodsman gives a very strong performance as Lanny Morris 12 of a comedy duo and insecure person off cameras and shows. Colin Firth Love Actuallyplays Vince Collins the refined smooth other 12 of a comedy duo. He combines elements of hysteria and refinement in one person.With all that being said the movie itself is a good movie yet its very strange and intensely fascinating. Its also a highly stylized film and it felt like all 3 stars aren't giving good performances  even though they are . I figured it was a part of the style and feel of the film  which is 1940's film noir not pornography .The controversial scene  menageatrois  is not as graphic as most people thought it would be yet I was first shocked that this movie had originally been given an NC17 rating. Yes the sex scenes still surpass R rating boundaries but I've seen R rated movies with sex scenes that are just as intense.Also featured in this film is a very clever yet poignant ending that kept me guessing. 810.".

	schema:headline " A mighty swing and a miss..but worth seeing";
	schema:reviewBody "Good film glad to have seen it. Wish there were more adult films as I'm tired of sifting through what appeals to 14 year old males. I wasn't shocked by the sex scenes and can think of a few Rrated films that contained scenes which made me more uncomfortable. There is a lot of sex in the film it's not framed in shouldersup shots but it's not walltowall. There is a good story that goes along with it. I wouldn't call it erotic this is a story about sex as a way to manipulate people and sex because you can. It is graphically honest. I didn't feel it overwhelmed the plot or took you out of the story. If you're looking for a souped up version of Body Heat though you'll probably be disappointed.So I start with a 10 for interesting story and great performances from Firth and Bacon. Bacon clearly has the showier role and the script mostly revolves around Lanny and how people relate to him. He commits himself to it totally and gives you a revealing performance of this out there character warts and all. You see Lanny for what he is both the public and private persona. It is a pitch perfect performance. Colin Firth handles the more complex character of Vince with his usual ability to reveal everything and nothing at the same time. His character is more veiled and enigmatic not so clearly scripted which works in the movie and leaves you with questions as much as answers by the film's end. He delivers it with truthfulness and without gimmickry or sleight of hand. One of the thing's I've always liked about him as an actor is once you've seen a movie and know the ending you can rewatch it and see an even more layered performance than you first realized because his character was fully there from scene one. The mystery though not what I'd call suspenseful did serve as a useful and involving vehicle in an interesting character drama. Then I start to subtract. The film started off a little slow and it took me a while to establish an interest in what really happened to the dead girl beyond what I'd picked up from the trailer. And Alison Lohman was just bad I couldn't buy into her character at all. She was supposed to be the engine that drives to the solution of the murder and why these guys broke up pushing them to reveal secrets they've held onto for 15 years. Not only did she need to be tougher and much smarter and more driven her acting was way off the mark. Her lines in a scene might read I'm a tough cookie but there was nothing in her performance that supported it before after or during the scene. She was supposed to be someone who you'd pay a million dollars to for a hardhitting expose because you believed she could get at the truth. Instead she comes across as the girl from Kansas who just fell off the turnip truck looking for a big break. She's out of her depth exacerbated by being blown off the screen by her costars. I never believed she could stand up to Vince the way she has to in order to make the plot evolve or hold Lanny's interest as a sexual liaison or an adversary. She added nothing and I think reduced the impact of the mystery's resolution.Though I agree with an earlier review that Rachel Blanchard was a surprise as the girl killed in the hotel room. She was good.My last nit..the music was often wrong. I'm not usually so aware of the music in a film but in this one it was distracting at times way over the top.So this is a film that coulda been a contender along the lines of LA Confidential. Close but no cigar. If this were meant to be a break out film of sorts for Egoyan I don't think he completely managed it. I do think it is worth the price of admission though and is better than most of the films I've seen this year. I don't mean to undersell the film and its strengths make up for the weaknesses. So if character dramas are your thing see it for an interesting dynamic and two standout performances in an involving plot. See it with friends who love thought provoking movies probably not right as first date fare.".

I didn't feel it overwhelmed the plot or took you out of the story. If you're looking for a souped up version of Body Heat though you'll probably be disappointed.So I start with a 10 for interesting story and great performances from Firth and Bacon. Bacon clearly has the showier role and the script mostly revolves around Lanny and how people relate to him. He commits himself to it totally and gives you a revealing performance of this out there character warts and all. You see Lanny for what he is both the public and private persona. It is a pitch perfect performance. Colin Firth handles the more complex character of Vince with his usual ability to reveal everything and nothing at the same time. His character is more veiled and enigmatic not so clearly scripted which works in the movie and leaves you with questions as much as answers by the film's end. He delivers it with truthfulness and without gimmickry or sleight of hand. One of the thing's I've always liked about him as an actor is once you've seen a movie and know the ending you can rewatch it and see an even more layered performance than you first realized because his character was fully there from scene one. The mystery though not what I'd call suspenseful did serve as a useful and involving vehicle in an interesting character drama. Then I start to subtract. The film started off a little slow and it took me a while to establish an interest in what really happened to the dead girl beyond what I'd picked up from the trailer. And Alison Lohman was just bad I couldn't buy into her character at all. She was supposed to be the engine that drives to the solution of the murder and why these guys broke up pushing them to reveal secrets they've held onto for 15 years. Not only did she need to be tougher and much smarter and more driven her acting was way off the mark. Her lines in a scene might read I'm a tough cookie but there was nothing in her performance that supported it before after or during the scene. She was supposed to be someone who you'd pay a million dollars to for a hardhitting expose because you believed she could get at the truth. Instead she comes across as the girl from Kansas who just fell off the turnip truck looking for a big break. She's out of her depth exacerbated by being blown off the screen by her costars. I never believed she could stand up to Vince the way she has to in order to make the plot evolve or hold Lanny's interest as a sexual liaison or an adversary. She added nothing and I think reduced the impact of the mystery's resolution.Though I agree with an earlier review that Rachel Blanchard was a surprise as the girl killed in the hotel room. She was good.My last nit..the music was often wrong. I'm not usually so aware of the music in a film but in this one it was distracting at times way over the top.So this is a film that coulda been a contender along the lines of LA Confidential. Close but no cigar. If this were meant to be a break out film of sorts for Egoyan I don't think he completely managed it. I do think it is worth the price of admission though and is better than most of the films I've seen this year. I don't mean to undersell the film and its strengths make up for the weaknesses. So if character dramas are your thing see it for an interesting dynamic and two standout performances in an involving plot. See it with friends who love thought provoking movies probably not right as first date fare.";

	schema:headline " Interesting adaptation quite different from Grisham's novel";
	schema:reviewBody "This review is targeted at those who have read John Grisham's novel and might want to know how the movie compares to the book.The largest and most controversial difference between the two is that while the trial in the book was about holding tobacco companies responsible for cigarette advertising addiction and lung cancer the trial in the movie is a case of holding firearms companies responsible for encouraging guns to be sold to criminals. While the book centers around the law as all Grisham novels do the movie centers around gun control. Therefore the movie can be quite political. Those who do not appreciate political statements in movies beware.The movie spends a lot more time on Wendall Rohr and Rankin Fitch the plantiff's lawyer and the defendant's jury consultant. While Rohr is a flat character hardly mentioned in the book the movie characterizes him as a man who still possesses some sense of the ideal practice of law. Fitch pitiable and even slightly likable in the book is shown as an utterly malicious man in the movie. The members of the jury are definitely not shown much in the movie. We don't get to watch exactly how Nicholas Easter befriends each one individually and we are told less about each jury member. The psychology that is in the book is largely absent from the movie and replaced with a few scenes of dramatic flair.The casting of the movie was GREAT. When I heard there was a Runaway Jury movie I immediately imagined John Cusack as Nicholas Easter. Rachel Weisz Dustin Hoffman Gene Hackman and the actors who play members of the jury are almost as I pictured them as well! Because of this change in theme the movie is much darker than the book. Extreme violence and arson make their way into jury manipulation. Fitch becomes a much more malevolent character. The ways in which members of the jury are bumped or released from jury duty are much darker than in the book. Little details that were altered to adapt to gun control instead of tobacco are interesting and appropriate. The movie is a different but welldone adaptation. Even if you don't enjoy the movie it is interesting to compare it to the book.".

Whether it's classics modern stories or the collective works of particular authors films are forever being produced with adapted screenplays. One author who seems to be used a lot is intellectual writer John Grisham. Normally setting his stories in American courtrooms his stories are often complex and twist based with strong resolutions. 'Runaway Jury' is no exception and in 2003 the film was turned into a feature film starring Gene Hackman and John Cusack. Well acted by everyone involved it is an entertaining piece of work which leaves you thinking throughout before sticking on a conclusion you might well have predicted beforehand but which you still enjoy seeing it reach.In a landmark trial a woman is taking the gun companies to court for compensation after a major family loss. Leading the defence for the gun companies is the constantly victorious Rankin Finch Gene Hackman. A regular at fixing juries in his favour Finch finds himself facing a challenge this time when a couple one a jury member John Cusack and one working behind the scenes Rachel Weisz decide to make money out of the same skills Finch employs so successfully.Whether Hackman Cusack or Weisz you don't see many moments in this film when the acting isn't superb. Regaining a form not seen for a fair few years Hackman in particular is brilliant as a man who exploits the system for his own gain. He is closely challenged however by both Cusack and Weisz who give admirable performances in their respective roles.The film as a whole is also incredibly clever. Leading you in multiple directions the constant game of 'cat and mouse' is brilliantly played out with some noticeable surprises as well as some rather unexpected ones.It's true that there are moments when the story drags slightly and you find yourself feeling a bit bored but the majority of the time the story is fast flowing and incredibly entertaining.Anyway whatever your complaints about the script the story is mostly entertaining and well acted. Led by a superb performance by Gene Hackman when it's on a high the film is up there with the finest thrillers around in years. It's well worth watching even if you normally can't stand this sort of film.".

Usually I can find some actor or actress that wasn't very good bothered me in some way or was flat out horrible. This movie featured superb acting by all those involved. Even Jeremy Piven who I can't help but picture as the Dean in Old School or his characters from PCU or Very Bad Things delivered a respectable performance and very different from the other movies mentioned.Runaway Jury doesn't throw in a lot of needless plot twists and unexpected happenings just for the sake of throwing off or fooling the viewer. In fact it pretty much goes in the direction you think it will with only a couple of exceptions which are needed. I'm usually the type that likes my movies to get it all done in around 90 minutes or so. Seems to me that most movies that go over 2 hours have a lot of needless filler material for no real reason which more often than not results in slow dragging scenes in the movie or just a boring movie altogether. This particular movie clocked in at just over 2 hours and used every minute wisely. Nothing boring and nothing seemed to drag on forever. I found the beginning with the jury selection particularly interesting. I thought the whole concept of knowing how to get exactly who you want on your jury even before they actually show up to jury duty was a little mind blowing. After seeing those scenes I knew it was going to be a great movie. I highly recommend this movie especially if you enjoyed movies like Primal Fear although this is a completely different movie with different kinds of surprises.Overall Gene Hackman stole the show in this one and proves why he's been working in movies and television for over 40 years now. I give this 9 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Runaway Jury' is one of the best movies based on a John Grisham novel. The best is still 'The Rainmaker' probably because Francis Ford Coppola was the director who could work with a perfect ensemble of actors. Other Grisham adaptations have had terrific ensembles as well. 'The Firm' 1993 starred Tom Cruise Gene Hackman Ed Harris Jeanne Tripplehorn and Holly Hunter 'A Time to Kill' did it with Samuel L. Jackson Matthhew McConaughey Sandra Bullock Kevin Spacey Donald Dutherland Kiefer Sutherland Chris Cooper Oliver Platt and Ashley Judd and 'The Rainmaker' had to do it with only Matt Damon Danny DeVito Claire Danes Jon Voight Mickey Rourke Mary Kay Place and Danny Glover.Now here is 'Runaway Jury' starring John Cusack Gene Hackman in his third Grishammovie Dustin Hoffman and Rachel Weisz a courtroom thriller that has suspense keeps our attention and knows how to surprise. The good thing is that the movie seems to have no real good guy or girl. Hackman is Rankin Fitch a guy who spies on possible jurors to make sure he chooses the right jury for his employers. The way he does this make his the real bad guy. John Cusack is Nick Easter. He becomes a juror in a case that deals with guns and how their manufacturers are responsible for people getting killed. Fitch is on the side of the manufacturers on the other side we have lawyer Wendell Rohr Dustin Hoffman. He represents a woman who wants to sue the gunmanufacturers because her husband was killed by one of their guns.At first the movie seems to be a courtroom drama but then we learn that juror Nick Easter has his own agenda. He wanted to be in that jury for something and his girlfriend Marlee Rachel Weisz has a lot to do with that. Nick and Marlee want to give the verdict to the person Fitch or Rohr who is willing to give them the highest amount of money. Fitch is interested right away but tries to prevent this in a lot of ways Rohr slowly realizes that he has to make an offer as well since Marlee and Nick are able to show that they really own the jury. To tell you too much could spoil things for you so this is enough for the plot.With real suspense this movie keeps our attention and makes us forget that at some times things are not very plausible. There were moments I could have asked questions but during the movie I was not thinking about them only after it was finished I realized that certain events simply had to happen to keep the movie going. The way the movie just kept on going made sure we were not even able to think about possible flaws. It was interesting the entire time.Director Gary Fleder 'Kiss the Girls' 'Don't Say a Word' has made his best thriller to date with the help of a nice story and some terrific performances. Cusack is able to do almost anything Hoffman and Hackman are always reliable actors and sexy Weisz is perfect as the mysterious Marlee. Completely different from 'The Rainmaker' but almost as good as that one.".

	schema:headline " His Own Hubris";
	schema:reviewBody "John Grisham's novel Runaway Jury is based on the simple proposition that hacking into the jury pool system is an easy matter. Nobody wants jury duty people simply just do it because it's an obligation like paying taxes. Minimal safeguards are on that computer.In New York State the rule is now ten years. I just got called in October promptly and exactly ten years after I'd been called previously. You can't serve in fact if you are called any time before 10 years prior to your last service you have the clerks look it up and if you're correct out you go. But if I said nothing no one would be any the wiser. So maybe what happens in Runaway Jury might have some basis in fact.Gene Hackman is more than just a jury consultant. Breaking all laws of privacy he's on retainer from the gun manufacturer's lobby who are worried about a rash of lawsuits breaking out and somebody collecting on one. Whatever it takes to fix the jury Hackman's up to it.But there are a couple of people one a juror played by John Cusack one an outsider played by Rachel Weisz who seem to have a game plan all their own. It might just surprise you to find out just what it is.All this revolves around a wrongful death suit filed by Joanna Going and her attorney Dustin Hoffman about the death of her husband Dylan McDermott which is shown during a brief prologue. Never have the wheels of justice been so greased by so many different hands. Nice performances all around in Runaway Jury. Like another author Edna Ferber it's impossible to make a bad film out of a John Grisham work. Grisham writes so the average lay person can understand and his characters are flawed but flawed in a way you care about them. See what drives Cusack and Weisz and you'll know what I mean.Acting honors however go to Gene Hackman. Imagine the outlaw head in The Quick and the Dead running a jury consulting firm and you'll get the idea of what an amoral person Hackman is. It's his own hubris that takes him down though.Good drama by a good cast you can't go wrong with Runaway Jury.".

Dustin Hoffman is great as well but he is not in the movie as much as advertise and John Cusack is decent for the role he has. The biggest fault the movie does have is the fact that certain plot points disappear during the course of the film as well as characters. It's a great way to spend two hours of your time especially with the great performances of Gene Hackman and Rachel Weisz to keep you glued to what is happening but the movie has a lot of glaring problems that makes it hard to sit though in certain parts.".

But some how some way the film gradually loses its footing. It's as if all the interesting twists are used up in the first hour forcing the writers to pad the remainder with drawnout scenes and contrived dialog a scene where the simplistically pure Dustin Hoffman and the simplistically evil Gene Hackman meet in the men's room stands out in particular.RUNAWAY JURY also commits a near unforgivable flaw for fictitious entertainment it's too damn preachy. Once again and in typical Hollywood fashion guns and those who make them are portrayed as a type of grotesque venom stuck to the bottom of your shoe. Indeed viewers who believe criminals not firearm makers are responsible for gun crime are treated as something of a parasite best exemplified by a raving juror played a gruff Cliff Curtis.In the end RUNAWAY JURY is a film that is difficult to critique. It certainly has more right with it than wrong but the negative aspects somehow disproportionately consume the final product. Some will absolutely love it others may absolutely hate it but most will probably be entertained yet disappointed at the same time.".

Gene Hackman makes an excellent bad guy as the lawyer for the gun industry and there are several good supporting roles especially that of Bruce Mc Gill as the judge.

The Good Some of the performances are spectacular and deserving of a much better movie than this. Gene Hackman hasn't been this good in ages and he's one of the few reasons that this movie is watchable. The next reason is Rachel Weisz who is the only actor Hackman has had in quite some time that is his equal in performance and in acting prowess. She is so good in fact that she does almost steal the film from him and then some. The city of New Orleans is a fascinating setting for this film but wrong because it's not the original setting of the book. The Bad Dustin Hoffman is not really in the movie and is really a minor character in the whole story. Which is too bad because he's such a charismatic actor and deserves a much bigger role than what he had. The next problem is the whole spy versus spy angle that makes the whole film into a joke because no one would go that far to rig a jury especially in a case that would have been thrown out of a real court with the facts that was presented in the film. Which leads to.The Ugly The script is really bad. How bad you say? It took almost four writers to outline the story which bare in mind does not follow the book at all. The dialog is great in places and bad in others and the whole structure of the film is paperthin which is easily to blow holes thru. The story runs out of gas in the half way point of the film and the ideas express seems more like a bias view of what the law should be than a realistic view of what the law really is. I think the biggest offence the movie makes is changing the text of the original novel and making about guns other than big tobacco. John Grisham's original novel was hugely entertaining and down right poignant in its views about justice. This film seems like it has not idea where it's at from time to time and lacks a coherent narrative to even try to explain the stuff that is going on right in front of you.Even with the good points the bad does out weight the good here. It's a decent film because of the acting of Rachel Weisz and Gene Hackman but they like the viewer are let down with a script that lacks conviction for the subject it covers and a real point of view that expresses the feelings of the reality of the gun issue.".

The story isn't brought as heavy as other Grisham adaptations such as The Firm The Client and The Pelican Brief. Compared to that movies this movie also has a far more superior style and atmosphere.The cast is impressive and filled with stars such as John Cusack Gene Hackman Dustin Hoffman and Rachel Weisz. For some reason I had the feeling that the Dustin Hoffman character was pushed a bit too much to the background at moments especially towards the end. The supporting cast is wonderful and is filled with some solid supporting actors such as Bruce Davison Bruce McGill which I love! Nick Searcy Stanley Anderson Cliff Curtis Nestor Serrano Luis Guzmn Dylan McDermott and Leland Orser all big names in the business. The movie might very well have the best supporting cast of the last couple of years.The HackmanHoffman scene is really good and one if not THE highlight of the movie.The movie offers a few surprising plot twists especially towards the ending which I really loved! The movie is far from boring especially for a court drama and has a good quick pace but still a bit too many ridicules and unbelievable moments.Not a great movie but still very enjoyable.710httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

In New Orleans a highclass stock broker Dylan McDermott is gunned down in his office along with 10 other coworkers. Fast forward a little and his widow Joanna Going is taking the manufacturers of the gun that ultimately killed her husband to court in a nationally imperative suit. The gun manufacturers take no chances in the verdict as they decide to get the shady Gene Hackman in a delightfully wicked role to go behind the scenes literally via surveillance equipment public records and everything else at his disposal to help lawyer Bruce Davison choose a jury that will deliver a notguilty verdict. On the other side of the coin Southern attorney Dustin Hoffman is trying to strike a major blow against the American gun industry. He is a straightshooter and has a sense of moral duty but he is visibly shaken when antiHackman specialist Jeremy Piven visits him as the trial is about to start and explains that his services are needed if Hoffman is going to be able to sway the jury to his side. It is apparent quite quickly that electronics store employee John Cusack is the primary juror who is going to take centerstage. Soon we realize though that he may have ulterior motives of his own. He keeps popping up around with the beautiful but suspicious Rachel Weisz and it becomes pretty obvious that the duo may not be strangers at all. They might even be working together in an elaborate scheme to control the jury and force Hackman's people and Hoffman's people to sweat over what the verdict will be. Why would they be doing this? Well for millions of dollars of course but is that the only reason and how noble or how deviant are their methods in reality? Runaway Jury kept me guessing and confused for most all its running time this is a compliment. Just when I thought everything was crystal clear the film jumped to chaos and jumbled the atmosphere of the picture once again. Hackman dominates and Hoffman matches his brilliance blow by dizzying blow. Cusack and Weisz definitely have a chemistry and end up being a dynamic duo with deceptively difficult parts to pull off. Everyone else is good enough to make the thing work. The ending is somewhat hohum really but I liked the vast majority of the movie well enough to give it a positive rating. 4 stars out of 5.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hollywood demonstrates once again its' venomous hatred for guns and gun owners except when using guns to shoot dozens of people in needlessly gory scenes in movies! by changing the basic story line in 'Runaway Jury' from a trial against the tobacco  companies to one about punishing gun companies. Grisham's original plot essentially a rehash of one he's done before about insiders beating criminals at their own game a David versus Goliath theme in the book was about Big Tobacco perverting a jury trial with paid 'consultants' who'll stoop to anything including murder to get their client the verdict they desire.

Grisham's original plot essentially a rehash of one he's done before about insiders beating criminals at their own game a David versus Goliath theme in the book was about Big Tobacco perverting a jury trial with paid 'consultants' who'll stoop to anything including murder to get their client the verdict they desire.

	schema:reviewBody "It is not a perfect film it has flaws the most obvious being the pseudo psycho babble that could have been achieved with greater effect by having said less but having said it better. It is a romance it is romantic it is sexy and it is a slice of life their lives a small part that keeps the rest of their lives from being without charm. There is no need to contemplate the past or their futures but the moments that make the present happiness complete. The film proves that sex between mature adults can be beautiful and not bound by the petty mores of witless societies that demand sex take place between pnuematically enhanced teenagers and souless males who would not understand the rhythms of sex without a street directory. Nathalie Baye was 51 when she made this film and has an attractive body but she has a great way of making herself erotically desirable. Any person that has never laughed joked or cried during sex has not had much good sex. It is the casual and caring ease between the leads that demonstrates how sex can be imtimate and romantic and caring. The people who call this movie cold have looked at it from the director's eyes and have failed to capture the warmth of the two leads. The title I think is in the French style of ironic a word missing from the American dictionary rather than the British sense of the word. While the British treat irony like a Shakespearean tragedy the French equate it more with the little death and regard it more as humour tainted with pathos. The French idea of tragedy is to leave the ending out of movies but perhaps I am over using irony here. If you have 80 minutes to spare to think about the relationships in your own life then this little movie just might help you explore your own heart a little more. And remember a movie without flaws is called Looney Tunes.".

Of course they become emotionally involved and then the question becomes will they continue? This is a very nicely judged piece using a combination of interview sequences intercut with flashbacks. There are no distractions we focus almost entirely on Nathalie and Sergi as they are interviewed separately about their affair.

The curious thing is that although intimacy develops it follows the rules of the original impersonal pornographic encounter  no names no talk about jobs and families and friends no swapping of personal detail. They meet once or twice a week in the same coffee bar and hotel room for six months or more yet still know virtually nothing about each other apart from their sexual fantasies. Why this holding back?

She does have trouble expressing her feelings  for her I love you' are the hardest words in the language all right Je t'aime'. Sergi Lopez as her homme de jour is a bit more emotionally expressive but still holds himself back.I suppose one could see the film as suggesting that the alienation of modern life can be traced to an unwillingness to become emotionally attached that life is faster and cleaner if relationships are disposable without much pain. These two want intimacy but they don't want to pay for it.It's a wellmade movie with plenty of Parisian bustle and lots of nice closeups. It's all a bit sad though.

All this is told in flashback with both speaking separately and wistfully about what happenedand how it ended. This is a fascinating story appealingly told with sureness by director Frederic Foteyne and his attractive expressive leads. Yes their affair is casual sexual and without the usual meeting cute baggage. Actually I thought she was the engine that began and ended the affair. Lopez's character seems to be far more emotionally involved as the affair progress than Baye's. He responds to herresponding to him and you can see him falling for her. Her speech to him about her feelings is quite startling and you think maybe he's going to seek hercommitment. A happy ending though this is not one of those silly tearjerkers where you sit there embarrassed would have been wrong and it's very satisfying. I loved this small quiet movie. The sex is very discreet. The dialoge is direct and thank goodness this is not a wordy movie. It doesn't need it. It's got a very good director in control of his material and two fine leads who tell you all you need to know. I just discovered Sergi Lopez was the villain in DIRTY PRETTY THINGS. He's a terrific screen presence. Someone mentioned CHAOS in connection with their review of this filmanother French film I recently discovered.

It's one of those movies that stabs at your heart every now and then. You know what you want to happen but at the same time you know it won't. I love Natalie Baye and Sergi Lopez. Both actors are incredible in their own rights and wonderful together. The characters that they helped create only further that. I love how there are no names no phone numbers no address. There's only each other and that room. As the viewer we don't even get to see what happens in that room except for the more normal scenes. At the end of the movie I can't help but wonder... what happened in that room and I watch it over and over to find out what happens and I never do. If anyone does let me know. I'm still dying to find out. At the end of the movie anyone who's seen it knows it ends with an unhappy ending but I can't help but think it will end differently. I always watch it and wait hoping for something I know won't happen. It makes it end all the more beautifully despite the fact that I still think in my twisted little head that perhaps the 'behind the scenes' guys gave them their phone numbers and names and they ended up together. Of course when I know that my version didn't go as planned I feel a deep sorrow. It's like two of my best friends breaking up and ruining everyone's lives...Of course everything makes it all the more beautiful.I also love the way that the movie is brought out. It's a fictional movie with fictional characters presented as a documentary.".

	schema:reviewBody "Notwithstanding their national origins Belgium director Frdric Fonteyne and Iranian scenarist Philippe Blasband have managed to create the quintessential French film a film created for adults with a theme to match unusual maybe but still taken out of real life psychological philosophical and challenging to the viewer. Fonteyne in spite of his young age born in 1968 speaks about love and feelings with great maturity. He mystifies the viewer with his approach to modern sexuality.Blasband's scenario presents his love story upsidedown. Starting from a fantasy which will eventually end up in love he surrounds the slow but inevitable drift of the protagonists' feelings for each other. Refined with simple and subtle dialogue he facilitated enormously the director's work. The two characters recount to a third party with emotion and an air of propriety the passion that they were unable either to control or to really confess to each other. We know that their experiment was a failure because from the outset their testimonies indicate that they are apart. But the way each talks about the other makes us want to discover this other. We would like to get involved in their story know their pasts their presents and understand why they speak about the other with so much nostalgia. They will never know each other's names their ages professions. What they do after their trysts we'll never know either.The rhythm and content of the story is controlled by the two protagonists who refuse to disclose the nature of their fantasy allowing the director to impose upon the viewer the role of voyeur by limiting the viewer's space to that of the fantasy never revealed. Actually the word pornographique in the original title Une Affaire Pornographique is a joke as there is nothing pornographic about this film. Unfortunately the American title denies Fonteyne's intention to fully condition right from the start the viewer's state of mind. Each time the camera in the red hotel hallway bumps against the closed door of room 118 it renews and heightens the voyeurviewer's interest. This contrasts sharply with the only time the camera penetrates in the lovers' blue room to witness a banal love scene which in fact leaves the viewer even more bewildered as to the nature of the fantasy.The success of this film rests entirely on the flawless acting of Nathalie Baye and Sergi Lopez. These two actors developed chemistry which is the undeniable sign of mature artists. Their interaction is totally genuine in their exchanges both verbal and unspoken. We can read on her face the birth of her love for He she wants to be happy next to this man this one and none other. He drinks cognac and dips sugar cubes into it while undressing her with his eyes. We can tell that this man knows how to love women mixing tenderness with desire. There are also their gestures Her expressing herself with her hands admitting her need to always talk even during lovemaking. He is reserved observant always answering her many questions.The camera movements often consist of static shots on the two characters in mediumclose shots and close shots contributing further to the viewer's probing into the two characters psyches.The original film score is some electronic music unfortunately up to now unavailable on CD by Andr Dziezuk Marc Mergen and Jeannot Sanavia. When the credits are rolling one hears a downtempotriphop drum and bass music which recalls Funki Porcini. It all fits perfectly with this unreal situation.The main theme of this film is boundaries and their perilous crossings. At the beginning of the film She is within her own world inside her own boundary. This is symbolically represented during the opening as a crowd of pedestrians seen from her point of view out of focus. She has a sexual fantasy but in order to satisfy it she will have to cross the first boundary one set by society. Her fantasy cannot be fulfilled with members of her own entourage husband or intimate friends. For this She must look beyond the boundaries of socially accepted behavior to a stranger. As both meet they will be beyond society's boundaries in their fantasy world. This accomplished they breach another boundary when feelings develop the boundary fixed by love. A whole new world appears to them a totally unexpected world. Finally there are the boundaries of understanding and commitment which they are unable to cross for previously mentioned reasons. At the very end of the film we see again a crowd of pedestrians out of focus she is back within the confines of her own boundary.Fonteyne shows us a modern society where sex is no longer taboo but love is becoming such. He never moralizes or resolves these apparent contradictions but instead brings them into harmony as never done before him the modern world denying love and the JudeoChristian world negating sexuality. In the process Fonteyne destroys the actuation of the fantasy and reinstates it in the secret in the intimacy both personal and private of the viewer.Finally the film tackles another great theme in the relationship between man and woman the incommunicability. The fears that each feels the fear of love the fear of confessing the love one bears for the other to the other the fear of appearing ridiculous the fear that the feeling may not be reciprocated or has not progressed as rapidly in the other. The final scene at the caf reveals and underscores a cruel intense moment the like of which I do not remember having ever witnessed in any film before. Very little is actually said as most of the dialogue is in individual voiceovers. All the walls come crashing down on one woman and one man who by all accounts we judge were meant to be united for life. And this failure in a relationship which we were starting to take for granted is due to their incapacity to communicate.".

The title I also like because this is precisely a story of a liaison that started at least in a pornographic sense. The music in particular the track that opens and closes the film is superb I can say no more about it! The script is very original it is a study of the most intrinsic and human aspects of a relationship. I have also noted subtle similarities with Francois Triffault's film The woman next door.

The common American title An Affair of Love is not a literal translation so maybe that was it I wanted to see A Pornographic Affair. I don't know.In it's most basic sense this is a chick flick. Two people meet through an ad arrange a liaison at a hotel to act out their fantasies fall in love and split. Well the split part would not be satisfying to most. But it is so much more that that. I could not take my eyes off the screen for fear of missing one word. There was nothing pornographic about this film it was a beautiful love story.Nathalie Baye Catch Me If You Can Le Petit lieutenant is an adult. She was 51 when she made this film. This is not a WB teen sex story. Sergi Lpez Pan's Labyrinth was almost 20 years younger. This was a film about two adults who met to have sex. No strings no pretensions just acting out sexual fantasies. We never learn what that fantasy was. Belgiun director Frdric Fonteyne and writer Philippe Blasband left that to our imaginations and I thank them for it. Their work makes me want to see their latest collaboration Gilles' Wife even more.As Baye and Lopez meet each Thursday you can see the transformation. The sex is a given and out of the way. They are free to communicate as a man and a woman. They share every thought and feeling except who they really are. Names marital status jobs etc. are not mentioned ever. It is communication that I have never had and have never seen. It was beautiful.I said they fall in love and they split. I will not say more because that would spoil it for anyone who happens to catch this film. It is what makes this such a beautiful love story.I said I wanted to see Gilles' Wife to see more from this director and writer. I also want to see more of Baye and Lopez. Having said that I am not so sure as I do not want to see something less that this film and spoil it. I cannot get this movie out of my head.Highly recommended.".

However the initially sexual relationship becomes more complicated when they become sentimentally involved and start liking each other.Une liaison pornographique is an honest and pure movie about love sex and human relations which lacks all the usual paraphernalia ornament and romanticism. I liked specially the initial scene when the camera shows an unfocused view of the crowd with faces that come and go never staying too much time. This scene made me think of how modern life is in the cities where we seem to be bees in a giant beehive simply passing through life without any purpose at all. From this scene on the film shows how difficult it is to maintain a relationship based on something so natural as sex between two adult responsible and free people. The film also shows how feelings may interfere and complicate human relationships and how easy it is to misunderstand each other's feelings.Although the title may suggest otherwise the film advances mainly through the conversations of the two starring characters previously to the sexual encounters that take place in a little hotel's room. Sex is shown only when it is strictly necessary and in a delicate way the spectators never get to know what her fantasy is since the camera lingers through the hotel's corridors during the act so people looking for explicit sex will be deceived. The performance of Nathalie Baye and Sergi Lopez is convincing as two ordinary people with sexual and emotional needs succeeding in involucrating the spectator in their private universe. In conclusion a movie that is worth seeing.".

In short we are never allowed to become involved with them in any way other than as voyeurs watching them analyze their feelings as they try to figure out if they are falling in love while leaving us with a feeling of detachment....outsiders looking in with the real story just beyond our reach as the film serves up one bit of story at a time all the way to its anticlimactic conclusion. For some the enigmatic nature of the film will be enough. For others the film will prove tedious.";

	schema:reviewBody "I can't remember a really good film noir being made in quite some time. There may have been a handful of good or decent film noirs recently but the bad outnumber them by about 100 to 1.I went into Carl Franklin's Out of Time with a certain amount of interestI wasn't sure what to expect. I knew that it was a crime thrillerfilm noir about a guy who gets caught up in some type of crime but other than that I really had no idea what the film was like. It hadn't gotten extremely good reviews although most of them were at least positive and that lowered my expectations a bit. I had finally come to expect a fairly decent thriller with illogical plot holes and a boring pace.I was wrong.With a backtoback viewing of David Spade's Dickie Roberts Former Child Star and Out of Time there was a nice contrast going which may explain why I enjoyed the film so very much. But there's one thing for certainit's a lot cleverer than most films of its kind.Matt Whitlock Denzel Washington is running out of time. He's been framed for murder and has to cover his tracks before the clues start to pile up against him. And there are a lot of clues pointing not only in his direction but directly at him.Matt is the police chief of a small town in Florida. Nobody suspects him. But he is sole beneficiary on the female victim's life insurance claim. And right before she died Matt took over 400000 worth of confiscated drug money and planned to run off with her. Nobody knew they were having an affair because she was a married woman and they were keeping their romantic adventures secret. She made Matt her beneficiary after being diagnosed with cancerbut now she's been discovered dead in a fire with her husband the money gone and all the evidence pointsas I said beforeto him. Fortunately the police officials haven't picked up any traces. Yet. So in a frantic race for time Matt has to cover up all his tracks before the find out.The doctor who diagnosed her cancer is gone. The money is gone. Matt's exwife Eva Mendes is bent on finding the killer and sooner or later she'll figure out that Matt was having an affair that he had a motive to kill over 1000000 dollars etc. But will she find out the real truth That he is innocent?This stuff's been done before even I'll admit that. But this time it's great. Everything about this movie works from the style with all the vivid brightness of Florida portrayed in films such as Scarface or Get Shorty to the acting Denzel strikes again! to direction Carl Franlin brings a distinct style to the film. From the opening credits I had a big smile on my face. This was a pleasant twist on film noir.Admittedly the first half hour is rather slow. I almost came close to giving the film a negative review. But then the chain of events rolled in like a onetwo punch fast furious and everything you could wish for in a mystery. And unlike some films when you stop to take a look at the plot twists in Out of Time...they actually make sense.Denzel Washington is one of the best actors in Hollywood he can lift any film out of mediocrity including that underrated supernatural thriller Fallen with John Goodman. He is simply amazing always able to bring a sense of realism to his roles and he does this in Out of TimeI never doubted his role for a minute. That's pretty rare.I would say that Out of Time is one of the best films of the year. It seems real with likable characters portrayed by a strong cast including John Billinglsey as Chae Matt's best friend who shows up when he's needed the most. In retrospect a lot of these characters seem pretty typical and routine. But when I was watching the film it seemed extremely realistic and convincing. That's always a good sign.Out of Time is rated PG13 for some sexuality violence and language. Rerated from a mild R after a few scene cuts.45 stars.John Ulmer".

I decided to kill some time watching it not expecting very much. I must say that I was pleasantly surprised.I should identify that the movie has nothing to do with the Rolling Stones' song. Denzel Washington plays Matt Whitlock a cop in a small Florida town. He's been having an affair with a certain Ann Sanaa Lathan. Since she's dying of cancer she's made him the beneficiary of her will. But when she and her husband die in a fire all evidence points to Matt you'll understand what I mean if you see the movie. So arises the quandary of how he's going to solve the case and clear his name before it's too late especially given that his exwife Alex Eva Mendes is absolutely intent on solving the case.The movie's real strength lies in the twists and turns that they throw in from time to time. I think that probably the coolest scene is the whole sequence in the police station about halfway through the movie I would have never imagined any movie having a whole sequence like that! But I actually considered Matt's friend Chae John Billingsley to be the best character in the movie I mean some of those monologues were so great.All in all it's not any kind of masterpiece. But it's better than your average manontherunhastoclearhimself story. And if I may say so Eva Mendes looked mighty fine in some of those outfits!".

	schema:headline " Denzel gives this class!!";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a good standard and efficient thriller starring Denzel Washington. The film is pretty routine but by having Denzel the film is given extra class. Anyway the story centers around Denzel's character Matt Whitlock a police chief. He is seeing married woman Ann Merai Harrison Sanaa Lathan behind the back of major league Ahole Chris Dean Superman' Cain. Ann is dying of cancer and she and Denzel want to be together but the problem is she has to have expensive treatment abroad. Ann transfers her life insurance policy and makes Matt the sole beneficiary. When they decide to cash in on the policy Denzel loses his sense of morals and is overcome by his love for Ann. He steals 500000 of confiscated drugs money that is in an evidence lock up. He give it to Ann and sets up a meeting. He knows that further down the line they can cash the insurance policy and he can return the money without anyone noticing because as he points out These goods can be left unchecked for months'. Problems arise however when he goes to meet Ann and she has apparently been burnt alive in her house. He had been there earlier in the night and was spotted by a nosy neighbour so Denzel is now in trouble he was spotted by someone and he has motive to have killed her. He soon discovers that she was not in fact ill and is actually still alive. It seems she was hustling him good and proper and Den must now investigate secretly to discover her whereabouts retrieve the drug money which is now to be collected by IA as luck would have it.The film is undemanding simple stuff to be honest. The plot doesn't get too convoluted and the pacing is good. The twists and turns happen at good moments and keep the entertainment levels constant. Denzel is excellent albeit in a role he could do with one arm tied behind his back his eyes closed and with a pineapple lodged between his buttcheeks. Eva Mendes that saucy Latin minx is also good as Denzels exwife who becomes suspicious of his increasingly nervy and strange behaviour. Sanaa Lathan is also good as is John Billingsley as Matt's slobbish friend. The one who really impressed me though was Dean Cain in a superbly nasty role as Lathan's abusive husband. Cain has never really found much success in his movie career doing cheap action movies that gather dust on the bottom shelves of Blockbusters. It is a shame really because Cain is likeable and has some charisma. He was good in Superman but a lot of TV stars are unable to make the transition to movie star because it requires a different kind of presence and charisma. Lorenzo Lamas is an example of someone similar. He looks a worse actor than he is having done so many low budget b pictures. For me seems too nice to be an action man. If he only takes some of the hardness and nastiness from this role and transfers it to his heroic roles he might get better offers in lead roles. However I don't seeing him as a leading man to be honest. He really does give a good performance in this and I'd like to see him in a few bigger films.Carl Franklin directs proceedings with assurance and when the action kicks in he paces it well he is good and safe without having the exceptional in his locker. Graeme Revell is a composer who is generally hit and miss and this score is hit. It is nicely understated and works well. All in all this is good entertainment. ".

	schema:reviewBody "Out of Time is directed by Carl Franklin and written by David Collard. It stars Denzel Washington Eva Mendes Sanaa Lathan Dean Cain and John Billingsley. Music is by Graeme Revell and cinematography by Theo Van de Sande.Matthias Whitlock Washington is chief of police in little Banyan Key Florida. Respected for his work and basically honest in the line of duty. Away from work however his marriage to Alex Mendes has failed he's having an affair with an abused wife and he likes a little drink on duty. So when his lover Anne Harrison Lathan springs on him the shocking news that she has been diagnosed with terminal cancer it naturally shakes his world. But this news is merely the start of something bigger for pretty soon Matt will be in the unusual situation of having to stay one step of his own kind or face dire consequences.It's a film proudly wearing a badge of homage to film noir of the 40s. In fact it very much plays out as a contemporary riff on John Farrow's excellent Ray Milland starrer of 1948 The Big Clock. But that's fine especially when you have some knowing craft in front and behind the camera in the shape of Franklin Devil in a Blue Dress and Washington take your pick here really!. Yet as great as Franklin and Washington's work is they all owe a debt to Collard's screenplay. Inventive in how it plays out as a plot with it's many tight situations laid down for Washington's duped law enforcer to try and get out of the screenplay has a knack for deft humour often sly which is something that even some of the hardest of noirs from the golden era are tinted with. The secret is being able to blend the humour with quality moments of suspense and this picture manages to do that with some interest.Film also benefits greatly from the tight atmosphere created by photographer de Sande. Sweaty Florida in daylight doesn't cry out as being a good starting point for an offshoot of film noir real Florida locations were thankfully used but the scenic beauty is never realised during the drama sequences colours are toned down even for a stunning red sky and this perfectly becomes at one with a near frantic Washington as the tricksters of Banyan Key start to close in on him. It's nice too see also interracial couples forming the core of the story while the dominance of sexuality is firmly given a shrewd work over by director and writer. There's good thought gone in to making this enough to steer it away from charges of just being a faux neonoir production.Problems? Yes a few. Inevitability of outcome is hard to shake off whilst viewing it especially for those well versed in the genre subgenre. Clichs and contrivances are stacked up like a pile of cop thriller 101 books and Franklin goes smug daft by dropping in a couple of slow frame sequences that the film clearly didn't need. While the big showdown in the finale lacks a gut punch. But this is a good viewing sexy at times and always eye catching it also pleasingly chooses perky dialogue over action to make its dramatic point. The cast around Washington enhance the quality Lathan in the tricky role shows a number of layered gears Cain is imposing as a bully boy husband where did this Cain go? and Billingsley almost sneaks in and steals the movie as the loyal and stoic comedy sidekick.So pesky flaws aside this is a good recommendation as a night in movie for those with a kink for contemporary neonoir. 710".

When Ann tells him that her husband has changed the details of her life insurance policy Matt agrees to be named the new beneficiary in order to keep any payout safe. Meanwhile under pressure to help her treatment Matt takes drug money from the police safe however when Ann and her husband are both killed in an arson attack on their home a murder investigation is launched  with Matt's exwife Alex heading it up. Initially quick to cover all links between him and Ann Matt soon finds that all the clues are starting to point to him and realises that he is being framed.Despite a solid and sexy cast this looked too much like an average crime thriller to bother me to go to the cinema. However on DVD I decided to give it a go over the weekend as it seemed more suited to the small screen. Indeed the plot is no great shakes and is essentially a series of little set pieces on the way to a twist that was so apparent that the film doesn't even really deliver it with any great effort. However this is not to say it is no good but just that it is nothing particularly special. The direction is good and it really helps the film keep a good sense of pace in the way the camera spins around in even the office environment but really it is the cast that make this stand out from the many other crime thrillers that never make it to the cinema.Washington may well be slumming it here he criticised it because he said all he did was run but he holds the attention really well. His character doesn't really act like he should do and sometimes he is just plain wrong but Washington is suitably frantic and sweaty like a man hemmed in on all sides. Mendes is enjoyable even if she has no real character to speak of either while Lathan rounds out the sex appeal with an OK performance but hardly the femme fatale that she should have been. Cain does better than he usually does and credit to him that he does manage to hold his own with Washington. Generally none of the lead three really act at the level that they can but their presence makes it more interesting.Overall my and most viewers assumptions were mostly right  it is an enjoyable little thriller but not one that is really worth hunting down. The big name cast are sexy and do reasonably well with the little they are given and director Franklin injects more pace that it probably deserved and the end result is a solid enough little film but not one that really does anything special.".

	schema:headline " Suspense Action  Great Entertainment";
	schema:reviewBody "Out Of Time is full of excitement danger and suspense and although its rather intricate plot is very familiar in nature it's totally gripping from start to finish. Inspiration for the story was obviously drawn from all those film noirs about a guy who makes a bad decision which gets him into a fix and then has to race against time to prove his innocence. The significance to the story of a life insurance policy is reminiscent of Double Indemnity 1944 and the presence of a hapless man who's involved in an investigation where he knows that all the evidence is certain to point to his guilt brings to mind The Big Clock 1948. There's even a scene in a hotel where Denzel Washington is unable to leave by the main exit because of all the activity in the foyer and this replicates a very similar situation in The Big Clock where Ray Milland is confronted by the same type of problem.This movie very successfully combines its themes of adultery larceny and murder with action sequences amusing plot twists and a good deal of humour to produce some terrific entertainment. The photography and direction are top class and the locations used contribute greatly to the sultry atmosphere of the whole piece.Matt Whitlock Denzel Washington is the Chief of Police in the small town of Banyan Key Florida.

	onyx:emotionText "Out Of Time is full of excitement danger and suspense and although its rather intricate plot is very familiar in nature it's totally gripping from start to finish. Inspiration for the story was obviously drawn from all those film noirs about a guy who makes a bad decision which gets him into a fix and then has to race against time to prove his innocence. The significance to the story of a life insurance policy is reminiscent of Double Indemnity 1944 and the presence of a hapless man who's involved in an investigation where he knows that all the evidence is certain to point to his guilt brings to mind The Big Clock 1948. There's even a scene in a hotel where Denzel Washington is unable to leave by the main exit because of all the activity in the foyer and this replicates a very similar situation in The Big Clock where Ray Milland is confronted by the same type of problem.This movie very successfully combines its themes of adultery larceny and murder with action sequences amusing plot twists and a good deal of humour to produce some terrific entertainment. The photography and direction are top class and the locations used contribute greatly to the sultry atmosphere of the whole piece.Matt Whitlock Denzel Washington is the Chief of Police in the small town of Banyan Key Florida. His wife is in the process of divorcing him and he's involved in a passionate affair with Ann Merai Harrison Sanaa Lathan who used to be his childhood sweetheart.

	schema:headline " Flawed but still exciting suspense film Denzel is excellent as always";
	schema:reviewBody "The question here is who is the bad guy...who is the badder guy. And who is going to win. It's that simple.Denzel Washington is the chief of police in a small town along the Florida Keys. He has 450000 in drug money in a safe...the booty from a drug bust that is both local and federally related. He is getting divorced from his wife a homicide detective Eva Mendes and is currently dating a young woman played by Sanaa Lathan whose husband Dean Cain is a security guard. Lathan has been diagnosed with terminal cancer and Denzel decides to give her the drug money to buy experimental cancer drugs instead of turning it over to the feds. After doing so her body and her husband's body  and the money ?  are apparently found in their burned out house. Circumstantially Denzel will appear guilty and in part he is but not of murder. And then the discoveries begin  a fake doctor and a very alive supposedly burned to death couple.In terms of plot what I like about this film is that the twists and turns begin early on not just near the end...and they seem logical instead of convenient. BUT  as Denzel gets almost caught over and over and over and over and over you finally begin to say Too much. So the plot is just a bit too much but the performances make up for that. Denzel is as solid as ever here and it's interesting how the director let the 5 o'clock shadow grow during the darkest period when we begin to wonder just how bad a guy he really is. Although the two female leads will never be favorites of mine they both did very well here  Eva Mendes and Sanaa Lathan.

	onyx:emotionText "The question here is who is the bad guy...who is the badder guy. And who is going to win. It's that simple.Denzel Washington is the chief of police in a small town along the Florida Keys. He has 450000 in drug money in a safe...the booty from a drug bust that is both local and federally related. He is getting divorced from his wife a homicide detective Eva Mendes and is currently dating a young woman played by Sanaa Lathan whose husband Dean Cain is a security guard. Lathan has been diagnosed with terminal cancer and Denzel decides to give her the drug money to buy experimental cancer drugs instead of turning it over to the feds. After doing so her body and her husband's body  and the money ?  are apparently found in their burned out house. Circumstantially Denzel will appear guilty and in part he is but not of murder. And then the discoveries begin  a fake doctor and a very alive supposedly burned to death couple.In terms of plot what I like about this film is that the twists and turns begin early on not just near the end...and they seem logical instead of convenient. BUT  as Denzel gets almost caught over and over and over and over and over you finally begin to say Too much. So the plot is just a bit too much but the performances make up for that. Denzel is as solid as ever here and it's interesting how the director let the 5 o'clock shadow grow during the darkest period when we begin to wonder just how bad a guy he really is. Although the two female leads will never be favorites of mine they both did very well here  Eva Mendes and Sanaa Lathan. Dean Cain who I feel is an underappreciated actor  does well as one of the villains though he doesn't get a lot of screen time. John Billingsley is interesting as the best friend of the chief.Every movie has its flaws and this film is no exception. Nevertheless it's a decidedly good suspense film and I recommend it.";

Denzel's acting was great but other cast members occasionally seemed a little lost.  The direction was also pretty good but Carl Franklin seemed to have a little trouble pacing the movie with a couple scenes seeming completely out of place.  The music also by Graeme Revell was pretty good but wasn't exemplary or especially dramatic.  The cinematography was good but didn't really stand out while the screenplay also lagged in places.

	schema:reviewBody "Nothing much seems to go on in this small lazy SouthFlorida town. Just as little is done by its sheriff Matt Lee Whitlock Denzel Washington a fact well illustrated in an early scene of him polishing off a beer his legs propped up on his office desk. Maybe he's bored. Or maybe drinking beers on the job is just what one does to make it through the humid summers down there. There is one thing happening an affair he has been nurturing on the side with a steamy young woman Ann who calls in an attempted robbery as a sort of thrilling preamble to sizzling sex with the sheriff when he shows up. He may be the lazy type but you cannot say he's not careful. And the scene does sizzle. Ann is played by the very appealing Sanaa Lathan and married to a jobless professional quarterback Chris Dean Cain who spends his time working at the county morgue. It is made very clear from the beginning the only thing Matt and Chris have in common other than Gorgeous Ann is a mutual distaste for one another. So the stage has been set for the rest of Out of Time a frenetic sometimes tense thriller that by force of star power and sure direction just manages to elevate itself above the unremarkable genre which binds it.Many movies before this one have told the story of the innocent man trying to extricate himself from a sticky situation proving his innocence while at the same time trying to catch the bad guy. The Fugitive comes to mind as one of the better variations on the theme and there are of course many lesser versions as well. In this film it's Chief Whitlock who's stuck in a mess. And though there may or not be others involved in putting him there he has for the most part no one to blame but himself for his lousy predicament. And of course this all involves a host of details and plot particulars which are not mine to tell. Let's just say that it involves these factors his lover Ann a double murder a life insurance policy his exwife investigating the murder the D.E.A. and hundreds of thousands of dollars in confiscated drug bust money. And in the middle of this swamp of ingredients wades Whitlock himself  caught very much by surprise no longer bored and now with a sense of urgency bordering on panic. And as the title suggests time doesn't look to be on his side.Out of Time was directed by Carl Franklin who is capable and experienced at his craft. Two of his films One False Move and One True Thing were alike in more than one way. While their stories were completely unrelated they both featured strong casts absorbing dialog and measured observant direction. With One False Move a film about outlaws on the run through the deep South Franklin was adept at controlling the pace of the story keenly evoking suspense when needed allowing for tense dramatic pauses when called for. He brings that element of pacing to this movie saturating the earlier scenes with slowburn slide guitar music and swelteringly slow shots of the Floridian landscape. Then suddenly as Chief Whitlock becomes enmeshed in his race for time so does the film's entire speed. That the audience stay on board through countless contrived chase sequences can be attributed mainly to Franklin keeping them there. Here he has a much less inspired story to work with having to enlist some extra help from the actors. The supporting cast are convincing in their roles. Eva Mendes who continues to show great onscreen promise plays Whitlock's estranged wife. The two actors create just the right kind of chemistry as two people who are apart for good reason it seems but who still like each other enough to be able to have civilized conversations while working together on the murder investigation.But the real glue holding the ordinariness together is Denzel Washington. Once again he has brought to the screen intelligence wit integrity and yes the likability quotient. He always seems to convey these appealing traits through his characters including those we are not meant to like at all. Even in Training Day where he played a dirty despicable cop much of the movie focused on his character's ability to convince his partner and us that he was doing the right thing. In Out of Time Denzel's Whitlock is a sympathetic character to be sure. He is generally respected by the members of the county he runs. We forgive him his faults as we do the poor decisions he makes while painting himself into a seemingly inescapable corner. Then as the film progresses and as his methods of extrication go from unscrupulous to outright illegal we wonder aloud why we have been on his side through the whole thing. This man may not be a sinner but neither is he the picture of saintliness. It doesn't seem to wash but there you have it. But Denzel pulls it off through the whole movie gracing Chief Whitlock with virtuous sympathetic qualities he does not possess. Toward the end of the movie anyone paying attention to the clock would notice that the movie itself is almost out of time  probably not nearly enough time to resolve the laundry list of problems Whitlock has burdened himself with. The film nonetheless scurries to its disappointing pat resolution careful to tighten most of the loose ends it can remember but done with such brevity as to leave us all feeling a little pinched and more than a little let down. This kind of pinched finish effectively washes away all of the potentially intriguing character dilemmas presented in the character of Matt Lee Whitlock. Still the actor playing him is Denzel so we don't mind feeling happy for him in spite of his and the film's many shortcomings.".

Blessed with one of the most fertile imaginations in modern cinema equally renowned as an animator filmmaker and iconoclast he has made a handful of highly original singleminded films most of which are now considered classics although it tends to take a few years before critical revisionism regards his work as such I bet few recall The Adventures of Baron Munchhausen was first considered a costly bomb on par with Heaven's Gate. But of late he has had to suffer a critical beating for his mainstreamdesigned The Brothers Grimm not to mention the welldocumented collapse of The Man Who Killed Don Quixote why does the word schadenfreude come to mind? and more often than not he is regarded as somewhat of a brilliant madman with integrity to burn willing to battle Hollywood at any cost to keep his visions intact.Now comes his adaptation of Mitch Cullin's Tideland a category defying film that is at turns poetic disgusting absurd and darkly funny think the languid pacing of Spirit of the Beehive the fever dream of Alice in Wonderland the wry insanity Psycho and a large dose of Terence Malik gone insane. In many ways this is the purest Gilliam film since Brazil a film that also borrowed liberally from other sources while maintaining its own originality and hearkens back to the days when auteurs were not only allowed to follow their wildest muse but were expected to do so. And that too presents what will no doubt be Tideland's greatest failing as well as its highest achievement. Cinema has become so cynical in the last twenty years  so narrow in scope and so entertainment driven  that anything which requires viewers to experience a motion picture on its own terms is usually greeted with scorn. These would be very tough times indeed for the likes of a young Fellini Kubrick and Lynch. That's not to say Tideland is a perfectly misunderstood creation although it should be pointed out that those who are screaming foul about this film being pointless self indulgent and too weird are likely the very same people who ridiculed Grimm for being unoriginal mainstream and plain. Yes there were walkouts at its screenings gasps of shock even angry grumbling. There were also laughs applause and continued debates concerning what the film was really about how often does that occur these days after a screening?.In the end Tideland will likely please a select group who prefer to experience cinema rather than opposing it with their own expectations there were those who were still talking about it two days following its premiere even when they hated it. But for those who are anxiously wanting Time Bandits 2 or desire some degree of Pythonesque humor Tideland will disturb bore and profoundly bother to the point of contempt. Nevertheless it is a very unique and at times incredible film infused with at least two amazing performances beautiful photography and one of the most enigmatic endings I've seen in ages.Hate it or love it few will be able to deny the lingering ineffable vibrations left by this film or that it stands as further proof that its director has stayed true to himself. Of course prepare for the yinyang laments to come in spades Grimm would have been a better film had Gilliam been left to his own devices Tideland would have been a better film had Gilliam not been left to his own devices. Poor Terry Gilliam apparently he can do no right even when he does.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was very intrigued by the range of opinions about this film and I'm kind of agnostic about Gilliam at the best of times so could have gone either way. In the event it seems to me like a very personal smallscale and risky film  the kind of thing major directors don't do often enough.Gilliam introduced the screening I attended by saying that plenty of the invited audience would hate the film. He also said that its subject is the resilience of children in a world where we're encouraged to treat them as helpless victims most of the time.I was pretty much enthralled from the opening scene.

In the event it seems to me like a very personal smallscale and risky film  the kind of thing major directors don't do often enough.Gilliam introduced the screening I attended by saying that plenty of the invited audience would hate the film. He also said that its subject is the resilience of children in a world where we're encouraged to treat them as helpless victims most of the time.I was pretty much enthralled from the opening scene.

	schema:reviewBody "It's been a week since I watched Tideland though watched is hardly the best word for such a braincurdling experience. It's still on my mind so it passes my first test of A Great Film.But what's it all about? The resilience of a child? Or is it the resilience of the child within  if you want to call it that  my child within. The film was testing me and I have to admit at first I failed. The images resonate so strongly working with heroin addicts has amplified things watching a nine year old girl cooking up a hit for her father disturbs me maybe because I know how real it is all over the world. It also looks like she's had years of experience.I'm an adult and from the first scene I fear for the child a feeling that only intensifies as the story progresses. I actually looked at time twice I just wanted to get to the end right away to make it stop. I literally couldn't handle it.It was the scariest film I've seen in a long long while scarier than all the masterful Japanese horrors I can think of scarier than Hitchcock. My heart spent the whole film in my mouth which is why by the end I could taste the thing first hand becoming childlike and in those truly triumphant moments where I am falling like Alice deeper into Jeliza Rose's fantasy like when I realise she no longer mouths the doll's words they have become independent beings a triumph also of acting we will be seeing much more of the amazing Jodelle Ferland for sure or right at the end where she tells Dickens I love you and BANG! I am falling and don't even notice where I slipped or how over and over again tumbling into the void. Scary for an adult.But everything about the film is so beautiful and as I am transported further and further into Jeliza Rose's fantasy world like swimming into a beautiful painting a joyous counterpart to my fear evolves and I find myself at once incredibly disturbed and supremely hopeful as if the magic spilling out of this girl beyond all my Earthly Adult conceptions of fear and pain and misery will somehow find a way even if I can't.It's rare a film comes along that can't be faulted film without flaws but here it is called Tideland by Terry Gilliam. Screenplay cinematography acting directing for the duration of the movie I was aware of none of them disbelief completely and utterly suspended. This makes it easy to fall under its spell so be warned this film could trouble you.Looking back this last week the story just gets better and better in my mind the fantasy and reality melding into a most coherent telling of the inner life of a child and how she might deal with the most hellish scenarios that life can throw at a person. A sort of fantastical transmutation born of innocence the place where dreams are made. I think I want to read the book.And of the film I look back and I think Did she really pull that off? and I'm talking about Jodelle Ferland who is yougottafeggincheckthisout amazing at every turn playing not one but five characters  those Barbie doll heads are quite separate beings for starters. She pulls it off and then some drawing us into her dream world with the kind of magic only a young girl can get away with. If you are an actor even a gifted actor watch this at your peril if you suffer from jealousy this is gonna hurt! That's not to say that the other players only four really weren't spectacular they were and I could fill paragraphs praising their inspired exceptional performances Dickens Dell Noah even the ghastly Queen Gunhilda it's just that Jezlia Rose is the film and everyone and everything else is rightly secondary to her. And anyway it's probably best not to intellectualize acting too much I think. If you are an actor they could all make you jealous! If you are a director too Gilliam does his best work here visiting all his favourite places with a deftness that can only come from big experience not just in making films but in life. The Gods helped no doubt. Dare I call it A Masterpiece? Better not we don't want the daring Gilliam resting on his laurels! But it IS a masterpiece and one that probably only Gilliam could better if that's even possible. It's up there with all the Great Films I've been fortunate enough to have witnessed. Yes witnessed that's a better word. I was really there and you will be too. The sea is real the submarine too. I know I was there.Tideland is an astonishing piece of work and one I fully intend to enjoy on DVD as soon as possible. At least next time I won't be so scared I'm sure I'll just take a Big Deep Breath before we begin sit back for the ride and enjoy the magical beauty of it falling without snatching at the sides desperately trying to break my fall grabbing at those familiar handles spilling drawers of things all over the piece. I'll just let go and fall freely see where I land.At least as soon as I can shake the first witnessing from my head not any time soon then.fm".

But not the surroundings. Little events happening all the time make up the world. It is unclear whether they are happening inside the characters head or they are real events.

Queen Gunhilda and Noah are probably the worst parents in the history of cinema and lonely JelizaRose is a kind of a little Cinderella in this junky nest  she prepares heroin doses for her father and helps him to get high and makes foot massage for her intolerable mother. She is innocent kind and lonely child. And obviously unusual.After her mother dies from metadon overdose her father takes little girl to a little journey to the old house at the end of the world. Soon her dad is going to a long vacation and little girl is forced to live by herself in her own incredible world without any limits.Tideland is like nothing on Earth. Without any doubts this movie is a kind of magic. There is a much more of enchantment in one shot from Tideland than in the entire Chronicles of Narnia. Magic is everywhere  in slow epilepsy of the camera and in the charming music box's melodies in the indescribable locations and in the heartbreaking acting of Jodelle Ferland who plays much more than a little Alice in weird Wonderland. And I swear that I'd never forget the fireflies in the JelizaRose's eyes. Because this is a real magic.".

Noah dies in his trip and JelizaRose meets the insane Dell Janet McTeer and her retarded brother Dickens Brendan Fletcher spending most of the time together.I do not know whether Terry Gilliam was in an acid trip when he wrote the dark bizarre and insane Tideland but it is one of the craziest movies I have ever seen. However I liked the originality of the story. I could never guess the insanity of the next scene of this unpredictable film. I was also very impressed with the maturity and performance of Jodelle Ferland in her difficult lead work. This little girl is the story and it is amazing and impressive for example the sequences with JelizaRose preparing the dope of her father. The nightmarish atmosphere and the music score complete this original and unique journey to the irrational world of Terry Gilliam. My vote is seven.Title Brazil Contraponto Counterpoint".

	schema:reviewBody "On the audiocommentary track to the DVD version Terry Gilliam makes repeated reference to the film being just too daring and too different for audiences to grasp. That supposedly is why it flopped at the early screenings and was never given a proper release. Well Mr. Gilliam if you are reading this let me just say that you are deluding yourself. Your film sucks. It is the least interesting film you have ever made.I say this as a fan. I love most of Gilliam's films. His adaption of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas was deadon. This film never approaches the excellence of his best works. Or even his best misfires.Like all of his films Tideland is about the crashing together of worlds of fantasy and reality. In this case it is about how a young girl's innocence and imagination shield her from the hellish world she is thrown into by emotionally damaged adults. The point is that what we would think would be a terrify ordeal  the death of her parents her isolation in a decrepit farmhouse the antics of the bizarre Dell and Dickens  is when seen through the eyes of a young girl actually an amazing adventure maybe even the most exciting time of her life.It's a great idea unfortunately the film it inspired just doesn't work. Brief scenes of grotesque ugliness bookend a staggeringly dull seemingly endless story where basically nothing happens. No tension builds in the plot and aside from the young girl herself none of the other characters are remotely interesting. The sense of awe and whimsy a film like this needs to truly grab a viewer is simply absent.You know the film is in trouble when Gilliam tacks on a prologue where he looks directly into the camera and begs viewers to watch the film through the eyes of a child. If the film actually worked he wouldn't have to rely on such special pleading would he?".

	schema:headline " Snatched from the Jaws of Life";
	schema:reviewBody "There's no way for me to talk about this film without making it personal. I can recall the age of eight wandering around the square desert of my parents' backyard action figures in hand thinking up stories doing voices. Tideland plays to that sort of nostalgia but it balances it with a darkness visible on the horizon that cancels out whatever baser desires such nostalgia plays to. I imagine when I see the film's landscape and the househow wonderful the setting would have been to that sort of play how much such play could benefit from that setting and how lost one could get in it all. Permanently lost. The fields transforming into a sea is a great metaphor for that.Tideland is a tragedy. We the audience know or suspect that JelizaRose isn't going to turn out well after this movie's over that her imagination may be keeping her alive and marginally sane but it's out of desperation and it's clear that she understands much more of what's going on than is explicitly stated  observe her knowing looks as in the scene where Dickens leaves her alone that the little girl is going through so much for relatively little. In a way this film is about what many viewers incorrectly believe Gilliam's Brazil to be about the triumph of the imagination. But if anything in Brazil Sam Lowry's imagination is what causes the trouble to begin with and in the end is his last resort. In Tideland imagination is defeated. In the end it's like one of those horror films where the heroine survives all only to be shown walking away with the monsterkiller still behind herin her housein the backseat of the caretc. But there's an emotional resonance here that can't be found in say Halloween or A Nightmare on Elm Street because JelizaRose has no literal fate has no death but life. She returns to the real world. And I suppose that's the tragedy.This is Gilliam's most complete film since Brazil it has an emotional quality an imaginative quality and a GENUINE quality that no other Gilliam film has and which few other films period have these days cinema as it is now being so choked with irony. With Brazil we may be tempted to cry at the end if we are quick to tears but with Tideland we may be tempted to develop tears anywhere. It reminds me of Forbidden Games of Spirit of the Beehive of Truffaut's Small Change of Renoir's The River of The Wizard of Oz of Curse of the Cat People and in some ways of Ford's How Green Was My Valley. It has pedigree.Ferland's performance is nothing short of supernatural. She carries the film when it wanders or when it becomes flat out strange. She is that human voice in the wilderness.Not that there aren't some problems. The accents are fairly ridiculous all of the time and all the supporting characters are Gothic caricatures with performances to match but then this is a child's world and a child's field of vision and so I can accept these. The point is that reality doesn't much enter into it. There isn't much plot to speak of and this turns up in a few draggy sections. But this film has an absorbing quality too and I find that if I turn it on I am compelled to watch all of it.I keep thinking of Pan's Labyrinth which was so critically lauded while Tideland was so despised. PL's an okay movie but it's a cynical adult tale of childhood detached in its understanding and sort of heartless and cruel. The problem is that there is such an obvious disconnect between reality and the imaginary world. They exist separately. Of course the Spanish Civil War setting is really no more real that Ofelia's own world no less cartoonish than the world of Tideland. But it tries so hard to be harsh and gritty. It is just so difficult for me to buy Pan's Labyrinth to take it seriously OR to NOT take it seriously. Tideland is a story about a real person living in a believable or at least buyableworld. And I suspect that this is why Pan's Labyrinth is so critically lauded while Tideland is so critically despised  because it is unwilling to offend. Also where PL is unfathomably ugly Tideland is quite beautiful.Overall this may the only film of last year I can honestly say I liked that made me feel anything for it. So it's good.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having watched Terry Gilliam's Tideland just a few hours ago I sat down to write a review and find that I can't. I'm still too angry.Not at Gilliam no. I am angry because I halfdreaded turning on the movie to begin with. Critics largely reviled Tideland on its minimal American release  Rotten Tomatoes calculates its positive receptions at 27. And a fair number of online commentators even fans of the director have branded the movie as awful a mess disappointing etc. etc. So while I felt interest in Tideland I put off watching it. The reviews made me wary and I hated to see Gilliam flop. But today it came from Netflix and I thought why not and popped it in.And now I am angry  angry because I cannot believe this beautiful scary funny mesmerizing heartwrenching movie is the same one discussed in all those reviews. Have I stumbled on some unique director's cut that no one else got to see? Or have I misunderstood the purpose of movies?At the beginning of the movie Gilliam himself appears in blackandwhite like Edward Van Sloan at the beginning of Frankenstein to inform us that we may find the movie shocking but that it should be seen as through the eyes of a child  innocent. One can take this prologue either as a bold stroke or a move of desperation but either way he's right. Little Jeliza Rose played by an astounding Jodelle Ferland goes through absolute hell set adrift in a bare landscape by a heroinaddicted father Jeff Bridges. Having no protection no support no food and nothing to do she builds a new reality out of simply play.The redemption of imagination is Gilliam's Great Theme and has featured in all his movies but never I think with the depth of feeling displayed here. The camera glides and bobs and darts low to the ground a child's eye view and the tone of the movie stays true throughout without a whiff of sentimentality. Jeliza's situation is bleak and terrifying but she's occupied with other and more pressing issues  conversing with squirrels squabbling with her dolls and befriending her alarming neighbors a witchlike taxidermist and her mentally retarded brother.But she's no fool and Gilliam isn't either. The dreadful reality is always present and Jeliza knows what's what she possesses that paradoxical childhood perspective that allows a doll's head to be just a doll's head and at the same time a living person with an identity. The movie shows us the world as her imagination transforms it she spins terror and tragedy into fable.This movie staggered me it's a genuine work of art and it left me in tears. If that puts me at odds with 75 of the critical consensus I'll live with that. When I think of the endless trite garbage that these same critics routinely praise garbage that often wins awards or breaks boxoffice records comfortable and selfcongratulating hackwork that rarely has a scrap of the kind of creative courage or honesty of something like Tideland it frankly makes me question what a good movie actually IS. Do feelgood escapism and drearily unnatural naturalism really comprise the height of cinematic expression? And does the idea of being made genuinely uncomfortable by art genuinely challenged  surely art's primary function  have any current market value?In short if Tideland is not a good movie then what are movies for?".

And does the idea of being made genuinely uncomfortable by art genuinely challenged  surely art's primary function  have any current market value?In short if Tideland is not a good movie then what are movies for?";

The odds are you'll probably not like it but its at least worth trying especially if you love film. If you want to know a little bit more keep reading however my words and probably no words can do the film justice. You just have to see it.The story of JelizaRose who's father takes her to his boyhood home after her mother overdoses is a pastoral trip into the bizarre. Set on the prairie in a world like an Andrew Wyeth painting this is the interior life of a little girl who doesn't understand the world around her partly because of her age and partly because of the world she grows up in. Its a very bizarre trip thats part fantasy part comedy part horror film part tragedy part what ever else you can think of. Its unlike any Terry Gilliam movie and like the darker parts of them. Its the realism of Fisher King and the nightmare and flights of fantasy of Brazil mashed together.Its not for all audiences or even all Gilliam fans. This is a profoundly disturbing film. Its very straight forward with these tiny flashes of oddness which get longer as things go on. In its way its possibly one of the scariest movies of the year not just because of what we see on the screen but also because of how it echoes out to our own lives and how we see the world being just as cockeyed we are all in our own fantasy worlds.How JelizaRose sees the world is in its way the same way we all do. Its a scary thought.Forgive me for not being more specific this is a film that needs to hit you with out expectations and without preconceived notions so the less you know the better it is.I liked the film a great deal even though it made me feel really uneasy. Possibly one of the best films of the year certainly one of the best Terry Gilliam movies this movie demands to be seen by serious film lovers and those with an open mind.".

With each subsequent release he has given us less and less to think about and ponder. Instead his projects have become increasingly vainmaking films only he will enjoy not us his fans.Tideland is better than the insufferable Brothers Grimm but not much better in terms of being entertaining. I was completely suspicious at the beginning of my DVD seeing Gilliam himself explaining what the film was going to be about. Why? He's never had to do that before. Perhaps it was due to the poor reception of Brothers Grimm? Brazil didn't have a disclaimer at the beginning.The main disappointment about Tideland is that I found it tedious. The story was not interesting much like Brothers Grimm and Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas. Boring comes to mind. Did Gilliam really think that a child actress would carry an entire film? I think she did a great job but still.....that's all there was. The story didn't really go anywhere. I wasn't shocked by a single thing in this film so I don't know what the big deal was that other reviews are so titillated by. I've seen far worse in films. Jeff Bridges is great but the story doesn't involve much of him. It's mainly about this little girl who has been emotionally abused and neglected by her parents and how she copes with it. Gilliam doesn't give us anything to think about thoughthe story just is.I sure hope Gilliam gets back on track some day. He had a string of solid films like Time Bandits Brazil Baron Munchausen Fisher King and 12 Monkeys. You've had your fun Mr. Gilliam now it's time to give your audience what they want.".

	schema:headline " A Trip Down The Rabbit Hole";
	schema:reviewBody "I went to see Tideland with absolutely no idea what the movie was about except that it was directed by Terry Gilliam. Seeing that the main character was a little girl I thought I was about to see something along the lines of Gilliam's The Adventures of Baron Munchausen or Time Bandits  a zany imaginative fantasy adventure told from the point of view of a child. Well it was zany  trippy would be more apt  and it sure was an adventure but I still obviously had no idea what kind of rabbit hole I was about to fall into.JelizaRose the amazing Jodelle Ferland is the playful daughter of a junkie couple played by Jeff Bridges and Jennifer Tilly. When her mother dies JelizaRose's deranged father takes his daughter to the now deserted house he grew up in where the imaginative lonely little girl explores the rundown house and the barren land around her with innocence only a child can possess. Accompanied by the four illtreated remains of dolls she has for friends JelizaRose eventually gets familiar with her only neighbours  the strange sinister lady by the name of Dell and lobotomized brother  and manages to keep herself happy and entertained through makebelief and imagination.If there ever was a movie that should be restricted from adults because of its disturbing content Tideland would be it. A child as innocent as JelizaRose could watch this film without being constantly scared that something awful is going to happen to her unable to see all the neglect and threatening situations she's exposed to. JelizaRose is a happy little girl but she lives in conditions no child should have to live in. Her world is full of dangers noone will protect her from yet the girl doesn't even realize this herself being so estranged from normal life. That's Tideland it's sheer everyday horror filtered through the eyes of a child who is just too innocent to be afraid.Innocence however is also a bliss for Tideland's curious little heroine. Her innocence and her vivid imagination keep her happy when terrible things happen. This is the comforting side of the story even in the worst possible conditions imagination gives children the strength to survive.The role of JelizaRose is played by the superb Jodelle Ferland who carries the weight of the entire movie on her tiny shoulders. Not only does she give a compelling portrayal of the constantly rambling heroine she also provides the voices of JelizaRose's friends  the four doll heads she carries around with her. There are various scenes that consist mostly of dialogue between the girl and her dolls and sometimes it's just very difficult to comprehend that every word is spoken by an actress who has barely hit the double digits. Her performance is simply amazing. I've never seen a better child actress in a leading role.I'm sure Tideland will always be a controversial movie. I'm sure that a lot of people will find it too disturbing even disgusting. I did  I loved it but it felt terrible to watch. I'm not sure if I want to see it again because it's so heavy and affecting and it really tests the nerves of anyone with the natural urge to protect children. Because of this Tideland is a powerful movie I continue to praise. I'm not sure if I'd recommend it to everyone because I know a lot of people would hate it but it's still definitely worth a watch for Jodelle Ferland's amazing performance alone.".

	schema:reviewBody "Any film that starts out with a defensive disclaimer from the director explaining to the viewer how the film should be viewed is immediately suspect to me. It implies that what I am about to see wasn't done right and the director needs to do a lot of backtracking to make it seem like the whole thing was on purpose.And that is exactly how Tideland unfolded.Though sold as bold cinema for those who aren't happy to be placated by Hollywood junk Tideland is nothing of the sort. It's a pretentious folly  it tries so hard to shock that it comes off like an old John Waters film without the youthful snickering and it seems to think that if you wrap it all in very forced allusions to Alice in Wonderland you've got yourself some art.The first problem with the film is Gilliam's assertion that it is a testament to the resilience of children. The ending implies that adversity is bludgeoned from the soul with the right amount of imagination but the whole film is populated with horrible adults who were not resilient children in the slightest  they are damaged broken people lashing out. There is no resilience on display anywhere  and even the ending doesn't reveal resilience so much as dumb luck.Furthermore Gilliam's proposition is an eitheror one a simplistic proclamation of a complicated circumstance. Surviving does not mean wholeness as Gilliam's rosecolored glasses ending implies. There are degrees upon degrees of subtle trauma that such survival entails  surely the topic deserves more than his standard theme of people retreating into their imagination in order to survive in the world they find themselves. It's the same story for every movie the man has made and it feels incredibly tacked on in this one.The second problem is that Gillliam populates the film with cartoon characters that don't elicit any real sympathy or horror. I understand that he is trying to do the fairy tale schtick but it doesn't work because the moral he is pushing is so flawed that it needs nuance more than archetypes to address the real thematic concerns that can come out of this story. Jeff Bridges and Jennifer Tilly aren't particularly menacing they're just goofy. They seem like Hollywood actors pretending to be campedup degenerates. They are like something out of the Batman TV show.The third problem is the lead actress who just hasn't got what it takes to carry a whole film particularly one that spends A LOT of time with just her talking to herself. She seems so directed so controlled by what Gilliam wants her to do that there is nothing natural in her performance at all  she is more like Gilliam's idea of what a child acts like rather than a real person  and the portrayal of this character is so grating between the actress' limitations and Gilliam's inept conception of her that she brings no sympathy to a character who should demand much.The fourth problem is that it is long and boring. A good half hour needs to be cut out just to stop the meandering. The supposed shocking nature of the film comes off as the desperate attempt of an old director to prove he still has his edge  it's not jarring so much a comainducing. And that's the saddest part. For all the implications of the disclaimer at the end it actually doesn't deliver in its promised provocation and it becomes obvious that it just never occurred to Gilliam that the reason some people didn't like it isn't because it's scandalous or because they don't understand what he was trying to do but because he just didn't do it very well at any stage of the production.I respect him for trying something different but the nature of an experiment is that the chance exists that it might fail and anyone with any real grip on the creative journey needs to accept that and be able to examine what went wrong rather than be defensive about it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Walking out of the theater with my friends having seen Tideland helped things as we were able to talk about all the thoughtsemotions that we had regarding the movie. And what a film this is. We were all rather speechless seeing a filmmaker at work at either his best his worst or both. Terry Gilliam's Tideland puts other mindbenders to shame. The film conjures up so much in the viewer and it really is when it all comes down to it attempting chiefly to put the viewer most likely an adult it's quite worthy of it's R rating into the viewpoint intuition imagination and needed escapism of a 9 year old girl. And quite the uh unique nine year old girl at that. JelizaRose Jodelle Ferland lives a life that is surrounded in the reality of it at least by depravity despair and a kind of very weird disturbing neglect. Her parents Jeff Bridges and Jennifer Tilly are both heroin addicts the latter of which overdoses on methadone. In shock the father takes JelizaRose off to the farmhouse he grew up in. Jeliza soon settles in very comfortably it seems into a house that is near dilapidated with her doll's heads as her best companions and critics and followers and of course imaginative voices for herself and finds a friend in Dickens Brendan Fletcher as the two of them share a strong delirious connection.Meanwhile as Gilliam uses Bridges's character's fate practically as a plot device he also does something with the flow and direction of the story of what's there anyway that reminded me a little of Gondry's the Science of Sleep. This is really all a very subjectively done movie and if the viewer can get into that subjective realm of the central character where fantasy and reality become blurred and pretty much one in the same then the main chord of the film is struck into. It's understandable too after leaving the film how some people and some of those being the critics in the press would hate the film so much. In fact this may be the most polarizing movie Gilliam has ever made and even I at times wondered if Gilliam could go too far with the material and he sometimes steps onto that line of decency even in the subversive tragiccomicfantasy realm a little much.There is much to be disturbed from in this film and it may rank up there with the most disturbing works of pure absurdism or surrealism take your pick of the past decade. Take the fate of Noah he has that chair he sits in I will try not to reveal too much and then after a while when this changes around the effect this has on the audience is definitely a lot more horrific than it is for his daughter who merely faints at one point though quite a point. But this same terror that can come from seeing things in the innocent naive perspective of a child can also bring some interesting things too and some of the more gruesome elements get mixed together with the other sweeter bits. There's one set of images that will stick with me for a while where the doll heads are performing some kind of 'experiment' inside of I'm not kidding Noah's insides. This visual imagination is expanded upon even further than in past Gilliam films which include a submersion in some kind of water as Jeliza swims about a 'trip' down the rabbit hole moments of talk with a squirrel and the issue with that darn train or rather 'shark'.A lot of this seemingly would be so traumatic on a child at least in terms of how being 'left alone' here is really not a joke exactly and I often wondered how Gilliam directed Ferland through a lot of this. Maybe part of it was Ferland using her own imagination and more crucially innocence and always being truthful to that terminally dysfunctional but never boring state of mind she's in. Nothing is of the ordinary for her and Ferland plays JelizaRose in one of the best turns by a child actor I've seen in quite a while. Compared other characters in fact maybe to everyone particularly Dickens's Fletcher and Janet McTeer's Dell she's got all of her marbles together. But maybe not. Maybe her whole outlook is all based around being set inside this world where unliving things are very much alive. After a while I understood all too well why a child would have to be in this outlook and state of mind any sense of going past the abstractions would make things too horrible to contemplate.So would I recommend the movie hmm...I still need to think about that I think. I'm basically now still brooding over the images and themes and ideas and just the general tone of the picture. To say this about any Gilliam film might be moot considering his track record but Tideland is really nothing like any other film you've seen before. I was sometimes left in my seat saying 'oh my God' as well as getting very big and small laughs from how far Gilliam pushes things even sometimes just with his camera via Nicola Pecorini's lens. He asks the viewer to try and take in the characters and the moods and sights and sounds and turns of events like a child who had no other portal of what's ordinary and regular and common to cling onto. From what's around JelizaRose death addiction decay and nothingness to a degree the more she has to latch into her own point of view. It's one of the most affecting films of the year and at the least I think after a first viewing it won't leave you feeling indifferent.".

	schema:headline " Helm's great screenplay and Ferrell's astonishing acting make for an excellent film";
	schema:reviewBody "I liked the idea of Stranger than Fiction from the start. And I still like the idea after having seen the film. I was not a big fan of all the huge press firsttime screenwriter Zach Helm was getting but in comparison to the ballooning publicity with Sascha Baron Cohen and Borat! it was not too bad. I continually looked forward to seeing the film and am glad that the great trailer did not reveal everything like I had originally assumed.The film involves Harold Crick Will Ferrell an IRS agent who lives his life by a very strict routine. One day he wakes up and begins to hear a woman narrating all of his actions. Suspicious Crick continues attempting to live his life out but after an inexplicable comment in regards to his immenent death he goes on the hunt for the voice. Randomly spliced into Crick's search is Karen Eiffel Emma Thompson. She is writing a novel about a character named Harold Crick and is unknowingly the voice Crick keeps hearing. She is battling a case of writer's block and spends much of the film attempting to come up with the finale for the character.Unlike many other existential comedies Fiction is sweet and almost innocent in its design. Yes the main focus of the film is pretty grim but the lifealtering questions that keep going around during the film do not become anywhere near as depressing and bizarre as those found in the likes of the work of Charlie Kaufman. In a way Fiction feels a lot like a Kaufmanwritten film but lacking in the means of being totally out there almost like being a decaf as opposed to a regular. As a result while being an excellent film albeit slightly predictable it cannot break past the mold already set by the likes of the absolutely brilliant Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. It just feels like it is missing that spark that could have sprung it right into the brilliance that all films like this strive for.Going along with the story itself it feels a little illpaced in some few instances but for the most part sucks you right in and keeps you there. It has many comedic elements and has some great dramatic sequences as well. They all play well and while I still would not give him a ton of credit I was very impressed by Helm's firsttime effort. His writing feels vibrant and fresh and in a film industry with absolutely little originality or thought it is just great that movies like this slip through and get greenlighted. Every piece of dialogue and background feels well expressed and just play out astonishingly well. On the topic of Crick however I liked the idea of how neurotic and obsessive Crick was over numbers but I thought it was a bit of an overkill to include special effect shots showing the numbers being counted within his head. It felt silly in The Da Vinci Code so why did Sony feel the need to add it here too? On that note much like my being impressed by Adam Sandler from time to time Ferrell really pulls through here and does give the best performance of his short career. The psychological trauma that his character goes through is evident in his facial and body emotions and the way he conveys it on screen is nowhere near what I would have expected. He brings an amazing sense of what this character is really about and gives him a poignancy that makes him so lifelike that it becomes almost too great to explain. This is a pathetically sad man who you cannot help but pull for as the film goes on. And for all the right reason too. He may deliver some of the funniest lines in the movie but he is totally mature and at ease in this role. Thankfully this means that he stays serious for the most part throughout the film and does not let any Ricky Bobby or Ron Bergundy slip out. He could have easily blown it but thankfully manages to stay in check.Thompson is another particular standout especially in contrast to Ferrell. She is broken and weak searching for the perfect ending. The pain and sorrow that goes through her face as she writes and thinks has a poetic excellence to it and she only continues to prove how good of an actor she is. Dustin Hoffman and Queen Latifah work well in supporting roles supporting Ferrell and Thompson respectively as the film progresses on. Hoffman has always had great comedic timing and he does not let it go to waste here. He plays right off of Ferrell in grand ways and just feels totally at home in the role. Latifah while not in the film so much is very good in her bit parts. Maggie Gyllenhaal also shines here and clearly has the makings for an Oscar sometime in the late future.For its small problems Fiction still is able to prove its worth and is clearly one of the best films of the year. It will be able to stand proud among the other entries in the existential comedy genre or just stand proud on its own. Helm's screenplay coupled in with an intoxicatingly great performance by Ferrell make for a great trip to the movies. And sure beats some of the crap that's been released over the past few weeks.910.".

Imagine a Charlie Kaufman penned film where all the cynicism and nihilism is replaced with an endearing and heartfelt melancholy that creates a surprising amount of emotional involvement in characters who would've otherwise been overreaching literacy devices and you'll get a feel for the sincere type of entertainment Marc Forster's film provides.Forster with his keen eye and eclectic visual sense populates the film the sharp and contrasting visual angles camera tricks and inframe oddities like the play with numbers constantly keeping the viewer engaged and on their toes. Fun supporting turns from Dustin Hoffman as a literary theorist employed by Krick to help find out if the story he is in is a comedy or tragedy and Queen Latifah as Eiffel's nononsense publishing assistant help guide the viewers through imaginative stretches that are occasionally too clever by half. Ferrel gets to show some nice range here and much like Robin Williams did with The World According to Garp and Jim Carrey did with The Truman Show graduates with honors into more highminded quasiserious roles. His colead Thompson is subtly method and well studied as the reclusive sociopathic author who just can't help killing her characters.What really seals the deal is Maggie Gyllenhal as Farrell's love interest the antiestablishment baker he is assigned to audit. She literally lights up the screen. There's one expertly framed and perfectly lit shot of her standing outside her townhouse inviting Farrel in for the night where the light from street lamp off screen is filtered in through the shadows of tree branches and hits her face in such a way that in that brief flickering frame you become insanely happy to be watching such a pleasant marriage of literary concepts inside a visual medium. At this point you don't care how the film ends. You're just grateful to experience that giddy moment of pure movie entertainment.".

Ferrel gets to show some nice range here and much like Robin Williams did with The World According to Garp and Jim Carrey did with The Truman Show graduates with honors into more highminded quasiserious roles. His colead Thompson is subtly method and well studied as the reclusive sociopathic author who just can't help killing her characters.What really seals the deal is Maggie Gyllenhal as Farrell's love interest the antiestablishment baker he is assigned to audit. She literally lights up the screen. There's one expertly framed and perfectly lit shot of her standing outside her townhouse inviting Farrel in for the night where the light from street lamp off screen is filtered in through the shadows of tree branches and hits her face in such a way that in that brief flickering frame you become insanely happy to be watching such a pleasant marriage of literary concepts inside a visual medium. At this point you don't care how the film ends. You're just grateful to experience that giddy moment of pure movie entertainment.";

Maggie Gyllenhaal is a delight. Emma Thompson is brilliant as always. Simply wonderful! The writing was terrific. It was so nice to see a movie that could make you laugh and think not too hard at the same time. Direction was well done as well  it was even visually appropriate.Go see it and take a friend.

Even knowing when or how you will die not such a fatuous idea with the completion of the Genome Project raises difficult questions about how much we really want to know about ourselves.Such a theme is usually simplified and subsumed into religiousbased tales such as It's a Wonderful Life but taken as an idea in its own right it has considerable intellectual weight. Harold Crick finds himself the main character in a story as it unfolds but his annoyance quickly shifts gear as he is aware of the author saying Little did he know . . . it would lead to his imminent death.Not the mindless comedy that the trailer suggests Stranger Than Fiction is a precise and fairly cerebral story where the laughs stem more from individually appreciating certain aspects of its cleverness rather than any contrived humour. The surface story is of a man who lives a humdrum if 'successful' life and is awakened to a more three dimensional existence by falling in love. The additional elements will either delight or annoy. IRS auditor Crick Will Ferrell starts hearing a voice in his head. It is that of Kay Eiffel Emma Thompson a famous author. She describes exactly what he is doing but with a rather better vocabulary than he possesses. When she announces his imminent death he takes drastic steps to meet her and persuade her to change the ending of her novel.The characterisation casting and acting is spoton. Thompson is at her most refreshingly deranged as the harassed and reclusive author. With a literary equivalence of method acting Eiffel balances on the edge of her desk trying to imagine the thoughts of someone about to make a suicide jump. She sits in the freezing drizzle watching cars cross a bridge to imagine an accident. Her rants at her 'editorial assistant' who uses more traditional methods of accessing imagination give a convincing insight into the creative process. While the voice in Crick's head is stereotypical Thompson the fuller isolated character when we meet her is a minor revelation. I don't need a nicotine patch she declaims angrily to her assistant. I smoke cigarettes.Maggie Gyllenhaal as law dropout turned baker Ana Pascal sparkles glows and is sexily alluring and radiant with passionate love of life  and she manages to light up the screen faster than say even Juliette Binoche in Chocolat. Dustin Hoffman has the least challenging of the main parts but he endows his character an eminent professor of literature with the gravitas needed to take ideas of literary interconnectedness seriously. Will Ferrell gives a remarkable breakout performance in a straight role reminiscent of Jim Carrey in The Truman Show. He is superbly suited to the part as audiences expect him to be a shallow comedy character and here he is trying the find the substantial person inside himself. Most of the audience are concentrating so much on the film's intricate hypothesis and how it is worked out that only afterwards do we realise what a range of emotions Ferrell has to portray with complete seriousness.Novelist Kay Eiffel Thompson anthropomorphises things like Crick's watch similarly the official website says in real time As the cursor waited anxiously for the site to load it couldn't help but feel an overwhelming sense of elation. We sense a lifeimbuing process that might even be likened to what an actor does with his character but the film goes a stage further by drawing a similarity with the essentially lifeless clockwork existence of the IRS auditor whose only escape is discovering love with Pascal. His quest is aided by fictional plot analysis from Professor Jules Hilbert Dustin Hoffman and of course begs the question what is fiction?Director Marc Forster showed consummate skill in portraying the positive escapism of JM Barrie's creative PeterPanwriting in Finding Neverland. With Stranger Than Fiction he has teamed up with brilliant new dramatist Zach Helm. Helm is fascinated with the writing process in what he calls a larger PostModern movement. From Pirandello to Brecht to Wilder to Stoppard to Woody Allen to Wes Anderson we can see the progression of a contemporary selfaware realitybending and audienceinvolving wave in dramatic literature he says. I love to see Homer Simpson reacting to his creator Matt Groenig or the cast of 'Urinetown' complaining from the stage about their own title.Even the street names business names and the characters' last names of Stranger Than Fiction are significant  Crick Pascal Eiffel Escher Banneker Kronecker Cayly etc. are all puns on mathematicians who focused on the innate order of things. The invitation is to ask what is beyond the symmetry of things. Stranger Than Fiction meets even its most formidable challenge  making the ending nailbiting and moving after such surreal content. But the ultimate message of the film seems a little trite if it is supposedly coming from a groundbreaking author. Like the glimpses of Eiffel's book we are given impressive mountains of style but little substance. As the film doesn't press the strengths forcefully by admitting in so many words what it is getting at there is a chance you may not bother with the subtleties  in which case it adds up to very little.A superb testament to inventiveness and worthy of awards in many different categories Stranger Than Fiction somehow falls short of being a masterpiece.".

	schema:reviewBody "Stranger Than Fiction is a quirky black comedy about Harold Crick an average man with a fascination and preoccupation for numbers who discovers that he is apparently little more than a character in someone else's story and that the course of his life appears to have been scripted. Everything he does and thinks is narrated as he does and thinks it so after the realisation that he's not actually going mad he tries to find out what is really going on.I liked this film a lot  it had elements of similarly themed films where fictional worlds intersect and influence the real world and vice versa such as The Hours and The Purple Rose Of Cairo. Yet it takes this concept in a new direction and touches on the philosophies of choice and fate  if the story of our lives is already written can we change the script? Does knowing what the future holds influence our lives or are we just following a predestined course whatever we do? As you might expect Marc Foster gives good and capable direction and there are lots of elements of the film that were really very enjoyable. Some scenes are maybe drawn out too long but for the most part he manages to keep the film flowing smoothly. The 'mathematical images' which beautifully illustrate the clockwork mind of Harold Crick are a great idea and reminiscent of the Ikea scene from Fight Club.The acting on the whole was of an excellent standard. Will Ferrell's dry delivery was absolutely perfect for the role of a man with his fate in the hands of a seemingly unknown force. Maggie Gyllenhaal Dustin Hoffman and Queen Latifah all give very respectable performances as does the relatively unknown Tony Hale. Yet I felt that the gem in this film had to be Emma Thompson's performance as the neurotic and fidgety author Kay Eiffel who seems to become increasingly unstrung as the film progresses.I was lucky enough to get to see a test screening of this film tonight. I was expecting a generic Hollywood romantic comedy yet the storyline was sufficiently quirky and engaging and performances were superb giving it a rightful place alongside other great modern black comedies.".

It is with this notion that Stranger than FictionFerrell's first major foray into a theatrical world outside the realm of inyourface frat boy sillinessjust makes sense. By surrounding Ferrell's charisma with a subdued darkly comic script and a talented supporting cast we get a film that is both fresh and heartfelt.

Number crunching IRS agent and genuine loser Harold Crick Ferrell one day wakes up to find his life being narrated word for word by burnt out writer Karen Eiffel Emma Thompson. Odd thing is Eiffel is writing an actual book where Crick just happens to be the main character. To make matters worse she plans on killing him off as soon as she can make it through a particularly arduous stretch of writer's block.Originality is one thing that is absent from a majority of contemporary Hollywood pictures so Fiction immediately gets points for simply trying something different. I suppose it's icing on the cake that the film is genuinely good. Crick knowing that is death is imminent begins to break out of his cloistered shell and to experience the fruits of his life. And in the process he forms a bond with a tax breaking baker Gyllenhal and seeks advice from a literature professor played by a particularly charming Dustin Hoffman However even though it is well intentioned the execution isn't flawless. The romance that develops between Gyllenhal's outcast baker and Ferrell's straitlaced Crick doesn't feel entirely organic. We admire the relationship and smile at its sugar coated sweetness but we don't necessarily believe their connection. It may taste good but it doesn't exactly wash down smoothly. Neither does the film's over reliance on reinforcing generic Carpe Diem philosophies. Towards the second act things do get sappy. Luckily by the conclusion the plot has bounced back to a wonderful limbo of both oddly comic and genuinely heartwarming moments.For all its flaws Stranger than Fiction works. Like a good novel Forster has fashioned something that is strange stylistic and unexpectedly inspiring. And despite the chinks in its existentialist armor that's surely something worth writing home about.".

He's not bad by any means but he just doesn't work at the same level as the rest of the cast. Kudos to him for what he DOES accomplish in this film but it would've had plenty of starpower without him and the role could've been used to showcase someone else's talent.All in all thumbs up.Just my two cents.".

Kudos to him for what he DOES accomplish in this film but it would've had plenty of starpower without him and the role could've been used to showcase someone else's talent.All in all thumbs up.Just my two cents.";

Harold Crick Will Ferrell is a nondescript IRS agent who awakes one day to hear a woman narrating much of his life. Unbeknownst to him at the time the voice belongs to a wellknown author who routinely kills her main characters in her novels. No big deal except for the fact that he soon learns of his fate. That of course horrifies him and he spends the majority of the film coping with that inevitability.Unfortunately the lofty possibilities raised by such a fantastically original idea are never fully explored. Stranger doesn't take the time to delve into the lifeanddeath complexities that could arise from a man searching for the why and who behind his future demise. Nor does it address most of the unique moral questions and obligations that would arise. Instead the script settles for clichs like a typically rushed cinematic romance premises that aren't all that bad but are more suited to be side stories not main arcs. These shortcomings glaringly keep Stranger from reaching the Oscarwinning level of something like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind or other Charlie Kaufman work. In fact this movie might be best described as Diet Charlie Kaufman a pop psychological movie a thinking movie for those who don't really want to think.As Adam Sandler did for PunchDrunk Love Will Ferrell will no doubt receive heaps of praise for his portrayal of IRS agent Harold Crick. Make no mistake Ferrell is fine but don't let anyone convince you this is an Oscarworthy turn. The simple fact that he plays it straight without getting nearly naked or overreacting doesn't automatically create a great performance. The reality is that while he has his moments Ferrell is the straight man in this picture a tepid character who contrasts well with Maggie Gyllenhaal's anarchist baker Anna Dustin Hoffman's Yoda of literature professor and Emma Thompson's work as author Kay Eiffel which results in the best performance in the film. She lends the part a wackiness that seems genuinely fresh in odd unteachable ways like how she touches both sides of a door frame when passing. She acts crazy enough but not so crazy that you sense the acting as she neurotically haggles over how she can kill off her protagonist.In the end Stranger Than Fiction is like Anna's cookies. They both taste good at the time as the movie does have its humorous and entertaining moments but their long term value is limited due to their lack of nutrition. Nothing here is going to linger but if you're interested you won't be sorry you saw it.Bottom Line A missed opportunity but still worth a rental or cheap theater ticket. 6 of 10.".

I commented that the trap to avoid here would be the hero discovers how meaningless his life is and undergoes a transformation into a new more interesting person clich if the filmmakers could avoid that and give us some original character development we might just have a great film.I'm disappointed to report that they did not avoid that trap. True the transformation wasn't quite as overthetop as it is in some films but it did rely heavily on evergreater interaction with the love interest a more casual wardrobe a hip song performance and a handful of other overused vehicles that scream Look at me!

	schema:reviewBody "Marc Forster is making a name for himself with such major films as Monsters Ball and Finding Neverland. In Stranger Than Fiction he takes a plot that could have been suggested by Charlie Kaufman Being John Malkovich Adaptation and creates a world that suggests fantasy yet is grounded in what we call reality. It is an inventive plot made convincing by sensitive direction and fine performances by its stars Will Ferrell and Maggie Gyllenhaal. IRS civil servant Harold Crick Ferrell leads a regimented mundane existence which consists of an orderly routine guided by his punctual wristwatch.

	onyx:emotionText "Marc Forster is making a name for himself with such major films as Monsters Ball and Finding Neverland. In Stranger Than Fiction he takes a plot that could have been suggested by Charlie Kaufman Being John Malkovich Adaptation and creates a world that suggests fantasy yet is grounded in what we call reality. It is an inventive plot made convincing by sensitive direction and fine performances by its stars Will Ferrell and Maggie Gyllenhaal. IRS civil servant Harold Crick Ferrell leads a regimented mundane existence which consists of an orderly routine guided by his punctual wristwatch. His solitary life becomes upset by the presence of a female voice that seems to be narrating his every move. His daily rituals are altered and when he audits a baker a free spirited activist named Ana Pascal Gyllenhaal he meets stiff resistance and hostility. Compelled to find the answers to the mysterious voice he first consults the company shrink Tom Hulce in a welcome yet short performance a therapist Linda Hunt in too brief a role and finally a literary professor Dr. Jules Hilbert Dustin Hoffman in bravura support.

	schema:reviewBody "What an imaginative and touching story! Marc Forster's Stranger Than Fiction written by Zach Snyder is a movie that could have failed in so many aspects despite its creative premise yet the story confidently moved forward punctuated by clever poignant and thoughtstirring twists.And Will Ferrell's performance is integral to the film's success because he plays a nuanced and extremely restrained character who contradicts the very comical premise of the film as soon as we think this is going to be a fantasyfarce. This is even more pleasantly surprising as Ferrell is like the Bill Murray of his generation a SNL alumni used to madcap comedies where he plays eccentric and onelinersthrowing characters. Here he is Harold Crick a meek and discreet IRS agent who lives under a steady routine guided by an electronic wristwatch.The opening voiceover narration insists that nothing special ever happened to Harold Crick... for the simple reason that he's the one controlling his life and saw no reason whatsoever to make this change. He's no Truman Burbank or Fight Club Narrator he likes the minimalist scope he gave to his life for twelve years from his Spartan house to his bythebook ethics. But who said we've got to make our own existential crisis? One day a voice starts narrating Crick's thought as he's brushing his teeth there's something literary in the disembodied female voice he hears Cricks stops brushing his teeth starts again and then the voice describes his feeling at that point. We get it it's the story of a character who hears the narrator and this premise is exciting enough.But there are reasons I mentioned Bill Murray or Jim Carrey in this review Stranger Than Fiction feels like one of these clever concept movies Groundhog Day or The Truman Show but Ferrell plays the protagonist differently than Bill Murray as Phil Connors and even Jim Carrey managed to be comical at times like giving a wink to the audience who needed at least one funny grin. Ferrell doesn't surrender to comedy no matter how comedic his situation gets he plays his character as if something serious like an illness was happening. And this is a revelation a proof that any actor given the right story and direction can go beyond the preconceived limits of his acting range. Adam Sandler gave me a similar impression in Click but the film wasn't as consistently good.Stranger Than Fiction never takes its originality for granted. The narration is only the starting point we only hear it during crucial times and it starts being a problem when the narrator is revealed to be omniscient and explains that a simple act Crick just committed will lead to his imminent death. It is not the word 'death' that provokes a sudden outburst of angst but 'imminent' tragedy material. When a voice that knows everything about you or your most hidden thoughts tells you that you're going to die well even the most Cartesian and sensible man will be likely to believe it.Crick goes to a psychiatrist played by Linda Hunt she diagnoses a case of schizophrenia but suggests him to ask a literature professor. Within the twisted premise of the story this is implacably logical so Crick goes to Pr. Hilbert played by Dustin Hoffman. Detached and rational Hilbert gives him homework. Crick must determine whether he is a comedic or tragic character one that is governed by the continuity of life or the inevitability of death. Crick must test whether he controls his storyline or not like a tragic character and then tries to do whatever he wants if his death is so inevitable. At that point we already forgot about the narrator and the film gets closer in themes and tone to Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman's masterpieces.Indeed Stranger Than Fiction made me realize why selfreferential movies are so fascinating they have something inherently human behind entertaining plots. And the core of the story is the sweet romance between Crick and a freespirited tattooed taxrebel baker played by Maggie Gylenhall. When he starts auditing her you feel the attraction but he can't reach her heart because he's stuck up to his job and it takes time for him to finally allow her to reach him. The chemistry feels real as there's something authentic in their performances Ana loves what she does and Harold governed by the necessity to give a meaning to his seemingly meaningless life starts doing what he loves playing guitar developing friendship pleasing himself.Ultimately Ana falls in love with him and Crick thinks he might be in a comedy until he finally sees the face behind the voice it's author Karen Eiffel Emma Thompson who seems to be the one pulling the strings. The trick is that she always kills off her lead characters and the trickiest part is that Crick's life is only depending on whether she decides to kill him off or not. She shares her mental block with her editor's employee Queen Latifah wondering about the perfect way to kill Crick until she realizes that he exists. The film escalates to the level of mindbending genius a word that has been so overused for the likes of Inception when she gives Crick the manuscript. Hilbert reads it and considers it a masterpiece with his death being part of that greatness. And Crick reads it and agrees.It all comes down to a simple question should one die just because it makes a terrific ending? This is one of the greatest narrative tricks ever pulled on screen and an existential lesson. Crick gave his meaningless life a meaning wasn't he laughing at The Meaning of Life in the theater?. Maybe life can be less flashy than its dramatized version yet as 'disappointing' as the ending was storywise it was deeply moving and touching in the way we connected it to our reality and a little bit to fiction.".

	schema:reviewBody "Most times I find it interesting to watch a comedian pay a dramatic role. Here will Ferrell plays an extremely straight lowkey character an IRS agent who is part of a as strange story. Yes the title to this movie is 100 percent accurate Stranger Than Fiction really describes this bizarre tale of a man whose life is being lived out as a writer of fiction stories types it up. In other words the fiction writer's main character is a reallife guy.Emma Thompson comes out of semiretirement to play the role of Karen Eiffel a writer whose novels always end up with the hero getting killed. Also she narrates the story to the lead character who is the only one who can actually hear her voice. Slowly as the story unravels her latest subject a Harold Crick Farrell discovers what is going on and tries to get her to change the ending! Along the way in a secondary part of the film the romance angle Crick becomes involved with the unlikeliest of women Asa Pascal Maggie Gyllenhall.Crick also makes a new friend who is an expert on authors. He seeks him out because that guy Professor Jules Hilbert Dustin Hoffman is the one who helps him discover whom the author is the person who plans to kill him off. It's not easy to explain all of this in a handful of sentences written off the cuff. Sorry.This all may sound like a suspenseful thriller but it isn't. It's a humaninterest story which could have many interpretations. I read a few long reviews not here on this movie afterward and got two very diverse viewpoints one with religious overtones and other totally secular. I didn't read anything into this except it being an interesting and original screenplay and well acted.Ferrell was outstanding in his performance. I'm not really a fan of his irreverent comedies but I was very impressed with him in this movie. The only unlikable character was Thompson's but she comes around with a nice touch near the end.If you are looking for something different and something to get your brain working a little bit this is recommended. For those expecting the normal Will Ferrell wackiness stay away it's hardly that. I hate to use the clich phrase thoughtprovoking but I think it applies here.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is billed as a comedy in trailers and it's choice of cast supports this idea. The fact is this movie is one of the most tear jerking movies I have ever seen.This movie starts out with a humorous tone similar to READING Hitchhiker's Guide to the Gallaxy and slowly you start to feel for the main characters and understand how sad they are. Unlike a great deal of movies that are sad this one does not deliver a punch at the end to get the viewers crying. It starts much earlier.I spent most of my time fighting off tears while watching this movie but I could not tear myself away. It took me a bit to recover after the end and all I could say is Wow.The casting for this movie could not have been any better. Will Ferrell Maggie Gyllenhaal Dustin Hoffman Queen Latifah and Emma Thompson all delivered some of the best acting seen for years. Will Ferrell in particular has followed many comedy actors like Robin Williams and proves that he is more than a slapstick joker.This movie needs some awards big time. I personally would give this Best actor  Will Ferrel and Best Screenplay.".

It helps he decided to tackle the amazing screen play that Zach Helm wrote for this project. Both men show to compliment one another in a winning film that unfortunately suffered at the box office. It's hard to imagine how the movie didn't attract more people because it deserves a viewing from anyone that considers to be a cinema fan. Part of the blame seems to be the perception that the lead actor Will Farrell was expected to deliver a character that was funny like most of the ones he had given in other vehicles.Harold Crick is a man so meticulous he even counts the brush strokes he applies to his teeth every time he cleans them. He seems to be the right person for an IRS inspector. He is a joyless man whose life is numbers and audits. He has an incredible mind for multiplication and yet why is his life the mess it is? When Harold begins hearing the voice that seems to be narrating his life he unravels. Harold decides to consult experts to try to help him getting to the bottom of what he is experiencing. Alas the professionals he consults never can give him an answer. It's only when he stumbles into a university professor who upon hearing a phrase Harold has heard in his mind to interest Prof. Hilbert to come to aid him.It is at this time that one gets to realize that Harold Crick is a character out of the fiction of a reclusive writer Karen Eiffel a woman whose distinction is the ability to kill all her main characters in the novels she writes. The problem is that Karen is suffering from an acute problem of writer's block. In fact she doesn't know how to kill this Harold Crick who becomes her obsession. Karen Eiffel's life is a mess. Not even when Penny Escher comes to help her get out of her rut can she get out of her funk.Harold who finds himself losing the control he has always possessed is rendered helpless when he goes to do an audit on Ana Pacal a young woman who owes the IRS and refuses to file a return. Little by little Harold comes to depend on his meetings with Ana who in turn sees all the goodness in the man she started hating. It's when Harold discovers he has found love that he decides to fight for his life and decides to confront the woman who seems to be pulling the strings that make him be who he is.Will Farrell makes a wonderful contribution to the film. Like other comic actors Mr. Farrell has to play against type in order to show his talent. This versatile actor should play more serious roles and break out of the mold his career was up to this point. Emma Thompson's Karen Eiffel is one of her best creations. She captured the world in which the author she portrays inhabits. Dustin Hoffman adds another layer of texture to the film with his Professor Hilbert. Maggie Gylenhaal seems to be a natural for the sunny Ana Pascal. Queen Latifah plays Penny Escher effortlessly. She's a marvelous addition in any film. Others seen in minor roles are Linda Hunt and Tom Hulce who do wonders with their small contributions.Roberto Schaefer's cinematography offers a wonderful view of the Chicago where the film is supposed to take place. Ultimately it's Marc Forster for bringing all the elements together in this sunny and positive film.".

Then until they wangle a way of getting a British passport they lead the hunted humiliating lives of the illegal immigrant.  The Nigerian Okwe is one such person a pathologist in his home country he is reduced to driving cabs by day and moonlighting as the sole frontdesk worker in a London hotel by night.  During the day he grabs a couple of hours of sleep on the couch of a Turkish coworker a hotel maid named Senay played by Audrey Tatou.  As in most hotels in these straitened times the night staff deals with the usual sordid emergencies that arise when the nocturnal creatures of the city are on the prowl.  Prostitution and drugs are routine phenomena but when he finds a human heart clogging a toilet in one of the rooms Okwe realizes that something far more sinister is afoot.For the illegal immigrants portrayed in the film it is an ongoing struggle to hold onto some semblance of integrity humanity and dignity as the Society around them exploits and hounds them mercilessly safe in the knowledge that nothing would be reported to the authorities.  Each character makes more compromises and greater sacrifices all for freedom which as the tagline of the film sums up comes at a price.  Senay is a hair's breadth away from getting her residency papers when she runs afoul of the law and has to go on the lam to avoid deportation.  Okwe the cause of her problems feels dutybound to see that she remains safe.  But by persisting in his efforts to unravel the mystery of the heart in the toilet he becomes increasingly exposed to those who would harm him and Senay.Interestingly though this film is set in London none of the main characters is English  there's Juliette an ironicallynamed feisty West Indian hooker who plies her trade in the hotel Ivan the Russian doorman Senor Juan or Sneaky' another hotel employee who makes use of the hotel for his own moneymaking schemes Gou Yi a Chinese night porter in a morgue a motley collection of Somali Nigerian and Kenyan men who work at the cab company and the South Asian owner of a sweatshop.  Even the Immigration inspectors who make the dreaded surprise checks for illegal aliens are of color but they have been elevated into a privileged stratum of society by their passports.  These people alternately help each other and prey on each other for another person's frailty is always a source of profit while a person with knowledge of one's past is someone to be feared. The London we see through their eyes is unrecognizablesqualid begrimed crowded sleazy perilousnot at all the gleaming promised land of immigrant fantasies.Part anthropological documentary part thriller and part tentative unlikely love story this film keeps one riveted throughout.  The unfortunates in the film live by their wits and survive by hanging on to their senses of humor.  But as one degrading or dehumanizing experience piles itself atop another you see them question the worth of the Holy Grail that is the British passport.  However as there is no going back they are forced to continue. Every now and then they find it in themselves to hit back making you want to applaud their diffident costly bravery.The film belongs to the lead pair.  Ejiofor with his expressive dark eyes and handsome face registers every affront to his humanity he inhabits the character of Okwe completely and takes us along on the bleak dangerous journey that Okwe is forced into. Likewise Tatou breaks our hearts as she is exploited time and again she is an actress of such luminous transparency and vulnerability that one empathizes with every tribulation of Senay's. This is a far more dramatically demanding role than Amelie' and Tatou is up to its challenges.  Sergi Lopez who's starmaking turn in the French film With A Friend like Harry' did not go unnoticed in North America has created a charming whiskyguzzling monster in Senor Juan.  Juan is the ultimate amoral opportunist a Brylcreemed Mercedesdriving vulture and Lopez does not shy away from showing himself at his worst.

Stephen Frearsno stranger to the seamy side of human nature My Beautiful Launderette' Dangerous Liaisons' The Grifters' being cases in pointhas crafted the film with delicacy and intelligence.  A lesser director might have turned it into a sentimental morass but Frears with an unerring sense for a good story abstains from making his characters too noble too courageous or too upstanding rendering them altogether human and memorable.".

A lesser director might have turned it into a sentimental morass but Frears with an unerring sense for a good story abstains from making his characters too noble too courageous or too upstanding rendering them altogether human and memorable.";

It is a story about what happens to people that must go to a foreign country in order to survive and try to make a living in the worst possible circumstances just to help the ones they leave behind. In this case the people that are trying to better themselves as it's the case in the film get much more of what they've bargained for.The revelation in this picture is Chiwetel Ejiofor who is just brilliant as Okwe the illegal immigrant at the center of the story. He is a decent man who finds himself amongst unscrupulous people behind the sordid operation that goes on in the Baltic Hotel. This is an actor who can carry the picture he is a natural. Mr. Ejiofor has the unfortunate claim of not having a name or isn't a star by Hollywood's standard. Just imagine what a Denzel Washington or a Samuel L.

Audrey Tautou as Semay the Turkish immigrant that shares her flat with Okwe is used very effectively by the director. Gone are the cute excesses of Amelie. Another notable presence is Sophie Okoneko as a prostitute with the heart in the right place.The end of the film seems to prove there's justice in the world after all.

One night the Londoner prostitute Juliette Sophie Okonedo asks Okwe to fix the toilet of room 510 where she 'works' and he finds a human heart obstructing it. Okwe's further investigation discloses an invisible world of traffic of human organs of illegal immigrants in London. This excellent movie has a great screenplay about the urban legend of traffic of organs of the socially excluded immigrants in London. Just as a comparison in Brazil thousands of children of the lower classes vanish every year. The urban legend tells that they were adopted overseas or were used in the illegal traffic of human organs but these stories are only rumor in Internet. Therefore this theme in an excellent script is very attractive. Stephen Frears is one of the greatest directors of the cinema history and his movies are synonym of quality. The great surprise for me was the international cast leaded by the unknown Chiwetel Ejiofor followed by the excellent Audrey 'Amlie Poulain' Tautou and Sergi 'Harry' Lpez  and the also unknown Sophie Okonedo all of them with excellent performances. 'Dirty Pretty Things' is a highly recommended film. My vote is nine.Title Brazil 'Coisas Belas e Sujas' Pretty and Dirty Things'".

As Okwe and Senay find their very lives come under threat their relationship deepens into one of the more touching love stories in recent cinema history. One would honestly have to have a heart of stone not to blink at least one tear back as their story reaches its inevitable resolution.Through a powerful gripping and touching narrative Dirty Pretty Things is a film which successfully and unassumingly champions those unseen figures who constitute the base economy that holds our society together  as Okwe puts it 'the ones who drive your cabs who clean your toilets who suck your dicks'.

	schema:headline " Toronto Film Festival favorite";
	schema:reviewBody "Among the 18 nondocumentary films that I saw at last year's Toronto Film Festival  this new Stephen Frears offering was my favorite.  It isn't often that a cuttingedge foreign director who's taken a dip in Hollywood waters can ever recapture the style and flair that got him noticed by Hollywood in the first place but it would seem that French actress Audrey Tatou is a goodluck charm for a director attempting to perform such a feat.  2001 festival winner AMELIE resurrected JeanPierre Jeunet from the wreckage of ALIEN RESURRECTION and now DIRTY PRETTY THINGS makes for a supremely satisfying return to Frears' glory year of 1987 when he came out with the real London' backtoback art house successes that were SAMMY AND ROSIE GET LAID and PRICK UP YOUR EARS.  Frears was honored with a retrospective at the festival in 2000 and if tributes like these can provoke similar returntoform efforts from other directors ... I can sure suggest some names!I have only two minor cavils with the film.  One is with Tatou being cast as an illegallyworking Turkish immigrant in London.  Only the most culturallyilliterate of viewers could ever buy her as being Turkish she only makes a token effort at the accent.  But once you get past this minor annoyance her performance is otherwise excellent and a savvy career choice. Nothing like a trip to alltooreal London to avoid becoming overidentified with fantasyland Paris!   The other is with the morality of the lead character a former Nigerian doctor known only as Okwe' who's on the lam from a crime he was framed for after his medical ethics clashed with the wishes of state authorities.  It's a great compelling performance from unknowninAmerica Chiwetel Ejiofor  one that's sure to bring him plenty of North American roles  but in retrospect his character is just a little TOO morally upstanding to be fully credible.The film deals with a compelling subject  the handtomouth existence eked out by the huge numbers of illegal immigrants and illegallyworking immigrants who do all of the bottomrung work that nobody else wants to do in a teeming western metropolis.  Okwe has two jobs that leave him next to no time for any kind of personal life  a daytime cab driver and graveyard shift hotel night porter.

	onyx:emotionText "Among the 18 nondocumentary films that I saw at last year's Toronto Film Festival  this new Stephen Frears offering was my favorite.  It isn't often that a cuttingedge foreign director who's taken a dip in Hollywood waters can ever recapture the style and flair that got him noticed by Hollywood in the first place but it would seem that French actress Audrey Tatou is a goodluck charm for a director attempting to perform such a feat.  2001 festival winner AMELIE resurrected JeanPierre Jeunet from the wreckage of ALIEN RESURRECTION and now DIRTY PRETTY THINGS makes for a supremely satisfying return to Frears' glory year of 1987 when he came out with the real London' backtoback art house successes that were SAMMY AND ROSIE GET LAID and PRICK UP YOUR EARS.  Frears was honored with a retrospective at the festival in 2000 and if tributes like these can provoke similar returntoform efforts from other directors ... I can sure suggest some names!I have only two minor cavils with the film.  One is with Tatou being cast as an illegallyworking Turkish immigrant in London.  Only the most culturallyilliterate of viewers could ever buy her as being Turkish she only makes a token effort at the accent.  But once you get past this minor annoyance her performance is otherwise excellent and a savvy career choice. Nothing like a trip to alltooreal London to avoid becoming overidentified with fantasyland Paris!   The other is with the morality of the lead character a former Nigerian doctor known only as Okwe' who's on the lam from a crime he was framed for after his medical ethics clashed with the wishes of state authorities.  It's a great compelling performance from unknowninAmerica Chiwetel Ejiofor  one that's sure to bring him plenty of North American roles  but in retrospect his character is just a little TOO morally upstanding to be fully credible.The film deals with a compelling subject  the handtomouth existence eked out by the huge numbers of illegal immigrants and illegallyworking immigrants who do all of the bottomrung work that nobody else wants to do in a teeming western metropolis.  Okwe has two jobs that leave him next to no time for any kind of personal life  a daytime cab driver and graveyard shift hotel night porter.  He tries to resist letting anyone know that he's really a doctor but his cab boss knows and this forces him to maintain some lowlevel ties to the medical community.  Later some detective work at the hotel leads to him discovering a blackmarket operation in human organs being run by his hotel boss.As you can probably surmise another painful medical moment of truth looms in the doctor's future following this discovery.

I also can't help thinking that this movie and the one right before it He Loves Me were attempts to eradicate the typecasting of the movie right before that Amelie where she is impeccable. Here she is quirky and almost strange but in a likable way and by the end she is partly why you feel so strongly for Eijofor.The social point of this movie is a good underlying oneto show what life is really like for a large number of decent hardworking people many hiding from bureaucracy and immigration rules.

	schema:reviewBody "Stephen Frears has once again given viewers a fascinating look at characters that seem to live in societies cracks and its underbelly. This film is about an illegal immigrant from Nigeria named Okwe Chiwetel Ejiofor who drives a minicab part time and also works the front desk at a hotel. He sleeps on the couch of another illegal immigrant who works as a chambermaid. Her name is Senay Audrey Tautou who is Turkish and secretly in love with Okwe and they both have to be careful of immigration officials. The night manager at the hotel is Sneaky Sergi Lopez and he is involved in vile schemes behind the doors of the hotel. One night Okwe is checking a stopped up toilet in a room and he finds it clogged with a human heart. He asks some questions but Sneaky tells him to mind his own business. Immigration officials are tracking Senay and she finds another job at a sweat factory sewing but the owner of that business makes her give sexual pleasures in order for her to keep her job. Okwe talks to his Asian friend Guo Yi Benedict Wong who works at the hospital morgue about the heart and he tells him that many illegal immigrants give up their kidneys in exchange for citizenship. Its then that he figures out Sneaky is behind these illegal operations but Okwe cannot tell anyone in fear of being deported. Senay dreams of going to New York and makes a deal with Sneaky about giving him her kidney. Okwe was a surgeon in Nigeria and asks Sneaky that in exchange for two passports he will perform the operation. Stephen Frears has again directed a film with characters that are on the fringe of normal society. This is a carefully detailed script and each one of these characters is well written. One of the interesting things about this film is that each character is of a different nationality. Sneaky is a Spaniard Yi is Asian The doorman is Russian Okwe is Nigerian and Senay is Turkish. Each of them have jobs that most of us would not want. But Frears wants us to realize what people perform these tasks and how difficult it is to do some of these jobs and stay true to their morals and beliefs. This is a fascinating character study of a bunch of people that a lot of us take for granted. The characters are all so well written and we have come to expect this from Frears. Okwe was a surgeon and exiled out of Nigeria and he is haunted by his past. Senay is a virgin but in love with Okwe and she wants to go be with her sister and not be like her mother Yi understands Asian customs and when he gets an Asian body he makes sure it is prepared correctly for their religious service. Beautifully detailed script paints a riveting look at immigrants who do what they have to in order to survive. It's not a pretty picture but Frears usually doesn't direct pretty films. Along with The Grifters this is arguably his best film. Although I wouldn't call it a mystery it does work on that level. What I would call it though is a carefully detailed character study. The performances are all exceptional and Ejiofor is the centerpiece of the film. He shows he can carry a film and definitely has screen presence. I think this is an important role for Tautou who was probably bombarded with scripts for romantic comedies following the huge success of Amelie. She wanted to show that she's capable of a lot more than that and this was definitely an excellent step in that direction. She's very good in this film. And Lopez gives us a villain that you will not easily forget. He's not some high profile gangster type with henchmen to help him. He's just a night manager at a seedy hotel but with the power to turn them all in to immigration if they don't follow his orders. Some have said that this is Stephen Frears masterpiece. After thinking about it who's to argue?".

	schema:headline " Out Of The Ordinary  Quite Unforgettable";
	schema:reviewBody "It's very unusual for the main characters in a thriller to be a disparate bunch of immigrants but it's probably even more unusual for a plot to revolve around the illegal trade in human body parts. The fact that this movie does both things shows just how out of the ordinary Dirty Pretty Things is and highlights one of the reasons why it's so interesting to watch.The action takes place in London where many immigrants routinely live with the constant threats of deportation blackmail and homelessness. Their circumstances make them fearful vulnerable to exploitation and often having to do things that deeply offend their consciences. The ways in which they come to terms with their predicaments often call for a great deal of resourcefulness and the formulation of some highly unorthodox solutions to deal with their most pressing problems.Illegal immigrant Okwe Chiwetel Ejiofor came to the U.K. as a fugitive from Nigeria where he'd been framed for the murder of his wife. In London after he finishes his daytime job as a taxi driver he goes on to his second job as a night porter at The Baltic Hotel. He rarely sleeps and keeps himself awake by chewing a potent herbal stimulant. When he does get the opportunity for a short nap he takes advantage of the kindness of Turkish refugee Senay Gelik Audrey Tautou who also works at the hotel as a cleaner and lets him rent the couch in her small flat to use when she's out at work.One night Juliette Sophie Okonedo a prostitute who regularly plies her trade in the hotel mentions to Okwe that there's a problem in room 510 and when he checks it out  he discovers a toilet that's blocked by the presence of a human heart. Okwe who'd been a doctor in Nigeria immediately recognises what the organ is and suggests to his boss that the matter be reported to the police but Senor Juan Sergi Lopez who's generally known as Sneaky isn't inclined to do so. It's through this incident that Okwe eventually discovers that Sneaky is running an illegal business which involves the removal of vital organs from desperate people for money or counterfeit passports so that the body parts can be sold on to his black market buyers.Under the terms of Senay's temporary visa she's not allowed to be gainfully employed or to sublet her flat. One day when a couple of Immigration Officers arrive to check if anyone else is living at her place they discover a Baltic Hotel book of matches and this leads to them being at the hotel next day when the day shift is arriving so that they can check if she's working there. Their plan is thwarted when Okwe tips off the hotel's doorman and he prevents Senay from entering the hotel. Senay knows it's no longer safe to go back to the hotel to work so she instead gets a job at a local sweatshop but when it's raided by the Immigration Officers she gets blackmailed by her employer into granting him sexual favours.After making some investigations of his own Sneaky discovers that Okwe practised as a doctor in Nigeria and tries to recruit him to work in his criminal business. Okwe finds this idea morally repugnant but eventually realises that as an illegal he has little choice in the matter. After Senay's predicament becomes intolerable she realises that the only way she'll ever be able to achieve her ambition to go and live in New York City would be to sell one of her kidneys. It's at this point that Okwe comes up with an inspired solution to both their problems.This movie benefits from the presence of the exceptional Chiwetel Ejiofor who conveys Okwe's intelligence dignity and stoicism in a way that's both incredibly natural and very powerful. Audrey Tautou in her first Englishspeaking role makes Senay's constant fear and desperation very real and uses a busy style of walking as a manifestation of her character's singleminded determination. She's also very amusing and charming at times e.g. in the scene where she asks if she can wipe Okwe's brow. Sergi Lopez is terrific as the villainous Sneaky and the remaining members of the supporting cast also turn in some really good performances.Dirty Pretty Things is an extraordinary movie and one that will inevitably stay lodged in the minds of its audience for a long time after they've seen it.".

The best way to describe Dirty pretty things is in my opinion that it is like a beautiful poem. It flows easily and because of the fact that the cast are such good actorsactresses almost every scene in the film affects you in some way and it is so realistic sometimes you actually forget that you are watching a film. This is the reality as seen through the eyes of Okwe and Senay who work in a seedy hotel which is ruled by Sneaky . They are in constant fear of being discovered by immigration agents who pop up at the most inopportune moments and to top this all it seems the hotel where they work in is being the focus of something quite dirty when Okwe makes a grisly discovery in a toilet after a call girl he is blackmailed into participating in the illegal plot he uncovers which later threatens to overcome Senay as she succumbs to the pressure of legalizing her papers. Nice pacing occasional dark humor brought in from time to time Dirty Pretty Things never goes overboard with flashy chase sequences or explosions or implausible villains but benefits from a grimier yet equally intense approach that conveys its message of the helplessness marginalized immigrants feel in a foreign country compounded by the determination to survive at all costs even when the situation seems grim. Yet this film isn't just a mystery about downtrodden immigrants trying to survive. This film also trusts that the audience will follow what is going on silently with Okwe and Senay and that in itself is refreshing. Furthermore there are comic touches. The end of the film seems to prove there is justice in the world after all. The same system that creates a living hell for Okwe and Senay while they are underground gives them new identities to face a better future somewhere else.".

	schema:headline " Riveting film about illegal immigrants and their plight";
	schema:reviewBody "Okwe Chiwetel Ejiofor is a Nigerian illegal immigrant in London. This brooding man drives a taxi by day and works as a porter at a plush hotel in London by night. He supposedly never sleeps and chews on some kind of leaves to keep himself awake. He is a kind man popular and wellloved amongst fellow immigrants who live a handtomouth existence in the city doing odd jobs as custodians cleaners cooks cabbies. Okwe also helps out his friends and other poor immigrants with their ailments apparently he has some history working as a doctor in his home country! Okwe has an arrangement with another illegal immigrant a shy Turkish woman named Senay Audrey Tautou wherein he uses her couch in her small room to catch a few winks during morning time when she reports to work in the same hotel he works in. He also likes Senay and she likes him but nothing has been said yet. Senay is too reserved and shy and fears the neighbours. She does not want to attract unwanted attention especially from nosey gossipers! Any wrong move can lead to her deportation the immigration officials are already harassing her.A dramatic change of events occurs one day and it sets off a series of episodes that threaten to change the lives of Okwe and Senay forever. A prostitute Juliette Sophie Okonedo asks Okwe to check a room she has been in. Okwe inspects the room and finds that the toilet bowl is blocked and overflowing. He is shocked to discover that the cause of the blockage is a human heart stuck in the pipes! The Spanish night manager Senor Sneaky Juan Sergi Lopez seems to be well aware and tries to bribe Okwe to keep his mouth shut. Okwe gradually discovers that there is something sinister and dirty beneath the pretty hotel exterior.Dirty Pretty Things is a tale about dreams. It is about those countless immigrants who dream of making a better living in a rich developed country of having the kind of life and freedom they could never have in their home countries. It is about how they would give their eye and teeth to have a legal status! Survival is on the knife's edge as is the case for any illegal immigrant in a big city who wants to 'escape' to paradise. Steven Knight's screenplay is refreshingly original barring some minor clichd characterization and blatant racial stereotyping which prove to be the glitches in an otherwise superb work of writing It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. Stephen Frears turns Knight's script into an intriguing thriller that's also a gutwrenchingly potent drama centered around illegal immigrants in London.The story is told in a crisp fashion with some beautiful cinematography and commendable shot composition and the preliminary scenario is established rather quickly but doesn't seem hurried or forced in any way. It hardly takes any time for the plot to take off which works in the film's favour. The character of Okwe quickly strikes a chord with the audiences with most of the first few minutes revolving around him and his deeds. What doesn't work is how most characters including Okwe to some extent are instantly recognizable as either good or bad or kind or unkind and don't deviate from these traits of theirs! Okwe for example is shown to be such an impossibly noble and kind soul that you can't possibly think he can harm anyone. On the other hand there's 'Sneaky' Juan who is like the ultimate personification of 'slimy' staring you in the face! Some lines of dialog including some oozing racial stereotyping are just too blatantly rude to be taken seriously.And then there are some character clichs like the helpful buddy Guo an Asian man who works at the hospital mortuary the hooker with a heart of gold Juliette Senay's fat and horny old immigrant employer Barber Ali a sweatshop foreman who notsurprisingly asks her for sexual favours in return for not revealing her identity or whereabouts to the hot on the trail immigration officials.. ! Hand it to the filmmaker and the actors though that despite these clichs the viewer ultimately ends up rooting for them anyway! Audrey Tautou is in fact miscast as a Turkish woman and although one really wonders why someone from Turkey would have to go through all the tough ordeals to secure a status for themselves in London she delivers a kind of performance that you can't overlook and can't help but applaud. Senay's predicament and her dealing with the whole situation is pulled off in a sincere effort by Tautou. Ditto for Sergi Lopez as the crooked hotel manager who has something dirty up his sleeve. The guy is despicable to say the least and portrays his onedimensional character in an extremely convincing manner.But the big winner in the performances department is of course Chiwetel Ejiofor as Okwe. His character is written in a manner which will surely evoke great empathy. Ejiofor makes the character his own and steals the show from right under everyone's noses with a fabulous performance and manages to instantly connect with the viewer. He is a helpful kind selfless man but you very much know that he has a great sadness about him. It is a brilliant portrayal of a tortured soul an epitome of selfsacrifice.It is worthwhile to check out Stephen Frears' Dirty Pretty Things. While it may not be perfect it is a fine work of cinema that is gripping as well as emotionally affecting and will keep you hooked 'til it reaches its bittersweet conclusion.Score 810.".

It is about those countless immigrants who dream of making a better living in a rich developed country of having the kind of life and freedom they could never have in their home countries. It is about how they would give their eye and teeth to have a legal status! Survival is on the knife's edge as is the case for any illegal immigrant in a big city who wants to 'escape' to paradise. Steven Knight's screenplay is refreshingly original barring some minor clichd characterization and blatant racial stereotyping which prove to be the glitches in an otherwise superb work of writing It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. Stephen Frears turns Knight's script into an intriguing thriller that's also a gutwrenchingly potent drama centered around illegal immigrants in London.The story is told in a crisp fashion with some beautiful cinematography and commendable shot composition and the preliminary scenario is established rather quickly but doesn't seem hurried or forced in any way. It hardly takes any time for the plot to take off which works in the film's favour. The character of Okwe quickly strikes a chord with the audiences with most of the first few minutes revolving around him and his deeds. What doesn't work is how most characters including Okwe to some extent are instantly recognizable as either good or bad or kind or unkind and don't deviate from these traits of theirs! Okwe for example is shown to be such an impossibly noble and kind soul that you can't possibly think he can harm anyone. On the other hand there's 'Sneaky' Juan who is like the ultimate personification of 'slimy' staring you in the face! Some lines of dialog including some oozing racial stereotyping are just too blatantly rude to be taken seriously.And then there are some character clichs like the helpful buddy Guo an Asian man who works at the hospital mortuary the hooker with a heart of gold Juliette Senay's fat and horny old immigrant employer Barber Ali a sweatshop foreman who notsurprisingly asks her for sexual favours in return for not revealing her identity or whereabouts to the hot on the trail immigration officials.. ! Hand it to the filmmaker and the actors though that despite these clichs the viewer ultimately ends up rooting for them anyway! Audrey Tautou is in fact miscast as a Turkish woman and although one really wonders why someone from Turkey would have to go through all the tough ordeals to secure a status for themselves in London she delivers a kind of performance that you can't overlook and can't help but applaud. Senay's predicament and her dealing with the whole situation is pulled off in a sincere effort by Tautou. Ditto for Sergi Lopez as the crooked hotel manager who has something dirty up his sleeve. The guy is despicable to say the least and portrays his onedimensional character in an extremely convincing manner.But the big winner in the performances department is of course Chiwetel Ejiofor as Okwe. His character is written in a manner which will surely evoke great empathy. Ejiofor makes the character his own and steals the show from right under everyone's noses with a fabulous performance and manages to instantly connect with the viewer. He is a helpful kind selfless man but you very much know that he has a great sadness about him. It is a brilliant portrayal of a tortured soul an epitome of selfsacrifice.It is worthwhile to check out Stephen Frears' Dirty Pretty Things. While it may not be perfect it is a fine work of cinema that is gripping as well as emotionally affecting and will keep you hooked 'til it reaches its bittersweet conclusion.Score 810.";

A prostitute complains of an overflowing toilet and Okwe pulls out a human heart and shows it to the manager Juan.

	schema:reviewBody "It has been said that desperate times call for desperate measures a concept that director Stephen Frears explores to great success in Dirty Pretty Things. Frears whose previous films include My Beautiful Laundrette and The Grifters has a knack for getting inside his characters' minds and revealing their inner workings to his audience with heartfelt compassion. Such is the case again.Chwetel Ojiofor plays Okwe a Nigerian refugee in London who works two jobs. As a cabbie he tells a potential fare I am here to rescue those who have been let down by the system and he's not kidding. Shortly thereafter we see him sharing his illegal identity with his fellow drivers for they are all in the same precarious position of trying to earn enough to survive while evading the immigration authorities.Also eluding the authorities is Senay Audrey Tautou of last year's Amelie a young Turkish woman who reluctantly shares her meager flat with Okwe in order to make ends meet on her equally meager and equally illegal salary as a chambermaid in the seedy Baltic Hotel. It is there one night that Okwe in his second job as the hotel's concierge comes upon what he believes is a human heart clogging the plumbing in a room previously used by a local prostitute Sophie Okonedo. From here the film's story takes off.Okwe should know what a human heart looks like because we learn he was a doctor in Nigeria a family man who was forced by circumstances to leave his daughter behind. Either out of the desire to suppress his feelings and memories or the sincere need to keep working Okwe stays awake with the help of an herbal leaf. In lieu of sleep he plays chess with a friend an Asian hospital custodian Benedict Wong who works in the morgue. It is through this relationship that Okwe gains access to the hospital's other resources including the pharmaceuticals he provides to his fellow cabbies who are infected with gonorrhea.Despite Okwe's efforts to keep his past identity secret the scheming and manipulative Seor Juan a deliciously nasty Sergi Lopez the Baltic's unscrupulous manager discovers the truth and presents Okwe with an offer too despicable for him to accept. It is only when Okwe discovers that Senay now employed as a factory worker and hounded by the authorities and an abusive boss has agreed to participate in Seor Juan's scheme that Okwe agrees. To say more about the plot would unfairly reveal too much. Working from Steven Knight's script Frears choreographs a believable dance of growing love between Okwe and Senay. That their love is constrained by unspoken and until the end undisclosed extenuating circumstances does not diminish the power of the bond that is forged between them. Indeed but for the connection they share neither Okwe nor Senay might be able to muster the strength to hold fast to their dreams.Their present exile as anonymous members of London's working class notwithstanding Okwe and Senay do have dreams. For Senay it is to go to New York where she fantasizes the trees are always lit up and the policemen ride white horses for Okwe it is to return to his native land. For both the prospect of realizing such futures seems dismally bleak. Until that is they accept a sordid offer in exchange for cash and forged passports. It is from a line of this offer's dialogue that the film takes its title. In what is surely the film's most thrilling and surprising moment Frears gives the viewer a splendid opportunity to cheer for the longoppressed underdog now empowered.It is to the plight of these underdogs these members of London's working class who are consigned to lives of quiet and anonymous desperation that the film unglamorously dedicates its purpose for they are the ones who comprise the city's human infrastructure the unseen force that keeps its wheels turning. Frears approaches the material and his characters with an even emotional hand neither turning them into pathetic caricatures nor heroic survivors. He presents them humanistically against the backdrop of a London that is teeming with life and rife with grit an underbelly of the city not often seen by American moviegoers. Cinematographer Chris Menges makes the most of his skills here depicting London's seamier side without polish or frippery.Although Dirty Pretty Things is successful as commentary it is an equally entertaining nongenre thriller. Despite its fetid environs the film is a breath of rarified air. While those desperate to escape formulaic franchise fare may want to shower afterwards they will not be disappointed by any of the dirty pretty things in this film.".

	schema:headline " The best Bond i have ever seen Daniel Craig's first best Bond 007 my third favorite";
	schema:reviewBody "Casino Royale 2006 is without doubt one of the best Ian Fleming's James Bond. This is the real film the real Bond film unlike lackluster shy Die Another Day stupid movie! I have enjoyed this film so damn much! I love this film to death from action sequence to actors and the plot story I love it. The film is very realistic serious well portrayed it has no jokes. It is my favorite because it is action action action and even more action. Casino Royale 2006 is the twentyfirst spy film in the Eon Productions James Bond film series and is the third screen adaptation of Ian Fleming's 1953 novel of the same name.I make no apologies for believing that Daniel Craig really did become the closest thing we've seen to IAN FLEMING's James Bond. I'm a hardcore James Bond fan I love a lot of the films that over 50 years were made. Casino Royale is simply my third favorite James Bond film it is in my top 10 favorite James Bond films. This movie is interesting totally mindblowing. It is highly entertaining espionage with a lot of action sequence. Not boring or lame but believable well acted.After lackluster fiasco and disaster Die Another Day 2002 producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli fired actor Pierce Brosnan because he wanted too much money to shoot a fifth Bond movie and producers had already decided to reboot the longrunning spy saga with a grittier approach. Daniel Craig ultimately took over the role for 2006's Casino Royale and has gone on to achieve success as arguably the most popular 007 since the days of Sean Connery.Daniel Craig is fantastic as new James Bond tough I love Pierce Brosnan this is the real deal. Actress Samantha Bond also left James Bond saga after 4 movies since Brosnan was fired and this movie did not used Miss Moneypenny.Eva Green as the new Bond's girl Vesper Lynd did an excellent performance and a fine job playing James Bond's first true love. Green and Craig have electric chemistry on screen together. Vesper's character seems ambiguous impudent and complicated. One nightslumped in the shower fully clothed radiating inner beautyher quiet look is capable to melt Bond's cold heart and free his doubtful mind. In another she disconcerts him with her pretty 'Algerian love knot.Judi Dench as M is always awesome and she did a fantastic well done job. In GoldenEye Tomorrow Never Dies The World is Not Enough and this movie she did a well done excellent job. I love the actress and I had a blast watching her on screen.Mads Mikkelsen is the villain banker Le Chiffre Mads Mikkelsen who tries to get rich in supplying funds for terrorists. The actor did incredible job as the main villain and I really absolutely loved his performance.Jeffrey Wright plays the new undercover CIA agent Felix Leiter 'bleeding chips at the poker tournament' and Giancarlo Giannini plays the 'contact' Mathis.The Italian actress Caterina Murino plays Solange who reveals her sexy side as the frustrated woman so upset in her marriage.Armed with a license to kill Secret Agent James Bond sets out on his first mission as 007 and must defeat a private banker to terrorists in a high stakes game of poker at Casino Royale Montenegro but things are not what they seem.Bond Daniel Craig is chasing a terrorist bomber Mollaka Sebastien Foucan who was contracted by terrorist organization to make and sell a bomb. While Bond chases him he has to jump on a several sky cranes and on a building to continue the chase. Real stunt performance from stunt man and actor Daniel Craig.

	onyx:emotionText "Casino Royale 2006 is without doubt one of the best Ian Fleming's James Bond. This is the real film the real Bond film unlike lackluster shy Die Another Day stupid movie! I have enjoyed this film so damn much! I love this film to death from action sequence to actors and the plot story I love it. The film is very realistic serious well portrayed it has no jokes. It is my favorite because it is action action action and even more action. Casino Royale 2006 is the twentyfirst spy film in the Eon Productions James Bond film series and is the third screen adaptation of Ian Fleming's 1953 novel of the same name.I make no apologies for believing that Daniel Craig really did become the closest thing we've seen to IAN FLEMING's James Bond. I'm a hardcore James Bond fan I love a lot of the films that over 50 years were made. Casino Royale is simply my third favorite James Bond film it is in my top 10 favorite James Bond films. This movie is interesting totally mindblowing. It is highly entertaining espionage with a lot of action sequence. Not boring or lame but believable well acted.After lackluster fiasco and disaster Die Another Day 2002 producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli fired actor Pierce Brosnan because he wanted too much money to shoot a fifth Bond movie and producers had already decided to reboot the longrunning spy saga with a grittier approach. Daniel Craig ultimately took over the role for 2006's Casino Royale and has gone on to achieve success as arguably the most popular 007 since the days of Sean Connery.Daniel Craig is fantastic as new James Bond tough I love Pierce Brosnan this is the real deal. Actress Samantha Bond also left James Bond saga after 4 movies since Brosnan was fired and this movie did not used Miss Moneypenny.Eva Green as the new Bond's girl Vesper Lynd did an excellent performance and a fine job playing James Bond's first true love. Green and Craig have electric chemistry on screen together. Vesper's character seems ambiguous impudent and complicated. One nightslumped in the shower fully clothed radiating inner beautyher quiet look is capable to melt Bond's cold heart and free his doubtful mind. In another she disconcerts him with her pretty 'Algerian love knot.Judi Dench as M is always awesome and she did a fantastic well done job. In GoldenEye Tomorrow Never Dies The World is Not Enough and this movie she did a well done excellent job. I love the actress and I had a blast watching her on screen.Mads Mikkelsen is the villain banker Le Chiffre Mads Mikkelsen who tries to get rich in supplying funds for terrorists. The actor did incredible job as the main villain and I really absolutely loved his performance.Jeffrey Wright plays the new undercover CIA agent Felix Leiter 'bleeding chips at the poker tournament' and Giancarlo Giannini plays the 'contact' Mathis.The Italian actress Caterina Murino plays Solange who reveals her sexy side as the frustrated woman so upset in her marriage.Armed with a license to kill Secret Agent James Bond sets out on his first mission as 007 and must defeat a private banker to terrorists in a high stakes game of poker at Casino Royale Montenegro but things are not what they seem.Bond Daniel Craig is chasing a terrorist bomber Mollaka Sebastien Foucan who was contracted by terrorist organization to make and sell a bomb.

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this at a cast and crew screening in London last weekend I'm not a huge Bond fan but I do enjoy them on a purely popcorn level and this was definitely one of the best in recent memory. The tone is much edgier and nastier than the Brosnan movies harking back more to Dr. No or For Your Eyes Only. The action sequences are brilliantly shot and edited for maximum impact and are some of the best out of any Bond movie. Martin Campbell who also made 'Goldeneye' was an excellent choice and for me is one of the best Bond directors. What gives this the lead over recent Bonds is the more realistic feel the exotic locales fast cars spectacular action beautiful women and many other Bond hallmarks are all here but gone is the campy tone that marred say Die Another Day. Yes the whole franchise is based on an entirely ridiculous and cartoonish notion but the more serious and harderedged tone works really well here. In this context Daniel Craig gives an excellent performance as Bond. I'll be the first to admit that I raised an eyebrow when I heard he was cast but he really makes it his own. It's hard to say whether he's better than any of the other Bonds Connery and Brosnan felt right for the style of Bond movies they were in. Here as suits the overall tone of the film Bond is much more of a sadist a coldhearted killer with very little sense of empathy and Craig with his piercing eyes suits the role very well. He's charming and funny when required and totally convincing in the action sequences. The violence is less cartoonlike and flippant too with every punch kick and shooting looking like they really hurt. Also the story is just much more engaging than many a Bond film the script's not going to win awards but it's consistently inventive and intriguing. Whilst the film has enough of it's fair share of action the emphasis is equally on character and storyline and less on gadgets and sheer implausibility. When there isn't a huge action sequence happening you don't miss it the film's longest setpiece the poker game at the Casino Royale is as or not more gripping and entertaining than any of the chases and shootouts. The only minor gripes that I have are a slightly too long running time the film drags a wee bit towards the end and although it helps the tone of the film we don't hear enough of the Bond theme tune! However great directing and performances from everyone involved along with Phil Meheux's excellent cinematography Peter Lamont's as ever superb production design and all the other topnotch craft and technical departments make 'Casino Royale' a classy and very enjoyable night out at the movies.".

Like OHMSS there are moments when the running time feels its length and others where you think something's missing because they suddenly tried to trim the running time by not shooting bits. At times you'd be grateful for a little bit of exposition BEFORE a couple of the big action scenes rather than after. And some of the script has some lines as subtle as a car crash that stink of Paul Haggis' brand of heavy handedness. The big finale is just a bit too much as if they're afraid not to destroy some big building again because that's what they always do.Having got that out of the way none of that matters that much because this is the best Bond since George Lazenby thought he had all the time in the world. It's got a strong plot for once and makes it even stronger by showing us where Bond came from and how he smoothed away some of the rough edges. And the edges are brutally rough here. The killings are nasty and the aftermath has to be dealt with in a way Bonds have never done before.The real ace in the hand is Craig. He doesn't have Connery's raw star quality but he's easily the best actor to have played the part. I don't know if the film was shot in sequence but for the only time since OHMSS you get a sense of Bond changing throughout the film as his cockiness becomes confidence and his brutality becomes cold efficiency. He starts off unlikeable but human and gradually picks up the Bond traits we know until he becomes more likable but just a little less human. It's an interesting journey and Craig is up to it. It's not just his delivery it's also his body language. Even his fighting style changes as he adapts.Physically he's the most in your face Bond since Lazenby and the action scenes look brutal for once. Even the not very likely free running chase is spectacular but believable because you get the idea that this really is kill or be killed stuff. It's got a real feel of danger to it that hasn't been seen in the series in years. Only the torture scene feels like it's holding back it's almost as tastefully done as the old TV version but that's probably fear of the censors.You'll come out of this one not just thinking that Daniel Craig IS James Bond but that noone has ever played him before. Let's all hope EON don't lose their nerve with Bond 22 and bring back the scifi stuff and gadgets because this could be a real new beginning! See it and you'll believe it.".

Congratulations. James Bond will live on for at least one more generation and maybe forever. Great set pieces and one of the best chase sequences not involving cars ever put on screen blended with beautiful locations and even more lovely women add up to the perfect cocktail with the twisting story line acting as the lemon peel in the martini holding it all together. Many will come out saying that this is the best Bond film ever and I can not rightly say they are wrong at this point. Only time will tell that tale. However every fan can be assured that this ranks amongst the very upper crust of Bond movies and Craig is no Lazenby. He lends a harsh wit and a thuggish charm to the character and by the end he's no longer the new guy he is Bond James Bond. A masterpiece of popular filmmaking and the movie we have been waiting for all year. See it early and often as it is sure not to diminish upon reviewing.".

A masterpiece of popular filmmaking and the movie we have been waiting for all year. See it early and often as it is sure not to diminish upon reviewing.";

	schema:reviewBody "What a difference a great actor makes. Daniel Craig is superb as James Bond and parting from that point everything in it is enjoyable frightening thrilling just because we're with him. He conquered us from the word go. The initial chase is one of the best in film history and as soon as we get to know this new incarnation of the iconic Ian Fleming character we're hooked. He's virile but there is room for ambiguity. He's elegant but as the sensational Eva Green points out is more acquired than inherited. More working class than even Sean Connery and that works wonders for Mr Bond. The script is more compact and organic. The locations are breathtaking and what else I can say? The series have been reinvigorated rejuvenated and in one single stroke have secured that this franchise will live forever. A note to Barbara Broccoli the producer your father would be so proud. Congratulations!".

	schema:reviewBody "In the original Bond series only a handful of films really attempted to touch base with the novels of Ian Fleming. Dr. No showed the Fleming feeling for character and action but introduced elements to the plot that detracted from the 'hardboiled' spy story that Fleming thought he was writing Thunderball came close but that was because Fleming developed the story on commission for the film. On Her Majesty's Secret Service had the book's plot pretty down pat and was made in a kind of 'grand adventure' style but of course it suffered from the choice of Lazenby  a professional model not an actor  as Bond. The Living Daylights showed the producers' interest in returning to the roots but Dalton was uncomfortable playing Bond and uncomfortable with the wisecracks which had become part of the character's schtick  and which were really badly written for the Dalton films. Goldeneye was admirable attempt to update the Fleming milieu for the end of the Cold War but left the character himself as yet without an 'updated' definition.The decision to make a 21st Century version of Fleming's first Bond novel  and beyond the update to remain true to the novel sans comic patter sans scifi technoschtick sans major rewrite of the basic plot  promised to present Bond fans of all ages with a direct challenge. Do we want the hardboiled spy Fleming first envisioned  patterned after Chandler's Philip Marlowe and W. Somerset Maughm's Ashenden or The British Agent? Or would we really rather have the suave standup comedian and Playboy magazine contributor introduced by Broccoli Maibaum Young and company in the second Connery film From Russia With Love?Well the votes are still being tallied on that.As someone who came to Bond reading Goldfinger at the tender age of twelve the phrase round firm pointed breasts has been an inspiration to me since the closer the films came to the sense of the novels the happier I was.So of course this version of Bond is a joyous surprise for me  my youthful daydreams have been vindicated and at last fully satisfied. There are indeed elements added to the plot but they are completely congruent with it. There is the use of current technology but no technoschtick  i.e. no Q. and no gadgets. There are the luscious Bond babes 2  the minimum Bond requirement but there is no attempt to reduce them to photogenic sextoys.Fleming's plot actually requires the film's addition of some heavy action sequences all done very snappy with a brutally realistic edge because the novel is very claustrophobic the original TV version of the story 1955 with Barry Nelson as 'Jimmy Bond' only used three indoor sets because it could  except for the car chase and an attempted bombing at an outdoor caf Fleming's novel took place almost entirely within Bond's hotel suite and the gaming room. The film's opening this novel out to the world is actually quite welcome and does not affect the central plot or its theme.The character of Bond presented in this film may disappoint followers of the original films but the news is this is FLEMING's Bond  an orphan uncertain of his own identity a disillusioned romantic trying hard to pretend he's incapable of emotions a middle class middlebrow middlelevel management type who just happens to kill people for a living. But he does it extremely well.The other problem some general viewers may have is the level of violence in the film having determined to film the novel realistically director Martin Campbell has decided to ditch the 'Bmovie' violence of most of the earlier films and present us the violence with a hard 'British neonoir' edge to it. Given the romantic plot twist toward the end this would be a perfect date movie  except that the violence left some of the female viewers in the theater I attended clearly unsettled. That's not necessarily a bad thing it just is part of the gestalt of the film's experience.Cambell's direction is very good the writing is crisp production values are very high the photography is stunning. Some of the stunt work is truly remarkable worthy competition for Jackie Chan. The acting is rocksolid and believable for these characters. There is plenty of muscle for the actionfilm fan and some real brains for the more general viewer to ponder later. This film is best viewed with minimal reliance on knowledge of the previous series. In fact it functions perfectly well as a 'oneoff' a film without a series.But of course the ending invites a sequel. In Godzilla terms Connery and Moore having given us the 'showa' Bond Dalton and Brosnan the Heisei Bond we now have the Millenium series James Bond  not a prequel nor even a 'reboot' but really an entirely new series about the same character. It is probably too much to hope for but maybe they can make the sequels just as good as this.As a genre film it never quite lifts above its genre so normally I would only give it nine stars as a film.However as a film within its genre it is topoftheline  so it gets a ten.".

	schema:headline " An impressively dark engaging and exciting entry in the Bond series  just what it needed after Die Another Day";
	schema:reviewBody "Having just achieved his 00 status James Bond is assigned to uncover a plot by tracking a bomber for hire. The mission could not go worse as Bond kills the man in an embassy in front of CCTV cameras. Removed from the mission by M Bond nevertheless follows the only lead he has to Miami where he finds himself working round the edges of a plot by criminal Le Chiffre to invest his clients money in the stock market just before an engineered event should send shares in a direction favourable for him.After the poor CGI and overblown if fun affair that was Die Another Day the series was at risk of just throwing more and more money at the screen in an attempt to exaggerate and increase the Bond formula to keep fans happy. And in fairness it seems financially to be working for them but this is not to say that the drastically scaled back feel of Casino Royale is not a welcome change of direction for the series because for me it most certainly was. Opening with a gritty short and violent precredit sequence the film moves through a cool title sequence with a typically Bondian if only soso theme song. The film then immediately marks itself out as a step away from the previous film by launching on a great action sequence that is as overblown as the series requires but yet is all the better for seeming real  no ropy Die Another Day CGI here. Casting freerunner Foucan was a great move and this sequence was the high for me. After this the film develops nicely with a solid plot that engaged me easily enough with interesting characters along the way.Of course this isn't to say that the series has suddenly put out an introspective character piece because the world of Bond is all still here. So we have superhuman stunts gadgets albeit a practical selfdefibrillator as opposed to a minihelicopter and the usual types of characters going the way we expect. Those expecting this selfstyled reboot to provide a depth and emotion that isn't there will be disappointed but regardless this does the Bond formula well  fans will enjoy it and those that were turned off by Die Another Day will find it a welcome return to darker territory. With all the fanboys tired from bemoaning Craig it is nice to actually see for ourselves what he can do and mostly he is very good. He convinces as a heartless killer and has the presence that suggests that he could do ruthless damage if he had to. I was a bit put off by how regularly he pouts but generally he brings a gravitas to the character that it benefits from. Green is a pretty good Bond girl and brings much much more to the role than Berry did in the last film. Mikkelsen is a good foil for Bond and is given more interest by his lack of stature he is essentially facing his last role of the dice in several ways. Dench is as solid as ever while Wright makes a shrewd move in a small character that offers more of the same for a few years to come.Overall then this is not the brilliant flawless film that many have claimed but I completely understand why it has been greeted with such praise. Sat beside Die Another Day it is a wonderfully dark and brooding Bond with great action replacing some of the CGI and gadget excesses of recent times. Those upset at his blue eyes are best left fuming on the net because Craig is a great Bond  capable of being dark with the violence and offering the potential for more if the material comes to meet him. A refreshing film with the bond formula in place but with a dark and comparatively restrained tone that makes it realistic enough to get into while still existing in the spy fantasy world.".

This is Bond reinvented from the ground up.Which is probably a good thing.

Whether or not Craig can inhabit the role as Connery or Brosnan did and make it his own it still up for debate  but then this is only his first outing. He could be fantastic  emphasis on the COULD.But whether or not he is Bond Craig is a terrific action hero leaping from cranes shooting bad guys and generally wrecking havoc in the name of Queen and Country. Mads Mikkelson does himself proud as Le Chiffre a baddie so bad he weeps blood. Eva Green is suitably luminous as Vesper Lynd a woman who entrances even the stonyhearted 007 and the action is glorious enough to plug the holes in a flimsy plot. Oh and did I mention Judi Dench rocks as M? If this is Bond reborn it's good to see he's retained just a few things from his previous life.".

Cool action great thrills and a more humane Bond more than make up for the purported lack of gadgets. Daniel Craig plays Bond as a rough secret who only gradually acquires the class and cold demeanor we all know and love. He makes mistakes in the course of his mission but that makes him even more of a hero. Although I found it hard at first to cope with Craig's looks he is more than suitable as the character. Bond is portrayed as a man with flaws and weaknesses which makes him look even stronger. The story is not your usual Bond plot and relies more on classical thrills than technology though the action is extremely hardboiled. Kudos to the creepy Mads Mikkelsen as Le Chiffre and Eva Green as Vesper Lynd for creating remarkably believable characters. A definite mustsee for Bond fans  it should reconcile at last Ian Fleming aficionados and fans of the film series !".

Pierce Brosnan has been replaced by a youngish Daniel Craig there is no Q no campy gadgets no silly naked women silhouettes in the opening credits no worlddominating supercolossus villains no Miss Funnyfanny or whatever and no silly oneliners after killing bad guys. Basically everything that can date Bond film very quickly is gone. I never expected international espionage to look the way it has in past few Bond outings and I'm glad someone had the balls to go back to the hardedged nature of the series last seen in Licence to Kill.The longest Bond movie so far at 145 minutes but it breezes by even though it reigns in on the normally excessive action scenes and depicts spying a more 'mundane' and 'realistic' manner or at least as true as the series has been so far. But the onething that bugs me about action movies particularly the Bond franchise is that they are most of the time childish male fantasies with an indestructible hero who has fun shooting up the place and beds beautiful women. I would like something new for a change but Casino Royale does have Bond get hurt and go through more pain than he has previously.Daniel Craig got a lot of hassle over his casting as Bond but not only does he have his youth as an advantage he's the first 30something to be cast in the role since Lazenby he's also pretty damn trim has the intensity Brosnan lacked and is surprisingly loose in a role that usually requires actors to be stiff and unemotional. It's also good to a fresh face in the role and who cares if he is blonde? Or the shortest actor to play him so far? I would have preferred that composer David Arnold went too. They didn't seem to be holding back on the amount of regular production team members who got axed. Even Vic Armstrong didn't return. I've never liked Arnold's work on the movies and I hate to think of it as something that's now exclusively HIS baby.Unfortunately as good as this fresh start to the franchise was all of the goodwill that director Martin Campbell earned was completely undone by the followup Quantum of Solace which is not only the worst Bond film so far but one of the worst action films and one of the worst films overall that I have ever seen.If Craig and Co. ever get around to making another they've got a LOT to make up for.".

His ice cold looks seemed to be quite a stretch from the image we have of James Bond. Maybe they know some things I don't about 007 maybe I've been missing something about the character. Plusthe hype around the production was excellentthe rumor was that the filmmakers have decided to be more daring in many aspects. Nothing wrong with that as a long as you know what you're doing.But at the very first frame of the filmmy original skepticism reemergedThe opening scene happens in a sombre black and white cold war setting in which Bond makes no spectacular entrance chatting with his enemy and finishing the mission with his fists inside a...dirty public restroom. Then Bond spins around aiming his gun at the camera taking the classic pose. Right then I couldn't help myself but noticing the restroom tiles in the background! and this blond muscular hunk in the center of the screen suggesting  I am your NEW James Bond!. Not yetgentlemen did I think.Still let's give them a second chance here comes the longawaited opening credits. A beautiful animation of paisley patterns and stylized men fighting in slowmotionturning into flying heartsspadesclubs and diamonds at each blow. But something is missing where are the gorgeous nude feminine silhouettes? Where are the girls? Gone !!! Why???!!! At this point I feared the worst did the producers decide purposely to get rid of everything we actually loved about James Bond?! But here comes hopeJames Bond chases a man through a building siteclimbing on cranes jumping and falling hard. Great this might not be a real James Bond flick but at least we're in for some good entertainment. Right?Wrong The rest of the film is nothing but a long two and a half hours long!demonstration on how to annihilate a movie landmark character.No Monneypennyno Qno R and every time M Judi Drench appears on the screen the ONLY thing she ever does is begging Bond to stop doing what he's doing and come back to his senses. Yetall I could hear from her was What have you done to James Bond? Who are you blond man?! Why don't you ever smile? Why don't you ever say anything witty? How come the only gadget you use is a cell phone? How dare you wreck THE 1964 Aston Martin in only 3 minutes? How could you fall in love with such a boring girl? What do you want from us? Bring us back England's most precious hero!The other characters barely exist The villain named Le Chiffre is a card player who's task is to finance terrorism by playing poker. Does he cheat ? no. Why? He might be a villain but will not take his cruelty as far as... cheating! We know he's the villain since his left eye bleeds once in a while and he acts like everything is fine. Who knowsmaybe somedaywe'll get to see a villain who plays Monopoly with a runny nose. So scary.Then I thought I get it! His damaged eye is in fact a technological wonder that allows him to see the other player's cards thanks to the mysterious blond girl in the background who's eye is a camera placed surgically inside her head and feeds Le Chiffre with her own vision! Great!. Was I right ? Of course not that would be something you'd see in a James Bond film...But here comes the most sacrilegious scene EVER to come out of a James Bond filmJames Bond let's keep using this name for the lack of a better one is taken prisoner and dragged in a basement he is entirely stripped from his clothes and attached on a chair without a seat letting 007's genitals dangling from underneath Yesyou heard right. Le Chiffre proceeds to swing a large heavy rope and hits her majesty's favorite secret agent's nuts over and over. Bond screams in pain but does not reveal the bank account number. What a man. Does he escape? Does he fight back in the most ingenious manner and eliminates his torturer? No he passes out and wakes up in a hospital.The torture may have stopped for Bond but increases for me Bond finds comfort in the arms of his girlfriend Vesper yes girlfriend who tells him to rebuild his pride that even if the only thing left from him was his little finger she would still love him. To which the emasculated James Bond replies watch out humor coming your way That's because you know what I can do with my little finger. Can we please stop talking about mister Bond smashed testicles and go on with this neverendinggoingnowherestory?! And don't we know that if Bond was ever blown to smithereens the only thing left from him should precisely be his genitals?There were other problems with the film of coursesuch as the boring story and the fact that the casino which seemed to be the perfect setting for a James Bond film turned out to be so poorly exploited.Giving this film one star might not be fair do you ever read a review unless it has a 1 or a 10 star rating?but the main problem goes beyond the bad choices added by the filmmakers throughout the film. The problem is that the film was made with the wrong spirit and doesn't take in consideration that unlike other movies James Bond belongs more to the public than to its makers and that this rare fact deserves to be honored.Don't mess with MY James Bond.".

He was dull unwitty and had absolutely no charisma for such a role.Craig and Greens chemistry was horrible and the plot was disjointed and did not have the flow of some of the better Bond films. No gadgets no Q no decent action sequences.Shameful product placement. Every agent terrorist contact and bond villain whipped out there sony ericsson mobile every chance they got not to mention several sony vaio laptops and sony blueray disc players. I was actually shocked to see that M was pawning Bond on need for speed carbon on a PS3. Seriously though they must of shown every model phone they have they even had my K700i which is probably the worst piece of technology I have ever bought by the way. There was also a crack about what type of watch Bond wearsBOND Did you know that I'm a gaybo? VESPER Really but the thing I wanted to know is the brand of your watch? BOND OMEGA!!! Bond turns and smiles at the camera.Another issue I had with this movie was the amount of screen time Daniel Craig was either nude or partially nude this was not good as I had lunch just before I watched this.

Craig's characterization of Bond is charmless worthless and disturbingly nihilistic. At one point in the script Craig's Bond responds to a question with Do I look like I give a damn? The answer in Casino Royale is overwhelmingly NO. Why on earth then should the audience care about him? At another point he tells Vesper I have no idea what an honest job is. Is this a credible or creditable moral statement to hear from a toplevel government secret agent?

As a result of Craig's hollow Bond interpretation what should have been the film's ultimate impact moment007's Bond James Bond confrontation with villainous Mr. Whiteis surprisingly anticlimactic prompting a shrug rather than a cheer from this reviewer. Eva Green Bond Girl Vesper Lynd. Green's Vesper characterization comes across unwittingly as awkward unsophisticated. Green looks and acts like a teenager playing at grownup. What's missing is the mature presencefeminine poise that typifies the best Bond Girl actresses e.g. Ursula Andress Honor Blackman Diana Rigg Barbara Bach Maud Adams Izabella Scorupco et al. A selfconfessed complicated woman Green's Vesper remains maddeningly inscrutable to the end and her romance with Craig's Bond is ineptly developed and unconvincingly consummated. Judi Dench. Her M is more unsympathetic than ever. No other actress has ever contributed less charm and more unfemininity to the Bond series than Dame Judi Dench. Mads Mikkelsen Le Chiffre. In Ian Fleming's novel Le Chiffre is skillfully characterized as an odd sinister presence. On screen Mikkelsen's version of Le Chiffre is unimpressivean effete villain with a bloodweepy eye but without the twisted charisma that typifies the best Bond screen adversaries Goldfinger Blofeld Mr. Big Max Zorin Janus et al.3 Scriptdialogue. Both in content and tone the screenplaylike the noveloverwhelmingly projects malevolence the power of evil the stress on the tragic and traumatic all events taking place in a world where no one can or ought to be trusted.

Instead they bring 007 back to the beginning of his secret service careerin his most unflattering incarnation yet. Out go Bond's trademark charm and conviction. The new Bond is an uninteresting expressionless musclebound nihilist and a disgustingly vulnerable hero. The producers deliberately emphasize Bond's vulnerability by subjecting him incredibly to cardiac arrest! as well as a horrific trial of torture this latter was a rotten graphic part of Fleming's original novel. Putting obstacles in a purposeful screen hero's path makes for good drama but these shocking CasinoRoyale examples are an extremely sick way to challenge a hero and are certainly artistically unworthy of depiction on screen.Considering all these points it is clear that Casino Royale is neither valuedriven art nor uplifting entertainment.

	schema:headline " what was that about?";
	schema:reviewBody "I am not the biggest James Bond fan but I have quite enjoyed the franchise. Until now. There are so many things in this film that do not make sense that I don't know where to begin.First of all I am convinced that Daniel Craig had a hangover one day one of many judging by his face and was offered a role in the movie called Casino Royale about which he most certainly thought that it is a sequel to his well made Layer Cake for which he would be perfect. A successful cocaine dealer working his way to be England's Mafia elite will suit him much better than the British suave top spy. The phrase The men want to be him and the women want to be with him does not match the criteria. I could not help but laugh seeing him emerging from the water with his egg shaped head the sticking out trans illuminating ears and the straw organized hair. I definitely did not want to be him. Only thing to redirect the concentration of a movie goer to something else was to put him in the gym for six months prior to the shooting of the movie.Second of all I went to see this movie with a bit of objectivity listening to critics saying that it is a very well made action movie. I probably went to see the wrong film. The only exiting action sequence is the freerunning chase through the streets in Uganda. It involved the free running champion Sebastien Foucan where Craig's stunt was trying his best not to ruin the scene. Otherwise there are no new ideas no new camera angles and most of the scenes have been in the other movies before. The petrol tank truck chase on the airport runway is like a bad copy from the Raiders of the Lost ark. Harrison did a much better job and it was original.The sequence where Bond is mistaken for a parking attendant is the only ray of bright witty humor Bond is supposed to have and is missing and again it was used in the movies so many times before. The latest I remember by Vin Diesel in XXX The whole scene was badly executed and with no follow up logic. Why would security guys run towards the car to find out what has happened when there are security cameras in the security room which was left open for Bond to use the equipment??? Don't even let me start on the car chase. Sorry what car chase? Bond goes around a couple of curves and unintentionally when was the last time Bond unintentionally? wrecks the car. Yes he is a great actor just watch his facial expression before the stunt man breaks the world record in car flipping. Unforgettable.Editing of the poker games in the casino is just amateurish. Cutting the fight scene in half to add a dialog from different surroundings just for the viewer to find out that Mr. Bond has changed his shirt is called home made editing.Making the movie about the beginnings of James Bond earning his 00 status? You start with a black and white scene which really gives you an impression about the times before it all started. Good. You pick a 38 year old actor who looks used. Bad. You give him no gadgets. Good. Except latest satellite navigation telephones and a high tech heart defibrillator which is a standard accessory of his latest model Aston Martin by the way Mrs. Broccoli did you really think that invisible car previously was unrealistic?. Bad. Now you have a top spy so you give him an anti terrorist mission. Good. His task is to recover a mere 150 million. Bad. Can someone add this up for me? In conclusion this film is an average movie without any pace or plot with no new action no leading actor or actress in that matter no plot and no meaning at all.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let's start by saying my three star rating of this film is an act of generosity on my part considering it isn't a bad action film has some exciting sequences and thrilling moments. But though Bond has been synonymous with action for over forty years the Bond movies have always been about more than that namely... fun. This film was almost completely devoid of any fun whatsoever leaving me with the feeling if you can't get a little fun from a Bond film any more what the hell kinda world are we living in?! I wasn't as sceptical of Daniel Craig as lots of people seemed to be knowing he is a fine actor but his total lack of charisma humour and charm left me hating his guts. Now people will claim but this is the closest to Ian Flemings original version of Bond that we've yet seen and that makes him a good Bond maybe even the best. But it's always been a clear and obvious fact that the Bond films have never had much in common with Flemming's novels except for the titles yet it has still become one of the most beloved film franchises of all time Obviously not beloved enough to stop them taking over forty years of tradition and mythology the one liners the gadgets the overthetop villains and their overthetop deathsand flushing it all down the friggin' toilet! Yes Die Another Day was a step too far in making things over the top  an invisible car being just one example  but that's no reason to just scrap the whole franchise in terms of what it represents.Like I said Bond films SHOULD be about having fun not leaving the cinema feeling horribly depressed and miserable. A James Bond who stares questioningly at himself in the mirror after killing a bad guy in a what am I turning into kinda way?! Screw that! Bond should kill a guy make a glib joke then look for the next scumbag that needs killin'. A Bond who falls in love then cries his eyes out when she dies? Even George Lazenby took the same thing with a little subtle dignity and they'd just got married! And please consider this  can you imagine Roger Moore Connery or even Dalton strapped to a chair naked getting their balls smashed to pieces screaming their head off like a lunatic? No because that... is... NOT... FUN!!! There was a brief glimmer of hope when Craig returns from the near death poisoning experience to the poker table and says sorry about that that last hand nearly killed me. I thought hooray James Bond actually made a joke! Only took him a fing HOUR!!!! By the time the end credits start to roll and the Monty Norman theme finally starts to play it almost seems like a cruel joke of some kind so far removed is the preceding 140 minutes from what the world has come to recognise as true Bond. Yet everyone seems to love it people the world over lapping Casino Royale up like cream from a spy's battered testicles. I guess fun is officially dead along with the Bond we all grew up with. I certainly shall miss him.".

Little thought is ever given to emotional connection spirituality or nondominating forms of conflict resolution the dominant social paradigm is always vindicated and reasserted Bond always wins often through highly unethical means all the women he seeks are conquered the traitorous woman is always killed and a Victorian mentality of society being strictly hierarchical mechanistic and controlled from the top by an inherited nobility is always served up.And of course the narrative structures of all the Bond movies are the same we have the titillative prestory action sequence the revelation of the mission the journey to the exotic location the meeting with the first woman the introduction of the sub villain the mid point action sequences the introduction of the second woman the capture of Bond by the central villain the escape of Bond and the climactic action sequence often in which the bad guy is killed. Added to this mix is the usual sprinkling of black tie functions high stakes gambles card games exotic locations gunplay dangerous car chases etc.And as most action movies are reliant on the technology and conventions of the time in which they were made and as the pace of these films is constantly increasing most Bond films have a shelf life of about 3 years each film looking dated by the time the other arrives.Of course most action movies adhere to this formula the Indiana Jones flicks follow it to a tee  this is because our cultural narrative structure is shaped strongly around the pattern of the male sexual experience setup building tension climax then resolution  but the Bond movies have been religiously following their own template and replicating whole sequences for almost six decades.

Incidentally the director of this film Martin Campbell rebooted Bond in the early 90s with Goldeneye just as director Guy Hamilton twice rebooted Bond in the 60s and 70s. Worth one viewing.";

Perhaps due to my high hopes for the film and the many positive reviews? And yet it seems beyond my personal expectations. The film tried too hard to be different the end result being an entirely different Bond film but a very unoriginal Hollywoodised action flick.Yes Craig gave a tougher more brutal edge to Bond but what Hollywood action hero isn't tough and brutal? In fact it was the desire for Hollywood action that ruined this film for me.For example the scene containing free running parkour near the beginning epitomises the desire for great action and little sense. If you recall there is a moment where Bond decides to climb into some sort of demolition vehicle. Yes it looked great as the vehicle came crashing through a concrete wall but if we actually think about it there was no need whatsoever? It did not achieve anything not just in terms of film artistry but also plot  it didn't help him catch the bad guy!The free running itself was another attempt by the director to wow the audience into submission there was quite literally no point to it whatsoever. Why on earth did the villain decide to go up a crane?  I know I can escape him by climbing to the top of a crane  No my friend you would have been better off finding yourself a car. I am not surprised this film has been received well and that it is a hit at the box office  but I'm sorry Mr.Campbell I see through you.I will openly admit I found the poker scenes enjoyable and I found Mads Mikklesen's performance particularly enjoyable. Not a bad effort and it does indeed breathe new life into the Bond genre but I could quite easily go down to Blockbuster search the action section for 5 minutes and find something just as good! Ultimately what I found offensive about this film was that all involved seemed to believe that if they throw a load of heavy duty action scenes at the audience to satisfy us  not this film goer I'm afraid.. 510".

From what I know of film editing it could well have been filmed 75 years ago. A great piece of history with great music and very sweet story. The story begins pretty much at the point where an attractive young woman is going down to the river along with a congregation of Christians to be baptized. We learn a little bit about her from a couple members of the congregation gossiping with one another talking about how her husband of 3 years or 3 months  can't remember went hunting rather than coming to attend her baptism. We soon learn too after the newly baptized woman returns home that her husband is also a poacher if that is the right word. The woman makes an appeal to her husband to get religion explaining that it will make them much happier. Then it starts getting interesting...Two thumbs up!!! One more note about the music and singing Fantastic! Reminds me of the kind of 78 rpm records many collectors love to listen to needle scratches and all. You just can't get this kind of music today generally. This is a film I am bound to want to watch again and again just to hear the music and singing. I also believe and know from my own experience that the Blood of Jesus is indeed a powerful ally in this world currently still under the administration of the Adversary  so I love the message too even if it does serve a lot of corn with some serious gospel.".

It was written and directed by Spencer Williams 18931969 who also is featured as the husband of a woman Cathryn Caviness undergoing a spiritual challenge.Williams is best known for playing Andy in the wonderful Amos and Andy TV series 19513 but his work as a major star and director of race films has been largely forgotten. Williams appeared in dozens of films from 1928 through 1947 and directed 12 films including this one. The film was made with a 5000 budget provided by Williams. The actors are nonprofessionals many of them taken from a local church group the Reverend Robinson's Heavenly Choir. The story is taken from Southern Baptist folk lore and centers on the struggle for the soul of Cathryn Caviness who lies dying after being accidentally shot by Williams. Caviness' soul is tempted by an overthetop Satan Jas. B. Jones while a sweet angel Rogenia Goldthwaite tries to keep her on the moral road.There are a few special effects but generally the acting and photography are what you'd expect with a 5000 budget. What makes the film valuable is the anthropological value of watching life for Southern Blacks  their music their dance joints their belief systems their language etc. We even get to observe a baptism. In 1991 the film was selected as part of the Library of Congress National Film Registry.".

However before she can choose the Devil shows up with his assistant named Judas to try and steer her the wrong way. This film was made on a budget lower than 5000 and you can really tell because the film features some of the worst acting I've ever seen. We're talking an Ed Wood level here as there are several moments where the actors flub their lines struggle to remember them and then finally deliver them. The film tells an interesting story but the actual story only lasts for about ten minutes and the rest of the time we just watch people standing around the woman praying.

He'd played in many black productions before this and with The Blood of Jesus he wrote directed and played the male lead! Now' I will admit the writing wasn't great but his direction considering the budget was excellent as he and the cinematographer used some wonderful camera tricks to make the film look good for a supercheapo production.The film is the story about a Christian woman who is accidentally shot by her husband. While she appears to be dead and her friends are VERY quick to pronounce her that way she actually is on a journey a lot like Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress. The Devil and his helper Judas try to convince the woman to stray from the path to Heaven through the evil and dreaded nightclub! Well okay I'll admit this is pretty lameand so it most of the film. But I still liked it for the doubleexposures view of the Pearly Gates and its value as a historical artifact. The history teacher in me liked this aspect though I am sure most will find it all very ponderous and bad. Worth a look for a select audience as black cinema from this era has been mostly forgotten.The bottom line is that it would be very easy to pick out what's bad about the film though I challenge the viewer to put this in its historical context and recognize that for what it is it has some value...some.".

	schema:reviewBody "Encino Man is a comedy influenced by the wackiness of the grunge generation. The young cast which stars Astin Shore and Fraser is likely to be a major draw for teenagers and younger viewers who will likely enjoy this movie. The story is pretty goofy. Dave Sean Astin has major plans for putting a swimming pool in his backyard to at least get some popularity points with the neighborhood teens who could lounge by the water in the blazing California summer sun. But when he's breaking ground he digs up a block of ice with a casualty of the Ice Ages primitive fellow who he and his hip buddy Stoney Pauley Shore clean off and try to disguise him as a regular American teenager. Needless to say a lot of mishaps arise out of this. But eventually the grizzly Link Fraser is a pretty popular kid at the high school and one that Dave thinks will help him get popular too in that popularitybyassociation kind of way. Matt Wilson a jerky jock Michael DeLuise interferes with Dave's plans to just try and pass off Link as a normal exchange student. Already ped with Dave and Stoney for getting friendly with his girlfriend Robyn Megan Ward and with their increasing popularityespecially Link who Robyn has a little crush on. Matt figures out Link's real identity and it's a question of whether anyone will believe his story that Link is really from the Ice Ages. Not even the school's most popular jerk can get off easy with a line like that.The cast and this silly story make it an enjoyable comedy. Teens are likely to enjoy Pauley Shore's scenes as the happygolucky hippie throwback friend Stoney as he just seems like such a nice giant goofball who can really have fun with this material. It's also pretty funny to watch a fellow from the Ice Age trying to adapt to modern teenage life much like the historical dudes did in Bill  Ted's Excellent Adventure. It's even got some sweet tunes on the soundtrack. So loosen up and enjoy it already.".

Also you need those comedies that you can just sit down too and just have fun and relax. Yes it has Pauly Shore which granted can be scareE! D But he's actually amusing as well in the film.We see a very young Brendon Fraser as Link the caveman yes he doesn't have much to work with the grunting and such. But he was just priceless in that club scene and the seven eleven with Pauly. He's also just so cute and lovable when he sees Dave and Stoney getting into a fight and he pulls David back screaming to him Family!. It was actually touching I'm serious. Sean Austin plays Dave he's come such a long way and in my opinion is the most successful child star to not get hooked on drugs or let the industry take him over. He does such a good job as the pretty self centered and insecure but nevertheless lovable guy who wants to get the girl. Pauly plays Stoney a well I think he's somewhat of a stoner. D But he's pretty funny in the film with some of his lines. Come on I think we all dug him in his day.While yes Encino Man is not Oscar material it's just a fun time to sit down and enjoy with your friends. So a 5.0? It's just a movie let go and grab the popcorn for a few laughs. If you didn't laugh at that scene where Link speaks Spanish to the Hispanic gang members you have some serious issues.710".

It's intended purely as entertainment and that's what it is.It appears to have been promoted as one of those frightful Pauly Shore movies but it's not. He's really just a supporting player and is nowhere near as annoying in small doses it turns out. This is Brendan Fraser's flick. If anyone else had played Link I can't imagine the movie being as good as it is.My one beef is that Sandra Hess Cave Nug wasn't given enough screen time but then as far as I'm concerned she's NEVER given enough screen time.I never knew Scatterbrain had covered Mama Said Knock You Out either.

Also the premise of highschool kids finding a thawedup cromagnon man and becoming friends with him didn't bide well so I kind of watched this out of completism and deeprooted cinematic masochism. Turns out I was way off the mark. Encino Man is thoroughly enjoyable and one of the best movies of its genre. And Pauly Shore is my god now he really made this movie. Well he may be a onetrickcomedian but at least at he's the godfather of this one trick. The stonersurferdude has been done ad nauseam in highschool comedies but Pauly Shore is the stonersurferdude to rule all other stonersurferdudes. His figure is not just funny and dudeish but also eccentric and frail almost a bit camp. When I read that he comes from a family of comedians I wasn't surprised. I see a lot of comedic and dramatic talent in him and it's a shame that he seems to have fallen out of favour recently.Anyway the movie. Luckily the pretty goofy plot doesn't put it in harm's way. Two likable social dropouts find a stone age survivor in their back yard and decide to smuggle him into their school in order to heighten their own peer standing. This goes terribly awry when the hunky prehuman becomes a hit with the ladies. Man seems to be set in atavistic struggle against prehuman and stoner dude but luckily they eventually find their moral bearings the humans learn the benefits of sticking together from their thawedout friend and the cromagnon learns to go halfies on his microwave burrito.Like I said I really enjoyed Pauly Shore here. He made this movie. The other actors are also good there's great dialogue and the babes are babealicious. I also enjoyed the fact that the underdogs were the protagonists here.To give you a ballpark comparison it's au pair with Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Yes it's that good buuuhdy.".

You will see how they evolve 'Link' into a somewhat normal student and how Link befriends almost everyone in the school.Of course you have the 'jock' who is determined to upset it all and bring 'link' down. Not only is it funny but you also have a little suspense  do they get caught or do they pull this whole farce off and get the girl? Am I going to tell you? No you need to get the movie and have a laugh.Great movie which I enjoy watching and seeing my 9 yr old laugh over also.".

The idea that a CroMagnon could become the coolest kid in school is hilarious probably because it's almost believable.Future hobbit Sean Astin plays Dave Morgan a high school senior. Dave is the most unpopular kid in school and is inevitably in love with the most popular Robyn Sweeney Megan Ward who once upon a time was childhood playmate to Dave Dave even has a baby picture of the two naked in a bathtub but now while still good hearted has fallen in with the 'popular' crowd and is inevitably dating the biggest ahole at school Matt Wilson Michael DeLuise a bully who puts down Dave's shy advances toward Robyn with a headlock and a sardonic 'Shoosh!' When he's not pining for Robyn Dave hangs out with his one and only friend and fellow loser Stoney played with his usual flamboyance by Pauly Shore. Stoney while as unpopular as Dave seems content with his status at the school. He dresses in ostracizing hippierags sure to turn a few of the girls away at school but is mellow and speaks in the Pauleneese tongue created by himself and screenwriter Shawn Scheppes. Dave however is far from happy and is determined to score coolness immortality not to mention the heart of Robyn before graduation. As the movie begins Dave is digging a giant dirt hole for an inground swimming pool which will be the centerpiece for the legendary party he will throw on prom night thus lifting him to the top of the social ladder. One hot California day while digging Dave hits something hard and cold with his shovel. Enter the Encino Man.Brendan Frazier never ceases to amaze me obviously a gifted actor see 'Gods and Monsters' he nevertheless chooses zany comedic roles be it 'Blast From the Past' 'Bedazzled' or this the all share a quirky oddball role for Frazier to try in this case with positive results.Dave plans to exploit 'Link' not for money but for popularity. He tells Robyn his discovery but of course she doesn't believe him. Soon Link is enrolled in school under the rouse that he is an exchange student from Estonia. He cannot read write or speak other than grunts and the occasional Pauleneese term which themselves are not paragons of the English language. He swings on lamps and jumps on desks. He eats flies and will stare unashamedly at a pair of female 'gozangas' with the primal urges he cannot suppress like the rest of us. He is an animalnaturally he becomes the most coolest kid in school. I won't give away the rest of the plot suffice to say a Yes the bully will fall head first into a giant cake and b Yes there is an inexplicably choreographed dance number at the end.For all its silliness this is one great film. The actors go balls out into their characters as if unafraid of any damage they could do to their careers. They seem to be having so much fun as the cavemanthe normal guythe bullyPauly Shore that we don't have the heart to not have fun with them. Best of all this film sidesteps exhausted plot points that could have easily sneaked banality into it. There is no team of scientists trying to capture and experiment on Link and he is not conveniently disposed of for a return to normalcy. Instead we are treated to a rather original mixing of absurdity humor almost in the vein of Samuel Beckett or Robert Shaw where not only could a caveman blend in with society he can become cool. There is a strong moral in the film of individuality and what really is 'cool.' Robyn takes a strong liking to Link because he's the only guy at school who's not inhibited. She takes this as a sign of self confidence when it really is ignorance Link simply hasn't developed the ego and superego the rest of us haveand we truly envy him for this for his blissful unawareness of peer pressure. Although Dave tried to teach Link how to behave in society it was Link in the end who taught Dave just that.".

This film was the largest pile of steaming garbage I have ever witnessed. It was so ramblingly incoherent that I could not turn it off. My roommate who had recently smoked marijuana still did not understand the movie. I don't know how a caveman would even stay thawed for that long especially since ice does not even preserve people. It didn't even work for Ted Williams. This caveman learned some language and it was unrealistic. How did he learn a line dance? Pauly Shore is by far the worst actor ever to act and Sean Astin should seriously stick to Rudy. I award this movie zero points and may God have mercy on its soul.".

	schema:reviewBody "Encino Man is just an all around fun silly movie with some good comedy and numerous quotable lines.  The story behind Encino Man is very simple it's about two friends that find a frozen caveman in their backyard while trying to dig a pool...then the caveman wakes up from his frozen slumber.  Yeah it's a silly plot but it's all in good fun.The characters in the film are great as is the acting on all accounts. Brendan Fraser plays the title role of Link.  Brendan has very few actual lines in the film mostly just grunts and sounds...but nonetheless he does a fantastic job with the role. Sean Astin plays Dave Morgan the main character who desperately wants to be popular but has yet to be discovered.  Stoney Dave's best friend is played by Pauly Shore a guy who is content with himself and really doesn't care for popularity.  Megan Ward is Dave's love interest in the film and looks nothing short of fantastic throughout the film.  And finally there's Michael DeLuise as the antagonist Matt Dave's archrival. There's also a few notable supporting castmembers.  Robin Tunney Vertical Limit Empire Records End of Days in one of her first roles Patrick Van Horn Swingers Jonathan Ke Quan The Goonies Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom Rose McGowan Phantoms Scream Monkeybone Ready to Rumble and Jack Noseworthy Breakdown U 571 Event Horizon all fantastic actors rolled into one comedy.All in all this is a great film.  The cast is great the characters and acting are great and the story is silly but good at the same time.  There's even a few somewhat touching scenes here and there.  If you like any of the actors mentioned above be sure to check this film out or if you just enjoy a good silly comedy this is the one for you.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.  Thanks for readingLebowskiT1000".

There are a few scenes where Pauley Shore actually tries to act managing to evoke sparks of true emotion but otherwise Encino Man was kind of a yawnfest especially compared to something like Airheads also with Brandan Fraser which is really really funny.

When her father is reported dead and their fortune is wiped out the friendly headmistress becomes notsofriendly towards Sarah who is made to work off her father's debt to the school.  Sarah is convinced that her father is alive though and searches the area hospital for him eventually finding him.This movie serves as an excellent example of several things movies like this just aren't made any more.  Unfortunately they can't be  people would say it was too corny.  In the movie Shirley portrays a child not only with unshakable hope but patience manners politeness and kindness in the face of terrible adversity with only a couple of cracks in her steadfastness. She meets Queen Victoria.  Who would believe that a child under the duress that she suffers could be so gracious? Who would believe that being a pauper she could meet the Queen of England?  Today's movie child star would have filled the air with sassiness and expletives under the same situation. But ShirleySarah doesn't and that's a reason that I really like this movie  it shows someone who tries to make the best of a bad situation and never gives up hope.I also believe that the movie is an accurate portrayal of the life and times of the turn of the century as it was made only 40 years after the Boer War. I think that Victorian England was captured well in this movie after all we do a pretty good job of displaying the 1960s on film these days.Overall though it is Shirley Temple at her singingdancingacting best in this movie and she does a wonderful job from start to finish.".

But ShirleySarah doesn't and that's a reason that I really like this movie  it shows someone who tries to make the best of a bad situation and never gives up hope.I also believe that the movie is an accurate portrayal of the life and times of the turn of the century as it was made only 40 years after the Boer War. I think that Victorian England was captured well in this movie after all we do a pretty good job of displaying the 1960s on film these days.Overall though it is Shirley Temple at her singingdancingacting best in this movie and she does a wonderful job from start to finish.";

Although the Hollywood film industry has always come under some welldeserved criticism for twisting history and other literary sources in its screenplays they do get it right at times.

	schema:reviewBody "This Shirley Temple feature is worth seeing for a number of very nice moments in the story of The Little Princess. It might be a little longer than necessary and the story development is sometimes uneven which keeps it from achieving its full potential. It offers the young Temple a variety of material to work with and she has some very good sequences.For the most part it follows the familiar story though often embellished particularly towards the end. The story and Temple's characterization give it a rather different feel from for example the silent version that starred Mary Pickford. Here Temple projects much of her own persona with her best moments coming with Arthur Treacher who plays the easygoing brother of the stern headmistress. The character of Becky is still significant but Temple does not ever have the rapport with her that Pickford and Zasu Pitts had in the earlier version.As a result it's a bit uneven overall but for those who enjoy this kind of story it's still worthwhile. The public domain print makes it somewhat difficult to evaluate the production end although it clearly contained plenty of detail and color. It's a decent if unexceptional feature whose high points are usually worth waiting for.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE LITTLE PRINCESS 20th CenturyFox 1939 directed by Walter Lang based upon the story by Frances Hodgeson Burnett ranks one of Shirley Temple's best known and most revived feature as well as her first in Technicolor. Capitalizing on her previous success with screen adaptations to literary children's novels including HEIDI and WEE WILLIE WINKIE both 1937 THE LITTLE PRINCESS displays Temple's talent in heavy dramatics at best especially with her two key scenes one in which she tearyeyed bids goodbye to her father as he goes off to war and another where she stands firm looking angrily straight at her evil boarding school mistress as she is about to slap her face for standing up to her. Like a fairy tale this production includes good characters along with a wicked one wonderfully played by Mary Nash along with some dialog usually found in storybooks such as one little girl saying on how Sara Crewe Temple looks just like a princess with the overly jealous girl sarcastically responding Princess INDEED.Set in London in the year 1899 Sara Shirley Temple is the daughter of her widowed father Captain Crewe Ian Hunter who leaves her in a boarding school under the care of Miss Amanda Mirchin Mary Nash and her brother Bertie Arthur Treacher a former music hall performer before he goes off to the Boer War. Because Crewe is a well known figure and man of wealth Sara is given the royalty treatment as if she were a little princess causing jealously amongst one of the other girls Lavinia Marcia Mae Jones who doesn't want to lose her place with Miss Mirchin. After Miss Mirchin receives news from Mr. Babbows E.E. Clive that Captain Crewe has been killed in the war leaving daughter Sara penniless she at first decides to put Sara and her belongings into the street but Babbows advises her that this would not look good for her or the school. So the only other alternative is to place Sara from her luxurious room into a cold attic taking her expensive clothing and auctioning it off to pay for her lodging leaving Sara with only paupers' clothes to wear. In order to earn her keep Sara must work long hard hours in the kitchen along with another girl Becky Sybil Jason who befriends her. Being treated harshly Sara becomes a hard and bitter child who tries to be a good soldier as her father had wanted her to be but finds she's unable to do it being at times both hungry and cold. Not wanting to believe her father is dead Sara braves the streets of London at night in hope to one day find him amongst the wounded in the military hospital.Also in support in THE LITTLE PRINCESS are Richard Greene and Anita Louise as the young romantic couple with Louise as Miss Rose an employee of the boarding school who loses her position for secretly meeting with Sir Geoffrey Hamilton Greene against the wishes of Miss Minchin Cesar Romero as Ram Dass an Arab servant to Lord Wickham Miles Mander Sir Geoffrey's grandfather Eily Malyon as an unsympathetic boarding school cook and Beryl Mercer as Queen Victoria among others. Aside from the heavy handled dramatics that resembles a dark Charles Dickens novel THE LITTLE PRINCESS does take time for some song and dance including Down By the Old Kent Road by Arthur Chevalier and Charles Ingle as sung and danced by Shirley Temple and Arthur Treacher and as with Temple's earlier classic HEIDI there's a musical dream sequence this one titled Fantasy by Walter Bullock and Samuel Pokrass.As with HEIDI THE LITTLE PRINCESS is prestigious Temple production. It also reunites her with her HEIDI costars Mary Nash Arthur Treacher and Marcia Mae Jones. And also like HEIDI THE LITTLE PRINCESS gives the impression of a hurried conclusion. Mary Nash gives a standout performance with her female interpretation of Mr. Murdstone from Dickens' novel David COPPERFIELD with Treacher a likable Micawber character from that very same novel. Temple and Treacher have fine screen chemistry with this being their fourth and final collaboration together. The 1899 London period setting is wonderfully captured along with its lavish crisp Technicolor. Sybil Jason a promising young child actress of Warner Brothers 193538 who didn't rise above the rank of Temple is quite memorable playing the cockney orphan Becky. Her performance is unlike anything she has done before but sadly after one more film THE BLUE BIRD 1940 which also starred Temple Jason's career would come to an end.Unlike the other Shirley Temple movies of the 1930s THE LITTLE PRINCESS became a public domain video title being distributed through various video companies through the years 1980s and 1990s and like the Christmas classic IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE 1946 which also fell victim to public domain THE LITTLE PRINCESS became frequently shown on numerous television stations at any given time. The 1989 CBS Fox Home Video presentation of THE LITTLE PRINCESS does present this film with the best Technicolor print available outdoing some others with duller looking copies. THE LITTLE PRINCESS was formerly presented on cable television's American Movie Classics from 1996 to 2001 and occasionally airs on Turner Classic Movies and on the Fox Movie Channel. Wherever THE LITTLE PRINCESS is found it makes good family viewing. One final note the Frances Hodgeson Burnett classic included a 1917 silent film version starring Mary Pickford and a 1995 remake with Eleanor Bron both titled A LITTLE PRINCESS. But whenever THE LITTLE PRINCESS is mentioned it'll be no doubt that the Shirley Temple version will be the one that comes to mind. ".

	schema:reviewBody "Between the ages of 7 and 10 little Shirley Temple was the biggest box office star in the world. But as she grew older her popularity quickly began to wane. At 11 though she believed herself to be 10 because her mother shaved a year off her age Shirley was still quite a child when she made The Little Princess. But because she was no longer as cute and cherubic as she was at 6 when Stand Up and Cheer! first made her a star it was to be her last successful film in a children's role.As Sara a Hebrew name meaning princess Shirley plays her standard ragstoriches storyline in reverse Sara's wealthy widowed father loses everything in the Boer War and her cruel boarding school headmistress Miss Minchin makes her an underfed overworked servant girl to pay the tuition debt her father owed. Sara goes from luxurious rooms and private tutors to friendless freezing attics as suddenly as the swinging America of the 1920s sank into the dust storms breadlines and squattervilles of the 1930's Great Depression. But where did poor Americans turn to briefly forget all these problems during the Great Depression? To the movies where Shirley Temple her unwavering hopefulness as present in The Little Princess as in any of her movies and her cute songanddance numbers  with titles like Laugh You Son of a Gun 1934 You Gotta Smile to be Happy 1936 Be Optimistic 1938 and Come and Get Your Happiness 1938  cheered up the entire nation. The same singing and dancing cheers up Sara Crewe while she's working as a galley slave in 1899 London as Shirley performs The Old Kent Road with her pal Arthur Treacher her fourtime costar.In short The Little Princess is Shirley Temple's career in a nutshell. It is a mustsee film for both longtime Shirley fans and newcomers.".

But because she was no longer as cute and cherubic as she was at 6 when Stand Up and Cheer! first made her a star it was to be her last successful film in a children's role.As Sara a Hebrew name meaning princess Shirley plays her standard ragstoriches storyline in reverse Sara's wealthy widowed father loses everything in the Boer War and her cruel boarding school headmistress Miss Minchin makes her an underfed overworked servant girl to pay the tuition debt her father owed. Sara goes from luxurious rooms and private tutors to friendless freezing attics as suddenly as the swinging America of the 1920s sank into the dust storms breadlines and squattervilles of the 1930's Great Depression. But where did poor Americans turn to briefly forget all these problems during the Great Depression? To the movies where Shirley Temple her unwavering hopefulness as present in The Little Princess as in any of her movies and her cute songanddance numbers  with titles like Laugh You Son of a Gun 1934 You Gotta Smile to be Happy 1936 Be Optimistic 1938 and Come and Get Your Happiness 1938  cheered up the entire nation. The same singing and dancing cheers up Sara Crewe while she's working as a galley slave in 1899 London as Shirley performs The Old Kent Road with her pal Arthur Treacher her fourtime costar.In short The Little Princess is Shirley Temple's career in a nutshell. It is a mustsee film for both longtime Shirley fans and newcomers.";

	schema:reviewBody "There are those who claim Shirley Temple couldn't really actbut The Little Princess is living proof that she was much more than just a dimpled tot who could sing and dance on cue. Her tearful reunion with her missing dad Ian Hunter in a hospital ward at the conclusion of this classic story should move even the most hardened cynic. Her tears range from joy to hysteria as she tries to tell the shellshocked soldier that she is his daughter.This is a lavish technicolor delight with Shirley Temple at 12 doing an expert job as Sara the little miss who has to bear the indignities of a boarding school once her father has been declared dead in the Boer war. The harsh mistress Mary Nash has her stripped of all privileges and makes her live in the attic while becoming a servant in the very household where she was once called the little princess by the other girls. There are departures from the novel since the script is given a Shirley Temple formula to ensure its success as the right vehicle for her at that time. But the addition of a dream sequence does no discernible harm nor is the brief songanddance with Arthur Treacher to The Old Kent Road much of a distraction. It succeeds in being a heartwarming tale of a girl's courage and determination when it seems that there is no hope of finding her father alive. The ending with Queen Victoria giving  Shirley an approving nod is an added delight. One of Shirley's best performances with a wonderful cast of supporting players Richard Greene Anita Louise Mary Nash Sybil Jason Arthur Treacher and Cesar Romero all doing expert work.".

	schema:headline " This movie treat its audience with royalty. Indeed Shirley Temple was a real little princess!";
	schema:reviewBody "Based on the 1905 novel 'A Little Princess being the whole story of Sara Crewe' by Frances Hodgson Burnett. The Little Princess was a pretty good adapted movie. I wouldn't say it's the best adaption of the novel because it's far from that. In my opinion the film should had been title 'The Soldier's Daughter' because how different it was with the novel. Directed by Walter Lang the movie is about 12 year old Sara Crewe Shirley Temple whom father Captain Crewe Ian Hunter is called to fight in the Second Boer War. Sara is left behind in the care of Amanda Minchin Mary Nash the head of an exclusive private school for girls where she lives in a princess like lifestyle due to her father's riches. Her life as a princess wasn't long as Captain Crewe's money dry up and her father is believe to be dead in the battlefield. Miss Minchin harshly force the young woman to serve under her making her life miserable. This doesn't stop Sara's will power and belief that her father isn't dead and she do anything to find out if he's still alive. Although it maintained the novel's Victorian London setting the film introduced several new characters like Richard Greene and Anita Louise as the young romantic couple Sir Geoffrey Hamilton  Miss Rose. They're employees of the boarding school whom go against the wishes of Miss Minchin. Then there is meanspirited Lord Wickham Miles Mander who has Ram Dass Cesar Romero as an Indian servant under him. It isn't really explained why he has an Indian lascar for a servant and there is no logical explanation for why he would want to redecorate Sara's garret room. I guess having an Indian sailor next room seem too unrealistic in Victoria Era England to the filmmakers. Another character added is Hubert Arthur Treacher who became friends with Sara over music. One thing way different than the novel is the musical number. I know a lot of Shirley Temple's previous films had this but this movie lacks music and songs good enough to remember. Shirley Temple and Arthur Treacher had a musical number together performing the song Knocked 'Em in the Old Kent Road which was way too short. Temple also appeared in an extended ballet dream sequence that was a bit distracting from the main plot. The whole dream scene was just awful and felt like filler. Another big change is the storyline. The movie used the Second Boer War and the Siege of Mafeking as a backdrop. In the book the father was just visiting India and got ill to the point he got brain fever. It wasn't war. The film covers only a timeline of a year while the book go nearly four years. One of the biggest change in the film is the ending. The film's ending was drastically different. Without spoiling too much of it this adaptation changes the fate of Captain Crewe. In my opinion it's a better ending than the book. Still it's does kinda mess up the plot of a young adult learning how to deal with death and to better herself through the actions of her own wellbeing. I just didn't like the whole Queen Victoria cameo helping her find her father. It was just outlandish  unrealistic. I can do without all the over Patriotism oozes out of every scene of the film. The main film is about this girl trying to reunite with her father not the Boer War. Second off there is no Mr. Thomas Carrisford character in the film. The acting in the film were pretty alright but nobody really stood out. Shirley looked a little old for the part but she pulls it off. At the part when she was by the window crying to say goodbye to her daddy was emotional. It was nice to see her react in a film to things like loss and death in a story. The trouble is she can't pull off the emotion of making herself cry. In the movie Shirley portrays a child not only with steadfast hope but patience manners politeness and kindness in the face of appalling adversity that you rarely see in film today. Who would believe that a child under that pressure could be so gracious? I love when Shirley as Sarah does snap back against her bullies like taunting from Lavinia Marcia Mae Jones. I have to say if the film was little bit more dark it would had work better. It remind me of a Charles Dicken's novel. The director did good on keeping his camera low down at a child's eyelevel. Also striking is his use of multiple angles which really gives dimension to the sets or highlighting a sudden change in mood. This movie was the first Shirley Temple movie to be filmed completely in Technicolor as before that producers believe these incredibly bright lights produced so much heat that a child Temple's age would be hurt working under such conditions. Sadly this was her last major success as a child star. The film is easy to find since it's in the public domain due to the failure to renew its copyright registration. This means that virtually anyone could duplicate and sell a VHSDVD copy of the film. Therefore many of the versions of this film available on the market are either severely or usually badly edited. Some DVDs have really extremely poor quality having been duped from second or thirdgeneration or more copies of the film. So watch out for that. There are countless remakes of the novel since then. In my opinion 1995's A Little Princess directed by Alfonso Cuaron was a bit better one than this but this Little Princess is widely considered to be one of Shirley Temple's best film and I have to agree. Enjoyable tale for children and adults alike. So check it out.".

	onyx:emotionText "Based on the 1905 novel 'A Little Princess being the whole story of Sara Crewe' by Frances Hodgson Burnett. The Little Princess was a pretty good adapted movie. I wouldn't say it's the best adaption of the novel because it's far from that. In my opinion the film should had been title 'The Soldier's Daughter' because how different it was with the novel. Directed by Walter Lang the movie is about 12 year old Sara Crewe Shirley Temple whom father Captain Crewe Ian Hunter is called to fight in the Second Boer War. Sara is left behind in the care of Amanda Minchin Mary Nash the head of an exclusive private school for girls where she lives in a princess like lifestyle due to her father's riches. Her life as a princess wasn't long as Captain Crewe's money dry up and her father is believe to be dead in the battlefield. Miss Minchin harshly force the young woman to serve under her making her life miserable. This doesn't stop Sara's will power and belief that her father isn't dead and she do anything to find out if he's still alive. Although it maintained the novel's Victorian London setting the film introduced several new characters like Richard Greene and Anita Louise as the young romantic couple Sir Geoffrey Hamilton  Miss Rose. They're employees of the boarding school whom go against the wishes of Miss Minchin. Then there is meanspirited Lord Wickham Miles Mander who has Ram Dass Cesar Romero as an Indian servant under him. It isn't really explained why he has an Indian lascar for a servant and there is no logical explanation for why he would want to redecorate Sara's garret room. I guess having an Indian sailor next room seem too unrealistic in Victoria Era England to the filmmakers. Another character added is Hubert Arthur Treacher who became friends with Sara over music. One thing way different than the novel is the musical number. I know a lot of Shirley Temple's previous films had this but this movie lacks music and songs good enough to remember. Shirley Temple and Arthur Treacher had a musical number together performing the song Knocked 'Em in the Old Kent Road which was way too short. Temple also appeared in an extended ballet dream sequence that was a bit distracting from the main plot. The whole dream scene was just awful and felt like filler. Another big change is the storyline. The movie used the Second Boer War and the Siege of Mafeking as a backdrop. In the book the father was just visiting India and got ill to the point he got brain fever. It wasn't war. The film covers only a timeline of a year while the book go nearly four years. One of the biggest change in the film is the ending. The film's ending was drastically different. Without spoiling too much of it this adaptation changes the fate of Captain Crewe. In my opinion it's a better ending than the book. Still it's does kinda mess up the plot of a young adult learning how to deal with death and to better herself through the actions of her own wellbeing. I just didn't like the whole Queen Victoria cameo helping her find her father. It was just outlandish  unrealistic. I can do without all the over Patriotism oozes out of every scene of the film.

Some of it I could remember but a large chunk of it seemed to have slipped my memory. Still this was a family movie that still thrills me as a 20 year old.This movie stars Shirley Temple as a little girl whose father goes to war. She's sent to an allgirls boarding school where the teacher Ms. Minchin treats her very well since her father will pay her all costs that Sara his daughter will need. News hits that her father may possibly be dead and Sara goes on multiple searches to make sure that it is not true.This movie has a ton of fun moments including a dream Sara has where she's a princess and she has Ms. Minchin imprisoned for wanting 2 people in jail for kissing.This will make more sense when you see the movie.There are a few other moments that I would like to mention but I would rather have you see the movie yourself to experience them.But now I have to mention why this is a 9 and now I must spoil the end of the movie to an extent. I won't discuss the father thing but events surrounding it.When Ms. Minchin finds out that Captain Crewe is most likely dead she turns Sara into a house servant and treats her poorly to pay off what her father can't pay. When she messes up she gets a severe punishment.For example she breaks some glass and is forced to skip dinner when she has not had lunch either.When this happens Sara and her servant friend wake up and sees a huge breakfast that her neighbor friend gave her as she slept. Ms. Minchin walks in and sees all the food. She then accuses Sara of stealing all the food and leaves to inform the police.Does this woman really think that a little girl can steal all of the food that she received? And how would she sneak out of the house and get it in her room? Her room is in the area equivalent to an ATTIC!Also why didn't the neighbor write a note like I knew you were hungry so I brought you this food. ? Instead of helping Sara he actually made the situation worse for her!He helps her escape the police but he thinks it's a game the girls are playing just because that's what the girls tell him! Are you kidding me? Would he not realize that Sara may go to jail because of his stupid mistake?And here's my final flaw the neighbor knows that Sara is mistreated and neglected.Why doesn't he call the police and inform them of that? Ms. Minchin shouldn't be calling the police on Sara Sara or a friend should be calling the police on HER!I had all of these questions in a rough time span of about 10 minutes. That's why I am only removing one star from my rating. If the characters had thought about their intended actions good or bad before committing them the plot would have more coherent logic.However all things said and done The Little Princess is an enchanting live action family feature that is very much worth seeing. I'm giving this movie a 9 but it may very well be the best 9 movie that I have ever seen because of how entertaining it is!".

I don't know if The Little Princess might have been one of them but in any case she was always a favorite. Shirley may not have had all of the cuteness factor here that was on display in her earlier roles but there's no denying her talent and presence when she's on screen no one else matters. The story here turns somewhat morose when Sara Crewe Temple learns her father Ian Hunter dies in the Boer War. That's a tough thing to put a kid through young viewers that is not the actress. Relating too much to the possibility of a parent's dying isn't exactly the most cheerful subject so first time viewers of the film are left on the hook for a while until a more successful resolution is arrived at. Along with Shirley I was also rooting for her compatriot Sybil Jason as the poor young chambermaid who took a liking to Sara and had the feeling returned in good measure. Interestingly the Little Princess part of the story was brought into sharper focus when Shirley's character met Queen Victoria Beryl Mercer allowing the viewer to consider two different kinds of royalty.".

The story here turns somewhat morose when Sara Crewe Temple learns her father Ian Hunter dies in the Boer War. That's a tough thing to put a kid through young viewers that is not the actress. Relating too much to the possibility of a parent's dying isn't exactly the most cheerful subject so first time viewers of the film are left on the hook for a while until a more successful resolution is arrived at. Along with Shirley I was also rooting for her compatriot Sybil Jason as the poor young chambermaid who took a liking to Sara and had the feeling returned in good measure. Interestingly the Little Princess part of the story was brought into sharper focus when Shirley's character met Queen Victoria Beryl Mercer allowing the viewer to consider two different kinds of royalty.";

This was the kind of movie that teenagers with fake I.D.'s would go out to see at the driveins. For years mainstream cinema never offered up any skin and seeing the kinds of nudiecutie quickies from Russ Meyer Herschell Gordon Lewis and Doris Wishman certainly were a shock to the system. Today films like this are considered to be curiosity pieces. There is tons of nudity but very little else. No titillation no sexual situations and nothing explicit. Just a group of healthy beautiful people doing everyday things in the buff.Still the movie is a lot of fun to watch even though there seems to be so much tedium and is slow moving. The scenery is beautiful and you feel you are seeing what Heaven would look like in 1961. There are some fine looking women who always seem to be carrying around hats towels and magazines over the more controversial private parts. Also Davee Decker is quite lovely even though her voice is dubbed.If you long to see what an adult movie was like in the early days and can accept the fact that it is only nudity and nothing more then you will have some fun with this one. It airs occasionally on DriveIn Classics.".

To my mind that makes her a bit of a hero! What makes it more interesting to me is the fact that she looked like the typical young housewife of that era the lady next door that you would have borrowed a cup of sugar from. A fun little cult film not to be taken too seriously I'm really curious to find out if she is still alive and what made her do nudie movies when it was taboo at that time.".

Watching them cavort for the length of this movie is a pleasure but it's the only pleasure you'll get out of this lame duck.The nudity must have been racy in its day but today it's strictly PG. There's plenty of breasts and buttocks both male and female but none of the nasty bits. In fact all the nudists either cover their genitalia with some object  a newspaper a towel  or they deliberately turn their hips away from the camera as they walk by. At one point there's a volleyball game taking place the team with their backs to the camera is completely nude but the team facing it are all wearing swimsuit bottoms. It's pretty silly stuff but the charm lies in seeing such an abundant display of TA in such an old film.The plot if anyone actually cares concerns a female reporter going undercover at a nudist camp to gather material for an expose in some creepy guy's newspaper. She gets into it and becomes one of them so the creepy guy decides to go undercover as well to write an expose of his own. He eventually gets converted to the cause and never takes his trunks off the entire time. Oh and somehow they announce that they love each other at the end which comes completely out of nowhere it's ridiculous.This is an utterly cheesy yet slightly titillating flick.".

Back at his office he talks a female reporter into going to the camp and getting a daybyday account of the activities. DIARY OF A NUDIST is yet another boring film from the director but I'm actually going to give her more credit than normal because she actually makes this film look like a professional one which if you've ventured into this genre much you'll know that this isn't often the case with this type of movie. I'll also give Wishman credit for having a good eye for talent as the majority of the nudist range from extremely hot to incredibly cute looking. This here is always a major plus but sometimes these films don't deliver that. Obviously the main goal of this film was to show off as much nudity as possible so fans just wanting to see that are going to be in for a real treat. While this here might have been shocking or interesting in 1961 when viewed today you can't help but look at it as being tame. You also can't help but feel incredibly bored because even naked cute girls get boring after a while. There's really no story to speak of and the entire expose of the colony was just used by the producer to make you feel as if you were seeing more than just the nudity. Fans of the genre will probably want to check this out but I'd say most people are going to have a hard time making through the entire thing.".

Probably knowing a thing or two about law they jumped through as many loopholes as they could to use Drew Barrymore's image. Another issue I had with it was the fact that this film not only uses Barrymore but makes her an object to be desired. Is Barrymore a thing to be coveted? Does it not matter to this schlub that she actually has a boyfriend? If anyone needed a gimmick it was them. And they used it. But judgig that after the fests it only lasted a weekend in already limited release the gimmick does not work on audiences.".

He fawns over himself. He gazes lovingly at his own reflection. It's really a bit scary.3. There is no entertainment value. Just padding a few interviews with sad excelebs he's conned out of PRS and a lot of talking about how he's a great guy who should go for it. FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF! 4. It's really badly made.

The moronic Herlinger who clearly has never watched any film shot for less than 50 million grins like a lunatic over and over into the camera. When his mother tells the unemployed 27 year old that she reads The Star tabloid because everything in the rag is true I realized that Herlinger probably never had a chance. Still it's hard not to want to take a baseball bat to someone this utterly inane in that oh so L.A. way. As Joe Pesci would say I think someone needs a beatin'! Oh and I did check out some of the other responses. Clearly Herzlinger and his pals have been stuffing the ballot box as NO ONE would find this to be a great inspiring film.".

I can't tell you if he gets the date or not but I can guarantee you the journey is well worth your 90 minutes.

Some scenes are inappropriate and make the movie less about the date with Drew and more about Brian Herzlinger's personal life but this is forgivable because the rest of the film the Drewcentered parts that is are really fun. Without ruining anything some of the things he does to try to meet Drew Barrymore are pretty funny and pretty creative. Another beef would be that it is filmed in MiniDV but you could argue it's part of the appeal of the movie. The strongest aspect of the film in my opinion is the editing. Although the production value is extremely low 1100 from a game show the editing is amazing.After I saw it I came to IMDb to find out more about the filmmakers the editor particularly whom I thought was really good. What I found was amazing... People were fighting over the message boards. Now that's just sad. I never usually post I just visit for info but I felt that this movie needed a fair review from someone who's actually seen it. Some bits are too long some bits aren't as funny but overall it is an enjoyable experience.".

He gives himself a thirty day deadline to film his documentary after which he must return the camera he is using to Circuit City. Interestingly enough Circuit City has recently changed its thirty day return policy to fourteen days with a 20 restocking fee. I'm told this measure was taken as a direct result of the film. Anyway I can't tell you much else about the movie. There's no way to explain exactly what it makes you feel. It's definitely an emotionally powerful film. There were moments that made me laugh but more importantly this movie made me smile. In it I saw one of the purest examples of the beauty of hope. It's impossible to describe this feeling.

He uses a deft touch to examine the lives of a couple devastated by loss. The perfection of this film lies in the small touches the subtle gestures the powerful symbolism that Field displays throughout. Even the most powerfulmoment the shooting is done off camera. It isn't so much what you see its what you don't what Field implies throughout the film. He creates moments in this movie that convey complex emotion through subtle actions. The film createsunsettling scenes without being disturbing. Reflections of actors moving as if underwater through their lives we see them caught in the windows of theirhome ghosts in their house and in their lives struggling to cope until the film's resolution. Attempting to heal each other and themselves through a single act of redemption that seems at the same time surprising and inevitable. It isn't my favorite movie but i still think it's as close to a perfect film i've seen.".

	schema:reviewBody "In The Bedroom' is a beautiful film brilliantly paced slow but steady climaxing with Sissy Spacek's smashing of a plate on the kitchen floor then rolling heavily into the intensity of the inevitable but shocking conclusion.Spacek's character describes the torture of the emotional rollercoaster she feels after the murder of her son It comes in waves and then nothing... like a rest in music  no sound but so loud.  Thusly she describes director Todd Field's unique storytelling style.  Much of his film seems to take place in that musical rest.The first and last acts are vaguely sprinkled with a hauntingly beautiful score by Thomas Newman.  But the center and longest act is void of score leaving us to grapple with the noncinematic chillingly real emotions that these characters seem to be sharing directly with or hiding distinctly from the viewer.Cinematically speaking the story is like an extremely wellcrafted painting where the smallest seemingly insignificant details are made noticeable in a device used by Field to allow us to peer deeper into the emotions set within the scene or shot  not merely at the shot itself.Unanswered questions and vague silences which would never work in a more contrived picture speak volumes here adding shape and depth to the overall story.  And while some might see this film as morality play boosting corporal punishment and an eye for an eye mentality ultimately it plays more as a story that tugs at the heartstrings and plays on one's fears purely for the sake of entertainment.  As much as one could look for moral opinions in Shakespeare's Hamlet we moreover come away with an epic story told through masterful techniques  just as easily as with In The Bedroom'.In The Bedroom is not a Hollywood actionflick.  This is not a summersizzlefest or anything fitting of such tacky terminology.  This is a perfect example of modern FilmasArt a classically crafted story told by modestly stylized means and it's good to see such quality work emerging in this era so saturated with cinematic clich.Although quite unique the film did bring to mind several other films that seem to compliment its style and mood Todd Haynes' Far From Heaven Udayan Prasad's My Son The Fanatic and Robert Redford's Ordinary People.  All are films that explore the dynamics of extreme challenge and change in the lives of thoroughly defined characters.  In The Bedroom' however seems to stand out in this company as the example of a masterpiece.GRADE A".

We are accustomed to being flattered as an audience sent home feeling good that our side wins in the end against the evil.

	schema:reviewBody "9 out of 10Watching Todd Field's feature film debut In the Bedroom' I could not help but be impressed by the sheer audacity of the film by the spoton performances and by the many twists and turns that no critic should reveal. Yet amidst all the film's obvious strengths there was still something missingsomething to tie it all together something to endow the film with more than just a fleeting impression.Ironically perhaps I was provided this missing bit of information not by the film but by a male audience member sitting at the end of my aisle trying to explain the point of the film in less than derogatory terms to his female companion.You're missing the whole point of the film' he said.  It was all about men being controlled by women.'No doubt he read this interpretation from someone else's review of the film and what a sweet piece of justice it would be if that critic were a woman. It is quite possible that he was not even aware of the ramifications of what he had said.  But this man's legitimacy aside his statement has not left me since and the film in turn has had the same luck in escaping me.We are first introduced to Frank Fowler Nick Stahl Bully' and Natalie Strout Marisa Tomei My Cousin Vinny' he a young college student with no immediate plans to settle down she an older divorcee raising two children. They are in love though for Frank she is little more than a summer fling.' Meanwhile Natalie's exhusband Richard William Mapother Mission Impossible 2' is unwilling to let her out of his life and begins to be physically abusive to Frank. Frank's parents Matt Tom Wilkinson The Full Monty' and Ruth Sissy Spacek The Straight Story'both in top form hereshow appropriate concern for their only son and they intervene in this dangerous love triangle with unexpected twists and tragic results.The film jumps about in tone from a light romantic romp to a seeming political treatise to a creepy nocturnal thriller.  Some have criticized the film for this alleged inconsistency in tone slow pacing and a deliberate ending.  But these naysayers have overlooked the point.Frank may not even really love Natalie so much as he loves being controlled by her and sating his mother by being with her.  Richard becomes a threat to everyone because he is unwilling to let Natalie consider him out of her life he is a slave to her whim.  The resulting tension reveals a rift between Frank's parents and in particular his father's actions in the end demonstrate a helpless allegiance to his wife and her command.Field who up until now has been primarily an actor he was the piano player in Eyes Wide Shut' understands these important points but does not beat the viewer over the head with them.  He presents a reality more raw and true than any other piece of film in recent memory.  Yet he does so with a restraint that Hollywood seems to have forgotten.  Most of the film's violence is overheard or implied and only explicitly shown when necessary for the audience to completely understand what has happened.  This allows for more subtle details like a bridgekeeper who must run around in circles to alternate traffic between the road and the sea to emerge as truly haunting lasting images.But In the Bedroom' is not about any of these things.  It is first and foremost about its characters.  It does not fall prey to plot mechanics nor does it flinch at exploring even the most sympathetic characters' darkest sides.  For this and so many other reasons which are best left discussed behind closed doors between loved ones In the Bedroom' succeeds at turning the camera on flawed relationships of all forms and it is one of the best films of the year.".

The characters and story line is compelling the shots kept simple yet beautiful and the feel of the film is as real as most you will see. In the Bedroom would fit in perfectly with the some of the films from golden age of the 70s filmmaking. Unfortunately we are seeing this less and less of those types of films these days.It is hard to find a false moment whether in dialogue or behavior in this film. It deals with circumstances that we hear about every day yet is no less captivating because of it. We are not clobbered over the head with the moments we are meant to feel deeply yet they are apparent and often devastating to watch. There is an old saying you know the truth when you see it and that certainly applies to this film. There was a knot in my stomach the entire first 30 minutes of the film as director Field slowly builds to something you know is inevitable and almost can't bare to watch.Excellent performances turned in by Spacek Wilkinson Tomei as well as all the supporting players. Proof once again that actors often make some of the finest directors.".

The wouldbe cultural critics who point their pens and cameras on the American bourgeois insist this glossy sheen covers a subdura of rot and horror. Think of the opening scene in Blue Velvet  the camera leers at a pristine lawnscape before sinking into a layer of munching insects.

Todd Field has beaten them all by doing the opposite by pulling us so close to the drama we're blinded with ambivalence. Few films have been more disturbing more quietly devastating.Field's debut In the Bedroom based on an Andre Dubus short story applies a scalpel to the internal and external horrors of a Maine seaside hamlet. Dr. Matt Fowler Tom Wilkinson and his wife Ruth Sissy Spacek live quiet relatively happy lives respected in the community as people a bit better than their present stations. Matt is a family practitioner a man of gentile affability who yearns for everyone to like him something a family doctor yields easily he's generous and nave to a fault. Ruth is a bit more complicated  a former academic and professor she's been reduced to pawning her knowledge of Eastern European folk music onto a high school choir something she probably resents. Theirs is a wellmeaning but facile relationship  they've long since stopped telling the truth in favor of being nice to one another. And both are somewhat guilty of projecting casual disappointments onto their son Frank Nick Stahl.Frank is a general success story  a bright young kid possessing the selfeffacing affability and good looks impossible not to like. His parents and indeed the rest of the community adore him. What Frank lacks in brute masculinity he makes up for in sexual prowess he's run through a string of girlfriends but the latest his parents find troubling. Natalie Marisa Tomei is a much older freshly separated but not divorced mother of two young sons. Frank is allured by Natalie's beauty and unassuming nature Natalie is allured by well everything Frank is. It's easy to see how the relationship would be mutually flattering but Natalie is probably Frank's way of rejecting his parents. Ruth thinks the relationship is socially detrimental and will ultimately distract Frank from the architecture school he's poised to leave for at summer's end. Matt is concerned as well but too proud of his son for romancing a woman he and his friends see fit to ogle. Matt beams with pride even when his son damns him for marching eagerly in his own father's footsteps.To complicate matters Natalie's notquiteexhusband Richard William Mapother lurks in the fringes. If Frank is impossible not to love Richard is impossible not to hate. He's the worst kind of man whose brute anger and stupidity are matched by a slight physical ugliness drunk with an entitlement so internalized he can't fathom when others don't give him what he wants. Natalie has left him but he barges into her home regularly and harangues her for not wanting him let alone canoodling with a younger man. Richard represents the brute atavism found in lowerclass caricatures he even says at one point No I don't change everything around me changes. Field hints that class miscegenation is at the heart of this conflict but only just. Richard's family wields some power and money but from a decidedly lower social echelon. In any case it will only end in Frank's blood. And when that end comes it's more harrowing than any horror film. Field blankets the entire film with dread with suggestions of violence both emotional and physical. The middle section of the film wherein Matt and Ruth confront a grief they're incapable of dealing with who would be? is as troubling as the actual death. The two can't talk to one another to console or to blame as each holds the other responsible for Frank's death did Ruth push too hard or Matt not enough? Their marriage suppurates under guilt and resentment and Field doesn't sully the atmosphere with actual words but lets the emotions play in an understatement that mirrors Bergman or Ozu. Ruth wants to reach out to someone to express the inexpressible. Matt like so many men can't describe what he feels even when he wants to mostly he tries to pretend nothing has happened. I've never seen a portrait of grief to match In the Bedroom's quiet desperation.When the words finally arrive they're screamed and hissed the tension erupting from its horrible concealment. And maybe the two can forgive one another but the sheer injustice of their loss gnaws at them all the worse when it seems Richard will get off on a lenient manslaughter charge. Matt is galvanized with the masculine drive to fix things somehow to mend his marriage and avenge their wrong at the same time. And with regards to the middleclass expressing the inexpressible his options narrow to a grim inevitability.Richard's death so implicitly yearnedfor by character and audience is nothing to celebrate it's as horrible and damning as Frank's. Revenge might restore the balance Matt and Ruth yearn for but the damage it will surely wreak on their humanity is truly disturbing. Field has crafted a vision of bourgeois America of devastating darkness  that lowerclass crimes of passion will be met with a savagery borne of cruel calculation which one is really worse? In the Bedroom is a film of horrifying human truths executed with patience and skill and all of it should break your fcking heart. It is one of the most magnificent films of the decade.".

Sissy Spacek is also wonderful and the inevitable emotional fallout in their relationship after their shared experience is beautifully done. Very human  and very real. Though difficult to watch it is a great film great story with great performances all around by gifted actors. Not to be unsung are the excellent performances by Marisa Tomei and all the other supporting actors. A film that would benefit one to watch more than once there is that much substance there. Worth paying particular notice to is the opening metaphor in the scene on the lobster boat where Tom Wilkinson Dr. Fowler explains the nature of how a lobstertrap works  and the name the lobstermen and tradition have given to the inner part of the trap.

	schema:headline " A dark drama that will have you glued to the screen";
	schema:reviewBody "Sometimes it's fun to go see a movie without having any expectations or even having knowledge of the basic plot or premise. It's also nice to see a movie that would usually get ignored in a crowded market get a large amount of attention without having the plot be too obvious from trailers or commercials. Although In the Bedroom has been in theatres for a number of months it's only recently started getting attention and positive word of mouth after Sissy Spacek's Golden Globe nomination.Tom Wilkinson plays Dr. Matt Fowler and Sissy Spacek plays his music teacher wife an older couple living in a small Maine fishing town who become worried when their only son becomes involved with an older woman with two kids played by Marisa Tomei. Their worries soon prove to be warranted as the woman and her estranged husband proceed to destroy the teenager's life. Ultimately it has a devastating effect on the couple's everyday life and their relationship.This movie is a fascinating and powerful character study of people in a small town and how conflict and tragedy affect them. It is a story that takes place in three clearcut acts separated by two twists both of which take the viewer by surprise although they're both foreshadowed and somewhat expected.It's hard not to compare this movie to the recently released Monster's Ball one of my least favorite movies of last year but it's a fair comparison since it also showed a series of tragic and sudden events and how they affect the people in a small town. Unlike Monster's Ball I found the actions and emotions of the characters in this movie to be a lot more plausible and you can't help feeling the despair of the couple as they deal with their son's problems.In the Bedroom also compares to last year's The Deep End and Sam Raimi's underrated A Simple Plan two other slow movies that dealt with how small town folk deal with problems and how those problems sometimes lead to more drastic actions. It's never clear whether the Fowlers disapprove of their son's relationship is because the woman is older and has two kids or because of the problems that her estranged husband brings to the relationship. At times it seems like the Fowlers' only worry is that their son may not go to college in order to stick around and take care of his older lover and her kids.Either way the parents starts to drift apart due to their overpowering sense of grief and inability to change things and it's not long before they're playing the blame game on who is responsible for their son's situation. When they finally explode it's one of the most powerful film moments in recent memory. The shorter third act shows how they learn to cope and deal with their problems.Despite the slow pace and the excessive length the performances and the beautiful yet subdued camerawork and choice of setting keeps the viewer riveted to the screen.It's been far too long since we've seen Sissy Spacek in a movie and like this year's other comeback kid Robert Redford her age is showing. But her age also makes her perfect for the role of Ruth Lawler as her world weary eyes seem suitably representative of Ruth's own frustrations.Like last year's The Deep End and The Others this movie shows how an overprotective mother can alienate her children while trying to help them. Spacek gives another groundbreaking performance that shows talented yet less experienced actresses Tilda Swinton. Nicole Kidman and especially Halle Berry how to create realistic emotions on screen. Late in the movie there is a particularly tense yet short confrontation between Spacek and Marisa Tomei that shows how much better these two actresses are.Tom Wilkinson has played comedic parts in The Full Monty and has appeared in a number of period pieces including Sense and Sensibility and The Patriot. In the Bedroom proves him to be quite a talented dramatic lead actor as his performance allows him the full range of emotions and he creates a character as believable and real as Spacek's.Firsttime director Todd Field is probably best known as playing Nick Nightingale the pianist who gets Tom Cruise in a bit of trouble in Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut. Field uses the Maine setting beautifully to create a portrait of the couple's life and he uses the pacing to create insurmountable tension before driving a wedge between the couple. The script by Field and Robert Festinger is one of the better ones of the year with dialogue that is far too real yet perfectly suited for talents such as Spacek and Wilkinson.Obviously this movie will be getting a good deal of Oscar attention due to the performances by Spacek Wilkinson Tomei and the terrific script. If you want to see action go see Blackhawk Down if you want to see the fine form of filmmaking as perfected by two master thespians and a talented new director than In the Bedroom will have you riveted to the screen. Rating 9 out of 10".

I generally like every movie I see  some more than others  but this was just so dreadfully boring. Every review I heard or read talked about how controlling the Sissy Spacek character is and how she is trying to keep her son away from his girlfriend. I don't know what they saw but if you are hosting a bday party in your backyard for your son's girlfriend's son and attending soccer games I do not think you are trying to keep him away from her too much.  Yes she made comments here and there and subtly tried to get him away from her but I in no way saw her as controlling.  The guy did what he wanted.Once the poor guy died the movie died right along with him.  Marissa Tomei needed to be in it more.  What did Sissy Spacek do that was so groundbreaking?  I say bravo to her smoking sleeping and sitting on the couch  watching tv skills.  She also played the silenttype quite well. She finally yelled once and broke a bowl.  I did not find anything she did awardwinning.  I think I could have played her role  practically anyone could have!  If anyone deserved a nomination not a win it was Tom Wilkinson.And lastly the big shock of the movie.  Who didn't see the 2nd murder coming a mile away?  I kept thinking this can't be the big shock of the movie there has to be something more.  I was expecting the Sissy Spacek character to have committed suicide when her husband returned home from doing his deed.  Then when she went downstairs I thought maybe he would have committed suicide.  This was called In The Bedroom wasn't it???? Shouldn't something shocking happen there?  How often were they ever in the bedroom?  Hardly at all and when they were nothing happened.  Sissy puffed on her cigarette as she sewed and they boringly briefly talked.This was by far one of the worst movies I've seen and I can't believe all the hoopla over it.  What a joke!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Todd Field's IN THE BEDROOM is an artistic and realistic portrait of domestic trouble in smalltown America. Sissy Spacek and Tom Wilkinson star as Ruth and Matt Fowler the parents of a recent high school graduate Frank Nick Stahl who has an affair with a married woman Natalie Marisa Tomei. A tragic event near the beginning of the film seems to stunt its action and dialogue allowing the film to change into a largely visual piece based on memories feelings and silent communication while the film's slowmoving camera soft sunny lighting and cautious pacing give it a resonating intensity. Set in coastal Maine the Fowlers are a wellliked family with simple straightforward values. Dr. Fowler has his own small medical practice. Mrs. Fowler directs the chorus at the high school. Frank is a good kid who is working on the fishing docks for the summer waiting for college in the fall. Frank falls into a summer romance with Natalie an older woman with two young sons and a creepy lurking husband William Mapother from whom she is separated. The relationship is worrisome to Mr. and Mrs. Fowler but they want to be supportive of their son so they gently nudge him to think about the bigger picture without being overbearing. But when the unthinkable happens Mr. and Mrs. Fowler come face to face with their worst nightmare. Quietly calmly and with the most logic they can muster they begin a dark and dangerous psychological journey. The result reinforced by stunning performances from Wilkinson and Spacek is a pensive penetrating and utterly believable story.".

	schema:reviewBody "When a film with such emotional resonance and visual poise as In the Bedroom makes it to the screen it seems an unexpected gift meant to remind us of the medium's possibility for sensitivity and epiphany. Director Todd Field who adapted the film from a story by Andre Dubus quietly observes the loss rage and inexorable desire for revenge that follows the murder of a 21yearold son. The film opens with Frank Nick Stahl back from college for the summer taking up with Natalie Marisa Tomei a slightly older sexually alluring woman with two boys and an estranged husband prone to violence. It is the tender portrayal of love between Frank and his parents even as Frank and Natalie's relationship reveals the prejudices of all involved that makes the subsequent anguish of the film so acute. Matt and Ruth Fowler Tom Wilkinson and Sissy Spacek middleclass denizens of a Maine lobster town where everyone knows each other toil through weeks of devastation and blame following Frank's murder before their outrage obliterates all else. Field's exact handling of jealousy class division and grief is abetted by careerhighlight performances from Wilkinson and Spacek. In the Bedroom is one of the Best American dramas to grace the new millennium so far".

After a certain number of shots of sad faces I was not sorry for them anymore and became upset that the plot wasn't going anywhere. Then it did spinning in a direction and ending in a climax that seemed totally unmotivated and unreal. Note When Matt Fowler comes into the bedroom the final time I totally predicted Ruth's line to the word... because I had been thinking I would be so mad if she said this... and then she did. Crazy. There were maybe three really exciting scenes one in which the wonderful but underutilized Marisa Tomei whose accent may or may not have been a bit unsettled... are you British or southern? got to act really hard. The rest of the movie was virtually silent with a lot of shots of wheatcolored New England. Besides being dull to look at and hear it was dull to watch. With the exception of Wilkinson whose acting was amazing but character suffered the cast for which I had had such high hopes  hello! Sissy Spacek! was weak. I'm glad I saw it but I didn't like it.

The one thing that was truely exceptional were the realistic potrayals of Marisa Tomei Sissy Spacek  Tom Wilkinson.

Showing more of her grief  sadness which she did so well would've helped add more drama to the movie. Spacek  Wilkinson as grieving parents like Tomei are very believable  very exceptional in some scenes.  Watching Spacek in her rage makes the viewer almost angry w her as she is tormented from her loss. Tom Wilkinson in the scene where he is subtlely crying in his son's bedroom is so beyond realistic it is frightening.  Both actors make you feel as if you are actually watching a true life story about a young life so tragically taken.  The only scene that was particularily disappointing was when the parents are fighting about who is to blame for what happend. Although the acting is not unsufficient it is much too weak  not nearly as riveting as some of the previous scenes. As the movie winds down to the conclusion it starts to drag.  The very last scene is somewhat confusing although understanding to a certain effect.

I recently watched the ending and appreciated the craft of the entire crew especially the director in the choices he made. For me the movie is not about the crimes committed or who are your friends when times are bad rather it's about that little monster that we have inside of us that when given the chance will choose for us to be and do unthinkable things.There are a lot movies that I've seen that never warrant a second look much less a third or fourth. That's because the director has played all of hisher cards right up front. Once you seen the movie once there is nothing else to see. With In the Bedroom I noticed the quiet there was no constant music theme interrupting my thoughts. I noticed the performances of Wilkinson Spacek and Marisa Tomei.. The Tomei role intrigued me. I remembered her best as Lisa Bonet cocky room mate in the first season of TV sitcom A Different World. I noticed the crabs and the town how there seemed be no diversity.My second look had me pay closer attention to monster played with perfection by Sissy Spacek. Even in her mid fifties Sissy Spacek is cute and we all had cute monsters in our life. Monsters are things that a far more relentless then we are. Monsters get what they want with out ever compromising. They are unreasonable like Javier Bardem in No Country for Old Men or Daniel DayLewis in There Will Be Blood. Movies where the monster wins leaves the audience dissatisfied but will to go back and take another look. My most recent look got me paying attention to the scenery how beautiful old towns bay views dense forest and sea ports are. That no matter how beautiful nature is it is relentless and will get its way.".

That's because the director has played all of hisher cards right up front. Once you seen the movie once there is nothing else to see. With In the Bedroom I noticed the quiet there was no constant music theme interrupting my thoughts. I noticed the performances of Wilkinson Spacek and Marisa Tomei.. The Tomei role intrigued me. I remembered her best as Lisa Bonet cocky room mate in the first season of TV sitcom A Different World. I noticed the crabs and the town how there seemed be no diversity.My second look had me pay closer attention to monster played with perfection by Sissy Spacek. Even in her mid fifties Sissy Spacek is cute and we all had cute monsters in our life. Monsters are things that a far more relentless then we are. Monsters get what they want with out ever compromising. They are unreasonable like Javier Bardem in No Country for Old Men or Daniel DayLewis in There Will Be Blood. Movies where the monster wins leaves the audience dissatisfied but will to go back and take another look. My most recent look got me paying attention to the scenery how beautiful old towns bay views dense forest and sea ports are. That no matter how beautiful nature is it is relentless and will get its way.";

	schema:headline " Quality drama goes in unexpected directions";
	schema:reviewBody "The opening scene of two young lovers frolicking in a field sets an idyllic tone that evolves to tragic death by the end of the first act. Unexpected changes of course typify the story.In the first act we meet the players. The lovers are Frank Fowler and Natalie Strout. Natalie is separated from her abusive husband and has two young boys Frank is the son of Matt and Ruth Fowler. The Fowlers live in a small Maine town where Matt is a medical doctor and Ruth is a Brown graduate with an interest in Eastern European folk songs. The basic tension between the two cultures of Natalie and Richard versus the Fowlers is developed quickly but with depth  we feel that we know these people and what they are thinking about each other. The class conflicts are not of wealth but of lifestyle. Natalie's husband Richard is the son of a welltodo lobster fishing magnate but he is a crude bully. Between raising her kids and dealing with Richard Natalie has had a difficult life. On the other hand Dr. Fowler plays in poker games where it is not unusual for someone to spontaneously quote from poems of Blake and Longfellow. Ruth reads books on the Wyeths in fact the opening scene is so reminiscent of Andrew Wyeth's painting Christina's World that some of director Field's imagery must have been inspired by Wyeth. Frank is going to an upper class school with a talent and passion for architecture. In one telling scene he is expressing his appreciation for a particular home design to Natalie and her reaction clearly indicates that she has not often been around people with intellectual passions. The second act deals with the effects of Frank's death and you get about as detailed a look at the consequences of tragedy on a marriage as you are likely to see. The movie title is apt it's as if we were allowed into a bedroom where intimate matters are discussed that no one will ever know but those in that room. We come to know the secrets of Matt and Ruth in such a personal way that we are almost embarrassed by our being such willing voyeurs. Never has grief been so acutely portrayed and it will be the unusual person who is not gripped by it. Grief gives way to anger  anger at the cause of the death and anger at a justice system that moves at a snail's pace and places a heavy onus on the plaintiff to prove something in a court of law.The third act concerns an act of vigilantism on the part of Dr. Fowler. This seems out of character on his part until the brief final scene makes you realize that he is more motivated by marital considerations than by revenge. This movie is about a marriage not about revenge.The acting is thoroughly convincing. The three main actors  Tom Wilkinson Sissy Spacek and Marisa Tomei  received welldeserved Oscar nominations. The entire cast is first rate. From the moment that Richard William Mapother comes on the scene he projects a foreboding presence.The screenplay is tight and insightful. For example when Ruth is describing her feelings of grief to her minister she says It comes in waves and then nothing. Like a rest in music. No sound but so loud. This comment could be applied to the movie itself. Particularly effectively portrayed is how in the throes of a personal crisis daytoday life seems so insignificant and meaningless.A final thought I had about this movie is how we have come to expect and accept quality cinematography. There is nothing special about the filming here it's just extremely well done  the climatic scene between Ruth and Matt as they move from room to room is particularly impressive. This is an example of your not tending to notice things when they are done well but only when not.This story is simple in its telling but complex in its themes. It engaged me from beginning to end.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the Bedroom was one of those films that I heard about but never saw because of the misleading title.  I watched it for the first time last night and am glad I did.  A fantastic cast wonderful performances and solid direction.Wilkinson and Spacek play a normal New England couple whose world is almost destroyed when their collegeage son is murdered by the exhusband of his older girlfriend Tomei.  When it appears that our legal system is unable to do the right thing Wilkinson and his best friend take things into their own hand and eventually do what justice cannot.I was totally sucked into this film and cannot even remember if it had a musical score.  While it dragged a little in the middle maybe this was necessary to set up the audience for the inevitable and violent ending. Director Todd Field accomplished more in one steady shot than most directors do in whole scenes like when he centered the camera on the license plate of Wilkinson's Saab as he observed his son's killer at his place of work. The bottom of the plate had one word Veteran This told the audience several things  that Wilkinson probably knew how to handle weapons that he may have been in combat or at a minimum that he was trained how to kill by the military.  This same fact was also established for Wilkinson's partner in crime as the camera panned across numerous photos of him obviously taken during the Vietnam War.I also liked the part when Wilkinson abducted the killer and forced him to turn on a baseball game on the radio as opposed to having to converse with the man he knows murdered his only son.  Not only did it eliminate the need for conversation in the car as he guided the killer to his own death but it showed that Wilkinson did not want to relate to the murderer that he wanted the man to remain an objectas opposed to a human being  this probably making it easier to kill him in the end.While it's a matter of opinion as to whether or not Wilkinson was justified in murdering his son's killer the film expertly shows the trauma experienced by the family of murder victims and how normal law abiding citizens can be forced to take matters into their own hands and do what needs to be done even if it involves breaking the law.".

The main problem lies in the fact that this is supposed to be a realistic look at tragic events in a small town and the emotional devastation two parents feel over the murder of their son.  Yes most of the acting was naturalistic and nuanced but I didn't buy for a single moment any of the main turn of events.  I blame this on a hackneyed script and over confident director Todd Field seemed to be screaming Oh look at me I can do long meditative shots of pretty drapes blowing in a breeze oh aren't I artistic?.SPOILER ALERT I did not believe that Marisa Tomei's character would seriously date a college age boy.  I also did not believe that her exhusband would actually kill him beat him up and harass him yes but shoot him...I just did not see that in the character.  Finally I did not believe that Tom Wilkinson's character would seek out revenge in the fashion that he did.  The scenes that were supposed to be chilling and revelatory were for me just plain predictable and unrealistic.As for the acclaimed acting it was good given the madeforTVmovie plot they were stuck in.  I think Marisa Tomei was better however playing a similar character in Unhook the Stars.  Tom Wilkinson was solid but he still didn't make me believe that he was capable of doing what he did in the end.  As for Sissy Spacek for me she was simply method acting and was far better doing it in a supporting role like the one she had in David Lynch's The Straight Story.It's amazing that two godawful films were nominated for best picture for 2001.  While this film is horrible at least it isn't in the running for worst picture of all time on my list like the stupifying Moulin Rouge.".

	schema:headline " The Most Overlooked Parody of Last Year...Pure Fun from Start to Finish!";
	schema:reviewBody "Eight Legged Freaks was originally titled Arac Attack before the film's star David Arquette thought of a better title Eight Legged Freaks. The great thing about this title is it sets up the film perfectlyit's a parody and a surprisingly entertaining and hilarious and fun one too.David Arquette is the film's main character the local boy who has returned after 10 years and still has a crush on cute Sheriff Sam Parker Kari Wuhrer. Once he arrives he tries to spark a relationship with her but everything is put on hold when mutated spiders which formed from pollution in the mining caves start to attack humans and animals and everything goes haywire. Now David's character must put an end to these eight legged freaks before all legs break loose. Yeah that was a pretty bad pun.Eight Legged Freaks was one of the biggest surprises of last year mainly because it was so darn funny and such a good spoof. I went into the theater expecting at the bare minimum a film with a rating of...say...2 2.55 stars. I'd have to give this a 3.5. It was completely overlooked probably the most overlooked film of last year though that is pushing it. The parody is classic.Do you remember those old films about mining towns in the middle of nowhere population 9 where giant grasshoppers spiders wormsheck I saw a film with giant ants oncestart attacking? That's what Eight Legged Freaks spoofs. It takes the old formulas and twists it around to have fun with.Towards the end I found myself having such a pleasurable experience that I couldn't believe this film was so underrated. Nothing is more fun than seeing a bunch of people going after giant spiders with shotgunsit's pure fun. The people that went into this film expecting Oscar material were nuts.The most sad thing about Eight Legged Freaks is that the people going into Men in Black II were probably expecting something like this something funny smart original witty and satirical. I went into Men in Black II expecting something as good as Eight Legged Freaks and apparently Roger Ebert did too. I'm on the same level with him because I thought this film was extremely entertaining. There are some plot holes and stupid cliches but most of them are there to be made fun of. People going into deserted malls late at night trying to escape the spiders people going into the lair of the spiders which ends in them being chased by a giant Black Widow Spider. Y'know those movies where people do things and you hear people in the movie theater maybe it's you shouting Don't go in there! It'll get you!? That's what Eight Legged Freaks plays on. Basically this film makes fun of every misused Bmonster movie cliche and that's what is so darn funny about this movie.This film delivered everything I go to the movies for.3.55 stars John Ulmer".

	onyx:emotionText "Eight Legged Freaks was originally titled Arac Attack before the film's star David Arquette thought of a better title Eight Legged Freaks. The great thing about this title is it sets up the film perfectlyit's a parody and a surprisingly entertaining and hilarious and fun one too.David Arquette is the film's main character the local boy who has returned after 10 years and still has a crush on cute Sheriff Sam Parker Kari Wuhrer. Once he arrives he tries to spark a relationship with her but everything is put on hold when mutated spiders which formed from pollution in the mining caves start to attack humans and animals and everything goes haywire. Now David's character must put an end to these eight legged freaks before all legs break loose. Yeah that was a pretty bad pun.Eight Legged Freaks was one of the biggest surprises of last year mainly because it was so darn funny and such a good spoof. I went into the theater expecting at the bare minimum a film with a rating of...say...2 2.55 stars. I'd have to give this a 3.5. It was completely overlooked probably the most overlooked film of last year though that is pushing it. The parody is classic.Do you remember those old films about mining towns in the middle of nowhere population 9 where giant grasshoppers spiders wormsheck I saw a film with giant ants oncestart attacking? That's what Eight Legged Freaks spoofs. It takes the old formulas and twists it around to have fun with.Towards the end I found myself having such a pleasurable experience that I couldn't believe this film was so underrated.

They mutate and become gigantic monsters that go on a feeding frenzy through town and it's up to a few courageous townspeople to improvise a plan and take them out. I believe their first victim was the scientist himself so a nerdy kid obsessed with arachnids has to take charge in the plans to destroy the monsters before they get to the city. A great film for DVD rental night i'd never spend money to buy a copy and I think the kids would really like it.

This and Arachnophobia are my two favorite spider films.This is a horrorcomedy a genre that's difficult to pull off effectively. What makes it work are the personalities sic! of the spiders. They're not unlike the title characters in Gremlins another favorite as they gleefully go about rampaging and wreaking havoc among the humans it's worth noting that the film never actually shows anyone meeting their gruesome death nor do any of the humans you come to know actually die. And that's the key  although these spiders are physically typical of their kind their actions have been anthropomorphized to make them much less creepy. Just as in Gremlins they've been given voices  which real giant spiders undoubtedly wouldn't have. The human actors while uniformly competent are consistently upstaged by the CGI spiders. Also like Gremlins the small town setting is populated by a collection of eccentrics which only helps. The plot is just a device on which to hang the action and comedy. It's silly but no sillier than nay other giant creature film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Certainly there were any number of reasons for me to not like 'Eight Legged Freaks' before I watched it. I'm not a spider guy so I wasn't really interested in the first place. As far as actors go I can't stand David Arquette. Generally I find him aggravating in the extreme and his characters highly unlikeable  but more on that in a moment. And to paraphrase Val Lewton about his own RKO films It's hard for critics to give positive reviews to films called 'I Walked With a Zombie.'At the time of this review's writing the film has a rating on the IMDb of 5.510. I'm actually quite surprised by that because despite my own personal biases the film proved me wrong. I had no level of expectation for it and really no desire to watch it in the first place. I was wrong and I admit it. It was truly funny with some great sight gags and lines. There are definitely some decent scares and a pretty competent job of raising the level of tension in the film to a steady and consistent level. David Arquette surprised me and this might be the best performance he's ever put in. My personal bias against him was dead wrong in this movie.'Eight Legged Freaks' is a throw back to creature films of the 50's and as some other reviewers have alluded to more contemporary films like 'Gremlins' and 'Tremors.' Horrorcomedy is a difficult genre to work within but 'Eight Legged Freaks' manages to pull it off. The acting all around is good. A lot of the film is satirical Doug E Doug's conspiracy guy and the cgi is so obvious and over the top that while it might be aggravating in a movie that took itself more seriously you can't help but admire and respect the results.That really is the strength of the movie  it doesn't take itself as seriously as a lot of its critics did. 'Eight Legged Freaks' does what the best films should do for two hours you forget you're watching a movie and you just enjoy yourself. I hope that time will be kind and maybe people will come around and give the movie another chance. Had this film taken itself seriously we would have ended up with a spider version of 'Bats.' This version and its selfdeprecation are much worthier of your time.".

	schema:headline " Arachnid Goofballs";
	schema:reviewBody "This is going to date me. Eight Legged Freaks is the first time I can remember being excited about a movie no one else cared about. It was my first year of high school I think. I was just far enough into my teens that my love of black and white creature features were confirmed. Someone was attempting to revive the big bug picture in 2002? Hell yeah I was up for me. No one else was. It bombed domestically though broke even internationally and reviews were middling. The movie isn't quite old or endearing enough to have a cult following. If the Eight Legged Freaks fandom has to start somewhere let it start with me.The story is basically Gremlins by way of Tarantula. This is most obvious in how the film treats its threats. The giant spiders of Eight Legged Freaks are arachnid goof balls. The CGI is clearly dated but the animators and special effect guys made sure the spiders had personality. They mumble shriek and grumble like Killer Tomatoes. Their vocalizations are intentionally exaggerated and cartoonish. On two separate occasions giant spiders get dragged behind moving cars. One grumbles in frustration after taking a bite out of a stuffed moose. Another jumps flat into a closed window. One spider outboxes a boxer. Another cheers on his brothers as they rush the mall. One slides down on a rope screaming the whole way. A shot spider swings on a thread dousing his pals with green spider goop. One of the best spider gags involves a sneaky tent. Even a diehard arachnophobe is more likely to laugh then scream. Eight Legged Freaks is less a modern reinvention of the classic big bug flick then a Mel Brooks parody on the subgenre. I guess some might find that to be a onenote joke but I don't know guys wacky giant spiders? Count me in.The film also nails the small town setting. Prosperity Arizona is nicely isolated at times. The ensemble cast quickly gives you a sense of community. You believe that this small time is fighting for their mutual survival. The crusty old barber and nearsided janitor are equally amusing each assign simple entertaining personalities. Doug E. Doug finds a great home for his overtaxed comedic style as the local conspiracy radio host. His beleaguered shouts of frustration prove consistently funny. Rick Overton is also great as Deputy Pete. His reactions to the spiders are at first shocked confusion later transitioning to deadpan fear. Leon Rippy's talents are also wellsuited to the conniving town mayor. Tom Noonan uncredited and with minutes of screen time makes an impression too. The strong character actor cast is another reason to love Eight Legged Freaks. The supporting cast proves far more memorable then the leads. I'm willing to give David Arquette more slack then others. But there's no mistaking the guy for leading man material. His attempts at oneliners are especially groaninducing. His performance works best when playing up his nervous qualities. Kari Wuhrer is never convincing as a mom or action heroine. Yeah she looks fantastic in tight jeans and tshirts but can hardly carry the film. She has zero chemistry with Arquette. Even Scarlett Johansson hardly a great actress in her right outshines the leads. And also looks fantastic in tight tshirts and jeans. You can actually see elements of a more serious horror film under Eight Legged Freaks goofy exterior. A mouthful of spiders regardless of size is likely to make some squirm. The trapdoor spiders snatching people running across a parking lot could have been mined for real scares. Probably the biggest action setpiece in the film is the jumping spiders going after the kids on dirt bikes. This is the closest the film comes to real tension and even then it's awash in silly special effects. I'm not complaining simply noting. It wouldn't surprise me if this started life as a more serious screenplay.The script is decently constructed. You can tell that the cigarettes stun gun and underground gas veins will be important later. I still appreciate the effort to set them up. I also appreciate the horror injokes Them on TV the mall invasion finale the Hockey MaskChainsaw combo. The MickyMousing score is probably the only thing about the movie I don't like. That's the only overly jokey element. Even then incorporating a lowpitched version of Itsy Bitsy Spider was clever. An early scene where a spider and a cat wrestle inside a wall probably goes on too long and reaches too hard for the kind of silly laughs the rest of the movie has no problem with. Eight Legged Freaks is still underrated and underseen. This surprises me. I can think of many horror fans who would love its goofy charms.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is going to date me. Eight Legged Freaks is the first time I can remember being excited about a movie no one else cared about. It was my first year of high school I think. I was just far enough into my teens that my love of black and white creature features were confirmed. Someone was attempting to revive the big bug picture in 2002? Hell yeah I was up for me. No one else was. It bombed domestically though broke even internationally and reviews were middling. The movie isn't quite old or endearing enough to have a cult following. If the Eight Legged Freaks fandom has to start somewhere let it start with me.The story is basically Gremlins by way of Tarantula. This is most obvious in how the film treats its threats. The giant spiders of Eight Legged Freaks are arachnid goof balls. The CGI is clearly dated but the animators and special effect guys made sure the spiders had personality. They mumble shriek and grumble like Killer Tomatoes. Their vocalizations are intentionally exaggerated and cartoonish. On two separate occasions giant spiders get dragged behind moving cars. One grumbles in frustration after taking a bite out of a stuffed moose. Another jumps flat into a closed window. One spider outboxes a boxer. Another cheers on his brothers as they rush the mall. One slides down on a rope screaming the whole way. A shot spider swings on a thread dousing his pals with green spider goop. One of the best spider gags involves a sneaky tent. Even a diehard arachnophobe is more likely to laugh then scream. Eight Legged Freaks is less a modern reinvention of the classic big bug flick then a Mel Brooks parody on the subgenre. I guess some might find that to be a onenote joke but I don't know guys wacky giant spiders? Count me in.The film also nails the small town setting. Prosperity Arizona is nicely isolated at times. The ensemble cast quickly gives you a sense of community. You believe that this small time is fighting for their mutual survival. The crusty old barber and nearsided janitor are equally amusing each assign simple entertaining personalities. Doug E.

Fogshrouded 19th century London has rarely been presented this well in ANY picture.

Sir Seymour Hicks had been playing the part of Scrooge from the last century when he was in his twenties and criticized by some critics for being too young for the role. Hicks did a silent version of Scrooge in 1913 it was his screen debut. What we are seeing here is not Charles Dickens per se but an adaption of the play Hicks did by writer H. Fowler Mear. Still the spirit of Dickens message of universal brotherhood is not affected in any way by the screenplay.I have to say that I marveled at Hicks even without dialog being able to create through force of personality and maybe some makeup the soul of the miserly Ebenezer Scrooge and then after his encounter with the three spirits a reformed contrite and merry Scrooge. It's like watching two different people in the same role.Hopefully more of the public on this side of the big pond will get to see Sir Seymour Hicks essay the role of the greatest reformed miser in history. They will be blessed everyone.".

Still the spirit of Dickens message of universal brotherhood is not affected in any way by the screenplay.I have to say that I marveled at Hicks even without dialog being able to create through force of personality and maybe some makeup the soul of the miserly Ebenezer Scrooge and then after his encounter with the three spirits a reformed contrite and merry Scrooge. It's like watching two different people in the same role.Hopefully more of the public on this side of the big pond will get to see Sir Seymour Hicks essay the role of the greatest reformed miser in history. They will be blessed everyone.";

	schema:headline " Makes an interesting contrast with the Alastair Sim version";
	schema:reviewBody "To many or most people the 1951 version is so familiar that it is a bit of a shock to see a different but equally valid version. The Sim version is still the definitive one I feel but ...The Sim Scrooge is utterly plausible much of the time but then he will be as giddy as a schoolboy for example giving an interpretation that an incorrigible naysayer could choose to quibble about. My reaction to Seymour Hicks was similar but strangely in alternation with Sim  oh he's better than Sim here worse than Sim here more realistic here less realistic here. Any given scene with Hicks could be better worse or just plain different from the corresponding scene with Sim. This is partly what made seeing this version so enjoyable you really couldn't secondguess the next scene.There are significant differences in the portrayal of the ghosts. I think we are all familiar with Michael Hordern's eerie and frightening ghost of Jacob Marley shrouded in chains from 1951. In this version Marley's ghost is invisible!! You hear the chains but you see nothing whatsoever. The Ghosts of Christmas Past and Future are also quite noncorporeal. Only the Ghost of Christmas Present is someone we recognize from Sim.Tiny Tim is quite different. We expect Tiny Tim to be an eternal optimist irrepressibly cheerful. But the Sim Tim boy I loved typing that seems to overdo it a little. He appears to be on something to use the vernacular. In this version Tim is toned down. In some ways it's an improvement. In the Sim version to its credit there is a special balance however namely the repentant Scrooge has an exuberance which matches Tim's precisely and they appear together in the final shot as we all know. A perfect ending. Back to that later. A key difference in Hicks at the tragic moment we do not see the lonely crutch we're used to oh no we see Tiny Tim lying dead!!This version has some scenes which are not in Sim. This version in general has more singing and one of the extra scenes involves the Lord Mayor of London giving his Christmas toast to Victoria followed by the singing of God Save The Queen.In Sim Scrooge comes to his senses on Christmas Day and there is a warm and funny scene with Mrs. Dilber the housekeeper. Not here. Here there is an extended scene of Scrooge and the prize turkey! Scrooge goes to the butcher shop which is closed snow falls on Scrooge Scrooge throws snow snow hits butcher. Butcher opens up Scrooge orders turkey Scrooge goes home. Scrooge gets dressed boy brings butcher Scrooge still dressing butcher tries to leave with huge turkey Scrooge answers door. Scrooge then pays the butcher pays the boy and gives the boy extra money so the boy can take the turkey to Bob Cratchit's house in a cab! Scrooge then leaves the house whereupon he meets the two gentlemen who were soliciting for the poor earlier in the film and volunteers to give them 100 pounds!So how does the film end? There's nothing about rushing right out to buy a new coal scuttle. No mention of scuttles in this film. It's Boxing Day and Scrooge gives Bob the day off. Then Scrooge joins Cratchit in church ! for the singing of Hark the Herald Angels Sing. The End with Tiny Tim not to be seen anywhere. So perhaps it's the warm emphasis on Tim that really clinches the 1951 version.There are many moments of surprise and enjoyment here if the opportunity should ever present itself.".

	schema:reviewBody "Because of the overwhelming popularity of Alistair Sim's portrayal of Ebenezer Scrooge this trimmer older version may be overlooked as a matter of course. To some it may appear creaky and old fashioned and yet after watching Sir Seymour Hick's performance it is difficult to disagree with the claim that his is the best rendition of the miser so far given. What this particular telling of Dickens' classic tale has going for it is the time spent with the first part of the story which focuses on the cruel  despicable Ebenezer. Hicks with scant makeup cannot be outdone as the embodiment of a person who is to be avoided at all costs. The problem with the other films is that they spend too little time with the first 3rd of the story. One of the most important details has to be the transformation of Scrooge and if not enough time in proportion is given in the beginning the end result doesn't come off as strong. And as with most people who grew up watching say Basil Rathbone as Sherlock Holmes personified well then if you viewed Hicks before Sims you would no doubt cast your vote for Hicks who had in fact played the part before. In the acting department the other actors do a very fine job as well. As for special effects you'll be best forewarned not to expect any. The main question though regarding this motion picture is the exact running time. There are 2 editions that are shown on TV one 60 minutes the other a minute longer. The scene that is missing from one is when Mr. Scrooge follows after the boy to the butcher's to see the prize goose he is about to purchase. The other various minutes are as follows video catalogs have given it 61 The World Encyclopedia of the Film has 67 and IMDb 78!".

	schema:headline " An Interesting Early Version Of A Familiar Story";
	schema:reviewBody "There's absolutely no way around the fact that every version of A Chrismas Carol that you will ever watch is going to be viewed through the lens of the 1951 Alastair Sim classic even more than it will be looked at through the lens of the Dickens story itself. This very early version the earliest talkie version as far as I can see stands up pretty well in that respect. Seymour Hicks was a very convincing Ebenezer Scrooge with a different take on the character than Sim presented. Sim's Scrooge was  while mean and crotchety  a somewhat comic character whereas Hicks seems to emphasize Scrooge's essential nastiness making his ultimate transformation even more jarring in some ways. The story has all the basic elements and so there are no real surprises in that sense but there are some differences worth noting. Aside from the early shot of Marley's face in the door knocker I found it interesting that Marley's ghost was invisible to the viewer although seen apparently by Scrooge. Marley's spirit also came across as stronger than in the '51 version where he was a more pathetic creature although afflicted in the same way. I also found the visits of the three Christmas spirits somewhat truncated  especially the visit of the Spirit of Christmas Past who offered Scrooge only a couple of scenes revolving around his love Belle with no mention of Fezziwig and no mention of Fan. There was however some interesting additional material. The scene of the Lord Mayor's banquet seemed to put Scrooge's essential isolation into stronger focus. With no compassion for the poor Scrooge is also completely alienated from the wealthy and while the poor celebrate as best they can and the wealthy enjoy a huge banquet Scrooge dines alone and then goes home to a lonely house. The end of the movie also puts Scrooge's transformation in a different context. Whereas the end of the '51 version emphasizes the relationship Scrooge develops with Tiny Tim the end of this version has Scrooge joining Cratchet in church to sing Hark! The Herald Angels Sing. What I took from that was that in this version Scrooge's transformation was a spiritual transformation as well as a personal one. This is a very interesting version of the story. 710".

Aside from Hicks most of the other characters do not have that much of a presence and it does not have the kind of lavish detail that enriches for example the great Alastair Sim version.  But the atmosphere works and the story is faithfully told and moves fairly quickly. Every actor who portrays the famous miser has his own interpretation of the role and Hicks himself is above average lending appropriate nuances to his character's personality change while remaining believable.The story has been filmed so many times that it's hardly possible to avoid making comparisons among the various versions.

	schema:reviewBody "It's now been 72 years since this film's release in December of 1935 but I had never seen it until the other evening on late night PBS television. I really enjoy Christmasthemed films so I'm surprised that I had never seen it before. It does have a good old Dickensonian flavor to it but it's not nearly as good as the MGM A Christmas Carol film that came out three years later with Reginald Owen or the Scrooge from 1951 with Alistair Sim which was the best of filmed adaptations of the Charles Dickens story. Noted British stage actor Sir Seymour Hicks is Ebenezer Scrooge in this offering adapted by screenwriter H. Fowler Mear and directed by Henry Edwards. It of course is the tale of an old miserly businessman in 1840's London who makes life as tough as it is even more miserable for those around him out of the misery and emptiness he carries with him all his adult life. A late night Christmas Eve visit by the ghost of his longdead business partner will tell him that he will have additional ghostly apparitions that night and there still may be time to make atonement. Donald Calthrop is Scrooge's employee Bob Cratchit Mary Glynne is Scrooge's past love Belle and Robert Cochran is the nephew. Hicks made a stage career out playing Scrooge and appeared years before in a silent film adaptation so he's quite familiar with the role but it's not a particularly great performance in this film. The other principal roles are delivered forced or wooden and only some of the minor roles are acted convincingly. This was a 61 minute version of the original 78 minute film so in some fairness it was not the complete intended film but even with that said it is still not that very good. Julius Hagen who was known as the Tsar of Twickenham was the film's producer and head of the small Twickenham film studios in London. He was known for churning out quickie films that were shot on low budget with run times between 60 and 80 minutes. He put out 19 films alone in the year Scrooge came out in 1935. Two years later he was bankrupt and by 1940 was dead. Twickenham lived on though despite being almost bombed out of existence during World War II. The Beatles filmed most of A Hard Days Night scenes for Help and the rehearsals in Let it Be at Twickenham. An American Werewolf in London and A Fish Called Wanda along with many other notable movies have also been filmed there. I'd recommend checking out the 1935 Scrooge but it's nowhere near the 1951 or 1938 filmed versions. I would give this a 6.0 out of 10.".

I have read the unabridged novelette several times  Always during the Christmas Season  Over the past few years and it is my most favorite piece of literature ever written. It therefore follows that I am also a huge fan of the major cinematic productions based on the story which I have seen over the years Though that doesn't necessarily mean that I like them all.The many different filmed versions of this story are practically uncountable. But of the ones I have seen only the following 8 bear a serious look Under the title of 'A Christmas Carol' there was the 1938 version with Reginald Owen as Scrooge and the madeforTV productions 1984  With George C. Scott 1999  With Patrick Stewart more recently 2004 with Kelsey Grammar Officially titled 'A Christmas Carol The Musical' and the 2009 animated version with Jim Carrey. Under the title 'Scrooge' there's the 1951 version  With Alistair Sim as Scrooge the 1970 musical with Albert Finney and this rather obscure 1935 version which I would have to rank at 6.Sir Seymour Hicks was knighted in 1935 but it couldn't have been because he was a good actor. Not having not seen any of his other film appearances I have only this one to judge his talent on and his performance here was a big disappointment. I can't even say that his acting was consistent for in some scenes Hicks acts as though he'd memorized his lines just before his scenes were shot and took little if any time to work on characterization. In others his actions are somewhat jerky and he spits out his lines with hardly any emotion and in still others he overacts which is almost as bad as not acting at all.Donald Calthrop plays a barely acceptable Bob Cratchit. He looks a bit too old for the part and his acting is below average at best. Robert Cochran appears briefly as Scrooge's Nephew Fred but does well with his short screen time. Also in brief but notable performances are Mary Glynne as Scrooge's lost love  Belle and Barbara Everest as Bob Cratchit's Wife both of whom do well with what little they've got to work with.The 'Rag and bone shop' scene is my favorite in this movie though that's not saying much. Hugh E. Wright Athene Seyler Margaret Yarde and D.J. Williams  as 'Old Joe' 'Scrooge's Charwoman' 'Scrooge's Laundress' and 'The Undertaker' respectively do okay but other interpretations of this scene in other productions are much better.Jacob Marley  Scrooge's 7yearsdead partner  Is seen only once and very briefly. His confrontation scene with Scrooge later is not nearly as terrifying as it should have been for reasons that will be obvious when you see it. Much greater care should have been taken in the portrayal of a character as important to this story as Marley. I realize that special effects were by comparison primitive in those days but it seems that something could have been done to make this important scene more believable.I was very disappointed almost to the point of sadness with Oscar Asche's performance as 'The Spirit Of Christmas Present'. This character is supposed to be a gentle jolly giant but Asche makes him a disgusting slob. He delivers his lines as though he's reading them from a cue card and keeps losing his place. Perhaps he was a better Actor on the stage with Shakespearean roles but here he turns what is supposed to be quite a likable character into someone you'd try to avoid.If you're as big a fan of Dickens' story and characters as me you might want to see this version just out of curiosity. And by all means please do! Just don't expect much and you won't be as disappointed as I was.".

Unfortunately it came via the trimmed 60minute version included as a supplement on VCI's 2Disc Set of the definitive 1951 adaptation  though ironically I came upon a copy of the complete 78minute print the very next day! Curiously enough while this particular narrative has been adapted to the screen countless times its plot has rarely been updated or altered in this respect most versions could well be deemed superfluous...except that the intrinsic moral lesson is so timely that filmmakers constantly feel the need to remake it this line of thought was understandable back in the old days when DVD or even TV wasn't available  but now I find the concept unfathomable and even punishing since no one can hope to surpass the aforementioned classic with Alastair Sim! Anyway the 1935 film itself emerges to be an unsurprisingly faithful rendition of the Dickensian tale actually the lead actor  Sir Seymour Hicks  had already appeared in a 1913 Silent version! Still unsurprising is the key word here granted the plot is so wellstructured and engaging that one can't help watching especially during this time of yearbut it's also so inextricably familiar that one tends to become impatient during expository passages fully anticipating the next dramatic highlight or famous line. Ironically even if this version is shorn of some 20 minutes there's still a bit of padding  particularly the bludgeoning message inherent in the scene where the scraps of a royal banquet are flung out on the street to be picked up by beggars.Hicks himself emerges as probably the least sympathetic Scrooge but at the same time being the right age for the role  unlike most other performers of the emblematic miser figure in hindsight this may be due to the fact that I'm only familiar with his work through this one performance incidentally he coscripted the film himself  though to be fair to him I hadn't watched most of the other versions in quite some time. Similarly the supporting cast doesn't have the many established faces one finds in subsequent versions  which again serves to distance one somewhat from the narrative's desired effect that said the Ghost Of Christmas Present is played by Oscar Asche  coauthor of CHUCHINCHOW a stage musical whose 1934 screen adaptation via VCI's surprisingly generous 3Disc Set preceded this very same viewing! Artistically therefore the 1935 SCROOGE is workmanlike if nothing more the silhouetted Ghost Of Christmas Future is rather effective  but then Jacob Marley's ghost is heard but not seen! it's unfortunate too that the outdoor nighttime scenes on this particular print were excessively dark.".

	schema:headline " First talkie movie version";
	schema:reviewBody "Being a big fan of the classic Dickens story I have decided to watch all the movie and cartoon versions and share my views of them here starting with the first motion picture talkie version this 1935 British movie starring Sir Seymour Hicks.Lets start out with the negatives of this production starting with what's missing from Dicken's story. Much from the Christmas past chapter is missing and I find it to be the most important of Scrooge's visits from the spirits. There is no trip to Eb's old school and his love for discovering the classics no Sister Fan's visit to take him home and more importantly no Fezziwig. Without the old Fezziwig party scene we lose Scrooge remembering what it was like to feel joy again and how well his old boss treated him as opposed to how he treats his man Cratchit. Two points that make Scrooge's transformation much more believable.Christmas past does include the scene where the love of his life Belle lets him go however this scene comes off as laughable. Instead of having a younger actor portray young Ebenezer they put a dark haired wig on Hicks and have an older woman portray Belle. The acting in this scene is too over the top and the music is overbearing and silly.A big letdown in this version are the ghosts. Christmas present is the only one of them visible and his entrance contains the spirit devouring a turkey leg while speaking his lines. He's like a Shakespearian General Bulkhalter from Hogan's Heroes. And although we do see Jacob Marley's face on the door knocker for some reason he's invisible in Scrooge's chambers.One of the best points of the movie is in just about every scene included from the book the dialog is very faithful. The only scene really where it is not is the Marley scene where they cut about a page of text. They take out the part where Marley puts the scare of Scrooge by moaning and rattling his chains until Scrooge believes in him. I think it is very important to the story.I also like very much the Cratchits in this one. Bob and his wife may be a bit older than they should be but I think they play the parts well of a tattered and torn family just getting by and not letting their circumstances break their spirits.As for Scrooge himself Seymour Hicks's acting overall is good. But I think he makes just an OK Scrooge. There's something about him A bit Sterling Hollawayish that makes him a peculiar choice for the part.All in all I barely gave it a 7. Points earned for close Dicken's text Hick's acting and for the Cratchits. On the minus side a few points taken away for Marley's ghost and Christmas past.".

	onyx:emotionText "Being a big fan of the classic Dickens story I have decided to watch all the movie and cartoon versions and share my views of them here starting with the first motion picture talkie version this 1935 British movie starring Sir Seymour Hicks.Lets start out with the negatives of this production starting with what's missing from Dicken's story. Much from the Christmas past chapter is missing and I find it to be the most important of Scrooge's visits from the spirits. There is no trip to Eb's old school and his love for discovering the classics no Sister Fan's visit to take him home and more importantly no Fezziwig. Without the old Fezziwig party scene we lose Scrooge remembering what it was like to feel joy again and how well his old boss treated him as opposed to how he treats his man Cratchit. Two points that make Scrooge's transformation much more believable.Christmas past does include the scene where the love of his life Belle lets him go however this scene comes off as laughable. Instead of having a younger actor portray young Ebenezer they put a dark haired wig on Hicks and have an older woman portray Belle. The acting in this scene is too over the top and the music is overbearing and silly.A big letdown in this version are the ghosts. Christmas present is the only one of them visible and his entrance contains the spirit devouring a turkey leg while speaking his lines. He's like a Shakespearian General Bulkhalter from Hogan's Heroes. And although we do see Jacob Marley's face on the door knocker for some reason he's invisible in Scrooge's chambers.One of the best points of the movie is in just about every scene included from the book the dialog is very faithful. The only scene really where it is not is the Marley scene where they cut about a page of text. They take out the part where Marley puts the scare of Scrooge by moaning and rattling his chains until Scrooge believes in him. I think it is very important to the story.I also like very much the Cratchits in this one. Bob and his wife may be a bit older than they should be but I think they play the parts well of a tattered and torn family just getting by and not letting their circumstances break their spirits.As for Scrooge himself Seymour Hicks's acting overall is good. But I think he makes just an OK Scrooge. There's something about him A bit Sterling Hollawayish that makes him a peculiar choice for the part.All in all I barely gave it a 7. Points earned for close Dicken's text Hick's acting and for the Cratchits. On the minus side a few points taken away for Marley's ghost and Christmas past.";

	schema:reviewBody "If there's a lesson to be learned from the countless adaptations of A Christmas Carol it's that the makers should stick to the text as closely as possible. Dickens barely wasted a word in his novella it being a perfectly judged perfectly paced bit of fiction.This adaptation takes a few wrong turns. It takes far too long before we get to the actual haunting with the first 30 minutes being positively meandering. There's also a perfunctory sequence featuring none of the main characters where the King is celebrated. Maybe this kind of thing pleased the masses back in the thirties but it does make the opening act a bit of a slog.One would hope that things would get back on track when Jacob Marley appears. Unfortunately Jacob Marley doesn't appear at all he's a rather unimpressive voiceover. It's an odd choice as if the makers aren't confident enough to give us a character design that will work for us.Unfortunately the sequence following this isn't much better. The visit from The Ghost of Christmas Past is done and dusted in less than 5 minutes I'm not exaggerating. There's nothing of Scrooge of a boy no mention of Fezziwig and we only really see the breakup of his relationship with Belle and nothing of the good times Scrooge shared with her. This is a major misstep as it fails to adequately give us Scrooge's backstory. Considering what is included in this adaptation it's baffling that such a key segment was skipped over. I'm wondering if it was abridged so that they'd be no need for other younger actors to play Scrooge but that seems like an unnecessary compromise.The Present and Yet To Come sequences fare better and the conclusion to the story is really rather good as adaptations of the novella go. However the damage has already been done.It's a big shame as the cast are fine. Seymour Hicks may be a touch too shabby for my tastes as Old Scrooge but he's able to give us a decent contrast in his performance even if his redemption is far too quick and seems almost complete after a quick glimpse at his past.In summary this is probably on an even footing with the Reginald Owen offering from just three years later 1938. Both have as many flaws as aspects to recommend but both are worth a watch to aficionados of the classic story.".

	schema:reviewBody "I bought the Legend edition which presents both the colorized version and the original black  white from 1935. Seymour Hicks is among the first actors to play Scrooge on sound films and remains one of the more successful. A look at IMDb reveals a Homeric catalog of great actors who have played Scrooge over the years on TV or in film Fredric March Basil Rathbone Albert Finney Tim Curry Michael Caine Patrick Stewart Jim Carrey among many others. Alistair Sim in the 1951 version and Reginald Owen in the 1938 MGM version of course stand out amid this panoply. Lionel Barrymore was supposed to do the MGM version but became unavailable for health reasons. Still he went on to do many a radio version of Scrooge which can be heard today on cassette or CD. About the version by Hicks he was 64 when he made the film younger than the 51 of Sim and Owen when they made their versions a more appropriate age for the role. He had played Scrooge on the stage for years beforehand but he never quite shuffled off the theatrical acting style he was used to. Note how he rolls his eyes in his bedroom scenes when the ghosts come visiting. Still he does a masterful job of portraying Scrooge as a miser. He is probably the most disreputable dirty looking Scrooge you will ever see a shambling wreck of a man badly needing a bath haircut and a new wardrobe. Eating his cheap meal in a restaurant he takes his change and doesn't leave a tip much to the scorn of the waiter. It's amazing that he has a housekeeper who serves him his breakfast. Even some misers have their indulgences. I recommend this film as I would a Shakespeare play performed by different actors. Each actor brings something new to the familiar story each production brings something novel and interesting. The Dickens story is timeless.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are many films that have been made over the years of the classic Charles Dickens story about the miserly Scrooge and his miraculous transformation on Christmas Eve. This 1935 British version has quite an antique feel to it especially when compared to the 1951 Alastair Sim film. This film moves quickly but still faithfully portrays Dicken's tale adequately. Sir Seymour Hicks transfers precisely Dicken's portrait of the cantankerous old pennypincher who reforms after the visitations of four ghosts and guarantees a bright future for Tiny Tim and all the Cratchit family. I quite enjoyed Donald Calthorp's portrayal of Bob Cratchit bringing dignity patience and the gentleness of the man whether at home with is loving family or in the cold cruel office of Scrooge  Marley and finally bravely dealing with Tiny Tim's death in the ghostvision scene being observed by Scrooge. As I previously stated the film has an antique feel partially due to it's age and by technical standards it is not perfect. Nonetheless this  Scrooge  has it's own charms is finely played and carries on at a pace which nicely conserves the Dickensian's classic Christmas story. If you are very fond of early films and A Christmas Carol you may find this version entertaining and interesting.".

He'd played the role over two thousand times on the stage before making his initial film version in 1913 for which he himself wrote the scenario. He'd no need to write the script for this one which follows Dickens so faithfully it even uses the novelist's own dialogue. To put it simply Hicks is Scrooge to the letter. The other characters are likewise faithful transitions and all are superbly brought to life here. Produced on an admirably lavish budget the movie is brilliantly directed by Henry Edwards who imaginatively takes full advantage of the many prodigiously decorated sets. The music score is also a standout. In all this is a truly moving yet spirited production that cannot be faulted even by the most fervent Dickensian.

Stinky is an avid collector of music boxes and has several quite expensive pieces in his vast collection. The previous night someone broke into his flat and knocked him unconscious when he tried to intervene. All they took however was a simple wooden music box he had bought at auction that day for a mere 2. The box was one of three available for sale and as Holmes and Watson begin to trace the other purchasers it becomes apparent that someone will stop at nothing including murder to retrieve all three. When Holmes learns the identity of the music box maker he is convinced it contains directions to the retrieval of something very valuable that the government has kept from the public.";

When an old school friend of Dr. Watson is found murdered Sherlock Holmes immediately suspects that this has something to do with his latest collector's item purchase namely a wooden musical box.

True the valuableobjectshiddenatdifferentlocations premise is somewhat similar to the previous Holmes film The Pearl of Death and may therefore come across as unoriginal but the screenplay contains more than enough variety to make The Secret Code another very compelling mystery film. Holmes female opponent for example is a truly clever woman who nearly succeeds in setting a trap for our brilliant detective during a very wellmounted sequence. Furthermore The Secret Code I refuse to use the completely irrelevant title Dressed to Kill is fastpaced and contains loads of terrific dialogues. As usual Bruce's character Dr. Watson provides the story with a couple of neat comical moments most notably the scene in which he tries to comfort a little girl who just got traumatized by imitating the sound of a duck...impressively I may add.".

It's not the worst one in the series as some people think but it's not riveting either and I can see why the guys decided to pack it in after this one. The end of World War II also signaled the end of this series as a number of them were WWII stories.It was a wonderful ride.

It's not the worst one in the series as some people think but it's not riveting either and I can see why the guys decided to pack it in after this one. The end of World War II also signaled the end of this series as a number of them were WWII stories.It was a wonderful ride. I own all of them in the series and have a high regard for everyone connected with the set. I still think Rathbone is THE Sherlock Holmes and always will be.";

This well directed mystery is captivating from beginning to end.  Rathbone and Bruce have obvious movie chemistry in this caper.  Patricia Morison is delightful to watch in a brilliant performance as Holmes' foe.  Edmond Breon as 'Stinky' steals every scene he's in.

Dressed to Kill tells the story of three music boxes whose history begins at England's Darthmor Prison where they were all made by the same inmate. Together their similar musical tunes hint at the location of stolen five pound note printing plates that the Bank of England fears may erode the British economy if they are used to flood the country with illegal tender.Holmes' chief protagonist in this case goes by the name of Hilda Courtney Patricia Morrison who cleverly baits him into a trap as she bears down on the remaining music box in Holmes' possession. The only problem I have with the film is the rather easy way in which the kidnapped Holmes manages to secure the key to the handcuffs he has been bound with.I'll assume that the title Dressed to Kill refers to the rather elegant attire of Ms. Courtney even though one of her disguises placed her as a charwoman.

	schema:reviewBody "The final film of the Universal series of Sherlock Holmes films with Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce was DRESSED TO KILL. It is not one of the best films but in this series even a below par film is better than many other similar B film mysteries. Rathbone and Bruce play the Detective and Dr. Watson with all the ease and in Rathbone's case personal contempt of dealing with a pair of old friends. The familiar face of Dennis Hoey as Inspector Lestrade is missing. Interestingly the authors of the series included another one of the Doyle story Inspectors Stanley Hopkins  here Carl Harboard as the link with the Yard. Hopkins for those who are not in the know appeared in four of the short stories after 1905. He's not the only link to the made up story here.Mrs. Hilda Courtney was a former actress and she is the villain in this film abetted by Colonel Cavanaugh and Hamid  Frederick Worlock and Henry Cording. Worlock had appeared in TERROR BY NIGHT as the math professor who gives Nigel Bruce a hard time when the latter makes the error of trying to question him while not being a policeman. He was also Philip Musgrave in SHERLOCK HOLMES FACES DEATH. Cording appeared as the owner of the pottery factory which made the busts of Napoleon in THE PEARL OF DEATH and earlier was the sea captain and member of the Good Comrades in THE HOUSE OF FEAR. Mrs. Courtney was portrayed by Patricia Medina. Ms Medina is one of the tragic waste stories of Hollywood. Terribly attractive sexy and with a wonderful voice and stage presence she is remembered for her originating the role of Kate in KISS ME KATE by Cole Porter which she did not do in the movie version  Kathryn Grayson did  but fortunately did on television which version survives. While she had a fine stage career Hollywood ignored her. And as a result this film may be considered her best remembered film performance. She is properly sexy and dangerous here. Mrs. Courtney is not a character from the Holmes stories but she is a type of substitute clone not quite though for Irene Adler in A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA the first Holmes short story and the only one where Holmes does not quite win. Due to Adler's success Holmes frequently thinks of her as The Woman which is mentioned in this film. Adler in the original was blackmailing the King of Bohemia but here Mrs. Courtney has eyes on a bigger deal. It seems that her gang has possible access to a set of plates for the printing of perfect duplicate five pound notes. If they get the complete set it can rock the British economy.Somehow I suspect the plot line here was based on some knowledge by the script writers of a Nazi scheme called Operation Reinhart. The scheme was created by the evil Reinhart Heydrich creator of the Final Solution and victim of an assassination style execution in Czechoslovakia in 1942 that led to widespread reprisals see HANGMEN ALSO DIE or HITLER'S MADMAN. He planned to get perfect replicas of British currency printed in Germany in the millions and than flood the British Isles with them to ruin England's economy this was told in the comic series PRIVATE SCHULTZ with Ian Richardson back in the 1980s. The scheme never got anywhere  except the perfect bank forgeries were created.The plates turn out to be hidden in music boxes similar to the Borgia Pearl in THE SIX NAPOLEONS and the film version called THE PEARL OF DEATH. Gradually it becomes a battle that Mrs. Courtney keeps winning against Holmes in trying to find the missing plates. In the course of the story an obscure poison almost does in Holmes and Watson as in the story THE ADVENTURE OF THE DEVIL FOOT ROOT. It again is due to a comment that Bruce's Watson says that Holmes finally solves the case. I will only add that Watson and Bruce being Scotish is a bright man at base even if he eats oats a food that is eaten by men in Scotland and horses in England.".

The scheme was created by the evil Reinhart Heydrich creator of the Final Solution and victim of an assassination style execution in Czechoslovakia in 1942 that led to widespread reprisals see HANGMEN ALSO DIE or HITLER'S MADMAN. He planned to get perfect replicas of British currency printed in Germany in the millions and than flood the British Isles with them to ruin England's economy this was told in the comic series PRIVATE SCHULTZ with Ian Richardson back in the 1980s. The scheme never got anywhere  except the perfect bank forgeries were created.The plates turn out to be hidden in music boxes similar to the Borgia Pearl in THE SIX NAPOLEONS and the film version called THE PEARL OF DEATH. Gradually it becomes a battle that Mrs. Courtney keeps winning against Holmes in trying to find the missing plates. In the course of the story an obscure poison almost does in Holmes and Watson as in the story THE ADVENTURE OF THE DEVIL FOOT ROOT. It again is due to a comment that Bruce's Watson says that Holmes finally solves the case. I will only add that Watson and Bruce being Scotish is a bright man at base even if he eats oats a food that is eaten by men in Scotland and horses in England.";

In an almanac there was a line about his villain roles. I supposed he ought to be an ugly villain even a fat and ungainly one. Therefore later upon seeing him as Holmes in the wellknown Holmes exploitation flicks I often found myself wondering if I find him of some physical beauty.His Holmes flicks are averagely successfulwith the performances being sensibly better than the flicks. Their charm is real and convincing.These adaptations do unexpected illicit justice to Watsonshowing him as funny and kind and harmless he is more delightful than Rathbone himself.It's good they have chosen an athlete for Holmes mostly because this athlete was the unique Rathbone. On the other hand Rathbone's performance simple unadorned straight virile without whims and antics is right and satisfying. His Holmes is physical athletic lessinward looking than that of others' hence also considerably less decadent than that of the stories . Doyle is better than the adaptations yet the Rathbone flicks are a honorable amusement and also a plausible reading of the literary sources. I have written elsewhere about the disingenuous fact of asking from these movies things they are not meant to have. The '60s TV shows the Simon Templar Roger Moore flicks the Lugosi movies etc. are on various degrees on various steps of the scale honoring their vows. It is unfair to ask for subtler more original things FROM THEM as if they were supposed to be what they are not. They fulfill their functionalbeit it is a modest unassuming one.

The script by Leonard Lee based on the novel 'The Adventure of the Six Napoleons' by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is a good solid mystery that focuses on the finding of plates to print money rather than focus on the murder aspect. It moves along at a nice pace is never boring  is engaging but it tends to lose credibility as it goes on. Why for instance go through all this trouble to relay a simple message? Why not just visit Davidson in Dartmoor prison  let him tell you verbally where the plates are? Why not send the message in one go? Colonel Cavanaugh states that he received a message about the music boxes too late to buy them in the auction so there are obviously less complicated ways to communicate with each other. I just don't buy the fact that they need to go through all this trouble to relay one simple location I really don't. The climax is very rushed  abrupt as well. Having said that it makes for good entertainment is a good way to pass 70 minutes  has a few nice twists turns  doubles crosses.Director Neill was a old hand at these Holmes mysteries by the time Dressed to Kill was made  the film is well made but probably won't impress too many people these days. The usual horror overtones are almost completely absent apart from Hamid Harry Cording the knife throwing killer there really isn't much here. For some reason he lets the viewer know who the villains are straight away so the mystery element is also severely compromised.Technically Dressed to Kill is well made with nice black and white photography good production values  suitably ambient sets. The acting is good although you can see that Rathbone was beginning to get bored apparently four more Holmes films were in production but he said he was 'immensely tired' of playing Holmes  they were never made obviously. Bruce as Watson plays it for laughs again Patricia Morison as the main villain Hilda Courtney does well.Dressed to Kill isn't the best of these Holmes mysteries but it's far from the worst.

	schema:reviewBody "When Watson is visited by an old school friend Stinky' he is told of how the friend's house was broken into and only an old music box stolen and the rest of his valuable collection left untouched. Holmes is intrigued but thinks no more of it until Stinky is murdered and another identical music box stolen. Holmes traces the music box back to one of three made by a prisoner in Dartmouth prison. Assuming that the music boxes are carrying some message Holmes races to stop the gang from killing any more people in their quest for the boxes.I have seen many of the original Holmes films and enjoy the formula and the style of many of them. However this one is a little below the average for the series but was still enjoyable nonetheless. The plot is a little thin and suffers for it it takes too long to really get going with Holmes not coming into it strongly until 20 minutes in. The actual plot is a little iffy as it is simply VERY unlikely and doesn't really grip at any point. It even lacks the usual humour that is laced within it. It is still enjoyable but it is below the standard set by the series as a whole.Rathbone is on good form but the trail of logic that Holmes must follow is clearly a series of big jumps rather than small logical steps and he can't quite manage to carry it off. Bruce is as good as ever and is comical the only downside being that he plays he as a buffoon of sorts rather than anything approaching Holmes' equal. The baddies' are very much of the rent a master villain' variety and don't stick in the mind likewise the police officers are without any of their own characters worth mentioning. However Rathbone and Bruce are the focus and do pretty well.Overall this won't win any new fans over but it may please fans of the series. However even those who are fans may be a little disappointed here.".

	onyx:emotionText "When Watson is visited by an old school friend Stinky' he is told of how the friend's house was broken into and only an old music box stolen and the rest of his valuable collection left untouched. Holmes is intrigued but thinks no more of it until Stinky is murdered and another identical music box stolen. Holmes traces the music box back to one of three made by a prisoner in Dartmouth prison. Assuming that the music boxes are carrying some message Holmes races to stop the gang from killing any more people in their quest for the boxes.I have seen many of the original Holmes films and enjoy the formula and the style of many of them. However this one is a little below the average for the series but was still enjoyable nonetheless. The plot is a little thin and suffers for it it takes too long to really get going with Holmes not coming into it strongly until 20 minutes in.

One minor quibble is that the method the bad guys use to try and dispose of Sherlock seemed unnecessarily risky when they had guns and could've just shot him. But this sort of logic flaw is not exclusive to this film or series. Movies in general have always had this problem. The James Bond series has thrived on it for fifty years. The Rathbone films are all good and I would recommend everybody try them out. If you're a fan of the Doyle stories and consider yourself a purist however you will probably be disappointed.

Dorothy Lamour in all her beauty made the most of her Carlotta. Two cameos in the film were notorious because they are uncredited and unexpected Alan Ladd and Bing Crosby. Others in the film are Peter Lorre Lon Chaney Jr. Charles Dingle Frank Puglia Reginald Denny among the supporting cast.The film is still a lot of fun as it makes fun of other more dramatic movies thanks to the direction of Elliott Nugent.";

Paramount's new logo has only 22 stars. I am not sure when that was changed but certainly by the mid fifties.Interestingly this movie has a speaking part for an African American man and an Asian American woman in the first five minutes of the film. Neither gets screen credit. There is also a child actor who chews up the scenery that scenery being Bob Hope's finger.It is nice to see Bob Hope actually climbing a tree. Bob was in excellent physical shape in those days of the 1940s. If you want to watch him dancing watch The Seven Little Foys where he tap dances with Jimmy Cagney during the mid 1950s.It is fun for those of us who remember dictaphones and wire recorders and disc recorders that made big 78 rpm records as we watch Bob trying to operate a recorder. Where were the digital MP3 recorders when you needed one in 1947? The cars are fun to look at. This is like a trip to a museum with an old friend.One scene I ran back and forth a few times and I have not yet figured out how they did it. There is a scene where Bob is the target for a knife thrower. I think they really threw the knives and barely missed his head. It looks real to me.Not Bob's best movie but worth a look. I recommend Paleface Fancy Pants Son of Paleface Seven Little Foys Beau James and That Certain Feeling.Tom Willett".

	schema:reviewBody "My Favorite Brunette shows that the parodying of film genres did not start with Mel Brooks or even with the Carry On films. Ronnie Jackson is a San Francisco photographer specialising in taking pictures of babies. His great ambition however is to be a private detective and hopes to be taken on as an assistant by Sam McCloud a private eye whose offices are in the same building as Jackson's studio. McCloud has always resisted but one day Jackson gets his big chance when he is mistaken for the great man by a potential client. A young woman named Carlotta Montay asks Jackson whom she believes to be McCloud to trace her elderly husband who has mysteriously disappeared. Jackson eagerly accepts the assignment.The rest of the plot does not really matter. It concerns a battle to control the mining rights to uranium deposits in South America. The whole point of the film is to parody the film noir style of filmmaking particularly films based on hardboiled detective stories like The Maltese Falcon or The Big Sleep. I am informed that the film to which My Favorite Brunette bears the greatest resemblance is Farewell My Lovely which I have never seen. The film introduces a selection of stock characters from films of this type apart from the private eye himself there is the sultry femme fatale here played by Dorothy Lamour in a move away from her sarong girl image the softspoken but sinister foreign villain played by Peter Lorre parodying the parts he played in The Maltese Falcon The Man who Knew Too Much and other films and the wheelchairbound old man like General Sternwood in The Big Sleep. There is a typically convoluted noir plot a gloomy Gothic mansion a frantic car chase and the sort of cynical slangy wisecracking voiceover one could imagine being delivered by Humphrey Bogart. The house is so big that you could shoot quail in the hall.The film's central joke is that not only is Jackson not a private eye he is also most unsuited to that particular line of work. He is a character of a sort played by Bob Hope in a number of his other comedies the man who pretends to be tough brave and resourceful but who in real life is both cowardly and inept. In his work as a photographer he even allows himself to be terrorised by a baby.Seen as a pure comedy this is not the best although there are a few amusing gags such as the lunatic asylum inmates playing golf without a ball Lon Chaney's musclebound but stupid warder a joke at the expense of Hope's oddshaped nose I'll personally punch you in the nose so hard it will look like other peoples' noses and the scene where Hope trying to record Lorre's confession to a murder keeps pulling the plug out of the socket. Anyone however who is familiar with the conventions of the film noir genre will be amused by this affectionate parody. 610.".

Robinson via a dictating machine in Murder My Sweet Philip Marlowe Dick Powell explains his predicament to the police as they thirddegree him in Sunset Boulevard Joe Gillis William Holden explains his conditiona dead body floating in a Hollywood swimming poolto the audience and so on. In My Favorite Brunette baby photographer Ronnie Jackson Bob Hope gives an interview to reporters from death row where he is minutes away from being gassed. Hope wryly comments They don't even have electricity yet. The story Jackson gives the press becomes a humorous satirical spoof of the genre.Hope was a master of oneliners. One of his running jokes for half a century or more was that he had never received or even been nominated for an Academy Award. While Bob never took his film roles seriously he was in fact a great actor as well as one of the best comedians of films radio and television. Others with much less talent that Bob have received that prestigious award. Yet Hope was always taken as a mere funny man by the Hollywood bigwigs. He was a consummate entertain who could sing and dance act tell jokes you name it.It's good to see Hope in action on the screen. My Favorite Brunette is a place to see him at his best. The Road Pictures were entertaining and parts of them will still bring out the belly laughs but because of the topical nature of much of the humor parts of them are also quaint and somewhat silly by today's standards. That they still work at all is due in large measure to the chemistry between Hope Crosby and Lamour. Bob was always best when he worked alone. Before his humor dried up with changing times and he ended his film career with a few turkeys too bad for he truly deserved so much more he made many of the best comedies of his era.My Favorite Brunette is filled with wit and clever lines from a cast that includes Dorothy Lamour who is given an opportunity to go beyond her Road Picture image and show genuine acting talent Peter Lorre who is as always creepy and sadistiche also doesn't like to be called Cuddles by HopeLon Chaney Jr. a much underrated actor who was always in his father's shadow and Jack La Rue whose face the viewer is sure to recognize. Plus there are two significant cameos that add much to the total effect of the film.Hope usually played the same type role in films no matter what name was given him. The average American could readily identify with his character traits. Though he was a coward an unsuccessful womanizer and a braggart he was also lovable patriotic and at heart a pleasant guy. In My Favorite Brunette Ronnie Jackson is telephone sitting for a private detective when a gorgeous client walks in. As a result Jackson gets overly involved in a kidnapping murder case that eventually lands him on death row. How he gets out of this mess makes for the hilarious hijinks that keep the audience rolling.".

Like a lot of the entertaining movies made by pure entertainers including the many HopeCrosby films this one is a thin contrived and fun plot. The plot is a twisting parody of detective movies a vehicle for gags and stunts and oneliners.We could stop this review there and most people would know whether to see it and whether they'd like it. If all these names are unfamiliar just picture a 1940s black and white musical without the music and dance. You aren't meant to care about the characters not deeply or even what happens very much. You just go along from situation to situation enjoying the company of some talented and likable folk.Like Bob Hope. Some people might find his sharp edge a little cold and that he's full of himself without the selfdeprecation that makes other comics warm and lovable. But he is up for anything and he's nonstop which is part of the fun trying to keep up with all the lines. In fact you could easily watch it twice in a row just to get all those jokes you missed the first time.The plot here is complicated on purpose but the key setup is having a baby photographer Hope mistaken as a detective which he always wanted to be. He gets in the middle of a crazy plot filled with further mistaken identities and of course a woman who is part femme fatale and part heroine. And yes she's brunette played by Dorothy Lamour a longtime partner in crime with Hope and Bing Crosby. In fact her inclusion and the title is part of a great number of inside jokes which the public well aware of the three of them would probably get including a reference to FBI director J. Edgar Hoover who was perhaps romantically involved with Lamour.Hoover brings to mind the right wing tendencies of all these people and with Hope's longstanding Republican flair which was openly part of his persona. He was a huge supporter of the troops in WWII like everyone else of course but he was actively entertaining them like no one else and so was Lamour by way of the pinup. None of this taints the movie if you are of a different persuasion but you might see the references differently if you catch them. Most of the time though it's just funny plays on words and twists of meaning all ticklish or hilarious or both.".

	schema:headline " When Hope Met Hitchcock";
	schema:reviewBody "On the streets of San Francisco a mysterious woman named Carlotta appears out of the blue asking a man to help her. He's not really a private detective but he's so swept off his feet he acts the part anyway. Then her story unravels. He suspects her sanity not realizing he's only one step behind her en route to the sanitarium.Nutty as a fruitcake but with all that beautiful frosting! That's not James Stewart talking about Kim Novak but rather Bob Hope on the subject of Dorothy Lamour his costar in this farcical takeoff of the film noir made more than ten years before Hitchcock's Vertigo. Maybe the Master should have called it Deja Vu instead.That's not entirely fair. Vertigo is a classic on many levels whereas My Favorite Brunette is an amiable timekiller with Hope solid if not sharp making the best of an uneven set of wisecracks and a wrongman story even weaker than the one Carlotta spins at the outset. Still Peter Lorre is on hand to lend the film some Hitchcockian gravitas as one of the key hoods and the opening set up showing Hope at San Quentin telling his tale to reporters as he awaits the gas chamber gets things off right.Hope is Ronnie Jackson a baby photographer whose office is next door to a detective he idolizes. The detective chooses to leave Ronnie alone in his office just as Carlotta walks in to tell of a man who is either her husband her uncle or neither hand him a ring and a map and lead him on a chase involving keyhole cameras and invisible golf balls which pits him against Lorre Ol' Shortenin' Bread Ronnie calls him slick southerner Charles Dingle Mint Julep and muscle man Lon Chaney Jr. Boulder Dam with legs.Seeing Hope's mocktoughguy persona go through the paces of a Raymond Chandlerstyle potboiler is fun. He's all show but never learns to the point that when he jumps a middleaged woman in one scene the joke isn't him losing so much as him thinking he could win.In the beginning we see him on Death Row asking the warden about a reprieve from the governor No word huh? Well I'll know who to vote for next time. Every time he smokes a cigarette he tries to sneer at the guard only he ends up nearly coughing instead.Director Elliott Nugent keeps the story moving which helps with the holes but the filmnoir mood he establishes at the opening quickly dissipates into a shooting gallery for Hope's oneliners. Edmund Belion and Jack Rose the screenwriters miss a good opportunity to use the story as more of a sendup. Alas the mystery is played too much on the level and except for some reaction shots from Lorre we never see the villains as part of the comedy.But it's Hope it's the 1940s which means you are in for a good time. Plus one thing Vertigo didn't have a terrific last line. Watch it once and it will be the biggest smile you take away from this underbaked charmer.".

He's not really a private detective but he's so swept off his feet he acts the part anyway. Then her story unravels. He suspects her sanity not realizing he's only one step behind her en route to the sanitarium.Nutty as a fruitcake but with all that beautiful frosting! That's not James Stewart talking about Kim Novak but rather Bob Hope on the subject of Dorothy Lamour his costar in this farcical takeoff of the film noir made more than ten years before Hitchcock's Vertigo.

Hope is joined by an excellent cast that includes Dorothy Lamour in the femme fatal role Peter Lorre as a knifethrowing killer and Lon Chaney Jr. as a simple but ultimately kind gangster whose efforts to help Hope only seem to get him in deeper. The whole supporting cast is great. And director Elliott Nugent keeps the pace flowing with never a dull moment. In fact it's a first rate job from everyone involved.

Admittedly that could be because I'm a fan of all the performers but it's definitely a worthwhile purchase now that it's available at a budget price on DVD. Bob Hope reliably plays the part of a fulltime photographerparttime detective but I must admit the supporting players amuse me most. Lon Chaney and Peter Lorre make terrific villains particularly when sharing the screen together. Midway through the film they hold the fort at an asylum where Bob Hope and Dorothy Lamour are being held prisoner. In probably my favorite scene Chaney is eating in the kitchen while helping Lorre study for his American citizenship exam. Lorre impatiently quizzes him on the three levels of government while Bob and Dorothy try to escape without being seen. Dorothy makes it but Bob is cornered by Lorre and makes the same mistake he has before calling him Cuddles. Lorre objects to the nickname which sends him over the edge. He responds by tossing several kitchen knives in Bob's direction with menacing accuracy. Even though the camera doesn't catch Lorre in motion there's a humorous tension that adds authenticity to the moment and though Chaney plays a backward character he's smart enough to know when a man's in danger sending a loaf of bread into Bob's hands when the knives come too close for comfort. You can picture what will happen from there. The action never slows down for a minute. The dangers continue in this fast paced film and though formulaic in many ways it's like going on a roller coaster ride...you know where you're going but it's fun getting there. The witty dialog and oneliners keep on coming and there's a comical resolution near the end. It's worth a first viewing at least even if you don't want to go back to it as often as I do.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a great opportunity for getting a first eye view about a civilization and a culture so completely different from ours that it's worth the price of admission.Living in the remote Gobi desert we encounter a small family that live from the sheep they raise and their camels that are used as a form of transportation. The living conditions are primitive to put it mildly yet the family in the film seem content with what they have to live with. Most of the activities are centered around the home.As the film unfolds we are witnesses to the amazing birth of the last colt of the season. It is an ordeal for the first time mother having this offspring  a labor that goes on forever until the men of the village take matters into their hands and help with the birth. The white colt that is born in front of our eyes has to be guided to the mother for his nourishment only to be rejected by her. We watch as one of the women manages to milk the mother camel in order to feed the colt. When all fails as the mother camel keeps rejecting the colt they resort to a sort of a ritual that involves a violin player coming to the family's help to play music for the animal and ultimately mother and son are miraculously reunited.The views of the desert are beautiful in their remoteness and desolation. Somehow we are drawn into this family's life in a way that we never thought we could get to know anyone. The final irony is that after the young children go into the nearest town they finally see their first television broadcast and are fascinated by it. The film is refreshing as it shows how the different members of this small family care for one another. They are fortunate indeed because being away from all the consumerism and material things they manage to stay focused in living under those conditions in that unfriendly environment.".

The subtle mixture of their traditional pastoral existence e.g. yurts herding gathering fuel etc. with that of the modern e.g. the musician brings his morinkhuur Mongol Viola to camp on a motorcycle to perform an ancient ritual is marvelously done.The Mongol Bactria's camel nomads are rather marginal to the great majority of pastoralists many of which still herd their sheep on their stout Mongol horses.

Not only that but labor for two days to get the young colt out and then do it standing up? It's a very dramatic intense fiveminute scene one I won't soon forget.For most of this film however not much happens yet it does have a certain appeal. I had read how fantastic the scenery was but outside of the snowcapped mountains in the background the terrain is flat and totally bleak. Living in this vast desert is almost depressing. Imagine living in that barren land year after year? For the family featured in this film it didn't seem bad. They didn't know any other way of life and they seemed quite content.However as we see near the end of the movie not everyone in that area lives in a sturdy tent and raises sheep and camels. There is a store miles away and schools and music and dance classes etc. The little boy in featured family is awed when he sees a television set. He wants one of course. The grandpa tells the boy he'd just sit around and watch TV all day and that would be bad. In the end though the movie concludes with a shot of a huge satellite dish outside the tent! The story is basically about how the family figures out who to get the mother camel to nurse its young one and yes there is a happy ending.Summary a likable film but you must be patient with it.".

	schema:headline " A Mother Camel Rejects its Newborn";
	schema:reviewBody "This is an amazing documentary! It's very real very authentic and gives the viewer an intimate look into the lives of a Mongolian family four generations living on the edge of the Gobi desert deriving life and existence from their animals camels sheep and goats. Although they seem primitive to us they are very creative and accomplished in the task of survival in a very bare and isolated area. We see their close attachment to and understanding of their animals and they take very seriously the difficult birth and later rejection of a white newborn by the brown mother. In nature sometimes for obscure Darwinian reasons the mother sometimes rejects the newborn offspring. Maybe it was the difficult and prolonged birth. Maybe it was the unusual white color of the colt.The family tries every which way to get the mother to suckle the colt but they are unsuccessful. They try ritual prayers. Finally they try a timetested remedy and that is a melody more specifically music from a medical musician a particular specialist with the violin. Sure enough after requesting the 'consultation' the violinist comes with the indigenous violin a primitivelooking two stringed instrument but it produces soothing and mesmerizing music! This together with the whole large family watching the beautiful young woman stroking and singing brings about the desired result. The mother is actually weeping and allowing its offspring to suckle! It seems like a miracle but also very natural. How did the Mongolian family come to this wisdom?We cannot help but identify as human beings with some mothers rejecting their babies. Sometimes healing interventions bring about rapproachment. Sometimes it is an extended family and sometimes it is therapy. Psychotherapists have something to learn from watching this extraordinary film closely and deeply. What we see is something at the core of the human condition. This documentary will be understood by bright children as well as perceptive and intelligent adults.".

I can't remember being so totally awed by a movie. This film demonstrates the strange bond every conscious creature enjoys with every other creature in a mystical yet very real way. If there is a God it intended us to see and feel this movie. We are supposed to listen and see not just to watch. This is the story about a family who lives by the land and their camels are the very platform of existence on the steppes. What is amazing to learn is that here animals are not merely useful servants but rather to live together and be prosperous an understanding is required. How and why this understanding takes place is mysterious as the universe and rarely seen in our massproduced lives.

	schema:reviewBody "Set on the edge of the Mongolian desert THE STORY OF THE WEEPING CAMEL tells a deceptively simple tale while examining a way of life that is coming to an end. It focuses on four generations of a nomadic Mongolian family of sheepherders dwellers in iglooshaped tents called yurts that have brightly coloured interiors and sturdily resilient exteriors. The family is close knit respectful of one another and seeming to possess an inner peace that seems mockingly unattainable to us in the frenetic materialistic western world. With no mod cons they entertain each other by singing songs and telling tales and playing simple games and all generations of the family gather to eat their meals at a table. Relying on camels for transportation the family work hard to assist a firsttime mother complete a particularly difficult and graphically filmed birth. The white colt that finally emerges however is shunned by its mother and doomed to a lingering death if the family cannot persuade the mother to allow him to suckle.This is one of those films that slyly draws you in. Initially I wondered how such a story would ever keep me absorbed for its running time and then it seemed as if the final credits were rolling. Billed as a 'narrative documentary' it's in the mould of Robert Flaherty's silent classic NANOOK OF THE NORTH using real Mongol nomads to effectively play themselves in a planned story. It's a practice that in this case works particularly well. The action  such as it is  always looks natural and unforced even when it concentrates on two of the family's young children and their trip to the 'big city' and you half expect David Attenborough's hushed tones to chime in at any moment. Even when there's nothing much going on the movie is never anything less than beautiful to look at narrative and dialogue are frequently put on hold as we are treated to richly detailed studies of shimmering mountain sunsets the play of the wind in sand dunes and even the seamed and aged faces of the eldest members of the family. The plight of the colt is portrayed as merely a problem that needs to be solved and is touchingly told without resorting to sentimentality or tearjerking melodrama. And there is a curious beauty buried deep within these comically designed beasts that is effectively captured when we see them entranced by the music of the wind playing through the strings of a violin.The difficult relationship between mother and colt contrasts with the harmonious relationship between the human members of the family and the creeping influence of television and consumerism contrasts with the simple way of life the family leads. That last jarring shot outside the family's yurt really is a something of a sad image with which to leave us arousing feelings of anxiety for the future of such a gentle society  and for the past they are leaving behind.".

It is beautifully photographed I actually sat there teary eyed at points remembering my own travels. The storm scenes. . .if only you could feel and smell it. It is like you are being nailed by a sand blaster the smell has a static electric feel to it and frankly after a day or so makes you feel a bit crazy I did not blame that little girl at all for crying. . .and it also ruins your camera equipment unless you seal everything in zip lock bags. I've lost two cameras and two camcorders there due to weather. One detail I noticed was the cameraman filming with his back to the wind. If he had turned the camera into the wind it would have blasted the lens within seconds. Just to capture it at all on film was quite a feat. Two of my trips over there we had a documentary team with us and both times their equipment failed within days. So the team that made this film. . .just from the technical logistical side an amazing feat.The music well in the film it is captivating haunting and believe me to hear the songs again. . .yet another teary eyed moment for me remembering sitting under a star studded sky and hearing the same songs while the bowl of fermented milk goes back and forth and then we guests sing our songs in reply fortunately my one friend does dooop and our Mongolian friends just adored The Lion Sleeps Tonight I did that darn wenawop line as his back up every night til it drove me crazy! And wherever we traveled word of us raced ahead and wherever we stopped our new found nomad friends would ask sing Lion song! Drove me crazy! Yet again back to the film. I just wish there was more of their traditional music it is wondrous haunting. Do notice in particular the scene where the musican first hangs his two string fiddle on the camel's hump and then let's the wind play it. Nearly all traditional mongolian music is a reflection of natural sounds right down to differences of the wind on the desert versus grasslands or the forest and in the northern regions the beat is almost always that of horse hooves. There is another documentary out there on throat singers I can't remember the title but do try and see it.But back to the film again. Wonderful delightful share it with your kids and afterwards do think about it.

	schema:reviewBody "At the beginning of The Story of the Weeping Camel a film that chronicles the daily life of a family of shepherds in the Gobi Desert of Mongolia one of the elders tells the story of the weeping camels. At one time he says a camel loaned his antlers to a deer but they were never returned causing the camels to look to the horizon with tears in their eyes hoping that their antlers will be returned. It is the spring and the time for camels to give birth. One of the camels has a painful birth and the family members help the distraught camel by pulling a beautiful white colt from her womb.Almost immediately it seems that the camel has rejected her young for reasons unknown but perhaps because it was such a difficult delivery. Although the members of the clan make every effort to bring the mother and her offspring who they have named Botok together their efforts produce no results and the picture of the baby wandering alone longing for his mother is heartbreaking. The film however is not a sad one. It radiates the purity of the simpler life that has gone on for centuries and the ties that nurture a family their responsibilities and the traditions that they share. Great grandmother Chimed cooks the milk and cares for the family's young granddaughter while her mother Odgoo works with the animals and the family treats the young lambs as pets.Nothing works to bring mother and baby camel together until an ancient ritual is performed. The family's two young sons Dude and Ugna are sent on a trip by camel of what appears to be several miles to the regional tribal center at Aimak. There they request that the music teacher come to their tents to perform a ritual where the teacher will play the violin and the boys' mother will sing to the camel. The ritual was learned by Luigi Falorni a film student in Germany from a fellow student a Mongolian and they both traveled to the Far East to make the film in the tradition of Robert J. Flaherty's Nanook of the North.At Aimak the boys are introduced to a touch of the modern world  TV motorcycles and computer games. Ugna buys an ice cream and batteries for his grandfather and when he comes home he sheepishly asks his family if they would buy him a TV. The ritual performed by the family and the music teacher highlights the healing traditions that families in the area have used for hundreds of years and it is soothing and quite beautiful. The Story of the Weeping Camel is very slow perhaps too slow for some children yet is a wonderful learning experience of nurturing and how other cultures live the feeling of community and how healing can be performed in ways other than taking two pills before bedtime.".

Kurosawa elevates a story that could have been simple melodrama to the level of masterwork with a genuine love of his characters and with an incredible technical direction.  The film's structure accentuates and deepens its many many lessons on life and the performances including a heartbreakingly earnest turn by Shimura are all flawless.In short Ikiru is easily one of the greatest works committed to film and no discerning film aficionado should avoid experiencing it.  Had Kurosawa directed only this film it would still be enough to include him in the pantheon of the greatest storytellers who ever lived.

	schema:reviewBody "Ikiru is a film about life. Constantly complex and thoughtprovoking although simple at the same time it tells a story about life's limits how we perceive life and the fact that life is short and not to be wasted. Our hero is Kanji Watanabe the most unlikely 'hero' of all time. He works in a dreary city office where nothing happens and it's all very meaningless. Watanabe is particularly boring which has lead to him being nicknamed 'The Mummy' by a fellow worker. He later learns that he is dying from stomach cancer and that he only has six months to live. But Watanabe has been dead for thirty years and now that he's learned that his life has a limit it's time for Watanabe to escape his dreary life and finally start living. What follows is probably the most thoughtful analysis of life ever filmed.Ikiru marks a departure for Akira Kurosawa a man better known for his samurai films but it's a welcome departure in my opinion. Kurosawa constantly refers to Watanabe as 'our hero' throughout the film and at first this struck me as rather odd because as I've mentioned he's probably the least likely hero that Kurosawa has ever directed but that's just it! This man is not a superhero samurai but rather an ordinary guy that decides he doesn't want to be useless anymore. That's why he's 'our hero'. Kurosawa makes us feel for the character every moment he's on screen  we're sorry that he's wasted his life and we're sorry that his wasted life is about to be cruelly cut short. However despite the bleak and miserable facade that this movie gives out there is a distinct beauty about it that shines through. The beauty emits from the way that Watanabe tries to redeem his life because we feel for him and are with him every step of the way it's easy to see why Watanabe acts in the way he does. Ikiru is a psychologically beautiful film.It could be said that the fantastic first hour and a half is let down by a more politically based final third  and this is true. The movie needs it's final third in order to finish telling the story but it really doesn't work as well as the earlier parts did. However Kurosawa still delights us with some brilliant imagery and the shot of Watanabe on a swing is the most poetically brilliant thing that Kurosawa ever filmed. Together with the music and the rest of the film that you've seen so far that picture that Kurosawa gives us is as moving as it is brilliant.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Ikuru' Japanese for 'To Live' was one of Kurosawa's personal favorites. Prominent film critics worldwide put it along with Seven Samurai and Rashomon on their lists of the best films ever made by anyone. When first shown in the USA during the 1950's  all three quickly earned widespread critical acclaim and strong patronage. USA film enthusiasts by then had clearly grown weary of the tired formulas followed by Hollywood studios in the timid postwar years. They welcomed the more thoughtful and challenging films from Kurosawa and from other acclaimed film directors in Japan Ozu and Misoguchi Italy Rosselini De Sica France Troufault Bresson and England Lean. All of these great film directors were also able to hold and move their audiences while developing somber themes. 'Ikuru' however is even more deeply philosophical than any other film that I recall by asking what is needed for us 'to live' well.Takashi Shimura gives an absolutely convincing performance of a tired old man numb and alone. After learning he has terminal cancer he learns that dissipation offers no solution. Then he clings to a cute vivacious girl taking her to shops and restaurants. She wearies of his dreary cringing manner but agrees to have one more dinner together. In the powerful climactic scene at the restaurant he learns why she is happy in her new job packaging toys. 'I feel all the babies in Japan are my friends!!' This gives him an idea. He too can do something to help children. 'There's still time!!' he cries and runs off while she stares in bewilderment. He keeps moving quickly towards his cheerful new life. Shimura reminded me of Albert Camus' essay 'The Myth of Sisyphus.' Sisyphus plods off to yet another day of struggle but has won over the gods after all because he is aware of his quest. 'We must imagine Sisyphus happy' urges Camus. We must also feel the same for the old man in Ikuru when we see how he is reborn and truly alive for the first time.".

	schema:headline " The examined life...";
	schema:reviewBody "This great film by Kurosawa is probably less well known than his Samurai tales but is none the worse for that. The film is both long and slowpaced but the impact is incredible.We begin with 'our hero' as Kurosawa calls him Watanabe's stomach xray and we are told that he has cancer. We then see Watanabe sitting at his desk in the Tokyo city civil service slowly marking a great pile of papers with his little rubber stamp. He sits at the head of a group of people doing much the same thing shuffling papers from one place to another and we are told that he has been doing this for 30 years! We see a group of ladies complaining about stagnant water directed from one office to another as the bureaucratic machinery churns mechanically onwards.Against this background Watanabe goes to the doctor with his stomach complaint. He meets a strange man who precisely describes Watanabe's symptoms and tells him that the doctors will lie to him as the disease is terminal. This comes true and Watanabe realises that he is to die soon. The stunning waste of his life then becomes apparent to him and in a really powerful scene he falls asleep crying below a commendation from the office for 25 years of service. He isn't worried by dying rather he's worried by never having lived. He stops going to work he buys expensive sake and goes to the bright lights but this fails to make him happy. He then spends time with a young girl from the office and it is on an evening out with her that he realises what he must do. This realisation is combined with a roomful of people singing 'Happy Birthday' for a friend...but it is clear that they are singing for Watanabe's rebirth. Watanabe goes back to the office and picks up the file concerning the stagnant water...he is determined to do something about it after 30 years of doing nothing!The next section of the film is the real key to its impact. We are at Watanabe's funeral with a number of the technocrats from the City Council. My expectation was that they would all be complimenting the memory of Watanabe and his achievement in clearing the stagnant water and building a park in record time...but they aren't!

	onyx:emotionText "This great film by Kurosawa is probably less well known than his Samurai tales but is none the worse for that. The film is both long and slowpaced but the impact is incredible.We begin with 'our hero' as Kurosawa calls him Watanabe's stomach xray and we are told that he has cancer. We then see Watanabe sitting at his desk in the Tokyo city civil service slowly marking a great pile of papers with his little rubber stamp. He sits at the head of a group of people doing much the same thing shuffling papers from one place to another and we are told that he has been doing this for 30 years! We see a group of ladies complaining about stagnant water directed from one office to another as the bureaucratic machinery churns mechanically onwards.Against this background Watanabe goes to the doctor with his stomach complaint. He meets a strange man who precisely describes Watanabe's symptoms and tells him that the doctors will lie to him as the disease is terminal. This comes true and Watanabe realises that he is to die soon. The stunning waste of his life then becomes apparent to him and in a really powerful scene he falls asleep crying below a commendation from the office for 25 years of service. He isn't worried by dying rather he's worried by never having lived. He stops going to work he buys expensive sake and goes to the bright lights but this fails to make him happy. He then spends time with a young girl from the office and it is on an evening out with her that he realises what he must do. This realisation is combined with a roomful of people singing 'Happy Birthday' for a friend...but it is clear that they are singing for Watanabe's rebirth. Watanabe goes back to the office and picks up the file concerning the stagnant water...he is determined to do something about it after 30 years of doing nothing!The next section of the film is the real key to its impact. We are at Watanabe's funeral with a number of the technocrats from the City Council. My expectation was that they would all be complimenting the memory of Watanabe and his achievement in clearing the stagnant water and building a park in record time...but they aren't! I was frustrated...I wanted them to recognise that he knew he was ill and fought the established order so as to achieve something with his life.As they drink more and more they begin to reflect on what Watanabe had achieved. They become emotional realising that he knew he was ill and realising that with determination the system can be used to achieve things.

Fans of the late Japanese legend might cite The Seven Samurai or The Hidden Fortress while critics believe that it should be Rashomon or Ran.A growing band of Kurosawa worshippers has recently named Ikiru as his indisputable masterpiece. Unfortunately I don't see myself joining the latter soon. Yes Ikiru is Kurosawa's most deepest and reflective film though in my opinion it's far from the masterpiece that it's touted to be. Ikiru is a film best described as 'a game of two halves'. The first hour is vintage Kurosawa. It starts out with an Xray image of a stomach diagnosed with cancer and then introduces the film's pitiful lead character Kanji Takashi Shimura to the viewers. Kanji is a government official who has been loyally serving his department for many decades.Upon receiving news that he's suffering from terminal cancer he decides to take an extended break from work which he has never done before to reflect about his life. After some inner soul searching Kanji realized that he has been missing out on life since he began working. He sets himself on a quest to live out his final months with a motto I cannot die until I'm satisfied with my life.Cancer has taught people that life cannot be taken for granted. Kanji is a character that we can all relate to from his humble personality to his simple outlook on life. Kurosawa cajoled out a magnificent performance from Shimura not only was Shimura able to make us feel sympathetic toward his character but his character was also able to earn our admiration by the end of the picture.However Kurosawa is no Yasujiro Ozu Tokyo Story Late Spring. Those familiar with the works of these two Japanese legends will know that Ikiru is the kind of story that Ozu would have relished. Kurosawa is simply not as capable in handling intense dramatic material as Ozu. This is perhaps the reason the second hour of the film fails to capture the greatness of the first. Kurosawa focused too much on the bureaucratic aspects and its faceless officials during the long funeral sequence than Kanji's final farewell gift to the community after an immense struggle involving politics and red tape.Ikiru's lackluster second half dilutes the film's emotional value. Kurosawa did not have an off day it's just that he was too ambitious to have attempted such a complex urban drama though his ambitions have often led him to more successes than failures in life.GRADE B www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com All rights reserved.".

The material is certainly moving but the movie is stilted and static the performance of the main actor is of one note and the dialogue explains often what is obvious to the viewer.

	schema:reviewBody "There are good very good and even great movies. But among them there are just a few that go beyond great. They belong to the league of their own. Akira Kurosawa's Ikiru To Live 1952 is one of them. The film of rare humanity profoundly moving and often funny Ikiru tells the story of a dying man's last crusade that turned out to be his triumph the best thing he had ever done in his life something he will be remembered for. The film reveals both absurdity of life and the ability of man to find meaning in it through selfless action.Two years before he played the tough lead in Seven Samurai Takashi Shimara gave even finer performance in a very different role as a government bureaucrat Kanji Watanabe who seemed to lead a life of quiet desperation at his job and at home. Then he learns that he has terminal cancer and faced with the fact of death he first tries to take from life as much as possible and spends the half of his savings on gambling drinking and women. It leads him nowhere and gradually he determines to achieve one good thing before he dies and settles on converting a junkyard into a playground for children. Rather than make a feel good movie with coworkers helping Kanji Watanabe in his quest and his family around him at his last moment Kurosawa portrays him as a lonely crusader  no one can understand why this park is so important to him. The answer is very simple  he does not have time and he wants to live to see the park open. His family and coworkers don't even know how ill he is what makes some scenes even more powerful and poignant. His words I am not angry with anyone I have no time for that the look at his face when asked by a mafia member if he did not care for his life  the film has many quiet but compelling moments like these.For me watching Ikiru was as close to earth shattering experience as it goes. I think it is one of very few films that could really change one's life. I could not help comparing it to Cries and Whispers  how devastated I was by the theme of inevitable death how ugly it is and how helpless we all are while facing it. Ikiru is about a dying man too but how hopeful and life affirming it is. The film did not tell or teach me something I had not known before but it confirmed once more that it is never too late to do something even if you have only few months to live.".

More emotionally effective would have been to actually witness the protagonist perform his life altering bureaucratic heroics himself. Well to be fair Kurosawa actually did show some of it using flashbacks...It seems that Kurosawa has a fetish for flashbacks as seen in Rashomon as well. Yet those scenes in Ikiru were pretty much protagonist merely nodding and begging in apologetic manner. I found that less than convincing way to get the job done... or to achieve a legacy for that matter. Oh well at least they played Pachinko and visited a strip tease show. But couple breaks from tedium and the life altering philosophy just couldn't save the film from its slow pace predictability and dare I say rather mediocre cinematography. I'll give it 510.".

The opening few scenes depict a group of empowered local women appealing to various bureaucratic departments to clean up a polluted residential playground in their neighbourhood. They are sent hither and thither to various departments to no avail until Watanabe decides to use his clout to see the park restored to its natural state.Several scenes stand out as memorable In the earlygoing Watanabe's son and young wife or fiance come home only to see the ghastly figure of Watanabe staring blankly in the darkness of their room. The expression on his face conveys his emotional state so well.Later on Watanabe is confronted by some threatening gangsters opposing his desire to clean up the park. One of them warns Watanabe that he is risking his life. Watanabe could not be happier to hear this and smiles jubilantly at the gangster. The gangsters up to this point very tough and menacing are startled and confused at Watanabe's sheer disregard for his own life.Lastly you should really just watch the movie there is the scene of a drunken Watanabe tearfully singing a mournful song accompanied by a jazz pianist. This is perhaps one of the most beautiful scenes in all of Kurosawa.".

	schema:reviewBody "I suppose it isn't truly a spoiler to say the main character Watanabe dies of cancer at the end of the film. For most directors this probably would have been a overly sentimental death drama. Kurosawa is far to talented and sophisticated for such triteness. This is a rich meaningful touching story of a man's attempt to live. The themes of this film are so universal we can access it even 50 years after its release. Several good films have been made along similar themes. Wild Strawberries is one of the best. I have not seen Umberto D. but I understand it is very similar. Bergman and Kirusawa are very similar filmmakers. Bergman seems to me to be more metaphorical and Kirusawa is more aesthetic. They are both superb writersdirectors. Ikiru is a heavy layered film. After listening to the commentary on the Criterion Edition you learn that this film makes many significant social comments on Japanese life. At the same time as I said earlier the emotions and themes of this film are ubiquitous. You don't have to possess a knowledge of 1950s Japanese politics to understand it. You simply have to be human and possess a desire to live a meaningful life. There are many images from the film that linger with you. Kirusawa like Bergman and Hitchcock was so good a composition. His films are so visually active that you can know everything you need to know without the dialogue. However the dialogue is simple and very effective. The characters talk the way normal people talk yet the say things normal people don't say. That to me is great dialogue. I was disappointed in the film stock from which the DVD came. It was not in good condition. That is a real shame. I am not sure why that is. Criterion does great work with the classics. They must not have been able to obtain anywhere near pristine stock. This is such a beautiful film. It would great to see it from the original negatives.".

This becomes very apparent once he finds out that he is dying from stomach cancer and has only months to live.Now so far this does NOT sound like a movie most people would want to see. However instead of dwelling on death and the meaningless of life Kurasawa goes beyond that. Much of the movie actually focuses on this man trying to find meaning in his life and ultimately deciding to devote his final days to fighting for the creation of a park in some godforsaken part of Tokyo. Despite a general atmosphere of apathy he ultimately succeeds in getting the park created.About 23 of the way through the picture the man dies. I thought the movie was over but then it cuts to a scene at his funeral. A group of bureaucrats and the deputy mayor attend but few others. What happens next is important as the movie becomes very philosophical and those in attendance begin to ponder his life and their own as well.In many ways this movie is both uplifting and cynical. I won't say much more but encourage you to see it for itself. I will say though that unlike Bergman's films which often have talked about death or mental illness Ikiru is unusual in that it seeks meaning and goes beyond life is meaningless and then you die.".

They have a ton of cheapo DVDs in a big crate. You can get 5 DVDs for 10 dollars. I also picked up a gem called The Crippled Masters a 70s KungFu Revenge flick and yes they are crippled. But I'm getting way off on a tangent...The Last Woman on Earth is an interesting film with some unintentional laughoutloud parts. What's interesting about it is how well mannered they are during the end of the world. There are two males and one female left alive after some kind of doomsday devise is detonated which is never really explained. In this type of scenario you'd expect people to behave wildly looting the electronics store stealing Italian sports cars driving a tank through the middle of downtown as I believe this happened in a film called The Quiet Earth. Instead they wear pressed slacks shave mix cocktails no one explains how they still have power let alone ice cubes and fight over one boat in a harbor full of 'em. This is not Corman's most entertaining film and you will find your attention slipping in and out but for my money it beats the latest sitcom or reality show.".

	schema:reviewBody "On the 5th of April 2005 the legendary horror producerdirector Roger Corman turned 79 years old and that was my reason the obsessive geek I am to rewatch one of his most overlooked films. Last Woman on Earth is a modest but ingenious SFthriller that got pushed back and eventually forgotten due to other bigger cinema projects handling about the same topic. That's quite regretful as this is a well written and entertaining little film with quite some tension and above average acting performances. The plot is fascinating and follows a rich couple and their lawyer friend on vacation in Puerto Rico. When they make a daytrip out on the open sea to dive a sudden and unexplainable lack of oxygen kills off the isle's entire populationlikely the whole world! They initially collaborate to survive and work out an escape plan but pretty soon the first fights appear. The situation gets really complicated when the lawyer also develops feelings for  the last and only woman on earth. Like nearly every Roger Corman product the film lacks budget and eye for detail. Yet the Puerto Rican filming locations are beautiful the man's directing is very straightforward. The constantly increasing hopelessness of the characters is terrifically portrayed and the inevitable climax of paranoia is very impressive. The ending is somewhat disappointing as other reviewers already pointed out and hard to accept after the overall convincing first hour. But then again it's not easy to shoot an appropriate climax to an apocalypticminded movie is it? The threeheaded cast delivers good performances. Especially compared to that other film Corman quickly shot in Puerto Rico  Creature from the Haunted Sea  this is a good and recommended picture. Pay close attention to Robert Towne by the way. Around the time of Last Woman on Earth he was still an unnoticed Corman pupil but he soon after became one of Hollywood's most praised scriptwriters.".

In fact it was one of four 3 originally helmed by Corman and another by himself which he was commissioned to extend for TV showings ironically these alternate versions have since virtually become the official ones! I do not know which scenes Hellman devised for the film but it was interesting to note the cockfight in the very opening sequence given that he would make the screen's best depiction of this violent sport with COCKFIGHTER 1974  which Corman himself would produce! Incidentally when I acquired the film under review I was unaware that it was supposed to be in color though by all accounts this had faded anyway in surviving prints had I known however I would have made it a point to check out the version recently broadcast  in the original language  on latenight Italian TV!Anyway though the title had always struck me as intriguing preceding THE LAST MAN ON EARTH by 4 years the film was slapped with an unflattering  but in retrospect undeserving  BOMB rating by the Leonard Maltin Movie Guide. Curiously enough the picture it was shot backtoback with i.e. the recentlyviewed CREATURE FROM THE HAUNTED SEA 1961  another Corman effort 'doctored' by Hellman and with which this shares its three leads  rates 12 in Maltin's book but it is a much less rewarding experience in my opinion! Yet one more picture made during this time and using the same locations was the war movie BATTLE OF BLOOD ISLAND 1960 which however Corman only produced  collectively the films would come to be known as The Puerto Rican Trilogy and they were released as such on DVD as well.To get back to the matter at hand the plot of this one is pretty spare a crooked businessman Bogie lookalike Anthony Carbone his girl Betsy JonesMoreland and his lawyer Edward Wain aka renowned scriptwriter Robert Towne who also penned this convene in the South American town to discuss his latest indictment However while taking some time off deepsea diving the entire world population apparently expires from radioactive fallout hence the title! Needless to say Carbone is not the easiest guy to live with so Moreland finds solace in the younger and more genteel Wain. This of course does not sit well with his 'boss' so we are treated to the usual eternal triangle dilemma albeit set against an apocalyptic backdrop  this idea in itself would have been great had it not been already dealt with the previous year in THE WORLD THE FLESH AND THE DEVIL which actually added a racial issue to the fray and is a film I also own but have yet to watch but then Corman was wellknown for his shrewd commercial sense in concocting a quick cashin to the next big thing notably the reincarnationthemed THE UNDEAD 1957 following hot on the heels of the criticallylauded THE SEARCH FOR BRIDEY MURPHY 1956! Unfortunately the narrative sticks to this one rather drab situation and perhaps in view of the limited setting as well does not develop further when Corman and Towne could pretty much have gone in any direction imaginable given Carbone's selfconfidence and ruthlessness would it not have been logical for him to turn megalomaniacal rather than merely jealous! The latter stages in fact have him banishing Wain from the hotel they were living in but the latter and Moreland doublecross him by leaving together. He sets out in pursuit and finally confronts his romantic rival in a fortress a good setpiece with the unexpected  and strangely moral  ending then relocating to the inside of a church as would THE LAST MAN ON EARTH itself oddly enough! where the herointerloper dies soon after going blind from having received numerous blows throughout in the region of his eyes! and the 'blessed' couple can have a go at saving their marriage!".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a somewhat interesting film about 3 people trapped on the island of Puerto Rico after what seems to be a poisonous gas kills everyone else on the island and potentially the planet Earth. Our protagonists have survived because they were using deep sea diving equipment at the time. Unfortunately 1 woman and 2 strongwilled men is not the ideal combination for endtime fun and games at least not for these 3 in particular.Harold Anthony Carbone who gave his best performance in another Cormandirected film A Bucket of Blood is a nefarious industrialist of some sort who we meet as he and his wife Evelyn Betsy JonesMoreland are joined by their lawyer Martin screenwriter Robert Towne appearing as Edward Wain at a brutal cockfight. Harold is an alpha male if I ever saw one in a film he accepts the catastrophe immediately and starts making plans to escape to northern Canada because he's afraid that flies will feast on the corpses in PortAuPrince and spread contagion to the 3 survivors. To that end he forces Martin to help him prepare supplies study navigation and learn fishing. Poor Eve on the other hand is just a factor in his plans and not a fullblown partner. She grows agitated and speaks her mind telling Harold he doesn't seem to realize that it's not the same world any more. Martin seems to feel the same way implying to Harold that they could share Eve but Harold's not having any of that. This combined with his seemingly neurotic need to continue working on the trip even when it serves no purpose other than to keep them occupied makes Harold somewhat unsympathetic to the audience some of the other posters have even referred to him as the bad guy although I would disagree. After all most people would at least like to cut loose if they were the last people on Earth and this guy just doesn't seem to know how to have fun. But the script is clever  our sympathy never really rests with either man but usually with Eve herself. Eventually she comes to see Martin as a deadend  she finally gives up on him when he dismisses the idea of having children and says that he and Eve should simply fade away as painlessly as possible. Eve starts to swing back towards Harold at this point despite his violent outbreak against Martin because at least Harold wants to keep fighting for the value of his life which feels better despite probably being ultimately just as pointless as Martin's nihilism and worldweariness.This is basically the kind of movie that a bigname filmmaker like Robert Towne would probably look back on with at least some embarrassment. But given the resources that went into making this film which I would guess had 4 or 5 days' shooting time it's not an embarrassing film at all. Towne's performance isn't in the same league as Carbone's but I've seen a lot worse. The script itself is pretty good. I found the scene with Eve and Martin on the balcony towards the beginning very interesting.Corman has nothing to be embarrassed about either here. It's hard to judge the film's beauty in some ways because the print that was used for the DVD is so degraded that the parts near the beginnings of the reels might as well not be in color. But this film is a good example of how Corman uses available public resources like beaches and old castles to make his film more interesting visually than it deserves to be based on the budget. The whole thing also flows much more smoothly than most of his films from even just a few years previously.When all's said and done it's a film that I will probably rewatch a few times in my life but not something that I'd tell everyone in the world or even my closest friends to rush out and buy.".

Eventually she comes to see Martin as a deadend  she finally gives up on him when he dismisses the idea of having children and says that he and Eve should simply fade away as painlessly as possible. Eve starts to swing back towards Harold at this point despite his violent outbreak against Martin because at least Harold wants to keep fighting for the value of his life which feels better despite probably being ultimately just as pointless as Martin's nihilism and worldweariness.This is basically the kind of movie that a bigname filmmaker like Robert Towne would probably look back on with at least some embarrassment. But given the resources that went into making this film which I would guess had 4 or 5 days' shooting time it's not an embarrassing film at all. Towne's performance isn't in the same league as Carbone's but I've seen a lot worse. The script itself is pretty good. I found the scene with Eve and Martin on the balcony towards the beginning very interesting.Corman has nothing to be embarrassed about either here. It's hard to judge the film's beauty in some ways because the print that was used for the DVD is so degraded that the parts near the beginnings of the reels might as well not be in color. But this film is a good example of how Corman uses available public resources like beaches and old castles to make his film more interesting visually than it deserves to be based on the budget. The whole thing also flows much more smoothly than most of his films from even just a few years previously.When all's said and done it's a film that I will probably rewatch a few times in my life but not something that I'd tell everyone in the world or even my closest friends to rush out and buy.";

Yet these three works happen to be very different and for that reason all interesting in a different way. The first one is set in a huge city reinforcing the feeling of desolation and claustrophobia and approaches the question of racism since one of the only humans left is an AfricanAmerican man. The third one presents the unique man on earth restlessly fighting a group of zombies called vampires. The second one Last Woman on Earth also deals with three people alone in the whole world and like the World the Flesh and the Devil offers a love triangle or a 2 men1 woman situation. The characters are isolated in Puerto Rico threatened by diseases they want to leave the island but just won't. I don't think action or adventure is focused on here rather the psychological evolution of three people who gradually show a despicable relationship to other humans.In conclusion this movie stands out for its subtle treatment of human desires and the hints it makes to raw capitalism transforming people into mere goods.".

But that 20 minutes could have been cut out  or at least cut down dramatically  and it wouldn't have negatively affected the rest of the movie because it's only after that first 20 minutes that this becomes interesting. And at that point it is interesting.The three go off on a boat trip off the coast of Puerto Rico. Strapping on oxygen tanks they go diving for less than an hour because it's established that the tanks hold an hour's worth of oxygen and when they come up  everyone's dead. The pilot of the boat everyone in Puerto Rico and apparently everyone in the world. Just dead. Something suddenly and briefly sucked all the oxygen out of the air and everyone asphyxiated. Just like that. There are three human beings left on the entire planet. Two men and one woman. You can guess where that's heading.Beyond that 20 minutes I thought this was basically a good movie. The cause of the mass extinction is never explained beyond something taking the oxygen out of the air but it really didn't have to be. That's just part of the mystery. Our three survivors didn't know what had happened. Why should we? I'm no authority on the work of Roger Corman who directed this. I've seen a few of his movies. Some I've liked some I haven't. This would certainly fall into the category of one that I liked. It's intriguing and it's generally well acted by the three leads. 710".

	schema:headline " a lot more interesting than the title and premise might suggest flaws and all";
	schema:reviewBody "What drew me into Last Woman on Earth after the fact that it was included as one of the ten features on a threedisc set of science fiction films for ten cents and was directed by Roger Corman was that the script seemed to be a good deal smarter or at least intriguing than would be expected. As Robert Towne's first produced screenplay he makes it almost like a livingdead movie without the flesheaters. Everyone is dead aside from the three main characters following a short unexplained lapse of oxygen to the planet or rather the little tropic section the characters are at and it leaves the three of them to fend for themselves. But there's a powerstruggle and a sort of existential dilemma to throw out the term once again in the lovetriangle of the husband Harold Anthony Carbone Evelyn Betsy JonesMoreland and Martin Robert Towne credited with an alias there's a code that is attempted to be stuck to but is lost in the face of all lack of humanity left. Sad to the point of denial then acceptance and still denial the three are still caught in the grip of paranoia jealousy and 'everymanforhimself' mentality that would be in a zombie flick though with a lot more at stake with the ambiguity.It might not be Chinatown in terms of overall excellence but it's a script more imbued with ideas and hardboiled dialog for the first twenty minutes it's like a filmnoir with Harold as a bankergambler who doesn't quit at his vices while on vacation and the sexual tension present already between Evelyn and Martin but it's at least a good start at achieving psychological tension for Towne who also as an actor doesn't do too shabbily in delivering some sarcastic and acidic dialog. I also liked how any real explanation as to why there was a depletion of oxygen or why it suddenly comes back on was left out. It adds a level of creepiness in seeing the occasional dead body like the woman on the beach that Martin sits next to and refers to as his 'blind date' to Harold. If anything Towne could've increased the chilling fact of the bodies all strewn about in postasphyxiated form though it goes without saying that the budget was likely too tight to allow many dead extras lying about.Indeed with the lack of any human presence compared to other Corman pictures sandwiched in around the period like Little Shop of Horrors or Creature of the Haunted Sea or rather any of the other films Corman directed that year this is almost Antonioni least in the Bmovie sense. One of the wise things or just practical things that Corman does do aside from his location shooting is to not get in the way of Towne's material much he shoots often very simply with the occasional nifty angle in a beach scene or in the climax when the two men are running after one another in fighting poses. The biggest flaws though as with many of Corman's films come with the acting which is almost as if second rate cuts of Bogie and Bacall were called in by JonesMoreland and Carbone with Towne in also his first acting performance doing possibly just as good if not better than the other two at conveying the dread and melodrama at their situation. This plus Corman's lack of attention to certain things with editing and goofs albeit the print that's available on the boxset is also subpar like Grindhouse quality make it not much greater than the better Bmovies of the period.But as a Bmovie there's ground covered that will intrigue those who are prepared for more than just a simple alien or viral plot or a sexploitation flick. It's also the kind of pic that would probably do very well as a remake it's not too bad on its own but unlike recent films of late which rely on making billions on refashioning past product this could be great without having to be a big moneymaker with a tuneup of sorts.

	onyx:emotionText "What drew me into Last Woman on Earth after the fact that it was included as one of the ten features on a threedisc set of science fiction films for ten cents and was directed by Roger Corman was that the script seemed to be a good deal smarter or at least intriguing than would be expected. As Robert Towne's first produced screenplay he makes it almost like a livingdead movie without the flesheaters. Everyone is dead aside from the three main characters following a short unexplained lapse of oxygen to the planet or rather the little tropic section the characters are at and it leaves the three of them to fend for themselves. But there's a powerstruggle and a sort of existential dilemma to throw out the term once again in the lovetriangle of the husband Harold Anthony Carbone Evelyn Betsy JonesMoreland and Martin Robert Towne credited with an alias there's a code that is attempted to be stuck to but is lost in the face of all lack of humanity left. Sad to the point of denial then acceptance and still denial the three are still caught in the grip of paranoia jealousy and 'everymanforhimself' mentality that would be in a zombie flick though with a lot more at stake with the ambiguity.It might not be Chinatown in terms of overall excellence but it's a script more imbued with ideas and hardboiled dialog for the first twenty minutes it's like a filmnoir with Harold as a bankergambler who doesn't quit at his vices while on vacation and the sexual tension present already between Evelyn and Martin but it's at least a good start at achieving psychological tension for Towne who also as an actor doesn't do too shabbily in delivering some sarcastic and acidic dialog. I also liked how any real explanation as to why there was a depletion of oxygen or why it suddenly comes back on was left out. It adds a level of creepiness in seeing the occasional dead body like the woman on the beach that Martin sits next to and refers to as his 'blind date' to Harold. If anything Towne could've increased the chilling fact of the bodies all strewn about in postasphyxiated form though it goes without saying that the budget was likely too tight to allow many dead extras lying about.Indeed with the lack of any human presence compared to other Corman pictures sandwiched in around the period like Little Shop of Horrors or Creature of the Haunted Sea or rather any of the other films Corman directed that year this is almost Antonioni least in the Bmovie sense. One of the wise things or just practical things that Corman does do aside from his location shooting is to not get in the way of Towne's material much he shoots often very simply with the occasional nifty angle in a beach scene or in the climax when the two men are running after one another in fighting poses. The biggest flaws though as with many of Corman's films come with the acting which is almost as if second rate cuts of Bogie and Bacall were called in by JonesMoreland and Carbone with Towne in also his first acting performance doing possibly just as good if not better than the other two at conveying the dread and melodrama at their situation. This plus Corman's lack of attention to certain things with editing and goofs albeit the print that's available on the boxset is also subpar like Grindhouse quality make it not much greater than the better Bmovies of the period.But as a Bmovie there's ground covered that will intrigue those who are prepared for more than just a simple alien or viral plot or a sexploitation flick. It's also the kind of pic that would probably do very well as a remake it's not too bad on its own but unlike recent films of late which rely on making billions on refashioning past product this could be great without having to be a big moneymaker with a tuneup of sorts. Experimental darkly funny and strangely tragic Last Woman on Earth is one of the better Corman movies.";

The actors don't give the best performances but they definitely have their moments. Even though he is portrayed as the bad guy I really liked and felt sorry for Antony Carbone's character. Robert Towne didn't write the greatest script for this but his character was pretty well acted. As for the last woman herself she was beautiful and fairly talented.

I think the movie is a shocker to those expecting a low budget potboiler with its brain missing. Don't worry. The existential script was written on the go by a young Robert Towne. He also pulls double duty as the odd man out in this fatal love triangle. Filmed in Puerto Rico an unusual decision for the time and possibly prompted by Roger Corman's desire to work on vacation. The results he achieved were nothing short of amazing. No one ever accused Mr. Corman of not squeezing every cent out of a film's budget. The story takes an unusual turn when the three lucky survivors return from a diving outing and find a city of the dead. The character we think is going to be the strong hero reveals himself to be a lazy cynic with no plan of action and eyes for the only woman left in paradise. The use of a modern church the Hilton Hotel and what had to have been an upscale private residence were a nice contrast to the cobblestone streets of the barrio. An ancient fort by the sea is used to great effect during a chase scene. There is a disturbing shot of a dead girl resting against a curb her hand raised to shield her eyes. I very much liked the mellow jazz score. And finally the notion that the world will end in a fiery blast is challenged by simply sucking the oxygen out of air. Different anyway.".

	schema:reviewBody "Max is a former judge who became a cop after he had to turn loose criminals due to a lack of evidence of whom he knew that they committed the crime. He is obsessed with catching criminals redhanded. He also wants recognition or a promotion or something don't remember so he decides to trick some petty thieves led by an old friend of him into robbing a bank so he can catch them weird understanding of justice. He tricks them by starting a relationship with his old friend's girlfriend Lilly who works as a prostitute. He poses as a rich banker and encourages Lilly to think about her future. He hints at a payroll that comes through his bank and knows that she would go to her boyfriend saying that she doesn't want to go on like that and talk him into robbing the bank. The plot works the petty thieves decide to rob the bank and as they do the cops are in place.While this movie is a crime movie parts of it are almost like a heist movie it also has an almost philosophical touch to it and can easily be categorized as a drama. The development of the characters is good and the movie is always interesting.However since one knows in advance what is going to happen one expects a giant twist. Of course this movie is out of the preSe7enpreUsual Suspects era but still the ending is disappointing Max is told by his boss who knows that he set up the criminals that another detective who also knows is going to not only charge those you actually robbed the bank but Lilly also. Max has fallen in love with Lilly who also has feeling for Max. Max goes to talk to the detective and because he would not change his mind he shoots him. This is unrealistic as Max has had time to think what he was going to do if he cannot convince the detective. However the movie implies that his decision is a spontaneous reaction to the detective's reluctance. Shooting him might solve part of the problem since no one else besides the boss and he wouldn't tell knows that Lilly was involved even though there might be files or colleagues could know. But Max now has to face life in jail.That's what I think he as a former judge should have come up with I'm not an expert on French law the movie is set in Paris but I assume that entrapment is illegal in every democratic country. Max could have just said that he entrapped them to rob the bank. That he not just hoped that they would come up with the idea of robbing that bank but that he actually told them to do so. You cannot be convicted for a crime that you would not have committed if the police had not entrapped you at least in America. Lilly and the criminals would go free and he had to face some kind of punishment but not life in jail.Max et les ferrailleurs is a movie with an interesting idea and good performances and it is certainly an above average film. 6.510 ".

	schema:reviewBody "Undeservedly neglected 'Max et les ferrailleurs' is one of the most intelligent splendidly acted and carefully crafted French crime flicks of the 70's. However cataloguing it as just another 'crime flick' would be sacrilegious as it has to offer much more to the patient viewer.Claude Sautet from what I have gathered is known for his dealing with the bourgeoisie's turmoils often depicting complex social dramas in his films. Prior to watching 'Max et les ferrailleurs' I had only seen another great film he made with Michel Piccoli  Les Choses de la Vie which is indeed quite different from 'Max'. The subjects and genres might differ yet Sautet ingeniously manages to create intriguing character studies as both films have fascinating protagonists and while at that to depict perplexing and powerful love stories which help shape the protagonists' moral portraits.I won't insist on the plot suffice to say that the film does not get dull at any time and it also does not fall into a standard clichd policier. Max the protagonist could be compared to Melville's Le Samourai insofar as both are cold meticulous obsessive and enigmatic. The baddies  the 'junkmen' are also well individualized and here I should point out the excellent scene where policeman Rosinsky talks about each of them. Last but not least there's also the divine Romy Schneider between us I wasn't able to take my eyes off her whenever she was in front of the camera.One more aspect that amazed me about the film was the fluent and elegant camerawork which had an immense impact on creating the film's atmosphere. Although I'm not by any means technical literate the composition of the shots struck me as carefully planned and the lightning was spoton.In a nutshell 'Max et les ferrailleurs' is more than you'd be inclined to think it's gritty and elegant at the same time it's brutal and sensual it's a thrilling crime movie and a complex character study in short it is what a good film must be. Don't miss it!".

Complications arise you knew that didn't you? as the girl is attractive and comes with a heart. Max is stoic as well as obsessed and tries hard not to let sentiment interfere with his plan.The film's pacing is uneven and involves a great deal of tablesetting so the film takes a while to get going. All the action takes place in the last 20 minutes  be ready to check your watch several times. But the ending is worth the wait and that's as far as I can go without giving it away. Piccoli gives a thoughtful performance as a man driven by his conception of justice. He is tall and lean and is a commanding presence throughout. Romy Schneider as the bimbo gives what must be her best performance after years of fluff and junk.This was apparently the film's US premiere as it was not shown here in its initial release.

I have to say that I was most impressed by the little girl who played contemporary Lucy. That tot can act! She was cute without being cutesy and solid without being wooden or robotic as some child actors can be.It was fun to see Jamie Donnelly on screen again. Although she has changed quite a lot from her Grease days the voice and the eyes are still the same. Living in a small pop. 3000 town myself I found myself chuckling about the rather clichd town eccentric character Donnelly played and thinking to myself Why OF COURSE there's a town eccentric! But her character was central to the plot and she turned out to be more than I expected.I recommend this film for those who want a spooky yarn without all the slashandgore contemporary film makers seem to think all ghostly tales must have. It does have some bloody moments but compared to most of Let's dismember people films being made today they're not too bad.".

John Stimpson does a great job juxtaposing the family life of a 21st century family with a 250 year old folklore story. Having lived my whole life in New England I could relate to the telling and retelling of old stories and how they become part of the fabric of a small town. The symmetry between Lucy Keyes who goes missing in 1755 and the modern day Lucy who has moved to the countryside with her family is brilliant. I won't give away the ending but the symmetry gathers onto itself as the film continues. And the eccentric character of Caswell fits the small town setting superbly. You will enjoy this film!".

	schema:reviewBody "John Stimpson's The Legend of Lucy Keyes 2006 is a below average script gone wrong. As I sat in the theater two things kept crossing my mind Is this really the same Julie Deply I know from Blue 1993 followed by has it been 93 minutes yet? Legend is about a middleclass family of city dwellers that have just moved to a New England countryside home in support of a windmill project being constructed by husband and father Guy Cooley Justin Theroux. Strange vibes exist from day one when notsofriendlyneighborpig farmer Jonas Dodd Mark Boone Junior refuses to say hello to Guy creating an uneasy tension? later resulting in many weird unexplained scenes including a bloody pigs head on a stick during a casual walk through the woods.Meanwhile Wife Jeanne Cooley Julie Delpy is constantly waking up in the middle of the night hearing voices disguised as wind coming from the woods. Intertwined with her night terrors are flashbacks of her youngest daughter who is now deceased being struck by a car we learn this information through dropped ice cream cones and screeching tires. The only point to establishing a dead daughter as a character is to reinforce the mothers need to keep her surviving children alive as if we sympathize with the mom Jeanne has already lost one daughter it would be a shame for her to lose another. No kidding.It gets worse.Through a town meeting filled with some of the most awkward dialog ever filmed the superstitious ramblings of Gretchen Caswell Jamie Donnelly who is described as a funny looking lady with white hair inform us that Martha's Land where the windmills are being built is haunted by a 250 year old ghost Martha Rachel Harker who is still involved in a never ending search for her abductedmurdered daughter Lucy Keyes.Parallels between Jeanne Cooley and the Martha ghost begin to unfold ...basically their daughters have the same name... which is shown in a flashback yes another one using the combined knowledge of the weknowyou'reindangerbutwhywouldweinformyou townspeople. The flashback depicts a 250 years old scene of alive Martha ringing a dinner bell to attract Lucy's attention followed by Jeanne repeating the scene in present time. Note the exquisite dialogue I got you a gift. You've always wanted a dinner bell The inevitable disappearance of Lucy is delayed for what seems like hours. Finally the Martha ghost this is a ghost story right? appears and flies through a little crack in Lucy's window but instead of grabbing Lucy as any childless mother ghost would just stands still and allows the scary music to play. Eventually Lucy goes missing and a search party is formed just like it was 250 years ago and the cycle repeats itself although no murders of Native Americans take place this time. The difference is almost by some sort of psychic premonition which would have made more sense than the way the scene actually played out Jeanne and Guy find their daughter and finally the madness is over.If my review seems all over the place that simply means I succeeded in conveying the story.But maybe I am being too harsh. There were a couple redeeming qualities of the film and I must give credit where it is due. First off I walked out of the theater much more appreciative of what a good movie actually looks like and maybe the best part of all it happened to be a free screening.".

Prior to the screening the director explained to the audience that it was based on a local legend in his own backyard and because he seemed like a nice guy I really wanted to enjoy it. Sadly there was basically nothing to enjoy  The film is just plain dull that's its main problem. Ages go by with literally nothing important happening and the film is EXTREMELY repetitive. There are endless scenes of the characters tossing and turning while having bad dreams and the movie completely fails to create an atmosphere of dread. Combine that with horrendous acting from the two children and a totally absurd contrived ending and you have a movie that would be better off going straight to video. This is the kind of film that would garner less than a 15 rating on Rotton Tomatoes and anyone saying positive things about it prior to release is probably a studio plant.The Legend of Lucy Keyes isn't entertaining and it's just not scary either. At least not unless your idea of scary is two actors running around aimlessly in the woods for 15 minutes yelling Lucy? Lucy?? Lucy!? a hundred million billion times.P.S. WTF are clam bellies?".

When the ghost of Martha comes to the fields around their property calling for Lucy Jeanne realizes that the legend is true and that there are many hidden secrets in that location.Something is missing to make The Legend of Lucy Keyes a good movie. The direction is too cold and the acting is also cold and without any vibration or heart Justin Theroux and Julie Delpy do not show any chemistry forming a weird couple. The screenplay is confused with Jeanne refusing to go to the mass because she misses Anna but who is Anna and what happened with her? The deranged behavior of Samantha Porter in the end of the story has no explanation. The use of the smell of clambellies to keep ghosts away is unique and ridiculous. In the end I found this Bmovie an intriguing and forgettable entertainment. My vote is six.Title Brazil O Fantasma de Lucy Keyes The Ghost of Lucy Keyes".

When the ghost of Martha comes to the fields around their property calling for Lucy Jeanne realizes that the legend is true and that there are many hidden secrets in that location.Something is missing to make The Legend of Lucy Keyes a good movie. The direction is too cold and the acting is also cold and without any vibration or heart Justin Theroux and Julie Delpy do not show any chemistry forming a weird couple. The screenplay is confused with Jeanne refusing to go to the mass because she misses Anna but who is Anna and what happened with her? The deranged behavior of Samantha Porter in the end of the story has no explanation. The use of the smell of clambellies to keep ghosts away is unique and ridiculous. In the end I found this Bmovie an intriguing and forgettable entertainment. My vote is six.Title Brazil O Fantasma de Lucy Keyes The Ghost of Lucy Keyes";

	schema:headline " John Stimpson asked for my thoughts...";
	schema:reviewBody "I've never written an IMDb review before but at the insistence of director John Stimpson I will tell the world my feelings.This is quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. Stimpson's lack of choices make for a confused genre film that doesn't know if it wants to be a murder mystery ghost story or horror film. Combining these three fields weigh the film down causing it to stumble over its own shoddy progression.The acting is undeniably sophomoric even from the veterans that populate the screen. They careen through the film as if making a TV movie of the week. The frequent chuckles I heard from the surrounding audience makes me feel as if I'm not alone in my thinking. There is way to much running through the woods screaming. At one point I was hoping Robert Stack would emerge and ask for any information to the whereabouts of Lucy Keyes.The direction is stilted and stiff. The use of hand held is meant to loosen up and flow with the characters but feels instead like a contrived way of convincing the audience that the film is tense. Stimpson's film feels like oh so many movies I've watched by 15 yearolds self important and lackluster. The script is amateur in every way from the Cray paper thin plot to the use of swear words. Robert Towne spoke of his film the Last Detail's use of vulgarity as a substitute for action. Here Lucy Keyes uses swearing as a substitute for naturalism. Stimpson believes that if the parents cut loose and let an FBomb fly they'll be more human and believable. Instead each curse reminds me that I'm watching the most pedestrian of filmmaking.As something that wants to be a ghost story horror film and murder mystery the film lacks any scares other than cheap jump scares. The lack of atmosphere in the supposed tense portions of the film makes for a laughable movie. It also diffuses the overall tone making the film feel muddled and unfocused. How anyone could find this film scary is beyond my understanding. The Nickelodeon television series Are You Afraid of The Dark is much scarier and has no use for severed pigs heads.Technically the film is just above competent. The photography is nothing special I believe this is because Stimpson made no choices in preproduction so as to color correct it later. This leaves the photographic images flat and undynamic. Nighttime is blue daytime warm. The editing is uninspired. Its mostly an offender of the editor's bandaid using dissolves and fades to black in an over abundance. The crude use of these fades to black feels more like an area for a commercial break unfortunately none came. I could've used even the most terrible of commercials to break my boredom with this film.What does one do with a film like this? Television? I wouldn't force this on even the most unassuming Lifetime Television watcher. The castration of dignity Lifetime would do to a film like this may be fitting but even that audience would be pained watching this film. DVD? Maybe but what's the point? Lucy Keyes should prepare for a long shelf life.".

Consequently the film is not frightening becausewhere is the menace coming from? Some people would hear the ghost of the 18th century mother calling Lucy! Lucy! during the night and the 21st century mother whilst taking a break from her repetitive tossing  turning once caught a glimpse of her ghost but nothing was done with this glimpse nor did it develop the film at all. The ghosts were almost incidental apart from the next door neighbour using smelly devices to keep the ghost away. Finding a hidden mural is an old and effective device however the director did nothing with the mural that was found under the wallpaper it should have revealed a clue or added to the story rather than merely remaining as background scenery in the room or an occasional talking point.This film is a catalogue of wasted opportunities to add suspense and a sense of mounting fright. Instead the viewer is treated to almost 90 interminable minutes of the ethics of wind turbines and a boringly unstable mother having the same dream over and over while doing some research on the side and eventually wandering through the woods at night calling Lucy! Lucy! in imitation of the mother of Lucy Keyes! I understand that both mothers had a dead child and the modern mother could empathise with the ghost mother and that she would be afraid that her own Lucy would also disappear. Unfortunately she just came across as paranoid with a constant snappy attitude towards her husband.So to sum up nothing interesting happens for 90 minutes and there is not one single scare or suspenseful moment in the entire film!!!!Incidentally the crypt appeared to have drystone walls drystone walls do not remain intact for 200 years without maintenance so I think Lucy's remains would have been found at least 150 years earlier!".

Meeting up with Samantha Porter Brooke Adams his boss and the reason for the move to build a new series of windmills for the town they get the town up in arms over the development. While staying in the house she begins to become tormented by strange noises and visions and even finds a hidden map of the town which she later finds is connected with a child's strange disappearance in her house. Noticing that they're lives are paralleling that of the disappeared children the local legend about a lost child makes her fear for her children's safety especially when it looks close to coming true.The Good News There wasn't a whole lot in here that was all that good. One of the few things is that the woods do look really creepy and spooky. Using the leafless ones with long twigs approach adds immensely to the style giving it a really nice feel and an air of menace. Since just about every time it's featured is due to a nighttime search inside and a little bit of daytime viewing makes them a little creepier than they should. When it finally gets around to it's ghoststory roots it's surprisingly watchable. The main ghost's appearance is pretty creepy a transparent image of a disfigured head with bloody wounds around the face. The fleeting times it's visible it has a great look and a distinctive feel and as it's not overkilled with repetitiveness it hold up better than it should. The one main attack is really good injecting some action into the film and comes the closest to scoring some scares. It's best touch though is the conveyance of pain and anguish over the loss of a child. Not done all that much but it's effectively done here and is used at the right times to get the most out of it. Otherwise this is a really disappointing ghost film.The Bad News This was a really weak and disappointing film. Despite the great premise and oodles of potential possible the result is rather unremarkable. The first flaw is that the majority of the time is spent with subplots that are unrelated to the main intent and have nothing to offer except boredom. The concern of the citizens over the windmills which is clichd in and of itself takes up a lot of time and doesn't get resolved other than a nod that they barely approve of the idea happening in the first place. The struggle to get the family to accept the idea of the move lasts longer than it should and is again really wrongly handled. The biggest strike though comes where the biggest scares should be which is the mystery surrounding the town. This is relegated to the backstory of it's own film as it takes a near eternity for us to even get to scenes that relate to this subplot. The first hour is concerned with the different troubles associated with the reason why the family moved namely from the townspeople and very rarely is there anything that comes up with the ghosts. This means that it's a largely slow and painful experience for the first half and things pick up slightly towards the end but the only thing in the film that generates any sort of excitement is a nice attack on the family and the final chase into the woods. Beyond this though there isn't all that much and it instead feels more like a drama with horror elements than anything. The last major problem with the film is the premise itself. While nice and capable of being entertaining it doesn't really hold up as much as it should. The very idea of a ghost roaming endlessly in search of someone who is dead strikes as absurd since death would be the one event capable of reuniting all concerned. This hasn't occurred to anyone and makes the film have even less credibility than it already does. All in all this was a suitably boring though potentially good ghost story.The Final Verdict While the story and the potential are there the rest of the film really falters from almost every angle. It can be quite entertaining if in the right mood but this has been done elsewhere much much better so only ghostfilm enthusiasts or for those that love these kind of horrordramas.Rated R Violence some Language and children in danger".

This leads to a lot of loose ends that are never satisfactorily tied together. Overacting inconsistent tone and shoddy character development plague this film. There are so many plot points that are introduced as big moments but then never play out to any significance that I left the theater extremely irritated by Lucy Keyes.";

Guy has been hired by Princeton mayor Samantha Porter Brooke Adams to develop a site  build eight alternative energy windmill turbines on it which has split the town down the middle Porter stands to make over a million dollars if the deal  development goes ahead so pushes Guy.

The biggest problem with The Legend of Lucy Keyes is that fact that it's so slow any slower  it would be going backwards with a script that doesn't even mention Lucy Keyes  her disappearance until after the forty minute mark. I have heard of buildup  scene setting but there's buildup  scene setting  just plain tedium where literally nothing happens for ages  The Legend of Lucy Keyes falls squarely into the tedious category as far as I am concerned. The script can't quite decide whether it wants to be a rural drama with the local opposition to the windmills  a subplot about the Mayor getting rich off the development or a proper supernatural mystery with the disappearance of Lucy Keyes that predictably is finally solved. The murder mystery at the end end starts  finishes within 30 seconds  the whole film is so lethargic  slow. The character's are stock ones with urban city folk moving to a rural area the local scaremonger who talks of local legends the odd local who is wary of strangers  the like. The mystery element just doesn't build that well it's all too predictable  slow  at just over 90 minutes it feels like six hours.Forget about any proper horror as there isn't any there's a couple of flashbacks  one shot that might have been a ghost but otherwise the whole film is quite ambiguous as we are never sure what leads Lucy Cooley to find Lucy Keyes body or how the mayor died. The makers just seemed more interested in having Guy  Jeanne talk to people about nothing in particular a lot. The whole film looks alright but there's no real style here or anything that memorable on show.Filmed in 2004 but not released anywhere until 2006 one can understand why actually shot in Princeton in Massachusetts. The acting is alright but nothing special I take it Brooke Adams needed the money.The Legend of Lucy Keyes is a film that I hated it's so slow  predictable with a script that wavers between rural drama  supernatural mystery but doesn't satisfy on either count. For insomniacs only.".

I did wish however that more was answered about the historical treatment of the movie much was left to the imagination for something that was claimed to have a truthful subtext.

Not only because I usually like Yves Montand and Romy Schneider but because above all this is a film about human feelings and reactions.Claude Sautet's works are not intellectual movies but they have the quality of showing people in real life with their strength and their weakness we can find people who laugh and cry. They are films about life there isn't necessarily an happy ending. In Hollywood they're not able to talk to us about REAL persons. Simple isn't it? A director normally shows life you may say. But in reality I don't think it's so easy. The risk is to talk about people with exaggerations and melodramatic elements. In movies like Csar et Rosalie we find common situations people with whom we can identify and share feelings.Here we have a woman who can't choose between two men... Ingmar Bergman has another approach in choosing psychological and darker aspects of people. It's another valid method. I chose to comment this film because it's an example of intimate cinema a way of telling stories which talk to hearts.".

	schema:headline " Independent struggles of Rosalie authoritative acts of Cesar and mesmerizing talent of Claude Sautet";
	schema:reviewBody "After the 25th anniversary of Romy Schneider's death I decided to see this film once again after a number of years. CESAR E ROSALIE is Romy Schneider's third movie she made with her favorite director during her French career the one who unlike some others knew her as a brilliant actress and as a gentle person Claude Sautet. And what were my impressions after the latest view I was enchanted. I liked this film and strangely in spite of the light content it offers it's rather a profound film.From the very beginning there are three aspects that draw one's attention unforgettable performances very down to earth story and unique musical score. Let me analyze these three factors in more details Romy Schneider gives a profound performance of a woman torn between men and her personal freedom her personal independence. She represents a simple woman with whom mostly female audience may identify. Her feelings are changeable but her life heads to be straightforward. She fails many times but isn't it something most of us experience? Romy does a terrific job in the role reaches the ultimate ability to feel the role to the very core. She once again proves how great actress she was how flexible how dynamic how talented! I also liked Yves Montand as Cesar a furious jealous nervous sometimes loving authoritative man. His fury ends with calmness his jealousy with forgiveness his enemies with friends. Mr Montand portrays his character in a dynamic way and truly becomes the second great star of the movie.The entire content is really very simple yet not too simple not to be sophisticated enough. It is a complicated story of life sometimes even confusing one but truly well executed. All is there for a strict purpose humor in the story is to amuse at the most right moment so that it cannot disturb the point consider for instance the moment Cesar shows Rosalie his new shoes drama is to tell us how attached to every single life it is consider emotional insights galore forgiveness to remind us that the world cannot exist without pardoning. As for simple life story mind you a lot of scenes shot in a car  isn't that a symbol of journey a sort of voyage that life is...? The highly unpredictable ending makes a perfect sense only when you analyze the whole story integrally as life built upon joys and sorrows quarrels and reconciliations. So in this aspect of showing simple people Claude Sautet does a great job in this film really innovative and extremely involving.The music surprised me even enthralled me. These were such memorable unique tunes that so much fitted to the entire story to every single scene. The music absolutely reveals the confusion we find in life as well as the explanation that enlightens all previous doubts. Every single piece fits to the scene one particular scene and in another one it wouldn't fit at all. That goes in pairs with a number of memorable words that are said by the characters. I was under the spell of Rosalie when she said to Cesar everything or nothing. Consider also how Cesar explains the purpose of his arrival on the beach one summer day when the sun shone onto heads more intensely.Nice film original one a work that did not only remind me once again how great Romy Schneider was but the movie which made me interested in Claude Sautet. Although I have not seen many of his films I'll look for them now and only thanks to this charming movie CESAR E ROSALIE. Hope it'll be the same with you when you decide to see it and I give you my heartfelt advice do watch it. It's not a 100 minute waste of time.".

Okay it helps if you have a great leading man a beautiful leading lady plus a great writer and a great director but that's still not quite enough and what you really need is something in the water.  JeanLoup Dabadie is still underappreciated as the multitalent he is.  He thinks nothing of adapting Foreign plays into French Bill Gibson's 'Two For The SeeSaw' became 'Deux pour la balancoir' at Dabadie's hand and was a great hit at the Theatre Montparnasse three or four seasons ago turning out screenplays like this one and even writing lyrics he wrote 'Valentin' for Montand's son and in so doing gave Montand a late hit.  Here he contributes a virtually perfect screenplay on our old friend the Eternal Triangle theme. This film is so perfect that you get the feeling that on the first day of shooting the Good Fairy turned up on the set and waved her Magic wand blessing the entire project.  Love Desire Pain Laughter if you don't get enough of those at home pull up a chair slip in the DVDvideo and sup your fill.  You won't regret a moment of it.".

	schema:headline " Flawed perfection";
	schema:reviewBody "A quiet and flawed little early Seventies classic by Sautet about a love triangle. Why quiet despite the violence and threat of destruction emanating from Yves Montand's character Csar the very successful and impulsive scrap metal dealer? Because David his cartoonistillustrator rival Sami Frey is so calm and because Rosalie a tooperfect Romy Schneider is so reserved. And flawed  because the story and the characters ultimately go nowhere. Why classic in quotation marks however? Because of the excellent casting the sure touch and the polished look. This should be seen in conjunction with Sautet's more complex 1974 Vincent Franois Paul... et les autres also featuring Yves Montand in the central male role.As the film begins Csar and Rosalie are living together. David reappears after a stay in America. It turns out David has always loved Rosalie but he let her marry somebody else an artist from whom she's for some time been divorced. When David reappears at a wedding Rosalie quietly goes off and spends time with him. Csar meets David at a caf and politely but very firmly tells him to back off. David ignores this and Csar wrecks his studio. Rosalie takes David to Csar's offices gives him the combination to the safe so he can steal a million francs in compensation for the studio damage  and runs away to live with him and work in a caf in another town. People are able to act with gross impulsivity in this movie  and still remain pals with the victims of their acts. Csar tracks the pair down and plays his trump card he's bought the big seaside house where Rosalie was so happy as a child. She now goes off to live there with HIM. But later Csar goes to David again with a polite proposal. . .In actual screen time the maletomale relationship is more fully represented  and hence develops more  than the rapports between Rosalie and either of the two men. It goes from confrontation to truce to friendship to intense camaraderie. The 'mnage  trois' doesn't work for Rosalie and she goes off by herself. As philosophical voiceovers by Michel Piccoli come and go you expect something desperate and violent to happen. Perhaps Csar will off David or both men will die violently at sea or on the road? But instead in the complete absence of Rosalie Csar and David remain bachelors and become each other's best friends and most constant companions. Maybe they should get married to each other? But the trouble is they aren't gay and this was before gay marriage anyway.Frey is perfectly handsome and charming in the hirsute style of the Seventies Schneider is perfectly elegant and beautiful in the cold style of Yves Saint Laurent Montand is as great a combination of charming and macho and emotional and cool as anybody in the movies has ever been. You understand why the other two both love him. He's a little older but thank God for that. He's tall and slim and he has all his hair and he's got that grin and that twinkle in the eyes and when he brandishes a big cigar it looks dashing and you forget that it stinks. But there's a flaw in the piece which is Rosalie. She has been tremendously admired by viewers and the director himself who spoke of Romy Schneider as representing all women though he was originally going to cast Deneuve. But Schneider really hasn't much to do other than be pleasant and look lovely and move around from scene to scene. In view of the way her part is written the icy Deneuve might have been more convincing  and more haunting. Rosalie expresses herself by running off or by being absent when she's with Csar and can't get David out of her mind. David is appealing in an enigmatic kind of way. Like Rosalie he bends cooperatively at times but holds back a part of himself always. All the passion is Csar's. This is like Jules et Jim with a lovely mannequin where Jeanne Moreau's character was unfortunately all women apparently is not a single real live woman. A positive addition typical of Sautet's 'oeuvre' is that the two men's professional work is a strong element in the story.The writerdirector team is to be congratulated on not opting for a violent resolution. But they have found no resolution and their surprise finale is only a repetition. Despite the charisma of the three principals a movie that repeats and goes nowhere no matter how appealing can't be called a masterpiece. Csar et Rosalie is an idea that is toyed with as a kitten toys with a ball of wool and then abandoned left in a harmless tangle. If these people weren't so attractive they'd seem aimless and desperate.".

She has been tremendously admired by viewers and the director himself who spoke of Romy Schneider as representing all women though he was originally going to cast Deneuve. But Schneider really hasn't much to do other than be pleasant and look lovely and move around from scene to scene. In view of the way her part is written the icy Deneuve might have been more convincing  and more haunting. Rosalie expresses herself by running off or by being absent when she's with Csar and can't get David out of her mind. David is appealing in an enigmatic kind of way. Like Rosalie he bends cooperatively at times but holds back a part of himself always. All the passion is Csar's. This is like Jules et Jim with a lovely mannequin where Jeanne Moreau's character was unfortunately all women apparently is not a single real live woman. A positive addition typical of Sautet's 'oeuvre' is that the two men's professional work is a strong element in the story.The writerdirector team is to be congratulated on not opting for a violent resolution. But they have found no resolution and their surprise finale is only a repetition. Despite the charisma of the three principals a movie that repeats and goes nowhere no matter how appealing can't be called a masterpiece. Csar et Rosalie is an idea that is toyed with as a kitten toys with a ball of wool and then abandoned left in a harmless tangle. If these people weren't so attractive they'd seem aimless and desperate.";

It was like many of her moves were based on a whim and that made it hard to care about her or see what David or Cesar saw in her other than her great looks.

That my friends is the premise for the unlikely meeting between Yves Montand and Romy Schneider who meet on and off throughout one single night then separate. In his wisdom CostaGavros has taken one of the most beautiful women in the world and asked her to play dowdy and a man who is charm personified and asked him to play nerd. Somehow it works. Of COURSE it does. We're talking Montand and Schneider here so what's not to work. On the other hand the odds against the stranger whose shopping he knocks to the ground whilst alighting from a taxi being a woman as angstridden as himself have to be in the high ImpossiblesToOne and it might be interesting to see if Romain Gary made a better fist of it in his novel from which the film is adapted. Montand and Gavros had a history of course Gavros got his first break as a director when both Montand and his wife Simone Signoret agreed to star in Compartiment tuers which may not have been greenlighted otherwise and Montand turned in one of his alltime best performances and that's saying something in L'Aveu with Gavros on bullhorn so maybe he figured why not. It is indisputable that Montand and Schneider were far far better in Sautet's Cesar et Rosalie where she was allowed to be not just an actress and she was a very fine one but a BEAUTIFUL actress and he was allowed to display not just his considerable acting prowess but also his singular charm and charisma. Here as if the two guiltladen protagonists weren't enough we get an eccentric animal trainer a dog dancing with a monkey symbolic? You tell me and Montand 'communicating' with Schneider's brainimpaired husband via gibberish. Yeah THAT's what it is a Doris Day movie.

Bogart  a last minute replacement for Cary Grant had just completed The Caine Mutiny. Hepburn had just won the Oscar for Roman Holiday and Wilder had Stalag 17 and Sunset Boulevard completed and would have a string of hits that started with Sabrina and continue on until One Two Three in 1961.All of the stars were properly aligned for Sabrina. Although I think Grant might have been better in the part Bogart worked hard to be semitough and likable. I'll be honest and say I found it disturbing to see him try to win over Hepburn. His features were too worn and hard to be completely winning. He and Holden worked well together which is amazing when you consider they couldn't stand each other off screen.Hepburn of course is gorgeous. She's the perfect combination of charming elegant tomboyishness and beauty.Wilder does it again with his screenplay and directing. First he assembles an excellent supporting cast especially Walter Hampden and John Williams. Then he keeps the comedy coming and seldom lets up for us to catch our breath. His use of the camera is terrific too. I love the shot of Bogart at his desk in the distance while the camera shoots through several doorways.Top notch production first rate cast and wonderful screenplay and directing add up to a classic every movie lover should own.9 out of 10".

	schema:headline " Bogie's Society Film";
	schema:reviewBody "Tennis anyone? That trite statement actually comes from a play. It was spoken by a young struggling actor of some rugged handsome looks sometime in the 1920s. He said it with a now  famous trademark lisp. Yes Humphrey Bogart said that line. You see when he started out in Broadway productions he was a juvenile actor. He played young social butterfly types hard to believe isn't it?. But there was a rational reason to think this among the producers on Broadway  young man Bogart came from a prominent upper middle class family in Manhattan. His father was Dr. Bogart a physician to wealthy people. His mother was an magazine artist. So yes...one could easily see that young Mr. Bogart would be used to saying things like Tennis anyone now and then...and so could play the young friend of the hero or the caddish social butterfly false lover or...well you can picture it! It is with great respect to Humphrey Bogart's determination to be a real actor...to play real people...that he broke out of this culdesac of juveniles and ended up in the roles he is loved for Rick Blaine Sam Spade Charlie Allnut Fred C. Dobbs Philip Marlowe Captain Phillip Francis Queeg Duke Mantee Baby Face Martin...characters we know are real for better or worse. Not light hearted society types we will never meet in a million years.Yet Bogie did return to this arena once in his later career  after his only Oscar. In 1954 he played Linus Larribee older of a pair of brothers his younger brother is William Holden as David Larribee who are the heirs to an industrial and shipping empire headed by their father Oliver Larribee Walter Hampden. Into their upper class lives descends Sabrina Audrey Hepburn the daughter of the family chauffeur Fairchild John Williams. She has long had a crush on David a real playboy and once even tried to commit suicide to be saved by Linus without his realizing it was a planned suicide. She goes to Paris to study cooking and returns after two years a sophisticated attractive woman. And she turns the world of the Larribees upside down.There is a merger in the works between Larribee Industries and the largest sugar cane plantation owner in Puerto Rico Francis X. Bushman whose daughter Martha Hyer has always liked David. David is not crazy about this and when he is reintroduced to the new Sabrina he is knocked off his feet. This jeopardizes the entire business plan which involves using the sugar to manufacture a new type of allpurpose plastic that the Larribees have the patent rights to. Linus who is the ant to David's grasshopper is determined to undue the effect of Sabrina on his brother and if necessary romance her himself. He does...only to find that she is quite intoxicating and that he is falling in love with her.It has been suggested that Bogart was wrong in this film like Gary Cooper was in Billy Wilder's other Hepburn comedy LOVE IN THE AFTERNOON because he was too old and his image didn't fit. Well it is true that we have another May  September relationship here and that Bogart's personae after his string of memorable performances was not as a financial type. Cary Grant the original choice for the role might have seemed better. But Grant is as much a misfire here as Bogart appears to be. The problem is Holden. One can see Bogart as a hard working type and Holden's older brother quite easily but Grant with his English accentwould have made Holden seem outofplace.

Walter Hampden was one of Broadway's leading stars especially in Shakespearean roles between the teens and the 1930s. His production of HAMLET was considered one of the best ever on the American stage. But he arrived late in Hollywood and although an impressive character actor rarely got any impressive role. His performance as Oliver Larribee the last vestige of robber baron elitism in American society is wonderful.

He and Bogart share some nice give and take scenes courtesy of Wilder's directing here  just in time for Hampden who died a year after this film was produced.".

	onyx:emotionText "Tennis anyone? That trite statement actually comes from a play. It was spoken by a young struggling actor of some rugged handsome looks sometime in the 1920s. He said it with a now  famous trademark lisp. Yes Humphrey Bogart said that line. You see when he started out in Broadway productions he was a juvenile actor. He played young social butterfly types hard to believe isn't it?. But there was a rational reason to think this among the producers on Broadway  young man Bogart came from a prominent upper middle class family in Manhattan. His father was Dr. Bogart a physician to wealthy people. His mother was an magazine artist. So yes...one could easily see that young Mr. Bogart would be used to saying things like Tennis anyone now and then...and so could play the young friend of the hero or the caddish social butterfly false lover or...well you can picture it! It is with great respect to Humphrey Bogart's determination to be a real actor...to play real people...that he broke out of this culdesac of juveniles and ended up in the roles he is loved for Rick Blaine Sam Spade Charlie Allnut Fred C. Dobbs Philip Marlowe Captain Phillip Francis Queeg Duke Mantee Baby Face Martin...characters we know are real for better or worse. Not light hearted society types we will never meet in a million years.Yet Bogie did return to this arena once in his later career  after his only Oscar. In 1954 he played Linus Larribee older of a pair of brothers his younger brother is William Holden as David Larribee who are the heirs to an industrial and shipping empire headed by their father Oliver Larribee Walter Hampden. Into their upper class lives descends Sabrina Audrey Hepburn the daughter of the family chauffeur Fairchild John Williams. She has long had a crush on David a real playboy and once even tried to commit suicide to be saved by Linus without his realizing it was a planned suicide. She goes to Paris to study cooking and returns after two years a sophisticated attractive woman. And she turns the world of the Larribees upside down.There is a merger in the works between Larribee Industries and the largest sugar cane plantation owner in Puerto Rico Francis X. Bushman whose daughter Martha Hyer has always liked David. David is not crazy about this and when he is reintroduced to the new Sabrina he is knocked off his feet. This jeopardizes the entire business plan which involves using the sugar to manufacture a new type of allpurpose plastic that the Larribees have the patent rights to. Linus who is the ant to David's grasshopper is determined to undue the effect of Sabrina on his brother and if necessary romance her himself. He does...only to find that she is quite intoxicating and that he is falling in love with her.It has been suggested that Bogart was wrong in this film like Gary Cooper was in Billy Wilder's other Hepburn comedy LOVE IN THE AFTERNOON because he was too old and his image didn't fit. Well it is true that we have another May  September relationship here and that Bogart's personae after his string of memorable performances was not as a financial type. Cary Grant the original choice for the role might have seemed better. But Grant is as much a misfire here as Bogart appears to be. The problem is Holden. One can see Bogart as a hard working type and Holden's older brother quite easily but Grant with his English accentwould have made Holden seem outofplace. They would have had to change the Larribees into a transplanted English family in America to make Grant fit in perfectly. That might have worked  but it would have strained belief.Bogart rarely played comic roles after 1940 but in his late 1950s films he did do comedy a bit more here in BEAT THE DEVIL and in WE'RE NO ANGEL.

The film is moving thanks mostly to Linus's restrained courting and Sabrina's relationship with her father and there are wonderful comic moments thanks to Holden's perfectly timed wise quips and lighthearted nature which clash with the senior Larabee's pragmatism.

Audrey Hepburn as usual is luminous and she is as usual paired off with a suitor far too old for her. But part of the problem is what the story does with her character. She pines away for Holden and then goes away to cooking school in Paris. Why does she go? Did she want to go? Unknown. While away she writes her father a letter saying she is over Holden. But then when she returns she in a rather absurd coincidence runs into him at the train station. The two connect. So she wasn't over him after all? Or was she over him but then fell back in love when she saw him? What was her plan if she hadn't coincidentally run into him? Who knows? Later Bogart and Holden sort out which of them gets to have her which is rather sexist and also robs her of her agency. Surely a charming girl like that must have other options besides a buffoon and an old man. Holden hasn't been given much of a character to play. He's all charm and nothing else. The script never rounds him out with grace notes that might have helped us to understand why he lives such a vacuous life. As an actor Holden has consistently shown an ability to locate the darkness buried inside his characters but he never seems to tap into that quality here. It might have been interesting if Hepburn during the course of dating Holden finally realized what a shallow loser he is and dumped him. And then maybe Holden in turn is forced to reexamine his life. But the story never explores that darker more interesting possibility. Instead Hepburn is a pawn in the men's games. As for Bogart he was of course one of our great stars and did amazing work in dramas and crime stories. But in a light romantic comedy like this he's very much out of his element like Holden is. Bogart took the role after Cary Grant turned it down. Bogart manages to capture the cold sourness of his character just fine but he never locates the man's gradual transformation into a guy in love. He never seems interested in Hepburn at all which is oddly something of an accomplishment given how beautiful Hepburn is. The problem is further exacerbated by the fact that Bogart is too old unattractive and emotionally cold for Hepburn to ever give him the time of day. When these two wouldbe lovers are reunited at the very end of the film they hug rather than kiss. It's as if the filmmakers are acknowledging the absurdity of that these two might actually be right for each other. Or perhaps they know that there's something rather gross about the fiftyish Bogart kissing the twentyish Hepburn.".

	schema:reviewBody "On the surface 'Sabrina' may not look like a comedy but that's because the humour is very subtle. There's a party scene where everyone is enjoying themselves Sabrina and David are having a romantic moment while Linus is in the next room testing the unbreakable plastic. Sabrina's suicide attempt in the garage was hilarious.Coming back to the film 'Sabrina' is a classic romance. The chemistry between Hepburn and Bogart is very sweet. While it may look like a film about Sabrina's journey to be with her love it turns out to be someone else's journey. There are some lovely moments between Bogart and Hepburn. The background score adds to the romance. On the surface Hepburn and Bogart may seem like an odd couple but as we see how Billy Wilder brings them on screen the oddness vanishes. Both the actors are superb. Bogart downplays his part while Hepburn is charmingly vivacious. Holden does well.My only complaint is the DavidAlice angle. In the end why does David decide to go through with marrying Alice since he clearly does not love her? Was that just to create a happy ending? There are some nice location shots of France and America. We don't see much of France but the little we see seems a little too romanticized. The cinematography is good.Billy Wilder's 'Sabrina' is a classic and for me it has stood the test of time. I have seen both remakes earlier and they certainly let down. A great movie for classic romance lovers!".

The characters are portrayed so convincingly I never had the impression they were acting. It was really a charming movie. Even Linus as played by Bogart had some really humorous lines all deadpanned as if he were a bit serious when speaking them. The movie flows seamlessly from one scene to the next and never left me craving better dialogue. Modern day movies just don't seem to have the grace of films like this one. It was a treat to be reminded of how people viewed life in that era. A Cinderella story it is indeed but it is so much more than that.".

	schema:headline " Awful";
	schema:reviewBody "What a shocking disappointment. After expecting something that would live up to Hepburn classics such as Roman Holiday this movie was a wet cold slap in the face. The plot is outlandish and obvious the humor is absurdly broad and Humphrey Bogart as Linus Larabee looks old and unhappy as if he is appearing in the film at the point of a gun. William Holden as David Larabee is far too old for his role and he plays the playboy as such a transparent cad that it is hard to generate the slightest sympathy for him. What a free spirit such as Sabrina would see in either man is far from obvious. The development of the supporting characters is bafflingly erratic particularly Walter Hampden as the Larabee patriarch. Oliver Larabee begins the film as a flinty business man and transforms without the slightest explanation into a comic lush by the end. The film is clearly an effort to create an American comedy of manners and class but the translation into an American setting is a nearly complete failure. I cannot tell how it appeared to audiences at the time but 50 years on it appears sloppy and dated. It is painful to consider how much more compelling it might have been had Cary Grant taken the role of Linus.".

Virtually all the books about Wilder  and possibly Hepburn and Bogie as well  mention the tension on the set between lone wolf Bogie and cosy threesome Wilder Holden and Hepburn and the amazing thing is that this doesn't show on screen. Wilder makes a big thing out of the fact that the 'Baron'  an outstanding cameo by Marcel Dalio  is making souffles at Hepburns Cooking School in Paris as if to reinforce what he Wilder himself is doing from beginning to end in this delightful confection. Everyone was on top of their game and boy does it show. This is one of those films that no one should even DREAM of remaking because that's like trying to reconstitute as an adult a snowflake that enchanted you as a child. Untouchable unmissable.

	schema:reviewBody "Audrey Hepburn Billy Wilder Hubert de Givenchy Humphrey Bogart William Holden Charles Lang. With names like that attached to a project do you even need a movie? Fortunately we got one. A great one! Sabrina is a charming and moonlit romantic comedy from two masters of the genre. Billy Wilder and Audrey Hepburn. It's essentially a retelling of the classic Cinderella story. The girl who is poor but falls in love with a prince and is made over beautifully to get his attention. There's no wicked stepsisters in Sabrina and nomagical faerie Godmother but who cares. Hepburn is Sabrina the daughter of a chauffeur to a rich family named the Larrabee's. The Larrabee patriarch has two sons played by Bogart and Holden. Bogart is the older and more business savvy brother. He is realistic and practical and regards the family's name and fortune with the utmost care and regard. This is contrary to Holden who is more of a careless playboy seeking fun and women in life. He's been married three times always falling in love or at least confusing lust with love. Hepburn at the start of the film is desperately in love with Holden and watches him at a ball from up in the tree under the moonlight. To help her get over her crush she is sent to refining school in Paris where see learns how to cook speak and dress. Basically she becomes a lady. What emerges is a swan from the ugly duckling and for the first time Holden sees her and falls in love. However time has passed and Sabrina doesn't exactly feel the same way anymore. Plus Bogart expresses his own interest in the elfin' and glamorous chauffeur's daughter. Watching all this play out in such a romantic and funny way is pure cinema. All the elements come together in this film. Hepburn looks magnificent in Hubert de Givenchy's gowns and dresses. The scenes on the racquetball court are whimsical and absolutely priceless. Frederick Hollander's musical score is breathtaking and haunting sending the audience far away from their problems and allowing them to become completely involved in the characters and story. Really to tell the truth there isn't much plot but the story is good because it's so simple. Sabrina isn't a complicated movie at all nor is it very in depth in exploring what true love is. But at the heart it's a faerie tale. It doesn't need to be realistic or profound. If you're looking for answers about the true nature of love and selfsacrifice then you won't find any in Sabrina. However if you're looking to be swept off your feet and taken to a far away place where naive blind and moonstruck romantic love are the rule then this is the movie for you.".

She is a reluctant participant in extreme duress applied to the detainees but believes that the truth may only be obtained through such tactics. For several years she is singleminded in her pursuit of leads to uncover the whereabouts of Al Qaeda's leader Osama Bin Laden. Finally in 2011 it appears that her work will pay off and a U.S. Navy SEAL team is sent to kill or capture Bin Laden. But only Maya is confident Bin Laden is where she says he is.";

It takes her almost 10 years a little waterboarding a couple of dead colleagues and a lot of arguing with her superiors but she manages to follow the lead all the way to the now famous raid in Abbottabad.It's a very captivating film even with its 160 minutes runtime and the big raid at the end is quite intense and realistic. That said Bigelow's previous 'The Hurt Locker' was even better. But it's close!As for the controversy whether the film is 'protorture propaganda' or not it shows what likely happened. A very unpleasant sight for Americans sure but that's no reason to leave it out. Whether or not 'OBL' would've been caught without the use of torture is speculation that has no place in this movie it's a depiction of events not a moral study.Some Americans might still find it hard to watch a movie that requires you to form your own opinion about the actions of your countrygovernmentarmy instead of getting one spoon fed by those very same institutions. But given the America's options in government potential it seems a luxury Americans no longer have.".

	schema:headline " Technically Impressive but Surprisingly Hollow";
	schema:reviewBody "Zero Dark Thirty is a grim clinical depiction of the CIA search for Osama bin Laden. Its strongest feature is its dramatization of the Navy Seal Team 6 operation in Abbottabad Pakistan that killed bin Laden. That sequence is so professionally shot it could be actual documentary footage. Zero has no real plot. Episodic scenes occur in a choppy manner one after the other. Scenes consist of depictions of beating and water boarding of detainees in order to gather information agents stalking a suspect in Pakistan's crowded chaotic bazaars terrorist bombings assassinations and assassination attempts. There are also scenes in offices where characters stare intently at computer screens or interrogation videos and characters yell at each other and use obscenities as their frustrating hunt for Osama bin Laden wears them down. Zero makes no attempt to draw the viewer in with any human sentiment. Characters are given no backstory and no character arch. CIA agent Maya played by Jessica Chastain is the closest the film has to a main character. She reveals no affect. Her face is blank. She isn't so much robotic as inert. We know nothing about her except that she was recruited to the CIA while in high school  we are never told what would draw the CIA to a high school student. I didn't care about this character at all. All I kept thinking was Jessica Chastain is being praised for this performance? Why? The dullness of her performance and the underwritten character made it almost impossible for me to lose myself in the story such as it was. Jason Clarke is very strong and charismatic as Dan a CIA interrogator. Dan humiliates beats and water boards suspects and then feeds them delicious meals of hummus and olives when they deliver. His depiction of his work as just another job  he could be playing a bus driver with the same amount and degree of expressiveness  is provocative. I wish I had gone to see a film built around his character and his performance. Overall I was disappointed in the film. Feature films are an art form. I want them to do to me what drama can do. I want to be made to identify with a character and I want through that identification to learn more about life or I want to be entertained. Zero did neither for me. I wasn't entertained and my understanding and worldview were not expanded. I think the same material could have been better treated in a documentary with selective reenactments. Zero Dark Thirty sidesteps key questions. Maya sacrificed years of her life to the hunt for Osama bin Laden. Dan risks his humanity by making his living beating and humiliating other men. Men women and children throughout the Muslim world and as the film makes clear in America's and Europe's cities are eager to blow themselves up as long as they can take some infidels with them. Why? The film doesn't even acknowledge that there are people out there asking the question never mind attempting to suggest an answer. The film opens with audio from the September 11 2001 terror attacks suggesting that the war between Islam and the nonMuslim world dates from that attack. Not so. Islam increased its territory through jihad from its invention in the seventh century until September 11 1683 at the Battle of Vienna. After that defeat Islam stopped its spread. The significance of the date of September 11 goes back over four centuries. America's founding fathers had to deal with jihad see Thomas Jefferson and the Barbary Pirates. Some argue terrorism including the 911 attack is caused by Western imperialism. The solution to these thinkers is for the Western world to be nicer to nonWestern nations to practice multiculturalism and to share the wealth. Others argue that jihad is inextricable from Islam and that one necessary step is for the West to recognize and cherish its own unique virtues  to cherish that for which its spies soldiers and citizens fight sacrifice kill and die. Zero Dark Thirty never so much as brushes up against these questions. At its key moment the film is hollow. We all know how the hunt ends  we all know Osama bin Laden is dead. Zero might have addressed why Maya gave the time of her life to that hunt why Dan risked his humanity why Seal Team 6 trained for years and risked their lives. Zero never does consider why these who might have been the film's heroes did what they did and I walked out of the theater oddly unmoved by all the high tension and graphic violence I'd just sat through.".

	schema:reviewBody "After watching Zero Dark Thirty I am simply amazed at the critical reception it's received. In fact it's one of the most bizarre and puzzling critical reactions I've seen since more than 60 of critics liked Spiderman III on rottentomatoes To me this is simply not a good film. In fact I wouldn't even be as kind to call it merely OK or middling. I believe it's flat out bad.Zero Dark Thirty is the type of film that needs exceptional editing and writing to work. This is because it's about a long drawn out process mainly done by people sitting at desks. The film I imagined if as good as its reviews would have cracking dialog sharp plotting quick editing The problem with the film is that it's writing and editing is quite poor. The dialogs in this film simply do not work and undermine talented actorsactresses. The characters talked to each other at a TV movie level of depth and linguistic expression. Many scenes including some like the infamous F bomb laden ones simply do not feel believable as happening in a professional CIA setting. Many of the arguments feel stagey and we need you to act emotional here outbursty as mentioned like they'd do in a TV movie. I suspect the screenwriter wanted to make the people feel real and down to earth except it does just the opposite. The dialog makes the characters feel contrived as if trying too hard to feel real.SPOILER  The other problem with the script is that while I do not know the details of what really happened vs what Bigelow and co. fictionalized many parts of the manhunt felt ridiculous. eg. There is a scene where a terrorist spills all his guts information wise just because Chastain tricked him into thinking he told him all of that the night before and had memory loss. Would he really just give up and say everything like that? There's an entirely predictable explosiondeath scene prompted by a smiley CIA agent going oh just let him into the base we don't want to spook him by scaring him which was ridiculously naive by a trained professional. The CIA are shown a video of a detainee saying X character is dead I buried him btw here's a picture and they all just believe it as fact without questioning whether he'd be lieing. The entire plot hinges on catching a courier who they seem to find because of a long lost picture and some other details I didn't really catch  either way the way they caught him was very confusing and not drawn out well plotting wise. The manhunt did not come off as very complex intelligent or plotted well to me. It felt like the characters just sat around for a decade and waited for clues to fall in their lap!Then there's the editing. This is a long sloppily put together film. Many of the scenes feel unnecessary. There are long forgetting scenes of people talking. For a large portion of the film I could hardly stand to watch the dull back and forths while keeping my eyes open.Many people have pointed out the lack of character development. This is true but I also blame the dialog most of all. Chastain is a blank terrorist catching robot and simply does not feel like a real person to me. None of them do really. This makes it harder to cheer for them. They come off as terrorist catching line delivery devices not real people with emotions.Zero Dark Thirty came off to me as a misfire on almost every level. It's poorly written edited it fails to make its characters or plot interesting. Zero Dark Thirty tries so hard to be realistic and naturalistic that it forgets it's a film. But not only does it go in that docudrama wannabe direction but it does a very poor job of feeling realistic due to its stagey characters and dialog and clearly contrived plotting and setups. It neither has its cake or eats it.This is simply a colossal misfire after the near masterpiece that is the Hurt Locker for Bigelow. I am truly shocked at how poor a film this is on every level after the critical reception to it. One of the very worst films I've seen all year".

	schema:headline " A Perfect Depiction of the UBL Saga";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm not claiming that this movie is 100 factual or even close to it but I think the filmmaker did a brilliant job of chronicling the UBL saga. IMO the theme of the movie in a nutshell is this We got this guy maybe? but at what cost and were we justified? These are not easy questions to answer and they are left open ended for the most part.The three main criticisms I've come across in the reviews is that 1 The movie is propaganda 2 It glorifies torture and 3 It is factually inaccurate. The third is probably a legitimate criticism but the movie really makes no pretenses about being a documentary and there is a prominent disclaimer at the beginning that it is based primarily on eyewitness accounts and it is common knowledge that those can be unreliable. Regarding the death of UBL  well the movie even leaves that open ended which is pretty consistent with the actual reported events. We only get brief blurred glimpses of the side of his face and the only definitive identification comes from the 'expert' protagonist who is clearly somewhat derailed and obsessed with the manhunt and who also stated UBL was at that location with 100 certainty.That leads in to the first criticism. I fail to understand how this movie can be perceived as propaganda. How does portraying a 10 year ordeal culminating in an unglamorous methodical execution style raid in which a helicopter crashes and SEALS kill possibly innocent bystanders with machine like precision where the target's identity is not a even a certainty even remotely constitute a biased pro American agenda? Not to mention that the whole raid is brought about by a hunch and a fluke stroke of luck and not any actual key pieces of information obtained through interrogation other than a name. If anything luck was the deciding factor in taking down UBL  not American awesomeness.Now the torture  How does showing torture equate to glorifying torture? Does Braveheart glorify torture too? Again  this had the opposite effect on me. The viewer is forced to confront the unpleasant reality that we tortured many detainees probably pointlessly in our desperation to capture UBL and bring him to justice. What was the primary motivation? Revenge? Safety? Do the ends justify the means? Essentially that's the exact question the filmmaker is posing to the viewer by exposing the torture to public scrutiny.Perhaps this movie just rubs people the wrong way because they find it too sympathetic to government officials. It's easy to criticize to the Government and trust me I am far from an optimist when it comes to American politicians so I do it often. Obviously our leaders were faced with some difficult decisions after 911. Did we handle things the best way? Certainly not but for better or worse this thing played out the way it did and we have to deal with it and move forward.".

	schema:headline " Poor writing. Requires too much suspension of disbelief to pretend it is real...and slow";
	schema:reviewBody "If this movie had been entirely fictional I would have given it 2 stars. The importance of the story and the care taken in some parts gave it 5.Before I excoriate here are the good points. It tells a very important story. Our country was spending soldiers' blood and sanity and HUGE amounts of money. Getting UBL made it easier to stop. Even if he had become less relevant to AlQaeda as the Pakistan station chief said in the movie he still was important to many voters.The movie used real names and stories of persons of interest to the analysts.The movie shows how nasty the relatively low key torture techniques that were used in the US's name are. I have no idea how realistic they were but certainly it was not fun to watch. Hopefully it gives the viewer some sense of what they are approving or disapproving when they express their views to their elected representatives.The raid was depicted realistically though I am no expert. It was quiet the soldiers weren't jumping around yelling Hooyah during the operation. The children and women in the house were upset and terrified and pitiable. Things went wrong and the soldiers needed workarounds. The writing did not put the analyst physically present at the raid just to add drama  I have no doubt that was discussed and rejected. The only complaint I have is the man who killed UBL went into a shell shocked daze afterward. I suspect after all that training those men are VERY professional and would be working quickly and with focus to get the job done and get out.Now the criticism A few more subtitles and back story explanations of names when they were used would make easier for westerners to follow the interesting paths of reasoning the analysts were following. Would have kept the brain engaged a bit more. The movie ends up being rather slow...seriously. A few people in my row were nodding and one woman two seats down was sleeping through almost the entire movie. Maybe she had a rough night. . .  Would have been nice to see some more character development. Except for a few pairings you could hardly tell from one scene to the next how two people would interact. One scene professional one scene companionable the next screaming and the next compassion with no explanation of the shifts. Huh? Maybe a little more time with the character's back stories or seeing them interact in different ways would have smoothed this out. When a movie pretends to be documenting real events even if embellished for dramatic effect it makes operation of suspension of disbelief more difficult for me. The depicted behavior of the civilian intelligence analysts was often amazingly unprofessional ignorant of very basic security practices and inconsistent and that pulled me out of the story.Examples Maya is meeting a colleague for dinner at a Marriott. She floats the name of the person they are hunting for across a table in an insecure environment where anyone could hear! I hope real analysts operate with a bit more discretion when they are away from the ID badges and pass code protected doors and computer systems.Later in the movie after the bombing at the Marriott Maya is invited out to eat and says I don't eat out...too dangerous. Later she is seen half intoxicated at a bar when a colleague delivers a rather important piece of intelligence equipment to her which we never see ir hear about again.A senior CIA officer screams at his team during a meeting. Nothing more constructive was communicated than Please get me some answers except with no please and lots of histrionics. Not exactly effective leadership. Really? With all the stress in the lives of folks in the field already it is hard to imagine any high level worker lasting very long in that position with that sort of behavior. The team would self destruct around him.Maya shrieks at her boss in a hallway in a way that would make anyone question her stability. Very unprofessional. Unstable people don't work in classified environments very long.Maya in a high level meeting with the CIA director blurts out irrelevanttothediscussiondata just to get some attention. Paraphrase the house is 4021 feet away eight tenths of miles not one mile This is 10 years into her character's career! A I have nothing important to say but pay attention to me meeting strategy is discarded rather quickly after a little experience in the real world. . .or folks who use it find themselves in quiet positions pretty quickly where they won't distract from the core discussions and waste people's time. Surely the writer could have had her say something that was actually important to the discussion that no one else could have known? Multiple classified conversations between CIA folks on cell phones ?? What are they even doing with cell phones in a secure area?I was a tad disturbed that real suicide attack stories where real people died were doctored up to make them apply more directly to the characters in the movie. I am thinking in particular about the Chapman attack. A 45 year old mother of three was killed for real but she wasn't an analyst out of Pakistan at the time and her name was not Jessica.Check out the wiki article on the Camp Chapman attack in 2009 and read the section on contractor and CIA casualties.I have to give the writer that leeway to turn a complete snoozer into something with a little excitement but this seemed disrespectful.In short too unrealistic to feel like a true to life story and too slow to enjoy like a piece of fiction.".

Maybe if there was at least 15 of the facts accurate and Im talking about facts that are just known about this manhunt. Maybe if there was a team of transformers or comic cartoon heroes supporting this action. Maybe if somewhere in Pakistan Charlie Chaplin fell into sewer because of some banana . Then maybe it would have 2 stars from me.";

Now the movie is all about her. She knows the place of Bin Laden. But the CIA turns into an incompetent organization where bureaucrats want proof and therefore decide to do nothing. Thanks to her intrusive attitude she pushes the CIA into action. She yells at her boss. She takes a pen and writes angry notes on the office glass separation of a higher CIA boss every day. She curses in the conference room to another even much higher CIA boss etc. And only because of all this behavior the CIA decides to raid that place.Now some special forces raid Bin Laden's place and kill him.

The hurt locker was more of a pure war movie whereas Zero Dark Thirty uses more dramatizations and has a more coherent direction while still being an incredibly suspenseful movie.Some people might criticize this movie for a lack of character development but they are really missing the point of this movie. It's not your typical Hollywood movie that introduces a protagonist and develops himher until the conflict is resolved. This movie is about tracking and killing Osama Bin Laden and the way they used the main character as a metaphor for America as a whole was really impressive even while refraining from your typical often boring character developing scenes.Much more than your average action movie Zero Dark Thirty was a combination of badass scenes phenomenal editing and music and a fantastic mostly true story with epic scope that I can't wait to see again. This is the BEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR and this is coming from a huge batman fan who also just saw Django Unchained a week ago.".

But what was striking is how completely devoid it was of character. Courtroom dramas trade in the same stock but even the most pedestrian episode of Boston Legal or LA Law contain more compelling characters than anyone in this movie.And most movies about real events overcome the inherent story problems by provoking thought in the audience about the events themselves. What they lack in dramatic momentum they make up for in unsettling questions. But it was amazing how completely empty this film was of anything resembling a question about what was going on. It was as if Kathryn Bigelow thought she was just presenting reality to the audience.

	schema:reviewBody "Greetings again from the darkness. Kathryn Bigelow entered the realm of elite directors when her war thriller The Hurt Locker exploded onto the Oscar scene a few years ago. Once again she proves why the critics adore her and the movie going masses stay away. She is an expert filmmaker a brilliant technician though not much into the whole entertainment scene.We always try to label films and this one doesn't quite fit as thriller or action or even war genre. It's really a tense procedural drama focusing on the behindthescenes CIA hunt for Osama bin Laden. In fact it's mostly the story of one obsessed CIA agent's research and unwavering pursuit of the one most responsible for the tragic events of 91101 as well as many others.The film started out as a story of the nearly decade long pursuit and the failure to find him. Everything including the movie changed on May 2 2011 when Navy SEAL Team Six pulled off the daring and historic mission to kill bin Laden. The book No Easy Day by Mark Owen pseudonym for real life SEAL Matt Bissonnette was released and many of the details became public. Bigelow and her writer Mark Boal former journalist went even deeper into research mode and now the film has instigated Congressional hearings in regards to some of the scenes.Bigelow presents this as old school hard core males vs the intellectual instinctive and brazen Maya played by Jessica Chastain. In the book she is referred to as Jen but her name matters not. What's important is her laserlike focus for almost 10 years despite the numerous attempts by her superiors to ignore her theories.Much of the film deals with the group meetings and presentations to CIA midmanagers who either don't trust her or refuse to put their own careers on the line. Maya remains relentless. She finally gets a audience with CIA Director Leon Panetta played by James Gandolfini and introduces herself as the MFR who found this place sir. This comes across as confident not disrespectful.Bigelow and Boal refuse the temptation of providing any real backstory or personal life on these characters. We do learn that Maya was recruited right out of high school so we can assume she wasn't a typical 18 year old. The only thought of a romantic interlude is quickly shot down by Maya proclaiming in so many words she's not that kind of girl.Most of the men in the film are presented as near Neanderthals. Jason Clarke is the old school field agent who has mastered the use of torture waterboarding and humiliation to gain information from detainees. The 60 Minutes clip of Obama saying that America will no longer utilize torture is one of the few tips to national politics that the film offers up. The only politics are those played by station chief Kyle Chandler who is protective of his job and Mark Strong who seems relatively helpless without the support of his superiors. All this while Maya keeps pushing and pounding for action.The Langley vs Field work provides a distinctive line in the sand between the two worlds and emphasizes just how easy it is to make a mistake in judgment. What if we had been wrong on the location of bin Laden? What if the fortress had belonged to a drug dealer instead and the SEAL team had invaded a private home within the boundaries of supposed ally Pakistan? Jessica Chastain is believable and tough in her role and Jason Clarke dominates the screen in his early scenes. Other fine support work comes courtesy of Edgar Ramirez Mark Duplass Harold Perrineau and Jennifer Ehle. When we finally get to the strategy session for the mission we meet SEAL's played by Chris Pratt and Joel Edgerton. The 25 minutes or so dedicated to the helicopter mission are filmed as if we are wearing the same nightvision goggles worn by the brave souls storming the castle. It's a very impressive sequence.If you enjoy the details of a procedural drama then you will find much to like here ... knowing the ultimate outcome doesn't affect the suspense one bit. However if you seek an entertaining respite from your daily grind this one will offer no assistance ... despite another excellent and minimalistic mood score from Alexadre Desplat.".

Behind different faces the same obsessive character. The obsession portrayed in her films actually is quite simplistic and straightforward but anyhow in our time her oeuvres are considered as deep realistic and arty. After an adrenaline fix come the inevitable frustration and emptiness of living Mrs. Bigelow shows it to us over and over again her hero has a conniving streak in himher but a hero nevertheless. She's so focused on her obsessed character it's easy for her to claim that the Iraq war film she made was apolitical and ZDT a political thriller has no political agenda. Mr. Boal is a journalist. When he begins to write stories for the big screen we praise his journalistic approach and we can easily forget that as most journalists these days in the US Mr. Boal is an embedded journalist. Unlike the Hurt Locker which by opening with a quote from Chris Hedges gives a false impression of an antiwar movie ZDT is at least honest. At the very beginning it gives us a warningBased on firsthand accounts of actual eventsAka what CIA told us and what CIA wants you to see.The decadelong war on terror seen through a CIA agent's eyes the whole film is shaped into a CIA narrative. As Mrs. Bigelow wrote in her LA Times article defining ZDT's raison d'tre we should never discount and never forget the thousands of innocent lives lost on 911 and subsequent terrorist attacks. We should never forget the brave work of those professionals in the military and intelligence communities who paid the ultimate price in the effort to combat a grave threat to this nation's safety and security.How many times do you hear this from a CIAPentagonWH spokesperson?Yes never discount and never forget the victims of 911 we heard their voices we saw the London bus bombing survivors bloody faced eager to share their story. But we can well forget hundreds of thousands innocent civilians killed by US forces in the past ten years not single one of them had a place in this film. We saw angry Pakistanis gathered in front of American embassy jumping like savages. But we would not see those CIA drone strikes bombing Pakistani wedding killing women and children. They hate us for our freedom! we saw Mayor Bloomberg repeat Bush's line. Yes never forget the brave work of those professionals in the CIA they worked their ass out torturing terrorists what a psychological trauma it would be watching so many naked men every day? But we can certainly forget there was also innocent people got kidnapped tortured by these brave professionals. Forget torture is a war crime we got Ben Laden.Those of us who work in the arts know that depiction is not endorsement. Mrs. Bigelow defends her film in her LA Times piece. No Mrs. Bigelow your film is not art. There's no art without truth.".

Unlike the Hurt Locker which by opening with a quote from Chris Hedges gives a false impression of an antiwar movie ZDT is at least honest. At the very beginning it gives us a warningBased on firsthand accounts of actual eventsAka what CIA told us and what CIA wants you to see.The decadelong war on terror seen through a CIA agent's eyes the whole film is shaped into a CIA narrative. As Mrs. Bigelow wrote in her LA Times article defining ZDT's raison d'tre we should never discount and never forget the thousands of innocent lives lost on 911 and subsequent terrorist attacks. We should never forget the brave work of those professionals in the military and intelligence communities who paid the ultimate price in the effort to combat a grave threat to this nation's safety and security.How many times do you hear this from a CIAPentagonWH spokesperson?Yes never discount and never forget the victims of 911 we heard their voices we saw the London bus bombing survivors bloody faced eager to share their story. But we can well forget hundreds of thousands innocent civilians killed by US forces in the past ten years not single one of them had a place in this film. We saw angry Pakistanis gathered in front of American embassy jumping like savages. But we would not see those CIA drone strikes bombing Pakistani wedding killing women and children. They hate us for our freedom! we saw Mayor Bloomberg repeat Bush's line. Yes never forget the brave work of those professionals in the CIA they worked their ass out torturing terrorists what a psychological trauma it would be watching so many naked men every day? But we can certainly forget there was also innocent people got kidnapped tortured by these brave professionals. Forget torture is a war crime we got Ben Laden.Those of us who work in the arts know that depiction is not endorsement. Mrs. Bigelow defends her film in her LA Times piece. No Mrs. Bigelow your film is not art. There's no art without truth.";

	schema:headline " The Straightforward Hunt";
	schema:reviewBody "One's appeal for Zero Dark Thirty is to see how it depicts the search for Osama Bin Laden like it seems too impossible to find him like he's probably already dead or almost doesn't exist. Even though there are controversies going around and some revelations the story is still all dramatized. Without a surprise from director Kathryn Bigelow the film is totally electrifying and deliberately engrossing. There is humanity left in the end that made this a lot more compelling but that's the last thing we should talk about. It never backs away from the promise and stays focus on the mission. Zero Dark Thirty is a powerfully gripping thriller.It's a straightforward mission and only about the mission. We can see the main protagonist's obsession of capturing Bin Laden even without showing any backstories. She's brave probably too brave enough on what she's doing. They have to make difficult decisions to where are they gonna go or who are they gonna find. The film is indeed a dramatize version of the ten year hunt. It plays too much suspense and sudden shock but no matter what every tragic event are still portrayed in a completely terrifying way.There is no doubt this film will fall into a controversy. It features a torture scene that many think they justify it. It is so talked about and was against it but it seems the scenes only exists nothing more than showing that sort of truth. The most awaited part of the movie is indeed the climax. Just like anyone would imagine it's a silent and mercilessly violent raid. There's a lot of humanity in the character Maya. As much as she aggressively wanted to find her target she still cannot stomach any brutal interrogation and tragedy happening on her associates and other people. Jessica Chastain manages to weigh all of her personalities. Other strong actors like Jason Clarke Kyle Chandler Jennifer Ehle and Mark Strong keeps their roles effective as well.Kathryn Bigelow's prominent style is slick tension. Here she displays danger in any place where the characters go like something will suddenly explode or a loud gunfire. The action scenes is filled with suspense. One of the sequences can be tad too ridiculous for this movie but it didn't ruin a single thing to the experience. When it takes place inside the CIA or a meeting it gets undeniably absorbing. The screen writing makes sure it's factual enough and interesting.People's expectations might mislead them. Zero Dark Thirty is not only about finding and killing Osama Bin Laden but it's also about one's obsession and revenge to this terrorist. In the end there's plenty of guilt to express but that proves that they are still human beings. We could merit its brilliant filmmaking and strong storytelling that made it feel like we're part of the search. We all know this is just a dramatization of the true events but all the horrifying truths like the violence stays to the picture. It's a story with nobody calling themselves heroes even though they defeated their enemy. It depicts the darkest parts of its history. Some might wonder how worse it could have been but ignoring all the commotion Zero Dark Thirty is still a compelling thriller.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have not seen much of director Dino Risi's work but this film is clearly not one of his best efforts. The script doesn't seem very original either based on a novel by Mino Milani which mixes romance and mystery with a bit of horror and gore. We have seen it all before a man meets by chance an old lover and the relationship is rekindled. The hitch is that the woman could be dead and he is having an affair with a ghost. Is she or isn't she? The whole movie runs on that premise except for a subplot in which another woman is brutally murdered and her runaway nephew is the main suspect. This adds the possibility of a diabolical revenge to our reunited love birds.The atmospheric color cinematography by veteran Tonino Delli Colli is adequate and there's some great music in the proceedings but if it were not for the magnificent Romy Schneider and the equally great Marcello Mastroianni all the mayhem would have been unbearable.By the way this review is based on a DVD released in Spain which lists length as 85 minutes approx.".

	schema:reviewBody "''I had to tame him'' Pi realizes. ''It was not a question of him or me but of him and me. We were literally and figuratively in the same boat. From Life of Pi by Yann Martel.You will see no more imaginative film this year than Life of Pi whose conceit of a young Indian boy stranded with a Bengal Tiger in a lifeboat amid the Pacific Ocean is fantastical yet real in its metaphoric implications. While the framing device of a story told to a stranger uses the old flashback the lonely lifeboat is as new as any story told in the last century.The film begs interpretation from the multiplicity of religions to the place of mankind in a hostile Darwinian world. Ultimately the benign brotherhood of beasts and humans is affirmed not so much by lofty philosophy but by the necessity of man and beast working together to survive.The digital rendering of animals especially the Bengal Tiger is beautiful to behold. The opening scene in Pi's family zoo could be right out of Terence Malick's visionary camera a montage of nature gorgeous in its simplicity. The several formalistic shots of the boat at night are worthy of the best lighting in the best aquariums in the world. Together with the impressive use of 3D director Ang Lee has visually taken us from the opulence of Crouching Tiger and the minimalism of Brokeback Mountain into a fusion world of fancy and reality. The images are stunning.In the end Lee is interested in the individual's place in the universe as he struggles to harness nature and yet live in harmony with these elements. The conflict with the gross cook aboard the Japanese cargo ship taking Pi's family and animals to Canada is emblematic of the challenges facing the gifted with the groundlings. Pi's relationship with tiger Richard Parker represents all mankind's struggle to live in harmony with the forces it cannot control.Believing in everything is the same as believing in nothing says Pi's father because Pi samples religions from Hinduism and Buddhism to Catholicism and Judaism and wants them all. Although it is not given to us to have them all Pi's piety practically makes us believers in the universal brotherhood.The Life of Pi is everyone's life the film is one of the best of the year and even remembering the greatness of The Old Man and the Sea Moby Dick and Billy Budd the best you will ever see about a boy a tiger and a boat.".

Granted the movie was very beautiful but in the end Life Of Pi was more character driven than anything. Suraj Sharma as the young Pi was charming funny and incredibly engaging while Irrfan Khan as the older Pi was fantastically genuine and warm. Adil Hussain as Pi's father was also a joy to watch. The characters are so rich and full of life that you really can't help but fall in love with them. I would also like to add as someone who spends time with tigers on a daily basis the animators did a wonderful and accurate job of bringing Richard Parker to life and making him the active and vital character that is so incredibly essential to the success of this story. I would recommend seeing Pi in 3D but I don't think that's it's essential to your viewing enjoyment. The 3D just takes a beautiful film and makes it a little bit nicer. Also if you've read the book and are concerned that the story you loved may have been compromised in anyway worry no longer. This is easily one of the best book to film adaptations I have ever seen.Happy viewing folks. I hope you enjoy this film as much as I did. I'll be seeing it again in theaters very soon.".

It is narrated by both young Pi and the Adult Pi it uses music all the time so there is not space for uncomfortable silents and the rhythm of the scenes is fast. The result a very entertained film.The most important thing of this film is it character. It is obvious because we are seeing for almost 2 hours just one character. So it is not only important to have a great character that appeals to the audience feelings but to have an actor that portray this person the right way. Suraj Sharma was brilliant as Pi. He can make happy scenes as equal as sad desperate hopelessness exhaustion and anger ones. Very few movies allow an actor represent so many emotions.But if Pi is a good character Richard Parker can only be describe as unique. The tiger as personality of it's own. Not many films can make an animal with so many human features and yet never stop being a wild animal. This tiger is computed animated but the audience will barely notice because the way it walks eats its factions the eyes. It doesn't matter if it is computer animation Richard Parker is alive and is his own character just as important as Pi is.If you think that Rise of the Planet of the Apes have good animal effects you have to see how this people make a zebra a hyena and a orangutan. All this combine with a photography created by the same guy that make Tron Legacy looks so cool and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button so beautiful Claudio Miranda makes it an incredible experience to see.This movie is definitely an Oscar runner for Special Effects Cinematography Director and Movie of the year.".

In order to avoid it once in high school he finally shortens his name to Pi Patel... Nowadays middleaged Pi tells the story of his life to a visiting writer apparently a book author Yan Martel's alter ego who is seeking for the literal inspiration. Retrospectively Pi divides his childhood and adolescence into three segments. In the first segment he gives shorter account of his life until the age of 16 describing his interaction with his family and schoolmates in particular his relationship with his father and a girlfriend concentrating on his exploits of God and spirituality meandering between multitude of religious practices while in the last one he briefs about his testimonial given to officials from the Japanese Ministry of Transport investigating the reasons why the ship his family was relocating on from India to Canada sank. Most detailed and therefore the longest is recollection of his 227 days in a lifeboat an extraordinary ordeal he went through after the ship has capsized and everybody else crew and passengers died Well everybody human but not everybody living. Namely a number of terrestrial animals from their discontinued family zoo offered for sale and brought along with other family belongings have survived too. But not for long because while confined in the most limited space as they were surrounded by vastness of the ocean the law of the survival of the fittest prevails takes its tall and pretty soon Pi finds himself in a company of a single one topping the foodchain a Bengal tiger curiously named Richard Parker. Not to reveal the story further it is with greatest pleasure to inform that cinematic excellence has been achieved in several categories in an engaging talewhether allegory or depiction of realistic believable events filled with protagonist's rarely matched curiosity imagination and his often reasonably unanswered doubts encouraging the same in viewersof an uncommon character indeed brought to onscreen life by outstanding performances from two contributing leads remarkably presented via ubiquitous yet inconspicuous animation exceptional CGI aided visuals and superb usage of 3D photography all along complemented with an uplifting score. All these assets work seamlessly together in unfolding an intense relationship between Pi and Richard Parker complex yet basic difficult yet simple initially charged with Pi's dreadful fear swiftly shifting to respectful care instantly boosting his never overbearing confidence and relentlessly improving his survival skills. Wholesome artistic experience reaches and maintains its pinnacle particularly in clever tactics and constructive survival techniques 16year old Pi usesamply benefiting from his instructive lifestyle of a zoo owner's attentive son certainly well acquainted with animal psychologyto suppress the fear and convincingly impose himself as an equal to the one of the most elaborate killing machines among mammals desperately striving for his own survival nevertheless generously for survival of his seemingly sufficiently tamed companion but still initially and ultimately magnificent adversary Richard Parker as well.Life of Pi is certainly one of the most impressive movies of 2012 year that has just come to a close.".

Namely a number of terrestrial animals from their discontinued family zoo offered for sale and brought along with other family belongings have survived too. But not for long because while confined in the most limited space as they were surrounded by vastness of the ocean the law of the survival of the fittest prevails takes its tall and pretty soon Pi finds himself in a company of a single one topping the foodchain a Bengal tiger curiously named Richard Parker. Not to reveal the story further it is with greatest pleasure to inform that cinematic excellence has been achieved in several categories in an engaging talewhether allegory or depiction of realistic believable events filled with protagonist's rarely matched curiosity imagination and his often reasonably unanswered doubts encouraging the same in viewersof an uncommon character indeed brought to onscreen life by outstanding performances from two contributing leads remarkably presented via ubiquitous yet inconspicuous animation exceptional CGI aided visuals and superb usage of 3D photography all along complemented with an uplifting score. All these assets work seamlessly together in unfolding an intense relationship between Pi and Richard Parker complex yet basic difficult yet simple initially charged with Pi's dreadful fear swiftly shifting to respectful care instantly boosting his never overbearing confidence and relentlessly improving his survival skills. Wholesome artistic experience reaches and maintains its pinnacle particularly in clever tactics and constructive survival techniques 16year old Pi usesamply benefiting from his instructive lifestyle of a zoo owner's attentive son certainly well acquainted with animal psychologyto suppress the fear and convincingly impose himself as an equal to the one of the most elaborate killing machines among mammals desperately striving for his own survival nevertheless generously for survival of his seemingly sufficiently tamed companion but still initially and ultimately magnificent adversary Richard Parker as well.Life of Pi is certainly one of the most impressive movies of 2012 year that has just come to a close.";

Not even a single moment is dull in fact the story is woven so tightly that you never realize that the script is so simple. It is beautifully directed and kudos to Ang Lee not only was he able to capture the beauty of India he was also able to get the best of the actors. Though it does not rank too high on 3D its just visually mesmerizing. My trust and faith in Ang Lee has gone up to the highest level after watching this movie..Luckily I was able to catch the premiere show and will continue to relish the after effects of the movie for the next few days!".

	schema:reviewBody "Ang lee's life of pi is an adaptation of a 'Man booker prize winner' novel by the same name written by Yann Martel. It's a story set in the late seventies of an Indian teenager Pi Patel who is stranded on a life boat in the pacific. What distinguishes this tale of survival from the rest is that the author dishes out a delicious slice of creativity in giving the castaway a tiger for a companion. Yes like the posters and trailers have you believe there is a boat on which a man and a tiger have to live! This makes 'life of pi' not only a story of human struggle against nature but also a profound tale that questions 'what separates man from beast?'. More interestingly 'when does man become a beast'? But worry not Ang Lee's movie does not force you think on these lines  instead it's a film that lets you enjoy it on so many levels. If you are just looking for a beautiful 3D movie to feast your eyes  Life of pi can be it. If you are in a mood for a thrilling adventure epic on weekend this is the right ticket. If indeed you want to experience something thoughtful Life of pi never forces you on a particular thought instead it whispers ever so slightly to think about matters of human disposition and finding comfort in convention while caressing your senses with fabulous visuals and background score. Suraj Sharma debuts as pi with utter sincerity while Irfan Khanas adult pi and Tabuas mother do justice to their parts. The rest of the supporting cast blend in perfectly too. Ang lee helms the film with difficult source material with absolute grace and expertise. However there are two true heroes that make Life of Pi work. Firstly the studio and creative director behind the magnificent CGI. The Bengal tiger is perhaps the best animated animal ever created! The angry green eyes richly textured orange white striped skin and every hair on its fur look rich and full of life in 3D.And then when your hear the thunderous roar for the first time you will realize this is as real as it can get! The rest of the animals a Zebra an orangutan look great too. The lovely blue ocean and its resident creatures are the jewel in the crown. The other hero is the writer David Mageescreenplay who adapts the novel with near perfection. One gripe the fans of the novel might have is the lack of all the gore descriptions and a particular chapter that deals with the surviving 'French cook'. The addition of these might have pleased the audience who sought for the philosophical undertones from the story but the film would have lost out on the large PG13 crowd a fair deal considering the enormous budget. Life of Pi is a rare masterpiece that stands as a prototype not only for a perfect book adaptation and a 3D movie sorry avatar you have just been replaced but also for a movie based on intricacies of human nature . Now that is simply an impressive triumph of filmmaking!".

I couldn't tell the difference between what was real and what wasn't. Not one moment did I doze off. Definitely worth 127 minutes of your life. Ang Lee you did an outstanding job. To the Cast you all did excellent. I am very satisfied! Although there were a lot of pros there were some cons. At one point the Format of the Film switched from 169 to 43 but that might have been the projector at the Cinemark I attended. I also noticed some of the animations of animals started to go off screen and you could see the animated objects in the black area of the Wide Screen part I'm assuming that was for the 3D but I watched it in 2D so it looked sketchy. But it's minor. An average viewer won't even notice it I'm an aspiring filmmaker and I notice the little things!! I enjoyed the film and you will too. 910. Worth it.".

By maintaining hope we try to live up to their expectation knowing that God will guide us if we keep fighting on our endeavor for greater good. That's pretty much the whole and soul of the movie. Opened first time in India at IFFI 2012 Goa I was in the mix of lucky few who got to watch the repeat show of this 3D movie adapted from Yann Martel's book of same title.Piscine MolitorPi Patel as he was named after a swimming pool by his dear uncle apparent by his ardent love for the same. Piscine is born Hindu in Pondicherry India but as he levels a understanding he begins to peek into other religion and sooner he starts endorsing Christianity and Islam also. His father a zoo owner pounces upon a chance of relocating the zoo to Canada. On their way to far west with animals on a Japanese ship tragedy struck on a murderous stormy night capsizing the ship with Pi and a Royal Bengal Tiger left to see the remains. And so the adventures journey of innocent young boy with life threatening feline animal begins.There was the thunderous applause from the audiences when the tiger gives his first appearance in the safety boat. Spending months to produce the Tiger didn't go waste too he looked inch perfect and the way he has been handled in the movie is exquisite. The first few scenes are reminiscent of old India with bullock carts later the landscape changes and so do the people. The characters of hot blooded modern day father the supporting mother and the story involving the tender love between the protagonist and the girl are delightful however short they may be. The innocence of young Pi through his school years and his introduction to motley of faiths sets up the foundation to his uncanny characterization. But the real fun starts when they are both lost at sea and Pi tries assortment of ideas to keep him as well as the Tiger alive. The movie is never complete without the mention of adequately yet delicately used VFX. It would really be a shame to put into words those magnificently shot sequences and the scale on which the art work is done. This movie epitomizes the correct commixture of story with special effects. I could gather so many 'wows' while I was myself devouring on the same scenes. The humor is well prevalent and does lighten up the few still scenes between the two.Suraj Sharma plays the most significant role in the movie with all his efforts and he wins it in the end. The guy is awesome handling some tough intense scenes in the movie. Irfan Khan playing the narrator as well as the older Pi shows his maturity in the business patient with the small parts he never misses his character and his narration and dialog's delivery is to die for. Adil Hussain as Pi's father is superb with his character and does contribute a hell lot. Other actors contribute evenly including the computer generated zoo animals. Real salute to the art directors of the movie for putting up such beautiful pictures on screen. Ang Lee is as always incomparable with his cinema he has definitely reached shore with this movie and a more versatile director in my book.The older promises the character he is narrating that he will prove him that God exists well did he or not? For that you have to wait for that amazing climax scene. This is art storytelling and VFX at his best in a single movie. Who would want to miss that??".

Such brilliant cinematic quality is very rare and it needs to be experienced on the hugest screen possible. It's why we go to the movies for. Ang Lee's direction is minimalistic and focused. Gentle and caressing. He does not make movies. He nurtures a baby and lets him out to play with us when he deems fit.The end is somewhat abrupt in it's flow but nevertheless compelling in it's effect. Suraj Sharma as Pi is very good. Tabu impresses in her short role and Aadil Hussain is effective. But like it's always in almost every movie that he does it's the brilliant Irrfan Khan who etches out the older Pi with an absolutely touching performance. 'Life Of Pi' without any overstatement is a landmark achievement. It's a shining crown jewel in this oceanic gigantic world of cinema. Something to be cherished and admired. And something that doesn't happen very often.I just told you two stories. Which one do you prefer? The one with the Tiger. And so it is with God.I'm a believer.

'Life Of Pi' without any overstatement is a landmark achievement. It's a shining crown jewel in this oceanic gigantic world of cinema. Something to be cherished and admired. And something that doesn't happen very often.I just told you two stories. Which one do you prefer? The one with the Tiger. And so it is with God.I'm a believer. In something not very different from God I think.And yes always the one with the Tiger.";

	schema:reviewBody "I found this film ultimately unsatisfying. Granted it is visually stunning but that in itself doesn't justify the running time. I found myself wondering what the point of the film was at all. If I'm rightit is a pseudo mystical  philosophical propaganda piece which suggests that it is better to hold tight to a fantastical improbable story of triumph over adversity ie your faith in God whoever that is if it gives you hope and gets you through life  rather than to endure a harsh unpalatable reality. The whole film is geared up to asking the question of the viewer  which do you prefer the outlandish fantasy or the grim truth? I'm not sure it's even answerable unless you have a faith which you want to reaffirm. So when the question came I thought Is that it? Is that what you've been waiting to pose? The majority of the film covers a boy's struggle to survive a shipwreck cast away on a small lifeboat in the company of a Bengal tiger. The story is told in retrospective by the boy Pi as an adult. It is clear to the viewer that this is a tall tale from Pi's general style of story telling a colourful childhood an eccentric swimmingobsessed uncle. We can tell that his style is somewhat unreliable. Therefore I didn't exactly buy into the survival story. I wasn't rooting for him and there was no emotional attachment to the character in the way there would have been if this was a straight forward recounting of what happened. What I was thinking was when is this part going to end so that I can get on with finding out what's really going on in the film? By that I don't mean that I was particularly interested in the true survival story which when it came was pretty grim although that might have been a more interesting film!. I really wanted to know why the film maker thought it was so important to take us on this fantastical journey. When the answer came in all its semiphilosophical shallowness it wasn't worth the wait.".

So now it's screened elsewhere I can pitch in my thoughts.Life of Pi is a film that absolutely surprised me. I had not read the book so I wasn't quite sure what to expect but I knew that a film from Ang Lee would be exceptionally well done and I wasn't wrong. This is an incredibly strong work on par with Crouching Tiger .. Not through action or events but in the way the cinematography camera movements and beautiful settings help draw a viewer in and really sell the story.The Life of Pi is so well crafted that it moves effortlessly between a story of youth to a story of adulthood. If you have not read the book the ending is the kind of twist that while completely understandable redefines your entire film experience in a way I hadn't been a part of since The Sixth Sense. You immediately think back over the entirety of the film and see it in a drastically different way and it works.No matter the perspective you chose this is an amazingly well acted well directed film that goes into my list of some of the best films I've seen this year.I watched in 3D but this is a film full of so many bright colors and scenes that I will seek out a chance to see it in 2D just for the beauty of the scenes.

It was no surprise to me then when I discovered Ang Lee's faithful film adaptation to be exactly that  mildly entertaining touching lightly on the philosophical side.I believe a lot of people came to watch this movie with many different expectations from those who wanted to watch a realistic seasurvival movie contrasted by those who believed it would offer something truly deep and significant philosophically. Both these camps will be disappointed. As Jonathan Romney says in the IOS review Life of Pi is fatally scuppered by coy bogus mysticism. Conversely as you will read on the message boards here at IMDb spoilers abound there be forewarned! a lot of people couldn't even handle the philosophylite that was on offer and were disappointed that it wasn't the straight forward boylostatseawithatiger story it falsely claimed to be deep breath. Hey everybody this film will not change your life. It will provide you with some inoffensive entertainment for a couple of hours and probably little more.Life of Pi  whether in bookform or in this adaptation  is neither high art nor gruelling adventure. What it actually is is a fantasy story framed at the edges with a smidgeon of realism in an attempt to add a soupon of depth and foodforthought. Approach the film as such and you may well enjoy it. As a heavily CGIed film it provides at times a stunning visual work. Again reviewers have been mixed some claiming that the overplaying of visuals falls into the garish and attempts to wash over the philosophical shallowness of the movie. Well CGI is the trend today it has some benefits but the overall effect of digitally rendering your characters and sceneries is bound to leave something missing soulwise. Life of Pi is pretty enough to look at but personally I think much more could and would have been made of it if it was adapted as an classic style animation.I'd mark the film as 6.5 it made my partner cry but I'm rounding down this time because of the sudden wave of sycophancy present on IMDb meaning that every film that comes out has 8pointsomething corporate presence?. Either way a pleasant break from Hollywood aggression and worth a watch.".

	schema:headline " This is a picture of sheer power and beauty";
	schema:reviewBody "Life of Pi is one of the most marvelous theater experiences I've had all year. Its Oscar for art direction and cinematography should already be locked in. It's a film of incorruptible beauty and deeply satisfying drama which squeezes so much power and emotion out of its audience that they leave feeling riveted at the same time drained. You can bet the film's main character feels the exact same way.Our main character is an adult named Piscine Molitor who goes by the name Pi Patel and we meet him as an adult played by Irrfan Khan who begins telling his long lifestory to a writer planning to adapt it Rafe Spall. It's a story that tested him as a person in every possible way and it all goes back to when his parents made the decision to move from India to Canada and because Pi's father was a zookeeper take many animals such as orangutans zebras goats and tigers with them on an enormous ship across the Pacific Ocean. Before this move Pi was an optimistic soul who ventured out as a young boy beyond his comfort zone in his Hindu religion to seek out other walks of faith specifically Christianity and Islam which he began following all at once.During the move a wild violent storm hits the ocean flooding the ship and sending Pi a zebra with a broken leg a hyena an orangutan and a tiger named Richard Parker on a lifeboat leaving behind the several other animals and Pi's entirely family. This whole sequence which lasts around five minutes feels like the entire movie The Perfect Storm shortened from its original twohour length only it emphasizes the emotional elements. This is one of the saddest scenes of the year as we see a teenage Pi now played by Suraj Sharma desperately hold onto the lifeboat for dearlife while being washed away from his mother father and siblings and there is absolutely nothing he can do about it. Between you and I reader this is one of the most emotionally upsetting scenes this and the ending of the film I've ever sat through in a theater.Now Pi is stranded in the middle of the Pacific with an open sky four different animals until they are picked off with only the tiger remaining and his own will to live. The remainder of the film forgoes the backandforth narrative between adult Pi telling the story to the writer but remains focused on his own recollection of events on that lifeboat and the acts of bravery he committed to keep him and the tiger alive. While Pi and Richard Parker are sharing the boat that does not mean they get along. Writer David Magee makes no mistake in illustrating that while they are stranded together Pi is a human boy and Richard Parker is a Bengal tiger. The beauty of this picture is that it never mistakes that the only common traits between these two souls is that they are stranded together and both are mammals.Life of Pi's visuals are astounding. Long shots that hold on the vast emptiness of the Pacific are invigorating because of their wide range of beauty and clarity sequences of peril and uncertainty are captured through an equally clear vivid lens making them all the more real and enthralling and atmospherically the picture shows the dangers and the loneliness of the ocean better than any film I have yet to see.Thematically the picture focuses on predominately on the idea of survival and spirituality which gratefully helps Pi keep hope and optimism during these gruelingly unforgiving days. One of the most intense and poignant scenes comes when Pi is faced with the task of killing a large fish. He is starving and becoming skinnier by the day so he fiercely grabs a fish out of the water and begins hacking at it with a small axe. When the fish is bloody and long dead he begins to sob tears of joy and sadness joy because he finally has a decent portion of food yet sadness in the idea that he has killed a living creature and is about to abandon his vegetarian vow. It's a scene that once more clouded my eyes with tears just like Pi's of joy and sadness. This is a picture of sheer power and beauty. A film that clearly tests its lead actor Sharma who is inhabiting his first main role and a film that will hopefully go on to live with a reputation of one of cinema's supreme achievements. It must be said that in Ang Lee's twenty year film career that he has tackled almost every genre in the medium and done so with an extraordinary amount of confidence. His directorial efforts too have not been minor additions to the genre but true gamechangers if anything. Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon was a martial arts film filled with depth and delight. Hulk was a superhero movie that added so much weight to its characters and relationships you'd think Christopher Nolan's modernday Dark Knight franchise was taking notes from it. And Brokeback Mountain was for the most part a lively portrayal of two men who've kept their orientation silent for so long that they begin to embrace it by meeting each other out of the blue. Life of Pi offers more of the same grandiose ideas from the brilliant visionaire and its shocking smoothness in terms of filming placement and writing is beyond fabulous and wildly consuming because of its clarity. This is one of the best films of the year and onpar with the depth and cinematography in Samsara making this year one of the most beautiful.".

	schema:headline " Why 'Life Of Pi' is a film with a terrible message";
	schema:reviewBody "I went to see 'Life Of Pi' in 3D as I'd heard what an amazing lifechanging movie it was and that it was one of the best uses of 3D ever. Unfortunately it was neither of these things. Theoretically it's a movie which few people should actually like and should offend religious people yet almost everyone seems to be lapping it up like God's very own ejaculate.I'll get the 3D aspect out of the way first. Whilst the visuals were brilliant beautiful and sometimes breathtaking with vibrant fluorescent colours there wasn't a single shot of 3D in the entire film that made me think 'that's impressive use of 3D' and I'm a fan of good 3D. Whilst Pi was poking a stick at the screen instead of it coming out at me in 3D it was a rather pathetic unfocused blur.The film is about a boyyoung man called Pi who was shipwrecked. A writer tracks him down as he hears Pi has a wonderful story that will supposedly make him believe in God. Pi tells the story and it's incredibly longwinded with nothing remotely miraculous in it mostly just a load of bad luck. Most of the story is Pi and a tiger stuck on a small rescue boat and whilst that's interesting for a while after about an hour it becomes really rather tedious.Pi then tells a second story which is the true version of events and there's nothing remotely miraculous in that one either again just a load of bad luck. At this point I was thinking 'I cannot believe I've spent about an hour watching Pi and a tiger on a boat when it never even happened and he was just bullstting us'.So basically he tells two stories one of which is lies and one true. He then asks the writer which story he prefers and he says he The one with the tiger. That's the better story. Pi responds Thank you. And so it goes with God. However just because the writer preferred the first story doesn't mean he now believes in God like Pi claimed he would he merely liked the first story better. Just like Pi's first story this claim is more bullst from a compulsive liar. Personally I liked the second story much better which was never even shown merely given a brief spoken account of. It sounded like it would have made a far better movie than an hour on a boat befriending a tiger. What Pi should have said is that the two stories he was about to tell would make the writer understand the nature of faith better not make him believe in God.The messagewhich began with Pi as a kid following three different religions and ended with him spelling out that that it doesn't matter which storyreligionbelief is true just follow the one you like the best and comforts you the most is a terrible message. It teaches people that it's OK to believe in lies instead of the truth to follow a religion just because it has a nice story and maybe even follow a few simultaneously then you can enjoy all the various stories.The movie tries to have an openminded positive message about religion encompassing them all. That's all very well for teaching tolerance of other religions but as a message it's problematic as I just find it so flaky. Since when has the truth been so unimportant? The truth is important and I won't let this illthoughtout movie tell me otherwise. As someone who doesn't agree with the concept of believing in lies just to comfort oneself with a nice story the message went against what I believe.Furthermore I don't understand how anyone religious could like the movie either. Surely the whole point of religion is to follow it because you actually believe it to be the truth not just because it's comforting and a nice story. If I was religious then I would find this message patronising and offensive. Religious people praising the movie can only mean one of two things 1 They're fully aware that their religion is a lie and don't care as they're happy just liking the story 2 They didn't get the message of the film. Neither of these reasons are anything to be proud of.The only demographic I would imagine liking this film are flaky people and people who think being flaky is acceptable or even admirable. According to IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes this is over 80 of the population. I can't say I find THAT true story very comforting but as the truth is apparently not important maybe I should believe that nobody is flaky and everyone else agrees with me and sees 'Life Of Pi' for what it really is. If there's one thing I can't stand it's flakiness it's annoying and you never know where you stand with such people or what they stand for.I liked the idea of a story being too traumatic to tell so giving a false version with symbolism instead but the message about religion was stupid. If people simply enjoyed the journey then that's fine but it isn't that interesting and without the message hollow. People thinking the message is wonderfully deep beautiful and philosophical however need to quit being such flakes and give themselves a slap. Yann Martel who wrote this 'lyingiswonderful' story needs to find another career and spare the world from more stupid messages.Other than impressive and beautiful visuals a few lines of good humour and a shipwreck this film had nothing for me. Plus it dragged like Ang Lee movies tend to I would honestly have preferred to sit through his 'Hulk' movie a second time. Pi is a boring timewasting flaky bullstting douche and I'd be grateful if next time he kept his illthoughtout tediously longwinded stories to himself.".

However just because the writer preferred the first story doesn't mean he now believes in God like Pi claimed he would he merely liked the first story better. Just like Pi's first story this claim is more bullst from a compulsive liar. Personally I liked the second story much better which was never even shown merely given a brief spoken account of. It sounded like it would have made a far better movie than an hour on a boat befriending a tiger. What Pi should have said is that the two stories he was about to tell would make the writer understand the nature of faith better not make him believe in God.The messagewhich began with Pi as a kid following three different religions and ended with him spelling out that that it doesn't matter which storyreligionbelief is true just follow the one you like the best and comforts you the most is a terrible message. It teaches people that it's OK to believe in lies instead of the truth to follow a religion just because it has a nice story and maybe even follow a few simultaneously then you can enjoy all the various stories.The movie tries to have an openminded positive message about religion encompassing them all. That's all very well for teaching tolerance of other religions but as a message it's problematic as I just find it so flaky. Since when has the truth been so unimportant? The truth is important and I won't let this illthoughtout movie tell me otherwise. As someone who doesn't agree with the concept of believing in lies just to comfort oneself with a nice story the message went against what I believe.Furthermore I don't understand how anyone religious could like the movie either. Surely the whole point of religion is to follow it because you actually believe it to be the truth not just because it's comforting and a nice story. If I was religious then I would find this message patronising and offensive. Religious people praising the movie can only mean one of two things 1 They're fully aware that their religion is a lie and don't care as they're happy just liking the story 2 They didn't get the message of the film. Neither of these reasons are anything to be proud of.The only demographic I would imagine liking this film are flaky people and people who think being flaky is acceptable or even admirable. According to IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes this is over 80 of the population. I can't say I find THAT true story very comforting but as the truth is apparently not important maybe I should believe that nobody is flaky and everyone else agrees with me and sees 'Life Of Pi' for what it really is. If there's one thing I can't stand it's flakiness it's annoying and you never know where you stand with such people or what they stand for.I liked the idea of a story being too traumatic to tell so giving a false version with symbolism instead but the message about religion was stupid. If people simply enjoyed the journey then that's fine but it isn't that interesting and without the message hollow. People thinking the message is wonderfully deep beautiful and philosophical however need to quit being such flakes and give themselves a slap. Yann Martel who wrote this 'lyingiswonderful' story needs to find another career and spare the world from more stupid messages.Other than impressive and beautiful visuals a few lines of good humour and a shipwreck this film had nothing for me. Plus it dragged like Ang Lee movies tend to I would honestly have preferred to sit through his 'Hulk' movie a second time. Pi is a boring timewasting flaky bullstting douche and I'd be grateful if next time he kept his illthoughtout tediously longwinded stories to himself.";

Realistically it would get maybe a 4 or 5 out of 10 but seeing as there's so many positive reviews here and all of them seem to be from either fanboys of the book or people who haven't seen very many movies at all I figured a 1 would be best to balance things out.No doubt the film has some humorous moments that are indeed very funny like the tiger peeing in Pi's face Pi's rules and what not and the film has tons of pretty visuals. A lot of the film takes place on a boat and at times it looks like they used a real ocean to film it on. Not to mention the jellyfish scene was pretty it was almost like James Cameron's Avatar. But... the plot is just so vapid and pretentious it defies description. Basically the film throws around a lot of religious references and it takes up a good portion of the plot but dear LORD most of the time the religious references were as subtle as bricks in a drying machine. At times it's like the writers are smacking you across the face with a bible. And when he father asked Pi as a child early in the film how many more religions are you going to convert to? or something like that I should have taken that as an indication as how the rest of the movie would be.Oh and the many random moments which included but weren't limited to the strange 235.1 Aspect ratio change where suddenly a bunch of fish start flying out of the water into the boat including WINGED fish that seemed like a Michael Bay wet dream a carnivorous island full of meerkats though to be fair the meerkats scene was like a cuteness overdose and humpback whale bit. Yeah. There were parts of the film I enjoyed but it honestly was just not a very good movie. It was like eating a platter full of candy and sugary sweets. Lots to indulge in and munch down on but you've devoured nothing of substance by the end and you're left with a stomach ache. And throwing a religious subtext in it doesn't mean the film is good or anything... It's just pretentious.So yeah like I said. Realistically my rating would be a 4 or 5 out of 10 but the 8.4 rating and amounts of 1010 reviews here is just ridiculous.".

A boy finds himself adrift at sea with a dangerous tiger after a horrific shipwreck. At the start of the film we are subjected to a meandering and drawnout set up for themes and characters that do not even see a reprise or conclusion before the end of the film. It really felt like this film was stretching every scene and concept to a breaking point to fill the three hour artistic precedent established by previous Oscar winners like Return of the King. It just drags and drags until we are finally privy to the main plot. But then the films biggest problem comes to a head the theme.The film's theme cannot even be adequately described as it lacks any focus or objectivity. It simply comes off as an overbearing theistic agenda slathered onto an unrelated story. It presents itself as a lesson about faith but doesn't convey this message in any other fashion than saying I had faith and I survived therefore you should have faith. As a critical thinker I simply counter the point by demonstrating that if a faithless person was put in the same position as the main character and made the same decisions since none of these decisions were based his faith they would have identical outcomes. There in lies the problem the lesson is not demonstrated through means of the story or character progression. It is literally told to you every few scenes via frequent and uninspired narration. The first rule in screen writing is a simple one Show don't tell. After all film is a visual medium. Apparently the screenwriter missed the memo.What else is there to say? The acting was wooden. The score was big but not memorable. The only thing I can give to the film's credit is some beautiful cinematography and an effective use of 3D. But presentation is all for naught if the story is ineffective and Life of Pi never once managed to grab me move me or convince me of anything.

Cinematographer Claudio Miranda captures the most uproarious and glorious shots captured this year thus far. The 3D effects are some of the best ever seen and feels absolutely necessary in a film so heavy handed with religious tones. What Mychael Danna achieves in Lee's film has just placed him in the forefront of great film composers working today. He continues to impress with his musical range envelopes the film's message and thematic narrative in somber and beautiful melodic notes. On Visual Effects alone Life of Pi will likely land a nomination for Best Picture. What Lee invents with the ocean and the integration of the tiger and the other animals is spectacular. He allows the mood of the film and the imagery to marry each other in a ceremonial experience that stands next to SciFi epics like Avatar 2009 and Hugo 2011.Newcomer Suraj Sharma puts a valiant effort in the role of Pi a performance that may land him more critical and impressive roles in the future. The work is reminiscent of great breakthrough performers like Rudy Youngblood Apocalypto 2006 and Dev Patel Slumdog Millionaire 2008 both were impressive turns but sadly will not catch any awards attention. Irrfan Kahn who has delivered in great supporting turns like The Namesake 2006 and A Mighty Heart 2007 could have his best chance ever for serious awards attention. His hurdle will be a minimal screen presence and a supporting actor race that's crowded with movie stars. Lee directs the film with a firm hand. He knows what he wants to say and for the most part gets his message across. Unfortunately an unfocused and at times jumbled screenplay by the great David Magee creates an atmosphere that relies more on the visuals then the narrative. Also I'm unfamiliar with the book by Yann Martel never read it before so I have nothing to compare it to but much of the story's elements of surprise feel rather cheap and illfitting. Not sure how it will play with others but the film remains pretty consistent on the entertainment sector. Lee explains his preparation for the film at the New York Film Festival with such passion and delight. He speaks about getting Sharma properly prepared by placing him on a boat in the middle of the ocean and meeting a real life shipwreck survivor Lee's love for the project comes through all four years in the making. It's a directorial achievement that the Director's branch of the Academy could easily get behind. The film lands solidly on the front door of awards season with ease and could rally a loyal legion of followers.

This movie was pretty hot and being discussed much in my country now. Some scenes are taking in Taiwan. I did not watch the book so i can't compare between book and movie. I recommend 3D caused some view will really touch you. For kids it is alright cause some bloody scene was adjusted. I think it is more than a story there are many points worthy of thinking. Nice try and nice working of Ang Lee!".

	schema:reviewBody "Before giving any review about the movie i must request everyone to watch this movie only in a 3D format because i feel it is one of the very few of the 3d movies which retains its soul despite being in 3d format and not being a mere sales technique. Life of Pi is not a story about survival as many of viewers who have and have not read the book mentioned it already. It is not a story about a cast away. It is much more than that. It is about faith religion endurance and most important of all relationships. I have not read the novel on which the movie is based but yet i can be pretty sure that the movie has done almost or complete justice to it. With no intentions of watching this movie i went in expecting nothing but came out thanking the ones who took me for this movie. Ang Lee has always had an incredible ability to depict human emotions in various ways and various characters which we have seen in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and Brokeback Mountain. But in this one he goes a step beyond and creates an emotion between a human and an animal. But it just doesn't end there he adds the flavor of perfection to the movie by giving incredible visuals. Now being stranded on a sea can be a boring script especially when you have a run time of 145 minutes but Ang Lee shows us so much in that time that you end up craving for more. With exceptional visuals and incredible performance by the lead Life of Pi is an unforgettable movie for me and it does make me believe in God. I am sure it will succeed in making a lot of other people believe. There are unforgettable moments in the movie and it is going to be extremely difficult for anyone to pick just one. But i am sure everyone will like the last ten minute of the movie which make you think and go through the movie again. I salute Ang Lee for such a beautiful depiction of the book and portraying so many beautiful things and putting the CGI and Animation to the right use. The movie is a pure piece of Art and must not be missed under any circumstances. I would really wish to see this movie in the IMDb top 250 list".

	schema:headline " Life of Pi";
	schema:reviewBody "I remember when the novel Life of Pi came out and how popular it was. I have never read the book but have read Beatrice and Virgil which is also by Pi author Yann Martel and was very impressed with it. The movie version of Life of Pi was nothing short of amazing. This is a film where everything seems to be done right. As readers of my reviews know I am not a fan of 3D or basically even in seeing films in 3D but to me Life of Pi was different. The 3D was not used in a self indulgent way to showcase today's technology or to brag about it later on like so much of Peter Jackson's later films have been. Instead the 3D in this film is done to further enhance emotions and to affect us while watching certain scenes. We often see scenes of absolute beauty and some that are frightening or perhaps ugly but the 3D here is put to good use and is not done in an overly flashy way. The story itself I found to be incredibly moving and also inspiring. I do not want to go into too many details about the plot so I do not spoil it for other viewers but this is at times a deeply spiritual film that most viewers should walk away with feeling moved and grasping things that they might not have before. That is unless they are totally hard of heart. Through the journey of the main character Pi he learns so many important life lessons and things he can use later on in life. The film shows that while he does go through some very difficult and challenging times that he does not quit or give up and has the willpower and the faith to persevere even if at times everything looks absolutely hopeless. By relying not only on himself but a higher power he is giving this endurance and strength to keep going and even during the most agonizing and stressful of times he still has that perseverance and does not give up. It shows us that through life's trials often something very good comes out of it. In life none of us like going through challenging or difficult times but I think all of us can say that through difficult situations that we have gone through that we have learned more about ourselves and have become better equipped for future situations as well. Trials often bring us closer to the things that are actually important and crucial to our lives but on the same thought I realize that others do not always respond to them as well and lean to things that could be detrimental to one's health such as drugs alcohol or sex but what if we relied on a higher power like Pi does in the film? Being a Christian myself I know all about that. Through my life I have gone through numerous trails in my life and I know that there will be more coming but through all of those trials I have been able to rely on God and while often in those situations I felt anxious or like giving up myself I learned that he was with me through those trials and he was not going to abandon me. Every rough or difficult situation in life I have gotten through. No going through it was not always easy or fun but at the end my relationship with God improved and it often allowed me to trust and rely on Him more. Often these trials seem to be pointing out something in our lives that we need to change about ourselves. It could be something like an addiction or some type of sin that while it may not seem so is actually harming us rather than bringing us joy or pleasure and do we really need those things in our life? What if we could live doing what is good for us and to keep our bodies healthy. Wouldn't that make us both happier healthier and more appreciative that we gave up our old ways of sin addiction and the things that caused us to stumble. Pi grows in this film as he goes through these trials. They mature him give him a stronger and more trusting relationship and understanding of God and helps prepare and shape him for what may come in days weeks or even years ahead. This was such a revelation to me seeing all this on screen. I knew all this beforehand but who doesn't need a reminder from time to time and a little encouragement never fails to help. What was often called an unfilmable book has turned into a motion picture experience that is something that I found beautiful for the eyes ears senses and my soul. I felt uplifted and encouraged as I left this film. It gave me so much to think about but also so much to be thankful for in my own life. Director Ang Lee and screenwriter David Magee have given us a beautiful film here that works as a technical achievement but on so many other levels as well. I hope that what I have said will not have turned off people from seeing it but rather given them a curiosity to go and see it for themselves and see what they discover or take away from it. This is a groundbreaking achievement in cinema and for our own selves as well. Be sure to see it on the big screen while you can. One of 2012's best films.".

In Berlin capital of the Third Reich Adolf Hitler proclaims that Germany will still achieve victory and orders his Generals and advisers to fight to the last man. Downfall explores these final days of the Reich where senior German leaders such as Himmler and Goring began defecting from their beloved Fuhrer in an effort to save their own lives while still others Joseph Goebbels pledge to die with Hitler. Hitler himself degenerates into a paranoid shell of a man full of optimism one moment and suicidal depression the next. When the end finally does comes and Hitler lies dead by his own hand what is left of his military must find a way to end the killing that is the Battle of Berlin and lay down their arms in surrender.";

	schema:reviewBody "Der Untergang makes you live the horrors and craziness of war. Bruno Ganz's interpretation of Adolf Hitler is worthy of an Oscar. He is completely believable. Also the rest of the cast performs admirably. You feel transported to Berlin as it was bombarded by the Russians. You get a very clear insight or an impression? in how the military decisions were taken during those final days of the war. The movie balances well between largescale effects of bombs exploding in ruined streets and depictions of different persons going though the experience  from Hitler and his staff in the wellprotected bunkers to the principal military commanders torn between reason and loyalty and German civilians trapped in an inferno. The movie is neither proNazi nor does it depict all Nazis as mindless monsters. It gives an impression of utter realism. Go see it in a good cinema  your seat will tremble as the bombs explode.

	schema:headline " The Most Impressive Depressive and Realistic Dramatic Movie about the World War II";
	schema:reviewBody "Der Untergang is certainly the most impressive depressive and realistic dramatic movie about the World War II ever made. I have never seen a film picturing the insanity of Hitler in his very last days in a bunker in Berlin with his high command and how the German people were hypnotized by him like in this film. Last year I saw the deceptive boring pretentious and overrated Molokh showing a caricature of Hitler and Eva Braun in Bavaria. But Der Untergang is awesome and comparable to Apocalypse Now! my favorite movie of war.Two years ago I saw the powerful Das Experiment and I was impressed with the work of Oliver Hirschbiegel. With Der Untergang this director is certainly included in my list of favorite directors. It is difficult to highlight one actor or actress in this constellation of stars but I was impressed with the performance of Bruno Ganz and his human Hitler totally different from the stereotypes usual in other movies. The cinematography and the battles are stunning and the scenario of Berlin completely destroyed recalled the neorealistic movie of Roberto Rossellini Germania Anno Zero.For those who know Germany and German people it is amazing to see how this wonderful country survived to the chaos destruction and lack of command arrived from the ashes like Phoenix and sixty years later is again one of the greatest nations. For those who might have believed in Hitler and his Nazi Party it is impressive to see how people is forgotten and treated without compassion by their leader in his last hours. And for those who love war I really recommend to watch this magnificent antiwar movie and see the behavior of the leaders and population when a war is lost. My vote is ten.Title Brazil A Queda! As ltimas Horas de Hitler The Fall! The Last Hours of Hitler".

	schema:headline " A deeply disturbing intimate portrait of the insanity of Hitler and the blind faith of his followers at the end.";
	schema:reviewBody "In recent years war films have given a new exposure to the sheer nature of war. In Saving Private Ryan Black Hawk Down and Born on the Fourth of July we were exposed to the realities that a soldier endures not only on the battlefield but what they take with them long after the battles end. However Downfall a German film nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the 2005 Oscars brings a unique perspective to the table. It is about the last days of Hitler and the Third Reich and the ultimate demise of both. More so than a war movie this feature exposes the insanity of Hitler and the blind faith of his followers at the end. It is a deeply disturbing intimate portrait of the cruelty that he inflicted not only upon 6 million Jews but ultimately on his own countryman at the end.Based on the book Inside Hitler's Bunker by Joachim Fest Downfall is in a word shocking. The last act in the great horrific play of the Third Reich plays out like that of a cultso many men and woman who swore allegiance to Hitler commit suicide by either shooting themselves in the head or by ingesting poison capsules. But the madness of Hitler himself is horrifically captivating. He changes his mind and opinion on a whim. One moment he advises his SSGuards and Generals to leave the city after learning that he does not have enough troops to protect Berlin. A particular one named Gruppenfhrer Hermann Fegelein  who was Eva Braun's brotherinlaw takes the Fuhrer for his word and leaves Berlin. When Hitler realizes this he denounces Fegelein and orders him executed. What is more Hitler discusses the final demise of the German people. He explains that this failure is not only that of the military but of the civilians themselves. As such his soldiers do not protect the people from the coming onslaught of the Soviet Army. He advises In a war as such there are no civilians. Hitler is recreated by the superlative performance of Bruno Ganz who appeared in the 2004 remake of The Manchurian Candidate. Ganz captures the movement voice even the involuntary shaking of Hitler's left hand so well that the audience would feel as if they are watching the dictator himself. We are often left with shivers down our spine at how realistic Ganz's depiction is. Surprisingly enough Thomas Kretschmann who played the Nazi captain that gave Wladyslaw Szpilman a coat and food in The Pianist is seen here as Fegelein. I first noticed Kretschmann as a German UBoat commander in 2000s U571. He is a remarkable actor who brings with him a demanding presence on the screen through his stern looks and ultimate resolve. Unfortunately my knowledge of Eva Braun other than Hitler's mistress is limited. So it was refreshing to see a film that revealed her. Based on Downfall's depiction Braun portrayed by Juliane Kohler was either one of the shallowest individuals I have ever seen or she was so blinded by her faith in Hitler that she disregarded almost any sense of reality. For example during Berlin's first days of bombardment she becomes bored with being in the bunker and orders a party in an above ball roomnot surprisingly during that party a shell lands nearby and blows out windows in the room. Secondly during later heavy bombardment realizing that she will commit suicide with Hitler she writes a letter to a relative where she states what jewelry she will leave behind. She is simply detached from reality and lost in the fanatical jargon of the Fuhrer. Certainly the film's most disturbing instances occur when Magda and Joseph Goebbels poison their children in the name of the Fatherland. One of their children a girl probably about 10 years old has a dim understanding of what is happening and refuses to take the drink given. She is then forced to drink it by her mother and a guard. Later on Magda would come into her children's room while they were asleep and would give them the final capsule to eliminate them. Downfall is certainly one of the most powerful film's I have ever seen. As stated above Hitler and his followers played out their existence as if they were in a cult. The blind faith of his followers and the insanity of the man are so well realized by director Oliver Herschbiegel that it changes one's perception from that of simply being history to that of realism. These events happened less than a century ago and although most have learned to forgive Germany's past no one will ever forget it. It is the stigma that haunts this generation of German youth because many of their grandparents or greatgrandparents were a part of one of history's most infamous armies. But the fact that this film is German was surprising to me. I would have guessed that no one in Germany would have wanted to dig up their past in this way. However if one looks at this film as closure to Germany's transgressions then maybe this new generation of German youth can learn to have a sense of national identity without the horrors of the past seen in their shadows.  out of ".

Bravo to director Oliver Hirschbiegel for doing this the right German way  for intrepidly tackling a period piece few German producers might.I'd had a chance to chat with the actors postscreening with lead actress Alexandra Maria Lara playing Traudl Junge candidly admitting the sheer amount of work she'd diligently invested in bringing her character to life  doubtless complicated by the death of Frau Junge in 2002. Her research however was clearly impeccable and left no stone unturned. Corinna Harfouch wasn't on hand  as Magda Goebbels. Pity because in many respects she convincingly stole the show. So rarely do we see Hitler on screen in modern days to allow us a glimpse into the horrifying nature of a madman bent on global domination.

	schema:reviewBody "This magnificent film goes where no one else dared to go to show us the last days of Adolf Hitler. The director Oliver Hirshbiegel working with a big cast brings to life the madness of the last days of the monster as observed by a young and impressionable secretary who witnessed most of the crisis.At the beginning of the film we watch as five young women are brought to be interviewed by Hitler for a job as his personal secretary. Young Traudl Junge is selected. She is a pretty woman who is naive in many ways and probably had no inkling about the trip she was going to embark.The film captures the tragic figure of Hitler as everything is caving in on him and his grand plans for victory. We watch a man at the beginning of the film that is still thinking he is in command of the German forces but his authority has eroded as it becomes clear to the people under him the war is lost and it will be a matter of time before they are defeated.We watch the life of privilege the higher ups led inside the bunker. It was a fortification in which all comforts the regular Germans could not imagine existed. We get to know the people in Hitler's inner circle. The Goebbels both Joseph and Magda supporters of the regime maintain the loyalty to the Fuhrer until the end. The scene where Magda Goebbels murders her children is hard to take and we keep sinking in our seats as we can't believe such cruelty existed. In her narrow view of things Magda must take her family with her to a death these children didn't deserve.The film is totally dominated by Bruno Ganz. As Hitler he makes us see this man as he probably was in real life. Mr. Ganz's uncanny resemblance with Hitler is what makes the film works the way it does. At times Mr. Ganz is totally irrational and at times he is presented as a lost man who can't see what he has done to Germany and to Europe and the world.As Traudl Junge the young secretary Alexandra Maria Lara gives a subtle performance. She saw plenty inside the bunker and lived to tell it to the world. The other excellent performance is given by Corinna Harfouch who as Mrs. Goebbels makes us cringe in horror because of what she is capable of doing. Juliane Kohler as Eva Braun is an enigma. At times she is presented as a carefree young woman who might have loved Hitler. Yet we don't ever know what made this Eva Braun tick. Ulrich Matthes as Joseph Goebbels and Heino Ferch as Albert Speer are equally effective playing these two men.The director and his team have to be congratulated for taking us on a voyage to see the last moments of the Third Reich.".

BUt it is also the only film in recent memory that had an almost physical impact on me. I left feeling disoriented and very disquieted a feeling that lasted for several hours.What we have here is an exercise in patience. A film that allows us to watch the disintegration of the largest empire in modern history from the inside out.

BUt it is also the only film in recent memory that had an almost physical impact on me. I left feeling disoriented and very disquieted a feeling that lasted for several hours.What we have here is an exercise in patience. A film that allows us to watch the disintegration of the largest empire in modern history from the inside out.

	schema:reviewBody "Downfall is the gripping depiction of the last few days of the Second World War in Europe as the Russians advance into Berlin and approach ever nearer the bunker of Adolf Hitler who still believes their advance can be stopped...Bruno Ganz turns in a terrific performance as Hitler paying great attention to detail including the regional accent and the effects of Parkinson's disease that really make him into a believable person which is a lot more frightening to watch than the usual twodimensional characterisations that are usually seen on screen. Ganz manages to dominate the screen with the same effectiveness that allowed Hitler to get followers of such devotion that despite his atrocities and the horror of the situation many are prepared to stay with him and fight to the death while the possibility of escape or surrender remains open to them. He is almost schizophrenic  at some moments he is almost gentle such as some of the scenes with his secretary then shortly afterwards he is practically foaming at the mouth in his contempt for the civilian population of Berlin who he will not raise a finger to try to save by surrendering to the Allies.The other actors are not very well known  at least on the international arena but this added greatly to the authentic feel. Some of the senior Nazi leaders are hardly more sympathetic than their Fuhrer  Himmler in particular shows only personal ambition while pretending loyalty. Other characters such as the caring SS doctor who finds elderly patients simply abandoned in a hospital or the father who desperately tries to persuade his son who must be around 1214 not to get involved and perish in a hopeless cause are succinctly realised.The film is expertly shot with the unreal atmosphere in the bunker captured perfectly where Hitler raves about army units that barely or cease to exist coming to the rescue of the Reich and orders oilfields recaptured for 'long distance missions' when the Russian troops are barely a few hundred metres away.There is no glory shown in the battle scenes as the outcome is always a foregone conclusion making the resulting deaths even more moving. Watching young children and old men trying to hold off the Russian advance with inadequate weaponry is tragic in the knowledge that they are dying for no real purpose other than the whims of a handful of madmen.Very few films have depicted the tragic waste of life that war provokes better than Downfall and this turns out to be one of the best movies concerning the conflict that claimed over 50 million lives.".

	schema:reviewBody "All I can say about Der Untergang is WOW! This is one of those rare films that prove that the darkest pages in our world history easily surpass the fiction tales of the most imaginative fantasist. This soontobe landmark in cinema portrays the final ten days of Hitler's reign at the well hidden bunker in Berlin. In the opening sequences we see how the Fhrer hires Traudl Junge flawless performance by Alexandra Maria Lara as his personal secretary and we largely witness the rest of the story from her viewpoint. Recent documentary footage with the real Junge is showed to audience at the end of the movie stressing even more that this is a very intelligent and carefully elaborated production. A form of criticism I often encountered stated that Hitler was portrayed too human by the Swiss actor Bruno Ganz. Let me tell you that people who claim this haven't got the slightest clue what they're talking about! It's true that Hitler sometimes strokes his dogor even gives a compliment to his servant for cooking him such a lovely dinner! But only moments after you're exposed to the real Hitler again! Alternately a madraving dictator a disillusioned conqueror or simply a pathetic old man. But perhaps the most astonishing scenes in Der Untergang are the ones in which the persons close to Hitler  either professional or amicable  remain unconditionally loyal to him! It is deeply disturbing to behold how so many people blindly swear by the unworldly beliefs of a madman even prepared to follow him into death. This accurate portrait results in a series of brilliant sequences with the severely shocking fate of the Goebbels family as an absolute highlight.Purely talking in terms of cinema Der Untergang comes dangerously close to perfection as well. The largest part of this film exists out of interior shots more specifically the bunkernetwork where Hitler lasted his final days and eventually committed suicide. And the atmosphere inside this bunker is reflected on the moviescreen as genuine as humanly possible. You can nearly smell the fear of the lowerranked officers! You can almost feel the shivering of the petrified secretaries! I really hate using a clich sentence like this butit's trueit's like you are there yourself! And you don't want to be there! Even the totally demolished streets of Berlin looks look more appealing than the claustrophobic Nazi bunker. This despicable chapter in history deserves an accurate and wellbudgeted cinema version if only just for passing on the inglorious stories of WWII to younger generations. Director Oliver Hirschbiegel terrifically turned Joachim Fest's novel into a mesmerizing film experience. Perhaps the most praiseworthy aspect about it all is that Der Untergang simply is a reconstruction of the facts! No lame and amateurish attempts to blame Hitler's actions on miserable childhoods or traumatizing experiences. Simply put this is fundamental viewing!".

	schema:reviewBody "Considering the fact how hard it is to make an adequate movie about the  Third Rich and especially Hitler himself Der Untergang is a superb  portrayal of the last days of Hitler his minions and the Third Rich.  First of all Bruno Ganz' performance is magnificent brilliant  perfect. You're beginning to think he IS the Fuehrer his look his  mannerism his sick philosophy of life and his downfall are absolutely convincing. After seeing him you can finally understand why  so many people back then were attracted by his charisma but thanks to  Ganz' performance you do not forget about the terrible crimes he  committed by his followers and about the evil inside the sick soul of  this man. His minions weren't that important in this movie except for  Joseph Goebbels and his family. Heinrich Himmler the ReichsfuehrerSS  was portrayed as the man he was an idiotic coward who was in great  part responsible for the Holocaust and still believed in a peace  agreement with the allied forces although this idea was completely out  of place. Albert Speer as one of the less criminal national socialists  was also quite good interpreted. Martin Bormann Alfred Jodl and  Wilhelm Keitel 3 other important Nazis got too few screen time and  Hermann Goering didn't even show up he was just mentioned. I think  Goebbels wasn't portrayed that authentic as he could have due to the  fact he was the most intelligent of Hitler's inner circle but in some  scenes he seemed like someone who could just repeat his own slogans.  The part about Traudl Junge and the boy from the Volkssturm Peter was  also quite good but it was clearly overshadowed by the Hitler minion  part. There are also some surprisingly well done battle sequences  taking place in Berlin in which you can also see a part of the pretty  high amount of blood and violence for example when a soldier gets shot  through his head some officers are committing suicide or the killing  of the Goebbels children a scene which gave me the chills. Due to it's  high authenticity great actors and an important message this movie  could become as important as Schindler's List already is in order to  show today's youth the insanity of Hitler and the whole Third Rich and  to make them avoid racist and extreme right wing organisations. All in  all this is one of the best German flicks I've ever seen  although  there isn't such a huge number of good German movies. 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "Der Untergang The Downfall portrays life inside and to an extent outside the Fhrerbunker in Berlin during the last few weeks prior to Hitler's suicide in April 1945. The screenplay was written by Bernd Eichinger who has had previous experience with the adaptation of historical material for cinema and done a commendable job in the process. I am of course referring to his screen version of Umberto Ecco's historical novel The Name of the Rose 1986. Some of Eichinger's other credits include Body of Evidence 1993 which he coproduced and The NeverEnding Story 1984 as producer.Few movies have stirred up as much controversy even before their release as has Der Untergang. So what was all the fuss about and was it warranted? After all how many films have been made about Hitler already including several about Hitler in his Berlin bunker. There is nothing especially controversial about the subject matter per se. What is more Hirschbiegel and Eichinger appear to have done their homework basing the film extensively on German historian Joachim Fest's acclaimed book of the same name 2003. Events are portrayed largely through the eyes of Traudl Junge Hitler's private secretary from 1943when the film opens with a flashback sequence to her job interview and appointmentto his death. Her memoirs and interviews conducted before her death constitute a further source for the film. The Fhrer himself is played magisterially by Bruno Ganz who clearly spent countless hours studying Hitler's public speeches as well as rare footage of the private man not to mention recordings of his voice. For a historian like myself who has viewed and listened to much of the material myself it is uncanny how right Ganz gets it. Inflection tonality accentthey are all there. As are gestures and body language. This film has to be seen in the original even if you don't understand German.So if there is little in the way of subject matter preparation historical consulting and prime acting to fault why then the controversy? The approach and interpretation were at the root of the hullabaloo. Interviewed while the film was in the making Eichinger explained that he would portray Hitler as a man as a human wie ein Mensch. This was revolutionary in cinema where renditions of the Nazi leader havepreEichingerstill not gone far beyond the evildictator approach. You might reasonably query what is wrong with the evil dictator approach given the accepted fact that he was indeed evil. From a historian's perspective everything is wrong with that approach and Eichinger had the courage to transcend it for the broad public.The first two decades of postWorld War II historians pretty much demonized Hitler as did all movies before Der Untergang. This was understandable at the time. Wounds were still fresh denazification was under way Germans were seeking a new democratic identity aligned with the West and the issue of collective guilt was touchy. Solid balanced biographies of Hitler had not yet been written and historical understanding of how it was possible that a highly cultured people such as the Germans could have been led astray was only just beginning to take shape. But with the 1964 revision of Lord Alan Bullock's A Study in Tyranny 1st ed. 1952 and Joachim Fest's Hitler Eine Biographie 1973 professional historians started putting demonetization to rest and instead began to explain. And this meant accepting the perhaps distasteful tenet that Hitler was after all a man and not some kind of deranged satanic figure from hell. Sir Ian Kershaw Professor of Modern History at the University of Sheffield has taken things even further in his highly accessible twovolume 2000 page! magnum opus which has now become the standard biography published 19982000. For Kershaw has not only reconciled the internationalist or Hitlercentric approach which focuses on Hitler as linchpin and leader of the Third Reich without whom World War II and the Holocaust are unthinkable with the structuralist approach which links Hitler and his enabling to social political and cultural structures in Weimar Germany. Kershaw has also gone a long way towards meeting the desideratum of German historian Martin Broszat uttered as far back as the 1970s for the historicization of Third Reich history meaning its firm embedding in overall German European and indeed World History rather than its artificial isolation as an aberration or a German special path deutscher Sonderweg. This then is the proper historiographical context of Der Untergang. In effect the film almost belatedly follows trends in scholarship that have been developing for some time now. Of course the general public is hardly aware of such developments. So in a sense the film is something of a vulgarization a kind of dramatization informed by the best scholarship. The film does not explain for it is after all not a documentary with the voiceover of a historical consultant cum narrator. That is not its purpose. What it does however is provide an excellent sense of Hitler in his declining days increasingly delusional if perhaps not outright insane but still ablealmost to the bitter endto maintain a hold on his closest followers. Not to mention the unreality of life in the sheltered bunker while outside the Russians are advancing through Berlin suburbs held back only by a pathetic hodgepodge of Hitler youth and tired old men drafted into service in the Volkswehr. From all accounts I have read from the pens of scholars English American and German I can say with a high degree of certitude that this film provides a reasonably authentic recreation of what it must have been like. Or in the words of Leopold von Ranke wie es eigentlich gewesen. What higher acclaim can a historian provide?".

	schema:headline " A magnificent piece of cinema. Spectacular in every respect";
	schema:reviewBody "Truly great movies are few and far between these days but Der Untergang most definitely represents one of those rare occasions. Oliver Hirschbiegel who brought us the wonderful 'Das Experiment' has produced a film that is very nearly perfect. Depicting the final ten days of Hitler and the National Socialist regime Der Untergang or 'The Downfall' to give it it's English title is an expose of failure and the way that a madman can bend a whole nation into doing his bidding. The film is very realistic and an excellent ensemble cast breathe life and believability into the roles of the various members of the Nazi party and because every performance is picture perfect the whole thing comes together brilliantly as one whole piece. Bruno Ganz gives the central performance as the Fuhrer himself and it is one of the greatest performances I've ever seen in a film. His portrayal of Hitler in the middle of his downfall is absolutely perfect and Ganz excellently portrays the man's every emotion. It must be difficult to play such a notorious character as Hitler himself but Ganz rises to the occasion and gives it his all.It is not the acting or the realism that is Der Untergang's main claim to greatness however  it's the double meaning behind every scene. Each one is perfectly composed and all the time you're watching you can not only see what's happening on screen but also take note of the implications surrounding it. Through every scene there's always the notion that a nation is falling. That's another thing that's great about this movie  the way that it manipulates the audience into an awkward situation. On the one hand we know that Hitler and the Nazi regime were unspeakably evil but while we're watching this almost great nation crumble around it's leader it is hard to watch without feeling some sympathy for the country in spite of the ideals that were preached. I thought it would be impossible to generate feelings for the Nazi's but Der Untergang has managed even that. 'The Downfall' is an apt title for this movie as aside from depicting an important event in history the film is fundamentally about failure. The entire movie focuses on one man's huge downfall and it is both a heartbreaking and powerful cinematic experience. Der Untergang is not to be missed.".

And not only Bruno Ganz has done a great performance the entire cast gives it all their best. Very good film indeed.As I said it's a film about Adolf Hitlers final days trapped in a bunker in Berlin while the Russians are slowly moving closer. Hitler losing his faith in a 'good' outcome the final bullet everything is has happened for real. But when I left the cinema I had the idea I had just been watching a fictional story. A perfect script made in real life 59 years ago. Not much to say about anything else. If you are interested in WWII stuff go see it in the cinema it's worth every penny.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first 15 minutes made me doubt the qualities of this movie. The situations were a bit forced and the cuts were strange. But after the uncomfortable beginning the movie took momentum and kept it until the end.I think the choice of depicting Hitler as a human being with a dispassionate and modest direction was excellent. The film never tries to force viewers into an opinion. Everybody can form his own opinion. Too often the horrors of WWII led writers and directors to depict Nazis as monsters. Perfectly normal human beings can be cruel and merciless if they are blinded by hate for example which should never be forgotten.In a way a human Hitler to me is more guilty than a raving monster. He had the choice and he chose to do wrong. He could choose life and he chose murder and destruction. A human being lost respect for the life of other human beings and led a country into genocide. Ultimately he loses respect for all life and starts sacrificing his own soldiers at random. This is what I value this film for making the idea of a human Hitler tangible.It was very brave to make this film given that controversy was almost certain to arise. One of the highlights of this year to be sure.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have been fascinated not only by the movie I have watched this now 10 times but the divergence of opinion  with some Germans saying it was terrible. This I don't understand. In the West from the time of Charlie Chaplin Hitler was portrayed as a raving lunatic  but to me that does not explain his rise to power. A lunatic could not nearly conquer and enslave half the world. In his early rise to power he was ridiculed in the West. The fact that this movie gives him some human qualities makes him all the more chilling. There is a dialog between the Junge character and the Braun character that perfectly summarizes Hitler. They talked of the great gulf between the private man and the public man. The Braun character said that she had known the man for 15 years  and yet she knew nothing of him. I believe to truly understand the movie one must also watch the movie with the director's commentary. Everything about this movie  with the exception of 2 things mentioned by the director  which having just read the spoiler agreement I will refrain from mentioning  everything was based on fact which makes the movie all the more dramatic. And the movie characters make some minor statements  based on fact  that would be lost on the audience without outside knowledge of those historical facts.Small case in point The Eva Braun character is telling the Traudl Junge character that she so looked forward to coming to Berlin with the inference to me that she hadn't seen Hitler for awhile. Then I read elsewhere that she was in Obersaltzburg for 6 months away from Hitler prior to coming to Berlin. The director stated that he wanted this movie to be treated not only as a drama  but a documentary. He succeeded in both. I suppose this movie is controversial  a local reviewer said it tried to make Hitler sympathetic by giving him some human qualities but as someone else said this makes him all the more evil. It is these human qualities that make him a believable entity  kind to many individuals indifferent and murderous to millions. And with the end he was indifferent to the fate of his own people who were dying for him. Watching this movie made me think that the German people's initial support of Hitler followed a plot from Goethe  that a Mephistopheles  a demon in disguise  promises the recipient all that he wants in return for his soul. This of course is a theme that has subsequently replayed countlessly in western literature since Goethe's Faustus. This movie is based not only on Junge's book and Fest's book but interviews with some of the survivors of the bunker.I would recommend not only the movie but then watch it with commentary from the director a second time. It is all the more haunting when you realize that virtually everything was based on fact during Berlin's last days.Bruno Ganz  as all the cast  turned in an excellent performance. Watching Ganz in this performance was watching Hitler. You will feel as if you too are a witness in the Bunker. The beginning and end statements by the real secretary Traudl Junge make the movie even more powerful. This movie was so moving for me that I have bought Traudl Junge's book Until the Last Hour. In the US on the DVD it is said it was nominated for best foreign picture  if it didn't win it should have.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having a huge interest in both World Wars and all that happened during the time period 19101950 I've seen a lot of movies and read even more books on the subject. Name me a more or less realistic war movie and I've probably seen it so when Der Untergang was first released in Germany I already knew I wanted to watch it as soon as it would be released over here. The commotion that it caused the good critics that it got all made me look forward to the day that I would see it but really nothing could prepare me for what I saw... It was amazing it was great it was jawdropping...The main criticism that many people had on this movie was that Hitler and the other Nazi party members looked too human. I know some people expect that the leaders of the Third Reich are only shown as real monsters as people who didn't have any human feelings... But that's not the truth. The truth is that no matter how horrible the things they did they still were human and most of the time acted like normal human beings for instance Hitler who really loved his German shepherd or who had one of Goebbels' children sitting on his lap while they were singing a song for him.... And let's be honest do you think a leader who doesn't care for his people's destiny after the war who doesn't want to see the truth that the war is lost who knows all too well that he sends young children into battle he even decorates them personally but doesn't care a man who can be so kind and sweet one moment and than be furious and outraged the other moment really looks like a kind sweet grandfather??? I don't think so. The makers of this movie never intended to make him look like a nice or a bad man they intended to show him the way he really was and they did an amazing job.I've seen many documentaries about Hitler and read a lot of books about the man so I think I can say I know quite well how he acted and reacted. Seeing Bruno Ganz as Hitler was a shock. He doesn't just look like Hitler he IS Hitler in this movie!!! His performance was absolutely amazing and seeing him in this film really made shivers going down my spine. Hitler seemed to be alive again! If you've read so many books about the man as I did you can only conclude that the resemblance is more than just remarkable it is perfect.But of course there were more actors in the movie than Bruno Ganz an actor who I admire since I saw Pane e Tulipani or Bread and Tulips for the first time. Even though I have to admit that I don't really know any of them I must say that they all did an excellent job. Juliane Khler as Eva Brown Corinna Harfouch as Magda Goebbels Alexandra Maria Lara as Traudl Junge Ulrich Matthes as Joseph Goebbels... They all must have studied there characters for many hours because they were all excellent.As the horror and reality of the movie have only just ended and burned themselves on your retina for the rest of your life By the end of the movie you'll have seen many officers commit suicide Hitler and Eva Brown being burned behind the bunker the Goebbels murdering their children people being hanged on a lantern for stupid reasons young children dying as they try to defend Berlin... you think you've had it all but than the real Traudl Junge gives away a last testimony looking back on her life with Hitler ... blowing you away even more. I can't remember that I've ever been so quiet after seeing a movie and apparently I wasn't the only one. Really noone spoke a word during the first minutes after the lights went on again. I don't think many movies have ever touched the audience in such a deep way as this one did.Because of its historical value and realism this movie should be seen by everybody and especially by young people at school. Forget those history books for once this will get through to them at least ten times better. I'm sure that everybody will admit that this movie is a true masterpiece. People who don't know anything about the subject will be able to learn a lot about it and people who already thought they knew it all will still find some new things and will admit that this is exactly the way it must have been 60 years ago. I think there can be only one appropriate score for this movie and that is a full 1010. Go see it people NOW!!!".

I can't remember that I've ever been so quiet after seeing a movie and apparently I wasn't the only one. Really noone spoke a word during the first minutes after the lights went on again. I don't think many movies have ever touched the audience in such a deep way as this one did.Because of its historical value and realism this movie should be seen by everybody and especially by young people at school. Forget those history books for once this will get through to them at least ten times better. I'm sure that everybody will admit that this movie is a true masterpiece. People who don't know anything about the subject will be able to learn a lot about it and people who already thought they knew it all will still find some new things and will admit that this is exactly the way it must have been 60 years ago. I think there can be only one appropriate score for this movie and that is a full 1010. Go see it people NOW!!!";

	schema:reviewBody "I had the DVD of this film for my birthday and quite by chance also bought The Name Of The Rose also produced by Bernd Eichinger so I had the experience of watching two movies by this superb producer in two days filmed 20 years apart.To save anyone who doesn't want to read further I have over 200 DVDs in my collection and have no hesitation in placing this as 1.Now for the review I'm not sure it is possible to write a 'spoiler' for historic events not counting the people who came out of Titanic crying because 'the ship sank'??. We know Hitler died we know the Allies won WWII.I came to this movie having read the book The Last Days Of Hitler by Hugh TrevorRoper who was the officer British Intelligence charged with finding out the truth in September 1945. Obviously I was curious to see how Downfall compared.The main difference is in focus. While the book looks from the top leadership down the film looks from the bottom Traudl Junge  a secretary up. The difference in perception is fascinating.Hitler Our first view of him is somehow of a kindly man who stops dictating looks at Traudl and says Let's try again when she fails to keep up with him. The duality of this his private character is incredible and makes one think bipolar or schizophrenia as it seems impossible to believe that the raging monster who says that the German people do not deserve to survive is the same one who orders Junge and Christian to leave the bunker. If in his eyes the German people do not deserve life why does he show concern for them? Is it because among his inner circle they are one of the vanishing number who have never betrayed him?Eva Braun Blind loyalty is the only description I can find for her. Her devotion to Hitler is total even when pleading for the life of Fegelein she bows unquestioningly to his decision.Traudl Junge I can't say more than the lady herself who in the DVD starts and ends the film with her judgment on herself. Her very simple stance paraphrased was Ignorance is no excuse. Youth is no excuse. I could have asked. I didn't want to know.Josef Goebbels Frightening. A true sociopath in every sense of the word. Hitler may have had the 'excuse' of mental illness towards the end but Goebbels' actions were those of a rational thinking man who just did not see anything wrong in his actions. The ranting of a clearly unhinged mind is one thing but save us all from the man who calmly considers his actions and rationalises such atrocities as those explained away by Goebbels.However again like Hitler his portrayal showed a stark duality to his character. One moment singing 'Happy Birthday' to Hitler with his children with a warm smile and sparkling eyes the next telling Traudl Junge very calmly that the German people quite rightly deserved the fate that was being visited on them.Magda Goebbels As with other reviewers here I found her almost the most chilling second only to her husband. How any mother could deliberately and calmly bring about the deaths of her own children is something a rational mind cannot comprehend.Every single performance in the movie was captivating. I was glued to the screen from beginning to end. Bruno Ganz et al were perfect in their roles and brought every person back to life as noted above sometimes to chilling effect. Talking to a friend on the phone about the film he thought I meant that the characters were stereotypical 'nasty Germans' but this is not the case.I've mentioned the duality of the main characters but there were others Prof. Dr. ErnstGnter Schenck Prof. Dr. Werner Haase SSGruppenfhrer Hermann Fegelein to name but a few who showed that not all Germans were rabid Nazis and that those who were were very much in the minority. The Army in particular just wanted to get the war over with the minimum of casualties a wish shared I think by every military commander throughout history.The look of the film was authentic and very atmospheric whether in the cramped bunker apparently built more as an authentic replica than a filmset where the shots were mostly taken hand held as there was no space for a mounted camera to the outdoor shots filmed in St Petersburg. It is rivaled in this respect only by Enemy At The Gates for capturing the full horror and idiocy of war.For true historians of the war  a must see.For all modern history students  a must see.For all who have never lived through war I myself am 36 so I have notLest We Forget.A Must See.".

	schema:headline " Probably the most accurate WW II movie I have ever seen";
	schema:reviewBody "A lot of war movies have a sense of patriotism or commercialism but Der Untergang feels like it is just giving you the cold hard facts of the last ten days of the Third Reich. I have to commend the filmmakers for not using black and white or filtering the color like many other WW II movies today. It is becoming a clich. The film is based on Traudl Junge's recollections of the last ten days she spent in Hitler's Bunker. It takes place entirely in the Bunker which gives the film a very claustrophobic feel. As the outcome of the war becomes clearer the Bunker becomes a cesspool of drunkenness denial and even death.Hitler's secretary Traudl Junge has a strange relationship with him. She stays with him out of sympathy and loyalty but she is often horrified by his cruelty and inhumanity. This might be difficult to understand but I believe this makes the movie all the more realistic. She can recognize cruelty when she sees it but Hitler is the Fuhrer a man who is practically worshiped. Hitler is shown to have elements of humanity. He despises smoking loves his dog Blondi and genuinely seems to care for his secretaries and Dr. Goebbel's children. We can feel his sorrow as the Russians advance toward Berlin. His dream of a German Empire had been lost and it breaks his soul. One of my favorite shots in the film is that of Hitler staring silently at a picture of Frederick the Great seemingly thinking about his failures.This is not to say Der Untergang is pro Nazi. I believe that by portraying Hitler's humanity the film makes his crimes all the more terrible. If he was just a one dimensional monster that would be his excuse. The inhumanity of the Third Reich does emerge throughout the film. Hitler blames the German people for the defeat of the military calling them cowards and saying they deserve their fate. Joseph Goebbels expresses similar sentiments. Magda Goebbels says she cannot live in a world without National Socialism and poisons her children before committing suicide with her husband.The film perfectly captures an aura of hopelessness and denial. Eva Braun throws a party in the middle of the Russian bombing trying to get her mind off Germany's impending defeat. She does anything and everything to keep her mind off the war. Hitler orders his Generals to move Tank divisions that do not exist or are too crippled to be of any use. He blames his Generals for Germany's defeat and not himself which he usually did in real life. People around Hitler are aware that the situation is hopeless and betray him to save their own skin. In the midst of all the madness some people have retained their sanity. Professor Schenck a German Doctor tries to help the wounded soldiers and civilians when his own government abandons them. Berlin is in ruins and people are left to fend for themselves. An old man tries to convince soldiers who are no more than thirteen that there is no point in fighting but to no avail. Eva Braun's brotherinlaw Fegelein tries to convince Braun to leave Berlin but she cannot leave the Fuhrer. We sympathize with these people and they only show how insane the Third Reich was. People commit suicide out of devotion to the Fuhrer. Corinna Harfouch plays a chilling Magda Goebbels the scene where she pleads with Hitler not to kill himself was outstanding. The star of this movie though is Bruno Ganz. His performance as Hitler feels so authentic it is frightening. If I ever had to recommend a movie just to see one performance this would be one of them. Hitler has been played by great actors like Anthony Hopkins and Alec Guinness but Ganz has received the most praise. I will seek out more of Ganz's movies based on this performance. At the end of the film an excerpt from an interview with the real Traudl Junge is shown. She says that at the time of the Nuremberg trials she was shocked by what had happened in the Concentration Camps but did not consider herself responsible. Now she admits that she had no excuse. I would imagine this is how many Germans from her generation feel. I highly recommend Der Untergang to anyone who is interested in The Third Reich or anyone who appreciates good film making.".

It is the most realistic depiction of the situation I had ever seen and I almost felt a tear in my eye. And that is something coming from a 40 year old Army veteran. The last 5 minutes I was on the edge of my seat when the Russians showed up. Anyway this movie is totally recommended by me but brush up on your Nazi history first or you won't know who is who.I also liked it because it showed Hitler as a real human and not the usual Anthony HopkinsAlec Guiness nutbag Hitler or the stereotypical demon Hitler. It showed him as he was a broken down egomaniac. I will totally buy this movie and add it to my collection which is rare for me to do these days.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1945 the second world war is coming to an end The German armies that once spread out all over Europe have been decimated and pushed back to the very heart of the German command in Berlin. Deep in his bunker Hitler continues to rule with his group of generals families and Traudl his secretary. Awaiting armies that no longer exist and making plans that his generals are too scared to tell him are impossible Hitler refuses to surrender as the streets and citizens of Berlin suffer between the remaining defending forces and the advancing Russian army. Gradually as it becomes obvious that all is lost the dream collapses and all that is left is death.A few months ago a fellow user on this site asked me if I thought if Der Untergang was going to get nominated for an Oscar or not I must admit that at the time I had not heard of it but decided to see it if I got the chance. Of course it took me a few weeks to be in the mood for a long war movie that I knew was not going to have a good ending for anyone. When I went to see this film the woman selling me my tickets asked if I knew it was a German film I asked why it mattered and she said that they had had quite a few people leave the screening complaining about the fact it wasn't in English doubtless these people then went into the next available screening of Be Cool or whatever and turned off their hearts and minds and just talked their way through the movie. Anyway enough of my multiplex complaining in fairness I did join a surprisingly full screening of this film and immediately got into it. The focus of the story was the bunker and it is compelling in its portrayal with the cold emotion the cruel sentiments and the utter pointlessness of the whole thing.The characters are not that well developed they were never really people to me but they did enough to fit their roles within this story. That said the whole story is compelling and it didn't matter that I didn't care for the characters as people because they were gripping to watch nonetheless. The film works well to paint the inanity of the whole thing but also cut in moments that are so cold that they almost made me shiver  for example when Hitler is told of the loss of all the young officers he simply replies that is what the young are for. The film does not forget the people above ground and the scenes of destruction of Berlin are impacting  those who say that the civilians deserved it should see this and try to understand what they would have done in the situation I am part of a country that went to war with Iraq by that logic I deserve to have that country retaliate against me even though I opposed the manner in which we did it.The acting is classy even though the characters are quite thin at times. Ganz is a great Hitler and gets it spot on throughout the film however he does well not to dominate the film  his death no spoiler there doesn't stop the film because he was not what the film was all about. Lara is good although a bit too wideeyed to convince her real confessions at the end of the film are a bit too forgiving of her as a person but it does serve as a fair ending to the film. Harfouch and Matthes are cold and effective as the Goebbels' while the rest of the support cast all fit their roles well with a good mix of opinions and approaches across the generals facing Hitler.Overall this is a good film although it is not an easy one to watch. The bunker scenes are cold and compelling even if the characters are broad historical reference points rather than people meanwhile the attacks on Berlin are brutal and difficult to just watch without being moved. The manner in which the film ends is just as you'd expect with nothing achieved but destruction by all of German's years before and during the war. The end credits remind us that 50 million people died during the war including 6 million Jews and ethnic minorities systematically murdered  having seen the men who organised all this taking their own lives the main thing I felt was just how pointless and wasteful the whole thing had been and I left the film having enjoyed the quality film but being utterly depressed by the world in which we live.".

	schema:headline " Important for our understanding of How It All Could Happen";
	schema:reviewBody "This is an important film and absolutely a must for anyone who has ever pondered how WWII the Holocaust and all that was at all possible.Der Untergang has sometimes been criticized for making Hitler and the Nazis look sympathetic and human. I saw it like this the most horrifying thing about Hitler and Nazis is that they WERE humans not some caricature monsters of hell. The movie displays this very well without sympathizing or underlining the evil of these human beings.If you're a human being equipped with normal feelings you ARE right in feeling slightly compassionate towards a crying Hitler. But at the same time if you're a normal person your compassion vanishes when you remember why he's crying. He's not regretting his inhuman deeds. He's not feeling remorse for the suffering of other people. He's crying because his horrible plans have failed because he thinks the German people have failed him.I also think Der Untergang points out an important thing about the Nazi ideology. It was and is evil because it is based on intense hate and the conscious rejection of compassion. People blinded by this kind of ideology are also blinded by hatred and as we know this phenomenon is unfortunately alive and well in today's world in the East and the West as well. Movies like Der Untergang give us an important lesson in understanding this dangerous way of thought and the utter madness and vanity of war. Go see this if you can.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is an important film and absolutely a must for anyone who has ever pondered how WWII the Holocaust and all that was at all possible.Der Untergang has sometimes been criticized for making Hitler and the Nazis look sympathetic and human. I saw it like this the most horrifying thing about Hitler and Nazis is that they WERE humans not some caricature monsters of hell. The movie displays this very well without sympathizing or underlining the evil of these human beings.If you're a human being equipped with normal feelings you ARE right in feeling slightly compassionate towards a crying Hitler. But at the same time if you're a normal person your compassion vanishes when you remember why he's crying. He's not regretting his inhuman deeds. He's not feeling remorse for the suffering of other people. He's crying because his horrible plans have failed because he thinks the German people have failed him.I also think Der Untergang points out an important thing about the Nazi ideology. It was and is evil because it is based on intense hate and the conscious rejection of compassion.

	schema:reviewBody "I tuned in late to this film not expected very much because we have all I suppose seen so many documentaries of Hitler's last days in the bunker and a reconstruction with Alec Guiness thrown in for good measure. Many of these presentations depend on interviews with Trudl Junge Hitler's secretary at the time. Her descriptions of the goings on during the final days are cool precise and dispassionate. First Hitler said this then Eva Braun said that and then they went up into the garden. A human surveillance camera who seems to have no personal mechanism for judgments.She was however quite human after all. The last shot of the film is from an interview with her before her death in 2002. She explains to us that young as she was she had always put aside any feeling of guilt for her involvement in the Third Reich negligible as it was. But then one day she passed a monument to Sophie Scholl who sacrificed herself in the course of resisting Naziism and Frau Junge tells the camera  and the rest of the world  that she realized at that moment that youth and naivet could no longer serve as her excuse.I missed the first half hour or so but I stayed for the rest. This is an extremely powerful movie. The events in the bunker are keenly observed. There is virtually nothing in the way of sentiment or dramatic displays. If the director Hirschbiegel wants two officers to commit suicide he may have them walk into a room and close the door behind them then allow us to hear two shots a bit later.No one talks about despair. Instead the officers and some of the ladies sit around a table in one of the bunker's rooms and get drunk as skunks.This is a tragic ending to an insane war and it is all enacted by human beings not demons. Goebbels and his wife have 5 beautiful young children a boy and four girls. They deliberately give them knockout drops then Frau Goebbels puts a capsule of fastacting poison in each of their mouths one after another and crunches the capsule by pressing each child's teeth together. Then wordlessly Goebbels and his wife walk up into the open where still wordlessly he shoots her and then himself  off camera. The soldiers who have been waiting impatiently for this ritual to end then scurry forward with cans of gasoline to dispose of the bodies.The episode is impossible to watch without being moved. What have Goebbels and his wife died for? What did their children who knew nothing of war or racism die for? And implicitly the film asks what did some 50 million people die for between 1939 and 1945? I am grateful to the director and the actors for keeping things so matter of fact. Preparations for a predictable death are pretty gruesome even with the most tasteful intentions and too often executions and suicides seem to have the filmmakers' attention lavished on them for not much reason other than to pander to a morbid interest in watching someone else die a kind of arousal jag.How easy it would have been for a trashy sensibility to give us the death of Hitler's German shepherd Blondi in all its horror. A DOG yet! Those of us who might have cheered at Hitler's death would now have a chance to weep over Blondi's. Instead except for a few instructive inserts Blondi's poisoning is only glimpsed in a clumsy shot through an open doorway.Congratulations to everyone involved in this production. They've given us a wellexecuted film made for adults. They come along so rarely.".

Now that I've watched CASTLE KEEP for myself all I can say is that it's arguably the strangest mainstream war movie ever and decidedly not for all tastes!The relatively large cast for what turns out to be an introspective film is uniformly excellent and is well up to the requirements of the brilliantly surreal funny and literate script Burt Lancaster wearing an eyepatch throughout has an unsympathetic role as the formidable leader of a group of misfit soldiers taking over a Belgian castle against unseen invading German troops. He is skillfully abetted by Peter Falk as a soldier who abandons his post to indulge in his vocation as a baker JeanPierre Aumont as the degenerate owner of the titular castle Patrick O'Neal as a celebrated art historian all at sea on the battleground but well in his element surrounded by the castle's objets d' art Scott Wilson as a soldier who gets into quite a unique relationship  more on this later Tony Bill as the most spiritual of the men and the other side of the coin Bruce Dern as a Biblethumping conscientious objector who walks the Belgian rubbles with his ragged band of revivalist desertersfollowers.

The theme of the relevance of art in times of war brings forth comparisons to John Frankenheimer's THE TRAIN 1964 also starring Burt Lancaster whose third and final collaboration with director Sydney Pollack  after the previous year's THE SCALPHUNTERS and THE SWIMMER where Pollack replaced original director Frank Perry but goes uncredited  this proved to beperhaps as a result of the critical beating the film received upon its original release!".

Cinematographer Henri Decae The 400 Blows creates a surreal fairytale atmosphere without sacrificing wartime realism in this tale of stranded GIs in the Ardennes at the end of World War II. The squad led by an eyepatched Burt Lancaster try to halt the German advance by hunkering down in a medieval castle that has been miraculously unaffected by the tribulations of the war.

	schema:reviewBody "Clearly Academy Award winning actor Burt Lancaster must have gotten along well with director Sidney Pollack because they made two films together The Scalphunters 1968 and Castle Keep 1969 and Pollack contributed in the one in between The Swimmer that Lancaster appeared in for director Frank Perry. A oneeyed U.S. Army commander Major Abraham Falconer Burt Lancaster of Elmer Gantry leads a squad of eight soldiers consisting of three officers two sergeants and three enlisted men soldiers into the Ardennes Forrest in 1944. They billet themselves in a breathtaking 10th century castle in Belgium on the eve of the historic Battle of the Bulge. The dry humor comes through the dialogue that cleverly undercuts each situation or predicament that our protagonists encounter. If fantastic photography guaranteed that a movie would be artistically great Night of the Generals lenser Henri Deca would make this the rule rather than the exception. His widescreen cinematography is a consistent treat for the eyes and the pictorial compositions are wellbalanced and imaginative.Director Sidney Pollack and scenarists Daniel Taradash of From Here to Eternity1953 and David Rayfiel of Valdez Is Coming 1971 adapted the novel by David Eastlake. Castle Keep emerges as a surrealistic World War II action epic. Major Falconer and his men defending the castle against an onslaught of German troops and armor. During the first half of this 106minute movie castle owner Count of Maldorais JeanPierre Aumont of The Siren of Atlantis welcomes Major Falconer Captain Beckman Patrick O'Neal of El Condor Lieutenant Amberjack Tony Bill of Ice Station Zebra Sergeant Rossi Peter Falk of Anzio Sergeant DaVaca Michael Conrad of Sol Madrid Corporal Clearboy Scott Wilson of In Cold Blood Private Allistair Piersall Benjamin Al Freeman Jr. of The Lost Man and Elk James Patterson of Lilith to the castle and hope that they will defend it from the enemy. Principally Maldorais wants them to save his works of art and hopes that the virile Major will get his classically gorgeous wife Therese Astrid Heeren of Silent Night Deadly Night pregnant because the count is impotent and needs a male heir.After the Americans settle inFalconer warms up the master bedroom with Therese the soldiers head into town to the Red Queen brothel while Rossi befriends the widow of a baker Olga Bisera of Women in Cell Block 7 and starts baking bread. Captain Beckman gives lectures about the artworks in the castle. Notsurprisingly Beckman was one an art historian. Falconer shows up in town and shows the prostitutes how to design Molotov cocktails and then throw them at German tanks when they enter town. The funniest scene involves Corporal Clearboy and the Volkswagen beetle that he finds on the premises. Late one night two G.I.s set out to destroy the VW bug by pushing it into the moat. The bug floats so they shoot at it below the waterline to sink it. Corporal Clearboy awakens to the sounds of gunshots and scrambles for the stairs. A fellow soldier tells him to take the shortcut through another door. Clearboy opens the door and spaces on air. The door opens on the moat and the G.I. plunges into the moat but he swims to the VW cranks it up and drives it up onto dry land. The second half concerns the castle defense and a brief but explosive battle with tanks blasting away at the architecture as well as the Americans concealed behind it.Despite its pretentious cool attitude toward warfare Castle Keep qualifies as a traditional war movie but it is far from conventional. The action boils down to a desperate siege with no hope in sight for relief. Indeed some of the best World War II era films dealt with gallant last stands such as Wake Island Bataan and China. The Germans constitute a faceless enemy. Pollack keeps them at arm's length so we have no reason to hate them. The Americans are a crosssection of the United States and they are basically good guys who like to loaf when they get a caught. Major Falconer is a straightup guy who does not lord it over his men. Nevertheless despite its handsome production values splendid photography this World War II movie rarely generates any suspense because it the Americans are not portrayed in a sympathetic light and everything seems arbitrary. The performances are all good. Lancaster delivers a tightlipped nononsense performance as the disciplined commander with a purposeful manner. Pollack invests very little sentiment when the characters die. None of the Americans receive historic treatment. The sight of the castle burning is hypnotic. One of the most iconic character actors of the 1960 thru the 1980 perennial villain Bruce Dern turns up as a raggedly deserter who leads a religious sect. You can tell that Castle Keep is an antiwar movie because it refuses to glorify warfare. The problem with Castle Keep is that it doesn't have enough sarcasm to be a satire and it lacks exuberance in its combat sequences to be a warmongering classic. Interestingly Castle Keep fails to measure up to its ownor perhaps Beckman'sdefinition of good art. According to Beckman great art but disturb and awaken its audience. Sadly Castle Keep neither disturbs us enough nor awakens us.".

	onyx:emotionText "Clearly Academy Award winning actor Burt Lancaster must have gotten along well with director Sidney Pollack because they made two films together The Scalphunters 1968 and Castle Keep 1969 and Pollack contributed in the one in between The Swimmer that Lancaster appeared in for director Frank Perry. A oneeyed U.S. Army commander Major Abraham Falconer Burt Lancaster of Elmer Gantry leads a squad of eight soldiers consisting of three officers two sergeants and three enlisted men soldiers into the Ardennes Forrest in 1944. They billet themselves in a breathtaking 10th century castle in Belgium on the eve of the historic Battle of the Bulge. The dry humor comes through the dialogue that cleverly undercuts each situation or predicament that our protagonists encounter. If fantastic photography guaranteed that a movie would be artistically great Night of the Generals lenser Henri Deca would make this the rule rather than the exception. His widescreen cinematography is a consistent treat for the eyes and the pictorial compositions are wellbalanced and imaginative.Director Sidney Pollack and scenarists Daniel Taradash of From Here to Eternity1953 and David Rayfiel of Valdez Is Coming 1971 adapted the novel by David Eastlake. Castle Keep emerges as a surrealistic World War II action epic. Major Falconer and his men defending the castle against an onslaught of German troops and armor.

As for me I am a retired history teacher and it just made me irritated as the terminally stupid might just think this film is a documentary and people really talked and acted like this! The film is nominally about a group of American soldiers who are making a stand at a Belgian castlewaiting for the inevitable attack from the Germans around the time of the Battle of the Bulge December 1944. However as they are waiting for this throughout most of the film you see LOTS of little scenarios that seem very randomand have little if anything to do with the WWII era. There's the wife of the castle who sleeps with various men because her husband is impotent and he wants a son there's an art historian! who gives lectures to men who have zero interestbut who LOVE to hang out at a brothel filled with 1960sstyle prostitutes a guy who is in love with a VW and predicts it's the car of the future a guy who wants to do nothing but bakeso he hangs out in town and bakes bread a group of religious freaks who are pretty much guaranteed to offend and folks talking about the meaning of life. It's all a lot of stupid nonsense if you ask meespecially since folks often dress and act like folks from the hippie 1960s especially the ladies and the music is very appropriate for a counterculture 1960s filmthought this is supposed to be 1945! Some folks might think this is all cleverI think it's just dumband rather boring. The film only heats up near the end when the fighting starts but that isn't enough and the film seems like a waste of some talented actors. Well worth skipping.".

Like Fuller's film this is simply war as it was fought  garnished for dramatic and comic effect with more than a touch of the undeniably surreal. But as Fuller made plain in his wholly realistic film war creates just the sort of environment where the surreal happens.BTW what made this a cult film in the first place is not any 'antiwar' message the message is actually more 'antiEuropean' if you follow the dialog closely but rather its remarkable comedic sense of the absurd made most famous by the affair with the Volkswagen but actually more impressive with Falk's baker who moves in with the Belgian town's baker's wife because well that's what bakers do they live with baker's wives.All this adds up to a stunning even shocking film that is still highly entertaining. I suspect those that find it confusing haven't lived much life yet or don't want to. This film is not dated in the least it will survive all the CGI crap that Hollywood vomits up as long as there are people who want to think and to feel while watching a film.".

Waiting for this possible strike they go about amusing themselves by relaxing or taking in the sights. The Major is bedding the Counts wife Captain Beckman studying and admiring the count's artwork Sergeant Rossi living his dream of having wife child and baking. Private Benjamin storming up ideas of a possible novel while Corporal Clearboy falls head over heels for a Volkswagen. But their lifestyles are shattered when finally the Germans advanced through the forest and upon the castle.You want a very offbeat and ambitious war drama look no further then Sidney Pollacks' dreamlike majestic oddity Castle Keep. However it tends to be one of those cult films you'll love or be totally put off by its artsy approach. I'm the former. I was totally spellbound by its quirky bleak and theatrical sense of style interwoven within its lyrically verbose script and moody selfconscious characters. Adapted from William Eastlake's novel this is pretty much a calm conversational piece that likes to philosophically reflect on itself with a haunting and decisive charge before it changes pace and somewhat direction to actually lead up to a loud chaotic brutal and taut action climax in the dying stages of the film.Pollacks' smooth n' breezy execution leads the way to a slow plodding pace where it's a clash of personalities and a lot little trivia set in motion. War is pointless and simply made up of absurdity and that's how Daniel Taradash and David Rayfiel's thoughtfully satiric screenplay lets the story unfold because honestly it treads water and doesn't sway far from its base work. Seeping off it are random unexpected subplots like fairytale strokes with Private Benjamin's crisp narration which it's his story were watching seem to have a metaphysical current. The rich humour within is uniquely pulledoff by holding an uncanny absurd and odd feel. Beautifully crafted and ultrastylish with many bold and surreal flourishes. One of those few includes the sequence in the rose garden and the wonderfully amusing setup of the Volkswagen. It was like looking at a painting just admiring the art in front of you. Then move onto the next frame for another poetic image. But the life is sapped out of it with more so a deadpan quality making its way into Pollacks' slick direction.Henri Decae's fluidly illustrative cinematography was pictureperfect with atmospheric lighting and Michel Legrand's harmoniously spiralling and intrusively baroque music score only adds to its disorienting makeup and cooks up a tuneful awe. Streaming through it was a bold psychedelic edge due to the times. The beautifully lush backdrop of the wilderness and grand appearance of the extravagant castle are vibrantly captured to provide another hypnotic dimension to the welllooking production. The performances are astounding. Burt Lancaster's stoically dominating portrayal with a smart slight tongue is excellently delivered and Peter Falk's nononsense grounded to reality performance is superb as the baker at heart Sergeant Rossi. Don't you just love the smell of fresh bread. Patrick O'Neal is credibly solid as the toey artloving Captain Beckham and JeanPierre Aumont as the sly Count of Maldorais. Astrid Heeren is seductively silky as the count's wifeniece Therese. The rest of the support Scott Wilson Tony Bill James Patterson Al Freeman Jr. and Michael Conrad were exceptionally good. Also Bruce Dern is a delight to watch as the fruity preaching American deserter who has taken up on god's side as he tries to convince others to do so.Uneven but still a oneofakind experience. Almost just like a dream.".

	schema:reviewBody "Thanks to this film I can never entirely think of Private Benjamin as a comedy about a society girl in the army not that this one doesn't have a lot of funny moments of the very strange kind. Hessian is right  it's so strange you almost have to either love or hate it and I'm completely attached to it. With the kinds of actors in it it's really hard to think of anyone as especially standing out but as attached as I've always been to Burt Lancaster the answer would almost have to be Patrick O'Neal as Beckman. It took me a long while to think of it but he's almost like the Eleanor character in The Haunting because of the way he's taken over by the castle completely and his private war with the major because of it. One of the best scenes was between him and Private Benjamin played by Al Freeman Jr. who was pictured as his soulmate in a way.

Hessian is right  it's so strange you almost have to either love or hate it and I'm completely attached to it. With the kinds of actors in it it's really hard to think of anyone as especially standing out but as attached as I've always been to Burt Lancaster the answer would almost have to be Patrick O'Neal as Beckman. It took me a long while to think of it but he's almost like the Eleanor character in The Haunting because of the way he's taken over by the castle completely and his private war with the major because of it. One of the best scenes was between him and Private Benjamin played by Al Freeman Jr. who was pictured as his soulmate in a way. Beckman admitted that he'd been a war hero before the beginning of the story but he wrote it off as being temporarily crazy. Benjamin said But you'd fight to save this castle.

I think the underlying theme may have been the pointlessness or insanity of war but even that was done so poorly I wonder. This was more a slapdash of scenes that could have been parts of a better movie. As the movie ended I was left thinking What a waste on multiple levels. The story was pointless never went anywhere.

It tries to be artsy similar to Thin Red Line only it doesn't work. Was the director on drugs? Burt Lancaster is a Major with an eye patch in the U.S. army commanding a squad of men charged with protecting a medieval castle. Sounds good so far right? That's what I thought. Well his men don't even fire their guns till the very end. Ol' Burt is more concerned with having sex than fighting Nazis. Peter Falk costars as a soldier more concerned with baking bread. Seriously he's a baker and more importantly he's not funny in this role. This is no action movie. This is a madeforTV quality movie at best. I'm not a fan of most 70's war movies and even though this was made in 1969 its close enough. 1.5 out of 5 action rating".

This movie is the best antidote for those Chuck Norristype of movies Burt Lancaster is brilliant as the straightarrow Maj. Falconer stubbornly insisting on holding back the German advance. Like all stoneheaded commander he insists that he is right on everything even when he is not. Patrick O'Neal as Beckman who sees himself as a civilized person tries his best to infuse the men with some culture and steer his CO to a more civilized course of action but of course good ol' Falconer insist on seeing things in black and white. The rest of the men war weary to the bone fall back to fighting their own private wars to paraphrase Falconer. For example Peter Falk plays Rossi the bakersoldier obsessed with bread baking it eating it having wine to eat with it sleeping with the baker's wife etc. Wilson plays the soldier who falls in love with an ahem Another soldier played by Tony Bill focuses on his music helped by none other by a German who of course was shot to death by a fellow G.I. And who can forget Bruce Dern in his best loony role yet. The Count and his young wife provided the foundation for all this nonstandard war time atmosphere. The battle scenes are also excellent. Watching them you wouldn't think that this is a thinking film and not just some brainless action movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "If a bunch of hippies teamed up with Federico Fellini to make a WW2 film after attending an anti Vietnam war rally it would probably look something like director Sydney Pollack's Castle Keep.Psychedelic surreal and zany Castle Keep opens with a series of dreamy shots. Stepping into focus is Major Falconer a gungho military man in charge of a small company of men. Recognising that the German Army is advancing toward a nearby town Falconer decides to turn a medieval castle into his own private fortress the Germans will have to destroy it and him if they wish to advance any further.Fittingly for a film released in 1969 amidst the social turmoils of thencontemporary United States Falconer's men are a gang of Vietnamera slackers shirts untucked jaded cynical and tired of killing. Falconer infectiously played by Burt Lancaster is the opposite. Squarejawed and mean as hell Falconer exists for war.Keep's second half revolves around a series of bizarre philosophical ruminations. Falconer says he wants to preserve life land people and things but everything he does brings about utter destruction. In the end killing the enemy for Falconer necessitates destroying even the things he's sworn to protect. Better the world on fire than belonging to the enemy. Art aficionado Captain Beckman Patrick O'Neal argues with Falconer pleading with him to preserve the beauty of the castle and its many artifacts but Falconer ignores him. Destruction for Falconer is its own brand of beauty.Late in the film it is revealed that Falconer is sleeping with the wife Astrid Heeren of the Count JeanPierre Aumont to whom the castle belongs. The Count allows this as he is impotent and wishes Falconer to provide him with an heir. In this way Falconer's brand of 20st century violence is explicitly linked to the violence of feudal Europe. Indeed Falconer a footsoldier of enlightened democratic nations simply preserves the barbaric seeds of the monarchists before him. WW2 was itself but an extension of 19th century Imperialism even a bogeyman like Hitler merely replicating what European and Western colonialists had were and still are doing in America Africa Asia and Oceania. More importantly Falconer's cosying up to aristocracy echoes the past 200 years of history in which every supposed enlightened superpower has sided with funded armed or put in power monarchs dictators or terrorist cells from Vietnam to Russia Saudi Arabia to Iraq better devils than peace.Falconer's regressive ties with the past are brought up throughout the film. We've been here before soldiers repeatedly state and the idea of eternal recurrence is a theme which runs throughout their escapades. Elsewhere there are suggestions that our band of heroes are already dead that their castle exits in some kind of limbo or purgatory and that they're merely repeating battles that have already been fought and lost. All of us had been killed twice sometimes three times before one Private Benjamin outright states maybe that's why we were at the castle.Other surreal moments occur. Sgt Rossi Peter Falk states that he was a baker before he enlisted. His homecoming fantasies are realised when he seduces the widow of a local bakery. Corporal Clearboy a mechanic in the past likewise falls in love with a Volkswagen Beetle  an illicit affair as it's a German machine. These love affairs mirror that of Private Amberjack a soldier who studied music as a kid. Amberjack finds a flute which allows him to befriend a German soldier. Then there's Captain Beckman a famous art historian who just happens to find himself in a castle containing precious works of fine art. As the film progresses the bakery artwork German flute and Volkswagen will all be destroyed. The only one who gets what he loves seems to be Falconer.Castle Keep echoes the countercultureinflected war films of the 1960s and 1970s Catch22 Kelly's Heroes Go Tell the Spartans MASH Dirty Dozen etc. For Pollock war is stupid absurd futile and benefits only psychopaths. But whilst Pollock embraces the cynicism of his contemporaries aesthetically his film is something else. Opening with talk of fairy tales and sporting its own once upon a time narrator Pollock constructs something dreamy surreal and filled with odd incongruous moments. His soldiers seem caught out of time as though they've stepped right out of a Sam Fuller movie and into a medieval fantasy. Shot in Yugoslavia the film features fine photography by Henri Decae.7.910  Flawed but underrated. From the mid 1950s to the 1980s Lancaster specialised in selecting interesting material. The majority of his pictures during this period are atypical of their genre or era.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are some moments in this war drama that can be constituted as classic. A discussion with soldiers over changing sexual ethics a conversation between an American soldier playing the flute and a hidden German soldiers who offers to make it sound better. The crossing of paths with locales near the Belgian castle nearing its 1000th birthday. Pretty scenery interesting individual characters and some entertaining and often ironic situations. Oh and virtually plot less.Burt Lancaster headlines as the one eyed commanding officer getting a historical viewpoint of the history as he plans how to get his troop out of there. Peter Falk delivers the typical cynical acidic performance taking the issue of the German flutist into his own hands. I'm a soldier. That's what we do. he says following the analogy of the frog and the scorpion. Rarely in films about American soldiers do you see one where a character is as amoral and cold hearted as this one. Well not until Tom Berenger in Platoon that is. The film hits its height nearing the end with an air attack that is quite brutal.When the plot does finally kick in essentially their story of survival and keeping the Germans from taking over the castle you are engrossed with what's happening so it's easy to be inclined to think that it's a better film than it is. Going into Boris Karloff territory by basically playing exactly the same character that Karloff did in The Last Patrol Bruce Dern goes way over the top.

	onyx:emotionText "There are some moments in this war drama that can be constituted as classic. A discussion with soldiers over changing sexual ethics a conversation between an American soldier playing the flute and a hidden German soldiers who offers to make it sound better. The crossing of paths with locales near the Belgian castle nearing its 1000th birthday. Pretty scenery interesting individual characters and some entertaining and often ironic situations. Oh and virtually plot less.Burt Lancaster headlines as the one eyed commanding officer getting a historical viewpoint of the history as he plans how to get his troop out of there. Peter Falk delivers the typical cynical acidic performance taking the issue of the German flutist into his own hands. I'm a soldier. That's what we do. he says following the analogy of the frog and the scorpion. Rarely in films about American soldiers do you see one where a character is as amoral and cold hearted as this one. Well not until Tom Berenger in Platoon that is. The film hits its height nearing the end with an air attack that is quite brutal.When the plot does finally kick in essentially their story of survival and keeping the Germans from taking over the castle you are engrossed with what's happening so it's easy to be inclined to think that it's a better film than it is. Going into Boris Karloff territory by basically playing exactly the same character that Karloff did in The Last Patrol Bruce Dern goes way over the top. Jean Pierre Aumont plays the list idealistic of the men trapped in the castle but the least defined. This movie is just one variation of the reminder of how far the second world war reached and instills the theory that we can't afford another one as it could be our last.";

	schema:reviewBody "Two World War II flicks involving a European castle came out in 1968 Where Eagles Dare and Castle Keep. If you're a fan of war films you've no doubt heard of Where Eagles Dare which is one of the greatest war actionadventure films ever made but I wouldn't be too surprised if you've never heard of Castle Keep or only vaguely heard of it. There's good reason for this.THE PLOT The Germans are marching on a Belgium village in the Ardennes where a small group of American soldiers make a stand at a 10th century castle.Castle Keep has a lot going for it a great cast including Burt Lancaster Peter Falk Bruce Dern  many more fabulous Yugoslavian Winter locations  castle thrilling action scenes it's wellmade on a technical level and it hardly comes across dated at all even though it's forty years old. Fans of the film describe it as poetic  haunting and it's certainly obvious the filmmakers were shooting for something groundbreaking meaningful and artistic.Unfortunately Castle Keep failed to grab my attention until well into the second half of its 1 hour  45 minute runtime which is when the great action scenes start. The characters have a lot of dialogue but you never get to know them or care about them. Maybe because the chatter comes off as unreal artsy and inscrutable. Want a sample? The Count of the castle comments to Theresa who is his wife I think They planned this war because there was something they hadn't yet smashed. She replies Who are we Henri? We are the keepers. The script is full of such deep nonsense. Which I suppose would be okay as long as the story itself pulled me in but it didn't. The story doesn't perk up and grab the viewer's attention until the Germans march on the village well past the hour mark.Want another example of the film's unreal vibe? The soldiers go into town to kill time at the local whore house. When they enter all the prostitutes are standing or lying around in various tantalizing poses in lingerie. I'm sure they were just hanging around like that waiting for five soldiers to walk in  WHY SURE! You gotta see it to believe it. I busted out laughing! One reviewer offered the interpretation that one soldier the writer is simply remembering how it was not how it really was and that's why it comes across so dreamlike bizarre and unreal. I find this a valid explanation. Others point out that it's an allegory about the futility of the Vietnam War which was going on at the time of release. Another interpretation is that the message is one of contrast Life from death and death where once life was Huh?.Hey I'm all for message films with deeper meanings that is as long as the film itself is interesting the original Apocalypse Now is a good example. The greatest sin in filmmaking is to be boring. The second is to be pretentious. Unfortunately Castle Keep commits both of these transgressions IMHO.BOTTOM LINE Castle Keep is an avantgarde film palatable to a chosen few. It's either groundbreaking or pretentious depending on your tastes. I certainly respect it and enjoy numerous aspects noted above but personally deem it a failure. Still I'm an openminded person. Maybe next time I'll get it. If my words intrigue you check it out. I strangely found it worth viewing and owning even though I currently don't like it. I can't figure it out but then again I can't figure the film out either.GRADE D".

	schema:reviewBody "During World War II a small squad of 8 American soldiers led by Major Abraham Falconer Burt Lancaster relocate to a castle in Belguim. They rest there for awhile but then find themselves in the direct path of the advancing German army during the famous counteroffensive known as the Battle of the Bulge. Rather than retreat and rejoin the main American army Major Falconer decides to make a stand with his few men within the castle. Now obviously the entire idea is ridiculous. But the director Sydney Pollack was trying to make a point about the insanity of war. The end result is a film that tries to be artistic and stylish for its time but in my opinion goes beyond the realm of believability. I say that because some of the scenarios are too farfetched to be believed. For example at one point a handful of prostitutes totally destroy a German tank with a few small Molotov cocktails. If that doesn't strain reality to the breaking point then another scenario a few minutes later features two American soldiers completely capturing another tank by firing a bazooka at it. Nevermind that a bazooka round would simply bounce off of the tank. Apparently the message was too important to be bothered by any sense of realism. Unfortunately it gets even crazier when they decide to defend the castle. Only in Hollywood. Be that as it may Burt Lancaster put on a decent performance and Astrid Heeren as Therese was absolutely gorgeous. But other than that I found it difficult to get past the absurdity of it all.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a highly symbolic artsy portrayal of American GIs in the Ardennes Forest Belgium preparing to sacrifice themselves as so many did in a last stand to stop Hitler's December 1944 counteroffensive. They are an exhausted ragtag bunch of stragglers piled onto a wheezing jeep and its trailer led with singleminded determination by Burt Lancaster's Major Falconer.They encounter an unexpected  imaginary?  castle at a strategic crossroads and settle in. The count and his castle have survived German occupation and he does not want his world destroyed by GIs turning it into a modern war roadblock. His ally is Patrick Neal's Captain Beckman who happens to be an authority on art and pleads with Falconer to continue their retreat so the castle and its art treasures can be spared.On the other hand the scheming count wants his beautiful young wife impregnated for an heir and the predominating Major Falconer takes diversion from his unit and the war to do that duty while killing a young German officer who had tried to return to see her. The girl feels used and falls in love with the hardened Falconer turning against the count.Here I might mention a couple of historical precedents for this. We Americans bombed into rubble the abbey of Monte Cassino with its library treasures in Italy in 1944 although the Germans had said they were not occupying or using the abbey for military purposes. After the war it was easy to question the bombing but to the troops on the ground there was no question the abbey should have been bombed.In the Battle of the Bulge  the Ardennes  the Waffen SS panzer divisions in the north soon met stubborn insuperable resistance after they had massacred a hundred American GIs at Malmedy. In the center the regular Wehrmacht panzer divisions made greater penetration thanks to more intelligent attacking. Leading the advance was General Eisenarsch IronAss Bayerlein's Panzer Lehr division.Bayerlein's friend and mentor in North Africa had been The Desert Fox General Ervin Johann Rommel who had a few months before been forced by Hitler to commit suicide for supporting to whatever degree the attempt to assassinate Hitler in July 1944.Our forces were confused and dispirited and falling back in the face of the overwhelming German attack. Bayerlein had the strategic crossroads of Bastogne within easy grasp but along toward evening encountered a U.S. Army field hospital wherein he encountered a breathtakingly beautiful blonde American nurse. She gave him the nod and he said to hell with Hitler and the war and spent the night with her. After the war she settled in the Wash DC area and I had it on good authority from an Army historian that she retained her striking beauty all her life. And all through that night we were rushing reinforcements like the 101st Airborne Division into Bastogne to hold it against all attacks even when surrounded mortally crippling 5th Panzerarmee's offensive.Knowing the above helps to understand the significance of some of the dialog in the film.While the film may seem antiwar there was obviously no question in JewishAmerican Sidney Pollack's mind that Falconer's battle  and the war against the Nazis itself  had to be fought even if some European cultural treasures had to be sacrificed in the process. In his Wikipedia biography Bergman's The Seventh Seal is listed as one of the films Pollack most admired and Castle Keep's dialogs before the reckoning are similar.Note that each of the GIs is described along with his own values and goals  even if those are just getting drunk and laid in the Red Queen.There is also the sense of virile Americans coming to the rescue of Europa incarnated by the countess. The film is in some ways pretentious and cynical but it strives to show the real heroism of the Ardennes reverently nonetheless.And I agree that the battle scenes ... of the castle being stormed to nihilistic destruction by the Germans' modern weapons ... are very intense and well done ... if ultimately grim.It does remind me of 2 of the Combat! TV series the chteau program with Joan Hackett as the count's daughter and the demolition  of all the beautiful statuary in the cave under the bombed out chteau and German observation point  program with Charles Bronson.Finally Private Benjamin represents what Pollack may have thought was the most relevant and valuable art chronicling the castle's last epic and his and the countess's fate  dictated by Major Falconer  is the true climax and message of the film.Lou Coatney".

	schema:reviewBody "Among the many exciting roles which Burt Lancaster choose this is certainly among his most convincing. Set during the time of The famous Battle of the Bulge this war film will stand the test of time and become part of Lancaster's greats. The story concerns a war weary company of U.S. soldiers who have been ordered to hold a particular crossroads near a 10th century pristine Castle. There the leader of the Americans is a battle hard well seasoned commander called Major Falconer. Burt Lancaster. With a collection of seasoned veterans his men wait stoically within the impressive Medieval Castle against what is sure to be a massive armored offensive by the German army. Nevertheless orders are to prevent the Germans from occupying the strategic position. Lancaster is superb performing a part he was born to play. Within the ancient Castle is the Count of Maldorais Jean Aumont and his wife Astrid Heeren who hope to survive the war and reestablish their ancestral line. Among Falconer's men is a writer Al Freeman historian Lionel Beckman Patrick O'Neal and a Baker Peter Falk named Rossi. Though the heart of the movie concerns the holding of the Castle the story also delves into the personal thoughts and feelings of the Major's men. The soldiers like the actors who portray them is what makes this excellent story a Classic. These include Bruce Dern Scott Wilson Tony Bill and James Patterson. The amount of drama and exciting war time action is enough for any viewer who enjoys films of military conflicts. The inner story between the principals and their objectives make for thoughtful perspectives between desperate people their dreams and the reality of senseless destruction. All in all this is one movie which is pure entertainment for anyone wishing to slay a somber afternoon. Highly recommended to all. ".

Entitled Summer in the City virtually all the exterior shots have snow covered groundscars and streets. The main character even speaks of how the snow makes Berlin seem to be a ghost town. Even weirder are the relationships Hans seems to have with three different girls all of whom are very attractive.In the first case he calls to ask if he can stay over for a few days which she agrees with. Later after moving from Munich to Berlin he simply appears in his friends' apartments playing an unknown board game in the first and being offered port wine in the second. There is never any hint of intimacy between him and any of the girls and when he finally leaves the third one there is five minutes or more of silent closeups of her in her rather modestly furnished apartment. Then there's the music notably by The Kinks To whom the film is dedicated the Lovin'Spoonful whose song used for the title of the movie is played in its entirety Bob Dylan the first two cuts from his John Wesley Harding album and many other rock and roll tunes from the late'60s. Very often the song has little if any apparent connection to what is transpiring on the screen at the time. And what it is that is transpiring for the majority of the films is movement we see Hans being driven in a car flying in an airplane walking the streets and taking a train all the time with a flowing montage of the passing street scenery. If nothing else Winders proves he's a master of steady cam operation. The 'plot'  Hans' apparent attempts to stay clear of the associates he had before some unknown bad deed landed him in prison is merely tangential at the most to the visual panoply of street scenes. And he smokes like a chimney! Very different quite unique but not all that inspiring.".

	schema:headline " Early Wenders still needs refinement";
	schema:reviewBody "Summer in the City is a West German film from 1971 so this one had its 45th anniversary last year. It was written and directed by Wim Wenders and for him it was after quite a few short films his very first full feature film. And he made quite a jump as this one comes fairly close to the twohour mark. The cast does not really include any wellknown names with the exception of lead actor Hanns Zischler who was like Wenders in his early 20s at that point and it was for him a bit of a breakthrough as well. He worked with Wim on other occasions too. This one is pretty similar compared to other Wenders works from decades ago. Lots of music it is in blackandwhite and it is all about the atmosphere as really very little happens from start to finish in here. It is an extremely slow movie. Sadly the formula is not working the way it did in other works by WW afterward such as Wings of Desire. I love the latter really but this one here is not even a poor man's version of that classic really. Quite a shame. It all feels so random really. For example there is a scene when Wenders acts himself in the film and plays pool billiard with a character for a while and absolutely nothing happens. They aren't talking even and Wenders' character disappears as quickly afterward as he showed up. People who like this film will call it chilling or relaxing but I personally found it boring. Oh yeah don't be fooled by the English title this one is in the German language. Actually this is another common thing for Wenders that several of his films are not in the same language as the titles maybe include a few words at best in this language. The title here is one of the many songs used in the movie and that scene near the end actually made for the perhaps most memorable moment and one of the few only good ones I would say. But it can not make up for all the lengths and I agree with the other reviewer that honestly the plot here does not match the runtime. As you read earlier Wenders did some stuff I enjoyed quite a bit but for this film here I must say it seems to me that he had not yet found the right approach. Thumbs down. Don't watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "Michael Radford an English director ought to be given credit for bringing this beautiful story to the screen. It speaks volumes that Mr. Radford achieves a triumph with a film that for all practical purposes should have been directed by an Italian. This is a timeless story of friendship poetry and love set in a desolated island that was to be Pablo Neruda's home in exile.The story is a simple one. Mario Ruoppolo a poor man without a job suddenly applies for a vacant position that will pay almost nothing but by becoming a letter carrier he gets the chance of meeting a man that will make a deep impression on him and who will change his life completely.Mario the postman is almost illiterate. He can read and write with only the basic knowledge he probably picked up in the island school. He is allergic to fishing and can't make a living like his father and probably most of his ancestors before him. It's the time after WWII in which a poor Italy is still recovering from the devastation and defeat.Pablo Neruda the Chilean poet finds a rustic home in the island. He is the most famous person ever to set foot in there. Mario is in charge for bringing Pablo his packages and mail. An easy friendship develops between them. Like everyone else in the island Mario is impressed by the foreigner. In trying to imitate his poet friend Mario awakens to all the beauty around him and discovers love with the gorgeous local girl Beatrice Russo.The film's mood changes right after Pablo Neruda and his wife receive assurances they can go back to their native land. This leaves Mario in a sad state but now that he is married he has other responsibilities to live for. Neruda had awakened in Mario a desire to speak for himself and to seek justice.This is a film totally dominated by the late Italian actor Massimo Troisi who as Mario completely captures us by just being a simple soul with no malice. Mr. Troisi is splendid in his take of this poor man who discovers beauty and poetry late in his life. Philippe Noiret is Pablo Neruda. Mr. Noiret makes a great contribution as the man who sees beauty everywhere and translates it into poetry. Maria Grazia Cucinotta is the beautiful Beatrice the woman who loves Mario. Renato Scarpa and Linda Moretti play minor roles with success.Il Postino is helped by the magnificent cinematography of Franco di Giacomo who captures the island in all its splendor. The music score is another asset. Luis Bacalov's tuneful background music adds another layer in this film rich texture. This film is an excellent way to be introduced to Pablo Neruda's poetry even if it's only for the curiosity the film will give even a casual viewer. Thanks to Michael Radford for a poetic view of this lonely place where two people meet and are changed forever.".

Massimo Troisi leaves his final legacy in the role of a shy hesitant and uncultured postman who possesses the heart of a poet with truly peculiar observations such as 'the whole world is the metaphor for something else' often without realizing how exciting his comments are...Director Michael Radford had the care to create a wonderful film which floats on the love of words rhythm and imagery... His movie is much heightened by a music score that includes quotes paraphrases and Argentinean tangos...His film turns out to be a great little movie... It deals with a friendship between a lethargic villager who takes the modest job of delivering letters to the celebrated poet living in a secluded area... Poetry becomes their connection...Mario Ruoppolo is a simple man with a complicated set of values who rides his bicycle climbing the hard road to Neruda's cozy home and with his timid manners delivers the armful of correspondence to the single customer of the island... A polite Neruda shows little interest in his personal postman but he favors him one day with his autograph signing one of his books with the words 'Regards Pablo Neruda.' Nevertheless as time passes the 'poet of love' becomes a bit more friendly intrigued by Mario's enthusiasm regarding his poetry and poetic manner of speaking... Mario impressed that almost every letter delivered to Neruda is from a female couldn't understand how his new resident despite his advancing age has such magical power over women... So he tries with his simple way of thinking to understand all the secrets of the exalted poet sharing his thoughts with him... He becomes increasingly curious asking a lot of questions about the mystical creation of poetry forcing the fascinating celebrity to reveal some of the unexposed materials of his artistic vision... Neruda introduces Mario to the verbal rupture of metaphors attempting to teach them to his anxious pupil... The two men discover an unexpected friendship based on their mutual view that life should be a framework for seduction and romance...As the film goes on Mario crafted with a tender spirit attempts through Pablo a gentle intervention and poetry to win over the woman he has fallen for Beatrice Russo  played by Sicilian fashion model Maria Grazia Cucinotta... Becoming in a slow way his 'Latin Cyrano de Bergerac' Neruda guides his postman into romance but refuses to write a poem that could charm his young passionate Beatrice...To attract the prettiest girl in town Mario becomes a bit of a poet himself... But when he finds his own words insufficient to his romantic mission he appropriates one of his tutor's sensuous poems and protests when discovered that Poetry doesn't belong to those who write it but to those who need it.Unbelievably his 'lyrical words' fascinate the sensual bombshell who was playing a mean game of table soccer in a low cut dress but disturb greatly her disapproving aunt Donna Rosa who sees that Mario is contaminating her niece with his nice words... Nevertheless the postman wins the beautiful Beatrice and convinces her to marry him... Heartbreak comes when Neruda receives a telegram that he can return to the country he loves so much... From here on an extended epilogue with smiles tears and regret takes the story on... And the film almost breathes lyrical tenderness in its depiction of an honest man who longs so much for love...Mario who has not received any word or greeting from the poet and had remarked that it's quite normal for the poet not to remember him returns to the poet's villa to revisit the place that had once been alive with the sounds and sights of emotional discovery... In the silence that now surrounds it he realizes that the poet has taken all the beautiful things away with him... He gets the idea to create a 'live' poem for his dearest friend Don Pablo... An outdoors tape to let him listen to the wonderful sounds of the island from the small and big waves at the Cala di Sotto to the wind on the cliffs to the wind through the bushes to the sad nets belonging to his father to the church bell of Our Lady of Sorrow to the starry sky over the island to Pablito's heartbeat... Philippe Noiret best remembered for 'Cinema Paradiso' charms us once again as the affectionate mentor to Mario... He convinces the postman that poets are quite human but warns Mario about the old Dictaphone saying 'Even the most sublime ideas sound ridiculous if heard too often.'The sets and the cinematography accompanied by an Oscar Winning Score create a wonderful atmosphere of the remote poor island with no running water of the modest houses with pealing plaster of the Rocky cliffs overlooking the blue Mediterranean of the postwar fishing village under the shades of rose and salmon...Like love itself some great movies seem surprisingly human... Delbert Mann's 'Marty' was one Cameron Crowe's 'Say Anything...' was another and now Michael Radford's Il Postino is exceptional... His film stands tall in its own right as a 'must see' movie... It's tough to imagine anyone not liking it... It simply revives our memories and breaks our heart...".

An outdoors tape to let him listen to the wonderful sounds of the island from the small and big waves at the Cala di Sotto to the wind on the cliffs to the wind through the bushes to the sad nets belonging to his father to the church bell of Our Lady of Sorrow to the starry sky over the island to Pablito's heartbeat... Philippe Noiret best remembered for 'Cinema Paradiso' charms us once again as the affectionate mentor to Mario... He convinces the postman that poets are quite human but warns Mario about the old Dictaphone saying 'Even the most sublime ideas sound ridiculous if heard too often.'The sets and the cinematography accompanied by an Oscar Winning Score create a wonderful atmosphere of the remote poor island with no running water of the modest houses with pealing plaster of the Rocky cliffs overlooking the blue Mediterranean of the postwar fishing village under the shades of rose and salmon...Like love itself some great movies seem surprisingly human... Delbert Mann's 'Marty' was one Cameron Crowe's 'Say Anything...' was another and now Michael Radford's Il Postino is exceptional... His film stands tall in its own right as a 'must see' movie... It's tough to imagine anyone not liking it... It simply revives our memories and breaks our heart...";

	schema:headline " Better than most all American romances.";
	schema:reviewBody "Il Postino is a movie that received oodles of critical acclaim upon its release in 1994. While I don't think it was as good as advertised I understand why it received such praise. In a movie world that is filled with dry and unamusing romance stories Il Postino is a relatively lush and beautiful tale. The plot is fairly simple but loaded with subtleties that allow even encourage multiple viewings. Mario Massimo Troisi longs for something more than his simple fisherman life on an Italian island so he takes a small job as a postman delivering mail to famed romantic poet Pablo Neruda Phillipe Noiret who is living in exile on the same island. Over time they develop a relationship that is based on Neruda aiding Mario in wooing his beloved Beatrice Maria Grazia Cucinotta. The final act is where the film makes the leap from wellmade standard fare to something greater. With a couple plausible plot developments characters and relationships are deepened beyond a basic love story to a place that accents everything that happens leading up to that point. I can't say much else without giving things away but stick with the movie to the end even if you're dragging midway through. As you might expect from an Italian film Il Postino has a very European feel. The passion of Italy is present throughout explained through lifestyles literal and metaphorical imagery and the emotions of the characters. The setting is far from the bustling dollardriven society in which Americans dwell and a movie like this wouldn't get made in America because the cultures are drastically different. The film's star Massimo Troisi is excellent. He embodies everyman qualities exceptionally similar to Tom Hanks yet with more...something. Soul perhaps? He like the entire film is just more European and I hope you understand what I mean by that. Noiret portrays Neruda perfectly expressing his romantic ways through both words and actions. Everyone else is very good although no one stands out the overall anonymity of the cast aids the viewer in establishing culture as well. The cinematography and the scenery it presents is often breathtaking although not in the sweeping manner of something like The Lord of the Rings. Rather cinematographer Franco Di Giacomo wisely chose to let the pictures speak for themselves. The elegant cliffs whitecapped waves and rolling topography of the island gently yet firmly frame and support the story. A straightforward tale should have suitable pictures and Il Postino meets that requirement. The film is touted as a romantic comedy and it is although not in the traditional sense. The comedy isn't slapstick and won't elicit bushels of laughter. But there is an underlying sense of humor laced through the whole movie often in simple movements tasks or occurrences.All of this combines to present something like a fairy tale replete with Italian heart and soul. Il Postino won't blow you away but its tender lessons about life love and friendship will stick with you for some time urging another viewing. Bottom Line A very European romance that is better than most anything Hollywood can conjure up.  810.  If you like the film get the Collector's Edition DVD it's quite good.".

I appreciate 1 the beauty of the ocean  2 the lovely music 3 the Italian language 4 the poetry of Pablo Neruda 5 the time that the Nobel Peace Prize poet spends with a poor mail deliverer who comes up hills on his  bicycle explaining to him what is a metaphor 6 the beautiful and sincere friendship between the two men 7 the love that Neruda has for his woman and 8 how Mario wants to impress the woman of his dreams with nothing else but the poetry written by Neruda. After his time in asylum Neruda goes back to Chile and his friend Mario misses him.  Later in the movie Neruda returns to the island and realizes how much he misses that honest and simple man who was so eager to learn when they met at the beach town. I love this movie! If I watch it some more my Italian will improve tremendously I can understand enough to watch the movie and not read the subtitles. I guess that makes the movie more meaningful to me as I understand it in the language that it was made in. Mario really wanted Neruda to mention him in interviews because he sensed that they both had influenced each others' lives.  Unfortunately when Neruda meets Pablito  Mario is no longer around. I highly recommend this movie. My favorite scene Is Neruda explaining to Mario what a metaphor is. That scene also provided me with my favorite quote Neruda Metaphors. Mario What are those? Neruda How can I explain when you talk of something comparing with the other? Mario Something you use in poetry? Neruda Yes! For example when you say the sky weeps what do you mean? Mario It is raining. Neruda Very good! That is a metaphor.  MarioIt's easy then. Why has it got such a complicated name? Neruda Man has no business with the simplicity of complexity of things. I have the tape and have enjoyed this movie every time I watched it. This movie deserves every award it has received. It is a wonderful movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Il Postino' is a love story between men. There's something poetic about that in this movie about love  poetry. Neither of them is gay mind you. In fact a ravishing beauty Maria Grazia Cucinotta is the object of the title character's affection. Still this movie belongs to Philippe Noiret and the Oscarnominated Massimo Troisi. Noiret is a Chilean poet exiled in Italy for his communist leanings. Troisi is the postman a man going nowhere who comes to idolize this intelligent poet. They become friends and Noiret essentially Cyranos Troisi into Cucinotta's ample heart.I didn't find the entire film to be heartrending but the final scenes add deep resonance to the material. My eyebrows were raised when the movie ended and there was a For Massimo credit. Troisi died less than a day after they finished shooting. It seems fitting that the end of the film is bittersweet because the cast  crew had been working with a dying man who wanted nothing more than to finish this final project. 'Il Postino' ended up grossing a boatload of money so his subtle performance clearly struck a chord with audiences.Troisi got all the press for his fine work but Noiret is certainly his equal. Director Michael Radford does well to stay out of their way. I like how he didn't sentimentalize the TroisiCucinotta relationship. He's infatuated with her but that diminishes a bit once he gets her. They're a fair representation of a real couple who were brought together for what might have been the wrong reasons. In fact the film is filled with surprises. It's a quiet character study but all the players in 'Il Postino' go through earthshaking changes of personal proportions. And the NoiretTroisi friendship is right at the heart of the matter.".

	schema:reviewBody "Set in the early 1950s on a small Italian island there are three central characters in this movie one real and the other two fictional. The real one is Chilean poet Pablo Neruda played by French actor Noiret who resembles Neruda quite nicely. Neruda died in 1973 but really did spend several years in exile in Italy and really is a worldfamous poet.In this fictional story simple and honest but somewhat dim 40something Mario Ruoppolo Massimo Troisi who died of heart failure right before the movie was released is the son of a small time fisherman. Mario really doesn't like the fishing but has no job. At dad's encouragement he finds a temporary job as a postman il postino. The famous poet is moving into the small village and a man with a bicycle is needed to deliver his mail daily. It pays very little in this poor village but it is a job. And the friendship that eventually develops between Neruda and Mario changes their lives.The third central character is pretty and sexy 20something Beatrice Maria Grazia Cucinotta who works in her fiercely protective aunt's bar and restaurant. Mario admires her from afar but Neruda's poetry gives Mario an entry. He tells Neruda later Poetry doesn't belong to those who write it it is for those who need to use it.A very charming and meaningful movie on DVD for those who don't mind reading English subtitles. Or listen to it in Italian or French. Some of my favorite scenes were the conversations between Mario and the poet when the mail was delivered.SPOILERS FOLLOW. Mario manages to win the affections of Beatrice through his poetry and they marry. The political climate changes in Chile allowing Neruda to return there. Mario is sad that Neruda does not seem to remember them. But he turns up perhaps 6 or 8 years later meets Mario's young son and Beatrice but finds that Mario had died in a rumble during a Communist rally in the square. The movie ends with Neruda on the beach where he and Mario had had so many wonderful conversations reflecting on the beauty of the island and how it influenced his poetry. And the friendship with Mario.".

	schema:reviewBody "Although Il Postino simply means The Postman and although the film was at one time screened as The Postman in Britain it is now generally known in English by itsItalian title to avoid confusion with Kevin Costner's postapocalyptic epic from three years later. It is loosely based upon the novelArdiente pacienciabythe Chileanwriter Antonio Skrmeta although it transfers the action from Chile to Italy. It takes as its startingpoint the fact that in the early 1950s the famousChileanpoetPablo Neruda in exile from his homeland for political reasons spent some time on the island of Capri. The film however is not set on Capri but on an unnamed Italian island. A young fisherman named Mario Ruoppolo applies for a job as the island's postman. As he owns a bicycle and is one of the very few islanders who can read and write he is accepted and is told that he will only have one customer Neruda himself as because of the low levels of literacy on the island nobody else ever receives any mail. Were standards of education really so low in fifties Italy?Although Mario has never previously heard of Neruda and certainly has never read any of his poems a friendship gradually grows up between the two men. Although Mario has had little formal education he is clearly an intelligent and sensitive man and Neruda reads him some of his poetry in Italian translation teaching him about literary concepts such as metaphors. With Neruda's help Mariowoos the beautiful Beatrice a village girl with whom he hasfallen in love stealing some of the older man's love poems and passing them off as his own in order to win her affections. My one criticism of the film would be that it is too sentimental about Communism but that is perhaps only to be expected of a film from Italy a country which at one time had the largest Communist Party in Western Europe. In the seventies they used to win around a third of the popular vote at a time when the British Communist Party generally consisted of three old men and a dog. Pablo Neruda is here portrayed as a kindly idealistic gentleman but in reality during the forties and early fifties he was a Communist hardliner who enthusiastically defended Stalin's dictatorship in the Soviet Union. After Khrushchev's 1956 secret speech he was to criticise the Stalinist cult of personality but this was due less to a change of heart than to a desire to align himself with the new official Soviet party line. He was also at the time of his Italian exile around twenty years younger than the character portrayed here by Philippe Noiret. Its politics aside however Il Postino is in many ways an excellent film. There is some attractive photography of the Italian coastal scenery and a great musical score by Luis Enrquez Bacalov. What really makes the film stand out however are the two great performances from Noiret and from Massimo Troisi who tragically died of a heart attack soon afterwards as Mario. There is also a good performance from the lovely Maria Grazia Cucinotta as Beatrice. Troisi received a posthumous Oscar nomination for Best Actor but lost out to Nicholas Cage in Leaving Las Vegas as I have never seen that film I am unable to comment on the justice of that decision. I felt however that it was unfortunate that there was no nomination for Noiret either as Best Actor or Best Supporting Actor. Indeed this is one of those films which make me feel that it should be possible to nominate two actors for a joint award as Noiret and Troisi combine together so well that their joint contribution seems greater than the sum of its two parts. This is the story of a touching relationship between two men of different generations of different nationalities of different levels of education and ofdifferent outlooks on life who are nevertheless united in friendship. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "With the possible exception of Shakespeare perhaps who can explain matters of the heart? For love can be that most elusive of butterflies as a smitten young man discovers in 'Il Postino' directed by Michael Radford. There's a bit of 'Cyrano' in this tale of Mario Ruoppolo Massimo Troisi a somewhat unprepossessing part time mailman he has but one customer who falls for a local beauty Beatrice Maria Grazia Cucinotta but has no idea how to pursue the longings of his heart. But as luck would have it Mario's customer just happens to be Pablo Neruda Philippe Noiret a South American expatriate who is also a world renown poet recently exiled to this small island off the coast of Italy. Not wanting to make a pest of himself Mario only very gradually strikes up an acquaintance with Neruda while his love for Beatrice goes unrequited. Once Neruda is apprised of Mario's situation however he begins to instruct him in the art of regarding the world around him in terms of metaphor as well as how to thus express himself. Soon Mario is composing poetry of his own with hopes of not only attracting Beatrice's attention but of winning her heart.It's a warm and touching story that plays to the heart rather than the intellect and will capture you with it's humanity. There is nothing singular about Mario he is nondescript just an average guy and it illustrates that common bond among us all that of having wants and needs to be expressed and fulfilled especially with regards to matters of the heart for as Mario discovers love knows no boundaries.Troisi gives a strong performance as Mario but is almost too retiring to be effective though his character contrasts well with that of Noiret's Neruda whose zest for life is more readily apparent. Still it's that underplayed sense of the 'Everyman' that Troisi conveys so well that allows the audience to relate to him. Anyone who has ever yearned for the affections of that special someone will be able to identify with Mario. Ironically it's his benign manner that makes him as contradictory as it may seem so memorable and forgettable at the same time perhaps depending upon the emotional investment the individual viewer is disposed to make. As the poet Neruda Noiret gives a notable performance lending the character the sense of one who has known celebrity yet is nonetheless still somewhat accessible. And in him you can readily perceive a true poetic nature though somewhat selfcentered which gives the character credibility and makes him real.The supporting cast includes Linda Moretti Donna Rosa Renato Scarpa Telegrapher Mariano Rigillo Di Cosimo and Anna Bonaiuto Matilde. A romantic film in every sense of the word 'Il Postino' nevertheless transcends the romantic and takes a somewhat anticlimactic turn that encompasses loyalty and passion to a cause as well as love. In the end it's a lyrical pacific film that seeks to discern the beauty in all things and certainly makes a statement about the nature of life and love. I rate this one 710.".

The waves are welcomed on the shore of tranquil and beautiful Capri as the final scene unwinds. Then a poem simply written on the black screen closes the tale by summarizing and succinctly depicting the essence of the movie before a dedication is made To our friend Massimo This is Troisi's film and he also participated in the fine writing with a simple but heartfelt story and exquisite dialogue. Although Troisi is also a director this time it is English director Michael Radford who will put all the pieces together of this timeless story and also contribute to the writing. In a way this is the beginning of how this project becomes international and goes beyond Italy both outside and inside the picture althought all the action actually takes place in Capri Italy. Argentinian Luis Enrquez Bacalov will win an Oscar for his peaceful poignant score. I suppose that French Philippe Noiret from Cinema Paradiso  fame will need as little directing as Troisi in portraying real life Chilean poet and political activist Pablo Neruda. In the movie you will also hear Spanish and hear about Chile and Sweeden Russia France as if they are actual characters of the movie.The screenplay is based on Chilean writer Antonio Skrmeta's El cartero novel about Nobel Prize winner Pablo Neruda and a bond he forms with a postman in Isla Negra in Chile. Skarmeta had already adapted his own work for the screen and directed it the Spanishlanguage Ardiente paciencia1983 which I would love to see eventually. Il Postino transposes the story to Italy where Neruda was given a place to stay in a villa in Capri by Edwin Cerio during his real life exile in 1952.The tale is simple enough. A young man who does not want to become a fishermen like most men of his hometown decides to be the private postman for pennies of popular poet that lives in exile in a nearby villa. Intrigued by this famous figure he starts to awkwardly ask questions about poetry and a genuine friendship develops between them.Mario the postman is lovestruck by Beautiful Beatrice Scicilian Maria Grazia Cucinotta and runs to the man who seemingly woes hundreds of women with words but her ultracatholic aunt may end up being a bigger obstacle than his lack of romantic banter. Beyond the typical love story that is more of a backdrop to the tale of friendship is the appreciation for poetry and in art to express the beauty of life. In fact in a way it is also Pablo Neruda's film. The real life poet who's poetry is used in the movie and who's life inspired the character that is so central to the story to the small town to Mario's growth as an individual. He who can barely read and write and says that he wants to be a poet just like his friend and idol. Very inspirational. A true work of art in every aspect. I cannot sincerely think of a bad thing to say about this one.".

No jump cuts fast pans or trick shots. Lots here is medium shot  mostly to get in the lovely Italian background and despite its sentimental base doesn't linger too long on anything. It is almost a case of nondirecting than directing.The story isn't really that promising in the telling and it speaks volumes for the talent of Philippe Noiret Massimo Troisi and Maria Grazia Cucinotta that they keep this simple minded piece going forward.Indeed Troisi's postman is a bit simple and can't really be considered anything but a country bumpkin. It is hard to believe that the redhot waitress played by Cucinotta would fall for him  not in the real world where others might notice her charms too! But hey this is a movie.Equally it is hard to really believe in the Chilean poet played by Noiret. He leaves his country for political reasons but returns because someone has told him it is now safe. Who is telling him this and should he believe them? A famous Communist or near Communist would never be safe in Chile in the late 1950's surely? But again I let this pass.As I said before there isn't a lot to this movie in the telling but there is a lot to it in the watching. The acting and the background are a treat and while the story is slow and without true dramatic thrust I loved it. For most audiences this will be a change of location and a change of language but we all need these things now and again.It doesn't challenge Nuovo Cinema Paradiso for being the high water mark of Italian cinema but its not that far behind either.".

For most audiences this will be a change of location and a change of language but we all need these things now and again.It doesn't challenge Nuovo Cinema Paradiso for being the high water mark of Italian cinema but its not that far behind either.";

The love story is compelling.  One can only empathize with the postal delivery man who yearns to understand the poetry of this world prominent figure.  There is excellent dialogue.  There are great pieces of stage business.  On DVD it still imparts a sense of compassion for the ideology of the author.  The political ties to South America are powerful.

	schema:reviewBody "I had never seen this film before but recently saw it as part of a library film series. Directed by Michael Radford it earned five Academy award nominations and won Best Original Dramic Score for Luis Enriquez Bacalov. This was a low budget film but went on to become the highest grossing nonEnglish language film for a long time. shot on location on the Italian islands of Salina and Procida and wonderfully photographed by Franco Di Gialomo this is the story of an unemployed and unmarried man Mario Ruoppolo Massimo Troisi reaching middle age years and is offered a small job as a postman with only one customer the exiled Chilean communist poet Pablo Neruda Phillipe Noiret who is staying on the island. Mario and Pablo develop a warm friendship which leads a new confident Mario into writing poetry himself to woo local beauty the barmaid Beatrice Russo Maria Grazia Cucinotta. Basically a two actor film with a great cast in Troisi Noiret and Cucinotta with great support in small roles from Linda Moretti as Neruda's mistress Donna Rosa and Renato Scarpa as Mario's boss. Nice costume design by Gianna Giss and production design by Lorenzo Baraldi. A fictionalized account of a brief 1952 stay on the island of Capri by Neruda written by Radford Troisi Furio and Giacomo Scarpelli and Anna Pavigano from a story by Antonio Skrmeta set in Argentina during Neruda's exile there. This is a touching story and very well rendered. It is visually artistic and dramatically poetic with touches of smart light comedy. It is painful to watch knowing that it's star Troisi filmed this against doctor's orders and ultimately ended up dying of a heart attack immediately after the principal filming. You can see him sweating in almost every scene even when he is not riding his bicycle and none of the other actors are sweating. For his health the director should have shut down or slowed production or recast him. A lot of work went into this for a small film and it paid off on the screen and at the box office. I would recommend this and give it an 8.5 out of 10.".

The postman is a very simple man who really should be ignored or tolerated by Neruda. Instead the man who loves poetry instills that love in this man who mumbles and stumbles with his words. Eventually they find themselves discussing deeper issues and the Postman begins to realize an intellectual potential. There is a comment later in the movie about ignorant people.

He loves her from afar though as he just cannot get up the nerve to let her know how he really feels. He needs an outlet. Enter exiled Chilean poet Philippe Noiret of Cinema Paradiso glory. Noiret has been kicked out of his native land because of his writings and his want to change the political practices of Chile. Troisi just happens to be the one who delivers Noiret's mail. Soon they create a friendship and Troisi discovers poetry for the first time. Now he has something to express himself that he never had before and he discovers that he can now let Cucinotta know how he feels via his writings. Noiret's appearance forever alters the lives of all those he ends up knowing in the small village. Il Postino was a big hit in 1994 in Italy and then became an international success in 1995 and even received some big Oscar nods in the latter year one for Best Picture. Sadly the main reason for this was the untimely death of Troisi just as production ended literally only several hours after the final day of shooting. Troisi who had come to prominence with Roberto Benigni was one of the country's biggest stars and his death only in his 40s at the time sent shockwaves through the cinematic world. In reality though Troisi was near death the whole time the movie was being made. He could hardly stand or sit up for long periods of time and director Michael Radford who received an Oscar nomination constantly wondered if Troisi would even be alive each day of shooting there were actual accounts of Radford asking his assistants each morning if Troisi was still alive. Once again the beautiful way the Italian cinema embraces smart human stories makes Il Postino one of the finest films of the last decade. Great performances solid direction a smart screenplay wonderful production values Oscarwinning score in particular and every other variable combine for an excellent movie experience. 5 stars out of 5.".

The script could have been better and the plot should have been filled out a bit but overall this is a very strange and intriguing flick that stays with you.

It sounds like a giant music box with an orchestra giving the impression of a children's story but with an evil twist.Angie buys the scissors a style used to cut fabric but which can also be used for more sinister purposes. Then she visits Mr. Kramer's thrift shop to buy a doll that needs repairing. She doesn't make a living fixing up dolls because she needs to get jobs through a temporary agency as well and she says dolls are only a hobby. Quite a hobbythere are so many in her bedroom it looks eerie and she says she doesn't have room to sleep there. It is never explained how she can afford an apartment in a nice building though rich parents are mentionedby someone who doubts they are real.When she gets back to her building Angie is greeted by the security guard. A lot of good he does Angie gets on the elevator and is nearly raped. She stabs the attacker with her scissors but he leaves with themand her purse which has her apartment keys.Angie goes to her neighbors who she has never really gotten to know. Alex Morgan is a soap opera actor and really nice. His identical twin brother Cole is a portrait artist and confined to a wheelchair. He seems weird and so are his paintings which border on pornography. At one point Cole confesses that Angie leaves her blinds open.Throughout the movie Angie is having difficulty coping with her recent attack. She is already in therapy. Again someone like her should not be able to afford this. Dr. Carter can do hypnosis and seems like he would be very expensive. Yet Angie sees him a lot and makes very little progress. She is frustrated that he believes she makes up a lot of things.One day Angie gets a job interview in a building that is mostly under construction. A sign in the elevator directs her to the top floor apartment apparently belonging to the developer. Angie goes in and finds herself trapped inside with no way to communicate she can't even be heard yelling through the windows and the two dog walkers who can see her ignore her. That's not all. There's a dead man with what appears to be her scissors in his back a creepy talking doll and a bird who keeps saying You killed him! Sharon Stone shows what she is capable of. Angie shows a wide range of emotions though someone like her wouldn't be expected to experience pure joy or excitement. Not that she couldn't have but the writers chose to make her mostly troubled.Steve Railsback does a very good job as well. I didn't realize the brothers were twins because to me they didn't even look alike. For one thing Alex wears glasses. But it is Cole that really shows Railsback's talent.Ronny Cox also does very well as the therapist. And you have to like the folksy Mr. Kramer who is only in a couple of scenes. And Midnight Angie's cat is so sweet and playful!This isn't really my kind of movie. But it has an interesting mystery and a very strange ending. It's not too violent but almost always slightly on the eerie side. At least the weird music gets replaced with pleasant music in the romantic scenes. I won't say who but there are several couples and one slightly naughty bedroom scene. Having seen this on broadcast TV I don't really know how explicit the movie gets.It's a good thriller for those who like that sort of thing.".

It's at the very end of the movie with Angie by now almost completely insane that the truth comes out to who's behind this plan in driving her off her rocker. And it didn't have anything to do with her at all but the realestate developer Mr. Bailey. And he Bailey's killer had a big surprise coming himself when he tried to pin Bailey's murder on Angie that ended blowing up in his face!";

When she was in she find no one in the apartment but when she tries to get out the door knob falls out. Little things start going on and every time she falls asleep things happen like doors open and stuff. Probably the best scene is when she finds her attacker from the elevator in the bed room with a scissor in his back with a bird flying around saying that she killed him. At the end we find that she was placed in this apartment by her trusted psychologist in an attempt to drive her mad. When the psychologist and his wife or is it associate enters the apartment she has enough smarts to walk out and trap them in there. She walks outside and is picked up by the nice twin brother that she ran into earlier in the movie.The ending is satisfying the pace is a little too slow but it's generally a good movie in my opinion.".

Better then other twin stuff you see in other movies or tv. Even friends which was 10 years after this movie didn't do their twin scenes with Pheobe and Ursula half as good. Anywho it was pretty freaky although I think they could have done a little more to make it worse!!! And there is a scene where Sharon Stone is nude... for no reason. That was kinda dumb. Watch this movie for something different... WAY different. I don't think this has been done before! Out of 10 I say 6.5 for taking a long time to get into the film!".

	schema:headline " Before Basic Instinct";
	schema:reviewBody "Scissors 1991 Starring Sharon Stone Steve Railsback Ronny Cox Michelle Phillips Vicki Frederick Lary Moss Austin Kelly Before Basic Instinct there was Scissors. Released in 1991 this obscure thriller stars Sharon Stone as the victimized patient of a crazed therapist who drives her to murder. Slight similarities to Basic Instinct which was not too far off have been detected. The choice of weapon in Instinct was an icepick in this film it is a pair of scissors as the title suggests. Sharon Stone delivers a good performance even though she is in a bad film with very little popularity. Everyone's heard of Basic Instinct but who's ever heard of Scissors ? Sharon plays a weak traumatized woman whose past was painful. Her father abused her sexually and her mother killed him with a pair of scissors right in front of her eyes. Consequently she grows into an emotionally and mentally unstable sexually repressed and frightened person. The hardup young woman seeks counseling with a therapist who turns out to be the real murderer in a vein similar to Hannibal Lecter only without the cannibalism. The mood is intense and dark and Sharon Stone has several Mad Scenes including one in which after murder a black bird reminds her vocally of the deed. Sometimes the film is hard to follow as several characters act as if they are the real brains behind the evil. In the end Sharon Stone finally gets the guts to confront the therapist and locks him up in a building for good. Stone is far from the character she would portray the following year in Basic Instinct. Here she is shy unassuming and does not display any nudity and instead wears colorful late 80's buttonedup clothes. As the movie ends a variation on the duet from the opera Lakme plays and Sharon Stone rides off in a cab with the only man who truly cared for her. OK. So this no Basic Instinct. This movie falls short on a lot of things. Basic Instinct launched Sharon Stone's career and made her famous. This movie was experimental and Sharon Stone had not yet achieved the status of star. It can be said that this movie is for specialized interests. It's a film for fans of Miss Stone who don't mind what character she plays and in what kind of movie. For thriller fans however bad the thriller can be or however hackneyed. An early 90's film it really attests to its time. At one point Stone looks like Madonna. The eerie and shocking feel of the movie was very typical of the 90's. The 90's would see other such thrillers involving crazed murderers such as Silence Of The Lambs Misery The Hand That Rocks The Cradle and Sleeping With The Enemy. Add this lesser thriller into your collection.".

Stone does the best she can with the material thats given her but you cannot blame the director solely. Stone just wasn't that good in certain scenes and at times it becomes downright silly. Vicki Frederick from All The Marbles has a role and Clint Eastwoods buddy Albert Popwell Or Powell has a part as a cop.

His ex and his twin brother another two! play one role in front of him and another when with each other! Two's company to be sure! And the list goes on.The possible calculations of all these two's allow the movie to traverse its twists and turns without too much friction... it's a thriller and we don't want to know who done it? till the end right?? So we learn a little about SchizoAngie's world and very little it is at that and then see her plunged into a carefully designed even designer nutball apartment of hell. And believe me what goes on would be enough to send anyone schizo let alone someone already suffering problems! The acting is passable... Stephen Railback does well playing both twin brothers Ronny Cox plays the same character he always does... oooh he can look mean when he wants to! And Sharon Stone has her usual moments of smouldering sexuality determined beauty and vulnerable perfection which make her performance and her 20something virginal character acceptable! However I did spot one rather interesting fish impression... I wonder if she's thought of developing that into a mermaid role or something!! The complexity of the situation Angie finds herself in is what really makes the film. With thrillers or horrors we viewers do need to ask just how will she get out of that!

She's able to fight him off with some red scissors that she had just bought. When she gets to her floor her neighbor Alex Steve Railsback comes to help. She also meets his crippled brother Cole Railsback but he gives her a bad feeling. The trauma of the attack keeps bothering Angie who tries to talk it out with her therapist Ronny Cox but something just isn't adding up for her.SCISSORS has a very active and aggressive screenplay that covers the stuff that I mentioned in my summery but it has a lot of other things going on as well. That includes an entire subplot dealing with Angie suffering from various sexual issues that has caused her to be a virgin at the age of 26. This film really has a lot going on for it but when it's all said and done it's basically a B movie with interesting ideas that never really comes to life.The first hour of this movie has various tones lifted from Roman Polanski's REPULSION but sadly it's all done in such a way where there's no suspense or tension. The Polanski film is really borrowed from during the final act which I won't spoil but this is where the movie really crashes and burns. I understand what director Frank De Felitta was going for but everything is just so flat and boring that the film just never works and in fact it really falls apart at the end. Again I'm not going to spoil the twist but it just doesn't work.Stone turns in a good performance but her character just isn't written well enough to where it can fully come to life. I thought Railsback was very good in the role of the good brother and he certainly stole the film whenever he was on screen. Cox is good in his brief role but sadly none of the performances are able to overcome the rather bland direction and a story that just keeps going and going to the point where you just grow tired of it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Being a comics collector I had to see this movie since it is based on a comic book. When I left the cinema I was both disappointed and gratified but looking back on it I found my disappointment waning and my gratification growing. This was  or rather could have been if it had been successful enough to spawn a franchise  a new Highlander which is just about my favorite movie. It had all the elements. Unfortunately it also had some bad things. That Nazis were the villains is really something I could have done without. It made the movie unintentionally comical by which I mean laughable not comic booklike before it had even gotten well underway. And the Funktastic character has GOT to rate as one of the WORST things in ANY movie EVER EVER I say!!. But I think there was enough good stuff in the rest of the movie to make up for these howlers.The cast indeed was very charismatic and did not feel like just another set of interchangeable Hollywood cronies. I expected not to like Seann William Scott but I ended up feeling he did a great job and no I didn't see the ridiculous American Pie movies what're you nuts!?. Despite what others may say I thought his kung fu was convincing and his character actually endearing. I've never been that big a fan of Chow Yun Fat because he's more a gangster movie actor than a kung fu movie actor and I have no fondness for Hong Kong or for that matter Hollywood gangster movies. But as in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon which I loved and have seen many many times he filled his role very nicely here. Note that his superhuman kung fu was explained by his possessing the power of the scrolls it wasn't just gratuitous. As for Jamie King she just wowed me totally. She radiated both toughness and beauty and ultimately tenderness and seemed like a believable character. Her being the daughter of a Russian mafia boss made her fighting skills credible.One of the things I appreciated most about this movie was its ending. I'm usually always disappointed with really badly written Hollywood endings but I absolutely LOVED this one. For both of the young leads to share the power was a great idea also serving to bond them in their relationship and it could make for a superb superherolike sequel since their fighting skills were radically increased by the power of the scroll. Unfortunately we'll probably never see it. Sigh.".

	schema:headline " Very good but light fantasyaction entertainment";
	schema:reviewBody "Chow YunFat is the Monk with No Name who protects an ancient scroll. Anyone who recites the scroll can harness unlimited power utilizing it for either good or evil. The scrollkeeper has the advantage of not aging and not being able to be physically harmed. The Monk has been on the run from would be rulers of the universe for 60 years when he finally runs into a potential new scrollkeeper as promised by prophecies.Bulletproof Monk is a light comic bookfantasyactionmartial artscomedy film in the vein of The Golden Child 1986 and The Medallion 2003. It leans most strongly towards the fantasy genre but it's frequently funny perhaps more subtly than one would expect and loaded with visually poetic wireheavy martial arts.Seann William Scott is Kar a street kid who has a flair for kung fu which he picked up by endlessly watching and emulating Asian films at the theater where he both lives and works as the projectionist. He has even more of a flair for pickpocketing. The Monk runs into him while both are on the run and there are a number of cleverly staged scenes where Kar tries to palm a few extra bucks while the Monk attempts to teach him both ethics and enlightenment via koans about things like hot dogs and buns.During these early scenes they run into a hilarious group of what are effectively CHUDs Cannibalistic Humanoid Underground Dwellers minus the C headed by a roosterhaired thug named Funktastic. This is some of the more slyly funny material in the filmthe HUDs even have an abandoned subway car turned disco in their underground lair.The kung fu throughout most of Bulletproof Monk is of the variety often mythologized by kids as being akin to magic. The Monk can defy gravity move fast enough that he seems to predict his opponent's moves with near omniscience and dodge bullets. He can even fight and eat a bowl of Cocoa Puffs at the same time. The real aim is to approach a Matrix 1999like realitybending in the film's universe. Although the fantasy almost dancelike nature of many of the fight scenes may turn off those looking for more realistic action Troy Liddell also choreographs some parts of fight scenes more traditionally with YunFat performing something very similar to aikidohe primarily yields instead of blocking or countering and uses his opponent's moves against themselves. It's an interesting approach that isn't used often enough in martial arts films.The principle flaw with Bulletproof Monk is that too many plot elements and characters seem to flow by too quickly. There isn't a lot of time to delve very far into many threads.

	onyx:emotionText "Chow YunFat is the Monk with No Name who protects an ancient scroll. Anyone who recites the scroll can harness unlimited power utilizing it for either good or evil. The scrollkeeper has the advantage of not aging and not being able to be physically harmed. The Monk has been on the run from would be rulers of the universe for 60 years when he finally runs into a potential new scrollkeeper as promised by prophecies.Bulletproof Monk is a light comic bookfantasyactionmartial artscomedy film in the vein of The Golden Child 1986 and The Medallion 2003. It leans most strongly towards the fantasy genre but it's frequently funny perhaps more subtly than one would expect and loaded with visually poetic wireheavy martial arts.Seann William Scott is Kar a street kid who has a flair for kung fu which he picked up by endlessly watching and emulating Asian films at the theater where he both lives and works as the projectionist. He has even more of a flair for pickpocketing. The Monk runs into him while both are on the run and there are a number of cleverly staged scenes where Kar tries to palm a few extra bucks while the Monk attempts to teach him both ethics and enlightenment via koans about things like hot dogs and buns.During these early scenes they run into a hilarious group of what are effectively CHUDs Cannibalistic Humanoid Underground Dwellers minus the C headed by a roosterhaired thug named Funktastic. This is some of the more slyly funny material in the filmthe HUDs even have an abandoned subway car turned disco in their underground lair.The kung fu throughout most of Bulletproof Monk is of the variety often mythologized by kids as being akin to magic. The Monk can defy gravity move fast enough that he seems to predict his opponent's moves with near omniscience and dodge bullets. He can even fight and eat a bowl of Cocoa Puffs at the same time. The real aim is to approach a Matrix 1999like realitybending in the film's universe. Although the fantasy almost dancelike nature of many of the fight scenes may turn off those looking for more realistic action Troy Liddell also choreographs some parts of fight scenes more traditionally with YunFat performing something very similar to aikidohe primarily yields instead of blocking or countering and uses his opponent's moves against themselves. It's an interesting approach that isn't used often enough in martial arts films.The principle flaw with Bulletproof Monk is that too many plot elements and characters seem to flow by too quickly. There isn't a lot of time to delve very far into many threads. This gives the film a more superficial feel that should have been solved by lengthening and tightening the focus to give elements at least a typical James Bond film significance and weight. Aspects of the film may also be a bit too clichd for some viewers tastes.But you probably wouldn't watch Bulletproof Monk expecting a masterpiece.

Whilst the scenes in BPM are not as polished or well done as those in the Matrix they are entertaining enough and the choreography and use of props showed much more promise and imagination than those in the Wachowski Bros. productions at least in regard to the Matrix Reloaded anyhow.But this film did not receive the hype that TMR did and consequently my expectations of it were lower. As a result I was not disappointed in BPM as I was with TMR. Sure its all silliness but at least it has the humour to go along with that silliness. In short it doesn't take itself too seriously and neiither should the audience.ChowYun Fat shows he can play nonserious roles and get away with it and Sean William Scott shows he can do other parts away from American Pie and its teen comedy clones. But a particular joy to see in this film is the appearance of Mako whom I haven't seen much of in recent years. He only has a small role in this film but he steals the show whenever he's on screen.The kungfu isn't quite as wild as Crouching Tiger's flying escapades nor is the wirework quite so obvious. All in all a fun movie that should be watched as it was intended as sheer escapism.There are a few bad points. Watch out for the villain at the end. He should get the worst villain's hairstyle award for his mullet. That and the ludicrous torture machine are the lighter negative aspects in an otherwise entertaining movie and even they somehow just add to the fun. The only really dire moment is Mr Funktastic's atrocious British accentchoice of language. There are some things Hollywood will NEVER get right!".

Furthermore I believe that comic book based films are finally coming into their own as commercial cinema. However Bulletproof Monk though entertaining at times never really grabbed me.

There is a certain onedimensionality to the characters the script and the portrayals which can not be escaped in this film. Chow Yun Fat has been charged with the protection of a scroll which is endowed with the secret of eternal life for over 60 years. The scroll is sought by a maniacal nazi who inexplicably turns up in Tibet during World War Two and equally improbably leads a small contingent of followers in New York city in contemporary times. Chow Yun Fat who is in NYC for an unknown reason probably not the best place to protect an ancient scroll of incredible power and importance playing an unnamed Tibetan monk is pursued by this militia just as he begins to befriend a protg who he believes might be a prophesied successor in his task of protecting the scroll Seann William Scott. An uneasy apprenticeship begins...The script is packed with martial art  HollywoodBuddhist philosophical clichs though I have to admit that this film does Buddhism better than many of its competitors. Most of these paradoxes and objects of meditations are unfortunately delivered in matteroffact disaffected tones.

Of course Bruce was not really a traditional Buddhist not a very ttraditional martial artist.The cinematography is good. I especially enjoyed seeing so many familiar sights in the world's greatest city and some of the artistically fantastic if not entirely believable sets. It was also nice to see old friends like Mako.

Both Scott and Chow are funny especially Chow the wirefu is entertaining Jaime King is hot and the whole movie works.It's not the best film ever and I couldn't tell you if it's the best Chow YunFat film ever since my local Hollywood video lacks his Hong Kong imports. But Bulletproof Monk may entertain those who like cheesy martial art flicks or appese the action junkie while he has to wait to see the next summer blockbuster.

There is plenty of action but much of it looks rather fake and not in the beautifully choreographed way of films like 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon'. Nazis have been a popular choice for villains ever since the war but they have been a clich for much of that time and here it feels as though somebody watched 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and decided they wanted those villains! Chow Yun Fat does a good job as the monk he is genuinely funny and is great in the action sequences. Seann William Scott is okay as Kar but doesn't really have the presence for the role. Jaime King who plays Kar's love interest Jade had more of a presence and I'd have preferred it if her character had a greater role rather than Kar. Overall this is okay if you want some mild action and don't mind all the clichs not necessarily a film to seek out but it passes the time well enough.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is pretty hard to take a film seriously when it starts with two monks sparing on a bridge and flying around. That whole karateflyingChinese wire trick...really...why? But Bulletproof monk pulls it off well. For starters it is the first movie with an explanation of how to walk on air. But mainly the two lead roles are likable and drive the story forward all the time.The old guy from Tibet is neither Jackie Chan nor some martial arts guru. More like a regular guy you might want as a neighbour. The young guy is a New York pick pocket smart kid but not falling into any easy pidgeon holes either. None of those overdone slow motion stylistic shows action movies on a budget often fall for. If our hero needs to take out ten bad guys OK he does some fancy stuff but he gets on with it.Plot is the normal thing. We all have to protect some ancient scroll with the secret to ultimate power. Twist is that some Nazi has been chasing it since the second World War. Yeah we have heard that before too. But it really doesn't matter the take is fresh. My kids watched it straight after the Spiderwick Chronicles same story protecting a book from evil but they didn't mind at all.The girl in the film is interesting too. While Star Wars fans pine and groan about Rey not getting her own doll the female lead in this film is cool sexy sweet tough able and with a nice twist at the end does real equality sort of stuff.

But Bulletproof monk pulls it off well. For starters it is the first movie with an explanation of how to walk on air. But mainly the two lead roles are likable and drive the story forward all the time.The old guy from Tibet is neither Jackie Chan nor some martial arts guru. More like a regular guy you might want as a neighbour. The young guy is a New York pick pocket smart kid but not falling into any easy pidgeon holes either.

This applies particularly to Bulletproof Monk which at first glance is a movie for teens. Its got martial arts guns Matrixstyle fight scenes a hot babe and even a plot that involves Nazis and a sacred artifact a la Indiana Jones. But where as the Indy flicks could definitely play to all ages even with all the bloody shootings and gory death scenes that must have stretched the PG ratings in Raiders of the Lost Ark and Temple of Doom Bulletproof Monk is strictly a kids' flick. What does that mean? It means if you're over the age of twelve you'll probably find yourself bored by the film. How exactly does this movie narrow its appeal only to kids? Well there's the story which involves the sacred artifact which must not get in the hands of evil. Yeah sure I know what you're thinking the Indy flicks all had that same premise too. But there's a difference. The first and third not so much the second truly gave the viewer a good idea of what was at stake if the prized possession fell into the wrong hands and better yet the macguffins were far more interesting than what's given to us here. I mean come on which would you prefer the Ark of the Covenant and the Holy Grail or a sacred scroll? Chow YunFat plays the protector of the scroll a job that sounds like it'd suck considering it means living a life on the run. But there are benefits notably the fact that he's impervious to bullets and can't age so long as he's the scroll's guardian. His only mission is to protect it while searching for the next guardian. That's where Seann William Scott comes in.Playing a pickpocket named Kar he's the typical Thief with a Heart of Gold. So now Chow's got to train Kar to be the next protector while also evading capture from a nasty old Nazi Karel Roden who wants the rejuvenating powers of the scroll for himself.Watching Bulletproof Monk there's a clear sense of desperation on hand. Director Paul Hunter his feature film debut does a messy job of putting this film together sloppily introducing puzzling plot elements along the way the training school for potential scroll guardians goons led by Roden's granddaughter the origin of Kar's martial arts. It's like a cut and paste job the worst part being the fact that too much of it is pasted together with MTVstyle edits and quick cuts. A couple of the action sequences are okay but most of it collapses in a mess of unconvincing martial arts awful bluescreens and confusing editing. Seann William Scott is an odd choice to play Kar mostly because the script doesn't play the role to his talents that is it doesn't give him any lowbrow humor to work with. Scott's made a career out of playing total goofballs so it comes as a bit of a surprise that Chow YunFat has more moments of comic relief. Adding James King into the mix is merely a bone tossed to either the girlpower female crowd or the horny male teens. Because her performance and martial arts work are subpar she won't appeal to the former and because she doesn't get naked she'll only marginally appeal to latter.Chow YunFat is still the best thing Monk has going for it he's charming likable and surprisingly quite funny. It's also interesting to see that at this stage of his career he's leaning more towards martial arts flicks than his usual heroic bloodshed films he was so famous for in Hong Kong.At the beginning of this review I noted that Monk was a kids' flick how does that work? Simple take every possible kickass element martial arts gun battles hot chicks that is used to appeal to the teenage to twentysomething crowd and water it down so that only kids will enjoy it hardly any bonecrunching violence Chow only uses guns once zero nudity and hardly any cleavage etc..".

I think that the problem with her character was basically because she had a very over emphasised British accent. Smurfit is Irish so why the hell didn't they just maintain her natural accent. Worse though was Marcus Jean Pirae as the underground gang boss. He has no excuse though. His too was an over emphasised British accent.......but actually IS English I believe.

	schema:reviewBody "For a clichd piece of fluff because that's clearly what BULLETPROOF MONK is it's a far better film than you might imagine. Much of that likability rests on whether you like or loathe Seann William Scott the actor best known for his goofy roles like Stifler in the American PIE films. I have to say I love his acting and I find him a very funny person probably the only person in Hollywood today who can bring a smile to my face. So much of my entertainment in this film came from his appearance playing a thief turned hero.Elsewhere this is the kind of bogus mystical flick that gets churned out regularly by studios. It's very similar to THE MEDALLION with Jackie Chan which came out in the same year and I enjoyed it equally as much as that movie. One thing you have to remember is that these are lightly plotted bits of nonsense heavily clichd throughout and displaying the kind of wirework I usually loathe. BULLETPROOF MONK is a silly film sometimes completely stupid  like the villain's lair for instance  but it's hard to dislike as a buddybuddy type comedy.Chow YunFat is the straight man used to doing this kind of noble hero stuff in his sleep and the film just kind of takes place around him. Scott supplies the comedy I'm not sure what Jaime King is around for other than to look very pretty and Karel Roden is a Nazi villain who seems to have come straight out of HELLBOY. There are some other amusing bit parts like the appearance of Mako in one of his last roles plus British television actress Victoria Smurfit playing another villain with a stiffupperlip accent.The action isn't great but it has a nicely violent edge for what is essentially a kid's film. I didn't care for the wirework but the straightforward fighting scenes are good. They rip off Jackie Chan films pretty heavily for the style choreography and reliance on props but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Special effects are decent and the film has a good pace. While the dialogue isn't entirely credible and some of the minor characterssituations completely laughable and not in a good way for the most part BULLETPROOF MONK is amiable tosh and a film I got a lot of enjoyment from.".

The fights are great even if they are not so polished like other movies from then but it actually adds up to the enjoyment of the film wich kinda feels like one of those Chinese martial arts flicks.As for the humor and jokes that's the thing I always enjoyed more of anything in this film. From one liners to the absurd situations our heroes and villains stumble it's easy to be entertained. If you don't believe me check out the scene of the noodle soup instructions or the handshake between kar and the monk apprentice.Simply put it has everything explosions a beautiful and talented girl in Jade martial arts a Mcguffin of epic proportions Nazis as villains wich never live it down etc. Watch it if you want to spend some time with light fun and without convoluted themes.I don't deny it has flaws but after all this is a movie that doesn't take itself seriously so you shouldn't be disappointed if you wanted to find something more dark and edgy.By the way to those of you that won't believe the sight of Nazis in Tibet claiming it's false and bullshit check your facts Nazi Germany send some explorers to the rea in the hopes of expending their knowledge about the arian race and phisionomy of the locals others say that the expeditions were made to contact the people of Shammballa or other mythological folk. So while there were Nazis in Tibet sometime in the 1930's they withdrawn when the war kept growing and growing.Enjoy the film!".

	schema:reviewBody "Gritty realism and a riveting performance by Steve McQueen highlight the World War II actiondrama Hell Is For Heroes' directed by Don Siegel.  The setting is France 1944 and American troops are spread thin across a sector of the Siegfried Line.  When heavy action in another area precipitates troop movement a squad of six men is left behind to hold the position until reinforcements arrive which means a day or maybe two of making the Germans believe they are actually up to strength with a full complement of men.  Not an easy task but like the man said war is hell.  With Sergeant Larkin Harry Guardino in charge and left to their own devices for survival the men of the 2nd Squad dig in for what just may be the longest night of their lives.  And for some it will prove to be not only the longest but their last.  In the shadow of a murderous pill box held by the enemy the soldiers make their stand and add yet another footnote to another chapter in the history of the eternal struggle for freedom.Filmed in stark blackwhite Siegel's film succinctly captures the fatal brutality of war in terms perhaps not as graphic but every bit as effectively as Steve Spielberg would do some thirtysix years later with his monumental film Saving Private Ryan.'  Siegel may not have had the special effects in 1961 that Spielberg had at his disposal in 1998 but he did have an excellent screenplay by Robert Pirosh and Richard Carr from which to work.  He tells his story in a direct unromanticized way that maintains the focus and conveys the sense of urgency of the moment through which he builds the tension and suspense that makes the peril of the situation immediate and real.  Siegel had two predominant elements going for him that helped him achieve success with this venture  One was an instinctive knowledge of what works and how to deliver it but most of all he had Steve McQueen to sell it.McQueen plays Pvt. John Reese a veteran soldier who transfers into this particular outfit on the very day they are ordered to the front line.  And that's just the way Reese wants it.  When he reports for duty three days late he runs into Sergeant Pike Fess Parker who had served with him in another campaign.  It's late evening and the troops are assembling at an old church outside of town that now serves as a makeshift barracks Pike sees Reese and asks him how he is.  Thirsty' Reese replies.  Town's off limits' Pike tells him.  The very next scene shows Reese walking into town and finding what appears to be the only bar on a lonely street.  Stepping up to the counter Reese asks the bartender a woman for a bottle.  One pack or two?' he asks.  We aren't allow to serve soldiers' she says.  Two' he replies and setting the cigarettes on the counter he walks around and takes a bottle.  And now without a doubt we know exactly who and what Reese is the personification of the iconoclastic loner embodied to perfection in the form of Steve McQueen.By all accounts McQueen was not only a tough guy on screen but in real life as well tough meaning that he was always up for a challenge of any kind and determined to live by his own set of rules no matter what the cost.  But he was a complex individual and that was but one side of his true persona.  To play Reese McQueen went to that dark stoic side of himself exaggerated it and the result was one of the most intense characters he ever created.  Reese is a force of one adamant and relentless singleminded and fatalistic.  At the moment he's on the Siegfried Line but for him it's just another battle in a war he's been waging with life since the day he was born.  And he knows deep down that it's a war he's never going to win it's just a matter of time before his hand plays out and being on the line is just as good a place as any.  For him it's not a matter of options but of inevitability.  It's an exemplary performance and one for which McQueen never received the acclaim he was due which unfortunately was not an isolated instance in his career.  There was Vin in The Magnificent Seven' Frank Bullitt in Bullitt' and Tom Horn in Tom Horn' as well.  And that's but a sample of the work he did for which he never received enough recognition.  His only real acknowledgement came with his creation of Jake Holman in The Sand Pebbles' a role for which he was nominated and should have received the Oscar for Best Actor. But Reese was one of his first and one of his best.The supporting cast includes Bobby Darin Corby James Coburn Henshaw Mike Kellin Kolinsky Joseph Hoover Captain Loomis Bill Mullikin Cumberly Nick Adams Homer and Bob Newhart in his film debut as Pvt. Driscoll.  Hardhitting and with unforgiving realism Hell Is For Heroes' though on a smaller scale perhaps than Spielberg's Ryan' is one of the most effective and memorable war films ever made Siegel gave it direction and focus McQueen brought it to life.  And it's quite simply one of the best of it's kind you'll ever see.  I rate this one 1010.".

But he was a complex individual and that was but one side of his true persona.  To play Reese McQueen went to that dark stoic side of himself exaggerated it and the result was one of the most intense characters he ever created.  Reese is a force of one adamant and relentless singleminded and fatalistic.  At the moment he's on the Siegfried Line but for him it's just another battle in a war he's been waging with life since the day he was born.  And he knows deep down that it's a war he's never going to win it's just a matter of time before his hand plays out and being on the line is just as good a place as any.  For him it's not a matter of options but of inevitability.  It's an exemplary performance and one for which McQueen never received the acclaim he was due which unfortunately was not an isolated instance in his career.  There was Vin in The Magnificent Seven' Frank Bullitt in Bullitt' and Tom Horn in Tom Horn' as well.  And that's but a sample of the work he did for which he never received enough recognition.  His only real acknowledgement came with his creation of Jake Holman in The Sand Pebbles' a role for which he was nominated and should have received the Oscar for Best Actor. But Reese was one of his first and one of his best.The supporting cast includes Bobby Darin Corby James Coburn Henshaw Mike Kellin Kolinsky Joseph Hoover Captain Loomis Bill Mullikin Cumberly Nick Adams Homer and Bob Newhart in his film debut as Pvt. Driscoll.  Hardhitting and with unforgiving realism Hell Is For Heroes' though on a smaller scale perhaps than Spielberg's Ryan' is one of the most effective and memorable war films ever made Siegel gave it direction and focus McQueen brought it to life.  And it's quite simply one of the best of it's kind you'll ever see.  I rate this one 1010.";

He gets busted from squad leader to Private when he crashes a jeep. His squad gets sent to the front lines where he clashes with bythebook Sergeant Larkin Harry Guardino. Problems are made worse when the Company pulls out leaving Larkin's squad to cover a huge section of the front lines. In order to succeed they trick the Germans in various ways to make them think they're a much larger unit.The film features a powerful central performance by Steve McQueen. While his lines are short and to the point his facial expressions and movements are just as important. He makes a very convincing frontline soldier doing a lot of things many other frontlinecombat themed war movies of the time TO HELL AND BACK etc leave out.Supporting McQueen are Bobby Darin James Coburn and Mike Kellin all very young. Their characters were unique at the time but may seem a bit chliched and twodimensional if you've seen a lot of war pictures.Also lending a hand if Bob Newhart as a bumbling typist who ends up getting commandeered to help hold the front line position. His telephone monlogue scene is a classic and he makes a very believable scaredstiff REMF just like Jeremy Davies as Cpl. Upham in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.The battle scenes were obviously filmed on a tight budget but are very authentic appearing. They involve soldiers bleeding profusely and screaming in agony  not something you see in older war films.All in all a very well done realistic and very believable war film. It was apparently based on a true incident.The DVD is of high quality. It is finally in letterbox format about a 1.781 ratio. The video quality is superb. The sound is mono but very good mono quite rich. Also included is a widescreen but scratchy and grainy trailer.I enjoy and admire HELL IS FOR HEROES so much that I am using it as a model for my own WWII home video BATTLEGROUND.".

German soldiers are graphically burned to death with flame throwers shot to pieces with tommy guns and cut to ribbons with a machete. The action was especially graphic for when this film was made and I am very surprised so much intense violence got past the censors. I think the high resentments still around post war account for this. People wanted to see the Nazis get their well deserved violent end. The film is a good depiction of war and what it does to the men who are on the front lines. I am amazed when I watch it to see what a good actor Bobby Darin was and how well newcomer Boby Newhart did in his comic relief role. Steve McQueen and James Coburn were just about to hit their stride. They both give memorable performancesespecially McQueen who is the dark hero. Harry Guardino who would later work for director Seigel in Dirty Harry is also a sympathetic figure. He was such an underrated character actor. The American soldiers depicted in the film are a good cross section of America as it was constituted in the 40's. If you love war films and have not seen this one go out of your way to do so. This is I think the best of the low budget black and white war films of the 50's and early 60's.".

	schema:headline " Excellent gritty no nonsense war movie.";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a very underrated film. The cinematography is accurate for WW II northern Europe the script is quite believable and the film shows the audience that leadership and courage do not necessarily equate with rank or position.McQueen who served in the Marine Corps gives a gritty totally believable performance as a busted alcoholic loser who receives a rehab transfer to a front line unit in the 95th Infantry Division during WW II.There doesn't appear to be much potential for Reese. But as the story unfolds and the platoon is put in dire circumstances assigned to hold an area that would take a reinforced company he emerges as a savvy combat vet and natural leader. He is the only member of the unit who understands the bigger picture of what has happened and what the men must do to save themselves. They must probe the German lines at night in order to give the impression they are a company at full strength otherwise the Germans to their front will make a push to over run their undermanned position. Upon locating the machine gun bunker that has pinned down the platoon since they took their positions McQueen again the only true leader in the bunch plans an assault to take the gun out. One can debate the merits of his plan but the point is no one else in the platoon took charge and no one else said they shouldshould not take the gun out. Subsequently the mission fails and one man is killed. But it is the nature of war that men die. The company commander who should have left a senior NCO with the platoon returns from some nefarious all night meeting just after the disastrous raid ends and immediately blames Reese for everything.The last scene brings the film's title and moral into clear focus. Reese is facing a courtsmartial that will pin his ears back after the upcoming offensive is over. But despite this he continues to do the right thing he takes out the German bunker even at the risk of his own life. The end scene justifies the movie's title. Reese is the only hero here and his only reward is condemnation and death.The action is taut and well paced. Bob Newhart is excellent as a clerk who gets lost and ends up with the platoon getting on the job training as a rifleman. His telephone scenes are priceless. The rest of the supporting cast is superb.This is one of Steve McQueen's finest performances. He is dark and serious throughout the film and his character makes no attempt at comedic relief that is left to Bobby Darin and Bob Newhart. Because of this fact McQueen's performance is riveting and powerful.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of Steve McQueen's better roles is one that is modeled on one that James Cagney played in The Fighting 69th. If you'll remember Cagney was a wise guy who lost his nerve on the battlefield and was sentenced to be shot but redeemed himself in a heroic climax.Now McQueen wasn't a coward and he didn't have a priest like Pat O'Brien to have faith in him. But he was a reckless sort and convinced of his own righteousness. It negated his acts of bravery and when the film opens we find him down to being a private and under the command of a sergeant played by Fess Parker who likes him but understands him all too well.And Parker's platoon has a really rotten assignment. Hold their position on the Siegfried Line with a handful of men until help arrives and maybe convince the Germans there's a lot more out there than there really are. McQueen in his usual rebel way goes his own way. It costs the lives of a lot in his squad. Still he does redeem himself like Cagney in the end. This is maybe the only film in which McQueen's rebel persona worked against his character. Still it's an interesting and moving performance he gives.Look also for good performances from the rest of the cast that includes Harry Guardino Bobby Darin Nick Adams Mike Kellin and Bob Newhart as other soldiers on the dirty detail.The film credits say 'introducing Bob Newhart' and he provides what little comedy there is. After the Parker platoon gets the assignment to hold on their assigned piece of real estate Newhart comes driving up in a jeep loaded with typewriters. He's a clerktypist at division headquarters and it seems as though he made a wrong turn. Never mind because Guardino and Parker commandeer him and his jeep.Which sets up one of his routines from his early standup act. Newhart used to work with a telephone and he's asked to do so here for the benefit of a German microphone planted on the American line. It actually works very well into the fabric of the plot.Hell is for Heroes is one tough and gritty war drama the kind of film that a generation later Steven Spielberg would get all kinds of acclaim for Saving Private Ryan. For war picture fans this is a must.".

Both films involve a very small group of American soldiers who are holding out against a larger enemy force and as a result it's a very tense and claustrophobic film. Unlike STEEL HELMET this is set in WWII and has a lot of stars and soontobe stars such as Steve McQueen James Coburn Bobby Darin Bob Newhart and Harry Guardinothough at the time none of them were big stars.A group of only six guys are given the task of filling in where a hundred soldiers had been the day before. The problem is that the Germans are just across the battlefield and the Americans have to try and convince the enemy that there are a lot more than just the six guys. So they use a variety of ruses to try to keep the Germans at bayultimately culminating in an insane attack against a heavily defended pillbox. When this fails the rather surly and antisocial McQueen decides to try it again....and practically alone.Overall it's an incredibly tense film and one with a lot of realismperhaps too much for some my wife got pretty upset during one of the bloodier scenes. The acting and direction are very goodin particular Steve McQueen did an excellent job following the first abortive attackshowing a lot of the effects of exhaustion and fear. However the whole court martial scene following this was a bit sillyit seemed excessive and hard to believe for the Commanding Officer to respond to this brave action this wayor at least it seemed this way to me. Also the film towards the end tended to use too much stock footagea bit of a minus in an otherwise good film. But at least it did end on a very tough and tense notea definite plus.".

	schema:headline " Thoughtprovoking and nailbiting war film with an allstarcast and powerful direction";
	schema:reviewBody "WWII drama film dealing with a frontline American infantry squad as they battled their way across Europe . This movie's opening prologue is represented by segments of a speech by President John F. Kennedy . A single maneuver by a squad of GIs in retaliation against the force of the German Siegfried line. While most of the men withdraw from their positions taking on a German pillbox at the far side of a minefield half a dozen men are left to protect a wide front. By various ruses they manage to convince the Germans that a large force is still holding the position by pretending they are more powerful and larger that they really are . As the small squadron is forced to hold off a German attack suffering several dangers  risks and deaths . Reese joins a group of weary GIs unexpectedly ordered back into the line Siegfried and when the main platoon returns he is threatened with courtmartial .World War II film where the drama centers around the diverse characters and on the attack about a welldefensed pillbox . With mudsplattered realism the show offered character studies of men striving to maintain their own humanity  and heroism in the midst of a world torn by war . Impressive as well as surprising climax final  plenty of action and intensity . Very good acting by Steve McQueen as a degraded soldier who leads two of the men in an unauthorized and unsuccessful attack . Steve McQueen did not socialize with the rest of cast because his character was antisocial and alienated himself from the rest of the squad . In fact  a columnist visiting the set commented on Steve McQueen's irascible temperament by noting that McQueen seemed to be his own worst enemy. Furthermore  Steve McQueen and Bobby Darin did not get along during filming . Support cast is frankly excellent such as Fess Parker as Sgt. Pike  Harry Guardino as Sgt. Larkin  James Coburn as Cpl. Henshaw  Nick Adams as Homer Janeczek  Mike Kellin as Pvt. Kolinsky and a young Bob Newhart's featurefilm debut as Pvt. Driscoll who even interpolates a variation on one of his phone monologues into the tale . Director Don Siegel did not want to shoot the scene where Bob Newhart's character has a fake telephone conversation with headquarters to fool the Germans listening through a microphone planted in the US bunker believing that it had no place in the story  he was overruled by the studio however .Screenwriter Robert Pirosh was originally set to direct the film but after repeated clashes with star Steve McQueen he was replaced with Don Siegel  Pirosh's script featured many blackly comedic scenes but most of them were not filmed as Siegel wanted to make the film more dramatic. Robert Pirosh was a Master Sergeant during World War II serving with the 320th Regiment 35th Division. He fought in the Battle of the Bulge at Ardennes and in the Rhineland. He commanded a unit in Bastogne during the Battle of the Bulge was awarded a Bronze Star.

	onyx:emotionText "WWII drama film dealing with a frontline American infantry squad as they battled their way across Europe . This movie's opening prologue is represented by segments of a speech by President John F. Kennedy . A single maneuver by a squad of GIs in retaliation against the force of the German Siegfried line. While most of the men withdraw from their positions taking on a German pillbox at the far side of a minefield half a dozen men are left to protect a wide front. By various ruses they manage to convince the Germans that a large force is still holding the position by pretending they are more powerful and larger that they really are . As the small squadron is forced to hold off a German attack suffering several dangers  risks and deaths . Reese joins a group of weary GIs unexpectedly ordered back into the line Siegfried and when the main platoon returns he is threatened with courtmartial .World War II film where the drama centers around the diverse characters and on the attack about a welldefensed pillbox . With mudsplattered realism the show offered character studies of men striving to maintain their own humanity  and heroism in the midst of a world torn by war . Impressive as well as surprising climax final  plenty of action and intensity . Very good acting by Steve McQueen as a degraded soldier who leads two of the men in an unauthorized and unsuccessful attack . Steve McQueen did not socialize with the rest of cast because his character was antisocial and alienated himself from the rest of the squad . In fact  a columnist visiting the set commented on Steve McQueen's irascible temperament by noting that McQueen seemed to be his own worst enemy. Furthermore  Steve McQueen and Bobby Darin did not get along during filming . Support cast is frankly excellent such as Fess Parker as Sgt. Pike  Harry Guardino as Sgt. Larkin  James Coburn as Cpl. Henshaw  Nick Adams as Homer Janeczek  Mike Kellin as Pvt. Kolinsky and a young Bob Newhart's featurefilm debut as Pvt. Driscoll who even interpolates a variation on one of his phone monologues into the tale . Director Don Siegel did not want to shoot the scene where Bob Newhart's character has a fake telephone conversation with headquarters to fool the Germans listening through a microphone planted in the US bunker believing that it had no place in the story  he was overruled by the studio however .Screenwriter Robert Pirosh was originally set to direct the film but after repeated clashes with star Steve McQueen he was replaced with Don Siegel  Pirosh's script featured many blackly comedic scenes but most of them were not filmed as Siegel wanted to make the film more dramatic. Robert Pirosh was a Master Sergeant during World War II serving with the 320th Regiment 35th Division. He fought in the Battle of the Bulge at Ardennes and in the Rhineland. He commanded a unit in Bastogne during the Battle of the Bulge was awarded a Bronze Star. Pirosh directed a classic war film titled Go for brokeand wrote Battleground  A Gathering of Eagles and CombatTV series . The motion picture was well directed by Donald Siegel . His first feature as a director was 1946's The Verdict 1946. He made his reputation in the early and mid'50s with a series of tightly made expertly crafted tough but intelligent B pictures  among them  The Lineup 1958 Riot in Cell Block 11 1954 Invasion of the body snatchers 1956 then graduated to major A films in the 1960s and early 1970s.

	schema:reviewBody "HELL IS FOR HEROES 1962This better than expected war film is set during the fall of 1944 on the border between France and Germany. The cast is headlined by Steve McQueen with support from Fess Parker Bobby Darin Harry Guardino Nick Adams James Coburn Joe Hoover and Mike Kellin. An understrength platoon of American infantry have been assigned to hold a just captured section of the Siegfried Line. Most of the unit has been moved further up the line because of reports of a possible German counterattack. The men are spread out with gaps here and there in the lines. They need to make the German on the other side of the valley believe that the American position is being held in strength. They rig up a jeep to sound like heavy trucks arriving as well as setting up devices to make the German think there are patrols out in the brush. The Germans are not really fooled and send out a large patrol of their own. They rush the Americans who just barely fight off the Nazis. The jig looks like it is up. Now they need to hold on till the rest of their Company returns.They manage to hold on till the rest of the unit arrives and then join in on the attack on the German lines. In the middle of the German position is a big concrete pillbox. The blockhouse is spitting plenty of lead and knocking down the American infantry like bowling pins. It takes a mortally wounded Steve McQueen to silence the German pillbox when he blows it and himself to hell with a satchel charge. The attack then continues with most of the squad being killed. Fess Parker plays the Sgt in charge of the platoon with Harry Guardino next in charge. Bobby Darin James Coburn and Mike Kellin are soldiers in the squad. Nick Adams plays a Polish refuge who has attached himself to the group. McQueen is quite good here as the ex Sgt who has a slight over fondness for drink. It is always getting him in trouble when off the line. Funny man Bob Newhart makes his screen debut as a lost rear area private who gets drafted into the unit. The director here is Don Siegel. Siegel started off in the 30's as a second unit editor and director. He moved his way up the ladder and into the director's chair by 1946. He is best known for several excellent film noir such as THE VERDICT THE BIG STEAL PRIVATE HELL 36 RIOT IN CELL BLOCK 11 THE LINEUP and the brilliant INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS. His later work included DIRTY HARRY CHARLIE VARRICK COOGAN'S BLUFF TWO MULES FOR SISTER SARA and John Wayne's last film THE SHOOTIST. One time Oscar nominated Harold Lipstein handled the cinematography duties. The story was by two time Oscar nominated Go for Broke and one time winner Battleground Robert Pirosh. Pirosh a former Sgt in the US Army worked as screenwriter producer and director from 1935 to 1981. Pirosh was hired at first to also direct and produce the film but he walked away after trouble with McQueen. There was apparently plenty of bad feelings on the production. McQueen was upset over his fee and was less than friendly with his fellow cast mates and crew. The film's producers Paramount Pictures cut the production budget during filming resulting in director Siegel having to cut corners. Despite all the problems etc Siegel manages to deliver a first rate combat film".

	schema:headline " An uncompromising wellacted dramedy for mature audiences";
	schema:reviewBody "Bear Cub Cachorro has been shown at several film festivals since it was first released in its native Spain in early 2004. I saw the movie on Opening Night at the ImageOut Film Festival in Rochester NY. The nearcapacity crowd was very receptive to the film.The story about a gay man who finds himself taking care of his young nephew for an unexpectedly extended period has been done before in different variations About a Boy Three Men and a Baby television's Bachelor Father etc.. Compared with other movies Bear Cub stands out by not compromising the depiction of the main character's social life especially with the explicit and what will be a very controversial opening sequence. Note the opening scenes and a few other scenes were edited for general release in the U.S. I saw the unedited version at the film festival I attended. I'm happy of the decision by cowriterdirector Miguel Abaladejo with cowriter Salvador Garca Ruiz to present to the moviegoers a subculture of the gay population called Bears. It might open a few people's minds. Pedro the lead character wellplayed by Jos Luis Garca Prez and his circle of friends do not fit the dominant depiction of what gay men look like especially in movies bearded and husky. Another thing that impressed me was the performance of David Castillo. He plays Bernardo the precocious nephew who is mature way beyond his years but in one of the many plot twists that propel the film there are reasons why he is that way. I almost forgot to mention how funny and touching this film is. Bear Cub is a very wellbalanced dramedy. The comedy comes out of the unusual familial situation and when complications arise in the guise of Bernardo's estranged paternal grandmother Doa Teresa Empar Ferrer it made for a very compelling drama. The decision to change the aspect of the movie from just observing the characters to having some of the characters talk to the camera in the final 20 minutes was not a good idea. Despite that flaw I found Bear Cub to be a timely wellperformed and memorable film. P.S. I would bet a few dollars that a production company in Hollywood would be too cowardly to remake a film like this much less buy the rights to make the movie. The movie's honest depiction of a man having a social gay life without making value judgments might be too much for some viewers or for that matter some members of the Hollywood community to tolerate.".

In her attempts to denounce Pedro we discover the Bernardo already knows of his uncle's HIV status as well as Violeta's and Bernardo pleads with Pedro not to let Doa Teresa take him away. A compromise is reached and Bernardo is sent off to a coed school in Valencia.How all of these twists and turns resolve constitutes the surprising ending of this excellent film each of the characters is shown to be wholly threedimensional even Doa Teresa and the overriding importance of family and compassion and love rules the day. The ending is open ended allowing the viewer to select the way to conclude the story.Director and cowriter with Salvador Garca Ruiz Miguel Albaladejo is a master at finding the core of truth in each of his characters their individual life styles and the unfettered joy of living uncompromised lives. The cast is extraordinary Jos Luis Garca Prez is a natural actor David Castillo is completely believable as Bernardo and the remainder of the cast is outstanding. The original music by Nacho Canut and Olvido Gara is so in keeping with the tone of the film. Yes there are some consensual sex scenes in this film but they are treated with respect and decorum and without them the flavor of the film would be lacking. This is a refreshing film about the sanctity of love  and it just happens to be populated with one of the most lovable gay groups ever created! Highly recommended.Grady Harp".

I was pleasantly surprised that it avoided falling into predictability and that it kept the characters including the prudish grandmother threedimensional. In some ways her character is the most interestinglike Violeta and Pedro we want to hate her but ultimately she turns out to be neither truly evil nor fully irredeemablebut nothing in the plot forces us to come around to liking her either. I appreciated the fact that the movie's gay characters are bears and that this is largely unremarkable. Other reviewers commented on the frank sex scenes. These appear to have been cut from the movie in commercial releaseand the cuts were especially noticeable and choppy. They rendered at least a couple of scenes pointless. There is a little bit of irony in sitting in a theatre near the West Village in an audience that was probably 90 gay men watching a movie that focuses on a very sexually active gay man yet finding myself protected from witnessing the movie's sex scenes. For instance the opening scene which I understand from reading reviews and comments is fairly explicit simply opens with three men in bed together and Pedro telling the other two to hurry up because family is coming. The bathhouse scene shows Pedro and another man walking off together and then a very choppy edit finds us at the next scene. We do see some kissing and fullyclothed groping and Pedro and his friend from Paris rolling around in bed and later waking up and cuddling. I don't have a particular need to see erect penises at least not in movies but I have no idea what else I might have missed with the editing out of these scenes. And of course more to the point these are or were part of the movie whether they make some people uncomfortable or not.I don't knowperhaps these cuts may have been a necessary compromise to put the film in commercial release but it still sucks so to speak. I guess I'll have to wait for the release of the DVD to see the film in unexpurgated form. And maybe it'll include some cool outtakes too?no just kidding.".

	schema:headline " Bear cubs";
	schema:reviewBody "It appears to be a trend in the cinema by presenting the bear gay subculture. We already saw it in John Waters' Dirty Shame in the summer although it's not the main idea of that picture. Of course the John Waters' movie has nothing to do with Luis Miguel Albaladejo's superior film where we are presented with the Spanish version of this sub group of the gay culture where overweight men usually hairy and cuddly tend to get together in bars or other places where they can feel comfortable with one another.In a way it's a refreshing way to watch a film like this one that deals with that type of individuals as they are presented leading normal lives without any hangups or other moral problems. In fact the dialog is quite explicit as the people in the movie are not ashamed of their sexual preference and even those that aren't gay keep an open mind about what is going on with Pedro the man at the center of the story.We get to know Pedro and his circle of friends. They all are normal people and well adjusted. Pedro is a loving man facing the dilemma of being a role model for his nephew who has come into his life quite suddenly and without warning.

	onyx:emotionText "It appears to be a trend in the cinema by presenting the bear gay subculture. We already saw it in John Waters' Dirty Shame in the summer although it's not the main idea of that picture. Of course the John Waters' movie has nothing to do with Luis Miguel Albaladejo's superior film where we are presented with the Spanish version of this sub group of the gay culture where overweight men usually hairy and cuddly tend to get together in bars or other places where they can feel comfortable with one another.In a way it's a refreshing way to watch a film like this one that deals with that type of individuals as they are presented leading normal lives without any hangups or other moral problems. In fact the dialog is quite explicit as the people in the movie are not ashamed of their sexual preference and even those that aren't gay keep an open mind about what is going on with Pedro the man at the center of the story.We get to know Pedro and his circle of friends. They all are normal people and well adjusted. Pedro is a loving man facing the dilemma of being a role model for his nephew who has come into his life quite suddenly and without warning. Bernardo the young boy is wiser for his years as we get to know him better. This youngster while being curious about his uncle's love life is never a brat as he takes everything in stride.The film is a lot of fun for those that will watch it with open eyes. They will be rewarded to a fun time with a touch of reality at the end.";

	schema:reviewBody "Directed by the veteran gay indie filmmaker Luis Miguel Albaladejo and cowritten by Luis Miguel Albaladejo and Salvador Garcia Ruiz based on Albaladejo's 1996 short film of the same name this motion picture is at its heart a pretty commonlyused story A perpetual adolescent Pedro finds himself taking care of his sister's precocious son Bernardo. Pedro has to make a number of adjustments in his life in order to be a good parent. There are the standard humorous scenes of Pedro being an archprude when it comes to drugs and sex followed the standard humorous scenes of a tooadult Bernardo discussing drugs and sex. Soon a nasty relative Bernardo's fraternal grandmother enters the picture uncovers Pedro's nonconformist lifestyle and threatens to have Bernardo taken away. Bernardo is removed from Pedro's life Pedro and Bernardo suffer heavily the grandmother realizes she's done something horrible and by the end of the film Bernardo is back with Pedro.Pretty standard stuff eh? But sometimes the most standard plot elements can be transcended by terrific writing and acting.One key to the film is Jose Luis Garcia Perez Pedro a 32yearold relative newcomer to acting. On screen in almost every scene he handles his gentle moments with Bernardo with emotion empathy and naturalness. This is not to say that Garcia Perez is by any means perfect in the role. Pedro is written as a hothead and Garcia Perez comes off cruel and unnecessarily vicious when he is required to be angry. Additionally the script makes Pedro's change from sexhungry drugtaking libertine to responsible loving adult seem relatively smooth and effortless.The second key is David Castillo the stunning young actor making his featurefilm debut as the nineyearold Bernardo. Castillo is given a difficult task Bernardo cannot be the typical precocious American brainchild e.g. Macaulay Culkin in Home Alone or Dakota Fanning in Uptown Girls who is too smarmy too brainy and too adult. It would blow the whole feel of the film. And he's not  which is why this film works. Despite Bernardo's worldliness he's still just a scared kid. His fear of leaving his mother Violeta played with breezy but superficial wackiness by Elvira Lindo is palpable  and a bit out of character until the audience later realizes that Bernardo's father died from a drug overdose and that his mother is an addict as well. Watch closely Throughout the film Bernardo keeps touching the watch his mother gave him almost as if it were a worrybead.It's this very delicate subtle acting that really helps raise the film into the realm of good cinema.The film has its comic moments it is marketed as a comedy. But it is the underlying grim subtheme of parenting vs. gay lifestyle that holds the film together. This isn't just a modern twist on the old tale either. In a lesser film the gay elements would simply have been layered on top and never made an essential part of the plot. But in Bear Cub Cachorro these elements are key to the narrative and this makes the film much more of a message picture than at first blush.It is not simply that Pedro enjoys having threeways the film opens with a graphic sex scene that includes a shot of an erect penis a daily doobie or that he haunts underpasses for public sex. The film directly challenges the audience's expectations that such behavior is normal and moral. When one of Pedro's friends rolls a joint in front of Bernardo Pedro comically lashes out at him. Bernardo comically replies that he knows how to roll a joint because his mother taught him. It's funny but a tooeasy laugh. Later however the audience is confronted with the stark reality that drug use is grounds for losing custody of one's child. What is acceptable behavior in the gay community is not acceptable outside that community.In another scene Pedro is given a night off by his friends. He has sex in public with a stranger. Unfortunately Bernardo's fraternal grandmother Dona Teresa played with lusty prudishness by the fantastic Empar Ferrer has set a private detective on Pedro's tail. He photographs the men having sex and Dona Teresa uses this against Pedro. Once more the promiscuity admired and accepted in the gay community is shown to be in direct contravention of the larger society's moral  and more importantly legal  standards.When even the incriminating photographs do not move Pedro to give up custody of Bernardo Dona Teresa then obtains Pedro's medical records. We learn Pedro is HIVpositive and that his lover Eduardo died of AIDS five years ago. Unfortunately Pedro  who is a doctor  has never told his patients that he his HIVpositive. Dona Teresa threatens to disclose this fact unless she obtains primary custody of Bernardo. Once more the audience must confront an ugly truth HIV and AIDS are accepted as normal in the gay community. But outside that community HIV is threatening and the source of fearmongering. Pedro for his part knows this and hid the truth about his seroconversion status from his patients.Although it is largely unremarked upon by the film Pedro decides to protect himself by giving up Bernardo rather than seeing his medical practice destroyed and his patients sue him for distress.But this is where Bear Cub Cachorro largely falls apart. Typically Bernardo suffers heavily for his change in custody. His grandmother sends him off to a boarding school that teaches conservative social mores and English as a second language. There Bernardo wilts  lonely depressed abandoned. Pedro too enters a lengthy depression and seeks solace in greater amounts of meaningless sex this is depicted as public sex as if public sex was essentially meaningless  a bit of moralizing the film could have done without. His depression causes health problems for Pedro and he gets pneumonia. Dona Teresa tries to drive a wedge between Bernardo and Pedro by telling Bernardo that Pedro is dying.The one redeeming quality of the final 20 minutes of the film is Bernardo's reaction to Dona Teresa's cruel lies. Bernardo angrily tells her that he already knew that Pedro had HIV. His mother had it and his mother told him that Uncle Pedro had it. Indeed Bernardo was born with the HIV antibody in his system and drugs and homeopathic medicine eliminated the antibody after a few years.Dona Teresa is shocked. But in a way this scene represents the progressive loving lifeaffirming freelove community that Violeta and Pedro were part of striking back at the moralistic prudish legalism represented by Dona Teresa. When no one has secrets no one can be hurt. Bernardo sees Dona Teresa's cruelty for what it is and he hates her for it. Dona Teresa loses Bernardo's love forever.This scene is the only thing holding the final moments of the film together. It is almost as if the writers didn't know how to end the story. The typical feelgood conclusion would have Dona Teresa admitting her error or dying and Bernardo returning to the loving arms of his uncle Pedro. But in attempting to evade that trite trap the writers don't seem to know where to go.Part of their answer is to engage in a sudden bit of lessons learned that doesn't really fit in the film. There is a sudden shift in perspective that they use to accomplish this. Instead of a thirdperson perspective which has been used for the previous 115 minutes the filmmakers adopt a firstperson narrative each character talking to the camera reading aloud letters they have written to other characters. The narrative shift is partly intended to make time pass more swiftly three years pass in the final 15 minutes. It also permits each character to admit their faults notably Violeta  who disappeared from 90 percent of the movie only to return awkwardly at the end.Despite this shift the film never quite manages to avoid the pat ending. Dona Teresa does die  albeit after torturing Bernardo for four years. Bernardo weeps for his grandmother whom he has finally come to love although it's impossible to see how that happened. Pedro weeps for the child that might have been for Bernardo has become less progressive in many ways although apparently a bisexual. And off Bernardo and Pedro go...to where and to what is unclear. Did Pedro win custody of Bernardo again?It is this unsatisfying conclusion to the film that is the pictures largest fault. True there are other problems. Dona Teresa obviously is a scheming bitch who will stop at nothing including seducing an elementary school teacher to spy on Violeta's child despite legal orders for Dona Teresa to keep away from him to be with her grandson. Yet Pedro seems ignorant of this and does not realize that Dona Teresa may well try to blackmail him in order to obtain custody of the boy. For all his awareness of how his HIV status could harm him Pedro doesn't seem aware that his drug use and promiscuity could be used against him. And so much of the film's custodybattle could have been moot had Pedro simply obtained a custody agreement from his imprisoned sister.However these problems are obvious only in retrospect. The film does a superb job of crafting a believable world that makes sense of sneaking important issues into the plot without being obvious or preachy about it and in eliciting fine performances out of the key actors that create moving honest portrayals of human beings in conflict.I recommend it.".

The most interesting thing about this movie is even most of the main movie characters are gay and not particularly beautiful they are really bears the effect of the movie is really intended to cause effects on straight people. I even imagine that many gay people will even feel offended by vicious lifestyle of this people.Pedro is a middle age middle class dentist. He is really a big gay bear far from the styled all muscle gay community you can see on South Beach. Unexpected his drug addict and dealer sister leave his 8 year son Bernardo to his care she is traveling to India for business for two weeks with his boyfriend.Pedro gentle but selfcentered person does his best to keep the kid happy.The kid knows perfectly well about his uncle homosexuality his mother even thinks that the kid is homosexual too but still has to change some of his habits like smoking joints in front of the kid or having sex in his bedroom.This is a European movie so dialogs and situation are FAAAAAAAAAAAR from the repressed American minds. When a friend try to smoke a joint in front of the kid Pedro stop him but the kid offers to prepare it himself as he usually does for his mother and adoptive father.Out of nowhere the kid's grandmother appears. She is a very depressed old but no to old woman whose son Bernardo's father died for drug and aids and she is blaming Bernardo's mother for that. The kid of course wants nothing with her and refuse even to go out.The relation between them growth from the obligation to real caring of the kid. That does no means Pedro lifestyle completely changes. He refuses a steady relation ship with his French boyfriend  pilot. He embarks in quick sexual encounters in clubs andor dark streets there are a few strong sexual scenes here so prepare to feel offended. In addition he does joints and cocaine with his friends. After a few days Bernardo's mother is caught with drugs and put in jail. The grandmother will fight for the kid custody using Pedro's lifestyle against him.The characters are perfectly crafted. There are not bad people or saints. Probably Bernardo's selfish mother is worse than anybody else is. The grandmother is portrayed as a sad woman fighting to recover her only left family. The battle custody ends in the only possible 'actual moral rules permit' however there are no big trials or lawyers arguments. Things get resolved as life out of court but the movie does not end there but keep going for a few more years towards a perfect and realistic ending.Due to some strong sexual scenes my wife was completely horrified in certain moments but most important for the surprising dialogs and situations this movie will get an NC17 without any doubt. It will be a pity to cut all this doing so will diminished the effect the director wanted. Please open your mind close your eyes sometimes and try to see this movie you will not regret it...".

	schema:reviewBody "BEAR CUB introduces many to the concept of the nontraditional gay male the hairy and chunky variety. It also artfully presents reallife situations for the characters. The relationship between a 'bear' uncle and his young nephew is the main focus but the film also embraces the concept of male to male relationships sexual and otherwise HIV and extended families. It manages to do all this without becoming maudlin or overly busy. The storytelling aspects of BEAR CUB are sharply honed. The performances are also quite good especially from the central figures. There is however a somewhat lethargic feeling to the proceedings as well. I'm not sure if it is the unremarkable scoring and editing but the film feels every bit it's 100 minutes. The characters are sometimes painfully earnest and the tone tips towards the selfimportant a bit too often. Perhaps it was reading the 'Director's Message' about the film that predisposed me toward this view. Also the pacing of the movie feels a bit too 'even keel'  lacking a sense of momentum to carry us through to the final credits. The DVD 'extra scenes' reveal a highly comic scene at the film's core that might have pepped things up a bit. Whether it was excised for length or sexual content is not made clear. For those who think of Smokey and Yogi at the mention of 'bears' this film will be a real eyeopener. For the bear community it is at least a step or two forward.".

This one shows a different aspect of gay life someone who is described as a bear and who lives in the old part of Madrid which coincidentally is the gay area of Chueca and who is HIV but that is not an impediment for him to carry on with normal life until he is challenged about it by lawyers.

The unexpectedly orphaned child finds a surrogate father within the very active social life of his gay uncle portrayed brilliantly by Jos Luis Garca Prez.

There are few films around that use 'bears' in films. Most ofthe ones I've seen are rather poor for example the French film'Dancing' AKA Ballroom. People that are gay are portrayed sympathetically though the moreexplicit sexual shots may shock or upset some people. They would beunaffected by a woman being raped but get uncomfortable at a bit ofconsensual gay sex? How very strange that seems to me. Oh and no womangets raped in this film. It isn't that type of film. The plot doesn't degenerate into trite clichs. You don't haveeverything pulled together in a tidy package at the end  but it doeshave a very good ending  and people aren't portrayed as simply goodand bad. This is a film that you don't have to be gay to see. A strong story andgood acting make this a very appealing film.  NB What is a 'bear'? Well the definition varies depending on whomyou ask. Some believe it means you are large and furry like a bear.Others believe it means you are more natural in the way you keep yourbody Rather than a weight lifting beauty obsessed person that visitsthe gym between meals you simply get on with your life. This can meanthat you may appear somewhat larger than others but you don't care. Iprefer the later definition.".

While I am free to not have unsafe sex I suspect that many people have unsafe sex without much consideration for the ramifications. I wish that the movie had been more responsible in its portrayal of an HIV person having sex.RANDOM THOUGHTS I know it's just a movie but how sad is it in life when people are blinded by their good intentions like the estranged grandmother. I wonder if people like that whose children become involved with drugs for example think that they as the parent had nothing to do with it. These are the same people who then want to impart their parenting skills and decisionmaking on their grandchildren as if trying the same crap on the next generation will lead to different results. Again I understand that it was just a movie but in the end did she or do people like that really ever get what they want. What benefit exactly did she take with her to the grave? I enjoyed how this film developed slowly revealing its secrets and doing so with an honesty and sincerity rarely seen in film especially films with gay themes. Perhaps it's just rarely seen in American cinema? Even though I am not into Bears subunit of gay culture where the men a more fat than fit more sloppy than stylish etc. it is nice to see them portrayed in non stereotypical ways ways that make them attractive and engaging as people versus sexual beings not to your liking. I would imagine that non gays who venture out of their comfort zone to see this movie might be surprised at the similarities between gays and straights with respect to family friends and love. Gay sex scenes aside I would recommend this movie to mature audiences who would like to see a tender portrayal of gay love casual sex casual intimacy bond between friends familial conflict intergenerational bonding and living with HIV.

It's just not my scene but we do see Pedro move away from them throughout the film.All in all a wonderful effort by writerdirector Miguel Albaladejo. The principal cast is terrific here led by Jose Luis Garcia Perez as Pedro and David Castillo as Bernardo. What a treat! Recommended!".

Surely she saw Tassie Cameron's script as just another runofthemill romantic comedy replete with the clichd love triangle and tired stereotypes.Perhaps Graham needs a new agent  especially after the Emily's Reasons Why Not debacle. She has some good films on her resume Bowfinger 1999 Boogie Nights 1997 Two Girls and a Guy 1997 The Ballad of Little Jo 1993 and Drugstore Cowboy 1989. But the roles that stand out are Rollergirl and Felicity Shagwell and it's the clunkers that seem to define her  Lost in Space 1998 Say It Ain't So 2001 and Killing Me Softly 2002. Now add Cake to the mix.Cameron and director Nisha Ganatra don't even bother masking their film's hackneyed plot. Which is a shame because they have a talented cast. There's Graham Taye Diggs Cheryl Hines Sandra Oh who's terrific on TV's Grey's Anatomy and Sarah Chalke who knows what it's like to do genuinely funny comedy on TV's Scrubs which for my money is the best halfhour on TV.Graham much like Roberts isn't a masterful dramatic actress. Her turn as English hooker Mary Kelly in From Hell 2001 was admirable albeit miscast. But Graham clearly knows how to play comedy. She just needs good material. Her nineepisode stint as Dr. Molly Clock on Scrubs proved as much.There's never a moment in Cake when you think Oh this is different. Cameron's script is so atrociously lazy that she never bothers to include even the slightest of surprises. Poor Graham flays about buoyantly in a valiant yet futile attempt to elicit laughs out of this bad script.In Cake she's Pippa McGee a spunky carefree travel writer suddenly forced to take over her dad's magazine  a bridal periodical. There's some humor in the decor of the magazine's offices as this sprightly independent feminist tries to handle things. But the story is so clunky and her two love interest so unreal and dull there's not even a modicum of sense to this whole enterprise. Pippa spends such little time with the men that it's asking a lot of us to believe either would work.As much fun as it is to see the luminescent Graham bounce around she certainly deserves better than this mediocre fare.".

	schema:headline " Pornography for Sorority Freshmen...";
	schema:reviewBody "Heather Graham stars in this pretty pink lace bow of a movie alternately flashing her pearly white smile and puppy dog eyes from scene to scene. One gets the feeling that watching the straighttoDVD release with you are thousands of sorority girls braiding each other's hair while wearing fluffy animal slippers and pretending to cry.Graham plays Pippa McGee a movie name if there ever was one a free spirit slut with a penchant for impulsive decisions one night stands and globe hopping adventures inability to commit. We get the prerequisite explanations for her issues A mother who died when she was a teenager A distant father who is too hard on her A group of friends who have an unspoken pact to remain independent and strong without the help of a man.Pippa returns from one of her freelance adventure trips to find her father on the verge of a heartattack and in need of someone to help run one of his magazines... Surprise surprise... It is a bridal magazine named 'Wedding Bells'. And isn't that just the dream job for girls who wear pink pajamas? Needless to say the magazine causes her problems being that she stands for everything that the magazine condemns. Her first issue is an unqualified disaster.Then as per screen writing 101 she meets two guys who will inevitably form the other two corners of the film's love triangle. Taye Diggs plays the studly photographer who shares Pippa's love for noncommittal sex and fun. David Sutcliffe plays the straightlaced business man who wants more from Pippa than a quickie in the hottub.I am one of the biggest romantics you'll meet but even I have nothing but respect for singles who feel that marriage is a ludicrous institution that is either ultimately doomed to fail or descend into a comfortable acceptance of routine and safe boredom. This film seems to be championing the notion that women shouldn't feel the need to 'find a man' in order to feel complete. But the final act pulls the rug from under that notion and the movie fizzles into a standard romcom riddled with You Go Girlfriend scenes and cheesy bgrade love songs.Now... I think that Heather Graham is utterly underrated as an actress because of a few choice roles as the quintessential ditzy blonde with big boobs. But she has actually been far better than people give her credit for in films like Boogie Nights Two Girls  a Guy Sidewalks of New York Swingers  The Guru. She is quite easily capable of carrying a film with energy and charisma. She is even good in this fluffy film despite having little to work with in terms of a script.I liked the pace of the film. I thought Heather was fun to watch. The romances are cutesy if not substantive. The 'friends' are amusing from time to time led by the always refreshing Sandra Oh Sideways and Sarah Chalke Scrubs. Diggs and Sutcliffe are nice counterpoints to one another. And the overall production was colorfully distracting enough to merit a passable grade. But there isn't anything here to really chew on... well hardly anything. Cake is a highschool cheerleader's wet dream of what life might become. I say we let her have that dream before she gets knocked up by the college senior who will dump her leaving her to drop out of school as a single mom applying for a job at Taco Bell.TC Candler IndependentCritics.com".

	onyx:emotionText "Heather Graham stars in this pretty pink lace bow of a movie alternately flashing her pearly white smile and puppy dog eyes from scene to scene. One gets the feeling that watching the straighttoDVD release with you are thousands of sorority girls braiding each other's hair while wearing fluffy animal slippers and pretending to cry.Graham plays Pippa McGee a movie name if there ever was one a free spirit slut with a penchant for impulsive decisions one night stands and globe hopping adventures inability to commit. We get the prerequisite explanations for her issues A mother who died when she was a teenager A distant father who is too hard on her A group of friends who have an unspoken pact to remain independent and strong without the help of a man.Pippa returns from one of her freelance adventure trips to find her father on the verge of a heartattack and in need of someone to help run one of his magazines... Surprise surprise... It is a bridal magazine named 'Wedding Bells'. And isn't that just the dream job for girls who wear pink pajamas? Needless to say the magazine causes her problems being that she stands for everything that the magazine condemns. Her first issue is an unqualified disaster.Then as per screen writing 101 she meets two guys who will inevitably form the other two corners of the film's love triangle. Taye Diggs plays the studly photographer who shares Pippa's love for noncommittal sex and fun. David Sutcliffe plays the straightlaced business man who wants more from Pippa than a quickie in the hottub.I am one of the biggest romantics you'll meet but even I have nothing but respect for singles who feel that marriage is a ludicrous institution that is either ultimately doomed to fail or descend into a comfortable acceptance of routine and safe boredom. This film seems to be championing the notion that women shouldn't feel the need to 'find a man' in order to feel complete. But the final act pulls the rug from under that notion and the movie fizzles into a standard romcom riddled with You Go Girlfriend scenes and cheesy bgrade love songs.Now...

This woman doesn't believe in settling down or getting married and what is the magazine about? Wedding bells.

Absent father uptight rival at the magazine helpful male gay assistant danger the magazine will be closed or taken over etc. Each stereotype was there but not fully developed nor the actors appealing enough to make you accept the stereotype.The main male lead was far too good to be real sensitive helpful caring honest patient romantic. He was the ideal boyfriend. I don't remember his name but it should have been Prince Charming. He was so good I wondered why he was interested in Heather Graham's character. I certainly wasn't interested in her as she seemed too neurotic and self centered. After each plot point would keep the two main characters apart I thought for the guy Good you are better off. Go find someone else.I appreciate that none of the men in the movie were the typical male movie jerks. But the movie went overboard in making everyone nice. The only tension was a result of misunderstandings.And the ending? Give me a break.I did like the music selections. However I really wished most of the soundtrack was quieter and in the background. A number of times I had trouble hearing what the lead characters were saying.Net result if you are going to watch it see it with your 20ssomething female friends.

Im not sure why i watched this film as ratings were pretty low and it certainly didn't appeal to me but i always like to give a film a chance to respond to its critics and its always good to see it for yourself and then make a judgement.

One of dad's publications is Wedding Bells an advice rag for those who intend to walk down the aisle in the near future. Pippa's mother was once involved with this particular magazine but she passed away when her daughter was but 13. After her mother's death Pippa developed many of her freespirited ways including her personal rejection of a happily ever after marriage. Instead Pippa covers such events as Spain's running of the bulls and her only romantic encounters are of the very shortlived variety. A close friend Sandra Oh helps the freelancer through life's rough moments. But after her father suffers a heart attack Pippa decides to help him out by becoming the new editor of Wedding Bells. This displeases most of the staff including a sales director Roxanne Cheryl Hines and a handsome financial adviser Ian David Sutcliffe. Yet although Pippa's first efforts fail badly she learns quickly from her mistakes and is determined to succeed. She may even discover some lessons in love and marriage that she has previously dismissed as nonsense. Will there be a rosecolored future for our Pippa and her magazine? This is a slight but satisfying romcom for those insatiable fans of the genre. Graham excels in her role as the vagabond beauty who explores new truths about her own existence while Sutcliffe is a charming attractive foil to Pippa's flighty personality. Oh Hinds Taye Diggs and others also offer fine turns as the supporting cast members. The scenery is quite nice as are the costumes and production values. As for the story it takes a lot of twists and turns sometimes to excess but ends up tying ups its loose ends nicely. If you are not a fan of romantic comedy this one will probably have you biting your fingernails. But for those who adore those funny tales of love this one will take the cake for you.".

The fact that this movie was a BrookwellMcNamara Production a staple of the cable network that made her famous may be another obstacle from that typecasting. Make no mistake though  Hilary Duff IS a talented actress and singerin spite of corporate punk pretensions and even with this formulaic material she proves it. But the way things are looking now she couldn't break out of the Disney universe if she did hardcore pornography.Terri FletcherDuff sings in a local church chorus and for her own personal enjoyment. She also thinks her singing can make her a star and so does her brother PaulJason Ritter who secretly recommends her for a scholarship to a school for the performing arts in Los Angeles. But her fatherDavid Keith wants her to stay at home and wait tables at the family diner. After she and her brother sneak out to go to a concert one night some drunk driver plows into them on the way home. Her brother dies she survives and is left with crippling flashbacks and survivor's guilt. But just when she thinks she's going to have to spend the rest of her life at the bottom of the barrel along comes that scholarship to the performing arts school she didn't even know she entered. Of course the only reason she doesn't want to go is because she's afraid to face the wrath of Dad so MomRita Wilson and Aunt NinaRebecca De Mornay tell Daddy she's going to spend time with her aunt while smuggling her off to that school. And the rest of the movie involves Terri trying to make friends in the big city coverup her lie to her father and deal with her own fear of bright lights courtesy of that random drunk driver.Too much about this movie is predictable The overbearing father sympathetic avantgarde artistic aunt the tragic car wreck the boyfriend with an exgirlfriend who won't let gowho Terri catches putting the moves on and thinks is unfaithful to her and yes even the triumphant concert at the end. Having said all that I must reiterate that I don't want my criticism of this movie to be interpreted as another Duffbashing tirade. Because regardless of the cookiecutter plot line Duff is still outstanding. Yes she's a better actress than a singer but both of these aspects of her are far superior to the movie. And if you DON'T believe she can play anyone else but Lizzie McGuire you should've seen her in a highly publicized episode of Joan of Arcadia from the Spring of 2005. So while it's nowhere near the fluffpiece that her first big series was it makes you wish there were more parts out there that are better for her.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hilary Duff stars as Terri Fletcher a 16yearold anxious to explore her musical talent at a performing arts academy in L.A. for the summer. After a little persuasion she makes it there and the movie is more or less about her exploits therein.The film starts well the Three Days Grace concert helps set the musical tone for the movie. That was an unexpected surprise although I suppose I'm partially biased since I like the band.A beautiful performance by Hilary Duff. I am more and more impressed with her with every movie I see her in. She brought me to tears twice in the first twenty minutes of the movie. I was impressed by the colorful array of teens at the school even if they were chosen primarily to make it believable that they're in L.A. I appreciated that none of the teens were written to fulfill any particular stereotype and all seemed like real people for stereotypes are a sore spot for me as my teen years were not all that long ago. I loved the scenes with Denise playing the violin again very refreshing and stylistic. John Corbett turns in a innovative performance as a progressive music teacher breathing a little more life into the film.The direction really helps to further the movie along as it is pretty anticlimatic. The 'unwanted kiss' was a bit predictable however an element of predictability is generally assumed in movies of this persuasion. The makeout scene was completely unnecessary and should've been cut.And it should be noted that the film is more or less like a Crossroads 2000 for a slightly younger generation but despite that it still maintains its own life.I absolutely love the last song in the filmthat was the perfect song for the theme of the movie. And I don't care what anyone says Hilary Duff is a true performer even if she isn't that great of a singer. She just always has this glow about her and no matter how I feel seeing her perform always makes me smile and that's something to be commended.VERDICT Very enjoyable musical film despite its predictability. Recommended to anyone with kids who's young at heart who likes Hilary Duff or just needs a good smile but be forewarnedyou might get a little tearyeyed before that smile reaches your lips.6.5 out of 10.0".

Who do we cast as the lead? Um Hillary Duff? You're kidding me right? Anyone who can buy into the premise of Hillary Duff as a singing prodigy needs to watch some American Idol reruns and realize that Duff who can barely carry a tune would probably have not even made it to Hollywood. She has made millions of dollars by pretending to act and sing in order to market her cuteness and general likability which has been eaten up by her core fanbase of seven to twelveyearold girls. The problem with Raise Your Voice lies in the very serious dramatic storyline crafted by writers Mitch Rotter and Sam Schreiber. It's just too serious for Duff's fanbase and she doesn't possess the acting ability to make it believable for the rest of us.To their credit Rotter and Schreiber along with director Sean McNamara did a very skillful job in putting together an engaging drama. Some elements of the movie were brilliant such as Terri's reaction to bright light in her eyes after the accident. The movie was just bogged down by its bungling cast of actors. The only truly good performances were by some of the supporting cast members such as John Corbett David Keith and Rita Wilson. Johnny Lewis was a terrific comic relief but his character's main story  a romance with an uptight virtuosic pianist named Sloane  seems to fit a more typical gigglesandgoodtimes Hillary Duff movie. Duff's abysmal singing only made McNamara's job even more difficult and you can actually hear the pitch correction on her voice at some points of the movie which makes everything seem that much more ridiculous. And something that especially bothered me was Jay's Oliver James guitarplaying during the scholarship performance. There was absolutely no rhythm to it at all.Overall it's still a cute movie but it could have been so much better.".

Never mind that we all knew Hilary would be a great singer and how it was portrayed. So what? I enjoyed the storyline and was caught by surprise on the tragedy. Note in the end the prize went to her friend and it was a great moment.I guess I just enjoy a great movie when I see it!".

	schema:reviewBody "My wife convinced me to bring this fluff little movie home and to tell you the truth I was disappointed for not so obvious reasons. Granted this was just another teenqueen Duff vehicle that runs on sugar and not gas thus it doesn't get very far...SPOILERS however I didn't think it was appropriate for the movie to take the tack that she lied to her father David Keith to get into the summer program then continue to lie to him to stay in it...then the aunt character played by Rebecca DeMornay conspired with the the mom Rita Wilson character to continue the lie against the father. According to the movie the ends justifies the means. This is not a great message to teach the teens and preteens that it's OK for a kid to lie to their parents and that it's OK for a wife to lie to her husband. No wonder this movie bombed like it did...well...there are other reasons for it's failure. I also didn't buy into the setup of the school when stated that if you get caught doing things you're not supposed to do i.e. drinking etc. you will be dismissed. Then the Jay character Hillary's on screen boyfriend proceeds to go out drinking after Hillary walked in on him and another girl kissing...there are no negative consequences for him. I would have liked to see Duff take a harder stance with the issue especially in light of the fact that her brother was killed by a drunk driver. The wrong message is put forth in that it's OK to drink when you're underage to cope with your problems and the only consequence is spending the night on the roof with Hillary Duff. Puhleeeeeeeze! This movie is horrible for kids today...and they had an opportunity to make it enjoyable although it has been done before with Fame. There was one bright spot in the casting...Johnny Lewis who plays a nerdy innovative percussionist. His character was enjoyable to watch and hindsight 2020 I wish the movie had starred him and taken it from his perspective.I thought the hubris Duff showed in one interview I heard about was tragic she was quoted as saying that it was a challenge for her to sing badly in parts of the movie to show her character's growth as a singer...ha!!! My my my aren't we full of ourselves!!!".

I thought Terri's relationship with her brother was very moving  and the scene where she first saw his DVD that was sent to the school was very well done  I could almost feel her grief. The teachers were well done. Thanks to everyone who made this film. I will be purchasing the DVD. Remember that Hilary is 16 years old when this was filmed  I look forward to the next decade as Hilary finishes her teens and goes into her 20's. My only complaint about Hilary  lose the fake hair  just let yours grow  it looks better.".

Hilary plays Terri Fletcher and yes it does sound like the desperate housewife. Well Terri has a great talent and she HAS to get a summer music school. But her mean father won't let her BUT THEN luckily for Terri her brother dies so in a kind of well u can now but not really way she gets to go to the summer school but don't tell dad. Its the usual story its really hard to manage here blah blah but it all works out in the end.AAH this isn't really a film. It's just a nice story to watch for a while but i promise you will think it was a waste of your life for the seemingly endless number of minutes it takes up. I suggest you go out and watch Mean Girls instead its really much better. However having said all that if you love the Duff then this a film for you. For the entire film she dances crys and smiles furiously. She acts her little socks off in the hope of winning a Teen Choice Award.".

When she sneaks out to go to the music school she has the best time. Sometimes she's having a hard time dealing with a personal problem but with the help of a very cute boy Oliver James she's trying to handle it.The story makes you laugh by these who aren't even the main characters. The relationship between Kiwi and Sloane is just adorable to watch. For the musicians who read this the music teachers in the movie give you great advice thats what they did to me.It's just a great movie to watch it will make you laugh but sometimes you also have to take the tears away.".

	onyx:emotionText "This movie is definitely great it has a lot subjects in it like sad happy angry love..The story is about a girl Hilary Duff who desperately wants to go to a music program but who isn't allowed by her dad. When she sneaks out to go to the music school she has the best time. Sometimes she's having a hard time dealing with a personal problem but with the help of a very cute boy Oliver James she's trying to handle it.The story makes you laugh by these who aren't even the main characters. The relationship between Kiwi and Sloane is just adorable to watch. For the musicians who read this the music teachers in the movie give you great advice thats what they did to me.It's just a great movie to watch it will make you laugh but sometimes you also have to take the tears away.";

	schema:reviewBody "I would like to preface this statement by saying that I have never really been a Hilary Duff fan and so I entered this movie with a clear bias against it. However even if I was viewing cold I still would have hated the movie. Let's start with the acting. Very boringstandard across the board with no knockout exceptions. Basically it was mediocre. While the leads weren't fantastic neither was anyone else. The only exception I could possibly grant would be for the emo goth piano playing chick. The script was stunted and awkward at best. Entirely predictable and feel good artsy. My personal favorite scene was HilaryBritish punk boy on the roof where she initially denies him a kiss then a few minutes and a compliment later she puts out. Also Corbett at one point says Artists feel things differently then other people. Come on. If that's not pretentious I don't know what is. I would also like to comment on the lack of talent. Supposedly Duff was accepted to the most prestigious music school in the US. Why then was everyone's talents only slightly above average? The big choir project was the Hallelujah chorus which I sang in high school. I'm not saying that the kids were bad I'm just saying they certainly weren't the epitome of talent for their age group. I would also like to question the movie's moral intent. Duff is theoretically a good little Christian girl but she engages in a number of immoral activities i.e. lying to her father covering up underage drinking etc. Even though both were for a good cause I then would examine a script that would glorify such behavior. Even if her father was unable to give up his own emotional baggage for the sake of his daughter does that really constitute and justify such extreme behavior? And really why is her mother enabling her husband's weaknesses? Marital problems are best worked out when the children aren't used as pawns. As for the drinking Hilary not only hides British punk boy on the roof but then stays with him all night. Alone. On the roof. After he kissed the other girl. What does that teach girls? I'm not a prude by any means but this was advertised as a movie I would want to take my little 7 year old sister to.In the future I would only watch this movie drunk. Bad choice bad acting bad script bad movie. Cheap laughs for cinematic disaster.".

Hillary's voice is fine for pop music but if she was trying to pull off being an academically serious music student she failed. I do not wish to sound pretentious but when singing an Eighteenth Century Italian Aria one must at the very least use proper Italian. No pop fan likes to hear an opera singer singing pop. Well no one who properly understands classical music wants to her a pop singer with bad diction spread vowels no breath support bad posture neck tension and a locked jaw take her chest voice up higher than it's naturally supposed to go. Also it was very clear that her voice had been edited and enhanced. The significant number of missing overtones make it clear that she should not be singing standard classical repertoire. Some pop singers would do well with classical repertoire because they have strong technique. Hillary Duff is not one of them. I have no problem with the premise of the movie and I think her acting is terrific but if they wanted Hillary to be portrayed as doing well at a prestigious music program then they should not have chosen Caro Mio Ben or the Hallelujah Chorus as music to have her sing.".

Any movie that promotes Hilary Duff as an amazing singer can't take itself too seriously.The start was sad. I must admit I cried. But as soon as someone told her 'she was the best singer in the world' things started getting funny.First of all if you like those teenage romantic comedies this one has nothing. It was the most contrived and chemistryless relationship I have ever seen in a movie. Why do film makers think that they put two attractive people in the same school  wow voila without even talking to each other they are madly in love. I partially think it's because anytime I've seen Hilary Duff in a movie she just doesn't really seem to have chemistry with any of her love interests.Second of all be prepared to be amused at the singing with numerous cringes when Hilary Duff goes solo. In my opinion she cannot sing well by herself. She needs electronic equipment auto tuners etc to make her sound presentable. But once you try and forget the fact that people actually buy her albums you can just enjoy her performances as an actor trying to sing! Apart from that it was an entertaining movie. If you don't like these type of movies though don't go. And watch out for the dad! Man that guy can act. He must have had 3 different expressions for the whole film mad 90 of the time happy 2 suspicious 8. I especially like the toothpick in his mouth when he's talking. It really adds to his monotone voice!".

	schema:reviewBody "spoilersThose familiar with the Korean romance that is getting more and more global attention may or may not agree with what I say about Marriage Is A Crazy Thing. On the surface Marriage seems to be very different from other movies in this genre where a kiss would often seem too explicit an expression of love. Underneath the somewhat shocking explicit sex scenes for a Korean movie Marriage is however another Korean romance with the characteristic qualities. I'm not going to repeat the examples I listed in my comments on Lover's Concerto 2002 another Korean romance.The plot of Marriage remotely resembles that of Same Time Next Year 1978 which in turn was adapted from a Neil Simon play I believe. The resemblance however is only superficial.In Marriage they meet at a blind date at the introduction of a mutual friend. He is however not a callow youth nor she a blushing maiden. The first date winds up in a hotel room as they jump into bed the instant they close the door.As the story unfolds we see more of the personalities behind the two pleasant looking faces. He is a happygolucky flirty parttime professor financially insecure and still living with his parents. Fascinatingly all at once both coy and coquettish she has a mind of her own seeking romance but not forgetting financial security. While he shuns any relationship that threatens to become a permanent commitment she ponders over pursuing such a relationship with him which will likely lead to a life of insufficiency if not outright poverty.We see there relationship evolve along a mildly rocky path until she marries a medical doctor for obvious reasons. Taking a slight turn their relationship continues as they jointly rent an apartment and share whatever time she can snatch from her conventional life. This becomes somewhat reminiscent of Oskar Werner's  Interlude 1968 but with his and her role reversed. We see how they gradually come to a realisation that while they have all this time tried to play cool they care for each other more than they are ready to admit. It is interesting to observe that by the end of the movie she has not changed much knowing what she wants knowing what she can handle as she had been right from the beginning. He on the other hand has lost much of the carefree selfassurance worn down by increasing consciousness of his own financial inadequacy. For people who have enjoyed the Korean romance genre Marriage is an interesting variation that brings something new but at the same time staying within the familiar grounds. Certainly recommended.".

And so it appears to be a sort of tragedy and I read it as such. The photography is modern clean and with a few touches of flourish in an otherwise classical style. The acting is believable and the story is interesting but not quite engrossing. There are also a few lovemaking scenes with explicit dialog and a very mildly kinky twist.I think I was most impressed with how neat the entire package is from a well drafted story to developed characters all the visual and audio elements well put together and a rather interesting message that I feel is subtle enough that not everyone might get it. As such I have to say that this was surprisingly enjoyable to watch and left me with a few things to think about as well as I reach the upper years of my 20s getting ready to step into the 30s that the principles live in.

	schema:reviewBody "Marriage Is A Crazy Thing is a film that talks about how love conquers all in the most unusual situations. Society in Korea deems that marriage must be complete before age 30. Marry a man and make love with another! Joonyoung gets a blind date for being the best man at a friend's wedding. He's a charming and smart college lecturer who believes in free sex. Yonhee is a daring and sexy lighting designer. Through a long relay of superficial questions they get drunk. They figured it'd be cheaper to get a motel room than to get a cab.They go all the way. They both expected different things from each other. Yonhee wanted to marry a welltodo doctor and keep Joonyoung on the side for sex. Will she be successful? The movie is about two people that met on a blind date that never want to admit that each has already fallen in love with each other after spending a onenight stand. Or in other words it is about two people who don't want to take their relationship to the next level after being engaged in a fling. I think that a better title for this film is Love Is A Crazy Thing. The acting was great. Kam WuSungwho plays an English professor shows that he does not need to overact to sympathize with his character. While Eum JungHwathe adulteress never disappoints as well. The film started slow but the two lead characters were able make it interesting. This film is another reason why Koreans will always be considered as one of the most creative when it comes to world cinema.Highly recommended and it deserves an excellent rating for me.".

	schema:headline " A worthy new version of Jane Eyre with marvelous visuals and excellent performances";
	schema:reviewBody "Charlotte Bront's Jane Eyre has been my favorite book since I was 11 years old. The tale of a feisty orphangirlturnedgoverness who finds true love in a spooky mansion and ultimately redeems a tormented hero has made it to the top of every Best Love Stories list since it was first published in 1847 and with good reason. It's the perfect Gothic novel melding mystery horror and the classic medieval castle setting with heartstopping romance. There have been at least 18 film versions of Jane Eyre and 9 madefortelevision movies27 in all! I have seen most of them some multiple timesboth out of my deep love for the tale and as part of the research for my novel The Secret Diaries of Charlotte Bront the true story of Charlotte's remarkable life her inspiration behind Jane Eyre and her turbulent reallife romance.Every screen version of JANE EYRE has its merits. I especially loved Timothy Dalton's portrayal of Mr. Rochester in the 1983 miniseries and the 2006 Masterpiece Theatre miniseries starring Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens. I was very curious to see how the new JANE EYRE adaptation from Focus Films would measure up. I am happy to report that the film which I saw last night at an advance screening is very good indeed with marvelous visuals terrific performances and enough unique elements to make it a worthy new addition.The most notable distinction that sets this film apart from the rest is its structure. Rather than telling the tale in a linear fashion it begins at a crisis moment later in the story and tells the majority of the tale in flashbackwhich works wonderfully well enabling screenwriter Moira Buffini to effectively compress a long novel into a twohour time span.The movie opens as Jane is fleeing Thornfield after having discovered Mr. Rochester's dark and heartbreaking secret. We fear for her as she becomes lost on the stormy moor. The mystery continues as St. John Rivers wellplayed by a sympathetic yet appropriately stern Jamie Bell and his sisters take her in. As Jane ruminates about the past events that led to her escape we are treated to the story in flashback.The casting of Mia Wasikowska as Jane Eyre also sets this production apart since she is closer in age than most actresses who've played the role to the character in the novel who was about 18 years old in the Thornfield section. Although I wish Mia's Jane was a bit more swoony over Mr. Rochester earlier on yes she is supposed to be stoic but I missed that phase where we get to see her blossom as she falls in love with him and then is utterly crushed when she believes him to be in love with Miss Ingram Mia truly inhabits the role beautifully portraying Jane's sense of selfrespect integrity and restraint as well as her passion and vulnerability.Michael Fassbender embodies Mr. Rochester with the ideal blend of charisma and sinister brooding while at the same time allowing glimpses of his underlying desperation and the wounded depths of his soul. Sally Hawkins as Mrs. Reed effectively portrays the icy ogre who menaces the young Jane a spirited and appealing Amelia Clarkson. And Judi Dench as always gives a superb performance as housekeeper Mrs. Fairfax.The film's locations do justice to the novel's often gloomy atmospheric tone. Director Cary Fukunaga makes excellent use of Haddon Hall in Derbyshire one of the oldest houses in England as Thornfield Hall emphasizing its dark Gothic masculine feel. The exterior locationsgardens cliffs craggy rocks stone walls and seemingly endless fieldsmake an arresting dramatic backdrop for the story. You truly feel as though you are in the middle of nowhere.My only minor gripes are that when Mr. Rochester's secret is revealed it feels a little too prettified and the ending was too abrupt for me. But that aside the filmmakers have done a masterful job translating the novel to the screen. I highly recommend it! Syrie James".

	schema:headline " A worthy adaptation... but left me wanting more";
	schema:reviewBody "The oftfilmed Charlotte Bront's Gothic novel has been adapted into TV and film more than two dozen times. Here's a summary of what works and what doesn't in this 2011 versionTHE GOOD  Cary Fukunaga's direction. He preferred natural light for much of the film forgoing camera lighting and instead opted for candles which created the proper dark moody and gloomy atmosphere that matches Rochester's temperament perfectly. He used some handheld camera work to great effect but not too much so that it became distracting. Thornfield Hall Rochester's expansive mansion looked like something Count Dracula could comfortably settle in. It practically becomes its own character here and adds the necessary spookiness we come to expect from this Gothic tale. Judi Dench as Mrs. Fairfax  When does Dame Judi ever disappoint? Apparently never. Even in small roles the scenes she's in are one of the best ones in the movie. There was an important scene involving Jane and Rochester where Mrs. Fairfax didn't utter a single word but she made quite an impact just with her expression. Mia Wasikowska as Jane. A lot of the issues I have with literary adaptation is that the supposedly plain heroine usually ends up being played actresses who are too glamorous for the role. Fortunately in this one Wasikowska was believable as a plain young girl though she obviously is a pretty girl. At 18 she's also the perfect age for the role. If I were to nitpick though she's not exactly 'little' as she's described in the novel as Rochester doesn't quite tower over her. In any case I thought she did a wonderful job carrying the film. She captures the essence of the strongwilled character who holds her own against her much older subject of her affection and one who despite 'not being wellacquainted with men' doesn't seem intimidated by them. Michael Fassbender as Rochester. In many ways we evaluate a Jane Eyre adaptation by its Rochester and as long as we use that 'calculation' I think he measures up quite well. He has a strong screen presence and is the kind of actor who's usually the best thing even in a soso film and he makes the most of what's given to him. Even with the relatively short screen time which is less than what I had hoped he's able to make us care for Rochester. THE NOTSOGOOD  This cliffnotes version feels way too fast. With a complex story like this no doubt it'd be a challenge for any filmmaker no matter how talented to pare it down into a twohour movie. So it's inevitable that this film just moves along too quick for me. Of course that is not Fukunaga's fault and he really made the best of it but still this version just leaves me wanting more. I guess this is perhaps a more 'accessible' version for the crowd that otherwise would not watch JE. But to me the story is compelling enough that an extra halfhour would only enhance the viewing experience and allow enough time for the characters to develop an authentic connection. Dialog omission. This is perhaps a result of being 'spoiled' by the comprehensive 1983 version which at 5.5 hours is perhaps the longest screen adaptation. Of course it's impossible to include every single dialog from the book but I was hoping at least some of the important ones are kept. The famous quotes such as I am no bird and no net ensnares me Do as I do trust in God and yourself Reader I married him are not spoken in this adaptation. I also find some of the delivery lacks bite y'know that certain oomph that an actor does to bring those timeless words to life. Jamie Bell seems miscast. Now keep in mind I really like Jamie as an actor and have said so many times on my blog httptinyurl.commozzs5 However I don't feel he's right for the role of St. John Rivers. Firstly when you've already got someone as striking as Fassbender as Rochester I'd think the casting agent would have to find someone much fairer than he. No offense to Jamie but that's not the case here and he certainly doesn't fit the book description of 'tall fair with blue eyes and with a Grecian profile.' Now physical appearance aside he also lack the solemn and pious sensibility of a Christian missionary. Unconventional storyline  Moira Buffini's script tells the story in flashback mode instead of following the novel's linear storyline. The movie starts off right as Jane is leaving Thornfield which is right smack dab where the main crisis of the story begins. Now I can understand that it's done to make it less tedious yet it gets confusing at times to figure out which part happens in the past or present. I think for someone not familiar with the book the shuffled time line might be a bit tough to follow.IN CONCLUSION despite leaving the theater wanting more I do think this is a worthy adaptation. The production quality is top notch with gorgeous cinematography affecting light work and music that serve the story well. There is even one scene of Jane and Rochester that Fukunaga took liberty with that's quite tantalizing. It caught me off guard but I must say that scene left me breathless and is an effective way to convey how much Jane longed for her true love.But in the end even though I adore Fassbender he still hasn't replaced Timothy Dalton as my favorite Rochester. Sure the production quality of this one is superior but what makes a Jane Eyre story so fascinating and memorable are the heartwrenching connection between the two main protagonists and the dialog spoken between them so in that regard the 1983 version is still the one to beat.".

	schema:headline " Wonderful new Jane Eyre";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw a sneak preview of Jane Eyre last night at AFISilver in Silver Spring MD. This is a beautifully filmed engrossing and haunting version of the classic Charlotte Bronte novel Jane Eyre. This film is worth seeing and it will leave you thinking about it long after you have left the theater. It captures that otherworldly and isolated environment that Jane inhabits in her lonely life. After you witness the unloved childhood and brutal boarding school you can understand how Jane can not only adapt to her isolated employment but revel in a world where the absence of abuse is a relief. One thing that struck me was the way the actress portraying Jane Eyre Mia Wasikowska inhabited Jane's being. The quiet stillness the dignity the steely nerves under the mask of composure. I have been trying to recall another actress who portrayed the physicality of a woman a governess in that time period so perfectly. She wasn't a modern actress in a corset she moved like a young woman who is used to the corset and layers of cloth and the expectations on a young woman in Victorian England. I also particularly enjoyed the portrayal of a vibrant intelligent woman who knows she is caged by the norms of her society and her position in it. Miss Wasikowska did a wonderful portrayal of Jane giving her great depth while still letting the emotions flit across her usually stoic face. I also liked Mrs Reed  she is a wholly human villain petty cruel insecure and resentful. You can see her in Miss Ingram a petty woman who could turn hateful. The young Jane is a stand out performance all spit and fury you realize that Jane's survival is due to her courage. That the intensity of the child is coiled inside the adult Jane. The cinematography is beautiful the sets and costumes look accurate the screenplay handled well and the directing outstanding. I also appreciate that no character was over done. This film will age well where some other versions can make you cringe now. This film is going to make me pick up the novel and read it again after a very long time. Not a bad recommendation for a movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "As an avid fan of the novel I was very excited to see this preview and I have waited anxiously for the film. I finally saw it today at the threatre and it was wonderful! Excellent. This is the best film version of Jane Eyre yet and I've seen most of them. This is handsdown the best CASTING for Jane Eyre yet. I have never seen a more perfect Jane Eyre Edward Rochester or Mrs. Fairfax. Period. Jane brought tears to my eyes so many many times in this film. She was simply perfect. Small softspoken young composed graceful dignified and lovely in her uniquely plain way. And Edward Rochester? Wow what a ruggedly handsome man! He was certainly not prettyboy handsome but rugged masculine with sharp features a deep voice and a sometimes abrupt and harsh manner. He was exactly as described in Jane Eyre! BRAVO to you both Michael Fassbender and Mia Wasikowska!In my opinion Fassbender and Wasikowska have finally given us perfect embodiments of all we adored in them.... Jane Eyre and Edward Rochestertwo of the most beloved fictional characters of all time. Brilliant performances really. I am truly delighted.The sets costumes lighting art mood cinematography and score were all excellent. I hope the Academy Award is awake and paying attention!Loving the novel as I do I found a few flaws I must mention I didn't think Blanche was nearly pretty enough Bertha was not frightening enough Rochester's kindnesses to Jane were not displayed here an audience member might wonder why she loved him as she did St. John Rivers was a much harsher character here not gentle and lovable as he was in the book and lastly the film was less than two hours long and therefore too much was left out of the story. I fervently wish it could have been 20 or 30 minutes longer. Another 20 or 30 minutes might have helped the audience understand even better Jane's desolate past her fierce love for Rochester and her bright future.That may sound like a lot of criticism but you must consider what a masterpiece the novel Jane Eyre is. The novel is often considered ahead of its time due to its masterful portrayal of the development of a thinking and passionate young woman who is individualistic desiring for a full life while also highly moral.Overall I highly recommend the film. It was artfully told. I cried I gasped I laughed I flinched and I cried some more. I know I'll enjoy watching it again and again.THANK YOU to the actors director and everyone involved in bringing this film to its fruition. Hopefully it will prompt new generations of fans to read the novel and fall in love with Jane Eyre as so many of us have since it was published in 1847.This film is beautiful romantic frightening sometimes funny and ultimately very moving. See it on the big screen at the theatre. I think you'll love it!".

The novel is often considered ahead of its time due to its masterful portrayal of the development of a thinking and passionate young woman who is individualistic desiring for a full life while also highly moral.Overall I highly recommend the film. It was artfully told. I cried I gasped I laughed I flinched and I cried some more. I know I'll enjoy watching it again and again.THANK YOU to the actors director and everyone involved in bringing this film to its fruition. Hopefully it will prompt new generations of fans to read the novel and fall in love with Jane Eyre as so many of us have since it was published in 1847.This film is beautiful romantic frightening sometimes funny and ultimately very moving. See it on the big screen at the theatre. I think you'll love it!";

The movie is beautifully filmed and conveys the moodiness and foreboding associated with the story. The acting is great by all members of the cast. This movie tells a story and tells it well. It provides a glimpse of nineteenth century English society and how people looked and acted at that time. Yet the movie is more than a period piece its themes are timeless. At no time does the story drag. Jane Eyre is heroic. She is the epitome of human goodness not the kind that's candycoated but the kind that is genuine. She transcends a harsh childhood to become a source of great strength for everyone around her. Unlike most Hollywood movies today Jane Eyre is storydriven and the story is strong. This movie is well worth watching and the title character is a role model for adolescents or young adults of all ages to emulate.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm very surprised to read the glowing reviews this version of Jane Eyre is receiving. Like other reviewers Jane Eyre is my absolute favorite book and so I've seen every TVmovie version of it starting with the Orson Welles version. I will agree that the scenery was gorgeous but other than that I was pretty disappointed. There's no way to condense this fantastic story into a twohour movie and do it justice there's just too much detail and when left out it makes for a choppy retelling. While watching it at first I kept filling in all the parts that were left out. Then I'd try to watch it as someone who had never read the book but that left me too confused because of the speed at which the story was told and the flashback retelling of the story.Also this version has Jane becoming an heiress but what about the fact that St. John and his sisters truly are Jane's relatives??? Her generosity to them wasn't just a nice gesture for taking her in when she showed up at their door.The ending completely irritated me. Jane and Rochester's reunion at the end was a second love story and it received all of 12 minutes before cutting off.I also agree with other reviewers who didn't seefeel any passion between this Jane and Rochester. While I did like their looks for the parts their scenes together felt like they were reciting lines not falling in love with each other. And I didn't see any of the passion in Michael Fassbender that you could see with Timothy Dalton or Toby Stephens. If anything he made me think that Daniel DayLewis would make for an excellent Rochester by bringing more depth to the character.All in all I would recommend people to use their money to rent the Timothy Dalton or Toby Stephens version of this story vs. using it to attend this version.".

That certainly begs the question of why anyone from writer Moira Buffini to director Cary Fukunaga to Dame Judi Dench would feel inspired to recreate this comingofage story about love and accepting its blemishes.Fukunaga's Sin Nombre take doesn't exactly provide an amazing revelation or epiphanic justification for bringing Jane Eyre back to life but it does prove that no classic can be so overdone that it becomes untouchable even the most tried and dated of love stories can find new life. Fukanaga has given Jane Eyre a photorealistic makeover devoid of frills and fiercely au naturel but no less gripping than the story's livelier retellings.Fictional period dramas often feel overtly pristine and glazed over to the point of fairytale but in watching this film you get the sense that this is quite possibly how the story would have looked and felt if it had been true. All the way down to accents this rendition has clearly labored over historical authenticity and it shows in the finished product.Mia Wasikowska The Kids Are All Right continues to choose spoton independent films despite leading the billiondollar Alice in Wonderland of 2010 and it continues to pay off. She's clearly adept at embodying literary characters or at least at recreating them within herself rather than worrying about trying to become the way the majority perceives them. Her modest looks suit Jane perfectly and she can play both the fragile girl who has been so often wronged by those who were supposed to care for her and the somewhat selfassured young woman who so plainly understands right from wrong.Buffini Tamara Drewe tells Jane Eyre in an unnarrated flashback. The film opens with Jane dashing away from the spectre of the Thornfield estate and stumbling through the beautifully captured but cold and desolate English countryside in a state of total anguish. She arrives at the Rivers' place where they enquire as to her identity. As the voice of Mr. Rochester Michael Fassbender beckons her she cannot block out the memories of her journey. The film then catches up to that point in real time and continues on to the end.Other than a terrific performance from Amelia Clarkson as young Jane the early chapters involving Lowood School seem to be of less significance in this version other than the very clear point to establish Mr. Brocklehurst as an insensitive headmaster and clearly spell out Jane's early traumas that have affected her perspective. The love story between Jane and Mr. Rochester and the way it affects Jane takes supreme precedence in this film and with a two hour run time rightfully so. Nevertheless the short beginnings prevent the film from showing the whole scope of Jane's troubled life.Fassbender and Wasikowska work terrifically and manage to communicate the class and age discrepancy that made Jane Eyre a juicy read back in the 19th Century. Fassbender does seem to let Rochester's guard down quicker than expected but I enjoyed his choice to be less standoffish and more brooding he determines his secret to be more a responsibility of an unfortunate nature than a loathsome burden. His love for Jane then feels more sincere.An actress as magnetizing as Judi Dench choosing to play the caretaker Mrs. Fairfax sums up the humble attitude of this Jane Eyre. She uses her gravitas to the effect of being the film's lone comic relief and complements the scenes rather than stealing them from Wasikowska who is 55 years her junior.The film itself aims for subtlety and chooses not to amp up the shock value of the story's most pivotal scenes. There's some manufactured suspense but it's mostly natural. It ends up being the most commendable aspect of Fukunaga's vision but maybe the most hampering as well. He creates exceptional tone and mood with the help of his wonderful cast and this seizes our interest but his Jane never takes a chance with any emotional punches. A superbly crafted film just not a resonant one.Steven C".

	schema:headline " JE aficionados keep your expectations low and you won't be disappointed";
	schema:reviewBody "A lover of Charlotte Bronte's novel I did not care for this movie version of Jane Eyre. Perhaps for someone who has never read the book the movie works but I thought the screenplay was seriously lacking and strangely slow paced given how much of the story was left out. For my money Moira Buffini who wrote the screenplay just didn't seem able to properly portray the development of JaneRochester's relationship especially given the 2hour time constraint. In fact I was left wondering whether Buffini had thoroughly read or attempted to understand the novel or if she just based her hitormiss screenplay on some Cliff Notes version. I think it's safe to assume that some of the blame also lies with Cary Fukunaga's direction of his actors. For all I know maybe the resulting movie was largely his own vision of Jane Eyre the Movie rather than Buffini's. Central to the story is the evolving relationship between Jane and Edward Rochester. However in this version the viewer is expected to get that Jane and Edward are falling for each other based on a few spotty scenes or bits of dialog with much of the book's context missing. I found myself having to mentally fill in way too many blanks. I think that an extra 20 minutes would have been perfect to flesh out the JaneRochester dialog and to allow for the addition of a scene or two where we could see why these two people become attracted to each other. For example how about a 1to2minute montage of scenes of Rochester waxing eloquent about his exotic travels and the interesting people he's met with Jane listening raptly? The ending needed to be expanded an extra 5 or so minutes as well. That's one of the most delicious parts of the story and I didn't care to see it all sewn up in 60 seconds. Michael Fassbinder was a pleasant surprise. He might be a little better looking than Rochester ought to be but I could see early on that he had the chops to pull off what could have been the best Rochester yet well in a betterwritten film. I liked that he seemed willing to show us the really notsolikable side of Rochester and those mercurial moods we see in the book. Mia Wasikowska's abilities I'm not too sure about although I did think she had an acceptably young and plain look about her unlike Ruth Wilson whose unJanianlike looks ruined the 2006 version for me. I thought that Mia largely failed to convey with her unchanging serious expression all the turmoil that Jane is experiencing inwardly as her relationship with Rochester develops. Since we don't have benefit of a narrator in the movie as we do in the book we rely on the actor to tell or show us what's going on inside. I don't think Mia did an effective job of this. I found the main characters' chemistry spotty at best. I'm blaming most of this on the screenplay as well. And here's why During the postwedding scenewhere Rochester pleads his case both actors demonstrated that they could have chemistry together nice chemistryand could convey all the passion I had been expecting but not seeing elsewhere in the movie. But this chemistry only appeared for me when the dialog and the scene were fleshed out enough to clearly show the actors the way as in the abovementioned instance. I felt like Mia particularly did not connect with the character of Jane without benefit of sufficient dialog context and direction. Again I felt that the screenplay and maybe direction simply let the actors down more often than not they simply did not have enough to hang their hats on so to speak. The one thing this version of JE really did have going for it IMO was the wonderful cinematography costumes and sets.".

Perhaps for someone who has never read the book the movie works but I thought the screenplay was seriously lacking and strangely slow paced given how much of the story was left out. For my money Moira Buffini who wrote the screenplay just didn't seem able to properly portray the development of JaneRochester's relationship especially given the 2hour time constraint. In fact I was left wondering whether Buffini had thoroughly read or attempted to understand the novel or if she just based her hitormiss screenplay on some Cliff Notes version. I think it's safe to assume that some of the blame also lies with Cary Fukunaga's direction of his actors. For all I know maybe the resulting movie was largely his own vision of Jane Eyre the Movie rather than Buffini's. Central to the story is the evolving relationship between Jane and Edward Rochester. However in this version the viewer is expected to get that Jane and Edward are falling for each other based on a few spotty scenes or bits of dialog with much of the book's context missing. I found myself having to mentally fill in way too many blanks. I think that an extra 20 minutes would have been perfect to flesh out the JaneRochester dialog and to allow for the addition of a scene or two where we could see why these two people become attracted to each other. For example how about a 1to2minute montage of scenes of Rochester waxing eloquent about his exotic travels and the interesting people he's met with Jane listening raptly? The ending needed to be expanded an extra 5 or so minutes as well. That's one of the most delicious parts of the story and I didn't care to see it all sewn up in 60 seconds. Michael Fassbinder was a pleasant surprise. He might be a little better looking than Rochester ought to be but I could see early on that he had the chops to pull off what could have been the best Rochester yet well in a betterwritten film. I liked that he seemed willing to show us the really notsolikable side of Rochester and those mercurial moods we see in the book. Mia Wasikowska's abilities I'm not too sure about although I did think she had an acceptably young and plain look about her unlike Ruth Wilson whose unJanianlike looks ruined the 2006 version for me. I thought that Mia largely failed to convey with her unchanging serious expression all the turmoil that Jane is experiencing inwardly as her relationship with Rochester develops. Since we don't have benefit of a narrator in the movie as we do in the book we rely on the actor to tell or show us what's going on inside. I don't think Mia did an effective job of this. I found the main characters' chemistry spotty at best. I'm blaming most of this on the screenplay as well. And here's why During the postwedding scenewhere Rochester pleads his case both actors demonstrated that they could have chemistry together nice chemistryand could convey all the passion I had been expecting but not seeing elsewhere in the movie. But this chemistry only appeared for me when the dialog and the scene were fleshed out enough to clearly show the actors the way as in the abovementioned instance. I felt like Mia particularly did not connect with the character of Jane without benefit of sufficient dialog context and direction. Again I felt that the screenplay and maybe direction simply let the actors down more often than not they simply did not have enough to hang their hats on so to speak. The one thing this version of JE really did have going for it IMO was the wonderful cinematography costumes and sets.";

I must say that this newest version is the least faithful to original from all many scenes and key dialogs changed adjusted or cut of and with very poor acting performances. Jane Eyre story originally full of passion and controversial emotions rich dialogs with much depth was in this version unfortunately reduced and lessened so much that it lost its fire and point. If I hadn't seen and read this story before I would have considered it quite weak and empty embarrassing pseudoromantic story without real motion. But Jane Eyre is the exact opposite of this  sadly not in this version. I had an impression that both Jane and Rochester had only 1 at most 2 kinds of facial expressions all the time same said and subdepressive. I do not understand what was the director's and actor's intention in this but in my opinion it has missed its goal. The only enchanting thing was the music which I evaluate highly and was very captivating for me as well as nice face of Jane.I would maybe accept hers production somehow but Rochester here disappointed me entirely. To everybody who is interested in real Jane Eyre or is annoyed or unsatisfied from this version I highly recommend Jane Eyre series with Timothy Dalton from 1986 or as well the series from 2006. There I see the fullness of emotions scenes and scenario that I would expect from filming such quality piece as Bronte's Jane Eyre.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cary Fukunaga's 2011 Jane Eyre is a boring dreary monochromatic misconceived botch. Fukunaga doesn't know who Charlotte Bronte is but he sure knows his Igmar Bergman. He takes a wild beloved and accessible book about a vibrantly alive girl and turns it into a pointlessly morose dry and impenetrable film class experiment. One must ask why was this film even made? There are so many adaptations of Jane Eyre out there including a zombie version  made before the current zombie trend. Who felt a pressing need for a sottovoce mudcolored depressive and anemic Jane Eyre without adequate lighting? From the first scenes watching this movie was toothgrinding torture. Fukunaga's decision to make the film without lighting was a mistake. A dull gray palette does not equate great art. If nothing else Jane Eyre is one of the most colorful books ever written there are physical fights screaming mad women burning castles calculating belles tortured and dying orphans the reunion of longlost relatives and long lost lovers psychic communication murder attempts big dogs and fetching French dancing girls. There are profoundly poignant relationships not just between Jane and Rochester but between Jane and Bessie a servant in her aunt's home Jane and Helen Burns a fellow orphan and Jane and her student Adele. You really can't film all that in an unlit duncolored setting with nearcatatonic performances and expect to do it any justice at all. You are just torturing your material for no good reason trying to turn Jane Eyre into something it is not. Also Jane Eyre is a Gothic novel. Gothic tales are supposed to be presented in a manner that is creepy hairraising and overthetop. There are scenes in Jane Eyre that cry out for expressionist lighting and ominous music  like in the 1944 Orson Welles  Joan Fontain version which if nothing else captured Jane's early years as an impoverished orphan and the Gothic atmosphere very well. Jane Eyre the book's eponymous heroine is the reason to read the book. Scenes of the mistreatment of small children by callous exploiters are bearable because righteous and irrepressible Jane is your guide through all the bleakness misery and injustice. Jane Eyre 2011 attaches leeches to this little firebrand and attempts to bleed her dry. In the opening scenes of the book the reader immediately knows that this is one spunky heroine who fist balled and spine stiff in the face of earthly power will take the reader for a bumpy but unforgettable ride. Jane fights back. Jane demands respect. Jane stands up to everyone from a cousin who beats her to a rich aunt who controls her fate to a sadistic manager of an orphanage to her master at her first job. Jane never stops giving lip standing up insisting on the worth of one of the most wretched of the earth.Jane Eyre 2011 opens with Jane sobbing and wandering aimlessly and prostrate on a rock. Why did Cary Fukunaga turn vibrant feisty colorful Jane Eyre into this limp gray pathetic loser? Was the real Jane of the book too much for him? There's one good bit in this botch Michael Fassbender is an excellent Rochester one of the very best. Enjoying his performance got me through this film. Mia Wasikowska could have made for a very good Jane but her performance like the rest of the film is drained of passion. It's as if Fukunaga instructed his performers to play every scene as quickly and flatly as possible Here you are asking her to marry you. Play it as if you are asking her which subway train goes uptown. And remember  you are distracted not really present and in a hurry. There's no feeling in anything here and Jane Eyre is one of the most feeling books ever written. It is a deeply passionate book and this film is as flat as cold as and as dry as the tundra. Tundras have some purpose though and I can see none for this film.".

I really enjoyed the film acting cinematography costumes etc. I loved Mia and Michael awesome together good chemistry making an excellent Jane and Rochester. My main criticism would be that there were several key scenes that were omitted primarily between when Rochester and Jane meet and when he proposes which kind of gives short shrift to their relationship. They don't really have time to establish the bond that makes their relationship so powerful so that it comes slightly out of left field when they confess their love to each other. Many other omissions make this feel like the Cliff Notes version and my movie companion was left missing a lot of the magic and nuance because he hasn't read the book and was confused by some of the leaps and bounds the film made.The pivotal scenes that have been cut which are shown in the trailer are vital to the story and I'm left wondering why they were dropped. But then that's a major pet peeve of mine If a scene doesn't make it into the movie don't put it in the trailer! Argh! It always feels like false advertising to me. But anyways back to the positives...The scenes between Jane and Rochester feel pretty electric. Jane is sharp as a whip which is right on target. In my opinion the best thing about this movie is that they FINALLY showed the scene portrayed in Chapter 27 which is my absolute favorite chapter which they never do justice to in the films. They even included the I could bend her with my finger and my thumb line where a desperate Rochester notes that he could physically force Jane to submit to his will but he still wouldn't control what he cherishes most her soul. In the film it felt somewhat natural and organic too which is a hard thing to pull off. Loved it! Also showing Rochester bursting into Jane's room the morning after frantic to discover Jane is gone awesome! It's so much better than Rochester impotently watching Jane walk away which is what some other film versions have done.The ending is romantic but abrupt I like more closure to my happy endings and Jane and Rochester need more happiness after a lifetime of misery.Final critique by switching up the chronology you don't meet Rochester until halfway through the movie and he's sort of the fire of the piece. Without Rochester there's not much story and I think the film would've benefited by introducing him a little earlier.Loved that Rochester puts his pants on AFTER he and Jane put out the fire.

It is the strength of the spirit and passion. Everyone you meet in the book has both of these qualities. They are present through the way characters act and interact the thoughts they think the choices they make the feelings they posses. The story takes place in England at a more traditional time written by one of humanity great authors. For that reason the book has depth that must be captured by a movie to be successful. To people who can not identify with spirit and passion in the book it will seem arid. It is obvious how the director and actors perceived the book if they have read it at all. This movie have squeezed the life out of great literary work creating a shallow spasmodic ghost story locking any kind of depth.".

They are present through the way characters act and interact the thoughts they think the choices they make the feelings they posses. The story takes place in England at a more traditional time written by one of humanity great authors. For that reason the book has depth that must be captured by a movie to be successful. To people who can not identify with spirit and passion in the book it will seem arid. It is obvious how the director and actors perceived the book if they have read it at all. This movie have squeezed the life out of great literary work creating a shallow spasmodic ghost story locking any kind of depth.";

	schema:reviewBody "I have read Jane Eyre many many times and was stunned to see the images from my own mind projected on screen. I've never been to Yorkshire but the director captures the essence of the story as I myself have mentally lived it time and time again. It was unusual to have the narration begin in the middle of the book but it works. The story is told in a masterly fashion without unnecessary emphasis on the Gothic horror aspect so beloved of many filmmakers. Mrs Rochester gets about a minute of screen time because in this version her hidden presence is not the point. This is a film about Jane herself about how she goes from unwanted orphan to governess to freeborn independent human being who learns to make her own way in the world. Having seen several screen adaptations of this novel I can inequivocally say this is in my opinion the best of the lot. No facile emotionalism no cheap effectsjust excellent cinematography. I was struck again and again by the attention to detail that made the film a wellcrafted jewel that will bear watching again and again. There's even a closeup of Jane in her simple grey dress and tucker looking much like the famous Richmond portrait of Charlotte Bronte. The director and scriptwriter have done a sterling job in selecting the truly important plot points events and dialogue from the novel to bring it alive for the viewer. One of the few films that will not disappoint fans of the original book and will make the book attractive for those who haven't read it yet.".

Mia Wasikowska and Michael Fassbender were unremarkable in their chemistry together. It lacked the emotion the masterpiece theater version had with Ruth Wilson as Jane Eyre and Toby Stephens as Mr. Rochester. That was truly a beautiful telling. This movie was a poor shadow of it.Although an adequate representation I felt it was a waste of Judi Dench's considerable talent to simply squander it on Mrs. Fairfax where the writer of the screenplay did nothing to show how versatile this actress is.The ending of the movie lacked any substance and felt cut off with the last line which was saccharine and left no explanation whatsoever as to what happened to these characters. I suppose by then I didn't care since I didn't feel pulled in or emotionally involved in the entirety of the story. I will say that Jamie Bell did a very decent job as Mr. St. John Rivers.My advice to anyone in seeing this movie is to wait to rent it on DVD. It's not worth the 10.00 or more dollars to see it in the theater and if you haven't seen the 2006 Masterpiece Theater version then please take advantage of that film because that was a wonderful version.".

I think it may be one of the most underrated books of all time.Now for the movie.Let's get to the good 1 The casting Michael Fassbender is perhaps the hottest Rochester I could ever imagine. He's got the ugly that the character needs while not bothering to try and hide his good looks. He brings a certain something to the character that wasn't in the books.Mia...whatever her last name was okay. She's young so at least they kept that in the movie. But she's quiet and meek which is what Jane is really like.But there is zero chemistry between them. And what there is is forced.2 The music absolutely wonderful!! 3 The scenery Gorgeous! Just the Thornfield I had imagined in my head come to life.Now for the bad 1 Pacing The movie went by way to fast. It missed the whole buildup and friendship between Jane and Rochester so when it came to for them to declare their love it was a WTF moment.2 Lack of important parts the whole book is focused on Jane's lack of family. Then we find out that the Rivers family is actually her family as well.The movie completely ignored this! And they made John into an admirer of Jane! WTF? Jane's background is barely touched on. Where is her friendship with Helen? And what about Lowood and the Reed girls? 3 Timing Again it was rushed. But the timing of the story is all over the place. I didn't mind that they told it as a backstory but it was kind of distracting.I've seen the deleted scenes and I think that if they were included the story would've flowed smoother and made much more sense. And really was it that hard to include a few extra scenes that are important such as Adele and Rochester's connection? Those scenes would've made the movie maybe 1012 minutes longer which the movie desperately could've used.4 The Ending Um...what? I thought I was watching Jane Eyre and not Pride and Prejudice. There was an epilogue at the end of the book which shows what happened to Rochester and Jane. Instead the writers went for a Jane Austen ala PP sequence that slowly fades out with them.Boring and anti climatic to a very predictable movie based on a very harsh and real love story.How can a true fan of the book say this is great? They leave out just about everything important! ie. Bertha AdeleRochester connection the Reeds the Rivers Lowood Bessie and so much more However if you never read the book then its great. Usually I have no problem separating book from film but this was ridiculous. They filmed most of those parts that I mentioned then deleted them. What a waste.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having read the book many times since a young teenager and having seen many many versions screen and miniseries the 2011 version disappoints. First instead of repeating some scenes filmtime could have been used for really important missed elements plus an extra 15 minutes would have also helped. Mia is truly lovely and one of my favourite young actress today but her portrayal leaned too much to the 1dimensional and stoic. The literary Jane is plain and poor but she is extremely intelligent spiritual and passionately drawn to and unwaveringly in love with Rochester. This film gives too few opportunities for us to see these elements. Most important this movie does no justice to the tormented lost changeable sardonic kind passionate gentlemanboynobleman that is Rochester. Bronte is clear fate knocked him about. She spends pages and pages using literary devices metaphors  dialogue to show the reader that Rochester was actually born to be the happier kinder 2nd brother with talent and charm raised with obligation to please his father  older brother. What fate thrust upon him caused his pain roaming  moodiness but it did not change his inherent nature kindness charm dutifulness. It cost him 15 years of his youth but he's really still that dutiful good young man forced to also be a maturing nobleman. Bronte created a Rochester  Jane that the reader wanted to draw out. The sensuality between them  their passion for life  each other constantly brimming at the surface but held in check with pain  strict respect for convention. The book is clear that Jane herself was tormented  tempted before leaving Thornfield to break convention her sexual passion  love for Rochester so overwhelming. Likewise the book is also clear on Rochester's respect for strictness convention responsibility  duty.Its true a reader or viewer can worry in any version of the epic story that Rochester may be sexually harassing Jane in her employment. But in fact Bronte makes it clear that both were tempted to break convention that the love was mutual deep  true. Though Jane is young she is not woman who needs  wants flattery. She has found a man who loves her mind  soul. And Rochester after roaming the world for a decade finally finds the woman meant for him. She the one he yearns for intellectually sexually passionately and yet does not have to flatter her.In Bronte and so many film versions it is true that some of what Rochester does is reckless in trying to draw Jane out  keep her near. But we learn  feel enough of his torment  conflict to know that he does not cross the line to sexual harassment. Unfortunately Fassbender's portrayal did. My husband saw it in a couple scenes and eventually could not watch further. At one point Fassbender even runs after Jane across the stone bridge  bounces around her awkwardly. These awkward elements could have been offset with more filmtime on the growing nature of Jane  Rochester's mutual love bond respect  passion. These would have improved this film.Toby Stephens in 2006 was a surprisingly superb Rochester the mature noble boygentleman at once wicked  dutiful yearning passionately for Jane while loving her for her mind  soul. Ruth Wilson was excellent in showing calm intelligence convention  love. And I like the way the 2006 version clearly established her as leader. the ending of that series made it clear that Wilson's Jane finally got absolutely everything she truly deserved. Timothy Dalton's Rochester in 1983 reigns supreme giving everything Stephens gives but with slightly more austerity  sardonit wit. And when he approaches Jane in the garden he sits far away from where she is standing his eyes full  glistening with his own fear torment  trepidation. Respecting her space Dalton' Rochester begins to speak to Jane calmly yearningly  deeply......the effect of his Rochester on hundreds if not thousands of women can't be underestimated.Read the book watch these 2 versions.".

Jane has a harsh childhood in the boarding school where she loses her best friend Helen Burns Freya Parks. After ten years she is hired by Mrs. Fairfax Judi Dench as the governess of Adele Varens who is the protge of the master of Thornfield Edward Rochester and she leaves Lowood.

Mr. Rochester breaks with his fiance Blanche and proposes Jane. However a gloomy secret from Mr. Rochester's past affects their lives and Jane Eyre does not marry her dearly beloved Mr. Rochester.Jane leaves the property and wanders and is saved by the religious St. John Rivers Jamie Bell and his two sisters. St. John Rivers is a man of God and wants to marry Jane Eyre and travel with her to India. But Jane still loves Mr. Rochester and feels only fraternal love for St. John Rivers.Jane Eyre is a visually stunning adaptation of the classic romance of Charlotte Bront with a perfect lead actress in the role of Jane Eyre but missing important parts of the story. The romance takes place in a harsh time of change in England when money and position seemed all that mattered charity was a cold and disagreeable word and religion too often wore a mask of bigotry and cruelty. However this version ignores the period when Jane Eyre stays in the orphanage and the cruelties that she is submitted. This is the fourth version of Jane Eyre that I have watched and the 1943 version by Robert Stevenson is unbeatable with the impressive atmosphere in black and white that fits to the Gothic fiction of the novel. Further the powerful performance of Orson Welles is incomparable in the role of Edward Rochester.. The 1970 version is more faithful to the novel after the unsuccessful marriage of Jane Eyre and Edward Rochester with an adult discussion of the couple and more accurate fate of Jane. The 1996 version by Franco Zeffirelli is the weakest adaptation of the classic romance by Charlotte Bront. My vote is six.Title Brazil Jane Eyre".

	schema:reviewBody "Jane Eyre is a story that is very near and dear to my heart. The first time I ever experienced JE I watched the 2006 Toby Stephens version with my mother when I was around 1213. I was dazzled by that version. The scenery was beautiful it had a kind of spooky feeling the story was intriguing but what got me hooked on Jane Eyre was the relationship between Jane and Edward.In the 2006 version Stephens and Wilson are passionate and they convey so much through their exchange of glances and subtle expressions. The delivery of the lines is fantastic and so much feeling. Wilson does a perfect job of displaying Jane's passionate and romantic nature while also showing her inner strength and clear sightedness. Toby Stephens was an excellent Rochester. You could see how tortured he was and he was amazing at going from charming and pleasant one second to brooding and rude the next.After the 2006 version I read JE and got wrapped up in the book too! After years of loving the book and the 2006 version I decided to expand my horizons and watch other adaptations. I watched the 1983 version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke and I loved that one too. It comes in close second to the 2006 version. Timothy Dalton was excellent and Zelah Clarke was pretty good. In my humble opinion not as good as Ruth Wilson but still. when I watched both the 1983 version and the 2006 I felt I was watching the book come to life before my eyes like I was really seeing Jane and Rochester as they were meant to be seen.With 2011 version I was so let down. A few points of the movie were okay mostly I didn't like it. The scenery was fine. I've read some reviews saying how much they loved the Gothic feeling of the movie but I have to disagree. Visually the film looked Gothic but it didn't have that same creepy FEELING that I got watching 2006. JE is supposed to be sort of Gothic but it's also very colourful and vibrant at points. This film seemed like it was trying too hard to be creepy and haunting and instead ended up feeling very dull. I thought Fassbender's Rochester was interesting. He was good at being brooding and not bad to look at. Many people complain that he was too good looking for Rochester which is true but whenever you get an adaptation of Jane Eyre especially a more modern one it's pretty much a given that Rochester is going to be too handsome. I thought there were some moments where Fassbender did well and I think if he had had a better script his Rochester could've turned out better.Things I felt were wrong...Rushed storyline. The whole plot of the movie felt like a project done by an English student who didn't read the book and just read the cliffnotes. Important scenes were cut and dialog was choppy and I found myself muttering lines that should've been included. AND THE ENDING. It felt like Pride and Prejudice 2005 all over again. The epilogue that's the best part with some of the most emotional scenes!! They completely butchered it trying to go for a dramatic ending that fell flat. They really screwed Jane and Edward's relationship. JE is first and foremost a story about love passion and equality. Wasikowska and Fassbender failed to deliver the passion and emotion that was needed in their characters. I feel this wasn't entirely their fault. The script was lacking and they didn't have much to work with. Also think the director or whoever was telling them how to act in each scene didn't know what they were doing. There were moments during the movie where we saw a little bit of passion. The scene after the wedding where Rochester is pleading with Jane to stay they did alright in that scene. You could see what could've been if the script had been longer and better.I also felt that with the rushed storyline the love between Jane and Rochester didn't seem real. With the proposal scene it felt like the movie was saying Yep! He loves her now. This makes sense! It wasn't authentic. In other versions of JE Rochester is fascinated by Jane. You see them develop friendship and you see them fall in love. SLOWLY. The reason Rochester has the house party with Blanche at Thornfield is to try and make Jane jealous. At this point he is already in love with her and is sure he wants to be with her. He is trying to see if Jane wants him back. The 2011 version feels like by the point Blanche arrives Edward and Jane don't really know each other.They cut out Jane being related to St. John Diana and Mary which was an important part of the story. The whole reason Jane gave them all some inheritance was because she didn't want the money as much she wanted family. And also she felt they were entitled to it as they were related to the uncle as well. THE FORTUNE TELLER SCENE. I was upset about that being cut out.Grace Poole is just completely out of the picture??I was also very mad about the bed fire scene. This is supposed to be a frantic scene. Jane and Rochester were too calm trying to put out the flames. They were just like Oh no a fire. We'd better put that out. Wow.I have more things I didn't enjoy but this is too long. To finish if you want a good quality adaptation of Jane Eyre watch the 1983 version or the 2006 version. I would recommend the 2006 version first because it's my favourite but the 1983 version was great too. Or you could watch them both!".

	onyx:emotionText "Jane Eyre is a story that is very near and dear to my heart. The first time I ever experienced JE I watched the 2006 Toby Stephens version with my mother when I was around 1213. I was dazzled by that version. The scenery was beautiful it had a kind of spooky feeling the story was intriguing but what got me hooked on Jane Eyre was the relationship between Jane and Edward.In the 2006 version Stephens and Wilson are passionate and they convey so much through their exchange of glances and subtle expressions. The delivery of the lines is fantastic and so much feeling. Wilson does a perfect job of displaying Jane's passionate and romantic nature while also showing her inner strength and clear sightedness. Toby Stephens was an excellent Rochester. You could see how tortured he was and he was amazing at going from charming and pleasant one second to brooding and rude the next.After the 2006 version I read JE and got wrapped up in the book too!

	schema:reviewBody "It's the October Holidays now here in Australia which means day time television. Which frankly is trouble  Pretty much anything on day time TV from cooking shows from lame madeforTV movies is pretty woeful. Nothing pains me more than watching day time television on Australian freetoair. But as I have Cable Television you'd be thinking Hey you don't have to deal with crappy shows and movies! Oh yes I do..Someone at Foxtel thought it would be a really funny joke to play 710 Split. I'm surprised they were able to stop laughing for a long enough to even get the movie. But why is this movie such a huge joke? Well let me tell you why! Now whatever you're thinking right now about 710 Split it's worse. This movie is pretty much the bottom of the barrel. Well actually it's worse than what I originally thought. 710 Split doesn't even deserve to be put in the same barrel. If I had to place it somewhere And it's hard decide I tell you it would in the middle of an erupting volcano.710 Spilt. Catchy yes? Well it must be about bowling! Correct! Well kind of. It's actually about a struggling actor. What? Then why is it called '710 Split'?. Aha it's actually about a struggling actor who's trying to make his name by becoming a bowler! Yes you heard right he wants to become a known actor.. by bowling! How did they come up with a plot like this? Of all of the things to make a movie about this is a pretty poor choice. I'm thinking a bunch of producers got drunk one night and stoned one night and picked a script by random and then threw it to the equally drunk and stoned director. But it gets better. It stars Tara Reid  who for the past couple of years has done nothing but appear in a commercial for an Australian telephone company. Great But now here comes the truly horrible part  I have to try and describe why this movie is so bad. Well that's a real big problem because everything is wrong. I don't want to waste your time listing everything there is to do when making a movie so I'll try and tell you some of the worst things yes some of the worse things! Which actually is like trying to find a needle in a hay stack.If I had to attack one element off the top of my head I would have to say the set design. In this movie the main character goes around to several different bowling tournaments around the country. Simple right? Just get a couple of different bowling alleys clear them up and put some banners around right? WRONG! Instead someone arranged to go film at one of their mates' office block clear out all the cubicals grab some chairs slap in a double lane bowling alley and hang some sheets around to make it appear like a room. Well apart from you can see the pins holding up the sheets and you can see the gaps in the tops of the sheets. Now this is bad enough but to make it worse they use the same location over and over for almost all the tournaments! Yeah you are reading this correctly. They just changed the banners.Now it's one thing to have bad sets but to make it worse the acting is horribly lame and completely unfunny or convincing there's some serious scripting problems It's like no one ever read or edited it the directing is dull there's product placements for Beer Nuts and Guinness beer Which I will point out was put in a fridge at one stage  It's meant to be served at room temperature the cinematography is bad the film looks like someone nicked some film from a porno set the music sounds like it was nicked while they were there and the wardrobe is disgusting. There's more.. but I'm becoming bored.This would all be forgivable if the film had some charm but there is none. It feels like there was no passion involved in making this film. On no level does this film ever appeal in fact if this film had been made 60 or so years earlier I bet it would have been used by the SS to torture war prisoners. Given the choice I'd rather be stabbed and left to bleed to death.Oh and I just want to say I only saw about half an hour of it. Which was about half an hour too much.".

This is not the worst movie I have ever seen and I did manage to watch all of it but the acting direction sets script etc. were pretty bad. I did not laugh once. In the first part of the film they portray the two leading males as a pair of fun loving guys trying to get a break as actors but stuck delivering pizzas. I gather that this opening bit was to get us the viewers to identify with the characters as well as create a good board for the plot to spring from. But the scene where the two guys spit out the pizza they'd been chewing on and reform it back into a pizza to be delivered created a very different impression to what the director attempts to cast later. If the idea is that they are a pair of brainless imps that go around doing stupid things that we cannot help but laugh at because it is so well done then so be it. But when the plot gets in full swing somehow we are expected to believe that the same pair are now naturally so damn cool that the whole of the US just falls for them. Another thing that got me was that they fell far short of the level of cool or wit required to make a splash even on a prescripted Cgrade film let alone a national sports event. When I was about 15 or younger I may have chuckled at a few scenes here and there and still walked away from it feeling underdone and I think I am being generous there.".

We are then made to believe he left Bowling to rejoin his friends at there small life.That part bugged me up because he could had be a successful Bowling player without all the partying and stuffand being a douche that took all of his life and the reasons why Lindsay left him. I would had like to see them reunited and win the big match after all this is what made Happy Gilmore so satisfying at the end when he beat Shooter McGavin.But overall its a cool comedy i like to see him and Mike hang out and all definitely worth a look.".

Clayne Crawford as Ross' sidekick Mike completes a trifecta of woeful performances here with an oddly inflected dialect which seems dubbed by a loop group person for whom English is a second language. That director Tommy Reid elicited such a trio of bottomtier efforts is no testimonial to the virtues of Hollywood nepotism and the seemingly endless list of 24 producers including Tara and Tommy prove the adage about too many cooks making a rancid roast.Unfortunately there is no hint that the socalled brains behind 710 SPLIT as STRIKE was initially and more aptly titled were attempting to spoof sports movies though the climax echoes no doubt unintentionally Kevin Costner's golf movie TIN CUP. Instead they seemingly tried to put out a SERIOUS version of stoners meet ROCKY without so much as a Cheech Marin or Burt Young cameo. The best they could do for Tinseltown's senior citizens was a bit part as PBA commissioner by Ray Wise. Every nuance of this movie seems totally predictable from the leads' onandoffandon again relationship to the lonely big mansion scene to the temptations of booze groupies booze drugs booze fameand booze on Ross. Speaking of the devil Ross Patterson wrote the screenplay but if 100 chimps typed at 100 typewriters for 100 hours chances are at least 15 or 20 of them would do better. If I rated on a straight curve STRIKE would merit a 1 or 2 out of 10 so 4 may seem overly generous to some viewers.".

Just like Kingpin this is a bowling comedy with a lot of good bowling that although not perfect is very good. I didn't particularly like this movie. Yes it's dumb but it's entertaining all the same. The movie was not as awful as it could of ended up being but it's not a bad film. The characters are pretty much funny. Look I'm not saying anything great about this in fact it's pretty damn mediocre. That said it's mediocre entertainment.

Great use of a jacket to ward off a street battle and the restaurant fight scene is classic Jet Li you gotta love that shadowless kick.  The Lion dance ceremony was interesting and I enjoyed how chaotic it was as all the dragons battled to get the bait.  Foon adds comic relief and Club Foot was a cool character who knows how to get his kicks.Overall I had to see this one after watching part one and two.

Jet looks fit and is in great fighting shape for the film. However there are no good oneonone battles for him. His duel with Xiong Xin Xin in the street is short and disappointing as is the finale against the head of the oil factory. The lion dance scenes are cool.The story on the other hand is really good. It has just the right amount of romance humor and historical background to sustain itself between the fight scenes. This would be the last of the truly historically relevant entries of the series as the following films were either overthetop or would not even focus on historical matters.Overall this is good watching.

There are some good bits of humor and we see some actual romance between Wong FeiHung and Aunt 13 but I don't think that that sort of thing is the main reason we watch this sort of movie.  And even if it were there's just too little of it.  I really think that Jet Li's talents are wasted when you try to use goofy camera angles to make it look like he's doing superhuman feats.  The man is practically superhuman already.  I think you're better off showing off the amazing things that he can do rather than focusing on trying to make him look like a cartoon.  I'm sure that his work in the movie was very demanding but it just didn't come off as too impressive on the screen in my opinion.  And way too much lion dancing.".

I do understand though why other reviewers might have panned this one  it's much easier to understand tsui hark's intentions from the perspective of someone brought up in a more...

The character of Huang FeiHung is the embodiment of all the values inherent in The Patriot a man unafraid of standing up to oppressive powers foreign or otherwise and fighting for the masses. This theme is emphasized throughout the series and never so welldepicted as in Part III. Spoiler This episode ultimately ends tragically as Wong realises that in fighting to save face and win honour for his people he has in reality failed them. As such the film in a somewhat didactic approach deviates from the stereotypical kungfuherokillsallthebaddiesandsavestheday ending in an attempt to teach its audience just what it really means to fight for your country  that it isn't just scrabbling for some abstract pedantic bragging rights but to be prepared to make sacrifices to bring about change that is real and good. For those who just want to watch some chopsocking action catch the first film. But if you're looking for some insight into the source of Chinese nationalistic fervour and what drives a man to put everything at stake for family and country this really is one of the essentials.".

	schema:headline " Very enjoyable film that stands well with it's predecessors";
	schema:reviewBody "In order to demonstrate a show of strength to the foreigners the Empress decrees a Lion King competition between the various martial arts schools. Wong Feihung returns home at this time to visit his father's school to find that the TaiPing school have set out to destroy the other schools before the competition itself.  Feihung tries to bring peace between the schools but fails to stop the contest.  Meanwhile Cousin  suspects something more sinister going on around the contest.I feel like I'm under pressure here to say this isn't as good as the previous two films simply because that seems to be the consensus of opinion on among reviewers here and also conventional wisdom says that a series will lose quality as it goes along.  I settled to watch this expecting to be a drop from parts I  II both of which I enjoyed however I must say I found it to be every bit as enjoyable as part II which I considered a more enjoyable film than part I.  I do however recognise that it has weaknesses over the other two films.First off the plot is significantly weaker and even needs a last minute conspiratorial shot in the arm to help up the drama and give the characters something extra to do.  That said I still felt the film moved along well and wasn't too bothered by the lack of a real strong structure.  The fights are free flowing and enjoyable even if they have weak reasons for occurring sometimes.  There is no one fight that really competes with the climax of part I but that doesn't mean they're bad.  Certainly fans of Matrix and Crouching Tiger who think this stuff is all a new invention! will be impressed as indeed was I.  The Lion King contest has been criticised for hiding the skills of the actors but I think it made for a different show of skill that did involve their martial arts skills and showed them in a big way.  There are some scenes that are too clearly wirework although it is all wire work but the majority of it flows very well.The main reason this film worked well for me was the way that it kept the humour from part II.  The gentle comic touches all through are laughoutloud funny and really binds the whole film together.  I've always felt that part II's humour made it better than part I and part III continues that well.  The romance between Feihung and cousin is also played well for both laughs and romance.The main reason the comedy works so well is the cast who all show a real skill for it.  Mok's Yoon is the main reason for this and his little touches are great fun to watch.  Jet Li also shows a real ability in comic acting that Hollywood has spectacularly failed to utilise thus far.  His interaction with the excellent Kwan brings a real spark to the film in the quieter scenes.  His real skill of course is the martial arts and he is a real presence in every action scene.  The addition of Iron Foot Xiong works well and he is a good character who is developed past the bad guy character he is first presented as.Overall I can understand why many would feel that this is a lesser film but I must say that I find it hard to put a wedge between any of the first three in the series I have only seen these thus far.  However I enjoyed the action and felt that the comic touches worked very well and made this a very enjoyable film that was very easy to watch.  The plot may be weaker than the previous films but it has other strengths that are used well.  I can't comment on the rest of the series but this film made parts IIII a very strong and enjoyable series of films.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the most satisfying resolutions to a trilogy I have ever seen. Makes me recall the ending to THE WONDERFUL COUNTRY starring Bob Mitchum where when you came to the ending you KNEW it was over. When the hero of the piece appeals for education over reward for martial prowess you have something special on your hands. The ending of ONCE UPON A TIME IN CHINA III will stay with me for a long time.The thing that stands out for me is the characters this time. I really don't want to say too much as that would spoil all the fun. The Dowager Empress reminds me of my INTRODUCTION TO THE NOVEL teacher Miss Gomez and my Cub Scout Den Mother Mrs. Dubose. I loved all the colors of the costumes and the masks. At times it was almost a comment on the spectacular martial arts fights and stunts making them at times seem childish and cartoonish. The characters are every one of them painted with a broad brush but it was exhilarating to see that Tsui Hark was relying very thoroughly on Chinese theatrical traditions and not going out of his way to cater to Western tastes and appetites. A great judgment call in my estimation because you really come to feel warmly for all the characters as though you've finally come to know them at the end.I must say Rosamund Kwan comes across as more beautiful and glamorous in this third installment than ever before and very nearly steals the show. Unlike a 'Bond Girl' whom we know will only be eye candy and 007's sexual conquest for a single adventure we are now seeing Aunt 13 for the third time and the sense of chemistry and monogamy between her and Wong FeiHung is stronger than ever. I cannot easily remember where I have seen romantic character development across three movies like this.Love the chaos of the climatic scene at the Lion Dance competition! It seems so intricate that you just know some parts of it required improvisation to tie up inevitable loose ends. It is wild and woolly and filled with all kinds of color in motion like a circus parade unraveling itself. You truly have no idea what is going to happen next or what direction it will be coming from and you also have a sneaking suspicion that some of the actors feel this way as well as they are just trying this out that way and then trying that out this way through the various takes. The choreography of this feels like something that would defy even Hitchcock's attempts at storyboarding although I cannot vouch for how true that might be. But that wordless comment 'what the hell is going on???!!' definitely comes to mind to this viewer with thrilling giddy glee. This seems so suggestive of the internal social and political turmoil that Chinese society must have been experiencing at this time.Leave it to our hero Wong FeiHung to make sense out of all this somehow and bring order to this seemingly inexhaustible bedlam and melee. That he does indeed seem to do so and even gives the moral of the story to the audience in a way that is far from cheesy with nary a hair out of place in his Confucian reserve is a delight to behold. He marches away with polite indignation and we are called to stand in our hearts to a hero's anthem that exhorts us to improve ourselves every day.Here at the end you feel this is what Wong FeiHung means to the Chinese people. This is their culture hero who will always exhort them to educate themselves to be better than they are.May I be excused?".

Jet Li acted too dramatic in his role and Xin Xin Xiong acted like he was angry at the entire world  too vengeful and too full of uncontrollable rage.The music score is also well played especially the toe tapping and theme sung by George Lam.

	schema:headline " Not up to the quality of the first two films but still good fun";
	schema:reviewBody "The third film in the Jet Li series is very much a minor movie in comparison to the first two with a plot that simply rehashes the old EastmeetsWest theme throws in some very average comedy some nice romantic touches between the two leads and some enjoyable action sequences. One thing missing from the previous adventures is Yuen Wooping who went elsewhere leaving the action choreography to somebody else. The resulting fight sequences are just as lavish as before but more obviously involve wire work this time Li is a superhero who can jump ten feet in the air and there's a villain called Iron Foot who can fly with his feet.The story is pretty unchallenging involving an evil factory owner and a Russian agent with a dark secret. Props feature strongly this time a camera and those Chinese dragons which take centre stage at the film's climatic Lion King contest. This climax is a bit of a disappointment as Li and his opponents are hidden inside massive dragon costumes for the most part and it lacks the dramatic power of a oneonone battle like the previous movies offered. However Tsui Hark does offer something a bit more original and what it lacks in dynamism it makes up for in sheer visual spectacle.Rosamund Kwan is probably the best thing in this film having some very sweet moments with Li who is good but appears to be going through the motions it's no wonder he left the series as he's had no character progression for two movies now. One actor who is very good indeed is newcomer to the series Xi Xi Xiong DOUBLE TEAM as villain Iron Foot who has some fantastic wireaided action moments and is easily the most memorable thing in the film. There are some 'fun' martial arts bits that make use of some imaginative scenarios. One has Li on an oilslicked floor dodging missiles whilst another sees him battling swordsmen using only his coat. There's a bit of blood and guts including a pretty shocking mangled leg shot and the classic Wong Feihung theme music is back infrequently. Although this film offers absolutely nothing new to the series or the genre as a whole Hark's lavish choreography and production values make it a very agreeable viewing experience.".

	onyx:emotionText "The third film in the Jet Li series is very much a minor movie in comparison to the first two with a plot that simply rehashes the old EastmeetsWest theme throws in some very average comedy some nice romantic touches between the two leads and some enjoyable action sequences. One thing missing from the previous adventures is Yuen Wooping who went elsewhere leaving the action choreography to somebody else. The resulting fight sequences are just as lavish as before but more obviously involve wire work this time Li is a superhero who can jump ten feet in the air and there's a villain called Iron Foot who can fly with his feet.The story is pretty unchallenging involving an evil factory owner and a Russian agent with a dark secret. Props feature strongly this time a camera and those Chinese dragons which take centre stage at the film's climatic Lion King contest. This climax is a bit of a disappointment as Li and his opponents are hidden inside massive dragon costumes for the most part and it lacks the dramatic power of a oneonone battle like the previous movies offered.

While it was very weak in storyline it more than made up for the shortcoming in action and Chinese lion sequences.It seemed like the storyline was rushed through and that most of the movie had a script that was just made up as director Tsui Hark went along with shooting the film. But luckily the impressive action and martial arts were more than making up for it. It should also be said that there is a lot of scenes and fighting sequences with Chinese lions. So take that into consideration if you might have a problem with that.Jet Li delivers quite well once again despite not having much of a solid and proper script to work with. So Once Upon a Time in China 3 aka Wong Fei Hung III Si wong jaang ba seems mostly like a showcase for Jet Li's martial arts skills.This is not one of the brightest moments in Hong Kong cinema nor in Tsui Hark's directing career.Once Upon a Time in China 3 is a movie mostly appealing only to fans of Jet Li.".

While breakdancer Club Foot does some incredible kicks his character really drops low in the last half hour of the movie and you wonder why the directors make him do what he does.  Jet Li does some incredible fighting as the famous Wong FeiHung but I was truly hoping that Tianbao from Tai Ji Zhang San Feng would come in and start a GOOD fight amidst all this liondancing crap.

Once again the film is based around foreigners taking over China but this storyline gets a bit silly after a while because people are fighting each other for no reason. I was hoping to see some of the old characters from the first movie but the director chose to stick with the annoying sidekick from the second one. I did like Thunder Foot who looked pretty strange but his martial arts skills was brilliant. In all I was very disappointed with the film especially because the first one was so good. Disappointing!RoundUp They should have called this movie Return Of The Strings because some of the action scenes was ridiculous. The fighting in midair went way too far and a lot of the action was unrealistic. I doubt that I'll be watching any of the other movies in this franchise because it went downhill after the first movie and they also don't star Jet Li. Once I started to see the flying in the air I knew that the rest of the movies might go down this road so I've chosen to stay away from them.Budget NA Worldwide Gross HK27.5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their Jet Li movies and who are familiar with this franchise. 210".

What the film is really about is the relation between the girl from Amsterdam and the Norwegian trapper. The great differences between the young girl and the older and shy trapper leads to many troubles. Over the whole the movie is quite average but the great filming locations and the effort of director Coninx to make a romantic movie here  apart from another film about polar bears  makes this film very special.".

What the film is really about is the relation between the girl from Amsterdam and the Norwegian trapper. The great differences between the young girl and the older and shy trapper leads to many troubles. Over the whole the movie is quite average but the great filming locations and the effort of director Coninx to make a romantic movie here  apart from another film about polar bears  makes this film very special.";

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw When the Light Comes on television late night movies six years ago. Due to the usual timing problems associated with the late night presentation the ending was cut off. I waited unsuccessfully since then for this film to reappear. Apparently it's only available on DVD as a PAL European version so I had to wait until I found a Regionfree DVD player so I could see the whole movie.I'm glad I did because the ambiguous ending minimizes the film's other imperfections. Do the ending scenes with Ellen and Lars playing snow golf show that Ellen did return to Spitzbergen to live with Lars? Did Ellen return to Robert and are the ending scenes just Ellen's happy memories? The book might provide a clue but it's never been translated to English so North Americans who don't speak Dutch are left to ponder the ambiguous ending. Maybe people from the Netherlands are also out of luck as I can't locate a Dutch version either.The European version DVD doesn't come with English subtitles just in Dutch or German. That's a small impediment because most of the film's dialogue is in English. In my case I could remember the Dutch dialogue from the English subtitles in the TV version. It consists mostly of Ellen's feelings in letters to Robert which you can sense from the action and the English portions boring stuff for a guy. As a bonus the European version includes the story how the movie was made. This is mostly in the Dutch language but many scenes are in English because not all the crew and actors spoke Dutch.Some reviews of the movie commented on Francesca's lack of experience when this movie was made. I think it worked in this movie as it could be a part of Ellen's initial awkwardness at the strange situation of a young woman being cooped up for months with an older man. Joachim Krl is an experienced actor. I don't know how he was able to speak English with a Norwegian accent when he sounds quite German in real life. Check out his accent in English in the Special Features.This is not a classic movie but it is much better than average. It's well worth the effort of finding a copy.".

An ostensible thriller set in the affiliated worlds of high finance and high class prostitution it seemed pretty much ripped from the day's headlines as French government was still trying to bring the real life Madame Claude  whose real name's Fernande Grudet  to justice mostly consisting of back taxes she had managed to dodge procuring for the high and mighty criminals and influential politicians alike under the cover of a Paris modeling agency. Therein lies one of the film's chief weaknesses. With dust yet to settle on the court case the movie's attempted sensationalism including the expected characterizations  clef to avoid prosecution gets thwarted at every turn by the director's languorous style best suited to the type op upmarket porn  with literary pedigree as security blanket  his reputation stems from. Fortunately the subject allows for frequent skin display if rather more discreetly than usual the film being passed by the admittedly liberal French ratings commission for ages 13 and over ! An international all star cast was attracted to add luster to what might have emerged as mere tabloid exploitation and probably would have been a lot more fun if it were. Algerian born Franoise Fabian was already a highly respected movie matron having worked with the likes of Eric Rohmer MY NIGHT AT MAUD'S and Luis Bunuel BELLE DE JOUR. She brings authority and natural superiority to the underwritten title role leaving the Mme Claude enigma intact qualities not gone undetected by the ever derivative Italians with Armando Nannuzzi rushing his too similar to be a coincidence LOVE BY APPOINTMENT into production with the same actress. Claude caters to the world's wealthy and powerful sweetening many a business deal with her girls' carnal charms until the Lockheed scandal involving not quite on the level government aircraft acquisition and its subsequent CIA investigation makes the ground a little too hot under her feet. A paparazzo who has bent the rules a bit too often to suit his own needs David Evans British Murray Head the unforgettable bisexual love object from John Schlesinger's once scandalous Sunday BLOODY Sunday uses his connection to Claude  his current squeeze being her best girl AnneMarie Swedish Vibeke Knudsen from Grard Pirs silly porn parody ATTENTION LES YEUX !  to garner info to buy his way out of his predicament.Gorgeous Canuck Dayle Haddon who went from Disney making her debut opposite JanMichael Vincent in their wholesome THE WORLD'S GREATEST ATHLETE to dirty playing the highly physical title roles in both Aldo Lado's LA CUGINA and Charles Matton's space 'n' sex opera SPERMULA in record time will stop a few hearts as Claude's reluctant new protge Elizabeth. Trained by the Madame's close friend Pierre the late Maurice Ronet Fabian's costar from Michel Deville's RAPHAEL OU LE DEBAUCHE she's assigned to take the virginity of young Frdric an early role for much praised stage and screen thespian Pascal Greggory who did some of his best work for Patrice Chreau in LA REINE MARGOT and the sulfurous GABRIELLE son of Greek shipping magnate Alexander Zakis played by Polish born Klaus Kinski famed for his idiosyncratic contributions to German and Italian cinema in the surf of a sundrenched isle while Jane Birkin breathlessly warbles the Serge Gainsbourg composed theme song Yesterday Yes a Day. As if there weren't enough nationalities swarming about to keep track of already there's an Arab prince who likes to watch girls making it with each other shocking I know ! and much missed Robert Webber as a pantysniffing US senator ! There's good reason why I haven't elaborated upon the details that bring about Claude's downfall as they involve the usual incriminating photo evidence and double crosses you will find in any run of the mill policier eating up way too much screen time. Though Jaeckin wouldn't know suspense if it jumped out of the proverbial toilet and bit him he does manage at least one memorable set piece as wounded Murray Head giving a commendably intense performance tries in vain to get help from the oblivious participants at an orgy only to breathe his last as dawn approaches. Finally given something more to do than arranging pretty naked girls in titillating tableaux vivants ace DoP Robert Fraisse  who sandwiched this one between similar skin flicks EMMANUELLE 2 and ONE TWO TWO RUE DE PROVENCE  mines the scene for all the doomladen atmosphere he can muster signaling the end of the French everything goes era the local sex industry growing ever more stringently governmentregulated in years to come more eloquently than the insipid drama that surrounds it. Even though commercially not on a par with Jaeckin's previous blockbusters it still did well enough to beget an official sequel Franois Mimet's MADAME CLAUDE 2 natch as well as inspire many followers the best of which might be LES FILLES DE MADAME CLAUDE aka CONTES PERVERS credited to famed erotica publisher Rgine Deforges yet actually directed by our old friend Michel Lemoine.".

She brings authority and natural superiority to the underwritten title role leaving the Mme Claude enigma intact qualities not gone undetected by the ever derivative Italians with Armando Nannuzzi rushing his too similar to be a coincidence LOVE BY APPOINTMENT into production with the same actress. Claude caters to the world's wealthy and powerful sweetening many a business deal with her girls' carnal charms until the Lockheed scandal involving not quite on the level government aircraft acquisition and its subsequent CIA investigation makes the ground a little too hot under her feet. A paparazzo who has bent the rules a bit too often to suit his own needs David Evans British Murray Head the unforgettable bisexual love object from John Schlesinger's once scandalous Sunday BLOODY Sunday uses his connection to Claude  his current squeeze being her best girl AnneMarie Swedish Vibeke Knudsen from Grard Pirs silly porn parody ATTENTION LES YEUX !  to garner info to buy his way out of his predicament.Gorgeous Canuck Dayle Haddon who went from Disney making her debut opposite JanMichael Vincent in their wholesome THE WORLD'S GREATEST ATHLETE to dirty playing the highly physical title roles in both Aldo Lado's LA CUGINA and Charles Matton's space 'n' sex opera SPERMULA in record time will stop a few hearts as Claude's reluctant new protge Elizabeth. Trained by the Madame's close friend Pierre the late Maurice Ronet Fabian's costar from Michel Deville's RAPHAEL OU LE DEBAUCHE she's assigned to take the virginity of young Frdric an early role for much praised stage and screen thespian Pascal Greggory who did some of his best work for Patrice Chreau in LA REINE MARGOT and the sulfurous GABRIELLE son of Greek shipping magnate Alexander Zakis played by Polish born Klaus Kinski famed for his idiosyncratic contributions to German and Italian cinema in the surf of a sundrenched isle while Jane Birkin breathlessly warbles the Serge Gainsbourg composed theme song Yesterday Yes a Day. As if there weren't enough nationalities swarming about to keep track of already there's an Arab prince who likes to watch girls making it with each other shocking I know ! and much missed Robert Webber as a pantysniffing US senator ! There's good reason why I haven't elaborated upon the details that bring about Claude's downfall as they involve the usual incriminating photo evidence and double crosses you will find in any run of the mill policier eating up way too much screen time. Though Jaeckin wouldn't know suspense if it jumped out of the proverbial toilet and bit him he does manage at least one memorable set piece as wounded Murray Head giving a commendably intense performance tries in vain to get help from the oblivious participants at an orgy only to breathe his last as dawn approaches. Finally given something more to do than arranging pretty naked girls in titillating tableaux vivants ace DoP Robert Fraisse  who sandwiched this one between similar skin flicks EMMANUELLE 2 and ONE TWO TWO RUE DE PROVENCE  mines the scene for all the doomladen atmosphere he can muster signaling the end of the French everything goes era the local sex industry growing ever more stringently governmentregulated in years to come more eloquently than the insipid drama that surrounds it. Even though commercially not on a par with Jaeckin's previous blockbusters it still did well enough to beget an official sequel Franois Mimet's MADAME CLAUDE 2 natch as well as inspire many followers the best of which might be LES FILLES DE MADAME CLAUDE aka CONTES PERVERS credited to famed erotica publisher Rgine Deforges yet actually directed by our old friend Michel Lemoine.";

Officially Fabian is Madame Claude the owner of a Parisian modeling agency. It is an open secret however that her operation actually traffics in expensive call girls for the wealthy and powerful. Some of these girls will undergo blackmail because David photographer of trade has images of these Johns in compromising positions. An awesome erotic film that shows all the actresses on different stages of undress. One of the greatest sex scenes ever taking place early on in a hot tub.".

It seemed to be one of those taxsaving efforts in which actors participate for nice money only and no redeeming value whatsoever.I was wrong. It is mostly a thriller and the thriller part works very nicely. I've been told that Ed Bishop could be utterly chilling on stage but here he definitely put this on screen. Never to utter a word aloud his quiet slender and completely unassuming killer Smith is quite frightening. Bishop's performance is absolutely on par with that of Alain Delon in Le Samourai given that he manages to bring this over with much less screen time. Klaus Kinski delivers a toned down performance one would not readily believe him capable of yet he too comes over ruthless brutal and at the same time refined during those scenes when David stumbles past the orgy near the end. Maurice Ronet is as brilliant as Bishop in this. His initiation scene with the novice callgirl Elizabeth certainly belongs to the most erotic scenes in this movie and holds its own with quite some of what was filmed around the same time e.g. La Piscine.I enjoyed the movie. Yes there's loads of nudity and sex in it but no more than what was common in many similar and much better known movies of the time. The actors deliver solid to brilliant performances kudos to Jaekin for coaxing that from them and the thriller works and ends in a very dark scene.".

I would have liked them to just call it Havana Nights instead because many people have high expectations about it because of the title. If you liked the first Dirty Dancing you will love this.

BUT I am really glad that I did. I loved this movie! I really liked the story line and it also gave me a brief glimpse of the history of Cuba. That in itself made it one of my new favorite movies. Combine this with the music and the awesome dancing and it becomes a fantastic movie. I am not going to compare it to the first DD movie. It deserves to be set out on it's own. It is definitely worthy. The young actors do an awesome job of portraying the characters in this movie. This is a movie that I would like to own and I don't feel that way about a lot of movies. Congratulations to the producers directors and all of those involved I will be recommending this one to friends and family.".

	schema:headline " Bogus Latin dancing film.";
	schema:reviewBody "My biggest gripe with this movie is that the Latin dancing is not very genuine. My father was living in Havana in the early 1960s and reports what seems pretty obvious this film is full of a modern highly stylized and hiphoppified version of Cuban street dancing.But there is a lot of other stuff to gripe about in this film.Plot our heroine is an American gringa whose family moves to prerevolutionary Cuba because her dad's company promoted him to a position there. We don't know anything about our heroine let's call her La Gringa Caliente because she eventually learns to loosen up and let strange men touch her butt except that she gets good grades. So she moves to Havana and becomes mesmerized by afroCubano dancing. This leads her to fall madly in love with a waiter in her hotel and enter a dance tournament with him. Her family is scandalized. Then they are not scandalized any more.The plot is totally predictable and the acting is downright bad. The love story lacks guts. None of that matters if what you want is to see cool Latin dancing and listen to cool Latin music which was my goal. But even that goal is sadly disappointed here. There is some cool music but most of the music is just hiphop with a Latin beat. A lot of the dancing is just 2000's club freakdancing... it looks more like Lambada than Samba.The three features that pushed me from silent disappointment to derisive laughter were1 They make a big deal about Old Havana and show all of these landscape shots to impress the viewer. But the city they are showing is San Juan Puerto Rico! This might not be so obvious but they show the most famous landmarks in San Juan so that you cannot possibly even pretend the setting is Havana. So much for the Havana Nights.2 For some Godawful reason they throw Patrick Swayze back in! First of all his character has no role no background and no reason to be there. He plays the gringo dance teacher who somehow teaches La Gringa Caliente how to loosen up and let guys touch her butt he has a great line It can be very scary when someone touches that part of your body. who wrote this?. They dance around ballroom style. Second the guy has had a really bad facelift or something. He was only 52 when this film came out but he looks 65. I was worried that his hairpiece was going to come flying off during some of the spins.3 The pathetically weak attempt to illustrate the social pressures that led to the Cuban revolution left in me stitches.Conclusion stink bomb. If you want a movie with cool Cuban music rent Buena Vista Social Club. If you want to watch cool Latin dancing rent the 1980s Robby Rosa film Salsa! If you have a desperate need to get rid of four dollars and be bored for 90 minutes rent Dirty Dancing Havana Nights.".

The lead pair Diego Luna and Romola Garai share a nice chemistry. Not only is Garai beautiful but she can act too as she delivers a sincere performance. Diego Luna does his part well although in a few scenes he does seem to have difficulty with some expressions. Sela Ward is alright in a minuscule part.

	schema:reviewBody "If your expecting a carbon remake of the original Dirty Dancing then you will be sorely disappointed as although Dirty Dancing Havana Nights shares the same plot and name there are few similarities between the two movies. The styles are completely different and both hold their own individual kind of magic that captures the hearts of the viewers.The dancing has few fancy tricks and the music is more of a dance beat then unforgettable hit however the simple elegance and hot moves will leave the breathless. It oversteps some of the marks the original barely touched upon the phrase Dirty Dancing comes into play as a strong theme of the dance. The dancing shows a way of rebellion where they enter there own world and dance their own steps it shows the process of growing up and the parents fight to keep their baby that a lot of teenage girls face.Although the dancing is memorable although in my opinion there is not enough the main theme seems to be the setting. The amazing setting of Cuba is a brilliant setting the colourful surroundings bring to life a surreal feeling that captures the summer buzz of the movie perfectly.The politics involved of the revolution manage to reach through this idealistic dream and bring a harsh sense of reality to the movie that in my opinion is very interesting.Katey Romola Garai and Javier Diego Luna dance well together. They have an interesting chemistry although not as prominent as the characters interaction in the original which is a slight disappointment. The dialogue at times can sound slightly false however is usually soon made up for. Sela Ward and John Slattery who play Katey's parents are brilliant actors that really bring up the movie at times. The movie has many actors that all interact brilliantly and the events that the movie covers are done in a very thought provoking way.Towards the end I felt that it began to lose the quality that it had built throughout the movie namely in the big dancing scene that is slightly disappointing. However it is rescued by the ending that provides a powerful reality that wakes them up from the summer dream that the movie seems to build its self into and provides a bittersweet ending that in my opinion is very good although it leaves you wondering what happened next.Overall the movie is well worth seeing it brings together a brilliant story with hot music and a timesetting that is unforgettable once you see it once you'll want to watch again and again.".

However I do feel that the movie could've been better if there'd been more character development and the movie been longer with more detail and if more emotion was put into the end.I don't know how Romola pulled off hiding her heavy British accent but she definitely convinced me. I don't think she was very convincing as an actress while saying some of her lines though. However I think she is the best one for the part. She's a very good dancer and just everything about her makes her right for the role.For those of you who want to find the same passion that Diego and Romola have in the movie who wouldn't want that??? it's not easy. Dance studios like Arthur Murray just teach you the basics of dance and although there is Latin dancing taught there you will never find that kind of dancing in a studio like that. So I recommend not getting your hopes up before taking ballroom lessons because they are just the basics of dance.".

	schema:reviewBody "In November 1958 the American teenager Katey Miller Romola Garai moves with her parents and her younger sister to Havana. Her father is an executive of Ford expatriated to Cuba and Katey is an excellent high school senior student that misses her friends. The family is lodged in a fancy hotel where Katey accidentally meets the local teenage waiter Javier Suarez Diego Luna. Later she sees Javier dancing in a public square and they become friends but he is fired from the hotel because her acquaintances have seen them together. Katey invites Javier to participate of a Latin Ballroom Contest in the local Palace club to help him to raise some money and she secretly meets him in the La Rosa Negra nightclub for rehearsals. Later they fall in love for each other in times of revolution.I like movies of dance but Dirty Dancing Havana Nights is a wonderful and delightful homage to dance and to the first love that has superseded my best expectations. First it is based on a true story with romance and drama in the historic moment and landscape of the Cuban Revolution inclusive the imported DVD has a beautiful message from the real Katey Miller  actually JoAnn F. Jansen the partner of the dance instructor Patrick Swayze. Then the magnificent chemistry showed between the adorable Romola Garai who gives credibility to her beautiful character with a touching performance and a stunning dance and the great Diego Luna and the cameo appearance of Patrick Swayze. Last but not the least the awesome music and choreography of dances complete this great film. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Dirty Dancing 2  Noites de Havana Dirty Dancing  Havana Nights".

	schema:reviewBody "Dirty Dancing Havana Nights is a film that tried to capitalize on a much better film Dirty Dancing that came out in the eighties. This remake suffers from a lack of vision and political incorrectness so typical with people that have no clue about other cultures as witnessed by the finished product. It's almost incomprehensible that more than 500 contributors to IMDb have given this film a rating of 10 or excellent when it feels fake from the beginning.This film is supposed to take place in Havana during the days before the fall of the Batista regime in 1959. The director Guy Ferlnad and his writers present us a Havana in which dancing takes place in almost any corner as we are taken to watch an impromptu rumba dancing by happy natives in a busy downtown street. The character of Javier the proud pool waiter working for the wealthy Americans in either their club or hotel shows a rebel streak toward his boss and a friendly attitude toward the gorgeous Katey Miller who accepts him as a friend. This situation could only work in the minds of the movie people because in real life Katey couldn't have cared less for the young man let alone be associated with him for any kind of social dancing.In fact there is such sharp contrast between the girl of privilege and a working class poor boy that it would have taken a miracle for bringing them together. Talk about the magic of the movies! This is stretching things a bit too much. Films about Cuba in general always show the fateful 1958 New Year's Eve that changed that land forever. We see it again done here as it's the climax of the dirty dancing competition where Katey and Javier are finalists.As for the dancing the people involved in the film have created a hybrid in trying to present what one sees in the movie for real dancing when this type of sensual dancing didn't come into being until the nineties.Diego Luna is a good actor and does what he can with his Javier. Romola Garai is a beautiful young woman to look at but as far as the dancing she suffers from a lack of rhythm so innate in a Cuban or a Latina and since she is not a dancer she doesn't keep pace with Javier at all. Sela Ward has some good moments as Katey's mother and Patrick Swayze shows up as a dancing instructor.Mr. Ferland the director should have done some research in Miami or another area where Cubans still dance in their own fashion and it would have made up for a better dancing in a film that feels fake from beginning to end.".

But the movie doesn't work because Romola Garai is not just good enough  she's too good. She's too natural too glamorous too selfconfident and too alluring to be believable in the typical dirty dancing scenario.In the original DIRTY DANCING all of the story's power came from the fact that Jennifer Grey's character was a classic ugly duckling  not a golden beauty with natural grace. It was thrilling heartbreaking poignant and funny to watch Baby discover her own sensuality and attractiveness because you could see how shy and awkward she felt.None of that dynamic works in HAVANA NIGHTS. The story lacks power precisely because Romola Garai is a screen natural in a way that Jennifer Grey never was. You never worry about her future. She seems to be so utterly right the moment she steps onto the dance floor. Far from being intimidated by her Cuban partner she seems to be more at home on the dance floor than he is. Her golden regal beauty and bewitching sensuality are so completely radiant and luminous in every scene you never wonder if she'll get the guy. Instead you wonder why she wants a mere boy instead of a grown man of greater animal power and allure! Romola Garai is destined to be a huge star  in this movie she soars to greatness.

But it helped to mainstream Romola Garai in American and will undoubtedly serve as a stepping stone toward larger and better projects.

	schema:reviewBody "Alright well I sat down to watch this movie without having a single clue as to what it was all about. I hadn't read anything about it heard anything about it or even googled it. I just sat down and watched it. I had expected it to be in the comedy corner but it sort of isn't a comedy at all. Nor would I say it is a classic drama but more of a movie about growing as people and coming to terms with whom and what you are.The story in Paper Man is very warm heartfelt and straight forward. It moves forward in a good pace and you are never left bored throughout the course of the movie. Now the movie is obviously kept afloat by the superb acting performances of Jeff Daniels and Emma Stone. I think this is one of the best roles I have ever had the pleasure of seeing Jeff Daniels in. Not saying that his previous work is bad just that this is outstanding. And Emma Stone worked so well opposite Daniels in her role despite being that much younger than Daniels.The role of Ryan Reynolds well it was essential to the movie although I think it would have worked better with an unknown actor for that role. But still Reynolds is not a bad actor but he didn't really shine through in this role at least not for me. Lisa Kudrow performed adequately as well although it did seem like her character didn't come off as strong on the screen as it was intended.You might think a movie like this would be for a female audience but I found it to be very nice as a guy. The story is captivating and the performances are good. The story is not at any point too sassy and at the end of the movie you come to appreciate the movie for what it is. A unique piece of cinema about how people grow.This is definitely not a movie you should let pass you by. Do yourself the favor and sit down to watch it with or without your significant other. This is a very very nice movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Richard Dunn Jeff Daniels is an abortive writer in his 40's. He is unhappily married to Claire Lisa Kudrow who spends most of the time away from their home because of work causing Richard to be left alone feeling lost and lonely and that he has no purpose in life. He has a really annoying fictional friend in superhero Captain Excellent Ryan Reynolds who dictates his life and who always tells him what to do and has done so since Richard was a teenager.When Richard impulsively decides to hire a babysitter even though he and Claire doesn't have any kids he meets teenager Abby Emma Stone who it turns out is struggling with many of the same problems as himself as she is friendless and an only child and also have this imaginary friend Kieran Culkin who tries to control her. But as they grow an unlikely and close friendship they also find hope to get their lives on track. Through laughter deep conversations and exchanging of fantasies they change their lives for both good and bad.I hesitated when I saw this movie in the local store while I looked on its cover. It said Paper Man with a huge picture of Ryan Reynolds in stupid tights and small pictures of Lisa Kudrow Emma Stone and Jeff Daniels surrounding it. It took a lot of strength for me to pick up the cover at all...And while they are on with that stupid cover  on the back it said Jeff Bridges instead of Jeff Daniels. I thought Not very professionally made. And by the way  the first picture on the back shows Daniels riding a grandma's bike. But then again I am a sucker for friendship stories which I could barely learn it was from the small synopsis on the back and I also like Jeff Daniels and Ryan Reynolds  and also Emma Stone  a lot from earlier work. So if these actors agreed to involve it could not be THAT bad. Ergo I gave it a chance.And what a surprise this movie turned out to be! In fact I was blown away. I got to see a heart warming intellectual story with great dialog and for once REAL emotions flashing out of the screen. The manuscript is the best I've seen in a very long time and I hope it's not long until these Mulroney's does something new. And the thing about Daniels riding a grandma's bike  that turned out to be one of the film's main trademarks in a good way.Jeff Daniels is fantastic as the depressed and lonely unhappy married man chasing inspiration and answers whether it is regarding his new book which he struggles to write to use an understatement and his life in general but who finds hope when he meets Stones character. This is something I to be honest can partly relate to from my own life experiences which probably is part of why I liked this as much as I did. Regardless Daniels was at his very best in this movie.So he needs a little push in the right direction. Enter Emma Stone who plays his female contrast. She is very vulnerable has no real friends but a very unsympathetic boyfriend. She is also charming and splendid and Stone played her role tendering and with such great intensity. Her chemistry with Daniels was surprisingly good despite the age difference between the two. Stone without doubt did her best performance this far  including the highly overrated Easy A.Ryan Reynolds... Well he is Ryan Reynolds. With his superb comedic presence and I have to say boyish charm he delivers line after line with such timing that you just have to laugh no matter how stupid some of the jokes are in reality. In other words  he is fantastic and amazingly funny as Daniels' imaginary friend. And the former child star Kieran Culkin as Stones imaginary ditto is about to become an actor of his own and was a breath of fresh air. The only complain I have is Lisa Kudrow's character who was dramaturgically necessary but poorly written. I never quite felt the frustration she must have had with Richard.I could really not see this coming but there is nothing like pleasant surprises. And this was definitely one of them. This is the best dramedy I've seen since Garden State and illustrates the importance of having friends you can trust in tough times and to have a soulmate in your life who just understands you no matter what. I give it a solid 810 and it definitely deserves more acknowledgment in my opinion.And I also found out Never judge a movie by its cover...".

	schema:reviewBody "On the verge of separation from his wife and crippled by harrowing writer's block Richard Dunn Jeff Daniels settles himself into a friend's summer cottage to work on his second novel. His only companion is Captain Excellent Ryan Reynolds a Supermanlike superhero who exists only in Richard's mind. Solitude doesn't seem to do the trick however and he soon finds himself looking for ways to procrastinate. On a trip into town he meets and befriends Abby Emma Stone a local teenager with a haunted past and only one real friend a strange boy named Christopher Kieran Culkin. The two become an unlikely pair and begin to spend more time with each other against the advice of both Captain Excellent and Christopher. Soon Richard is forced to question his life his relationships and his profession.This is a difficult movie to sum up. In essence Paper Man is all about relationships and human interaction though that may seem difficult to comprehend given that one of the characters is a figment of another's imagination. And yet the interconnecting relationships of Richard and Excellent Abby and Christopher and Richard and Abby serve as an illustration of human needs and codependence. None of the main characters are complete persons and as such each needs the other. Directors Kieran and Michele Mulroney give us carefully crafted wellhoned characters that rarely stray from their tendencies as they grow together and therefore apart. Likewise all of the leads give outstanding performances and fit their roles perfectly. Daniels and Stone display a natural chemistry that embraces the oddness of their relationship. For perhaps the first time ever Richard and Abby are allowed to be themselves in each other's company and that comes through beautifully. Stone in particular is perhaps more vulnerable and authentic here than in any other movie she's been a part of. Only Lisa Kudrow feels out of place as Richard's overachieving wife a onedimensional character who at times fits a tired clich than she does embrace real humanity. That's more than a bit of a disappointment given than none of the other characters or their interactions stray into the clich abyss. Paper Man is quirky and original with dark overtones that give it depth and edge and a tremendous collection of talent that doesn't go to waste. Quite frankly I loved this movie and found myself drawn to it with more intensity than just about any film I've seen recently.My site www.thesoapboxoffice.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "I remember seeing a preview for this movie once a while back and thought it looked interesting but then I never heard about it again. While roaming through Netflix one night I came across it in my queue and decided to check it out and very glad that I did.Paper Man is a very charming dramedy with excellent performances by Jeff Daniels and Emma Stone who form a unique friendship that fills the opposite voids each character has in their lives. The type of friendship they form could have easily been ruined by coming off too romantic but both Daniels and Stone teeter the line of awkward and endearing perfectly to keep the dramatic aspects in a comedic tone.Then there's Captain Excellent the imaginary friend to Richard Dunn Jeff Daniels played by Ryan Reynolds. Captain Excellent is the sarcastic voice of reason to Dunn that leads to many comical exchanges between the two. The sarcastic tone of the character plays well into Ryan Reynolds' wheelhouse and because of that I really enjoyed Reynolds in this roll. I thought both he and Daniels were great playing off each other.All in all this is a very solid flick that I would definitely recommend you check out.".

And it is a job well done.This is fantastic indie movie and a strong directorialwriting debut for Kieran and Michele Mulroney. The casting is interesting and diverse adding in the likes of Emma Stone Ryan Reynolds and Kieran Culkin who may I add surprised me very much. Each actor turns in their roles well for what they're meant to be. And I must say the film explores many intriguing concepts of one's mind suggesting also how two people can be so different in age and still relate to how the other is feeling. It is heartfelt and very sentimental. The friendship between Daniels and Stone is sweet and quite emotionally driven. The roles of Reynolds and Culkin add another level to the movie's superiority because they change the film from being your everyday drama among friends and family to a individualistic adventure for one's identity in the cruel place that is the world.A twist toward the end made me give this movie another bonus. It was unpredictable at least for me and allowed everything to tie together.It's definitely above average and a movie I plan on watching many more times in the future. Plus Jeff Daniels always hands in a great act.".

I would have missed one of the better movies I've seen in some time.Like a lot of indie films it wasn't cookie cutter Hollywood but also unlike a lot of indie films it had some real acting talent. I had seen Emma Stone in Easy A for the first time and enjoyed her in that role but didn't see any exceptional talent so I was really amazed at the performance she gave in this movie as it was a much deeper and complicated role. You don't realize how good she is until you've seen the whole film and finally understand the undercurrent that has been present throughout. Jeff Daniels is a veteran actor and it was hard to tell at first if he was filling his role but as the film progresses you realize that Richard is a flawed man and has been for a very long time and it has reached a point where it can't continue and Daniels was Richard. The three remaining characters were really only set dressing but they were instrumental in helping flesh out who Richard and Abby really were.Richard a 40ish writer who has what appears to be writers block meets 17 year old Abby a not too typical teen. There is an almost instant mutual attraction that develops into a unique friendship that is decidedly not sexual.How this friendship develops and how it affects the rest of the characters is what made this movie so enjoyable. See for yourself. Daniels and Stone were excellent together.This film does require a little effort. There are no throw away scenes so if you don't stay with it and pay attention you will have wasted the effort that the writers and actors put into it and probably won't appreciate it. If you have a short attention span or are hooked on Hollywood then don't bother with this one.".

Although the actors obviously really cared about their work in the film there were a few times where reactions didn't seem quite fitting to the situation and there was some lack of character development in minor characters. Some characters seem to be just a bit too unrealistically pathetic and thus unsympathetic not believable characters. Emma Stone is thoroughly enchanting and sensual and believable. Its romantic minus a lot of the pain as it is imbued with a greater sense or philosophy of life and not offensive or raunchy like so many modern romantic comedies. Dreamy. Well paced.".

So he moves to a little rustic house near the ocean in Montauk to be inspired to write a novel with an extinct bird last seen on Long Island as the subject. Claire comes to visit him periodically and she with a lucrative career as a vascular surgeon expects Richard to be productive to get on with writing his book.But Richard has never completely grown up. He has an imaginary friend Ryan Reynolds as Captain Excellent with short bleached blond hair and always wearing his blue and red suit not unlike how Superman appears. His imaginary friend is alternately a blessing and a nuisance. But he still can't get started writing. I don't know what to do with my hands.Local high school girl Emma Stone as Abby gets Richard's attention. Awkwardly he asks her if she can babysit even though he has no children. She shows up isn't too shocked that there is no child to sit she says I have some homework I need to do. But as he goes away for 3 hours doing nothing in particular she gathers whatever ingredients and vegetables she can find in his place and makes a pot of soup. He likes the soup but when she tells him her babysitting fee is 12 per hour he has just bought a 36 dollar pot of soup. This starts the unfolding of the story which basically is Richard and Abby helping each other get over some issues and get on with their lives. They become friends all innocent but they form a bond that neither of them had experienced before.Good movie. SPOILERS The other key character is Abby's friend Kieran Culkin as Christopher. He almost seems to be stalking her she doesn't seem bothered by his presence. Near the end Christopher and Captain Excellent and standing next to each other and communicate with each other. Christopher is Abby's imaginary friend since the time when Abby and her twin sister were swimming in the ocean Abby came back to shore her twin drowned. As the story is wrapping up Richard sends Captain Excellent away he doesn't need him anymore and Abby comes back to her room to find Christoper dead hanging from her ceiling symbolic that she didn't need him anymore.".

Emma Stone has given a Laudable performance as a tormented teenager who is lonely because nobody seems to understand her. Jeff Daniel's character  Richard is failed writer who moves to a place of solitude to work on his second novel. You can tell that he has always been lonely probably because he is weird and likes to keep to himself.. probably because he feels that other people won't understand him.. because he is kind of immature. There he meets Emma Stone's character and on impulse invites her over to his house to baby sit.. although there is no baby.. Thereafter they start meeting frequently basically because they are both lonely and feel that they understand each other. The chemistry between the two is just right.. I wouldn't have had anyone else filling their shoes. Emma Stone has grown as an actor and I would recommend you see this film for her acting. Ryan Reynolds plays Captain Excellent Richard's imaginary friend.. Lisa Kudrow doesn't have much to do in the movie other than the fact that she is the reason Richard is eventually forced to return to reality. The laid back backdrop and the lively background score lend soul to this movie. Its deep so you will have to pay attention..".

Fantastic movie with a great cast.I love the cast that Kudrow got rid of the comedy which she did great though but the serious roles she just kills! At first I thought this friend of Emma Stons was Tobey McGuire but when I heard his voice I knew it was Kieran Culkin. What has this kid grown up! Nowhere to run is a long time ago! The fact that i remember this kind from NWTR and not from Home Alone says something this kid really can act and is not only famous because of his brother. This kid acted great in the movie. Not excellent because of the little space he got due to his role. But the space that he got he used it very well.Now knowing that Reynold was Daniel's imaginary friend and knowing that a heavy weight actor like Culkin was in it it was very simple to figure out that Culkin was Stone's imaginary friend. Was that a pity? No it wasn't still the movie was interesting and great. The most interesting part was to find out where this relationship between Stone and Daniels was going.Great cast great acting great story. A must see! This is real serious stuff.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is a very interesting first attempt at directing by the duo of Michele and Kieran Mulroney. First of all I would say that in terms of the acting the direction of this film brought out the best from this great cast. Jeff Daniels was able to convey a multidimensional personality and was able to shift his emotions quickly in a scene while Emma Stone gave a commendable performance by his side as well. Overall the acting of the film was spoton though my biggest gripe might be with Ryan Reynolds role in the film. There seemed to be a sense that his role was stretched out more for an extended though entertaining gag than for functionality but overall he brought humor to the film. The most comically golden moments of the film didn't come through Reynolds though who couldn't keep up because of both writing and acting talent with Daniels in my opinion. Visually the film was fairly straight forward. Nothing too crazy nothing too edgy a very functional look. The film focused visually on some smaller details and occasional interesting camera placements but in comparison to the unconventional narrative and great performances it wasn't the most noticeable thing happening. It's hard for me to say too much more about the film without getting into the realm of serious spoilers so I'll just say if you're into the whole Sundanceesquire comedyand in this case literally helped along by Sundance's workshops and if you're fortunate enough for this film to make it to your city you should check it out it's a strong film that maybe only suffers the occasional fate of getting lost in itself but in a way that can be charming as it never loses focus for too long.".

	schema:reviewBody "Lost in Juno What tries hard to be Lost in Translation and Juno with a splash of Youth in Revolt and Wonder Boys Paper Man still manages to succeed on the shoulders of the two stars Jeff Daniels and Emma Stone.Sure the story was very well written  though it takes a bit to get off the ground but if not for both the main stars it would've just been a poser of previous independent comingofage films.WriterBlocked Richard Dunn Daniels  wait is there any other kind in films?  moves to an upstate New York small town to finish another novel. His wife Claire Independent Queen Kudrow stays in the city while her husband works alonewell sort of. He brought his from 2nd grade imaginary friend Captain Excellent SuperHero King Reynolds. Afraid to drive well a lot more he rides a tiny bike to town to which he encounters hundredsofyears younger and freespirited and definitely clichd at first Abby Stone who he convinces to babysit for the child he doesn't have.This is where Lost in Translation fits in relatively speaking. Will there be a romance between these MayDecember folks? Will his wife be jealous of someone who wasn't even around when Friends was on NBC? And will her best bud Christopher played wonderfully by Scott Pilgrim Vs The World's Culkin object since he loves her? It's a middleaged comingofage tale that's quite a simple and beautifully shot movie. I didn't find myself rolling in laughter but a lot of it was cute and funny such as the party Richard hosts. Stone was excellent and I look forward to her turn as Mary Jane in the unfortunately unnecessary SpiderMan reboot if that comes to light.Despite the movie's predictable twist and the inevitable outcome  God I wish they'd shock me once in a while with these low budget indie films  the only other downfall was on how hard they tried to be like all other smart comedies. That said this is wholeheartedly recommended because beyond its shortcomings it a very touching and sometimes funny and intelligent.I'm sad to see it didn't do a dime at the boxoffice. This deserves a chance to be seen by many people especially fans of the above mentioned movies. When this does come to video you really should put it at the top of your queue.".

His wife Claire Independent Queen Kudrow stays in the city while her husband works alonewell sort of. He brought his from 2nd grade imaginary friend Captain Excellent SuperHero King Reynolds. Afraid to drive well a lot more he rides a tiny bike to town to which he encounters hundredsofyears younger and freespirited and definitely clichd at first Abby Stone who he convinces to babysit for the child he doesn't have.This is where Lost in Translation fits in relatively speaking. Will there be a romance between these MayDecember folks? Will his wife be jealous of someone who wasn't even around when Friends was on NBC? And will her best bud Christopher played wonderfully by Scott Pilgrim Vs The World's Culkin object since he loves her? It's a middleaged comingofage tale that's quite a simple and beautifully shot movie. I didn't find myself rolling in laughter but a lot of it was cute and funny such as the party Richard hosts. Stone was excellent and I look forward to her turn as Mary Jane in the unfortunately unnecessary SpiderMan reboot if that comes to light.Despite the movie's predictable twist and the inevitable outcome  God I wish they'd shock me once in a while with these low budget indie films  the only other downfall was on how hard they tried to be like all other smart comedies. That said this is wholeheartedly recommended because beyond its shortcomings it a very touching and sometimes funny and intelligent.I'm sad to see it didn't do a dime at the boxoffice. This deserves a chance to be seen by many people especially fans of the above mentioned movies. When this does come to video you really should put it at the top of your queue.";
