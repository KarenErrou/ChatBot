	schema:reviewBody "FujiTV's HERO aired back in 2001 is my favorite conclusionperepisode dorama series of all time and I had an extremely high expectation for this movie. Long story short it met and exceeded my expectations unlike the SP aired in 2006.What I love most about this movie was that after 5 minutes it felt like I was brought back to the world of HERO dorama series. This movie was directed well enough for cinema yet it retained all the great qualities we HERO fans are familiar with from the TV series. A lot of dorama SPs including the HERO SP and movie adaptations have failed in this respect and many others failed to make it to silver screen standards i.e. GTO Saiyuuki even 1L no Namida felt like a madeforTV SP but HERO staff succeeded in this movie where so many others failed. The producers of this film didn't forget about the fans by providing some information for unanswered questions from the dorama series and SP and connects the stories in dorama SP and the movie in a convincing manner. All the main character's funny habits still makes me laugh and the interactions between Kuryuu and Amemiya were great as usual. The chemistry between all the main cast was perfect even after all these years. It must be this bond that united ALL the original cast even after 6 years in which time Abe Hiroshi has become a major presence in Japanese cinema yet still returns in supporting role.The cast in this movie is absolutely incredible with KimuTaku still popular as ever Abe Hiroshi as mentioned Kohinata Fumiyo who has also become a major presence in cinema and TV though still in supporting roles Ayase Haruka and Nakai Kiichi in same character as SP Matsumoto Koushirou multipleawardwinning stage actor 9 years since his last film appearance Tamori the great MC of Wratte Iitomo and Music Station 17 years since his last film appearance even Korean actor Lee Byunghun and many other recognizable faces in supporting roles.Not only did this movie made me laugh and was a star galore there were also many moving and inspirational scenes. The story was very wellwritten and it was very welldirected. The ending completely caught me offguard. I absolutely loved the dorama series' leavetheresttoyourimagination ending but the movie ending was just as good surprise ending fitting for this great franchise. The only thing I didn't like was the lack of Utada Hikaru's Can You Keep a Secret? as theme song understandable but it felt like something was missing and a few unnecessary scenes to recreate the greatest scenes in the dorama series.I've seen MANY dorama series and movies since HERO in 2001 but watching this movie once again reminded me that Kuryuu Kouhei is one of the greatest character ever created by Japanese liveaction writers. I recommend watching the entire dorama series before the movie. It's definitely worth your time.".

	schema:reviewBody "There aren't that many talento in Japan that can genuinely be regarded as superstars but Kimura Takuya is definitely one of them. From Jpop idol as a member of 90s boy band SMAP to model to TV drama hot throb to movie star Kimutaku has done it all. With his boyish good looks charming charisma and decent acting talents he can easily be compared to Tom Cruise Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio and has just as many adoring female Japanese fans. And now he can also add the title of box office king to his resume as his recent movie Hero the theatrical follow up to his immensely popular 2001 TV drama dominated the Japanese box office for six consecutive weeks this past month and earned over 70 million in ticket sales to date.Hero Gekijou Ban Movie Version is a sequel to the hit Fuji TV series Hero which revolved around the character of Kiryu Kohei Kimura a former juvenile delinquent in a rural town in Aomori who turned his life around by studying to become a Public Prosecutor. While he didn't have the elite Todai Tokyo University degrees of his peers nor their stoic character he nonetheless distinguished himself as a caring honest attorney who despite his unconventional quirks he refuses to wear a suit and tie in court or to cut his hair was well respected for his dogged determination sharp intellect and for never giving up on his clients. In further contrast to his partners he also had a willingness to take whatever case however small or trivial.Along with Kimutaku most of the series' stellar cast returns including fellow Ministry of Justice prosecutors Egami Katsumura Masanobu Endo Yashima Norito Shibayama Abe Hiroshi Suetsugu Kohinata Fumiyo Nakamura Otsuka Nene Ushimaru Kadono Takuzo and boss Nabeshima Kodama Kiyoshi. Popular JDorama actress Matsu Takako is also back as conservative Paralegal Amemiya Maiko who pines for Kiryu but is unable to let him know how she feels even after six years.Series director Suzuki Masayuki GTO Long Vacation Shomuni does the directing duties again for the movie and his visual flair and dramatic storytelling style is once again in full effect. I had a hard time however believing in the complex scandal at the center of screenwriter Fukuda Yasushi's story which involved a mugging incident that went horribly wrong and which surprisingly leads up to a political coverup involving bribery and intimidation.Kiryu's latest legal opponent comes in the form of the brilliant former Deputy Prosecutor Harvard Law school graduate and now high priced Defense Attorney Gamo great character actor Matsumoto Koshiro who is also Matsu Takako's real life father who is mysteriously hired to defend the mugging suspect. When the true villain is revealed to be a corrupt politician portrayed by Morita Kazuyoshi AKA the comedian Tamori one can't but laugh. With his trademark sunglasses firmly in place I couldn't believe Tamori to be the villain even with his uncharacteristic serious character's tone and demeanor it's like asking Jay Leno or David Letterman to appear in a movie as a villain. The whole side trip to Korea while interesting seemed also to be out of place with the rest of the movie. Although I liked seeing Byunghun Lee J.S.A.Joint Security Area in a small cameo role it would have been nice if he had more to do. Nakai Kiichi is wasted in his cameo as well as a former client who is serving time in a penitentiary. Hero is basically a movie made for Kimutaku fans. With his cool fashion sense and looks he carries the film and is its main draw and focus. While he is good in his scenes in court it's his comedic moments that are the most enjoyable especially the running gags involving all the junk he has purchased through a cable TV shopping network a Let's Learn Spanish set a torsostomach exercising gizmo and a balancing exercise device.Kimura and Matsu have a great onscreen chemistry together and their scenes are fun to watch especially their brief trip to Korea. Their lovehate relationship is reminiscent of Bruce WillisCybill Shepherd in Moonlighting although not as cocky.Abe Katsumura Yashima and Kohinata also supply funny comedic moments but it's Masana Bokuzou's Barney Fifelike capitol security guard and Tanaka Yoji's meanlooking but good hearted bartender who are the standouts. As with other TV shows turned movies Unfair Tokyo Friends Bayside Shakedown and GTO fans of the TV series will probably enjoy the movie a bit more than nonfans but Hero does what it sets out to do and does it competently but don't expect the film to go beyond what was already done on TV.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Hero";
	schema:reviewBody "Movies based on successful television series are natural progressions to make a quick buck mainly because of the more instant box office dollars it gets translated to. But what I apprehend the most is when the approach is to not worry whether nontelevision series followers would be able to get it so it decides not to afford the time to explain matters expecting the bulk of the audience to be coming with background knowledge from the series. When you are one of the series' followers you'll make camp on the side to forgo previous cinematic time on explanation so that the pace does not get slowed but if you are not then you'll probably cry foul not that you don't get to enjoy the movie though but are lusting after a more complete experience.For example the XFiles movie requires prerequisite knowledge as did the Japanese movie Mushishi. But there are some which still managed to only require the most basic level of understanding and to use a Japanese reference I enjoyed the Bayside Shakedown movies tremendously. Did I enjoy Hero? Sure but there were enough moments in the movie where you can't help but want to pull your hair in frustration especially when it comes to bit appearances by minor characters whom you'll most certainly deem important enough to warrant significant subplot time in the narrative.Hero is similar to structure with Bayside Shakedown in that on the surface it contains one major plot with the rest of the supporting subplots inevitably linked to the one big one thereby giving reason for the ensemble cast to exist. Takuya Kimura whom we last saw as a samurai in Yoki Yamada's Love and Honor returns to his 2001 television role as Public Prosecutor Kohei Kruyu a devoted gogetter who is unorthodox in his ways aren't they all?. Assisting him is his trustworthy legal clerk Amamiya Maiko Takako Matsu and together they take on a rather routine openandshut case involving manslaughter especially with a written confession provided. But there's more than meets the eye to the supposedly simple case and soon enough they find their legal battle spiral to involve scandals of government officials and have to go up against a top legal eagle who used to be on the payroll of the Public Prosecutor office.Bayside Shakedown provided some criticisms to the police system highlighting the struggles and battles between the bureaucrats in the department and those on the beat handling day to day routine and sometimes mundane police work. I thought Hero could have upped the ante if it debated on the judicial system providing some insight on how things work rather than just a basic introduction. It lapsed into moralistic viewpoints should this be a perfect world with perfect systems and very often reminded the audience that Justice is Blind with the frequent shots of a statue of Justice holding up the scales.But not everything's serious and full of legal jargon and mumbojumbo. Credit has to be given in weaving a more than compelling investigative and legal drama with romantic tension between Amamiya and Kohei as well as plenty of comedy. Those television sellavision ads are so funny they are a highlight in the movie I'm not sure if these are regular features in the television series? and it managed to work into its narrative an explanation of its absence for 6 years since the television series ended and the characters naturally being aged. Familiar to me in this movie are the actors Hiroshi Abe and Korean actor Lee Byunghun who has so minor a role combined screen time of less than 5 minutes I'm not sure why the trailer had to hype about it rather than to keep it a guessing game is he? or isn't he?.However that is not to say that Hero is a bad film. It still offers decent entertainment especially for those who are fans of the many stars it has in its ensemble and for those who like this genre of legal investigative movies. Recommended.".

Those television sellavision ads are so funny they are a highlight in the movie I'm not sure if these are regular features in the television series? and it managed to work into its narrative an explanation of its absence for 6 years since the television series ended and the characters naturally being aged. Familiar to me in this movie are the actors Hiroshi Abe and Korean actor Lee Byunghun who has so minor a role combined screen time of less than 5 minutes I'm not sure why the trailer had to hype about it rather than to keep it a guessing game is he? or isn't he?.However that is not to say that Hero is a bad film. It still offers decent entertainment especially for those who are fans of the many stars it has in its ensemble and for those who like this genre of legal investigative movies. Recommended.";

I cried when it was in the theatres in 1986 and I've seen it maybe 10 times now  and it gets me each and every time as if I were watching for the very first time!  Sorry to drone on but it has just the right touch  you've heard a lot of comparisons with Back to the Future  believe me it isn't!  If you liked the two movies I mentioned in my header especially Frequency since it is about to be released on video  you will love this film!Kathleen Turner was excellent  I have seen Debra Winger originally scheduled to play the title role in several films including Terms of Endearment and though I respect her as an actress she just couldn't have done this part justice.  Nicolas Cage was great in his role  the whiny voice was a bit much  but it's hard to believe he was only 21 when this film was made.  He plays a high school kid and a guy in his 40's equally well  he's always had a gift for that.  Jim Carrey  then mostly unknown  displays some of the physical slapstick routines that would later earn him praise and renown.  Then there's Joan Allen  as I saw this movie for the first time I thought how much she resembled former first lady Pat Nixon in her earlier years  and sure enough that's who she played in Oliver Stone's Nixon.  Helen Hunt portrays Kathleen Turner and Nicolas Cage's daughter  ironic since she is older than Cage!  It was one of her beginning roles as well.Without a doubt the scenes with Peggy Sue and her grandparents are the most touching in the whole film.  Think about it  if you had the chance to see someone again who had died long before what would you say to them?  What would you do?  This wonderful film gives us the chance to find out.Will Peggy Sue Got Married ever be available on videocassette for home purchase again?  I hate to have to rent it each time I want to see it!".

Jim Carrey is here as well and surprise he's overacting in most of his scenes!  While I've never completely figured out why Nicholas Cage was encouraged to employ the weirdass voice that he did his performance winds up being very likeable.  Barry Miller is also great as Richard.The premise is cool.  Who among us wouldn't want to have such and opportunity OK maybe not the passing out in public part?

	schema:reviewBody "Maybe I am a bit prejudiced about the greatness of this film I grew up in Sonoma County and the sight of Peggy Sue Kelcher standing on the senior steps at Santa Rosa High School where I drop off my granddaughters every morning gives me a great thrill. When I drop them off I often say If you see Peggy Sue tell her I said hello. And they respondWe will grandpa. And they no doubt think What an old cornball. What a beautiful school! And it still looks just the same as it did in the 80's or the 60's for that matter. The place seems to be in a time warp. In a certain sense taking this movie to heart has mythologized my world. Francis Ford Coppola's talent for finding the perfect settings for his comic philosophic masterpiece is unerring throughouteven if he had to paint the streets in Petaluma purple just to get the exact effect that he wanted.Peggy Sue would be very high on my alltime top 100 film list if I had such a list. The film is not only funny and soulful it also directly addresses what is perhaps life's central existential question If you had the opportunity to relive your life making the same mistakes and suffering the same consequences would you do it? Remember in making your decision that your children's lives and the loves and friendships you have experienced in your lifetime are contingent upon your answer.When you watch Peggy Sue notice how the film parallels The Wizard of Oz. Like Dorothy Peggy Sue goes 'over the rainbow' into a magical world. It is in fact the world of her own past but everything has been enchanted and transformed by her adult pointofview. The Wizard himself who must contrive to return Peggy Sue back home is Peggy Sue's kind old grandfather with his wonderful bogus lodge magic. Her friends at the reunion have their counterparts in the over the rainbow world of the past just as Dorothy's friends on the farm have their counterparts in Oz. When Peggy Sue awakens from her trip her old stale world and her old disappointing husband appear in a new light. Like Dorothy Peggy Sue awakens and learns that there is no place like home and the timeworn clich is suddenly vital and alive. Like Dorothy she is once again back in Kansas but it is a Kansas in which the characters and she herself have assumed new depths of meaning. She is now ready to step into her fateher new enriched life and there are also nuances of It's a Wonderful Life in the film.One last comment nowadays I cannot watch this comedy without tears in my eyes through pretty much the whole movie and much of this effect is due to the masterful performance of Kathleen Turner as Peggy Sue. Turner is usually on the hysterical edge of breaking down and her proximity to the precipice is a knot in my gut through the whole movie. It is a shame that she did not win the Best Actress award for this performance.".

	schema:reviewBody "What a great movie! Originally intended for Debra Winger but Kathleen Turner is wonderful as the title character Peggy Sue. It's a timetravel movie about a 42 year old woman who gets transported back in time to high school circa early 1960's. Who wouldn't love an opportunity like that not to mention being 18 again?? My favorite scene is when she walks back into her house  sees her mom young again while that beautiful music plays on the soundtrack. It's so touching  heartfelt. This movie has it all. Great acting comedy drama fantasy  a good story. Nicholas Cage can get annoying at times but he felt this was the best way to portray his character Charlie. He gets to sing in this movie too He Don't Love You. Look for a very early performance by Jim Carrey. The cast also includes Helen Hunt  Catherine Hicks the mom on the TV show 7th Heaven.".

	schema:reviewBody "This has to be the only female lead time travel movie in history. Men and boys have dominated this premise since H.G Wells but Kathleen Turner takes it back following the success of 1985's Back to the Future. Turner looks like a hot mom and then a hot high school senior. How is that possible? Casting and probably some fairly rigorous exercising. Nick Cage really is a youngster who looks more 18 than 40. But the story is all about Peggy Sue and the strange situation she finds herself in as she relives her 1960 senior year and gets the benefit of perfect hindsight. I think all will agree that the scenes with Peggy Sue's grandparents who are of course long dead to the 40 year old Peggy Sue are very touching. It's inconceivable that a film marketed for a teen audience would include these scenes. Just the mention of grandparents to a 15 year old is enough to get them heading the other direction. But even when I watched this as a 15 year old I was moved. Only an adult would truly appreciate the wisdom of their elders. But by the time we are adults our grandparents are gone. It's as true as the sky is blue. But Peggy Sue gets to take advantage of her time travel and seeks her grandparents out. The brilliance of the writing is apparent as the grandparents end up playing an important role in the plot and general moral of the story. Imagine that! There are a few gimmicks in the script such as the Beatles song and Hemingway references and the Edsel car but these are minor. The bulk of the story is firmly planted in Peggy Sue's ability to change her 17 year old decisions based on 25 years of disappointments.So she isn't actually going back in time occupying the same space as her 18 year old self as actually RELIVING the past with the memories of her adult self. There is a big difference. She's got the experiences of a 43 year old woman but is now in the body of her 18 year old self.But Francis Ford Coppola gets the credit for absolutely brilliant directing. From the opening mirror shot to the closing mirror shot his framing and editing choices are superlative. They are miles apart from what most directors were doing in 1986. This guy is a genius with the camera. There are so many cinematic references in here I can't begin to name them all. Charlie's spooky shadow a'la Lon Chaney as he sneaks up to Peggy Sue's bedroom is one that stands out. And check out the shadows in the Physics Lab. That's no accident. Make no mistake about this movie it is a real work of art. The premise is not as serious as Apocalypse Now but the execution is just as direct and effortless. That's what strikes me about this movie every time I watch it Much effort went into the execution of these scenes even though the scenes themselves don't merit much effort. We're talking about kids at a party singing Doo Wop songs. Why go through the bother of blocking and multiple takes and multiple angles? This is marketed for children and Coppola is spending production dollars. But I'll be darned if Turner didn't get nominated for an Oscar for this role. Give Coppola the credit for not making a disposable movie.The score is employed well and the attention to details pays off on an emotional level. Turner isn't weak because she ultimately can't go through with her radical changes she basically surrenders to a destiny that she can't escape from. Her children will only exist through her decision to stay with Charlie. Her surrender is what ultimately sets her free. But did she actually relive her life? Or was it a dream? You can speculate either way. The important thing is the lessons she learned from her experience. It can be summed up in one word Strudel. This is one of the few movies that is guaranteed to make me cry.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the 1986 film Peggy Sue Got Married a question is asked during the 25year class reunion and Peggy Sue answers If I knew what I know now I'd do it a lot differently. So she faints her heart stops and she wakes up in 1960 with a chance to do it all over again. Would she still get pregnant at 18 and marry Charlie who grows up to be a cheating husband bringing her much misery?She seems to try hard to do it differently. She spends lots of time with Richard the high school geek helping him understand the types of things that will come  man on the moon by 1969 pantyhose small computers large radios! She asks Is time travel possible? He says Time is like a burrito folds over on itself. She laughs when her father brings home a new Edsel. Richard says Change your destiny marry me. No she says Peggy Sue got married and that's it. Thus the title of the film.Later when Peggy Sue wakes up in 1985 again in the hospital we must ask ourselves was this just a dream? No it wasn't because Charlie shows her a book classmate Michael had given her a book he wrote that he dedicated to her based on a one magical night they had together which had not happened the first time through. During the dream she had suggested he write a book based on that night.Thus the movie answers at least for Peggy Sue the question of doing it all over again. In the end she still did the same thing but the future somehow looked brighter for her and Charlie. The right conclusion I think because it has become wellestablished that nature is more important than nurture in forming our adult tendencies.It was fun seeing all the fine actors most before their prime. Of course Kathleen Turner Peggy Sue was already established at age 32 with hits like Body Heat 81 Romancing The Stone 84 and Prizzi's Honor 85 on her resume'. Nick Cage real name Nick Coppola who plays Charlie was 22 and in his 9th film but the first with a featured role. Jim Carrey was only 24 still 8 years before he was noticed with Ace Ventura Mask and DumbDumber films all in 1994. Joan Allen was an old 30 playing a high schooler in her first theatrical film and 9 years before her defining role in Nixon as Pat. Helen Hunt Peggy Sue's daughter was 23 and already in her 28th film 3 years after Quarterback Princess but 6 years before the hit TV series Mad About You. And then there was Sofia Coppola 15 who played Peggy Sue's little sister in her 7th film. Had she either been attractive or a good actress she might not have become a director Virgin Suicides Lost In Translation.I was a teenager in the 60s and this film for me is nostalgic especially hearing all the original songs from that time. My only complaint about the movie is Nick Cage's voice. Something about it at age 22 made it very irritating to listen to. Now that he has grown up I find his voice much more pleasant. Had he not been the director's nephew I doubt that he would have gotten the role of Charlie. Overall I rate this one 8 of 10. I like it a lot.".

It had a lot of charm to it and romance comedy and timetravel seem to be a good mixture.Also it had an intriguing premise and made us think about it. If you could go back in time knowing what you know now would you do it and what would you do? I'm not talking short periods like in Groundhog Day which was done seven years after this film but if you could do it ALL over from a certain point like high school. Anyway it's fun to think about.Nicholas Cage and Kathleen Turner were fun to watch. If you view this film today be prepared to be shocked how young Cage  and Jim Carrey  look in here. Turner isn't so shocking only because today we don't see her in films regularly as we do those two guys. In fact Turner was a big star in the '80s and most people remember her looks from that period beginning with Body Heat 1981. She is the star of this film too.When I last watched this in the late 1990s I found it wasn't as good as I remembered but it still has a lot of charm and sentiment to it. It's nothing super but it is morethandecent entertainment. It helps to be fascinated by time travel which I am.I had forgotten this was a Francis Ford Cappoladirected film which is a bit of a shock because most of us associate him with The Godfather films and Apocalypse Now not some fantasyromancecomedy. However it comes together a little more when you realize Cage was his son. Cappola also finds a small role in here for his young daughter Sophia.If you are a film buff you'll be shocked at all the familiar faces in this movie from veteran actors like John Carradine to a young Helen Hunt. Check out the names in this cast! If you haven't seen this film you owe it to yourself. I'm not saying it's terrific but it's definitely worth your while not just for the actors but the thoughtprovoking subject matter.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you have seen Back to the Future 1985 you may think this Francis Ford Coppola film is a bit of a knockoff at least that's what I thought. But then I watched it. The beginning is fairly normal Peggy Sue Kathleen Turner goes to her high school reunion and is complemented by her peers even though she feels her life is a wreck because of her cheating husband. She wishes she could go back and do things differently and when she wins the title of class queen she faints and wakes up in 1960.She soon realizes she actually does have the chance to make some changes in her life and starts out trying to break up with her boyfriend whom she will marry in the future Charlie Bodell played by Nicolas Cage. But she keeps falling for him even though she experiments with going out with the town poet treats the class nerd better and asks for his help in getting back to her time and tries to develop a better relationship with her sister.In the end she gets back to her time to realize not much has changed and she ended up marrying Charlie. But now she realizes she can't go back and merely fix her past problems she needs to work them out with herself and her family.The entire film is very entertaining and feels a bit like Back to the Future only less flashy and more serious. I enjoyed all of it but a part near the end involving Peggy Sue's grandfather and his lodge friends sending her to 1986 is very strange and a bit out of place. All of the actors do a great job with their roles Kathleen Turner received an Oscar nomination but I think Nicolas Cage does the best job. It's hard to tell if his character is genuinely in love with Peggy Sue or if it is just a teenage infatuation but in the end he tells her how much he wants them to work things out. Some people may find his voice strange and annoying but I found it at times funny and sad and it made his character seem just like the adolescent he is. He gives a truly Oscar worthy performance.Overall Peggy Sue Got married is an excellent drama with some great comedic moments. Francis Ford Coppola deserves credit for taking a story that could have been a ripoff of Back to the Future and turns it into a great story about love and life. I highly recommend this film and hope it becomes a bit more well known.".

But she keeps falling for him even though she experiments with going out with the town poet treats the class nerd better and asks for his help in getting back to her time and tries to develop a better relationship with her sister.In the end she gets back to her time to realize not much has changed and she ended up marrying Charlie. But now she realizes she can't go back and merely fix her past problems she needs to work them out with herself and her family.The entire film is very entertaining and feels a bit like Back to the Future only less flashy and more serious. I enjoyed all of it but a part near the end involving Peggy Sue's grandfather and his lodge friends sending her to 1986 is very strange and a bit out of place. All of the actors do a great job with their roles Kathleen Turner received an Oscar nomination but I think Nicolas Cage does the best job. It's hard to tell if his character is genuinely in love with Peggy Sue or if it is just a teenage infatuation but in the end he tells her how much he wants them to work things out. Some people may find his voice strange and annoying but I found it at times funny and sad and it made his character seem just like the adolescent he is. He gives a truly Oscar worthy performance.Overall Peggy Sue Got married is an excellent drama with some great comedic moments. Francis Ford Coppola deserves credit for taking a story that could have been a ripoff of Back to the Future and turns it into a great story about love and life. I highly recommend this film and hope it becomes a bit more well known.";

	schema:reviewBody "Kathleen Turner has never been better than she was in those 1986 film. A much more touching time travel film than Back to the Future  Turner's character an unhappy middleaged woman has the chance to relive her high school days and do things differently only to end up making the same mistakes she made before. Turner is a gifted comedienne who has the ability to convey the pathos underneath the comedic layer.Nicholas Cage is grating at first but the character grows on you after awhile. A then unknown Jim Carrey has a small role as does Joan Allen.Francis Coppola may have just been a directorforhire on this film but he is never an uninteresting director. Look closely he adds many small touches to the film. I especially liked a scene where Barbara Harris as Peggy Sue's mother is having her jewelry appraised when Peggy Sue walks into the house. Mom lies to Peggy Sue and tells her the man is taking an election poll then tells Peggy Sue she will vote Democratic in 1960. The scene is never explained any further but it is interesting to note that 1960 was the very beginning of the women's movement. Perhaps Mrs. Kelcher is beginning to see that there is a life outside of being a housewife and mother. She wants to but is afraid to assert her independence. Hence the jewelry appraiser. Since Mrs. Kelcher has no skills outside of the house it is comforting for her to know that should it come to it she would be able to support herself temporarily by selling her jewelry. Her nest egg so to speak should she decide to leave the nest.".

	schema:reviewBody "I wondered why I didn't like Peggy Sue Got Married more than I did when it first came out in 1986 with all the hype. Somehow I found Nic Cage's character offputting. Way offputting. Then the plot didn't seem to make sense. Then by the end of the credits the question came to mind What point was this movie making? What was it saying? The answer unfortunately was not much if anything. I really don't think this movie aimed at making a statement unless it was your life is your life you're gonna make the same mistakes no matter what so keep your eye upon the doughnut and not the hole. Not a very profound statement and I'm sorry not profoundly made in this movie. The writing simply isn't that good. The direction is uneven and is strangely overblown at times. Kathleen Turner was the best and in my opinion only worthwhile thing in this movie and performed something of a miracle creating a whole character despite bizarre unexplained circumstances with a script that had no apparent statement to make. She also finally cleared up the mystery for me of the main reason I didn't enjoy this movie more. She states in her autobiography that Cage made a point of fighting his uncle Coppola's direction every step of the way doing it his own way not a good idea for a new actor and putting on a goofy voice she called stupid. His voice was annoying abrasive and unnatural and his character was obnoxious and overbearing as a young guy. I understand what he was attempting to do play a youngguy hot shot who is not as hot as he thinks he is setting up his own karma for future failure. But he goes overboard the way he does it is abrasive not effective and if he had listened to his uncle instead of fighting the Man we would have had a more enjoyable film. Cage slips a little with his obnoxious voice stylings in the movie and occasionally sounds like a real person and those scenes are more watchable than others. But if I had to watch the movie through in its entirety I would find myself wanting to pay someone in L.A. to pour a bucket of water over his head during some of his more affected puton scenes. The movie doesn't aim for a statement doesn't make a point is great to look at except when Cage is doing a demented Elvis impression but without the voice and is ultimately confusing and a waste of time. Given all this Kathleen Turner surely deserved an Oscar in this flailing mess of a movie. I can't recommend anyone spending two hours watching this unless you like Turner and have a remote to pick out all her scenes. Believe me you will miss nothing plotwise by skipping the other scenes and it will make just as much sense. Kathleen Turner is getting a lot of flak from critics regarding her Cage comments which proves that she's strong enough to be honest and to hell with other people's comments. You go Turner! I'm not particularly a fan of this actress any more than I am of any other firstrate actor or actress but her candor is refreshing. Cage's acting can be good to annoying and here it doesn't work. At least in this film now we know why.".

Buddy Holly an early Rock and Roll teen idol wrote and performed the title song Peggy Sue back in 1960. A fun nostalgic film. Turner's character has that bit of mature woman's lite cynicism which keeps this film from getting sentimental EXCEPT where she is comforted by her grandparents. There she doesn't act as a teen but is the middle aged woman asking her long dead but still loved grandparents for advice! A kind of women's Back to the Future but with no DeLorean needed.".

It really moves you and you'll never forget where you first heard the songs. The main theme is Peggy Sue's Homecoming or is it Somewhere in Time by John Barry its one or the other for sure . I wish that Hollywood would bring out more shows like this...some romance nostalgia no real violence no swearing AND yet it was a hit! Wonderful! I must admit that I'm a nostalgia fan and movies like this one all the back to the future shows have me fascinated. Perhaps it's because we often find ourselves daydreaming of the good old days and simpler times...far removed from the hectic pace of today. Heck I even love watching reruns of the Waltons! I would highly recommend this movie to everyone...cozy up to your TV with a good friend make some popcorn put a fire on and ENJOY! How could anyone NOT love this movie!".

However have you noticed how teenagers in high school through the years look younger and younger?  My mom's high school yearbook appears to be filled with 30 year olds.  Another reason I love the movie is that it makes my brain ponder on what I would do if I could go back to high school.  Peggy revisiting her young mother seeing her baby sister and being able to see her grandparents again one last time is just a beautiful thing in itself.  I guess I just like reminiscing about my childhood which is probably why I like this movie.  Even though I'm a child of the 80's.  Very few things bother me in this movie.  And no it's not Nicolas Cage's accent!  That didn't bother me that much.    It was the fact that Peggy's son Scott is not seen in the movie but is mentioned several times by Peggy and a character for Scott Bodell is in the credits at the end of the movie.  Also at the reunion Rosalee the girl in the wheelchair responsible for inviting people to the reunion and close friend of Peggy's is also not seen in the time travel back scenes.  I wish the DVD had some deleted scenes that may explain these disappearances.  But to end this review on a good note the soundtrack was superb as well!  The music is just beautiful and is one of my favorite movie scores to date.  Way to go John Barry!  I recommend this to anyone who thinks about going to a high school reunion or wishes they could go back in time to do some things differently.".

To make up for his lack of experience he gives his character a gratingly irritating voice that takes the viewers attention away from the performance.  He has a decent singing voice though.  I also agree that the scene where her grandfather and his cronies try to send her back to the future with a bizarre incantation is unnecessary and way too far fetched even considering the subject matter we're dealing with here. Still it's a fun and interestingly different take on the usual comedy and definetly worth seeing at least once.  It has some great oneliners in there...No More Jello For Me Mom was really great.".

	onyx:emotionText "Peggy Sue Got Married is a time travel movie you wish you could actually do.  Who wouldn't want to go back to high school and change at least something.  This movie has so many scenes that touch your heart such as Peggy seeing her old room again after 25 years. Visiting her grandparents who she hasn't see for a long time! Seeing her children in her Locket and knowing Charlie is worth it and that she really does love him!   Kathleen Turner is outstanding in this movie!  She really does make you believe she is a teenager and an adult at the same time! Turner and the rest of the great cast really do make this movie one of the best movies of all time. After watching it you'll really start to think If I knew then what I know now I would do a lot of things differently!";

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film for the first time two or three years ago and was decidedly underwhelmed. However as with The Dark Crystal and The Lady Vanishes I adored it on the second viewing. Kathleen Turner is excellent in the title role playing the world weary 43yearold Peggy Sue who finds herself in the body of her 17yearold self to perfection. Nicolas Cage the nephew of the director Francis Ford Coppola is every bit her equal as her future husband Charlie. This is a very successful example of nepotism something for which the Coppola family is well known. In recent years he's become almost a parody of himself and has starred in some awful films but this is one of his best ones.The film has a very strong supporting cast with the exception of Sofia Coppola a less successful example of nepotism. What's really interesting about it is that it features three actors Cage Jim Carrey and Joan Allen near the beginning of their careers who went on to bigger things in major or supporting roles and lovely cameos from three elderly actors Leon Ames in his final film Maureen O'Sullivan and John Carradine at or near the end of theirs. Coincidentally I've seen the latter three in films from the 1930s andor 1940s in the last few weeks so it's fascinating to see them in later life.The premise of the film is relatively simple but it's extraordinarily effective extremely relatable and timeless. We all wonder what it would be like to live our lives over again knowing what we do now and we all wish that we could see dead parents grandparents etc. so we can tell them how much we love them and miss them. I'd give anything to see my grandparents again.".

One that is a rookie bythebook civil officer compared to the other who's a rogue streetsmart cop who does anything to get the job done. This wouldn't have been the first time these guys shared the screen as Edwards and Whitaker had worked with each other in the classic 1982 teen comedy Fast times in Ridgemont High. The plot follows that of a idealistic young rookie cop Kearny of a rich peaceful suburb taking a transfer to downtown Diamond street the most brutal and crimeridden district. When his expolice partner is brutally murdered in the area he goes about trying to get those responsible but he will need the help of a detective Curren who knows how to get around this neighbourhood. Director Richard Benjamin provides many chaotic situations clichd but amusing and surprisingly brutal at times with its war zone like feel etched out from its urban settings. The bad guys here really do earn their strips. David Clennon is perfectly smug and showy as a rich important community figure and Joe Pantoliano is effective as the ruthlessly psychotic hired killer who goes out in a very memorable manner. But where the amusement arises is the constant clashes between Edwards and Whitaker. Also showing up is Penelope Ann Millar Ricky Aiello Art Evans and Roger Aaron Brown. Generic but still a fine addition to the fold.See I have this problem with authority.".

	schema:reviewBody "Downtown is a box office crash  burn from 1990. Basically it is yet another unsuccessful attempt to followup on the success of Beverly Hills Cop without the benefit of Eddie Murphy. These interracial buddy picture cop movie comedyaction features simply don't work without a talented comic and Anthony Edwards of Revenge of the Nerds fame is only mildly funny. Add to this a more serious group of themes than Murphy had to deal with and the incongruity of mixing these conflicting genres makes the whole a lot less than the sum of its parts. Yet Downtown is more entertaining than its bomb at the box office reputation would lead you to believe. The production design filming and editing are first class. Although the action scenes are unconvincing this is due more to lamely inserted comedy elements than cheap staging. Much is genuinely embarrassing such as when a PCP abuser holds a little girl hostage with a gun to her head and the subtext lamely plays the scene for laughs. What genius thought that scene would work? And they wonder why these things lose money? In this exercise in schizoid filmmaking Anthony Edwards and Forest Whitaker are the standard odd couple partnering up to solve the murder of Edwards' former partner. Nerd boy Alex Edwards in his worst scenes listens to Beach Boys music and in his best scenes is paired with his girlfriend Penelope Ann Miller. Alex is a suburban patrolman who has been banished to the worst downtown Philly division because of a confrontation with a slimy bigwig unconvincingly overplayed by David Clennon. Dennis Whitaker is a detective with a lot of baggage that makes it difficult for him to warm up to Alex.But Alex and Dennis eventually bond big surprise and Whitaker turns in a pretty good performance much too good for this material. Whitaker and Miller assist the marginally talented but generally likable Edwards enough that it is possible for the average viewer to suspend disbelief most of the time and actually get into the story. Just be prepared for a lot of extremely lame moments that would have been more entertaining had the editor relegated them to his deleted scenes bin. Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having owned the Delicate Sound album for several years I've found it's always one you return to for the Momentary Lapse of Reason tracks most of which weren't played live again on the Division Bell tour. Although I'm a fan of Roger Waters era Pink Floyd and his solo work being 25 my introduction to Floyd was through the David Gilmour led last days of the band and I still count Momentary Lapse Delicate Sound Division Bell and Pulse among my favourite records.This video should certainly be rereleased properly on DVD it's currently only available on DVD in a very pricey and hard to find box set also including the CD's perhaps remastered with some new extra features. Actually as I've just spent 30 on an 18 year old VHS tape EMI will probably release it next week!Obviously the main reason people will be interested in this title is for the tracks you can't get on video anywhere else On The Turning Away Dogs of War etc. but as with Pulse there are a few differences between the album and video tracklistings. The biggest disappointment is that Yet Another Movie and Round and Around are left off but instead you get Signs of Life and One Slip. Shine On is actually only the intro of the song rather then even the shortened Concert Version on Pulse but then it is a track Floyd played a lot and you can get it live anywhere apparently Echoes was also occasionally used as the opener instead on this tour which would have made a much more interesting inclusion. Money is also absent but considering it's on the Pulse video as well as Waters' live In The Flesh DVD that's no great loss and the less overplayed On The Run replaces it anyway.The style of the concert film in an American arena rather than Earl's Court is very different to Pulse too directed as it is by Wayne Isham anyone familiar with his flashy live DVD's for Metallica and Def Leppard will be familiar with the director's style which is often more like watching a music video some sounds and images intentionally don't match up although that's not as bad as it sounds than a live show. But at this point in their career Floyd seemed to be trying to get back to Meddle era anonymity after The Wall tour so that's probably exactly what they were going for. There's no friendly talking to the audience like in the Pulse video the band are backed by a massive cast of additional musicians including a spectacularly mulleted saxophonist and there's much more emphasis on the light show and some inspired Storm Thorgerson images on the video screen. It's also cool to see Gilmour Rick Wright and Nick Mason looking so much younger. Also look out for the brilliant pss take credit the band give an R. Waters for Original Pig Concept at the end!Considering there is now a visual record of every other era of Pink Floyd the '60's Syd Barrett days with the Live in London DVD the experimental Meddle era with Live in Pompeii the Waters years with The Wall film and Gilmour's version of the band with this and Pulse it would be truly great if somebody could unearth some concert footage from the band's truly greatest and democratic years between Dark Side of the Moon in '73 and Animals in '77 when Waters and Gilmour worked so brilliantly together and even let the other two write the occasional song. Numerous sources have said over the years that at least audio recordings probably exist from that time so how about a massive officially released CDDVD live box of stuff from the golden age?".

I had seats WAAAY back in the stands and although they would be considered bad seats at any other concert those seats are the only place to see a Floyd concert from. One of the things I really appreciate Pink Floyd for is the fact that they know if they give a concert there are going to be several thousand people attending it and only a handful of them will be able to really SEE them perform  for everyone else it'll be a bunch of dollsized or smaller images doing something that looks like playing instruments. Because of this a Pink Floyd concert is a show in the true sense of the word  the lights the movies shown on the round screen the surround sound setup everything  is designed to be experienced from a distance. I enjoyed the show live and enjoyed it even more in this excellent video.One of the great things about this concert is the inclusion of outside musicians. Pink Floyd does amazing things in the studio  lots of layering and overdubs that give their records a rich unmistakable sound and the fact that they go to the added expense and trouble of hiring other musicians and backup singers to fill the sound out instead of relying on prerecorded tapes is something I appreciate. When I go to a concert I want to hear what I heard on the record recreated live not a Gee that was close but where is the suchandsuch live version.This video is flawless  no cutaways to psychedelic footage of amoebas or such during solos no Hey look at the neat effects we can do  type transitions. The director used his multiple cameras very well employing skycams cranes and handheld cameras perfectly and editing what he ended up with beautifully. He and his crew capture the essence of a Pink Floyd show expertly employing dissolves black and white footage angles and camera movement with real care and deference to the music and the show itself. One of the hallmarks of a good concert film is not seeing the cameras or operators in the background and you'd have to look very hard in this one to spot any. This video is about the music and the show not about the style of the direction and that's how it should be.The audio is good for what it is  HiFi VHS stereo  and was great before the advent of DVD and DTS and Dolby Digital but now like everyone else I'm spoiled. I WANT THIS MOVIE ON DVD! NOW!!! I have no idea what the holdup on this is. The company that owns it HAS to know that there are millions of Pink Floyd fans that would snap this up the second it's released.".

The company that owns it HAS to know that there are millions of Pink Floyd fans that would snap this up the second it's released.";

You see all the important parts but not even once is there a cameraman or even a cable in sight to disturb the experience. And the light and stageshow is as always with Pink Floyd magnificent. So too is the music. The concert was a promotiontour for the Momentary Lapse Of Reason album and about a third of the video is dedicated to numbers from that album. The rest is the good old stuff! Almost all of my favorites are there and they are performed to perfection. Compared to the PULSE video I think this is slightly better due to the perfect editing.".

Overall though it was a classic example of a concert video with great potential being ruined by poor directing and modification for MTV. However the CD of this concert is awesome!

The Olympics and Superbowl have had some good multimedia displays and that video of the building in Germany I think when they used a projector to make some 3D images the Tupac hologram and some of the videos of Christmas lights are cool but this was 2 hours of that stuff combined with the clearest 3D surround sound music you've ever heard at a live event! Tickets were 25 when most tickets were 15 but it was well worth it! The concert is on YouTube and if you haven't seen it check out One of These Days or Run Like Hell if you want to see why a light show is called a light show! I have no idea how promoters are getting people to pay 450 for floor seats now! 25 back then was 2 tanks of gas and now 2 tanks of gas is 100 and if a band isn't giving a multimedia presentation equal to this for 100 you're being financially raped! I bought like 8 copies of this on VHS back in the day. I had to replace them because the VCR ate them or because friends borrowedstole them or because I played them so much they wore out. The CD doesn't have One Slip but the DVD doesn't have Money! Can you imagine releasing a Pink Floyd video and cutting out Money?".

The numbers from 'A Momentary Lapse Of Reason' are leaden and laden with morose sentimentality and Floyd's heightened obsession with making the maximum possible impact meant the loss of subtlety and surprise a bugbear of symphonic rock at the best of times the songs like the ecstatic crowd just thunder on indelicately somewhere in the background. The mechanical 'Learning To Fly' is a clumsily overproduced tune trying to sound spacey. And what is the point of a song like 'The Dogs Of War'? The musically superior 'Us and Them' also featured here had already made the same point some fifteen years earlier in a much more poetically succinct manner. Even the excellent 'One Of These Days' is messed up it certainly packs a punch but there's a dreadfully peppy stylised 80's sound to it and that's the problem with the whole album. Rock groups ever fearful of being labelled as pass sometimes do the silliest things when pandering to the fickle tastes of the zeitgeist. By that time Prozac Floyd had descended to the visual dork level of a Howard Jones with the session men sporting ridiculous mullets and straining out jazzed up sax and guitar versions of the tunes which made Floyd great accompanied by David Gilmour's silly and irksome growling. The point of this album? Another buck in the billfold.".

The backup singers were pretty hot!  Pink Floyd here is really Pink Floyd version 3. Roger Waters sued Nick Mason David Gilmour guitar god and Rick Wright over the use of the name Pink Floyd but the three remaining band members won the legal use of the name Pink Floyd but have to credit Waters where credit is due and pay him royalties I think.  Anyway either the sound editing is horrible or their singing wasn't up to snuff on that day because it sounds really muffled and along with the way the film was edited I would not recommend this film unless you are a die hard Floydhead.".

But what annoyed me is the use of three female background vocalists. They literally spoiled the show... completely destroying the psychedelic effect which was the trademark of the band.Ultimately the heart and soul of the show became Gilmour's guitars. Brilliant... in one word. The best of the songs performed must be Money as it appeared to me a bit different from the original one in tunes. Wayne Isham directed the show quite well... though not as in the level of Metallica's S  M. But in all this show is a mustsee for all Floyd fans.".

Four girlfriends get together for a hiking trip in the Canadian mountains and run across two sadistic redneck killers intent on ruining their day. But these women don't go down without a fight. I'm a horror buff and would be remiss not to admit this movie has some clichs and does follow the format of films like Wrong Turn and the like. However you do learn to love these women quickly and especially feel the bond between Rose Esther Maa and Sarah Lili Schackert. It takes 40 minutes for the gore to begin but that time is used wisely for character development. Once the action starts it doesn't stop and there are truly gory and sadistic moments worthy of the genre. The scenery is beautiful and the actresses gave stellar performances particularly Maaand the film was over before I knew it. And I was pleased with the outcome without it being cheesy or entirely predictable. So on a boring rainy day give this little film a try. I don't think you'll be disappointed.

At just over 80 minutes Break doesn't outstay it's welcome  has a fair pace with the first forty minutes scene setting  buildup with the second forty minutes none stop sadism gore death abuse  lots of chasing.

I appreciated that the final chase was actually a car pursuit rather than on foot a car chase in a film such as this is unusual. The script takes itself very seriously  tries to disturb with severed limbs girls raped beaten  tortured  while the kills aren't as gory or over the top as some films they remain reasonably effective.Apparently called Break  No Mercy Just Pain! in it's native Germany it's surprising the lengths it goes to try  convince that it's set in the US despite being shot in Germany with a German cast  crew. Character's are seen reading USA Today the cars featured are deliberately US makes  one guy even says he's visiting from Germany. Why not just set the film in Germany? Like it would make any significant difference. Another strange aspect about Break is that all the dialogue spoken is in English but the actor's used are clearly German it sounds like Germans trying to speak English written by a German in American accents  it gives Break a certain surreal vibe that I did quite like actually. There's some good gore here a few body parts are hacked up lots of blood splatter  rippedout intestines are seen a pair of severed feet are shown there's a cool slit throat at the start where the camera is placed sideways to the actress  the blood spray covers the lens people are shot a guy has a shovel embedded in his head  someone is shot with arrows. Break is pretty bloody actually although maybe not quite as graphic as some.With a supposed budget of about 300000 Break looks nice enough the scenery is very green as you would expect from a film set mainly in a forest apparently filmed in Oberammergau in Bavaria in Germany despite being set entirely in the US. The acting is pretty good to be fair the two main leads do a fine job  the main psycho manages to to creepy  just plain freaky. The only negative is the black girl Buabeng who is truly awful  I was really really happy to see her character die.Break isn't an original film it's virtually a scene for scene remake of Wrong Turn but it's decent enough for what it is  it has a certain sadism  grim nastiness that I liked. It's well made too despite the awkwardly written dialogue the strange title Break either refers to Sarah's relationship breakup or the fact that the girls are on a short break away from the city or it could mean both.

	schema:reviewBody "A young man comes back from wandering to his home town on the Danube in Romania. We don't know how long he's been gone or much about what he's been doing. When people ask him intrusive questions he just stares at them. He looks very ragged like he hasn't had a shave or a haircut in three months.He finds out when he briefly visits mum that he's got a halfsister called Fauna. He decides he wants to live out in the marshes of the delta and Fauna runs off with him in an incestuous fever. Some of you may have heard of the phenomenon referred to as Genetic Sexual Attraction. This is when siblings live apart until they meet at adulthood at which point they feel an overwhelming sexual attraction for one another. So just in case anyone would feel the incestuous side of the story is unrealistic I promise you it isn't.Mihail and Fauna live in a shack in the delta building a house on stilts in the middle of the lake during the daytime. This is presumably so they can get away from the copious amphibians and the toad chorus that is their bedtime accompaniment. The toads actually may well represent the townspeople.It's a pretty minimalistic and slow film the credits include a thanks to Bla Tarr and gnes Hranitzky with marvellous cinematography. Cinematographer Mtys Erdly is into his abstract patterns and we see some great shots for example of timber stacks and swirling inky black water. There's also a panning shot of the delta that would make a Dutch genre painter salivate and a funeral scene that would stir the bones of Tarkovsky. There are moments to sigh and gasp at the cinematography.It's obvious all along that things aren't going to end well.

	onyx:emotionText "A young man comes back from wandering to his home town on the Danube in Romania. We don't know how long he's been gone or much about what he's been doing. When people ask him intrusive questions he just stares at them. He looks very ragged like he hasn't had a shave or a haircut in three months.He finds out when he briefly visits mum that he's got a halfsister called Fauna. He decides he wants to live out in the marshes of the delta and Fauna runs off with him in an incestuous fever. Some of you may have heard of the phenomenon referred to as Genetic Sexual Attraction. This is when siblings live apart until they meet at adulthood at which point they feel an overwhelming sexual attraction for one another. So just in case anyone would feel the incestuous side of the story is unrealistic I promise you it isn't.Mihail and Fauna live in a shack in the delta building a house on stilts in the middle of the lake during the daytime. This is presumably so they can get away from the copious amphibians and the toad chorus that is their bedtime accompaniment. The toads actually may well represent the townspeople.It's a pretty minimalistic and slow film the credits include a thanks to Bla Tarr and gnes Hranitzky with marvellous cinematography. Cinematographer Mtys Erdly is into his abstract patterns and we see some great shots for example of timber stacks and swirling inky black water. There's also a panning shot of the delta that would make a Dutch genre painter salivate and a funeral scene that would stir the bones of Tarkovsky. There are moments to sigh and gasp at the cinematography.It's obvious all along that things aren't going to end well. Fauna's stepfather is jealous and the local scum have decided that Fauna and Mihail are setting themselves up above everyone else. What is beautiful tear it down.The film reminds me of an aphorism I heard once heard there are two peasants the first of whom has a cow.

The villagers consider Mihail an outsider and are opposed to the idea of a half brother and sister living alone together.

The film looks so good that every scene is a virtual painting but the storyline is a little weak with underdeveloped characters weak dialog and a plodding pace. This perhaps may have worked better as a 20 minute short film but stretched out into a feature with little background on the characters and village life weakens it.

Their affiliation toward each other  and the fact that she moves to him and helps to build a riverside house  embarrasses the community making the end of the film tragic. For me the simplicity of the story alone wouldn't be a fault it makes only the task of the director heavier. With perfection in the details and brilliant acting this simplicity could have been a strength unfortunately this movie lacks these. Lili Monori the mother and partly Orsolya Tth the daughter  plays a realistic and elaborate character but the others among them most strikingly our protagonist played by Flix Lajk just doesn't really fit to the environment  their roles.The other problem is with the cut there are many scenes without any role others seem to be very long compared with their contribution to the plot. In some cases the dramaturgy is at least mysterious as well we see Fauna in the party at the end for example. Some people are starting to shaft her in the party then she leaves the safe crowd alone so that those people can kill her would anyone do that?! Or there is another key momentum the raping scene her mother is like 50 meters away and still doesn't follow from the house what's happening?! So why I gave 6 out of 10 for a movie with so many weaknesses? First of all because of the cinematography and music also by Lajk Flix and the representation of the delta landscape. For fans of Eastern Europe some scenes will surely be unforgettable like when they are tearing the bread and pour brandy onto it and there are some 34 scenes of brilliant atmosphere e.g. the first encounter of Fauna and Mihal. I believe when cut to about 70 minutes this movie could have been much better.".

Everything in this movie is pretentious from the thank you's to Bela tarr at the beginning to the photography the acting music the story  editing. When suddenly without reason you are forced to watch close ups of charismatic looking hungarian country people in their boats while the soundtrack is trying to persuade you that this is supposed to be a dramatic moment although they are only on the way to the funeral of the local alcoholic thats one thing. Putting completely unmotivated rape scenes as a shocker is a different thing for which i absolutely have no comprehension.

	onyx:emotionText "This film is a very bad example of uninspired storytelling which tries to hide behind an artfilm facade trying to shock the audience with unmotivated violence against women to cover up for it's lack of psychological depth of the characters  internal conflicts. Everything in this movie is pretentious from the thank you's to Bela tarr at the beginning to the photography the acting music the story  editing. When suddenly without reason you are forced to watch close ups of charismatic looking hungarian country people in their boats while the soundtrack is trying to persuade you that this is supposed to be a dramatic moment although they are only on the way to the funeral of the local alcoholic thats one thing. Putting completely unmotivated rape scenes as a shocker is a different thing for which i absolutely have no comprehension. This movie is trying really hard to enter a certain genre of artistic east European drama kind of films but lacks the subtlety observational skills and soul that other directors have.";

Even tho a lot of people would argue with me on that. Sure it's about a taboo but that's about it. There are endless possibilities which could have been really great if used but they nearly skipped everything. I think the whole movie is just an excuse to show pictures which are the only decent things in this whole pile of awfulness.The acting is just plain shitty. There aren't many lines so you would think that the actors have great facial expressions or mimicking abilities but no. In fact 86 of the time they suck. And that's when they don't say anything. If they say even a single word you'll start tilting your head saying That's damn unrealistic. But than again this is partly the fault of the writing. There's also no emotion in most of the dialogs.The editing is sometimes OK but most of the time illogical and just worsens the whole picture. It could have given an emotional push yet it seems the editing in here is all about putting cuts after each other.Someone please explain it to me why critics say this movie is a masterpiece. Calling this an Art isn't gonna make it better. Sorry Mundruczo but you failed. Live with it. Even tho you probably won't care about my or any other guys opinion scarifying your child.".

This beautiful and devoted handicapped woman is beaten by her husband misunderstood by her elderly mother betrayed by her sister has her bank account emptied by unknown hands almost raped by a fat man who accosts her in a bar is thought to have murdered her now missing husband and is pursued by two cops Kiefer Sutherland and Steven Weber one of whom is interested only in justice while the other seems to dislike all women and is embarrassed by their presence. The end finds her standing alone at a deserted bus stop with a hand full of cash  alone tearful but brave.Now a pop quiz. There is only one multiplechoice question. This story was written by a a man or b a woman. Not to sound sexist. One could as easily pose a scenario about a decorated military hero and trained warrior who is captured by his enemies betrayed by his organization beaten and tortured escapes to exact revenge and winds up with the woman he loves whom he thought he'd lost long ago.The direction is functional and conventional. When Fonda regains consciousness in a hospital bed we see from her point of view the faces of the anxious doctors and nurses looking down at her  that is at the camera  an echo of every scene in myriad secondrate movies in which the gurney is being hurriedly wheeled down the corridor and people wearing starched white coats and festooned with stethoscopes hover over the camera.Hart Bochner has played a number of evil people in an interesting way  some of the characters are stupid Die Hard and some are rather more than plain rude And The Sea Will Tell. His virile handsomeness has a kind of evil tint to it. It would be too easy to cast him as a hero. Nice intentionally bland performance by Steven Weber as the dumb cop  maybe the best in the film.Bridget Fonda is interesting too. Her acting range is limited but it's on full display here. What makes her an object of interest is her almost stereotypical beauty. She's like a high school prom queen. Very feminine. Of course she can't help it if she slithers around or moves her hands so gracefully. Neither can she do anything about her nose. For most of its length it's perfectly normal and attractive but at its very tip there is a bump outward that follows the natural flare of her nostrils. The tip of that nose is full of intrigue.As for the movie  Pfui.".

Wara feels comforted by his act and comes up with an idea to form Hotai Club Bandage Club. The Club asks people to post their bruising experiences on the site then the Club applies a bandage to the damaged part or the place and a digital photograph is sent back to the original poster.

This leads to two investigative journalists including gore stalwart Ian McCulloch with two holiday makers going to the Island of Matul. After meeting a shark wrestling zombie en route they arrive at Matul where things are not going well. The hospital run by Dr. Menard has turned into a morgue where daily zombie killing has become the routine. Things go from bad to worse as the zombies grow in number and various dismemberment eye gouging jugular bites etc ensue. What makes this film so good are various factors. Apart from being one of the first gore films I ever saw it has no social commentary or hidden meaning and does not try to be a comedy although some may argue with this. It is a good honest gore film. The special effects are nice and gruesome with fantastic zombie make up great zombie attacks and loads of maggots and worms. The crazy underwater battle between zombie and shark is totally original and not surprisingly has never been tried since. The infamous eye scene whilst a bit creaky still makes the viewer cringe. The acting and dubbing are dodgy but don't detract from the zombie mayhem the music is great with calypso music to greet the heroes and throbbing effects to welcome the zombies. I cannot recommend this highly enough for good old fashioned zombie related thrills. Also look out for The Beyond and City of the Living Dead in a similar vein.".

The first thing that struck me was that the budget must have been relatively high. Fulci was never a great one for narrative coherence this is probably his most conventional film and typically for the Italian films of the time this must have been pitched as a sequence of setpieces the shark battle the fiery finale and of course the infamous eyeball scene. Unfortunately for the most part these are fairly flatly directed and fall short of their potential for tension. The earlier expository scenes are especially protracted and throughout Fulci has a tendency to leave shots hanging well past their sellby date. That said the film is not completely artless and whereas it lacks suspense it does have a degree of atmosphere about it. After the political correctness of the 80's and the 'postModernist' knowingness of the 90's Zombie Flesheaters with its excessive gore and its leering nudity its risible dubbed dialog and its a complete lack of humour with its simplistic plotting and comicbook characterisation is probably most interesting if viewed from the perspective that firstly that there was ever a market for this sort of thing and secondly that people thought that films like this needed suppressing.

They are afflicted by stalking vicious flesheating stiffs relieved by voodoo and a doctor  Richard Johnson  in practicing experimentation on the dead to obtain an antidote . Meanwhile the quarter is investigating the strange events the doctor's wife Olga Karlatos  is attacked by the Zombies.Gory gruesome  pretty repellent  and ghastly cannibal feast in which the stumbling flesheating stiffs are reanimated by voodoo and can be only destroyed by fire in the brain . Unrelenting shockfeast laced with brief touches of black humor . Army of Zombies appearance roaming the countryside  village and some people besieged inside a cottage deliver the goods  enough to be interesting . Lucio Fulci's main great success is compelling directed with startling visual content and nice production by Fabrizio De Angelis  furthermore special mention to excellent makeup by the magnificent craftsman Gianetto De Rossi. This frightening movie is plenty of thrills chills bodycount executed by the eerie Zombies and photographed in pallid color with lurid images and phenomenal results . This is a classic excruciatingly Zombie film where the intriguetension suspense appears threatening and lurking in the sunny outdoors and every room and corridors from a boat  hospital  a shack  jungle and many other places . At the time considered the plus ultra of thoroughly disturbing movie is less stomachchurning by nowadays's standards yet its fundamental power to thrill remains undiminished. Agreeable performance by Tisa Farrow Mia's sister  Richard Johnson  Al Cliver and Olga Karlatos . Watch for the great highlights as when a sliver of door punctures the eyeball a Fulci's mark who repeats ad nauseum  of one unfortunate and a zombie fighting a large shark  plus the living dead walking over the bridge towards New York City . This genuinely frightening story with correct utilization of imagesshock is well photographed by Sergio Salvati on location of Santo Domingo Dominican Republic  Isla Mujeres  Mexico and Elios studios Lazio Rome . Creepie and eerie musical score by Frizzi  in Goblin style. Lucio Fulci who also made other good terror films as  From beyond  House by the cemetery and New York ripper  creates a rare Zombie thriller that manages to be both scary and skilfully made deserving its cult status . Rating Good this is one more imaginative horror pictures in which the camera stalks in sinister style . It's just one long unrelenting cannibal feast and average budget horror movie that still packs a punch for those who like to be terrorized out their wits.".

There are some solid actors and production values are quite good. But this is trash complete and utter trash.

This is simply one of those must see movies that horror fans should see as part of their experience.Eight out of 10.".

The film's US cover is a prime example of the FX's originality and authenticity.Without a doubt this is Lucio Filci's best film and it is worthy of a zombie fan's attention.  However the movie has a goodlong hour of boredom in its middle.  The only moment where I started enjoying the movie was the climax.  The last twenty minutes or so were great.

	schema:headline " Weak but not unwatchable... Fulci seems overrated...";
	schema:reviewBody "The best thing about this movie is the makeup... which is at times superior to Savini's work in any of the 'Dead' films with the exception of the 'Dawn of the Dead' remake which I thought was superb in most parts zombie baby EXCLUDED P While Savini has definitely pioneered many great techniques and while he has definitely appeared to have mastered 'the zombie bite' effect... there is make up in Zombie 2 that is simply superior to much of his work and creepier I think due to it's minimalist approach.Other than that this is possibly one of the weakest zombie movies ever made with the exception of campy 1930's zombie fare.The worst thing about this movie is the direction hands down. This is interesting considering many of the user comments hail Fulci as some underrated auteur. The believability of much of this movie's goingson relies on careful direction not only of the actors but of the narrative as well. Neither is sufficient. At times you may find yourself yelling at the characters in this movie...and becoming irritated with not only their stupidity but the obvious lack of attention to the threshold of disbelief on the part of the filmmakers. Characters in this film will freeze and literally brandish their necks in anticipation of the zombie's attack as if they are willingly offering up a free lunch much like a bad Dracula film. Shock or sheer terror is not an excuse for this behavior...its simply unbelievable that people would 'act' this way and silly.The camera work in this movie is elementary and textbookish. Fulci's overuse of the revealing pan is tedious and stunts the pace of many the more intense zombie scenes.The 'eyeball' scene is heavy handed and its far too weighty an effect in comparison to the rest of the gore throughout the film. There is nothing else in the movie that even comes close to this scene and the gore is inconsistent for this reason.My favorite scene is the later discovery of the Doctor's wife. This scene I felt was duelly creepy and believable enough to stick with me. The use of the flashlight to reveal the scene was very choice and better employed than in Romero's later 'Land of the Dead'.I cannot overstate this film's sluggish pace. Though should we expect more from a movie about the walking undead? I believe the remake of 'Dawn of the Dead'2004 mastered the sluggish zombie to rabid zombie ratio.The acting in this movie is largely a moot point for two reasons. Of course we cannot expect Shakespearean academics in a zombie film. But also we cannot expect much more from an English overdub. I recommend finding a copy of the original Italian though much of the acting is still notably bad regardless.It is a shame that such an interesting premise for a zombie movie is so poorly executed. I appreciated the voodoo magic undertones of this film but 'Woodoo' Zombie 2 hardly delivers. It might be valid to say this movie suffers from a lack of information whereas a movie like 'Day of the Dead'1985 seems to suffer from a surplus.'Night of the Living Dead'1968 the original Romero classic is still in my notsohumble opinion the quintessential zombie film. After all these years it seems to offer the best ratio of believability over sheer entertainment. Every zombie movie has its weak and strong points but I do believe Zombie 2 is one of the weakest films I've seen in this genre.I must say I sympathize with zombie enthusiasts over this film. I have yet to see a zombie movie that I felt was simply unwatchable. 'Zombie 2' is indeed an interesting installmentartifact in the zombie genre however it seems by perusing the user comments that a few of the fans of this genre are much like the zombies themselves... voraciously feeding off zombie films regardless of the craft of filmmaking. No matter zombie movies are good fun regardless and make for a chilling time no matter what. I had fun watching this movie as with any zombie flick.andy".

This is interesting considering many of the user comments hail Fulci as some underrated auteur. The believability of much of this movie's goingson relies on careful direction not only of the actors but of the narrative as well. Neither is sufficient. At times you may find yourself yelling at the characters in this movie...and becoming irritated with not only their stupidity but the obvious lack of attention to the threshold of disbelief on the part of the filmmakers.

	schema:reviewBody "A zombiemaned sailboat wanders into New York Harbor. Once the onboard 'dead' are disposed of the search begins for the boat's origin. Anne Bowles Tisa Farrow sister to Mia the daughter of its owner travels with journalist Peter West Fulci regular Ian McCulloch to Matul Island in the Antilles in search of not only her father but also answers concerning the homicidal yet trancelike behavior of those that were on the sailboat. With the help of Caribbean expatriates Brian Italian Bmovie icon Al 'hubbahubba' Ciner and his ladyfriend Susan the four of them eventually find their way to Matul  a cursed place according to all who live on neighboring islands. It turns out that Anne's father is now dead along with most of the island's inhabitants and that the remaining 'whities' a Dr. Mernard his wife Paola a nurse and a handyman are all desperately trying to hold out until a cure is found for the disease that is killing everyone and turning them into flesheating zombies. Needless to say panic ensues. Up till 1979 Italian Horror had its more than fair share of satanic witches deformed murderers luscious murderesses old vampires vengeful ghosts mad doctors deranged lunatics very bad mommies and loony priests. But where are the zombies?According to many 'zombiphiles' Italian Horror is the apocalyptic apogee when it comes to the many worlds of the walking dead. Well the subgenre pretty much started right here with Fulci's 1979 gore fest Zombie. Italian cinema had yet to fully embrace the zombie film as 1974's Let Sleeping Corpses Lie though an ItalianSpanish coproduction and chiefly made on the lira is aesthetically really a Spanish Horror film with the director writers and most of the crew and supporting cast hailing from Barcelona Spanish Horror is a whole other netherworld of wonders that flourished throughout the 1970's. So just where does Fulci's film come from? Popular consensus would have us believe that Zombie was made so as to be an unofficial sequel to the 1978 RomeroArgento cocreation Dawn of the Dead. The truth is that Zombie was written and began preproduction before Dawn of the Dead was even released in Italy. The New York City sequences that bookend Zombie were added after the producers demanded their presence  an attempt to cash in on Dawn's phenomenal success in Italy. In the end these changes make Zombie appear to be a prequel to Dawn with the film's plot trying to explain how Romero's zombies came to be. Unfortunately many people decry Zombie for this fact alone and perhaps rightfully so. But if you can get past this greedy little capitalist piece of information Fulci's Zombie contains many wonderful treasures both campy and earnest.Though Fulci had tinkered with gore effects in previous films chiefly Don't Torture a Duckling and Four of the Apocalypse it was in Zombie that it blossomed into a heaping steaming slippery pile of guts and goo. Containing what is one of the most infamous kill scenes in all of Italian Horror the eyegouging of Paola Menard via walking corpse and a really big splinter Zombie opened the floodgates to on screen viscera the influence of which is still with us to this day. And the films has its far share of scares too in particular the rising of the longdead conquistadors and the pot luck organfest after Paola's demise. Mrs. Menard is portrayed by shapely and buxom love goddess Olga Karlatos most of us know her as Prince's mom in Purple Rain. Olga delivers a truly naked performance in that not only is she nude for almost her entire time on screen but that she also acts with such utter Methodabandon. Unlike Tisa Farrow whom you could actually mistake for one of the living dead if she didn't open her mouth to speak occasionally. Hence the two campy elements to Zombie. One  the potential Ed WoodAndy Milliganlike cult that could rise out of the perpetually wooden Italian Horror performances of Tisa Farrow see also Anthropophagus. And two  Zombie is without a doubt the only film that dares to ask the allimportant question which would win the ultimate death match zombie or shark?And as for the living dead themselves these aren't Romero's or the fastpaced killers of Lenzi's abominable Nightmare City. Fulci's zombies are slow moving stilldecomposing worminfested voodoo sloths. And the voodoo is a key element here for in all likelihood Dr. Menard's sciencedriven work was in vain. These zombies are not radioactive killers or virus laden maniacs if anything Fulci owes more of a debt to Jacques Tourneur's 1943 classic I Walked With a Zombie whose living dead were the simple nightmarish personification of slavetrade revenge and anger. There was an era of nihilism hedonism and bleakness on the horizon for not just Italian Horror but for all in the Western World who would dwelled under the dark cloud of the Reagan and Thatcher Era. With Zombie Fulci not only kick started a craze of flesheating cannibalism and barf bag gore but a whole slew of films that purposefully presented only hopelessness decay oblivion and the unavoidable selfdevouring of mankind.".

One of the essential parts of a good zombie movie is a sense of impending doom and Zombi 2 completely lacks that. Maybe it's the tropical colors or maybe even the godawful score. The rating on here is a 6 and that's appropriate. It's middle of the road zombie fare that won't win any fans to the genre.

	schema:reviewBody "I'm really beginning to wonder why Lucio Fulci is regarded as an aboveaverage horror director. The New York Ripper was a horrible mess of terrible acting disgusting gore and laughable dialogue. Zombie suffers from the same three problems but it's not quite as bad as The New York Ripper. The basic plot is this A mad scientist has created a method of raising the dead but his creation winds up out of control and out of his hands when undead zombies start showing up and eating people. The daughter of said mad scientist along with a nosy journalist travel to the island where he's been performing his experiments in the hope of finding out what happened to him. The biggest problem with Zombie is the complete lack of gore up until about an hour into the flick. While there are a few instances of violence before then  that infamous zombiefightingashark sequence is one of them  the entire midsection of the film is essentially disposable and incredibly boring. Finally towards the end we get an allout zombie attack and the flick finally becomes interesting and dare I say it exciting. But really it's just not worth the first hour that you have to sit through to get there. Having said that there are some creatively disgusting methods of dispatching victims here most notably the woman who winds up with an eyeful of broken wood. As good as that was though the horrible acting uneven pacing and truly awful dialogue negates anything positive about the movie.".

Now in the early 50s new horror movies were made of the classic monsters with more gore but tame in comparison to movies like this one.I had just done a play in New York and as a favor the director of that play got me an extra part in this movie although he didn't know it at the time. All he knew was that it paid 40 bucks and used heavy makeup. When I got to the hotel where the film crew was staying and I saw fake eyeballs artificial blood and the like I thought of backing out but then talked myself into it by saying Well Boris started this way referring to my favorite horror star Boris Karloff the original Frankenstein and later the voice of the Grinch in the animated television classic by Chuck Jones.So anyway I am only in that last scene on the Brooklyn Bridge with heavy makeup and since at the time I was so under nourished I was the perfect face for a zombie. It was drizzly rainy that day and joggers and bicyclists kept spoiling the shot so it ended up having numerous takes. These people would usually ask Are you guys making a movie? A stupid question I wanted to answer with No we were just in a terrible accident and were filming it for insurance purposes. DUH! Anyway I am quite squeamish about such movies and don't like them. I only gave it a 3 because I was IN it! I have nieces and nephews that think Uncle Johnny is cool because he played a zombie in the movies.I own a copy but never did watch it all the way through and perhaps never will. I don't get why people like to watch movies of this kind. Each to hisher own I guess.Strangely enough Signior Fulci gets a GREATEST MOVIE he ever made compliment from one of the revewers of this grisly film. And to think the lead ALMOST played James Bond before Sean Connery got the role but he DID play Bulldog Drummond in two films. His leading lady was Mia Farrow's sister.Oh yeah. And the makeup man Gianetto De Rossi seemed to be the only one of the crew who spoke English and even though I grew up hearing Sicilian spoken around me I was not fluent. The direction I got from the director Signior Fulci was Likeah dis! showing us how to walk like a zombie. And the fake blood tasted awful since it had ammonia in it so as not to change colors.And whenever one of these silly guys would jog or ride with bicycles across the bridge The director would cry Cut. Cut. Go back in his best noaccent Italian he could muster.Now if ONLY IMDb would give me the one credit I SHOULD have had that would be GREAT! D".

	schema:reviewBody "Kurt Vonnegut's satirical novel of 1973 resonates as deeply now as it did way back then. The themes of suburban paranoia and soulless consumerism have motivated some of the best films of the last twelve months so an inspired interpretation of Breakfast of Champions would have been warmly endorsed.It's clearly been a labour of love for director Alan Rudolph who has tried for twenty years to make this film. Sadly twenty years of work appears to have produced one bad draft copy. And Rudolph does not have the slightest grasp on what is funny.Nick Nolte wanders aimlessly around in a dress but it isn't funny. Albert Finney searches out his chaotic literary masterpieces in pornographic magazines but it isn't funny. Barbara Hershey's character is a product of the chaos but her appearances lack a motive. She isn't required until the film bursts into chaotic life in its last ten minutes.This means three great actors are left stranded. It results in the unlikely event of Bruce Willis stealing the acting honours. He is good but one feels it would have been no great stretch to act insane.Among the problems here is that the film keeps its feet on the ground. While we're expected to believe the world has gone mad the actual events are as uninspired as they are unfunny. This doesn't mean it is any easier to understand. In fact without having read the novel you'd most likely be lost from the beginning.The chaos of Vonnegut's vision was its real joy. The way characters conspired to come together was inventive. The film though plays like a cliche. The ending is anarchic but you get the impression it only serves one purpose to stop you making rational sense of the rest of the film. And as much as you want to like it or applaud Rudolph's commitment the truth is that BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS is a sad poor film.".

This movie is an eclectic mix of oddball characters trying to find their place in this strange thing we call life.

A great cast a director Aland Rudolph who has made several films I've enjoyed Choose Me The Moderns Trouble in Mind. Sadly BofC is quite a disappointment.Two things really stick out for me. Although Bruce Willis was quite good as Dwayne Hoover too many of the other characters notably Harry LeSabre Nick Nolte and Wayne Hoobler Omar Epps are portrayed in frenetic over the top performances. OK...we get it that there are all sorts of crazies running amuck in Midland City but the point Vonnegut was making in his novel was that this madness is displayed in the normal everyday way that we live our lives in America. The values consumerism greed violence and actions that are considered normal in the United States are themselves proof that we are all suffering from a form of madness...showing these fine actors jumping around and uttering indecipherable gibberish shows only that they are annoying.The film also has a problem in creating a consistent point of view. In the novel the author guides us through Dwayne Hoovers' unfolding madness and is actually a character in the book. The movie can't give us the background information the books' narrator did and I would guess that anyone who hasn't read the book will find the movie tough going...perhaps downright incomprehensible.Lastly as a great fan of Kilgore Trout Vonnegut fans know him as a character who pops up in several Vonnegut novels I thought Albert Finney did quite a nice job he had just the right air of unkempt curmudgeonly insane genius that makes Trout my favorite Vonnegut character of all time. Still it's hardly enough to save this mess...I admire the effort in bringing Breakfast of Champions to the screen but in the end it's likely that this is an unfilmable novel.".

Is it something you feel or is it something perceived by others?  What is a good movie?  Can a good movie stand on its own or does it have to be financially and critically acclaimed in our time?Like many martyrs in history the success of Breakfast of Champions is that it was made and that it reaches the audience it wants to however small.I watch this film and know in my heart that there is love behind every scene and that even though it seems that the work goes on its own artistic tangents the underlying unity of the film is sound and loyal.  Everything in the film is for a reason.".

Can a good movie stand on its own or does it have to be financially and critically acclaimed in our time?Like many martyrs in history the success of Breakfast of Champions is that it was made and that it reaches the audience it wants to however small.I watch this film and know in my heart that there is love behind every scene and that even though it seems that the work goes on its own artistic tangents the underlying unity of the film is sound and loyal.  Everything in the film is for a reason.";

This movie is extremely formalistic so good luck trying to figure out a coherent plot.

This one was not a good film or even a decent film. It stunk big head cheese left on a hot Texas porch in July.It wasn't for lack of trying or talent it just failed to understand the material or simply wasn't able to translate it to film and I just gotta say I don't care if BoC is Willis' favorite book he can't pull off Dwayne Hoover and his presence while being the sole reason for this adaptation's existence kills the film from his acting to his obvious control over it behind the scenes as a producer and a financier.

I can only think that Vonnegut was simply too benevolent to consider himself as having been screwed on this film he's even in it for the blink of an eye and during one of the terrible invented scenes. I hope to god that when they finally get around to making a movie of Cat's Cradle that this isn't what becomes of it.

That scene in the movie alone was worth the price of admission.  Better than the book too.The ending is better than I expected and very Vonnegutlike.  It answers an unanswerable question with an answer that has no objective meaning. Willis babbling It's just life may not be particularly deep as the police are hauling him off but I kept thinking What are they going to charge him with?  Breaking up his own bar?  Hoover owned the hotel and the bar he goes berserk in.  His son Bunny and his wife have forgiven him.  Who'll press charges?  Vonnegut?  It was just cops being Police Machines  film at 11.Vonnegut's illustrations are in the movie he's in the movie... it's a Vonnegut extravaganza!  Like Slaughterhouse 5 the book and movie are different but retain some flavor of the original.The biggest failing of this movie is that most of the visual and musical references will be lost on a younger crowd hardly their fault.  The cultural references could have been updated but then it wouldn't have been an authentic representation of the book which is a period piece.It's intentionally a flick for a niche market and it does a very good job at that.Which brings us back to if you don't like Vonnegut you'll loathe this movie.I liked it a lot.".

Barbara Hershey is utterly useless and unecessary.Though Bruce Willis delivers a very acceptable performance he is plagued by perhaps the worst writing possible.

He was about showing life as it is and showing how absurd and complicated it can be if we just stop and look around a little  how tragic and comedic and in some cases meaningless it can be.  The book especially was about adapting to chaos because order is simply a fantasy so many would like to believe in.To this end the creators of this film performed the greatest injustice by tacking on the hokiest pokiest pieinthesky ending.  The ending of the book has Vonnegut transcending his characters  throwing out all that is meaningless.  This movie says in effect well it's just life thanks for playing.Kurt Vonnegut now has a novel's worth of material on how ridiculous this movie is.Look if any of you out there read the book you will realize something. Next time you go to work or to school or anywhere you will see that there's a lot more beneath the surface of your fellow man tragedy comedy heroism and evil  all us in this world adapting to chaos in the best way we know how.  This movie on the other hand is about what happens when you throw up in a blender turn it on microwave the contents bake it for five hours and then film it.It is utter trash.  An insult to everyting Vonnegut.  Another reviewer said it right when he said that Magnolia was a much better translation of Kurt vonnegut's book.  And I thought Slaughter House Five was a failure although an ambitious failure.Gah!  I can say no more.  It's just too awful.  Even if you just buy the novel and beat yourself over the head with it you will get move Vonnegut than this film could ever hope to deliver.

Just think about how it would be like to go insaneto realize that you're on your own in a world of machinesthat you're just another brick in the wall and to freak outtry to free yourself and then see that there's no escape...just to continue...to go on being imprisonedbut only physicalyour mind was freed when you realized all of this.";

Not many of us and Kitten wants it more than most. Her journey to find love in whatever form it may take is both touching and harrowing at times. You cringe when she finds her self in certain situations and you root for her to take charge of her life but that is something she is quite unable to do for the most part of her journey.While this story features the good the bad and the ugly of the transvestite lifestyle there is no judgment being made it is presented as a simple fact of Kitten's life from nearly the first time you see her. That in itself is refreshing. There are stereotypes but not presented in stereotypical situation which is also refreshing.I came away from this movie with a warm feeling in my heart for the character the story and the commitment of everyone involved in the film it drew me in it took me to places I did not expect and it gave me a film experience you simply can not find every day in our cookie cutter Hollywood film world these days.

And interestingly in this new film Jordan returns to exactly the same intertwined themes that marked Crying Game the armed struggle of Northern Irish Catholics against the British Crown and gender bending.Unlike the last minute revelations in Crying Game however here the protagonist's transsexuality is placed front and center from the getgo. Cillian Murphy gives a bravura performance as Patrick Kitten Braden in a story set in the 60s and 70s. Murphy oozes sensual vitality and is a world class flirt but he's also genuinely kind and compassionate toward everybody.The story is divided into 35 brief fast paced chapters following Kitten's life over several years first in a village near Belfast later in London. The musical score which is extraordinarily good is an eclectic mix of everything from 40s pop tunes to Harry Nilsson and Van Morrison. Good supporting turns are provided by Liam Neeson Ruth Negga Stephen Rea Gavin Friday and Brendan Gleeson. My top rated narrative drama of 2005 grade 1010 A.".

Do not judge Mr. Murphy's acting skills from just watching Batman Begins or Red Eye this level of acting falls more in the type of his earlier works such as On the Edge and Disco Pigs Liam Neeson Stephen Rea and Brandon Gleeson are far more than excellent in supporting roles. This film is dependent on its star Mr. Murphy and he shines. The themes in this film are universal. Even while the story is sad and the situation the main character Kittenfinds herself in are very sad it somehow always becomes funny. The interaction between Kitten and the people around her is fascinating funny and truetolife. Mr. Murphy is amazing and deserves and Academy Award for his stunning and flawless portrayal of such a complicated character. It is fabulous!!! Don't want to spoil anything about the plot but if anyone has read the book DO NOT expect the same situations or ending.This film is tender sweet funny has an amazing script and has actors that made this to some farfetched not to me or anyone I know but one could have that impression fairytale like story excellent. If you strip away the complicated details of this transsexual Irish male and his travels during the 70's you can find the root universal story of a young person looking for love.".

The film was simply wonderful from beginning to endcharming emotionally satisfying delicately nuanced and very powerful. The acting was sublime as in all Jordan films.

Cillian Murphy was fabulous as the brave and relentless seeker of the truth who faced life with conviction even when everything around him seemed to be disintegrating. Liam Neeson as the town priest was credible and at times heartbreakingly genuine in his reactions to unfolding situations. Stephen Rea was an unorthodox but sweet magician who brought a great deal to his small part. The supporting cast especially Brendan Gleeson and Ruth Negga acted with realism and intensity that helped bring the film to life. Neil Jordan whose track record stands on its own delivered a delicious dim sum that left me wanting more and at the same time completely sated. Declan Quinn's dulcet cinematography much like that of Monsoon Wedding and Vanity Fair made the film one of the most lustrous at Toronto. After getting the willies watching how evil Murphy can be it was great to see him as an uberhero. Oh and did I say I want some of those outfits?".

Mr. Jordan achieves another triumph in his distinguished career with this new movie that has a genuine and gritty look thanks to the excellent cinematography by Declan Quinn.When young Patrick is left at the step of the small town's church Father Bernard doesn't seem too surprised to find the young infant at his door. He is instrumental in placing the young boy with one of the town's women who brings up Patrick until he is a teen ager. It becomes clear young Patrick is a little girl trapped in a boy's body. He begins calling himself Kitten. His love for the outrageous makes him dress in a manner that he sticks out from the crowd. As such he attracts the eye of a singer of a band who falls for Kitten and takes her to live in a remote part of the country. Alas the romance takes a tragic turn because of Billy's involvement with the IRA.Kitten always wanted to find the Phantom Lady a nickname he gave to his natural mother who moved to London after giving him up. As he arrives in the big city Kitten discovers a world he never knew and in many ways he thrives int the rich atmosphere of that swinging place at that time. The film is in a way a picaresque account of Kitten's road to maturity. His goal to find his mother doesn't happen until the end of the film.

	schema:headline " Great Film... possible spoilers";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw the film at the NY Film Festival with the actors in attendance and I have to say that I loved it. In the film Patrick Kitten Braden is an Irish baby who was abandoned by his mother on the doorstep of an uncaring stepmother. From the time he is a child Kitten's cross dressing tendencies and his outspoken nature cause people to reject him remember this is Catholic Ireland in the 70s. Kitten grows up among the unrest of the IRA but he is determined to be happy and in order to be happy he has to be himself or herself. He goes to London where he encounters all sorts of problems they don't like the fact that he's Irish or a transvestite but he keeps his optimistic nature despite all the hardship. The film is not about a person discovering himself as so many comingofage movies are it is about a Kitten knowing who she is and not changing her ways to please the world at large.The direction and cinematography are amazing but then this is Neil Jordan. Whatever problems you might have had with Interview With a Vampire you can't deny that the movie was beautiful to look at. The same is true of all Jordan's films. He starts this film with a bird's eye view and has many beautiful touches throughout. The chapter titles are hilarious. In particular look out for the beautiful shot composition and direction of the scene between Kitten and her father in the peeping club. It's absolutely beautiful and well shot. Though he strays from the book a lot I believe the movie remains true to the character of Patrick a charming sometimes selfinvolved person who stubbornly makes his way through life. It must have been difficult to bring Kitten's active fantasy life to the screen but Jordan helps us navigate between her fantasies and her reality with great skill.The performances are the best thing about the film. Liam Neeson is always great and this is no exception. Same goes for Stephen Rea. The actress who plays Charlie is someone to watch out for she's great. The guy who plays Irwin did not impress me but he wasn't bad. The movie however belongs to Cillian. Physically he is suited for the role because he's so small but it isn't just his appearance that helps. I've been watching Murphy's career since 28 Days Later and I love his ability to switch between being really intimidating Red Eye or really vulnerable How Harry Became a Tree sometimes he's both in the same movie 28 Days Later. The man knows how to use his body to convey strength or the lack thereof. Here he is absolutely convincing as the witty Kitten who desperately wants to be loved but won't compromise her personality. You can see the hurt in his eyes when he is mistreated but also the strength of his mind when he is determined to do something witness the gun disposal scene and the police interrogation scene. Just because Kitten looks weak doesn't mean he is weak. When you least expect it he summons a great amount of strength to pull through difficult situations.I highly recommend the movie to anyone who has a chance to see it. It is hilarious yet heartbreaking. The events related by Kitten are sad and terrible but Kitten's sense of humor always shines through. The audience was in stitches the whole time. Was the movie perfect? No. Is it incredibly good even great? Definitely.".

I immediately wanted to take back those words for who am I to judge someone's sexuality andor choice of apparel . . .As an infant Kitten Brady is abandoned on the doorstep of a priest. As it turns out  beside the women's clothing and all  he's pretty normal  like anyone he wants to know who his parents are and why his mom left him there. He wants to belong somewhere.On the one hand he seems to be drifting through life clinging to whomever will have him  but don't we all have that need to be wanted? But rather than searching for himself Kitten is more sure of who he is than most people  he wears who he is on the outside every day and goes through life being bashed because of it. Most of us aren't that brave.Murphy's portrayal of Kitten is flawless. He makes a beautiful woman by the way. He communicates Kitten's seamless connection with femininity by himself revealing nothing false about his own transformation into this character. We cease to see Kitten as a man or to define his gender somewhere in the first third of the film and instead see Kitten's feelings and longings  which are exactly like our own. He becomes familiar comfortable. We would not begrudge Kitten being happy ever.Kitten appears weak but he's strong enough to withstand anything in his quest for belonging.I found myself wanting to read the novel this movie is based on as the IRA terrorist portion while interesting was a bit difficult to connect to the rest of Kitten's experience.Liam Neeson is as always excellent although we don't get to know his character well before we are reintroduced  so has he changed or did we just not know him? There are some nice emotional moments and we care about Kitten but the vignettes give us more of a series of snapshots of Kitten but not much plot until the last third of the film. It left one wondering a bit if Cillian Murphy's Kitten hasn't made a sweet feast for us out of not such a filling story.Still watching this film is like eating delicious cheesecake. Each delicious bite reminds you that the last one was delicious and the next one will be delicious.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is admirable that a film of such tragic content can manage both accessible and enjoyable. In the front row for the 'tragic' part is Kitten a flamboyant highspirited transvestite who falls prey to prostitution and accusations of terrorism in Britain during the late 1960's. In the enjoyable end are the film's layered performances fluent narration and arguably its goldmine the music...The opening of 'Breakfast on Pluto' sees a lively Cillian Murphy strut down the street to Sugar Baby Love by the Rubettes with long blonde hair red lipstick and a killer dress playfully exchanging sass with onlookers and flirting with life. He is exuding courage. Cut to a bleak small Irish town on the border and a young woman leaving her baby outside the Bishop's door in a basket. The baby is Kitten and the bishop is Liam Neeson whom upon discovering this new 'gift' adopts a confused troubled expression that he wears well for the rest of the film.Where the good ol' Bishop stays the same  patient but troubled  Kitten shifts onto a path that undoubtedly deviates from the strict conventions of the Irish community he develops a fondness for crossdressing in ladies' clothes writing racy stories and expressing himself creatively. Walking around in an idealist bubble of dreams while being harshly raised as a 'bastard' child Kitten's bubble bursts eventually and he runs off seeking greener pastures in London where he ultimately resorts to fullyfledged prostitution.Although I am no member of the Cillian Murphy camp I credit where credit is due and this film is a showcase for his unique talent. I say 'unique' since realism is typically sought from actors today and Murphy embodies the opposite  he is theatrical overthetop colourful and flamboyant which is why he fits the part of a transvestite so well. His character Kitten stands up for what he believes in and when faced with injustice  such as false accusations for IRA bombings  he indulges in music writing and art descending into his own mind and never once letting the bitterness overcome him. The soundtrack to 'Pluto' is nothing short of remarkable sewing together the narrative with deft strokes. It is simply peppered with 1960's1970's gems.Yet the film's heaviest weapon in its arsenal is contrast a device that Neil Jordon clearly has wielded to perfection here. One minute it is bursting with hippie music  a sprawling surge of contemporary flair and fury that takes the form of fashion music and lifestyle. The next minute it zooms back in on the bleak little Irish town making it overtly clear to the reader why Kitten fled his native town for London in the first place. Yet there's that familiarity about it and Liam Neeson... needless to say Pluto delicately juxtaposes the life in Ireland with the life in London during this era. In the portrayal of the latter it aptly balances tragedy with comedy funny with grave bleak with colourful. It is a gripping amalgam of qualities.'Breakfast on Pluto' is devoid of any discernible flaws except that there is a multitude of characters to keep track of and it seems as though the film itself loses focus at times because of this and because of a pacing that occasionally drags. A little condensation would be nice perhaps. It also tips over into absurdity at a few points such as a maid talking to Liam Neeson's crotch not that I didn't enjoy the closeup! in one of Kitten's fantasies. it needs to be said it carefully treads between stupid and fun. But it does it extremely well.8 out of 10".

Weaving itself in and out of Kitten's life are the IRA but this seems to be more circumstantial than essential to Kitten's character because she couldn't be less interested in rifles or bombs or their plight even when the people she associates with  due to chance  are. There's an extremely funny scene when after Kitten tanks as a rock chick because the band deems her an act killer and a target for homophobes the leader of the band takes a liking to her brings her to his trailer in the middle of nowhere where once she decides to clean it up she finds a huge arsenal of rifles of all shapes and sizes and decides to dispose of them later an act that almost causes her to get killed. Later on she inexplicably winds up being a suspect in the bombing of a disco but this is less due to her transvestism and more to her Irishness.Despite a film about someone in the outer reaches of acceptance there is surprisingly little homophobia in BREAKFAST ON PLUTO. The violence Kitten finds on the streets is again circumstantial  anyone working the streets is subject to meeting the weirdest creepiest folk and Kitten seems to attract them like flies. It's actually a relief when the same policeman who at first tried to wrestle any truth to her involvement with the IRA sees how she doesn't belong in the streets and takes her to a local peep show where she finally finds some order in her chaotic life and the woman inside her comes out in full bloom. As an added irony this is exactly when she learns of her biological mother but like the boy in The Alchemist finding her mother is anticlimactic. It's been a trick throughout the entire movie. She never needed this reaffirmation of her own self  she was always there.It takes a lot of steel to play this kind of role and not many actors so dependent they are on their perception of masculinity itself a form of vanity and insecurity can pull it off so convincingly. You will never see a Tom Cruise or a Mel Gibson do this sort of character  perish the thought! Cillian Murphy so vicious in RED EYE does a complete left turn and not only becomes Kitten but disappears completely into her femininity somewhat reminiscent of Dusty Springfield who continually sings in the background her Windmills of your Mind. It's such a moving performance that far exceeds Dustin Hoffman's in TOOTSIE and even Johnny Depp's in ED WOOD because it's not a onenote joke. Kitten is a man in search of his inner woman knowing he is way out there not caring one bit to play it stealth as many transgendered do who stands up to his existence as a she and finds her own acceptance even when the world may not always embrace it.".

	schema:reviewBody "If Candide had been born a trannie Irishman from the 1960's through Thacherite England he would be Cillian Murphy in Breakfast on Pluto. Neil Jordan draws on several genres to create an original view point of politics music and human relationships  takes on the troubles from Bloody Sunday and Jim Sheridan's films the cultural changes in the period like Milos Forman's Hair and Forest Gump drag queens from The Adventures of Priscilla Queen of the Desert and The Naked Civil Servant and the genderbending combination in his own The Crying Game.But the story direction and most of all the central performance create a complete person at a specific time that has renewed contemporary relevance. Whereas Felicity Huffman's transsexual in Transamerica just wants to disappear into normalness Murphy's PatrickKitten Braden eschews the frequent importuning to be serious and wants from childhood to live his fantasies to make them real despite a world demanding eitheror with us or against us. This is the first film I can think of with no revelation of childhood sexual abuse for such a character but rather an orphan's lack of parental love from birth.Jordan marvelously pulls off the trick of seamlessly integrating for the viewer the gritty tumultuous reality with Kittens amusing talent for turning a sordid life into the best of all possible worlds as a romantic musical romantic fantasy. We see this world both from Kittens perspective complete with talking robins and sardonic autobiographical chapter headings that I presume were carried over from Pat McCabe's novel as he cowrote the script and the reactions of friends and enemies as PatrickKitten goes from the frying pan into the fire perhaps too many times amidst political cultural and violent turmoil. One of the continuing themes is no matter what worlds Kitten picaresquely glides through from a small town to Dublin to rock 'n' roll to IRA fighters to cops to nightclubs to London streets and more homophobia trumps every other hatred that any one has for any other person place thing religion or philosophy. This is adroitly illustrated when Kitten becomes enamored of a glam rock bar band led by a charismatic Gavin Friday and pushes the boundaries of that genderbending performance art too far for straight guys' comfort. Rocker Bryan Ferry also has a small but nonmusical role as one of a string of many many older men some down right creepy attracted to Kitten for good or ill in a distorted Oedipal mirror.While Kitten doesn't actually say she is dependent on the kindness of strangers it is a relief when now and again friends rescue her when she seems incapable of either common sense or selfesteem. Occasionally Kitten does display some perspicacity and even maturity to reveal sanity and intelligence as well as considerable artistic creativity behind those wideeyed baby blues such as when she explains the layers of meaning behind the title and a prolife theology that embraces all differences to find family as well as finally dealing with parent issues.Murphy's performance is simply astounding. I've used gendered pronouns to indicate when the charming hunk from Girl With Pearl Earring or interMission or Red Eye completely becomes a woman throughout his body no matter the camera angles like no other straight male actor before has ever become a male to female transsexual on screen Lee Pace's performance in A Soldier's Girl is the closest comparison. Kitten can be annoying but she is always a real person not a guy in drag.The supporting cast is wonderfully atmospheric particularly the lesserknown players Ruth Negga and Laurence Kinlan as Kittens lifelong friends and Ian Hart as an aggressive cop turned protector.The Brit and Irish pop music selections on the soundtrack are brilliant. About half are unfamiliar to American audiences including cover versions of others' hits. The songs are perfectly selected for either lyrics or period evocation or rhythm or emotion such as two Van Morrison tunes Madame George and Cypress Avenue for additional commentary on the action. It's hard not to hum along.A warning to American audiences that the Irish brogues are quite thick I'd welcome seeing the film with not just the robins subtitled. This is exacerbated by Murphy's adopted feminine voice and swallowed cadence which not only can get irritating but seemed undermiked or not postdubbed. I sympathized when cops were trying to shake him out of these mannerisms. The extremely long credits at the end would seem to indicate some union feather bedding in exchange for the location shooting financial benefits.".

The main point about the movie is that it focuses on Patrick and what happens to him. Not the random drama of a woman trapped in a man's body. That is what really defines movie. It really does not try to tell us how dramatic a life of a transvestite can be. It says these are caused by the dreamlike desires of a boy any boy. The movie also is very intimate it feels like if you were to walk right in the scene and start talking to the characters they would be okay with it. Patricia Kitten Braden is not a character that you would encounter everyday. However remote his existence feels he is real just the same. Although in the beginning he is a bit offensive against people who tries to ''correct'' him. That changes as his journey continues. The more he is accepted the ''nicer'' he becomes. When he is young he might even look as if he is trying to provoke people but then again don't we all? Patrick's positive and even unrealistic approach to life seems to help him remain quite unwounded throughout his life.

	schema:headline " Disappointing feature";
	schema:reviewBody "I have rather enjoyed Neil Jordan's films in the past. Things like Interview With The Vampire and In the Company of Wolves had a lovely surreal quality that appealed to me.The movie follows the life story of Partick Kitty Bergen a young Irishman abandoned by his mother in the 1960s. Growing up he develops a penchant for dressing up as a woman and is shockingly open about sex and sexuality a quality that rankles with his adopted family and the other inhabitants of Irish village he grows up in.

I found the long biographical structure of the story unnecessary and I didn't think we needed to go into that much depth about Kitty's background. It would have been more fun if the film focused on his life as an adult. It would have provided the story with more of a centre and made the long running time much shorter.Furthermore actors such as Bryan Ferry Liam Neeson and especially Jordan regular Stephen Rea were woefully underutilised and I would have liked to have seen some more of their characters.A small disappointment from a filmmaker I really admire.".

Things like Interview With The Vampire and In the Company of Wolves had a lovely surreal quality that appealed to me.The movie follows the life story of Partick Kitty Bergen a young Irishman abandoned by his mother in the 1960s. Growing up he develops a penchant for dressing up as a woman and is shockingly open about sex and sexuality a quality that rankles with his adopted family and the other inhabitants of Irish village he grows up in. He decides to flee the village to and look for his mother...Despite a strong central performance from Cillian Murphy as Kitty not to mention quality turns from all the supporting cast for me the movie didn't quite work.

	schema:reviewBody "BREAKFAST ON PLUTO is now on DVD and perhaps that will garner the larger audience it deserves after its scant art house run on the big screen. In every way this is a tender sensitive sweet story full of hope faith indefatigable courage and persistence that is embellished by a first class performance by the gifted Cillian Murphy.Ireland late 50s early 60s and a child is left abandoned on the doorstep of the local priest Liam Neeson. The priest hurriedly places the infant with a foster mother and we watch the little boy Patrick Braden slowly grow into a crossdressing child with outsider friends loathed by his adopted mother to the point where he is unable to cope with life as a lie and makes off to London as a transvestite gay man now going by the name 'Kitten Braden'. He hopes to find his birth mother and his search leads him through the dregs of London the city that 'swallowed up' his real mother becoming involved with the seamier side of the city jailed mistakenly becoming an apprentice to a magician Stephen Rea a cabaret singer etc until he finally makes the discovery of his beginnings  his true parents  and his journey to find happiness ends sweetly.The entire cast of this long over two hours film is so fine that never for an instant does the pace of the tale let up. The cinematography by Declan Quinn is splendid the costumes by Eimer Ni Mhaoldomhnaigh are some of the best recreations of the 70's on film and the musical score by Anna Jordan mixes her own creations with the wonderful tunes from the era and the result is brilliantly integrated into the film. Director Neil Jordan adapted the screenplay from Patrick McCabe's fine novel and finds all the magic and makes it visual. But in the long run if we are unable to identify and care about Patrick 'Kitten' Braden the movie would seem silly. Cillian Murphy is such an honest actor having spent time preproduction living with transvestites about whom he speaks so tenderly in the featurette and gives a multifaceted glitteringly fine performance. This is a fun entertaining and important film. Highly Recommended for all audiences! Grady Harp".

The plot is a bit too complex for its 90 minute running time with gunfire exploding often when you least expect it.

And there are a couple of moments where I swear I missed some plot point or other but found I was simply carried along with the momentum and didn't care for long.. It clearly wants to make a commentary on the use of media by organizations to look good and it mostly succeeds. I'm also certain that the parallels to how the US Government is doing a similar thing in Iraq was probably unintentional even if it does make you think.This is a very good and very off beat film that moves to its own beat.

	schema:reviewBody "Breaking News Dai si gein is one of the most urban crime thrillers I've ever seen using the density and verticality of a modern city as an intense frame for the fastpaced action.Hong Kong here seems to have visually become like the futuristic cities with satellite cameras of Blade Runner and Code 46 with almost all the action taking place with 360 degree views of narrow streets crowded plazas dark hallways and elevator shafts. There's a doortodoor attack in a corridor that throws down the now classic scene from Oldboy as so much balletic nonsense compared to this gritty but very beautiful realism with cinematography by Siukeung Cheng. Director Johnny To grabs our attention in the enthralling opening scene of a shootout on a Hong Kong street. With almost no dialog we can figure out that this is a stakeout going horribly wrong. While the scene dizzyingly must have been shot on a cherrypicker zooming up and down and around as if we are on on external elevator or hanging from windows with a zoom telephoto lens the angles are always important as the camera swoops and narrows and broadens our view from shooter to victim to shooter to victim as we swivel to where the shots are heard. I felt like I was in the antenna of the aliens in War of the Worlds. The visuals are always directly related to the sounds as edited by David M. Richardson.Though I could only infer some of the internal politics within the police bureaucracy with the significance of some using English names and others traditional Chinese names amidst the various competing levels of authority some of whom spoke stilted English it was easy enough to pick up on the techie criminalist statistician vs. the on the ground street cop a terrific Nick Cheung who is like a thinking cop's Bruce Willis let alone the difficulties a woman cop Kelly Chen has on the force. Her need to prove herself and her modern approach is a driving theme in the film and gives it considerable difference from a more conventional crime drama. She may be a neophyte at being in charge but she is not an idiot.There are parallel old schoolnew school gangsters vs. assassins with different rules and technology that get caught up in the siege though I wasn't sure of the details of all their intersecting plots. The criminals are considerably more charismatic than all the cops except Inspector Cheung and have a sense of humor during an amusing hostage taking. The instant realtime new and old media attention in what is as much a doortodoor war between cops and criminals as in Black Hawk Down becomes part of their battle plans. It is as violent as a Paul Schrader or Martin Scorcese film but has the mordant cynicism and humor of Billy Wilder as the violence mocks the continued blandishments we see from the government officials about the falling crime rate.While script writers HingKa Chan and TinShing Yip may have intended the high tech PRcontrolling official to be a satire like Wag the Dog in having controlling the press be an essential component of controlling crime it is just a very small step beyond the NYC Police Department techniques innovated under former Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. So it's a running gag that a kid with access to the Web can outwit their media manipulations. Survival seems to be based more on the results of the battle for public opinion.I wasn't sure if the Hong Kong police force always looks like storm troopers or if the production design was making a political point. Clearly there was some point to the hostages being surrounded by commercial symbols of Western capitalism and culture.The music by Ben Cheung and Chi Wing Chung supports the tension very effectively including electronica and traditional instrumentation.Unfortunately the film as distributed in theaters in the U.S. had the worst subtitles I have ever seen. Not only are they filled with spelling and quizzical grammatical errors as well as frequently white on white they seem to have been translated using an antique English dictionary. The most egregious distraction is constantly calling these bloody murderers the charming appellation of bandits  how about thugs or gangsters or criminals or crooks or bad asses and so forth. Why didn't a native English speaker look over these subtitles? At least the credits were mostly bilingual.".

	schema:reviewBody "The script is twisted and not exactly what you consider stateoftheart in terms of European or American cinema. But it's Johnny To so you know what you'll get. The cinematography is brilliant the acting unfortunately mediocre it isn't as intense as in Johnny To's last movie Throwdown. But still I like this one better for the Honk Kong pictures and the astonishing opening scene which was filmed uninterrupted for just about five minutes including camera elevations camera entering appartments a decent shoot out and a lot of 180 turns without any single cut. The staging of the action in the giant apartment building is tense and gives a disorientation that prepares you for any surprise. Gangsters on floor 9C. Police on floor 8B. But they need minutes to clash and one never knows what comes next. After short shootings everyone spreads in another direction and the situation is anything but clear. This is big cinema and gives a new idea how action and tension can be staged besides boring Hollywood standards. This movie owes greatly to the atmosphere of Hong Kong. Crowded streets huge apartment blocks with the air conditions sticking out like giant bee hives big limos... and not to forget all the different branches of HK police that always seem to quarrel with each other rather than fighting criminals. If anyone could explain the different branches of HK police and how they interact feel free to send me an email. There is no good and bad in this movie as the gangsters reveal sympathetic traits of character while cooking for the family taken hostage  they would have become rather cooks and own a restaurant than being uncle killer and uncle bandit. The police appears to be completely disoriented and rather eager to get publicity than fighting the bad guys who are especially clever to use the media in their favor. The movie is probably ment as a satire on public organs such as the police and the manipulation of today's mass media to influence public opinion. As I'm no big philosopher I'm gonna stop evaluating right here. For all HK fans and everyone that enjoys a nice camera work including some shoot outs  you definitely have to watch this movie. I had the honor to attend a screening of this movie during the VIENNALE in Vienna on the giant Gartenbau Kino Screen.".

	schema:reviewBody "There aren't many films that even try to be innovative these days so when one comes along that does we ought to be willing to give it the benefit of any doubt. So yes I think the film could have been just a little better polished but it's a solid entry even as it is.In an era when crime thrillers seem to be all made for MTV  flashy glossy videogameplay  Johnnie To has delivered a tough gritty realistic study in obsession and professionalism. It is the police who in differing ways are very obsessed and the criminals who are all professionals. And of course it seems up to the media to spin the story the other way around so 'decent citizens' can feel safe in their grimy little apartments like that of the cowardly 'father' who slips out on his own kids.I've read the review comparing this to Natural Born Killers but the visual innovations used here work on a completely different level. Oliver Stone references all kinds of media not as social comment he uses them too frequently in many different contexts but rather because he accepts that American culture today is its media. For Johnnie To the issue runs a little deeper. His visuals are not so much satirical comment on media as they are attempts to raise the question Just how do we define ourselves publicly in the age of electronic media? or does the media inevitably define us? Even the obsessed CID cop who clearly has no interest in the media becomes a TV prop at the end  only the criminals remain enigmas and thus retain a kind of humanity  despite the fact that they are coldblooded killers through and through being coldblooded killers is part of their job after all. When they're not committing crime their probably just like the nextdoor neighbors one has promised another to attend the funeral of his son after the job gets done. That's actually a pretty scary thought itself.This is the kind of film the Ray Liotta film Narc wanted to be but sentimentally backed down from at all the most important moments. While Hong Kong's better directors can get awfully sentimental they never let this force them to pull any punches. In the recent Tsui Hark film Time and Tide which has plenty sentiment to spare a cop and a crook suddenly find themselves pointing guns at each other's heads the cop says So now we're equal. The crook immediately shoots him in the head and only then remarks my gun kills it doesn't talk. He then shoots the dead cop a halfdozen more times just for the heck of it.To's film works on a similar level and I like it more since the criminals here are much more believable. It is very tense throughout and able to surprise in an era when most of us believe their are no surprises left to film. That gives it an added value in my book. It kept me watching throughout and I think it will do so for most viewers.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wow is this a tense actionpacked film. So much so that I felt my heart racing throughout the film and I was on the edge of my seat! While I usually HATE action films this one was something elsean intelligently made action film and one of the few in this genre that I can wholeheartedly recommend! Why it only has an IMDb score of 6.6 is completely beyond me.Unlike many action films while there are a lot of explosions and gun fire there also is an intelligent parallel plot that has to do with the news media and how the government will manage and manipulate the news to best meet their needs. This was brilliant but I was also very surprised as this film was made in Chinaa country NOT known for its freedom of expression. Here the filmmakers have a cynical attitude towards the cops and their occasionally dishonest attempts to manipulate the press. This parallel plot makes this movie far more than just mindless violence but social commentary. A onedimensional violent film is a complaint I have with many other action filmsbut not this one. The film begins with an undercover surveillance mission by the police. Two uniformed cops blunder into the operation and this results in a massive shootoutand it's obvious that the crooks are far better armed than the police. Eventually most of the bad guys get free and take refuge in a highrise apartmentwhere most of the film takes place.Despite a very simple plot idea the film never lets up or becomes just an action feature. Again and again I was amazed at the intelligence of the writing and intensity of the film without managing to be gratuitously bloody or violent. Yes this certainly is a violent film but despite all the shooting and explosions the body count is amazingly low and it does not look quite as intensely violent some of the John Woo films. Excellent writing direction and acting make this a mustsee film for the genre.Watch this film...just be sure you DON'T watch it with children or those who are bothered by violent imagery.PSI noticed that one reviewer complained about the bad subtitles. While the film I saw didn't have perfect subtitles there were a few grammatical errors here and there they were nothing like the ones they described. There were no white captions on white background and I don't recall words like bandits being used. I assume there must be another version out there as I saw the film on the Sundance Channel and it wasn't bad at all. It is also possible I have seen so many badly captioned Asian films that this one looked pretty good to meand believe me there are MANY badly captioned Asian films.".

Looking for a chance to redeem themselves the police once again track down the gang in an apartment building and stage a realTV type of event with hundreds of cameras to show the city of Hong Kong that they can do their job properly. Things get interesting when the crooks fire back with their own video of the incident and it is also revealed that there is not one gang in the building but two.From the opening 7 or so minute scene that has no cuts and culminates in a shootout to the unpredictability of the rest of the movie this is film that really grabs your attention as if itself were a piece of breaking news. Interesting is the fact that the breaking news almost breaks the reputation of the police. The ability of the media to get information literally everywhere in the blink of an eye is given an interesting commentary in that it can hurt the police as much as a raging shootout. And how can anyone in such a hectic and tiresome line of work be able to do anything correctly or according to some procedure if they have everyone else around them breathing down on their neck? It is possible when your success rate is high but the moment you fail you are treated with a badgering as this film demonstrates.All in all this is more a film about the media then it is about the police. The media are in the background throughout and the cops and crooks are the main characters but it is the effect of an information hungry media that essentially is the driving force for the events in the film. The film's use of newslike footage is another thing  you want to know and see what is going to happen next but it is that precise constant peering over the shoulder that hinders the police in doing their job. That makes for an interesting take on the crimecaper genre with the traditional drives like greed and corruption almost totally set aside. 810Not rated yet at least but contains R level violence.".

This movie does right that and criticizes a too close relationship. Besides the story the movie is a cool actionmovie with a totally different style than the average western Hollywoodlike action movie. Cool camerawork nice differentangle shot and other cool stuff. It's just nice to watch. The viewer can see many shootings but the humor does not come to short especially the characters are quite funny. A negative aspect might be the usage of the Bondeffect no bullet hits a good guy. But IMHO a cool action movie needs this effect. Otherwise there would be too many characters and there would be no development of these characters. All in All 810 which means Watch it!".

	schema:reviewBody "I guess the holidays now give me some extra breathing space and time to raid my DVD library for many films yet unseen and given my profound admiration of films coming out of Hong Kong's Milkyway Studios such as the recent Sparrow or Mad Detective that I would pull Breaking News out of my archives and give it a go too. Helmed by Johnnie To and written by Chan HingKa and Yup TinShing like the other two films mentioned this was also picked up by a European film festival Cannes no less and probably propelled To to cult like status in the West with legions of fan myself included left almost always anticipating what's To has up his sleeves as his next offering.True interest in the Hong Kong crime genre might be waning but To and his band of filmmakers from Milkyway have so far never disappointed in giving the genre some breath of fresh air with each offering put on the table. Here they managed to put a little spin on a tale between the cops felons and the media where the latter can be used as a double edged sword subject to manipulation to further the political gains of either parties. Exploitation doesn't come from just the cops because even the villains have their fare share of independent ability to put out material thanks to new media tools for video and picture hosting. In some ways this is a little bit like Dog Day Afternoon or 15 Minutes but given a different take from the Fragrant Harbour.If anything the opening scene is where the money shot is and cement this film as a classic amongst To's filmography. It's an almost seven minute long continuous take where we get introduced to almost everyone from the cops in question to the villains organizing themselves to move out for their big heist building tension when everything comes together for an all out showdown with the surveillance team hot at their heels. It's a shoot out from all fronts and the camera captures it all in one sweeping motion before we head toward the crowded open streets for more mayhem ala Heat which culminates in a clip taken by the media when a beat cop surrenders in full view to the criminals allowing them to escape instead of apprehending them.With the criminals on the loose a cop obsessed to take them down the police's public image being tainted and a commissioner adamant in repairing the force's reputation Breaking News is an enjoyable thriller with fine balance between the dramatics as well as in the action department where SDU and PTU units get deployed to flush out the bad guys in some claustrophobic inducing cramped quarters of a block of flats.Richie Jen has this steely cool resolve as chief villain Yuen who leads his boys from the Mainland in a game of survival having their plans for a heist end prematurely and finding themselves up against a hard nosed cop Cheung played by Nick Cheung despite being armed to the teeth. Nick Cheung is pretty charismatic here in his role despite being nothing more than an action hero though if you would like to see him in more dramatic material then the recent Beast Stalker would be the appropriate choice. Kelly Chen rounds up the leading trio as the opportunistic Commissioner Rebecca Fong entrusted by the upper echelons with the responsibility to restore pride to the force in the eyes of the media and public and she goes into overdrive with her single minded focus on just that.Being a Milkyway film some Johnnie To regulars also make their way here to lend gravitas even though in supporting roles. Simon Yam came on and suggested some romantic tangles with Chen's Fong while Maggie Siu's cop from the PR department allowed for some measured and experienced handling both within the department and with the media on the outside. Cheung Siu Fai was dished out a rather plain character though more like a Yes Man while Yong You's character was more of a wildcard who provided the good guys an extra dimension to deal with. The affable Lam Suet's role as a dad caught between the crossfire allowed for some interesting camaraderie forged during a hostage situation and is now one of my favourite of his supporting roles in many of To's films.For fans of the genre and of Johnnie To this is one movie that should not be missed. It had plenty of elements which made it genre defining and for those who enjoy the many films of his which come with some intelligence required on the part of the good guys when hunting down their enemies then Breaking News firmly belongs in that territory. Highly recommended!".

The action is good but it as a commentary on the role of media in society that the film works best. Kelly Chen is excellent as the constantly cool and collected young superintendent who approves the cameras citing the need to put on a great show to win back the public. Nothing is quite on the level though with discussion of editing the footage before it is broadcast. The question also arises of whether the police see a greater need in nailing the criminals or making themselves simply look good. Things grow more complex as the criminals decide to broadcast their own videos online and everything culminates in a memorable finale. The plot sometimes feels excessively padded out though the basic story is slim and subplots like cooking a meal and a hostage trying to escape are distracting. None of the supporting characters are especially well developed either. Generally speaking though the film is encapsulating throughout. Especially interesting is Chen's constant barking of orders from the comfort and safety of her headquarters. Is she putting her officers' lives on the line to serve and protect the public or to serve and protect the department's image?".

Johnnie To is starting to really specialise in this genre which is nice as it is so refreshing to see it done outside the Hollywood narrow minded frame of completely OTT everything.Although this film does have a few hit issues. Like how many bullets can a guy take? How long can one scene stay strong we're talking 7 minutes here folks!? Can one opening scene be this long yet the action so extremely violent and snappy? Can audiences tolerate the glamour of the action yet cry for the broken family in the middle? Can the audience relate to the ultra threat of TV used by the killers for their own advantage as much as the cop's own advantage? This film is just a really fun outing of action thrills stunning cinematography with a very heavy extra cast in police uniform. This one has an added dose of family drama and TV station morality ala Dog Day Afternoon. In this case it's more of the dangerous angle of a TV crew. The news has had such an epic presence in the years and the film just turns news on its head.Instead of the news becoming the standby it becomes the core of the film. It's a tale of struggle for power over the TV station in a big Hong Kong flat block.I for one am a bit tedius of Hollywood action and find this film inviting although you really should not take it to seriously with the shots fired and how many times should that guy be dead issue? Come on. Just look at the drivel which Hollywood makes us believe. They're so clueless they can only come up now with Asian remakes and comic idols from yesteryear.Brain De Palma could do a great rendition of this film as could Michael Mann. Lots of wide 35m shots would suit Mann well. Johnnie To and Michael Mann are clearly very favoursome of similar camera techniques which is fantastic. If you love 'Heat' and want to get in on more similar titles without the Hollywood bore then get more Johnnie To.A great film but please do not take body count hits seriously. It's a movie after all.".

	schema:headline " Roll sound roll camera ACTION!";
	schema:reviewBody "This one is for all diehard action fans. And it delivers...From the stunning sixplus minute long take of the first shootout between the cops and the gangsters the action just doesn't stop as a set of four cops attempt to rundown five gangsters. In fact that first long take is so well done it's worth seeing this movie just for that even if you don't want to see the rest of it.And that first take reminded me very strongly of that escape sequence in Heat 1995 when Robert de Niro and gang run the gauntlet of hundreds of cops as they try to get away with millions in cash.However not only is Breaking News a welldone action flick it's also a notsosubtle satire about how the police and the media manipulate the news for their own separate ends. And coupled with some tongueincheek scenes whereby all the action ceases for a meal break plus an almost obligatory exchange of views via the Internet between the bad guys holed up in an apartment block and the cops in the command post  a touch of humour amidst all the touches of larceny...With such a fast paced story there's not much room for character development you would think. Well there's where you'd be wrong from the frenetic determination of Inspector Cheung Nick Cheung to the CoolHandLuke competence of the bad boss Yuen Richie Ren to the icy calm and control of Commissioner Rebecca Fong Kelly Chen all ably supported by an excellent cast of oddball characters director Johnny To must be lauded for being able to show quickly  with a sharp script also  just how likable or unlikable the characters are. No mean feat in my opinion.One of the most pleasing aspects about this film for me however was the complete absence of any martial arts from any of the characters.Great photography within the seedier parts of Hong Kong coupled with superior editing of the action sequences kept my interest going and only marred by some of the more obvious mistakes with special effects  particularly how bullet holes magically appeared on car hoods tops or sides when no shots were fired at them. Or worse when cars in the line of fire magically escaped being hit. But I can forgive minor mishaps with timing.You never find out what the gangsters actually did to warrant being chased you never find out exactly why the cops had them under observation in the first place you never find out just why Commissioner Fong hates Inspector Cheung's guts so much. It's like as the viewer you turn on your TV to watch a reallife action drama of cops fighting it out with a gang somewhere in your city and you sit transfixed waiting to see what happens...Guess what? That's what it is  everyday almost breaking news.".

	onyx:emotionText "This one is for all diehard action fans. And it delivers...From the stunning sixplus minute long take of the first shootout between the cops and the gangsters the action just doesn't stop as a set of four cops attempt to rundown five gangsters. In fact that first long take is so well done it's worth seeing this movie just for that even if you don't want to see the rest of it.And that first take reminded me very strongly of that escape sequence in Heat 1995 when Robert de Niro and gang run the gauntlet of hundreds of cops as they try to get away with millions in cash.However not only is Breaking News a welldone action flick it's also a notsosubtle satire about how the police and the media manipulate the news for their own separate ends. And coupled with some tongueincheek scenes whereby all the action ceases for a meal break plus an almost obligatory exchange of views via the Internet between the bad guys holed up in an apartment block and the cops in the command post  a touch of humour amidst all the touches of larceny...With such a fast paced story there's not much room for character development you would think.

I read some of the reviews on this film posted here after I saw the film and I am really sorry for you people who trash this film you are either so spolied and programmed by the fantasy of Hollywood films or just don't get it?. Rarely does film in Hollywood dares to go this deep about two people in a relationship and trial and emotional complexities that don't make any logical sense to any of us who have been in relationships that were hard to let go of.I think this film really appeals to more of a European audience than American because you the US audience always wants to live in some kind of fantasy world White Boy meets White Girl they fall in love and live happily ever after. Now if something different comes along that requires your attention and becomes a little too real then you trash it.What is even more sad that there is a hardly an audience for this kind of film in the US as it is in Europe. This was originally a play and that is pretty obvious from the fact its based on two people without the side kicks of friends in your usual gimmick movies. Some of the conversations may seem tedious and long at times but for those of you who have been involved in relationships that sometimes don't make sense then you can relate at because you can't make any sense out of human emotions then you would understand it and relate to it. I guess what made this film not as appealing to some like Harry Met Sally did is because it didn't have all the little cute scenes that like Sally pretending to have a orgasm in a restaurant that's what sells in a Hollywood film but Breaking Up is not such a film and never pretended to be either it was more honest than any film that deals with relationships than most films ever do in Hollywood and it doesn't have a happy ending either and this is where the US audience needs to GROW UP.Selma Hayek really gave a great performance in this film I am not even a fan nor did I ever like any of her films but I really thought she did a great job in this film and so did Russel Crow. This film would not probably a choice for either of them today but trust me if there was a way to remake this film with two huge stars and add a some side kicks and slap a happy ending to it you then suddenly people will be raving about it. I think this is a film that only appeals to those who can relate to it and appreciate its for the crazy and insane parts of any intense relationship. There is a line in this film where both characters years later say ..they never really understood why they even broke up? and I think that was what this film was about what makes any relationship work? and how do you make any logical sense of it when you are so caught up in it emotionally and how do you come out of it and deal with the pain and misery of loosing someone.

	schema:headline " Inventive quirky film with high aspirations for itself";
	schema:reviewBody "I have always thought that we should fall in love with people for their dreams and for their efforts to fulfill those dreamsnot for their accomplishments. Love a man because he's a brilliant actor and aspires to greatnessnot because he can take you to the Oscars when he's nominated for Best Actor.That philosophy informs my opinion of this movie. It sets out many lofty goals for itself. It wants to demonstrate and lay out for examination the entire plight of heterosexual lovelust. It wants two actors to carry an entire movie virtually by themselves playing against each other giving the film a stifled claustrophobic feelingwhere the viewer feels just like Steve and Monica. You love the movie but you feel breathless and spent like you've given too much. It wants to tell a story using live onthestreet interviews blackandwhite still photography slowmo vignettes traditional Hollywoodstyled cinematography and a splitscreen interview of Steve and Monica postrelationship. It wants to use music and sound to resonate with the storyline. My favorite ten minutes of the film center around the carrot scene where Steve criticizes Monica for putting carrots in the pasta. The action stops and moves to bw stills with the sounds of their argument carrying over. This technique highlights the alienation that Steve and Monica feel from themselves and their own relationship. Even in the most heated passionate argument it's as if they're just going through the motions.Like I said this film wants to do a lot of things and it doesn't succeed at all of them. For instance it doesn't really pull off its attempt at using Freud Einstein and Marx to lend some credence to its own conclusions or inconclusions about love. Some people say they never do become very attached to Steve and Monicaindeed as people the characters kind of suck. I would not want either one of them for a friend. That does not mean that they do not deserve to be loved howeverthey very much deserve each other that much is clear. So I bawl like a baby every time I watch this. I've seen it about 6 or so times. And I love this movie for the greatness it strives toward. I would rather watch a film that fails at its grand project than a little movie that has low expectations and meets them. Big whoop right? More than this Breaking Up features two brilliant performances by Russell Crowe and Salma Hayek who are both quite easy on the eye and look great together. Salma's fiery spirit is quite a cinematic match for Russell's own undercurrent of simmering violence even if Steve is a bit whimpy for my tastes. I love this film. Technically there is so much going onthe director had so many great ideas so many dreams and you see them right there in the movie. I can't think of another Hollywood movie with such a major confluence of established styles and innovative techniques. Brilliant.Buy this film. It is absolutely worth it and fans of Russell andor Salma should know that there are some beautifullyshot utterly sensuous and compelling love scenes in this film. Those two have chemistry.".

	onyx:emotionText "I have always thought that we should fall in love with people for their dreams and for their efforts to fulfill those dreamsnot for their accomplishments. Love a man because he's a brilliant actor and aspires to greatnessnot because he can take you to the Oscars when he's nominated for Best Actor.That philosophy informs my opinion of this movie. It sets out many lofty goals for itself. It wants to demonstrate and lay out for examination the entire plight of heterosexual lovelust. It wants two actors to carry an entire movie virtually by themselves playing against each other giving the film a stifled claustrophobic feelingwhere the viewer feels just like Steve and Monica. You love the movie but you feel breathless and spent like you've given too much. It wants to tell a story using live onthestreet interviews blackandwhite still photography slowmo vignettes traditional Hollywoodstyled cinematography and a splitscreen interview of Steve and Monica postrelationship.

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this movie for the first time last night and was completely blown away.  I read somewhere that it came from a stage play and you definitely get the feeling for that.  So all of those of you who can't sit through movies like The Big Kahuna or Glengarry Glen Ross because nothing happens don't bother trying to watch this  you'll be bored.  But for those of you who want to watch a movie about something that will actually deal with it rather than pander to the lowest common denominator you might want to give this movie a shot.One reason I liked it so much is that I like a healthy dose of symbolism in my movies and this movie has it in spades.  A lot of the complaints that I've seen about this movie is that the movie never tells us what is keeping these two characters apart.  There may be spoilers ahead.  Well the answer it seems to me is that these characters symbolize men and women in love not just individual characters.  Men are often seeking independence and individuality while women are often looking for reassurance of love. Yes those were two big stereotypes but the reason they are stereotypes is because you see them so often in reality.  And the fact that the two characters go out to interview people on the street about how to stay in relationships I get the feeling that the movie is trying to broaden its horizon beyond these two characters.The other reason I liked this movie is that it recognizes that real love that passionate feeling that controls your actions whether you want it to or not is so intense that it has a tendency to both pull people together and tear them apart.  I especially liked the way it brought in the philosophies of Marx Einstein and Freud to give the movie's ideas context from history science and psychology.The final thing that caught my attention was the way the the movie tried to make a universal statement about love vs. happiness because they aren't the same thing and the best way to make it through this muddled life may not have anything to do with either even if it is dull.  I found the whole thing very fascinating and insightful.And if that hasn't completely scared you off it is an incredibly funny and touching movie.  I laughed as I recognized my own reactions to relationships brought to life in front of me.  The performances are wonderful.  Russell Crowe is one of the best actors working now and Salma shows that she has a real talent waiting to come out to play.  So if you're still with me and this sounds like something that will appeal to your particular tastes you might want to give it a chance.".

I found this unknown romantic comedy that looked interesting.Hayak and Russell Crowe have been together for two and a half years. The only time their relationship works is when they are having sex. The rest of the the time they argue until one leaves. They can't understand why it doesn't work no matter what they try. That's it. 90 minutes of them breaking up and getting back together to have sex and breaking up and getting back together. It was funny and interesting and since Salma was not out of my sight for more than 30 seconds the entire movie it was satisfying. Not prurient just satisfying.What was most interesting is the fact that it was directed by Robert Greenwald. I have everything he has directed in the last four years Iraq for Sale The War Profiteers 2006 WalMart The High Cost of Low Price 2005 Outfoxed Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism 2004 Uncovered The War on Iraq 2004 and Uncovered The Whole Truth About the Iraq War 2003. I have even seen films he has produced but not directed like The ACLU Freedom Files. I always thought he did documentaries about things that were wrong with America. I had no idea that he directed movies like The Burning Bed or Xanadu. Now I do.".

Me either but this film expects you to. Story is about a couple that have been dating for a few years but decide that they should break up and after spending some time apart it doesn't take long before they start calling each other and getting together for great sex. Steve Russell Crowe and Monica Salma Hayek talk about that they are not together anymore but still hop into bed with one another and then talk and argue until one of them leaves. Later one of them will phone the other up and the whole process starts again with sex talk and more arguing.SPOILER ALERTOne day Steve shows up at Monica's work and tells her that they should get married and after mulling about it for a short time she accepts. Steve starts dreaming and when he finally wakes up he is at the altar but he is unable to utter the words I do and passes out. Monica has had it with him and leaves him for good and even though he doesn't want her to leave there isn't anything he can say to change her mind.This film is directed by Robert Greenwald who was either handicapped by an extremely thin budget or has no clue how to construct a real film. This was shot in New York City but aside from a taxi with New York printed on the doors you would have been hard pressed to figure out where it's suppose to take place. There isn't one good shot of that beautiful city and instead the films focus remains on the two lead actors and even with their immense talent they just cannot keep the audiences attention on something so trivial and mundane. Glenda Jackson starred in a film called Stevie in the 1970's and she had to carry that film herself also and even though I thought she succeeded this is a task that's practically impossible even for the best actors. It all boils down to the material that they are handed and this script is just to dull. Some have said that Crowe and Hayek have no chemistry on screen but I'm not so quick to agree with that because the lines that they are forced to utter is so banal. Greenwald directed this film from the play by Michael Cristofer and I'm not sure what drew his attention to this but the end result is a dull film that is both poorly constructed and repetitious.".

For those who like movies where characterization drives the plot in other words you don't mind a lot of talking  lack of action then you will enjoy this film.It is also a great chance to see two actors Russell Crowe and Salma Hayek strutting their stuff.  These two actors have such great chemistry together you REALLY believe that these two are a couple who can't live with each other but can't live without each other.  I was immediately reminded of Noel Coward's Private Lives.This is basically a two actor piece and a showcase for both actors.  It is both funny and heartbreaking to watch these two desperately try to work out their differences and live together happily.  Both characters are very realistically drawn and it is nice that neither character is show to be completely at fault for the failure of the relationship.  Both have problems he's out of touch and fearful of change she over analyses and is at bit of a pain.I found myself identifying with both characters on and off but mostly and surprisingly with the Russell Crowe character.  Usually the men in such films are never given much motivation for their reluctance to commit. But in this film we find out why he is fearful and it is a reason men AND women can relate to!  Both sexes can also relate to Salma Hayek's character's frustrations with his pettiness and her reluctance to believe that he sincerely loves her.For all of those ladies who think Salma Hayek can not act several friends have made such comments to me check out this film!  This is the best opportunity she has EVER been given in a film.  She is really turns in a brilliant and moving performance.  After seeing Breaking Up I'm looking forward to seeing what opportunities she is given in Frieda Kahlo.My only gripe would be the ending!  I guess I'm a hopeless  romantic because I hoped they would somehow wind up together at  the end of the film! But it does add a realistic if heart breaking  touch that is not often seen in Hollywood films.".

At the start both characters are talking to an unseen interviewer or counselor or maybe just to the camera they also talk just to the camera in a later scene. They are giving good performances at that point. Then things go downhill quickly.The film was not a total waste of time.The best part of the movie had Steve and Monica doing what appeared to be a documentary shot in black and white where they interviewed ordinary people on the street about malefemale relationships. These people seemed real and may in fact have been real they certainly weren't shown in the credits. One little girl said the best thing to do with a man was 'dump him in the garbage'.Also good a sequence of fantasies about what the wedding might be like inside a church involving a demented minister an Einstein lookalike and Steve and Monica both lying on couches with a psychiatrist between them.Salma Hayek looked good in a swimsuit. Too bad that was only in a fantasy Steve's actually where a Fabio type with Schwarzenegger muscles was bench pressing her.Several scenes had really good music most of the good music being real jazz. There was also 40sstyle easy listening. And then there was contemporary music that didn't appeal to me at all. Well what can you expect when the man in charge of music led Devo? One scene was spoiled for me when the trumpet and the standup bass were cut off prematurely when the couple started bickering again.I'm not sure what this meant but several sequences other than the 'documentary' were filmed in black and white with no dialogue from the characters on screen. Two had quick editing and gave the impression of quality. One had Steve and Monica in a restaurant with a series of different dates in what appeared to be just a few minutes as the camera went back and forth between them. The only way this could have been a good movie is if it was in fact one of those art films that appeals to the people who go to coffee houses and listen to poetry. I'm not one of those.".

The whole film is one and the same recurrent scene  and plot turns urge a huge question mark in respect to normal human logic patience and reason. It is hard to conceive how our good Lord could share the throne of the world with Devil but human relationships are always understandable. The characters in the movie mentioned a word love' a couple of times but whatever it was in the end the kind of relationship those two people had in the course of the movie gives a clear indication that it was not love even at the beginning  that was all what the bare lust can produce and you could still cheer yourself up with catching the flashes of the seductive Salma's body.

Ultimately you end up with two frustrating people in a pointless relationship that is a circle of hope and failure over and over again.The fact that the ending left it open for them to get back together was also disturbing. It shows what vapid morons the characters are if they couldn't realise they were right for each other all along and now have to drag their innocent spouses and offspring into divorces.

The effect is rather strangehearing such a highpitched and feminine voice coming from the boy. The effect is a tad creepy. And speaking of creepy the film also features a freaky little girl Irene Dare who appears to be at most 5 yearsold though IMDb indicates she's 7she clearly does not look to be that age. Miss Dare is the combination of two odd sensations of the dayShirley Temple and the ice skating actress Sonja Hennie. The effect of seeing such a tiny girl exploited yes I do mean exploited is amazingly creepyand even worse than people getting rich off Breen. And in an odd twist the plot is about Breen's character being exploited! The film begins in a Mennonite community in Pennsylvania. Breen and his mother silent star Delores Costello are living with Breen's incredibly rigid and moralistic uncle Robert Barrat. Barrat is very religious but also seems to completely miss the meaning of his faithand is very cold and unforgiving. Eventually his rigidity forces young Bobby to run away to Philadelphia to make his fortune. In this pursuit he's accompanied by a real ne'erdowell Charlie Ruggles who again and again exploits the boy's singing talents. When the boy is offered 25 a week to sing Ruggles tells the kid he's earning 5and pockets the rest. Nice guy huh?! Eventually Breen makes good and returns homeonly to be given the cold shoulder by his Hitleriffic uncle. It seems that 20 accidentally disappeared and the uncle insists that Breen stole it. To get back in his family's good graces he sets out to prove his innocencewhich makes it all seem so very very abusive and cruel. At no point does the boy's 'loving mother' intercede and the whole film comes off as bizarre and exploitational.While I did not like the plot nor all the singing and skating mostly because as I said it all seemed to exploit these tykes I must admit that the acting was generally very good. Breen came off as a very sweet kidnatural and easy to like. And Ruggles' character while a bit despicable was also fun to watchmuch like Frank Morgan in The Wizard of Oz or W.C. Fields in pretty much all his films! The overall effect is quite watchable but weirdand probably something best seen only by insane cinephiles like myself!".

	schema:headline " The critics are way overreacting.";
	schema:reviewBody "Now let me begin by saying this film is not an amazing film. It is definitely not an awful film like most critics are saying. I think critics might have raised their expectations due to Thor and XMen First Class. They should not compare the Green Lantern with those films. It is ranked now 24 on Rotten Tomatoes which is way too low. It would probably be in the high 60s if it was released before Thor and XMen First Class.The acting in the film is good and not terrible at all. Ryan Reynolds is great as Hal Jordan and extremely likable. He definitely fits the role as Hal Jordan really well. Blake Lively is great and extremely sexy she's not just a pretty face as most are suggesting. Peter Sarsgaard is a great actor and he plays the villainous Hector Hemmond really well and interesting. Overall everyone tries their best and at the end of the day do a really great job certainly no Oscar worthy performances though.The special effects are pretty superb and extremely worthwhile to say the least. Although it sometimes feel a little CGIish but it doesn't get too big of a distraction. I have to say I was a little disappointed how Parallax looked like it felt a little fake at times but it is not horrible in any sense of the way. Also the film did not take itself seriously which is kind of refreshing. Which could be the reason why critics disliked it so much. They want another sad personal and serious story. Unlike Thor and XMen The Green Lantern is more kids friendly.The main problem of the film was that they were trying to cram stuff in from the comics and the personal lives of the other characters. It seems that there could be so many sequels for the other characters. It did kind of focus on too many characters. Also the editing gets to be a little distracting at times they certainly needed to have done a better job but the editing is mediocre at best.Overall the Green Lantern was a fun summer flick. Although it is nowhere near the realm of The Dark Knight it didn't need to be. The 3D was actually really good and the special effects were memorable. No doubt the critics were extremely tough on the Green Lantern and it is unfair. At the end of the day don't listen to the critics. Make up your mind and see this film. At the end of the day it should be only your opinion that matters to you. You might agree with the critics or you might not. However don't skip this movie because of the low Rotten Tomatoes score.".

Ryan Reynolds did decently as Hal Jordan though he fits more with the Kyle RaynerGuy Gardner type than Jordan  but I wish he was more serious though nonGL fans couldn't care less about this 3. Blake Lively was eye candy super hot but not much else 4. Green Lanterns Tomar Re Kilowog and Abin Sur were damn good but didn't have enough screen time to be significant 5.

This is a summer of superheroes with 3 down and one more to go well technically 5 with Transformers if you're thinking comic book stories so it's quite impossible not to compare them to each other.The director is known to direct good flicks like Goldeneye and Casino Royale two good movies but I wish he did more studied more had split up more stories to be more single minded and not work on a cluttered material.".

	schema:reviewBody "I went to see Green Lantern because a friend of mine was boycotting DC for such a long time because there has been no release of a Green Lantern movie. Sure there were plenty reincarnations of Batman and Superman but where's Green Lantern? Someone out there listened to his plea and the result is this.....A mess.I will go on record to say that it's at least enjoyable. Even though the movie seems to be everywhere in its storytelling with characters being underdeveloped and random things just happening. I would say that during this movie I had a hard time finding a bathroom break. I was at least interested to see where the movie is going.Let me try to explain this movie There is this elite group of Green Lanterns led by Sinestro well played by Mark Strong who are having a hard time beating this giant alien in the Milky Way called The Parallax. So when their alien friend who's name I cannot remember falls to earth and dies his ring is sent out to choose a new victim and somehow it chooses Ryan Reynolds. Mr. Reynolds discovers that he has a new ability and that he is the earth's only hope but he can't handle that until the end of the movie. Not only that but some doctor guy turns into an evil alien which I guess is controlled by Parallax and Ryan has to stop him too.I must say that I was intrigued by the doctor subplot where he is not accepted by his father Tim Robbins and slowly goes insane until he turns into John Travolta from Battlefield Earth. I also liked seeing Ryan Reynolds in the movie because he brings energy to what could otherwise be a boring movie and I was enjoying both stories that were coming along. The problem is that the whole movie felt disjointed and not only did scenes felt random but events turn random too.Like the scene where Reynolds is chosen by the ring. It just happens out of nowhere. One minute he's talking to this kid which never served much purpose to the film and then all of a sudden he's walking and gets carried away in green light to that dying alien dude. This happened in more than one occasion. Also the CGI was all over the place even on Reynold's outfit and it's rather distracting. It's very vibrant and colorful which is good but it looked very cartoonish and took me out of the film. I also mentioned that the characters are underdeveloped which goes a lot to Sinestro and that Parallax thing they are trying to fight. Heck even the love interest felt underdeveloped. By the end of the film I felt like I barely knew the characters with just a likable performance by Ryan Reynolds.However Green Lantern isn't boring just purely average. I think the reason why I sort of liked this film was that I went into it not expecting much. I already had groups of people telling me that this film is awful before its release so I ended up getting a little more than I expected. Just a little. It was still entertaining to say the least.".

No but what super hero movie is? The becoming a Green Lantern of Hal Jordan follows the original comics perfectly. If you know the comics you know the beginning. If you never read them then you learn a lot real fast. The story introduces only characters necessary to the plot and nothing more. Hal Carol Senestro Parallax the Guardians Abin Sur TomarRe and Kilowog. They easily could have introduced way too many guardians way too fast but they didn't. Parallax's origins are changed a little but it works out for the better remember not everything that works in a book works on screen. All in all storyline was good it kept a good pace. Always remember it is an origins story so the 2 hours isn't completely filled with action but neither Casee nor I got bored.Acting 810 No Ryan R. did not screw up Hal Jordan. Alright I'll admit Hal may not be as witty as Ryan played him but Hal was sure as hell a smart ace in the comics. I thought it fit. I went in thinking This is going to be great or really going to suck. Luckily casting was very well done. Carol Blake did a fine job. I do agree with another review that said they wished someone a little more intellectualmature would play Carol but in the long scheme of things Blake didn't get a terrible amount of screen time to prove herself. Maybe as Star Sapphire she may pull out. Lantern Corp Sinestro 1010 TomarRe 1010 Kilowog 1010 Abin Sur 1010 I can't say much else besides that these characters lived up to the comics perfectly. I loved them all.GraphicsCGI 810 Why 8? Eh there were a few just a few I tell you parts where the graphics pulled the cartoon look of Spiderman 3. PLEASE! don't be afraid by this all in all the graphics were awesome. Oa was beautiful just a couple notches below Asgard in Thor. Green Lantern Ring effects were great all around solid.Costumessets 910 First short and sweet. Live action sets average. Skylines just like any other city Ferris Airforce Base good enough. Nothing spectacular but it wasn't the center of the movie. Costumes STOP HATING ON THE CGI COSTUMES!!!!!!! Even the the comics the suits were made from energy and that is what the movie did. A powerful ring of willpower isn't going to POOF put anyone in spandex or rubber armor. The mask appears when the identity of a Lantern needs to be protected and eye color changes as well. PERFECT to me.Length 710 Although as I said before there were a few slow parts I would have liked to see the movie for a few minutes longer. Towards the end yes a little rushed but it didn't ruin the whole movie. 1015 minutes longer to put it just at the 2 hour mark would have been perfect for an origins story to me. Took off a couple points here.Overall 810 By all means it is not as bad as Catwoman or Daredevil as some are writing. Those who make that comment are probably the ones who think Transformers is somehow an epic movie. Anyways it is a good solid super hero movie. Maybe not one of the greats like Batman Begins Dark Knight and Thor but still a great movie that wouldn't be bad to take the mature enough younger kids. Parallax is a little scary and there are a few curse words but by all means this is not a racy film.Remember Stay after the credits...".

Green Lantern is unpretentious probably even one of the most unpretentious superhero movies ever made. It embraces its inherent goofiness and excludes much of the angst and overseriousness that we seen in other comic book movies like Batman and Spiderman. The aftercredits scene is awesome. A real fan pleaser and hopefully they will make a sequel.".

	schema:reviewBody "We are getting decent and compelling superhero movies these days which is a great thing that happened to the genre. Now Green Lantern is one of those films that also needs to be powerful but it ends up being a generic cheesy cinema. Green Lantern is not perfectly horrible or the worst superhero movie ever but it's just too much exposition and a whole lot of green cheese.Green Lantern has a great concept. Just like the other superhero films the storytelling also needs to be compelling. Unfortunately the film gets lazy to tell the story so they just threw a lot of narration and even the ones that are not quite necessary to narrate. The action is not very amazing. it's just showing us how eyecandy the effects are.At least the movie is loyal to its corniness. Hal Jordan's wacky imagination and the aliens' zany looking faces. The CGI is pretty. The performances were entertaining enough. Ryan Reynolds is doing his same old thing. Mark Strong didn't appear so much which is disappointing but still he's awesome.It's disappointing because they're making the interesting villains into uninteresting. Example Parallax should be terrifying and menacing. Instead he's a scrambled egg who eats fear. Not really terrifying nor menacing. Peter Sarsgaard's mad scientist performance was pretty good but the only thing he did in this film is crying in agony and use his telekinesis powers in a lame way.Green Lantern just wanted to show its beautiful visuals. It's not a very bad thing but the filmmakers doesn't take its storytelling so seriously. It can be entertaining for some reason but it can also be forgettable. It's good to see it in the big screen for the visuals but you don't want to see it again after that. This might be the weakest superhero movie of the year. Even The Green Hornet is better than this. Thor might be the best superhero film of 2011 so far in my opinion because even though the action isn't great at least there is a compelling storytelling. The sad thing is both the action and the storytelling are not compelling in Green Lantern.3D? Very dark!".

Though I thoroughly disliked what the writers did to this movie I do hope the GL series isn't written off. There is still enough in the story of Green Lantern for a sequel but for the love of Oa the old script writers need to go and a brand new team needs to bring something to the table. Mark Strong is an acting powerhouse and as we have seen in the Dark Knight it is the villain and not the hero that makes an exceptional comic book movie! Sinestro has to do for GL what the Joker did for Batman! Thats my 2 cents".

	schema:reviewBody "Another in a long line of comic book films released this year Green Lantern unfortunately doesn't compare to Thor XMen First Class or Captain America. Had I seen Green Lantern before seeing those other three films perhaps I wouldn't be as critical of it. But those previous movies set a high standard that this latest comic book movie doesn't quite reach. I feel a large part of why GL isn't as successful as the films before it is the pace and editing. A film about aliens space police and a ring that can transform thought into reality should all come together to make one hell of an interesting film but somehow the movie suffers from a seemingly sluggish pace in the beginning thanks to a rather snoreworthy voiceover explaining things that we need to know before anything really interesting happens. Starting movies with prologuesexposition can be interesting but this one manages to make everything that should be interesting somehow dull. It's actually very disappointing given that director Martin Campbell was behind two of the best Bond movies ever Goldeneye and Casino Royale. Those films never had a dull moment in them whereas GL seems to have too many.I'm one who hadn't known the first thing about Green Lantern  having never read the comics  before seeing this movie. Having heard the name a while back I figured it was just some dude who liked the colour green and walked around with an oldtimey lantern. Luckily it's a bit more interesting than that. It actually involves a ring and a human Hal Jordan Ryan Reynolds who the ring chooses to join an intergalactic militarypolice force known as the Green Lantern Corps. Turns out I wasn't entirely wrong as there is indeed a lantern involved but thankfully it's not oldtimey and he doesn't just carry it around with him wherever he goes. Though he does swear an oath to it  one of the lighter moments in the film.Reynolds wasn't apparently many people's ideal actor to play Hal but I think he serves the role of the jetfightertestpilotturneduniverseprotector well. Yes he does play a bit of a jerk and he does have some funny lines but he's also believable in the more serious moments. When he recites the oath for the second time you know he's grown as a character. Reynolds is convincing in his portrayal of Hal's flaws as a person and by the end you're on his side.The lovely and very aptly named Blake Lively is a breath of fresh air livening things up and injecting some muchneeded energy into the otherwise kinda dull proceedings. As Carol Ferris she's not only a fellow pilot with Hal but also someone with whom Hal has a history. Not just another ordinaryboring love interest she's able to stand up to Hal not take his crap and can handle herself admirably. Best of all though? She's no idiot. Most awesomely Hal's lame Supermaninglasseslike attempt to cover up his identity with nothing more than a small green mask doesn't work on Carol. As she says she's known him her whole life and not being able to see his cheek bones isn't going to fool her. She immediately recognises it's him. Other superheroes' love interests would do well to learn from Carol take note Lois Lane!. The scene where he tries out his best Batman voice on her after having earlier rescued her in public from a crashing helicopter by creating a race track for it to land on is one of the best in the entire film. Carol's reactions to seeing through Hal's mask are really quite goodamusing. It's one of the more unique things about the film  where most tend to have the 'love interest' remain in the dark or look stupid for not having figured out things early on. I liked how Carol wasn't just giving Hal crap nonstop but also encouraged himsaved him. Lively and Reynolds have decent chemistry and share some good moments together. Though the restsupporting characters both human  alien are all rather average. This lack of character development lets the film down.It also doesn't help that the villains of the film are among some of the most nonscary  laughworthy villains ever to appear in comic book films up there with Green Goblin. Parallax is nothing more than a big angry dust cloud that zaps people with yellow. You know you're in trouble when this is the 'Big Bad' of the movie. The film's 'Little Bad' is hairsniffer Hector Hammond Peter Sarsgaard who becomes infected by Parallax and gains telepathictelekinetic abilities as a result...but also literally gets a big head  doesn't really seem like a fair tradeoff. Our fatheaded villain is gross to look at but other than that he's not particularly effective. He's just another poor sod with daddy issues and bad luck. He shares minimal dialogue with Hal and Carol and yet we're supposed to buy them as people who know each other well. The only real tense moment I felt involving them was was when Hector's threatening to make Carol like him  something no SANE person would want to see happen.What I felt really let the film down was the pacing. Things seem to be shown to us in a strange order a lot of the time and it just feels 'off'. I will say that the movie did allow for some interesting uses of CGI  the constructs Hal forms with his mindthe ring are pretty exciting  creative. The flying was also good. And it makes sense his costume looks the way it does since it's created out of energy.This isn't a bad film as such it just isn't all that it could have been. Still here's hoping that a sequel improves on it. Despite all the flaws I do wish to see Hal Jordan and Carrol Ferris again. Until then go green!".

	schema:headline " Lazy Writing Directing and Action Make This One to Avoid";
	schema:reviewBody "Back in 1977 when George Lucas told a story in the frame of Joseph Campbells Heroes Journey it was unique. When Sam Raimi told a super hero story with the same structure in 2002 there was still plenty it added a new filter. And when Jon Favreau did it again in 2008 he added enough unique touches to the tale to reinvigorate what was becoming a tired formula.The writers of Green Lantern felt it was enough to skim cliffnotes of Campbell and write the film based on their notes of the reading and half remembered recollections of reading comic books when they were 12. There is nothing new in this film. A man is given a magic ring which takes him out of the world of the ordinary and makes him a hero. We don't grow to care about him because he doesn't grow or change... he simply goes through the motions because the script tells him to.Ryan Reynolds tries his best with a weak and contrived script but he still comes off too snarky to be the overconfident jet pilot he's supposed to be. It's not all his fault as the script is much more content to tell us what the cast is feeling or thinking instead of letting the actors convey it through their actions inflections or looks. It is as if the writers had no faith in their cast or direction let alone their audience and dumbed the entire affair down below even the cartoon portrayals of the character.The visuals are nice but never have weight leading to the effect that Ryan Reynolds head if occasionally floating through a video game. It's sad to think it's been six years since Gollum and this is the best Warner Brothers can offer us in a tent pole film. It's also a shame to think this is the best they could do with only 37 million dollars less than Avatar. Again it just shows that the production staff was lazy never pushing it to look better and instead setting for the they'll think it looks cool effect.We should demand better from comic book films. After having Dark Knight and Iron Man in a single year we should not be subjected to subpar outings like this. Fun is one thing mind numbingly dumb and lazy is another.Skip this in the theater. Wait for it to come to NetFlix and then forget to put it in your cue. You'll thank me.".

When Sam Raimi told a super hero story with the same structure in 2002 there was still plenty it added a new filter. And when Jon Favreau did it again in 2008 he added enough unique touches to the tale to reinvigorate what was becoming a tired formula.The writers of Green Lantern felt it was enough to skim cliffnotes of Campbell and write the film based on their notes of the reading and half remembered recollections of reading comic books when they were 12. There is nothing new in this film. A man is given a magic ring which takes him out of the world of the ordinary and makes him a hero.

I wasn't really looking forward to this movie since every time I do I always got let down. My first thought after hearing Parallax being in the movie I was wondering if they would do it like in the comics. But that didn't make sense because this is only the first movie and the studio would make it as an origin movie not something else. The whole thing seemed a little tad slow and I think they tried to do character developments and get the story going but even for a fan I kind of found it hard to follow. It wasn't engaging enough I suppose. There were some action scenes but that also didn't really live up to expectations. I thought they had the right director and actors for this movie but something was missing from the comics. If they ever make a sequel to this movie I do hope they hire someone from DC to write a script and have the sort of impact Iron Man did back in 2008. I do have a feeling this is going to be another Superman Returns though.".

This is the problem with Green Lantern it's too predictable and does nothing new to make it stand out from the crowd. That's not necessarily a bad thing though but it's not a good thing either. There are 3 good things in this movie. One Peter Sarsgaard as Hector Hammond is delightfully hammy and fun to watch. Two the SFX are cool and what they do with the Green Lantern ring is also cool and Parallax's design suits its evilness. Third the fight between Hal and Parallax is the best scene in the movie. Other than those things it's average. If you've never seen a superhero movie andor are a Green Lantern fan this movie is worth seeing. Everyone else should see XMen First Class.".

I would have gone with an approach more like the DC animated cartoon Green Lantern First Flight. That would have appealed to a much wider audience.However I can assure you that if they make sequels this is a good starting point. Give the movie a chance see if you like the character I guarantee you Hal Jordan's stories only get better from here. Case in point Geoff Johns has won numerous awards for the comic book series Green Lantern.Anyway my opinion see the movie then watch Green Lantern First Flight. You will appreciate the movie much more that way.As a side note Green Lantern Emerald Knights is not really important to the general concept. It is more just background information on a few of the other lanterns and the only important segment you get the full story in Green Lantern First Flight.".

	schema:reviewBody "Comic book adaptations are quickly becoming one of the most popular movie genres of the modern era. With high speed action a good story and some great acting who could blame it. however there is one film that is constantly battered by fans and movie goers alike.Yes this is my review of Green Lantern.Note I do not believe in Millions of years so i'm just going to leave it out of this review. I ignore usually these kind of referencesThe plot goes like thisSomewhere in the universe a mighty force of nature called Parallax who feeds on the fear of the universe escapes custody by a green lantern warrior known as Abin Sur. Parallax fatally wounds Abin but he narrowly escapes instant death in an escape pod. He contacts the rest of the green lanterns and tells them who he encountered and that he will die. His pod lands on earth and at the brink of death he is met by a man who was brought there by his power ring. He passes on the ring to the man Hal Jordan and tells him to speak the oath. He does and becomes one of the green lanterns. It eventually falls on him to save the universe from Parallax and defeat him once and for all.While this movie doesn't live up to the standards of Captain America The First Avenger or the Nolan Batman Trilogy this film is still quite enjoyable.I'll admit the acting wasn't that great. There was no real character that stood out for me as being well acted but it was still watchable. As for the characters themselves they were quite interesting. Although the human characters were interesting to an extent It's the green lanterns that stole the show. Their is one scene were all the green lanterns are having a conference of some sort. There are so many green lanterns that sometimes all you see is green. Each one looks different and unique I actually pause at this part to see what other strange beings i missed inn the first viewing. Props to the designers for creating some brilliant looking creatures.The story isn't to special but it is interesting. It's nothing more than the normal superhero origin story with a couple of unorthodox plot lines. The movie's ending tells you that there is another movie coming. I won't spoil But green Lantern fans will like it If they didn't like the movie itself. The villain I thought is what brings the film down a notch. Halfway through the film a scientist gets infected by the power source of Parallax corrupting him into a monstrous creature that can control objects with his eyes. I wasn't too fond of the guy. His motives for his actions were uninteresting making some of the intence scenes a little tedious but this is a minor fault.Parallax is more impressive. There are some scenes were he is tearing through the city eating everything in his path. However like the other guy Who's name escapes me Parallax lacks motive for what he does other than the fact he needs fear to become more powerful.One of the most interesting things about the green lanterns is the power to make thought reality. For example you can think of a massive artillery gun and it would appear right beside you. This is an interesting concept and is far more diverse to other superheros. Although there are plenty of scenes of this power I thought it was under used Sometimes all they did was fire balls of green energy at their enemies which I thought was a waste. Don't let that put you off though. There are some impressive action scenes to sink your teeth into. The battle at the end with Parallax is definitely worth seeing. It didn't have as much action as i thought it would have or would have liked but it still was satisfying.All in all a great summer action flick. Not everyone's cup of tea but if you just like watching movies and are willing to bypass mistakes this is the film for you. With over use of CGI ad badly created villains it wasn't the best way to start a franchise but it is still enjoyable none the less.".

Personally i loved the film and hope that people will start to go to the movies without checking various reviews before hand. If you like Ryan Reynolds or if your a die hard Green Lantern Geoff Johns reader like myself you will love this movie. I gave it a 910. Very entertaining not over the top easy to follow great special effects and the usual occasional humor from Ryan Reynolds. Defiantly a great summer film. Critics are way to harsh on this film. Trust me give it a chance. According to rotten tomato Mr. Poppers Penguins is worth going to see over Green Lantern. Give me a break lol come on!!! Take your family to a great summer action film.

The cast is almost right though they should have used somebody more serious for the lead than Ryan Reynolds Sam Worthington perhaps. Blake Lively makes a sexy helpless heroine and Peter Sarsgaard does a fine job as a creepy bad guy albeit one covered in makeup. All in all this deserves to be up there with Superman II Dark Knight and the first two Spidermans. I really do hope they'll ignore the critics and box office revenue to make a second one as I feel one of the reasons its flopped is because many people who have watched it had never read the comic beforehand meaning it was harder to pick up some parts of the plot.".

I am so so so happy I did.DO NOT MISS THISON THE BIG SCREEN!!!!!!!Is Ryan Reynolds miscast? Yes but it doesn't matter he does a fine job. But it's the villains that you need to see this movie for Peter Saarsgard's performance is chilling repulsive scary and totally amazing. And that CGI baddie named Paralax is just as scary....but he's massive and he does a serious number on whatever city he was attacking.The offEarth scenes are great the CGIeffects are very good. And the characters like Kilowog and Sinestro are welldone. Bottom line if you're like me and you were letting the critics drive your decision to see this film...DON'T LET THEM. It's much better than they're giving it credit for. It's better than Thor and it's better than First Class. Looking forward to Captain America!!!!".

Interrupting his plans is his nephew Lionel Jason Ritter who knocks on his door at the propitious moment carrying his script about Benjamin Disraeli and looking for Uncle Charlie's help in Hollywood. Ignoring the script Charlie returns to his morbid task only to spot an article about a blockbuster actionhero movie star L.L. Cool J who has recently converted to Judaism and is looking for a Jewish film for his next project. Seeing a glimmer of hope Charlie hatches an outrageous seatofyourpants scheme to coerce a studio into approving this preposterous pairing. Assigned to the project is Diedre Hearn a secondtier studio exec played by Meg Ryan still trying to transition from her girlnextdoor pedigree. Charlie is smitten and resurrected Ben Disraeli  Freedom Fighter gets greenlighted and the fun begins. There's even a role for Elliott Gould playing a rabbi who serves as a technical adviser and Assistant Producer to the film! I guess Macy decided that at 57 if he was ever going to play a leading man he was going to have to personally drive the project. And he has written himself a plum rolea multidimensional character with a lot of funny lines and Meg Ryan as a love interest! Charlie Berns has suffered all the indignities that Hollywood can dish out. But he's learned enough tricks and developed enough chutzpah that with a little luck he can really work the system. Macy plays the role with unflappable charm and impeccable comic timing.The script bounces around a bit and probably bounces a couple of times too many. The resolution feels a little like an addon and perhaps could have been left out. So while I doubt this movie will do great things at the box office it certainly entertained the Sundance crowd.Sundance Moment Macy told the long story of how difficult it was to get the project funded which is a recurring Sundance and Hollywood theme.

This is of course not surprising since the film is hugely fun mixing JudaismIsraeli aspects into a wonderful satire of Hollywood filmdom. Don't take this film too seriously although the acting is wonderful with everyone clearly knowing it's all in fun. Despite that I really got into the 'vibe' of the story waiting to see whether they'd manage to finish making the film  whichever one it'll be. The whole Jewish angle of the film is of course especially fun for us here in Israel and even more so because Israeli actor Sharon Reginiano plays Levy the director and inserts all sorts of comments in Hebrew which may be lost to nonHebrew speakers even if they are translated. The film reminded me very much of The Hebrew Hammer 2003 with Adam Goldberg which I saw at the JFF of that year. Both films use the JewishIsraeliHebrew slants to the max and are extremely tongueincheek satirizing their respective genres. Don't overanalyze or dissect this film  just see it for what it is a fun satire of Hollywood moviemaking and all it involves. Don't know if this'll catch on in the overall USworldwide markets but we here sure enjoyed it. And if it does go straight to DVD no matter  just enjoy it that way!".

The Deal was a few cameos short of brilliant and a bit light on the darker sides. Macy was great as usual when is not. I feel Macy's character had to be more depressed and a little more crazy and the film needed more of The Player and less Bowfinger. Satire is not laugh out loud comedy it is often just relief that you are finally watching something good. This film would have been a very hard sell with a smaller budget than Bill and Ben and I'm sure Ryan was working for free or being blackmailed into making the film. This being said they had very good chemistry although anyone could with Macy he is probably the best actor working in Americaperiod!!!!! This film type is now a genre with Entourage and Tropic Thunder etc... It is a great shame this film suffers from what is exactly this film is aboutthe B.S in Hollywood the outdoor luney bin!!!

	schema:reviewBody "From a business perspective in some ways I can understand why this movie is going direct from the film festivals straight to DVD.

Macy has a commanding comedic touch he nurtured in Fargo and adds a sprinkle of tragedy he borrows from The Cooler.

	schema:reviewBody "In the tradition of Blake Edwards' SOBin the 1980s and Tim Robbins' The Player in the 90s now comes William H. Macy's 2008 Hollywood sendup set piece The Deal. Despite being saddled with a washed out and forgettable title this gem is so loaded with wit and sidelong winks you can overlook the mistakes the marketing mavens made  such as deciding not to promote this film's theatrical release. Like Meg Ryan's character Deidre says as the moviewithinamovie wraps Even if this goes straight to video it was worth it. That's for sure.Macy who cowrote the screenplayreserves the film's most memorable lines for his character the selfdestructive schnook with courage and heart of the MGM lion. Hey we're in the entertainment business right? So I'm entertaining myself! The Jewish riff is done to a T...as in Tallit and T'fillin. Watching LL Cool J with a yarmulke on his dorag spouting Yiddish as he rescues a Torah from an exploding temple caused me to pish myself. The film is populated with the expected coterie of Hollywood archetypes and stereotypes The elder actor who can't remember lines the prima dona director the country club Rabbi the cutthroat suits agents and assorted debauched denizens of the film industry. Macy delights in skewering them without a shred of nastiness.The cast is well directed and in top form. No one phoned in a performance on this set. Even Meg Ryan seems to recapture some of her youthful ingenueishness making the quirky romance between her character and Macy's totally convincing. Elliot Gould's turn as the Associate Producer  Rabbi is as tasty as cream cheese on a toasted bagel.I haven't laughed out loud this much at a screening since The Loved One and that's been a really long time.As they say You don't have to be Jewish to enjoy The Deal but it doesn't hurt.".

	onyx:emotionText "In the tradition of Blake Edwards' SOBin the 1980s and Tim Robbins' The Player in the 90s now comes William H. Macy's 2008 Hollywood sendup set piece The Deal. Despite being saddled with a washed out and forgettable title this gem is so loaded with wit and sidelong winks you can overlook the mistakes the marketing mavens made  such as deciding not to promote this film's theatrical release. Like Meg Ryan's character Deidre says as the moviewithinamovie wraps Even if this goes straight to video it was worth it. That's for sure.Macy who cowrote the screenplayreserves the film's most memorable lines for his character the selfdestructive schnook with courage and heart of the MGM lion. Hey we're in the entertainment business right? So I'm entertaining myself! The Jewish riff is done to a T...as in Tallit and T'fillin. Watching LL Cool J with a yarmulke on his dorag spouting Yiddish as he rescues a Torah from an exploding temple caused me to pish myself. The film is populated with the expected coterie of Hollywood archetypes and stereotypes The elder actor who can't remember lines the prima dona director the country club Rabbi the cutthroat suits agents and assorted debauched denizens of the film industry. Macy delights in skewering them without a shred of nastiness.The cast is well directed and in top form. No one phoned in a performance on this set. Even Meg Ryan seems to recapture some of her youthful ingenueishness making the quirky romance between her character and Macy's totally convincing. Elliot Gould's turn as the Associate Producer  Rabbi is as tasty as cream cheese on a toasted bagel.I haven't laughed out loud this much at a screening since The Loved One and that's been a really long time.As they say You don't have to be Jewish to enjoy The Deal but it doesn't hurt.";

There is not remotely a believable moving or memorable moment to save this unfunny comedy. Macy usually provides some human warmth to his characters but even he could not save this terrible script. Macy's relationship with Ryan is not touching and the two have no chemistry whatsoever. Also Meg Ryan who was never good looking to begin with now looks like a freak gross! Grade F".

The arc in his character is so clear and obvious that it is easy yet enjoyable to go on the journey with his character. The movie's satirical view on Hollywood filmmaking is sure to make anyone laugh. The direction is clear and the movie is fastpaced yet easy to follow. Honestly it took me by surprise. I didn't really know what to expect when I watched it and was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. I also loved Jason Ritter's performance...this movie deserves some recognition. It's stacked with amazing talent. The beginning of the movie is done very well drawing the audience into the piece. I HIGHLY recommend it!".

His nephew Jason Ritter gives him his script about Benjamin Disraeli to read. He's not interested in it but then he sees an article about a major star in adventure films Bobby Mason LL Cool J who has converted to Judaism and wants to do a film with a Jewish theme for his next project.Charlie manages to convince a studio that he has Bobby Mason's next kick your butt film and a studio executive Deidre Meg Ryan is assigned to make it happen. Soon Bill  Ben is being filmed with Berns' heartbroken nephew screaming There's not one word of my script in this. Then Bobby Mason is kidnapped and held for ransom and the studio doesn't want to pay. But Deidre has an idea.We've seen these behind the scenes getting a movie made before and this is absurd but quite good. And how absurd is it? Probably not far off. Macy is excellent as Berns who has been around the block a few times and knows how to talk his way into and out of trouble. This movie took a while to get made so there's no doubt Macy knew what he was talking about when he wrote the script  I'm sure it wasn't a new experience for him.Ryan's role could have been played by anyone but at 47 and once the ingnue du jour as Rene Zwelleger Reese Witherspoon Julia Roberts Susan Sarandon and Sally Field once were she has a problem. While leading men are leading men from the time they're in their twenties until death pert pretty young actresses have a limited shelf life and the transition to lead woman not only is difficult it's often not even worth it since that doesn't last long either. Today things are much better  at least 30 is no longer the cutoff like it was in Bette Davis' day  but the fact remains unless your name is Meryl Streep you'll be in character roles by the time you're 55. If you have a job. So I can't blame her for doing this role.Good enjoyable movie especially if you're a writer and know what happens to scripts in Hollywood.".

	schema:reviewBody "William H. Macy has given a lot of great performances in a lot of great films. Absolutely none of that is apparent in this unfunny selfabsorbed toothless and tiresome movie. The Deal makes Macy look like some talentless boob who won the lottery and decided to leave his job as an accountant and become a filmmaker. Teamed up with a starkly unattractive Meg Ryan Macy has created a gigantic turd that should have been left in his toilet bowl and not flung at the public like an angry chimp.The Deal is yet another entry into one of the most putrid genres of modern cinema the movie about making movies. It seems as though virtually every single person in Hollywood wants to make one of these films and virtually all of them suck ass. Even the best of these movies about movies are rarely more than inside jokes that most people don't get. Most of them are boring and selfindulgent. The worst are physically painful to sit through.Charlie Berns William H. Macy is a movie producer so down on his luck he's about to kill himself. Unfortunately for the people watching The Deal Charlie's suicide is interrupted by his nephew Lionel Jason Ritter who has a script about Benjamin Disraeli and William Gladstone that he wants Charlie to look at. In the first of many things in this story that make little to no sense the script inspires Charlie to try and put together a deal to produce a 100 million dollar action flick starring megastar Bobby Mason LL Cool J. Though he encounters some resistance from studio executive Deirdre Hearn Meg Ryan Charlie is able to pile up enough BS to get the project approved and rushed into production.As filming begins it becomes obvious that the movie is going to be a spectacular piece of garbage. Charlie however can only focus on trying to get into Deirdre's pants. When Bobby Mason is kidnapped by terrorists and the studio shuts down production Deirdre and Charlie decide to take the leftover money and make a movie out of Lionel's original script which had been bastardized beyond recognition to suit the meatheaded Mason's limitations. Can Deirdre and Charlie get this charming and classy film made before the studio figures out what they're up to?I can honestly say that I didn't care a whit about anything or anyone in this story. I didn't care if they made the first crappy film or the second quality film. I didn't care if Charlie and Deirdre got together. I didn't care about them when they got together. And after they inevitably broke up I didn't care if they got back together. I didn't care if Charlie had a hundred lit bottle rockets shoved up his butt. I didn't care if Deirdre was gang raped by a herd of rhinos. The characters in this film are neither real nor amusing. The plot is schizophrenic. The direction is pedestrian in the sense it tried to cross the street and got run over by a truck. The dialog is stunningly unfunny and most of the acting especially by the two leads is the sort of stuff that wouldn't even pass muster at a community theater in a small town of 200 people.Macy seems to have tried to get through his entire performance using only two expressions. I wouldn't be surprised if I found out Meg Ryan was drunk in half her scenes. And in addition to her poor acting Ryan just looks awful in this film. I don't know if it was bad make up whatever she's done to her lips or if she's just been too thin for too long but Ryan appears to have been ridden hard and put away wet. Ryan was a marvelously cute woman and had the sort of attractiveness that should have aged well. In The Deal she only looks aged.Let me give you a specific example of how terrible this movie is. After Charlie and Deirdre have their predictable onset fling it's just as predictable they break up when filming is over. But things go past predictable and into lobotomized when Charlie and Deirdre have not one not two but three goodbye scenes one right after the other right after the other. Imagine if at the end of Star Wars that after the ceremony where Han and Luke received their medals they held a second ceremony and gave them another pair of medals. That's what the ending of The Deal is like.I didn't get a single moment or ounce of entertainment out of watching this film. If you want to see William H. Macy's bare behind it does make two very brief appearances. Beyond that you'd get more out of a screenful of static than you will out of viewing The Deal.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wow. This is tiresome.It's boring and pointless and there is absolutely no humor.Obviously this movie is made for Jewish people who work in and around Hollywood or New York and not for anybody from another culture.This is insulting to anybody who is not Jewish.There is endless yapping love scenes which spring out of nowhere and a plot that also goes nowhere  because it appears from nowhere.I have nothing against any religion or nationality but this just sucks.It's not only insulting to anybody who is Jewish  but also to anybody who isn't Jewish.Basically it's insulting to everybody.The only people who can appreciate this on any level are the people that worked on the film in any capacity because there is nothing else to enjoy. They made a few more connections they made a paycheck some got to travel and they get credit for something that is listed on IMDB  another notch only not of anything of interest.This was compared to Bowfinger  which in no way should it be.Bowfinger is in no way any comparison.Bowfinger is actually funny and has a plot which can relate to almost anybody  in Hollywood or not  and it doesn't segregate any religions or nations. The entire story of Bowfinger is a laugh from the first minute to the last  and it makes sense  even to 10 year old kids.This is straight garbage  and as good as the people played their parts they still were bad because the story was bad  except for some few Jewish people who work in the film industry. They will find this intriquing for some mysterious reason.The high rating system on here is constructed of the people involved in this mess because nobody else on the planet would find it funny  even in a dark humorous sense. There is no comedy or dramedy  there is only tiresome boring nothingness compounded with endless chatter about faith of some religion.If this was made by Catholics  it would suck if this was made by Buddhists or Hindus Islams Baptists or Lutherans or any other religious sect on the planet  regardless which one chosen  it would still suck.This was made by Jewish Hollywood business people for a very small group of Jewish Hollywood business people about a very small group of Hollywood business people and it employed a majority of Jewish Hollywood business people.This is more racist than almost any other film I've ever seen  and it doesn't even entertain in any capacity. Even if I was Jewish  it would bore me  because it just sucks!I don't have to be Jewish or understand the religion in any capacity to realize there is nothing here. There's a story which is about 1 hour and 40 minutes long and it's just a dreadful bore to sit through  and not even as entertaining as this review.Any other Jewish people will be lost on this if they have no connection with any high sections of movie making. Even if they worked in the production office or accounting or as a crew member they won't get the story  because it lost it's focus after 3 minutes of starting.Congratulations if you are 1 of 3000 people that watched this film and understood it in any capacity. You are the rare and limited audience that this went for and somehow magically succeeded.As horrid as this was I'm glad it was made  not because it shows promise  but because it shows none. Which means  the executives in Hollywood really have no clue as to what they are signing on for but if it includes Jewish themes  they hope to save their hides.This will not be viewed by majority of people  but the amount of money that was spent on this could have made 10 decent budget films which would actually be enjoyed and viewed by millions  but surprisingly bankers producers distributors and financiers decided to put out this crap in hopes of somehow getting a kickback or some sort of payoff further down the line.Dreadful on so many levels. Regardless of race this is just a stinker with no redeeming quality.It's also super racist in it's very own way.".

	onyx:emotionText "Wow. This is tiresome.It's boring and pointless and there is absolutely no humor.Obviously this movie is made for Jewish people who work in and around Hollywood or New York and not for anybody from another culture.This is insulting to anybody who is not Jewish.There is endless yapping love scenes which spring out of nowhere and a plot that also goes nowhere  because it appears from nowhere.I have nothing against any religion or nationality but this just sucks.It's not only insulting to anybody who is Jewish  but also to anybody who isn't Jewish.Basically it's insulting to everybody.The only people who can appreciate this on any level are the people that worked on the film in any capacity because there is nothing else to enjoy. They made a few more connections they made a paycheck some got to travel and they get credit for something that is listed on IMDB  another notch only not of anything of interest.This was compared to Bowfinger  which in no way should it be.Bowfinger is in no way any comparison.Bowfinger is actually funny and has a plot which can relate to almost anybody  in Hollywood or not  and it doesn't segregate any religions or nations. The entire story of Bowfinger is a laugh from the first minute to the last  and it makes sense  even to 10 year old kids.This is straight garbage  and as good as the people played their parts they still were bad because the story was bad  except for some few Jewish people who work in the film industry. They will find this intriquing for some mysterious reason.The high rating system on here is constructed of the people involved in this mess because nobody else on the planet would find it funny  even in a dark humorous sense. There is no comedy or dramedy  there is only tiresome boring nothingness compounded with endless chatter about faith of some religion.If this was made by Catholics  it would suck if this was made by Buddhists or Hindus Islams Baptists or Lutherans or any other religious sect on the planet  regardless which one chosen  it would still suck.This was made by Jewish Hollywood business people for a very small group of Jewish Hollywood business people about a very small group of Hollywood business people and it employed a majority of Jewish Hollywood business people.This is more racist than almost any other film I've ever seen  and it doesn't even entertain in any capacity. Even if I was Jewish  it would bore me  because it just sucks!I don't have to be Jewish or understand the religion in any capacity to realize there is nothing here. There's a story which is about 1 hour and 40 minutes long and it's just a dreadful bore to sit through  and not even as entertaining as this review.Any other Jewish people will be lost on this if they have no connection with any high sections of movie making.

Fortunately a hot star of the genre LL Cool J has just converted to Judaism! Thus the movie will be titled Benjamin Disraeli freedom fighter and set in South Africa.

Throwing caution to the wind Charlie and Deirdre decide to make the film the writer penned in the first place. They just won't tell the studio! This is a zany film which moves very fast.

	schema:reviewBody "Cowritten by William H. Macy and Steven Schachter this movie named The Deal was directed by Schacher and starred Macy as Charlie Berns Meg Ryan as Deidre Hearn and Jason Ritter as Lionel Travitz. It's a laughoutloud funny movie but it has a few minor faults.The gist of the movie is that Charlie is a hasbeen producer who has hit the end of the line. His nephew Lionel stumbles in with a script. Charlie having nothing to lose pitches it to a studio as a vehicle for a black action star who has recently converted to Judaism and is looking for a property to promote his new Jewish ideals. The only problem is that the script is about Benjamin Disraeli an 1800s English prime minister. Disraeli was born into a Jewish family but his father had him baptized as an Anglican when Disraeli was twelve.Spoilers ahead. Here is one of my problems. Although Charlie is pitched by the script as a total loser he outmaneuvers everyone with aplomb and total lack of effort and gets the film green lighted. He then finesses and finagles every problem thrown at him by Diedre who loves the original script and detests the rewrite as an action film with Disraeli as a black action hero machinegunning Muslims to save a Torah and the girl. The process in The Deal is hilarious I just had to suspend a wee bit too much disbelief. The script is based on Peter Lefcourt's novel of the same name and a great deal of the film is spent skewering Hollywood types. Charlie sloughs off all responsibility dumping all decisions on others in his relentless drive to get the film in the can. Roadblock after roadblock from selfpromoting producers legal development prima donna directors prima donna actors and studio heads are overcome or bypassed with a casual toss of the hand by Charlie. It was funny very funny but just not quite believable to me.The other problem is that the screenplay bolts a romantic comedy onto the darker comedy about Hollywood types. Meg Ryan's Diedre is in development and she wants the original script produced. She attempts to hijack the movie sabotage it and get it back on track in the process falling in love with Charlie. My major problem is that Charlie shown as an unkempt total loser with no class never really cleans up even when he's winning. In Pretty Woman Julia Roberts plays a street walker for pete's sake not even a call girl but when Richard Gere gets her out of her slutty costume she gets class.Charlie alas remains unclassy throughout. I guess my major complaint is that while Meg Ryan can do a respectable Myrna Loy William H. Macy is no William Powell. Ever. Nothing in the script makes him bloom into a character worth Diedre's time. Macy has a winning smile and the script has him playing it for all it's worth but he's not my ideal romantic lead opposite Meg Ryan. The parts of the script where Charlie and Diedre bantered back and forth didn't sparkle for me.The movie hit the indie film contests and went straight to video. I enjoyed the movie a great deal despite its flaws and I recommend it.I read the novel after I saw the movie. I recommend this because most books have depth and character missing from movies but it's not necessary for Lefcourt's book. The book and movie are different enough to keep your interest but there's no character development and no depth  like the movie not a problem. It's a funny book but I suspect I missed a lot of inside humor since I don't know the goings on in Hollywood. The book was published in 1991 and it's dated because of references to the top stars of 20 years ago but most people will catch the drift. Additionally the relationship between Diedre and Charlie is more fully developed has a satisfactory explanation and suffers no attempts at romantic banter. With no description of Charlie offered by Lefcourt he's left to my own imagination.One other plus for the book I got a lot more out of the names for Lefcourt's characters. Emprin Hudris Fuchs Ikon Bland Auger and more I'm sure that went right over my head. It got off to a very slow start but it soon had me turning pages with time going by unnoticed.".

Yes admittedly the plot is not original the screenplay is truly bythenumbers and the acting is generally amateurish.  Yet in spite of these shortcomings the movie is still catchy sincere and engrossing.  That's because of the talented stars who really love what they do namely breakdancing and poppin' and lockin' along with the stimulating getonyourfeet dance music.This movie is like a time capsule of the 80s with hints of the future. Moreover I still find it to be inspirational motivational and hypnotic. Looking at these streetdancers and the jazz dancer go after their dreams with sheer determination talent and grit makes me want to jump up and do the same thing!  Yes I'm nearly fifty but looking at this movie gave me another shot of adrenalin to do what I need to do in my daily life. Ain't no stoppin' us is the endless musical mantra in Breakin'...nothing stopped the dancers and nothing's going to stop me either.

	schema:headline " What happens when street dancing is mixed with theater dancing?";
	schema:reviewBody "Breakin was the west coast version of Beat Street. Breakin came complete with poplocking break dancing battling trash talking rapping and oh yeah... terrible outfits all of the elements that made the 80's endearing to some and loathsome to others. Unlike Beat Street Breakin' explored what would happen when street dancing actually mixed with traditional theaterstage dancing. Break dancers Ozone Adolfo Quinones and Turbo Michael Chambers are regular urban street dancers just practicing for the next battle until they meet Kelly Lucinda Dickey a performing arts dancer. What happens when street dancing mixes with performing arts dancing? This is where the separation occurs between the purists on either side and the nonpurists. The purists for both street dancing and performing arts dancing abhorred the adulteration of their style of dance where as the nonpurists adored the mixing of the two. Personally to this day I can't decide which side of the fence I'm on. But either way I was entertained. I've liked this movie for years and will always like it for the sheer entertainment value. The acting wasn't that great nor was the script and the story wasn't much better but they kept everything simple enough where it wouldn't draw too many jeers and then there was dancin' and battlin'.

	onyx:emotionText "Breakin was the west coast version of Beat Street. Breakin came complete with poplocking break dancing battling trash talking rapping and oh yeah... terrible outfits all of the elements that made the 80's endearing to some and loathsome to others. Unlike Beat Street Breakin' explored what would happen when street dancing actually mixed with traditional theaterstage dancing. Break dancers Ozone Adolfo Quinones and Turbo Michael Chambers are regular urban street dancers just practicing for the next battle until they meet Kelly Lucinda Dickey a performing arts dancer. What happens when street dancing mixes with performing arts dancing? This is where the separation occurs between the purists on either side and the nonpurists. The purists for both street dancing and performing arts dancing abhorred the adulteration of their style of dance where as the nonpurists adored the mixing of the two.

Lucinda Dickey plays our white suburban tour guide to the inner city as a jazz dancer who falls in love with street dancing  and possibly a black man though the movie is so coy about the interracial relationship romance that it is only ever implied  even through the film's sequel  that there is any attraction whatsoever between the two. While the cheese never stops flowing and it would be a lot of fun for no other reason the dance sequences are actually very impressive. Boogaloo Shrimp is particularly great in his dance with the broom even though I can see the strings attached to it. The film also features Ice T some eight years before he penned Cop Killas and apparently JeanClaude Van Damme though I missed him. Lucinda Dickey starred in one of my other favorite cult classics in the same year Ninja III The Domination.".

Sure sure at first you're overwhelmed by the moves the music the clothes and JeanClaude Van Damme.What? JeanClaude Van Damme????? What the hell was that? It was only my third consecutive viewing that revealed his presence in the first Venice Beach scene. Needless to say I laughed my proverbial ass off. I thought this was the gayest movie ever before noticing JeanClaude!!! Now? Now I'm convinced! This is the GAYEST movie ever!!! But in a really good fun innocent way know what I mean? I think that pretty much encapsulates the pop culture of the time. The movie is pure unintentional comedy the best kind of comedy in my humble opinion. The dialog is cheesy the acting cheesier but the dancing is hype. That's what really got me. Turbo is amazing. His body is a living rubberband or was anyway. A fun game to play during the film is would you wear that outfit in public if someone paid you fifty bucks every time you wore it? The amount can be interchanged with a larger or smaller sum depending on the ridiculousness of the ensemble in question. My final conclusion? I would wear the outfit Ozone sports to the winesniffing party for 200.00 a day. I mean the hat is ridiculous but fourteen hundred dollars a week? It's not that ridiculous.".

This movie was filmed back to back with Breakin' 2 The Electric Boogaloo. In the very beginning of the film you can spot future stars Lela Rochon and JeanClaude Van Damme. Teresa Laughlin Billy Jack series has a small part in the first scene as Kelly's friend.Recommended for 80's nostalgia fans and Lucinda Dickey admirers.B".

In many of my other reviews I come down hard for ridiculous plot lines and lack of believability but this flick was never intended to be taken seriously on any level. It is a comical take on actionspy movies and so it matters not what liberties are taken.If you enjoy Bruce Willis being Bruce Willis you like nonstop action and you are in the mood for some mindless entertainment it is worth a watch. No thinking required.Personally I enjoyed the original Red and I like watching the old codgers play it up on the action scene. Yes Helen Mirren is certainly getting old but she still exudes sex appeal which has little to do with age or looks and she is amazingly credible as an action hero. I'd love to see her star in some serious actionspy films.Malkovich is his usual self and plays a small uninspired role. The surprise for me was Anthony Hopkins. He didn't have too much to do here but more than I thought. He could have fluffed his way through a film like this but he took the role as seriously as any other and his performance enhanced the film.The humor in this one is not side splitting but it works. They could have hit us over the head with tired oldtimer gags but they were smart and didn't really go that route in this sequel. Overall I have seen far far worse in this genre.Just remember this is an overthetop kind of movie. It's not even close to a typical action comedy. This one has more unbelievable fights gunfire chases and general absurdities than five garden variety action flicks combined. I usually don't like superaction movies with nothing but explosions and bullets every two seconds but in this film the action works and the light comedy keeps pace with it.Watch Red 2 when you want to shut down your brain for a little while and relax with some good old American explosive violent unapologetic savetheworld comedic entertainment.".

It's not as if this is lazy yes it's still Frank and his aged assassins fighting old age as well as an outside threat but there's a flipflop in plotting and the additions of Anthony Hopkins Byunghun Lee and Catherine ZetaJones are most welcome. It's also so nice to see the adorable MaryLouise Parker get a substantial part this go around while Helen Mirren still sexy and gorgeous in her late 60s is delightfully sociopathic! Red 2 is full to the brim with acting talent who are in on the fun joke of it all. Action is never in short supply and the pace is never allowed to sag by director Dean Parisot. The characters remain strong thanks to the screenplay Jon and Erich Hoeber and the airy humour is consistent and keeps the violence grounded. Basically this is a hugely enjoyable ball of action based froth. 710".

It's not easy to have all the killings and explosions happening and yet maintaining a light hearted and fun tone. Red 2 succeeds again in reaching the balance making it enjoyable and fun. There are many cool scenes such as Helen Mirren firing guns with both hands towards opposite directions from a car. Mary Louise Parker's character is also fun she seems not to know how to do anything but she is still so cool and funny. It's nice to see an action film having a big female presence it's such a pleasant change. All the characters I enjoyed watching Red 2 and maybe there will be another sequel?".

The story is very simple and straight forward but a star studded cast that includes Bruce Willis John Malcovich Helen Mirren and Anthony Hopkins make this a very enjoyable two hours. I did feel the story was really lacking in depth it just seems to move along piece by piece no moment is really significant or gratifying for the audience it never tried to make this sequel stand out on its own. I did not enjoy the love issues which erupt between Frank and Sarah as a result of Catherine ZetaJones' character it all felt very forced and created an annoying persona for Mary Louise Parker making her nowhere near as cool as or likable as she was in the original she was a strong character then here she is simply a love interest. It certainly has its flaws but Red 2 mostly makes up for it with its pure fun and optimistic cast I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good action or comedy. A retired secret agent and his girlfriend get dragged in to a race to find a nuclear bomb. Best Performance Anthony Hopkins".

You are checking out RED2 because you are expecting something akin to RED1. Foolish viewer. You have fallen into the most common trap that viewers are snared by these days. You have assumed that Hollywood works in a logical manner and sequels are extensions of what went before. Wrong. Hollywood historians of the future will note is a giant cash flow machine run by individuals so wealthy that more often that not they will tinker and toy with the workings of the machine just to make themselves feel more important than they actually are. This deep dark secret is the key to why so many sequels bare so little resemblance to the films that started the franchise. Another analogy would be a xerox of a xerox of a xerox. By the time you get to the 3rd xerox usually made in some obscure place like Canada for 13 the budget of the original  and it shows  any similarity to the original is merely coincidental. Which brings us to Red2. Red1 was a clever action film built on a great premise that worked especially well because of our familiarity with talent. Familiar talent. Old friend talent. Talent that releases happy juice  serotonin  in the brain when we watch. Red2 aside from being overlong inconsistent and based on the wacky ensemble comedies of the 60s along the lines of ITS A MAD MAD MAD WORLD  is a comedy with occasional moments of action. Big difference. The real surprise in the film and a pleasant one at that is Mary Louise Parker the only actor in the project who looks like she is having fun and the actor who consistently steals scene after scene from much more seasoned names. As she ages and she ages well she is developing cartoon eyes and she uses these time and again in the film to salvage scenes which otherwise would not be funny at all. There are so many things wrong here I would exceed the IMDb word limit if I listed them all. Here is just a friendly tip to the producers if they ever try anything like this again. When you are casting a Russian agent ZetaJones in Red2 it would be surprisingly useful to find someone that can actually do a Russian accent. Only for the terminally bored or fans of Ms. Parker.".

	schema:reviewBody "Frank Bruce Willis and Sarah MaryLouise Parker are just trying to lead ordinary lives when Marvin John Malkovich appears out of nowhere and is subsequently killed right in front of them. After the funeral Frank is arrested and taken to a facility to be interrogated about a topsecret project he supposedly had knowledge of in his former capacity as a CIA agent. Unfortunately while being interrogated a group of trained assassins break in with the intent to kill him. He manages to escape and this results in a race by certain governments to either kill him to contain the information or to capture him in order to acquire the information. Now although this film wasn't necessarily bad I personally believe that it failed to live up to the hype and the level of the first movie. For starters there were too many characters thrown in with not enough film to go around for all of them. That said I liked the addition of both Catherine ZetaJones as Katja and Anthony Hopkins Dr. Bailey Evans. But Byunghun Lee as Han Cho Bai wasn't needed and his performance was too clichd and unpolished. Likewise the reintroduction of Victoria Helen Mirren and Ivan Brian Cox was too obvious and clumsy. Further the main characters who made the last film a success weren't given the material that played up to their strengths. For example Frank wasn't the baddest character on the blockHan Cho Bai wasand it diminished Frank's status somewhat. Likewise Marvin wasn't nearly as crazy or funny and Sarah seemed to lose the two things that made her special in the first film her innocence and vulnerability. So essentially what we had was a collection of characters thrown against the wall to see which ones would stick. And some things just didn't seem to work. In short it wasn't as good as the first movie. I rate this movie as average.".

While Bruce Willis John Malkovich and Helen Mirren are all back as retired secret agents on the run the film lacks the wit and charm of its predecessor. Not to mention the fact that the plot makes little to no sense is bloated with too many underdeveloped characters and therefore I just don't care. Honestly this is the first movie in a long time that I seriously thought about leaving the theater after about midway through. The only shining light is Anthony Hopkins as a deranged mad scientist other than that Red 2 is a complete misfire.I give Red 2 a 4 out of 10!".

Along with them there ate newcomers Catherine ZetaJones Byunghun Lee and Anthony Hopkins. The cast really has great chemistry and John Malkovich really delivers particularly in his comedy.Red 2 shines in its action comedy and acting. The best part about Red 2 is how it further develops these characters and has fun while doing so.The bottom line is watch this movie if your a fan of the first film or have any interest in it as its one fun ride that leaves you satisfied and excited for the next chapter. 1010".

In addition if you're not able to take an action packed comedy sequels filled with humor than ignore this review as well. We'll both be better off.Red 2 2013 in my opinion is a good movie as the first one but I still prefer the first movie better than this. The first time I saw it I thought it was okay. But than again watching both movies separately on Bluray I realized I love the first one much better than this one. I like this movie not love just like. But the things that bothered me was this movie was time by time boring unlike the first one. I just got really tired and bored watching it for 2.hrs. You have now a new additions on the cast Anthony Hopkins Catherine ZetaJones Byung Hun Lee  Neal McDonough and director Robert Schwentke was replaced by new director Dean Parisot. Karl Urban was replaced by Byung Hun Lee who played Storm Shadow in both G.I. Joe flicks. I was little upset that Karl Urban was replaced and he wasn't in this movie. Still I think Byung Hun Lee did an excellent job in this movie. Everyone in this movie does a great job.John Malkovich did an outstanding job playing repressing his role back again as Marvin Boggs and the were full of laughs in it. The story was great and the action was good. I still love the new characters in this Anthony Hopkins as two face person did a convincing job and believable acting I seriously love the twist on the end of the movie. Anthony Hopkins Is amazing in this film the role is perfect and the accent just makes it so awesome the most bad ass villain ever. The humor in this movie is good the face off between good and evil is good. The story works and you keep guessing what will be next. MaryLouise Parker as Sarah Ross is even more hotter than she was in the first movie and a little more sexy than ever. She is gorgeous and does a lot of spy stuff in here she is like Lucy she wants to do everything in this movie. The movie is really funny and entertaining. I know a lot of people prefer this one over the first one even my friend told me this one is better. I will still stay by my own opinion and I will always enjoy Red more than Red 2 sorry fans. It is an entertaining movie Catherine Zeta Jones character was flat but it served the B story. MirrenCox couple was down right cute John Malkovich was hilarious again MaryLouise Parker great learning the spy trade was slap stick funny Byunghun Lee did a good job at being the serious funny and Anthony Hopkins is always good. the action was believable good the spy stuff was believable good and the chemistry worked.In RED 2 the highoctane actioncomedy sequel to the worldwide sleeper hit retired blackops CIA agent Frank Moses reunites his unlikely team of elite operatives for a global quest to track down a missing portable nuclear device. To succeed they' will need to survive an army of relentless assassins ruthless terrorists and powercrazed government officials all eager to get their hands on the nextgeneration weapon. The mission takes Frank and his motley crew to Paris London and Moscow. Outgunned and outmanned they have only their cunning wits their oldschool skills and each other to rely on as they try to save the worldand stay alive in the process. It is still good movie not the best or that great but still good full action packed enjoyable flick to watch! Overall It is a good action packed fun excellent movie with the twists around great action scenes great cast and just great acting. The Acting in this movie is very realistic and outstanding performed from all the actors in here. I like how different these action movies are  they are cheesy but also have some brains to the plot and the characters  Bruce Willis being one of my favorites  I always liked the concept of old veteran people still teaching the young bunch how its done. Red 2 is as good as the first one with it's original cast returning again and kicking ass all over the place just without Morgan Freeman and my favorite all time actor Karl Urban! Red 2 is the same level as Red 1 but still good one it is a good time it does kind a little drag one this one does feel a bit longer than the first one but still good. I am giving it a 9 which is A for me because there wasn't Karl Urban in it. Red 2 is 2013 American action comedy film and sequel to Red 2010. It was inspired by the limited comic book series of the same name created by Warren Ellis and Cully Hamner and published by the DC Comics imprint Homage. 910 Score A Studio Summit Entertainment Di Bonaventura Pictures DC Entertainment Starring Bruce Willis John Malkovich MaryLouise Parker Catherine ZetaJones Byunghun Lee Anthony Hopkins Helen Mirren Director Dean Parisot Screenplay Jon Hoeber Erich Hoeber Based on Red by Warren Ellis Cully Hamner Producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura Rated PG13 Running Time 1 Hr. 56 Mins.

If the goal was to top the first one in terms of ridiculous and cartoony action then bravo they succeeded. However this also feels like a hollow attempt at outdoing what worked so well about the first one. Whereas the first one was understated and spent some time developing the characters to a degree this throws a lot of that out of the window and goes for a fullon explosion and shootout fest.

One only wishes that their last film together had been more of a success. They had done first rate sequels before with GRUMPIER OLD MEN but that film had been done within two years of GRUMPY OLD MEN and a natural momentum carried the stars and supporting casts to the finish line. That is not the case with THE ODD COUPLE II. It came out thirty years after the original THE ODD COUPLE and while they are reunited with the play's creator Neil Simon on the screenplay the momentum  the push  is lacking.Not that this is a boring film. Far from it. We always wondered how Oscar Madison and Felix Unger would have behaved as elderly men. Of course Felix looked like he and Gloria were going to settle their differences and return together in the first playmovie. Indeed in the television series Tony Randall did get back to his wife. But here it is obvious it did not work at all. Both men have remained divorced and both men remain essential the same Felix the compulsively organized neatnik and Oscar the incorrigible slob. They also have given each other a wide birth if possible. But they find themselves drawn back into mutual orbit. Oscar's son is getting married  and to Felix's daughter. So the pair are headed for the wedding and that means jointly showing up.What happens is a series of joint misadventures on the way to the wedding especially involving two rather fun young women that they meet Christine Baranski and Jean Smart with their jealous boyfriends. This leads to several increasingly odd runins with the sheriff of a small town they can't seem to successfully leave. Indeed in one case they get a lift out of town in a beautiful white classic Rolls Royce which moves more slowly than a pair of people on bicycles.The situations are all quite amusing. But the unity of the film is not there  it is like a series of skits involving Felix and Oscar that are vaguely united because the two characters are familiar to us and they are supposed to get to the wedding. Still the two stars give it their all and with Baranski Smart and the late Bernard Hughes it works well enough as an entertainment. But for me the wackiness and variety of OUT TO SEA make that film a better final film for the pair.".

The script by the great Neil Simon was very hit and miss with the jokes and the whole premise of both of them going to their children's wedding was forced. The direction and editing was pretty sloppy and there was a moment when they were walking in the desert when I almost had a brief flash back of when I saw the movie Ishtar.

	schema:reviewBody "It is sad to think that we will not have any more gems from either of these two screen legends. Lemmon was a great actor as can be seen in any one of his many films particularly Days of Wine and Roses Glen Garry Glen Ross. He had a broad range and could play comedy with the best of them Mr. Roberts How to Murder Your Wife etc. Matthau was a breed apart having done many dramatic roles in is early career The Kentuckian Fail Safe but it was light comedy where he truly shined. He was one of those true naturals. So after the Grumpy Old Men successes they are paired for The Odd Couple II. From the broad range of commentary here there are those who celebrate this film and those who think it is lame. I feel it has good performances in a soso plot but it think it was a bad choice. They were both great in the first Odd Couple but who can deny that they abdicated the roles of Oscar and Felix to two consummate professionals Jack Klugman and Tony Randall on TV? They polished those roles to perfection and they had done all that could be done with them. It was pointless for Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau to go there again.For me Grumpy Old Men is how I would like to remember them. That film had a good story and was supported by a great team of veterans Burgess Meredith in particular. In that film even the outtakes are great.The Odd Couple II reminds me in many ways of Tough Guys. Both films had legends both as teams and as individual actors so when Kirk Douglas and Burt Lancaster appear together for the last time you want for them to have something really special. That is what we wanted for Jack Lemmon and Walther Matthau. These films are okay but only because the actors are in them. They are not good enough movies to honor their memories.".

	onyx:emotionText "It is sad to think that we will not have any more gems from either of these two screen legends. Lemmon was a great actor as can be seen in any one of his many films particularly Days of Wine and Roses Glen Garry Glen Ross. He had a broad range and could play comedy with the best of them Mr. Roberts How to Murder Your Wife etc. Matthau was a breed apart having done many dramatic roles in is early career The Kentuckian Fail Safe but it was light comedy where he truly shined. He was one of those true naturals. So after the Grumpy Old Men successes they are paired for The Odd Couple II. From the broad range of commentary here there are those who celebrate this film and those who think it is lame. I feel it has good performances in a soso plot but it think it was a bad choice. They were both great in the first Odd Couple but who can deny that they abdicated the roles of Oscar and Felix to two consummate professionals Jack Klugman and Tony Randall on TV? They polished those roles to perfection and they had done all that could be done with them. It was pointless for Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau to go there again.For me Grumpy Old Men is how I would like to remember them. That film had a good story and was supported by a great team of veterans Burgess Meredith in particular. In that film even the outtakes are great.The Odd Couple II reminds me in many ways of Tough Guys. Both films had legends both as teams and as individual actors so when Kirk Douglas and Burt Lancaster appear together for the last time you want for them to have something really special.

Howard Duetch who also directed the hilarious Grumpier Old Men does a fine job switching between the dramatic and comedic moments. Not a great film but an entertaining one with quite a few guffaws.

And since this is done in real years Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau who played them on screen back in the Sixties aged right along side the characters they played. No one else could have done proper justice to Felix and Oscar and fortunately they were both alive to get the job done.A lot has happened in the intervening years. Simon for some reason made Matthau far more ethnically Jewish in this version which finds Oscar living in a senior citizens center writing for a local paper covering minor league baseball and indulging in his weekly pastime of penny ante poker with some contemporaries. He's still the same grouchy lovable slob he always was. I do love that bombs away scene with the garbage bags from his apartment I can't say more.And then he learns that his son is marrying his old roommate Felix's daughter and both are invited to the wedding out in Southern California. Enter Jack Lemmon who after making himself a royal pest to the crew on the New York flight to California meets up with Matthau where they rent a car and journey to the small southern California town all of which begin with either San or Los in their names. Don't believe me look at a map of California and see what I'm talking about. That is after leaving Felix's plastic bag wrapped suitcase on the curb.After that for a good half the picture Lemmon and Matthau are alone on the screen and that's what the moviegoing public paid to see in 1998 in their last joint project. Two of the greatest comic actors and I say that and not comedians doing their best with some of the most impeccable timing and diction and in Matthau's case one of the most expressive faces in film history. Getting involved with a pair of rednecks and their slutty wives and getting into a car with an aged Barnard Hughes who just stops living and getting stuck with a truck of illegal immigrants are the three situations that put them in the jurisdiction of Sheriff Richard Riehl who gets tired of hosting these two in his jail.Comes the wedding and the aftermath and all I can say there is Oscar as a sportswriter who covered the Yankees would be familiar with what Yogi Berra said about 'De Ja Vu all over again'.Oscar and Felix they're back they're better than ever and with both Lemmon and Matthau now gone we're sadder for the fact they'll never return.".

The plot is okay  a buddy road trip on the way to a wedding...only for a change it's senior citizens. The situations are HUMOROUS but not laughoutloud funny. The principal actors Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau do their jobs while the supporting actors and actresses also do theirs. It's an amusing movie. And if you don't know much about Lemmon and Matthau that's all it will be to you.The other way to judge this film is by looking at it as the closing act of a REAL buddy team of two actors who have shared a big part of their lives together both professionally and personally. Then it doesn't matter if the film is as outwardly funny as it is charmingly humorous. You sit there thinking of their first film together  the first The Odd Couple  and you reminisce. Their first outing with The Fortune Cookie their most memorable romp in The Odd Couple the hilarity of The Front Page their renaissance in Grumpy Old Men and Grumpier Old Men and even their not so great Out to Sea and Buddy Buddy. You admire them for what they meant individually and collectively to American cinema. And as you watch the scene of them parting at the airport just maybe you think of Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn in that scene in Guess Who's Coming Together where they both know the end is almost upon them...not in film but in real life. And you see the wistfulness of the parting scene between Lemmon and Matthau probably realizing that this is the last film together.So how to judge this film? Factually or sentimentally? For me more the latter because it's a hearty farewell and thank you both for the laughs you have given me.".

Now almost three decades later Simon has rewritten it so that what is essentially the same plot finds Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau frustrated in their attempts to travel to the Californian nuptials of Lemmon's daughter and Matthau's son. I'm not criticizing or complaining. Anything written by Simon is fine with me and anything written by Simon and featuring Lemmon and Matthau is even finer and there are after all only seven basic plots as we all know. The leads of course are reprising the characters Felix Ungar and Oscar Madison they played in The Odd Couple Matthau had in fact created the role of Oscar Madison in the original Broadway production and though it is widely acknowledged that sequels rarely work this is an exception with enough Simon oneliners to keep most of us happy.

It goes without saying that this movie is the sequel to the 1968 Odd Couple.  More precisely however it is the hilarious sequel.  Madison and Unger's repartee has not changed over these thirty years.  This is surely due to Lemon and Mathau's wonderful chemistry which we have seen time and time again in any of the other movies they have teamed up for.  As with the 1968 version the bickering the fighting and threats to one another Oscar's various vices and Felix's many forms of hypochondria all converge in a nonstop vehicle of conflict confrontation even conflagration.  Oscar's the cynic and Felix the romantic.  Underneath of course they are best of friends and it is for friendship that all the friction makes us laugh.  And we do laugh  nonstop. Best of all perhaps we are treated to a very funny tribute to two of the funniest characters in moviedom.  And in keeping with the scale of the tribute this movie is also about movies.  It is not only reminiscent of the original it serves up reminders of It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World The Good the Bad and the Ugly intimations on Thelma and Louise North by Northwest and of course My Best Friend's Wedding.  While for nostalgia and an aversion to tampering what is has already been done well the first time i.e. the proverbial curse of the sequel we may find the first Odd couple more to our liking.  We may find the unfolding of events in 1998 a little too fantastic when we compare them to 1968. We may prefer that Oscar and Felix sport a little more of the depth of character development that occurred in the earlier take on them.  But it remains that this second offering of these two characters presents more of the same hilarity and more of a good thing is always better.".

While the original was mainly performance and character driven which is what made it so innovative this one has little to do with the actual characters of Felix and Oscar and their bad chemistry together. It is more plot driven which is what kills it. In fact it could have been any two people with the exact same plot and nothing would change whereas in the original the character's behaviour would have effected the plot a bit.       Not only that but there's no more satire and comments on marriage and divorce except the little bit at the end which I felt was out of character for the play. You would think there would also be a comment on growing old and dying together but there isn't because the plot gets in the way. Some may say that movies now have to be more plot driven and not as simplistic as they were 50 years ago but I'd have to say they're wrong. A plot can still ruin a movie while one which is simply performance based can still make it today. Anyhow the original is still much more popular.".

From the moment Matthau says his first line we were almost certain that he was up to no good but still in a way which made us like him even more than Lemmon the put upon character. Then there was the first Odd Couple and the magic was still there. That film was simply brilliant because the lines were snappier and Lemmon was much more funny than expected.Here it simply doesn't work. I can't exactly put my finger on it but it seems that putting Oscar and Felix in a road trip movie is just an excuse to see how many senile old man jokes the director can come up with. First of all they forget which town they are going to which isn't very funny to begin with. Then their car goes over a cliff a joke that really belongs in a Warner Bros. cartoon and last they get arrested not once but several times. Not very funny. Oh yes I almost forgot about the driver who only goes about 2 miles an hour and then croaks. Ha Ha.Lemmon was a multitalent who could both be outrageously funny and dead serious and Matthau could deliver in both ways too although he was always more of a comic actor. It's sad that they are both gone now and seeing this is like going to a carnival and discover that all the rides are broken.".

	schema:headline " A funny sequel even if there are parts that don't work as well";
	schema:reviewBody "Prior to the start of the 21rst century movie franchises that had sequels were more or less on time with their releases. Other sets of movies were created not long after. This was due to movie studios finding it to be profitable and producing a sequel almost every year. Whether or not they actually were of good quality is a separate matter. The point is sequels came in a rather systematic fashion. Rarely were sequels made years later except for some. A very mainstream movie series that has quite a number of years in between its entries was James Cameron's The Terminator 1984 film. Terminator 2 Judgement Day 1991 came several years later and Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines 2003 was even longer still. However the longest awaited sequel ever to be made might in fact be this movie since its predecessor goes back three decades!The Odd Couple 1968 was based on a play written by Neil Simon. This story would then also receive a TV show adaptation. But as for this sequel the script was also written by Neil Simon but was completely original. Nothing had been written before as to what would happen if the two main odd balls would reunite. For this film it just so happens that the daughter of Felix Unger Jack Lemmon and son of Oscar Madison Walter Matthau are getting married. When Oscar and Felix cross paths the madness begins. The question is will they reach the wedding in time? For being a sequel that came far after its original the play out to this feature is not as bad as one might think. Heading the production was Howard Deutch. He's mainly known for directing TV shows now. Deutch also worked with Matthau and Lemmon in Grumpier Old Men 1995.What does work here are the two stars and thankfully much of the supporting cast. Even for thirty years later Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are great at reprising their all time famous roles. Lemmon still plays Felix as about as stressed as ever while Matthau plays Oscar just as relaxed and out of touch as well. Both still have the same likable chemistry and great wisecracks towards each other. The next actor to have some funny scenes is Richard Riehle the local sheriff. As Oscar and Felix try to reach their family's wedding they continuously run into Riehle's character. Seeing his reaction every time after the first gets more comical. As for the couple getting married Brucey Jonathan Silverman and Hannah Lisa Waltz are both okay in their roles but they really don't have a lot of shine time.The parts that aren't effective in the story deal a lot with how the script was written. The plus side is that Neil Simon takes the scenario between the iconic duo and shows the audience what happens when these two are let out of their cages. Yet somehow there's a lack of witty dialog among the whole running time. Matthau and Lemmon are wonderful no doubt but they can't work alone. Part of what made The Odd Couple 1968 funny was the funny supporting cast. Aside from Riehle there's not many other actors to find hilarious. On top of that there a couple of scenes that have the two leads dropping the F bomb. The original movie did not use that word at all and it was still hilarious. So what was the point of using it now? Lastly there's a brief subplot that comes up out of nowhere and is quickly settled so again why bring it up to begin with?But aside from this there are appearances from other actors like Mary Beth Peil Christine Baranski Jean Smart Rex Linn Jay O. Sanders and even Earl Boen. For camerawork the shots captured are decent for the picture. Credited as cinematographer was Jamie Anderson. Unlike the original where much of the settings took place in the apartment now the whole adventure takes place outside and there's lots to see. Anderson was also the DP to movies like Piranha 1978 Unlawful Entry 1992 and Small Soldiers 1998 that same year. Lastly bringing forth the music was composer Alan Silvestri. Being known for all kinds of scores Silvestri did a great job revisiting the famous main theme from the original and it is repeated quite often in full orchestra. A job well done.While the script may suffer from unnecessary add ins and occasionally less energetic dialog the rest of the viewing experience is still enjoyable. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon remain the highlight of the feature with great exchanges acceptable cinematography and respectable music.".

Heading the production was Howard Deutch. He's mainly known for directing TV shows now. Deutch also worked with Matthau and Lemmon in Grumpier Old Men 1995.What does work here are the two stars and thankfully much of the supporting cast. Even for thirty years later Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are great at reprising their all time famous roles. Lemmon still plays Felix as about as stressed as ever while Matthau plays Oscar just as relaxed and out of touch as well. Both still have the same likable chemistry and great wisecracks towards each other. The next actor to have some funny scenes is Richard Riehle the local sheriff. As Oscar and Felix try to reach their family's wedding they continuously run into Riehle's character. Seeing his reaction every time after the first gets more comical. As for the couple getting married Brucey Jonathan Silverman and Hannah Lisa Waltz are both okay in their roles but they really don't have a lot of shine time.The parts that aren't effective in the story deal a lot with how the script was written. The plus side is that Neil Simon takes the scenario between the iconic duo and shows the audience what happens when these two are let out of their cages. Yet somehow there's a lack of witty dialog among the whole running time. Matthau and Lemmon are wonderful no doubt but they can't work alone. Part of what made The Odd Couple 1968 funny was the funny supporting cast. Aside from Riehle there's not many other actors to find hilarious. On top of that there a couple of scenes that have the two leads dropping the F bomb. The original movie did not use that word at all and it was still hilarious. So what was the point of using it now? Lastly there's a brief subplot that comes up out of nowhere and is quickly settled so again why bring it up to begin with?But aside from this there are appearances from other actors like Mary Beth Peil Christine Baranski Jean Smart Rex Linn Jay O. Sanders and even Earl Boen. For camerawork the shots captured are decent for the picture. Credited as cinematographer was Jamie Anderson. Unlike the original where much of the settings took place in the apartment now the whole adventure takes place outside and there's lots to see. Anderson was also the DP to movies like Piranha 1978 Unlawful Entry 1992 and Small Soldiers 1998 that same year. Lastly bringing forth the music was composer Alan Silvestri. Being known for all kinds of scores Silvestri did a great job revisiting the famous main theme from the original and it is repeated quite often in full orchestra. A job well done.While the script may suffer from unnecessary add ins and occasionally less energetic dialog the rest of the viewing experience is still enjoyable. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon remain the highlight of the feature with great exchanges acceptable cinematography and respectable music.";

But anything that can go wrong will go wrong when you're dealing with these grumpy old men.Normally I don't think you wait 30 years to make a sequel... but they did it probably setting some kind of record. And you know I liked this film. I watched it with my brother and my father and I found it to be a good film for a family to watch but an older family because the language is a little bad. It's funny in a more or less clean way no smut and it's a nobrainer film just more of Mathau and Lemmon tearing into each other.I liked some of the jokes more than others the crutch store is pretty funny and a lot of it was sort of cheesy. But it's also cute to see two old men try to pick up women half their age and get stranded in a desert. That's just so silly  old men! Old men who aren't timid with no secrets.That's really all I can say about this one. It's just like watching Grumpy Old Men but it's in California rather than in the woods. Otherwise it may as well be the same film. Which works. Because unlike other films that seem to be copies of themselves this has more of a Laurel and Hardy or Abbott and Costello feel where you can't imagine these old men doing anything differently.

	schema:reviewBody "Who started this trend of turning '60s cartoons into new live action? I'd say Spielberg with The Flintstones. That one at least worked. But it was sadly the camel's nose under the tent.Did Hugh Wilson even WATCH any Dudley DoRight cartoons as a kid? Did he rent videos or catch the Cartoon Channel? None of that shows.The classic scene of the cartoon Snidely tying Nell to the tracks ... is STILL a cartoon here. They didn't even try to render the credits it in live action as with The Flintstones.Dudley a blonde in the cartoon was a brunette actor. He smiles a lot has a big hero's chin and is sort of dim but not such a stumblebum.And Nell a redhead in the cartoon was a blonde actress. But wait ... Sarah Jessica Parker isn't REALLY blonde. She had to color her hair or wear a wig and STILL got it wrong.Nell in the cartoon was content to live at the camp. But she was NOT stuck between Dudley and Snidely. Rather she was stuck on HORSE!! And what happened to Horse's Mountie shirt and hat? This one in the movie was just a regular saddled horse. Inspector Fenwick in the cartoon is the camp commandant a fistpounding boss not a softspoken retiree. And he wears the red uniform just like Dudley. Was Hugh Wilson being accurate by having someone of the inspector's rank wear black? Why bother being accurate on this obscure point if you can't get the obvious things right?The real Snidely Whiplash has green skin. I forgive Alfred Molina for not donning greasepaint through the film. But at least we get a scene of him with a green face in the mudbath. Snidely is the ONLY character they got right.Other problems The cartoon very obviously took place during the Klondike or Yukon Gold Rush days. The playerpiano score gave it away. Were talking late 19th century. They would NOT have helicopters cars tanks etc.I remember back in the '60s the trend was the turn our beloved liveaction heroes into cartoons and see them REALLY soar. Gone were the expenses of having to string George Reeves up on wires to have Superman fly. Now we could see Superman really fly and take on actual comicbook supervillains instead of always gangsters. And we got the Lone Ranger Batman and eventually Star Trek in toon form and they all worked by doing things that would have been way too expensive in live action.Don't any of the directors remember that these cartoons were made for a reason? Too expensive to film live!Spielberg made The Flintstones work as nostalgia because he has the cash to be exacting in detail. For Hugh Wilson and all the rest the lesson is simple Watch the cartoon note recurring themes and most of all don't do the show if you ain't got the dough!".

	schema:reviewBody "My five year old adored Brendan Fraser in Disney's George of the Jungle. I loved the movie too and we saw it a total of nine times over the four months it ran at local theatres in the summer of 1998. We now own on it DVD it was the first one we ever purchased and its publication prompted us to buy the player for my computer in fact. What made George of the Jungle so great was that Disney remained true to character of the cartoon George and built an exciting and wellwritten plot around a very fine performance by one of the cutest actors to ever come out of Hollywood. My son and I would sit in the theatre and laugh ourselves silly as joke after joke had the kids and parents rolling in the aisles. George was sweet funny and for the moms very very sexy. You could see Fraser's talent and intelligence shining through in places and the result was incredibly likeable.Unfortunately Fraser's Dudley is less than stupid inconsistently clumsy and completely lacking in any charm whatsoever. I think that Fraser's underlying intelligence actually works against his moronic character and despite playing opposite a convincing Snidely Whiplash Fraser's performance is frankly horrible! I'm not sure if it's Fraser's fault though. What can anyone do no matter how much he dimples to win over an audience to what has to be the most inconsistently developed and poorly written characters of all time? One moment we are asked to love Dudley for his clumsiness and purity of heart. Then we are asked to applaud Do Right's transition into a machine gun toting biker bad boy who is suddenly and inexplicably traipsing about in an animal skin loincloth no less like a Solid Gold dancer. And of the Native American musical just how does one clog in moccasins and bare feet? Even the sound effects in the film were senseless.I wasn't the only one who hated the film either. Bored with trying to read my son's Batman comic book during light scenes I looked around sometime near the middle of the movie to find kids fidgeting in their seats and parents yawning. A few adults were close to tears with boredom and I noticed that precisely at 820 when there was still time to grab tickets for the next showing of A Dog in Flanders almost half of the audience left the theatre. I grabbed our things but my son excited to see Fraser again made me stay. How I came to envy those parents with children less stubborn than my own! Only twice I heard laughter and once I joined in. There were a total of four clever lines in the film in the scene where Dudley is being trained to be bad by some innocuous dirty miner who simply shows up for no discernible reason. He tells George Now say I am dangerous. Dudley replies You are dangerous. The miner makes a face and says No say you are dangerous.I already said that. says Dudley.This is almost as clever as the repartee between Bugs and Daffy in the episodes where they vie to convince Elmer which of them he should shoot but Warner can certainly sustain this kind of thing longer and I don't have to shell out over twelve dollars for my son and myself to see it. With Dudley things simply went from bad to worse and culminated into a cinematic experience that I found even more disgusting than that hitherto greatest of all celluloid stinkbombs Highlander 2. You would think that such a simplistic character as a bungling Canadian Mountie could have translated fairly easily onto the big screen. What's not to understand about Dudley? He's drawn in simple lines has predictable dialogue and only comes in three colours. Yet Disney managed to fail utterly. They even misunderstood Nell if you can believe that this version of the irritating little blonde has a string of graduate degrees and then has trouble deciding if she should choose Snidely over Dudley. Of course this Dudley was so lame that he did make Snidely look good but I still think that two hours of reruns of the cartoons would have been more entertaining than the plotless wonder I was forced to see till its end. Not only did the movie fail to portray Do Right within any scope of reasonable resemblance but they went on to change what the filmmakers obviously did not understand. If you make Dudley bad or graceful you completely lose any coherence in his character. He simply doesn't make sense any more and that's not amusing that's punishment for parents whose children won't allow them to leave early. In sum although my five year old defends the film it is this adult's perspective that this movie sucks like a tornado eh. I truly hated it. If Fraser doesn't get himself a new agent and do some better work I don't know how I can take my son see another one of the travesties on film that he's been getting himself caught up in. For shame Disney for shame what you did to that wonderful young man and to your audience!".

You know from time to time I need to watch a bad movie to appreciate the good ones. However this was way too much. Dudley or if you prefer Dulley tries to be funny but he's just a moron nothing else. Whip however is better mainly because he's around world champions suckers. Even Nell with a good education and many degrees as she said is stupid as Dudley not funny at all and worse of all nearly a whore switching between Dudley and Whip. Who seems to be the most intelligent character is Horse the horse doh because most of the time it's gone Horse knew that to be in another movie it should reduce its exposure on this one. The story is the standard the good guy beats the bad guy and gets the girl. You can't even consider that a spoiler it's just a fact knowing what the movie it's base on. If you think this movie can entertain your child think again you would be better with any TV cartoon than with this. Believe me. If I have to rate this one I'll give 2 out of 10. Yes above two is overrated.".

The movie was advertised as brought to you by the producers of George of the Jungle which of course implies that it might be in the same ballpark in quality. Unfortunately that's not the case at all. While the two movies share a couple of the same producers they don't share directors or writers. Dudley DoRight was directed and written by Hugh Wilson who directedwrote the amusing Blast from the Past which came out six months before Do Right. As such you would think DoRight would be a decent goofy comedy but it's not. It's starts off with an overlong irrelevant and pointless cartoon and never recovers. The zany jokes fall flat except for a couple and this is from someone who enjoys stoopid humor.What's utterly amazing is that DoRight cost a whopping 70 million in 1999 dollars. Blast from the Past only cost half that much and George of the Jungle 1997 15 million less than DoRight! Where'd all the money go? You certainly don't see it on the screen or in the writing. Of course Fraser is likable and fitting as Dudley and Molina eats up the role of Whiplash but their jokes are lame and unfunny. Parker might have worked but she's underutilized. Really the only sequences that perked my attention are the Native American theater scenes and in the third act when Dudley morphs into a bad dude to beat Whiplash but even these scenes aren't anything to write home about.Simply put Dudley DoRight is a DUD.The film runs 77 minutes and was shot in British Columbia and Santa Clarita CA.GRADE D".

He lives in a small cabin with only his horse Horse as a companion. Yet two people from Dudley's past resurface in the small nearby village. One is Nell Sara Jessica Parker who Dudley has loved since their tweenage years. She has returned from a trip around the world and is more lovely than ever. But alas the other returnee is the dastardly Snidely Whiplash Alfred Molina. He was Dudley's rival for Nell's affections long ago despite his evil and conniving ways. Soon Snidely has taken over the town's businesses by hook and by crook and is making a big play for Nell's attention while Dudley manages to upset the ruling party in Ottawa and is fired from his post.

This is a second cartoonbased film for Fraser after the infinitely more successful George of the Jungle. The same creative minds were at work here but the results are far from perfect. Don't blame the cast however for Fraser Parker and Molina with a bit of help from Eric Idle and Alex Rocco are the reasons to see the film at all. Simply put they are terrific and rise above the mundane script and uneven direction. Certainly there are some very funny scenes such as the one in which Snidely orders a poor lady and her children out of their home or where Dudley has the bad luck to have a moose head fall on him during a critical moment with Nell. Now that's entertainment. Unfortunately though a few good scenes do not a great film make. Yet if you like silly nonsense with likable stars you might take a chance with this film. Yes it may elicit a yawn here or there but it's truly not a bad way to spend a couple of leisure hours.".

	schema:headline " This is Canada Nell. Things are real up here";
	schema:reviewBody "There are two kinds of bad comedies. The first kind  let's call them the 'Adam Sandlers'  lazily try to dispute their indisputable 'bad' status. Braying with smarmy selfimportance and bleating for affirmation they're all the more contemptible for it. The second kind are the Dudley DoRights sweet innocent creatures either dopily unaware or uncaring of their fundamental mediocrity. Content to simply be they provide the basest of childish entertainment at all costs. We're talking the kind of cinema where the same 'getting bonked in the head by a loose floorboard' gag if you can call it that is repeated not once. Not twice not three times. But upwards of eight. You know in case you didn't get enough in Brendan Fraser's former George of the Jungle. But that's not the only trick up the film's sleeve! Love farting horses? Then oh boy do we have a show for you!Tone is everything though. And it's because of this that Dudley DoRight almost worrisomely idiotic as it mostly is is resoundingly hard not to take to. It's unflinchingly cheery and earnest banking hard on every Canadian stereotype in the book without a hint of ironic revisionism. In doing so it steadily wears the viewer down until it's almost impossible to resist a sheepish smile creeping across their face. It helps that creator Jay Ward's sly sensibility of playing things so ludicrously straight that a sneaky cleverness creeps up we get a welcome reminder in the film's fantastic oldtimey 'Fractured Fairy tales' opening short is dutifully replicated if not perfected by writerdirector Hugh Wilson. He makes particularly good use of a joyfully hokey narrator and allows occasional cheeky bits to creep in enough to keep adults from drifting off entirely amidst the lazy slapstick and tritely wholesome morals. For example here uberfiend Snidely Whiplash has evolved past simply tying damsels to train tracks but don't worry  they've left one such sequence for posterity to a more devious scheme involving rentcontrolled properties and converting the superbly named SemiHappy Valley into an exploitatively garish faux goldrush tourist town. It's a ploy so grotesque that it's naturally almost too close to home to laugh at especially when Ottawa signs off on it for economic stimulation and job creation leaving contemporary Canadian audiences flinching with unwanted flashbacks to the methodology of a certain unsavoury former administration but let's not harp on about that.Sure there's a bit of a clash between the film's overall rustic read cheap look and the oddly inflated production values in its dance and vehicular chase scenes though I'll never say no to impromptu tanks in a climactic showdown. And yes there's a recurring bit involving a First Nations community which isn't as tongueincheek as it'd like to think dabbling in dubious racial politics and don't worry  Brendan Fraser gets in on the redface too. Errgh.... It's mitigated barely by the superb commentary of how intensely 'authentic' it is while the Chief later grumbles that they're basically doing dinner theatre here with their Riverdance bit being a particularly good seller. But hey  if Wilson's tentative forays into sociopolitical satire aren't for you there's always a woodland training montage with a gamely silly comedy drunk Eric Idle a surprisingly tasteful nod to Raiders of the Lost Ark with Alfred Molina and... y'know...a bit where Dudley crashes around his lodge wearing a giant moose head. And you know you're a hoser if you can't appreciate a giant moose head gag.Brendan Fraser has built a career around playing adorably dim live action cartoon characters and is astute enough to play Dudley's clueless earnestness wholly straight. He doesn't have much to work with here but he pours on the charm like no tomorrow and is winningly affable for it. Similarly the always superb Alfred Molina is exquisitely cartoony bagging the majority of the film's meagre laughs and embodying Snidely Whiplash's trademark sneer with such outrageous commitment that it's almost alarming to see him turn around and realize he's still a threedimensional live action human. The normally intolerable Sarah Jessica Parker delivers the film's most remarkable feat by being...tolerable in fact her simpering vacuous Nell is almost likable even vaguely funny at times although juxtaposing her apparent slew of postsecondary degrees with her voluminous stupidity is a conceit which wears thin very quickly. Finally adult viewers caught in the existential throes of 'how did I get here' might recognize Jack Kehler otherwise known as the Dude's awkward landlord from The Big Lebowski playing an expanded version of the same character as Snidely's secondincommand here which brings delights of its own.Dudley DoRight is not a good film by any stretch of the imagination and even the youngest of kids are likely to call the bluff of its lazy repetitive shallow attempts at humour.

	onyx:emotionText "There are two kinds of bad comedies. The first kind  let's call them the 'Adam Sandlers'  lazily try to dispute their indisputable 'bad' status. Braying with smarmy selfimportance and bleating for affirmation they're all the more contemptible for it. The second kind are the Dudley DoRights sweet innocent creatures either dopily unaware or uncaring of their fundamental mediocrity. Content to simply be they provide the basest of childish entertainment at all costs. We're talking the kind of cinema where the same 'getting bonked in the head by a loose floorboard' gag if you can call it that is repeated not once. Not twice not three times. But upwards of eight. You know in case you didn't get enough in Brendan Fraser's former George of the Jungle. But that's not the only trick up the film's sleeve! Love farting horses? Then oh boy do we have a show for you!Tone is everything though. And it's because of this that Dudley DoRight almost worrisomely idiotic as it mostly is is resoundingly hard not to take to. It's unflinchingly cheery and earnest banking hard on every Canadian stereotype in the book without a hint of ironic revisionism. In doing so it steadily wears the viewer down until it's almost impossible to resist a sheepish smile creeping across their face. It helps that creator Jay Ward's sly sensibility of playing things so ludicrously straight that a sneaky cleverness creeps up we get a welcome reminder in the film's fantastic oldtimey 'Fractured Fairy tales' opening short is dutifully replicated if not perfected by writerdirector Hugh Wilson. He makes particularly good use of a joyfully hokey narrator and allows occasional cheeky bits to creep in enough to keep adults from drifting off entirely amidst the lazy slapstick and tritely wholesome morals. For example here uberfiend Snidely Whiplash has evolved past simply tying damsels to train tracks but don't worry  they've left one such sequence for posterity to a more devious scheme involving rentcontrolled properties and converting the superbly named SemiHappy Valley into an exploitatively garish faux goldrush tourist town. It's a ploy so grotesque that it's naturally almost too close to home to laugh at especially when Ottawa signs off on it for economic stimulation and job creation leaving contemporary Canadian audiences flinching with unwanted flashbacks to the methodology of a certain unsavoury former administration but let's not harp on about that.Sure there's a bit of a clash between the film's overall rustic read cheap look and the oddly inflated production values in its dance and vehicular chase scenes though I'll never say no to impromptu tanks in a climactic showdown. And yes there's a recurring bit involving a First Nations community which isn't as tongueincheek as it'd like to think dabbling in dubious racial politics and don't worry  Brendan Fraser gets in on the redface too. Errgh.... It's mitigated barely by the superb commentary of how intensely 'authentic' it is while the Chief later grumbles that they're basically doing dinner theatre here with their Riverdance bit being a particularly good seller. But hey  if Wilson's tentative forays into sociopolitical satire aren't for you there's always a woodland training montage with a gamely silly comedy drunk Eric Idle a surprisingly tasteful nod to Raiders of the Lost Ark with Alfred Molina and... y'know...a bit where Dudley crashes around his lodge wearing a giant moose head. And you know you're a hoser if you can't appreciate a giant moose head gag.Brendan Fraser has built a career around playing adorably dim live action cartoon characters and is astute enough to play Dudley's clueless earnestness wholly straight. He doesn't have much to work with here but he pours on the charm like no tomorrow and is winningly affable for it. Similarly the always superb Alfred Molina is exquisitely cartoony bagging the majority of the film's meagre laughs and embodying Snidely Whiplash's trademark sneer with such outrageous commitment that it's almost alarming to see him turn around and realize he's still a threedimensional live action human. The normally intolerable Sarah Jessica Parker delivers the film's most remarkable feat by being...tolerable in fact her simpering vacuous Nell is almost likable even vaguely funny at times although juxtaposing her apparent slew of postsecondary degrees with her voluminous stupidity is a conceit which wears thin very quickly. Finally adult viewers caught in the existential throes of 'how did I get here' might recognize Jack Kehler otherwise known as the Dude's awkward landlord from The Big Lebowski playing an expanded version of the same character as Snidely's secondincommand here which brings delights of its own.Dudley DoRight is not a good film by any stretch of the imagination and even the youngest of kids are likely to call the bluff of its lazy repetitive shallow attempts at humour. And yet Wilson's touch is so perennially chipper that the simplistic adventures of everyone's favourite cartoon Mountie here  thanks largely to tireless efforts by Molina and Fraser's innate goofy charisma  are still liable to raise a smile. And if you aren't able to suspend some measure of disbelief and ride out Dudley Do Right with kernels of the most forgiving enjoyment... well then take off eh?410";

The 1973 volcanic eruption of Eldfell forced him to move the family to the mainland. Retirement does not come easy and it's clear that for some time Hannes has become estranged from his wife and family. On a topical note his daughter Telma has just been promoted as a loans manager in a bank  to the disgust of her father. His son Ari is divorced but usually has his small son in tow. Most longsuffering is Anna the matriarch of the family. Who's really loved by her husband but when her children are around she has to suffer his intolerance and volatile moods.

	schema:reviewBody "Watching director Rnar Rnarsson's feature debut now cannot circumvent this epithet the Icelandic version of AMOUR 2012 only VOLCANO came one year earlier. Compared to AMOUR it does't match the former's metaphorical conceit but as a debut Rnarsson adeptly chronicles this slowburner with unadorned humanism and uncompromising dedication. Our protagonist Hannes Jlusson is introduced by his retirement party and begins to adopt his new life pattern with his wife Anna Jhannsdttir but his withdrawn personality and the deficit in communicating with his two children Ari Bachmann and Telma Gunnarsdttir creates a family gap Ari and Telma can never understand why their mother marries a man who has never been good to her. Yes there are only two people knows the truth of their marriage. After a leakage in Hannes' tiny boat and a makeup sex which is quite audacious for two elderly actors and the mastermind behind it the unexpected happens Anna has a stroke but survives against the will of Ari and Telma Hannes decides to take care of her at home then we journey through Hannes' daytoday effort of attending to Anna meanwhile I was thinking please don't let it be a reenactment of AMOUR please don't! Yet eventually a tough decision must be made but unlike Trintignant and Riva's bourgeois harmony Hannes and Anna's marriage is more or less on the rocks which prompts Hannes' behaviour to look like a redemption for all those years of negligence a remorseful realisation of not cherishing the beloved one until time is running out. Rnarsson has no qualm of showing audience the cruelty but he also refuses to imprint his personal judgement on it arguably one can interpret Anna's whimpering as her final request and Hannes merely executes it despite of all the unwillingness. Leading actor Theodr Jlusson's performance is quietly powerful incredibly engaging in betraying Hannes' flux of mind under the introverted surface and he is consummately believable to embody a lifelike character besides performing well in several pathos rendering scenes. Margrt Helga Jhannsdttir although her role is truncated to a vegetable halfway through apart from her unvarying moaning is equally daring and admirable for Anna there is no clear indication of her condition's deterioration so she is not so lucky as Riva in AMOUR. The volcano is presented in the opening sequences with a sublime aria and from what I glean in the film it signals as an abrupt changeover in one's life it is the volcano forced Hannes and Anna to leave their hometown for relocation which forever altered their trajectory so is Anna's stroke it will change the family eventually it cannot be stopped. In the end through a breathtaking shots of Iceland's unique terrain and sea view Rnarsson chooses to let nature speak to impress to marvel and to purify while Hannes and his grandson are sailing on the muted sea conveys the sense of succession like the film per se the spirit is also silent but tenacious.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review After School Midnighters";
	schema:reviewBody "I can't understand why After School Midnighters only managed 4 scheduled screenings here over this weekend given that Japanese anime has its audience in Singapore. Directed by Hitoshi Takekiyo this animated comedy film isn't quite the horror anime that the trailers may have touted it to be but has a relatively fun action adventure setting based on three little girls in Mako voiced by Haruka Tomatsu Mitsuko Minako Kotobuki and Miko Sakiko Uran who spend a day and night at St Claire Elementary School.During their day visit the trio had ventured into the Science Room and had a good time vandalizing two exhibits  an anatomical human body and a skeleton. Little do they know that like Toy Story these two forms known as Kunstlijk Kouichi Yamadera and Goth Hiromasa Taguchi respectively come to life when nobody's around. Angered by what the three girls had done Kunstlijk summoned them back to the school using an After School Midnight Party pass to entice them for the sole purpose of revenge while Goth is dead set against vengeance since he thinks the girls can help them save their Science Lab and their own obsolescence.It centers around the urban legend of three medals which when brought together can grant a wish. Think of it like the Dragon Balls. But in order to get those medals there are well the usual challenges that have to be overcome from the arenas of the Pool the Digital Room and the Music Room each having their own Boss to defeat before having the medal bestowed upon. This of course provides the set up for set action pieces the introduction of more quirky characters such as a merman to digital oracles and spirits of musical maestros and in some cases comedy as well. And the challenges may range from the mundane of outswimming the merman to more challenging ones like telling the oracles something new or to compose a song to impress the composers which is near impossible.But leave it to the three girls to come up with solutions and I have to admit they sort of grow on you as the film wore on. They couldn't be any more diverse in character and bring their own strengths to the film. There's the little missy rich brat in Mako Mu with her fringe covering most of her face and wearing that oversized dress coupled with a penchant of wanting to specimen almost everything in a bottle and there's Mi as the youngest and most eager of the lot. They're infectious and more so than the Power Puff Girls combined. Fearless too with a mean streak running in them that makes them the bane of some and the hope of others in the story.It's also pretty amazing that the narrative is rather expansive and has plenty of elements which may seem innocuous at the point of introduction but boy when it comes to the payload they all delivered at the right place and at the right time. And the plot elements can be as diverse as from gun totting rabbits to a time machine. Or how about an evil being known as Chabris manifesting itself as an awful looking fruit fly of sorts hell bent on destroying everything and being the chief antagonist for this big action adventure with everything coming together for that one big closed loop.The animation is a mix of simple designed characters to the more intricate ones such as Kunstlijk for his many internal parts that have to be shown to the details of his stripped down muscles. And besides the three girls Kunstlijk himself is quite the character being on both sides of the equation of the alpha type to being slapstick fodder especially when his various schemes go awry and backfire. Perhaps then it is his character that made After School Midnighters quite the engaging film it is through his looks or lack thereof to being the glue in which everything revolves around.It's a pity that After School Midnighters got an extremely limited release here so maybe it may find its way through some of the more specialized festivals to reach out to a wider audience.".

	onyx:emotionText "I can't understand why After School Midnighters only managed 4 scheduled screenings here over this weekend given that Japanese anime has its audience in Singapore. Directed by Hitoshi Takekiyo this animated comedy film isn't quite the horror anime that the trailers may have touted it to be but has a relatively fun action adventure setting based on three little girls in Mako voiced by Haruka Tomatsu Mitsuko Minako Kotobuki and Miko Sakiko Uran who spend a day and night at St Claire Elementary School.During their day visit the trio had ventured into the Science Room and had a good time vandalizing two exhibits  an anatomical human body and a skeleton. Little do they know that like Toy Story these two forms known as Kunstlijk Kouichi Yamadera and Goth Hiromasa Taguchi respectively come to life when nobody's around. Angered by what the three girls had done Kunstlijk summoned them back to the school using an After School Midnight Party pass to entice them for the sole purpose of revenge while Goth is dead set against vengeance since he thinks the girls can help them save their Science Lab and their own obsolescence.It centers around the urban legend of three medals which when brought together can grant a wish. Think of it like the Dragon Balls.

The major flaw that I see is that the progression of the plot is not clean cut. Never mind the visual quality as of course I don't expect a film such as this to be of the same standard with blockbuster DisneyPixar cartoons.

	schema:reviewBody "In a departure from her more common ragstoriches melodramas Crawford plays here an heiress who stumbles upon a handsome archaeologist leading to a complicated courtship as their worlds collide. While on a lengthy cruise of the Greek islands bored Crawford hires a donkey in a scene that must be seen to be believed! and tours Naxos on her own. Running to escape bandits she happens upon an excavation where Aherne is unearthing a buried statue. The pair proceeds to needle one other with Crawford deceiving Aherne into believing she's just a poor secretary and Aherne punishing her for exaggerating an injury. Despite this rocky first meeting they fall in love and Aherne crosses the Atlantic to see her again. Unfortunately she's already betrothed to New York hotshot Keating in a match that will greatly aid her father Morgan. Morgan exists under the thumb of his domineering motherinlaw Ralph and has striven to break free by taking some risky investments. Only a marriage between Keating and Crawford can save him. So Crawford has a big decision to make regardless of whether she can adapt to having Aherne a society outcast as a husband! Much maneuvering and flipflopping occurs with comedy both genuine and forced until the resolution. Crawford begins the film with a refreshing naturalness and ease. She's quite game for the physical needs of the role and looks great her hair even moves in the early sequences! Later she's done up in some utterly humongous eyelashes and an array of bodyswallowing Adrian creations which though they were the height of fantasy clothing for the era are often ludicrous and even unflattering! Somehow her later scenes just can't match the light touch she started out with near the beginning. Aherne who in certain shots and at certain angles resembles Jude Law is appealing most of the time and while hardly a star of the same caliber as Crawford holds his own rather well. He and Crawford establish a chemistry that makes the audience root for them to survive as a couple. One tremendous asset to the film is Morgan. His inimitable delivery and assured performance is a joy to behold. He forms an appealing bond with Crawford while essaying the cantankerous persona he excelled at in his career. No one however can outgrump Ralph as the old lady. Before she even appears her dictates mandates and orders are bandied about and her portraits loom on the various walls of homes and offices. The woman has a field day running roughshod over everyone in sight. Many other fine character actors from MGM's heyday appear in support as well. There is an unevenness in the film and it may not have been Crawford's forte but one could certainly do worse than to check out this glossy amiable film. Fans of Mommie Dearest will get a bit of a thrill watching Crawford trash the better part of a dressing room with lamps flying and pottery being smashed to bits. Crawford and Aherne would be reunited briefly in the film The Best of Everything as longterm coworkers of a book publishing firm.".

I have no problem with either Joan Crawford or Brian Aherne in the leads. They are both charming and lend the perfect role of sarcastic flirtatiousness called for. If one needs a serious theme to enjoy a film there is a peripheral theme of classconsciousness. One of the film's highlights is the chemistry between Crawford and Frank Morgan who plays her father that's precious stuff. It's easy to praise Arthur Treacher Jessie Ralph and Eric Blore. But how about Sterling Holloway in a small but memorable role as Aherne's assistant at the archaeological dig? Aline MacMahon Frank Conroy all these character actors insure the acting level is high throughout. My only regret is that Granville Bates the yacht captain didn't have a more substantial role.

Brian Aherne and Joan Crawford were just wrong for the lead roles. Aherne simply lacked comedic skills and Crawford who was in her 30's did not fit the role of a spoiled rich teenager. However the costars were a joy and the reason to watch this movie. Granted this might and probably would be a classic with Gable and Lombard as the leads but the joy with this film is spending time with Arthur Treacher Frank Morgan Eric Blore and the wonderful Jessie Ralph. It would have been nice to see more of Ms. Ralph as she was terrific in her few scenes as the overbearing and inimitable grandmother. I simply enjoyed my time spent with Treacher and Blore bringing me a whiskey Morgan trembling around the females and Ms. Ralph ordering me about. Perhaps like me you too will enjoy time well spent with some of filmdom's greatest character actors.".

Granted this might and probably would be a classic with Gable and Lombard as the leads but the joy with this film is spending time with Arthur Treacher Frank Morgan Eric Blore and the wonderful Jessie Ralph. It would have been nice to see more of Ms. Ralph as she was terrific in her few scenes as the overbearing and inimitable grandmother. I simply enjoyed my time spent with Treacher and Blore bringing me a whiskey Morgan trembling around the females and Ms. Ralph ordering me about. Perhaps like me you too will enjoy time well spent with some of filmdom's greatest character actors.";

Brian Aherne is tall handsome gallant and completely believable as an academic trying to learn how to unwind rather like Cary Grant in BRINGING UP BABY three years later. Unlike Grant he hadn't the gifts of comic timing or of charm  there is something cranky and grudging about him and maybe this kept him from becoming a star despite his good looks.But this was a Joan Crawford vehicle it was tailored for her and it was she who was expected to carry it. As usual the broad strong face is as striking as a Modigliani sculpture but less expressive. Adrian the great MGM designer so closely associated with her is largely responsible for providing the illusion of presence and magnetism which Crawford didn't actually have. In this picture he gives her one of her most extreme and frankly ludicrous costumes and in upstaging her it exposes the essential flaw in their professional relationship.Adrian had wit as a designer and his costumes here are all amusing comments on Crawford's character but they expose rather than enhance her. The worst example seems meant to be a literal suit of armor since Crawford wears it in a scene in which her defensive selfconscious character realizes she loves Aherne but must give him up in order to save her father from financial reversals. It's rendered in what looks like silver lame with gigantic panels that fit over each shoulder open on the sides but completely obscuring her arms from the front  an armless Athena ready for battle. Less awful but still attentiongetting are a series of black suits and dresses which are cluttered with enormous starched white collars and bibs or exploding swags of stiff material suggesting stylized nun's habits. In contrast two simple costumes are far less theatrical but more effective in letting us examine Crawford A backless halter neck sailor suit is playful and sexy when she wears it without a bra in her first scene. And much later a starkly elegant white satin dressing gown proves to be more beautiful and glamorous than the two wedding gowns she also wears the second of which uses tiers of orange blossoms to cover up damage her spoiled heiress has done to it. The two pareddown costumes at least allow us to observe the actress and woman for ourselves to decide what we think of her. Little was required of Crawford in this period and she gave very little in return. And we have to wonder if Adrian tried to hide this or was in fact the cause of it Why should Crawford have learned to feel and act when her collars and sleeves upstaged her in every scene anyway?".

	schema:headline " Surprisingly good romantic comedy in spite of generic title.";
	schema:reviewBody "It's easy to see why Joan Crawford was one of the top box office draws of the mid 1930's. She was simply one of the most exquisitely beautiful and natural movie stars not a superb actress but purely ravishing in looks poise and personality. She sang and danced clowned and cried with conviction and audiences adored her. The masculine 1940's and 50's look was far off so here she is at her most appealing.This romantic comedy has Crawford as a madcap socialite traveling aboard her father's Frank Morgan private yacht around the Greek isles where she meets a struggling archaeologist Brian Aherne who thinks she's a secretary. Fate reveals the truth in New York when he meets her father and once all is revealed the sparks continue to fly. Aherne is one of Crawford's better romantic leads not a heman like Gable or dull like reallife hubby Franchot Tone but a likable masculine male who will not tolerate her nonsense yet would never bore her either.This isn't all champagne corks and society shindigs however. This delves into visions of the lives of the idle rich and how a working man could never tolerate such an existence particularly in the depression. When Aherne is made a vice president in the company run by Crawford's hardasnails granny the fabulous Jessie Ralph he goes ballistic as he realizes the pointlessness of it all and his title in name only position. Eric Blore and Arthur Treacher exchange some great sissy dialog as butlers of the different households and the always wonderful Aline MacMahon is fun as Aherne's assistant. There is also a fabulous Christmas sequence where the guest at the unseen Ralph's annual shindig sing one of the funniest versions of Silent Night ever heard on film.This has one of the wittiest screenplays of MGM's golden age outside a Thin Man movie with gems such as Morgan's retort to Aherne After all Rome wasn't burnt in a day! and Ralph's acceptance of Aherne when he fibs by telling her that his ancestors were horse thieves and pirates. Good Stock she says as she could in that truly inimitable vinegary way.".

	schema:reviewBody "MGM came up with a very predictable formula for Joan Crawford in the 1930s. Despite the films' limitations casting her as a poor girl worked well in the box office. In most of these films she wanted to marry a rich man and live a life of leisure but regardless of her aims she became known for playing her earthy ladies from workingclass roots. Despite this the studio worked against type and cast her as a rather shallow rich lady in I LIVE MY LIFEa role that seemed illsuited to her. On top of that the film really didn't seem well written as the characters often act in ways that make little sense.The film begins with Crawford and her clan on a yacht in the Greek Isles. Crawford goes to shore and meets an archaeologist Brian Aherne and they hit it off pretty well. However he says something about his prejudices against rich and shallow folks that's her in spades so she lies and tells him she's a secretarynot a pampered 'princess'. However after spending all this time with him she just leaveswithout telling him who she really is as she knows the relationship can't work.Later after she never answered any of his letters to her in America Aherne comes to the States to look for her. He soon finds out that she is NOT who she says she was so he digs deeper and eventually finds her in her mansion. They argue a lot and split. Then when he's giving a lecture in a nearby museum she arrivesto tell him how much she doesn't love him. Naturally this is a giant clich and soon they begin snogging for those not acquainted with 'British' this is KISSING. Soon they are preparing for a wedding!?.In the meantime Crawford's father Frank Morgan finds out his investments have gone bust and the family is in jeopardy of losing all their stuff so Crawford knows she can't marry Aherne but must marry a rich guy. Now considering that this film was made during the Depression the idea of Morgan or Crawford having to get a real job doesn't seem THAT awful. It was hard to care about some flibbertigibbet who has to vacate their mansion when the average American was pondering whether or not cat is the other white meat! So worrying about whether this brood can keep their wealth seems rather unimportant. So will Crawford marry Aherne or some other dude? Well instead she has the idea of having Aherne suck up to her grandmothermaybe she will give them the money they 'need' to bail out the family. So in other words she wants Aherne to become a manwhore. And once he gets a job from her where he gets to sit around and do nothing and collect a HUGE salary the audience is expected to feel sorry for him! As for all this nonsense does anyone care? Well as for me I didn't and had a hard time following this film to the endespecially since late in the film Crawford showed herself to be a total brat. In one scene she destroys thousands of dollars worth of things around the house and a designer dress!! Poor little pampered princess!I recommend this film only for completists who insist on seeing all of Crawford's filmsotherwise skip it. It's a sad shadow of her better films of the era. A sad misfire with an uninvolving plot and rather unlikable charactersaside from the crusty grandmother. This by the way is quite a waste as the film did have a great supporting cast consisting of Frank Morgan Arthur Treacher Eric Blore and Aline MacMahon.".

It's funny for 10 minutes then suddenly comedic with people changing attitudes and tone unconvincingly especially at the matriarch's house. Ending seems rushed and even Joan falls short in this one.

Have you heard of schizrophenic movie? that movie that cannot decide what it wants to be a comedy or a drama and as a joan of all movies it tries many but masters none. It's funny for 10 minutes then suddenly comedic with people changing attitudes and tone unconvincingly especially at the matriarch's house. Ending seems rushed and even Joan falls short in this one. Obviously an Aproduction with the usually sharp craftsman Woody Van Dyke behind the camera the whole buffoonery is a poor disappointment.";

But I was certainly glad to have finally caught up with it. As the plot unfolded it became obvious that this must have been originally a finely crafted stage play from the way it led you sympathetically from one character to another and kept you in complete suspense as to different possible denouements for the action. In fact it reminded me of some of Terrence Rattigan's finer plays. But now I see that the play was written by the wife? of Garson Kanin. I thoroughly agree with the first review that the romantic side of the plot though very touching was by no means all there was to it. Strong statements on wider issues such as academic freedom ability of big money to call the educational tune the growing up out of illusions which must be discarded very Ibsen or George Bernard Shaw all were pithily and dramatically dealt with and skillfully presented to the audience. The side roles especially Eve Arden were all brilliantly executed in that wisecracking zany style that made the plays of the 1920s and 30s such favorites. And the main leads Crawford Young etc were equally outstanding in their emotional portrayals. This film was at least 1015 years ahead of its time. When the 1960s finally rolled around American youth finally took the blinders off just the way Kanin and the makers of this film advocated. A brilliant and enthralling accomplishment. I wish we could all personally congratulate all the makers of this film of 50 years ago.".

I think she did an admirable job. My main problem is the story that we get weaves to an ending that's just...stupid...i dunno...I can't think of anything else to match how I feel.The basic outline is a congresswoman gets an invite to get an honorary degree at her old college that she was expelled from. She's happy to accept but at the same time an old boyfriend from the war turns up 5 years later as if he's still in her life. She obviously hasn't thought a thing about him but he just happens to be a Life magazine photographer and will be at the College to photograph the story.Well she accepts the honorary degree because the love of her life is the school president. Before they give her a degree they want to show a film of a speech she made but one of the main trustees of the college doesn't like it and wants it not to be shown. In the meantime she and the president decide to get married. She soon finds out that he's like all college presidents in that...he bows to the alumni pressure on things as they decide they want the film to not be shown. She doesn't like this because she sees that he's weak. By and by the old boyfriend keeps throwing jibes at her any time he can to break up her idea of him. She decides not to marry the president and get back together with the annoying guy who won't take no for an answer.This film was basically a backdrop for the communist witch hunt times. It was hot off the presses at the time this film was made. It's not a hidden plot in the film it's disguised a bit as free speech in education but to me the whole film hinged on the 3 leads and their personal issues...and she chooses the annoying guy who has nuthin but ill will in mind. How does this make women look? She chooses the guy that keeps harassing her? The president makes an error in not letting the speech be heard...but then decides to go ahead with it and she says...nah...but they remain friends. Gimme a break.It comes down to Crawfords character showed no interest in the guy she ends up with throughout the entire film. There's no leadin anywhere to show he would be the one she walks away with. This wasn't a bad film at all really. I just can't recommend a film with a really dumb ending like this.

It doesn't insult one's intelligence. It makes a passionate plea for free speech. Some would surely call it communist propaganda. Joan Crawford was however absurdly miscast as a flaming liberal politician. The real Joan was I think conservative. She ended her life as the chair of Pepsi! But somehow she captivates. Her diction is solid her acting measured always dignified and her movies are darn good she never played the Queen of Sheba or some other historic nonsense.  Robert Young is impeccable too far more impressive intelligent than a whole host of bigger stars but his nonmuscular persona confines him to the parlor. I can hardly believe he was an alcoholic.I thought STORM CENTER 1955 was the first free speech movie. Still the fact remains that STORM CENTER is more direct powerful dramatic and dashing. Unfortunately the censors seems to have had the last word about THAT anticensorship film. STORM CENTER has never been shown on TV as far as I know and it is not available on video. Something should be done to bring back this and other forgotten classics.".

It's really a story of how we remember people and how time changes them. The part and Joan aren't a perfect fit but she does try and does a decent job of it. As in Mildred Pierce she and Eve Arden interact wonderfully and their few scenes have a nice snap. Actually Joan's casting isn't the only one that seems off. While Robert Young is fine as the conflicted college president Frank Lovejoy is wrong as the inquisitive reporter. He was a good tough guy actor but Robert Montgomery or Clark Gable would have been more suitable the part is the second lead so neither would have considered it. Someone who is perfectly cast however is the wonderful Lurene Tuttle as the seemingly simpleminded college chum of Joan. She is funny and touching and steals any scene she's in with ease. The film does have a message about being true to your ideals but is mostly a bittersweet romance and an enjoyable one at that.".

She's invited by college president and former boyfriend Robert Young.There's a lot of history here and this is the only degree she'll have from the College Of New Hope for women located in rural New England. Back in the day apparently Crawford was a wild child at least wild by those standards back then. She got into a compromising situation with Young and she took the fall by herself and got expelled for it. In the interim Young in addition to rising to the presidency of the college married a woman who died and has a daughter Janice Rule who is going to be one of the graduates at the ceremony Crawford gets her degree.Crawford went into journalism and then politics. She's combining the two at this point having produced a documentary about the current social problems of Europe and how Fascism by curtailing free speech contributed mightily to them. She's hoping to show the film while she's at the college. Her opponent in this endeavor is the chairman of the board Howard St. John who also happens to be now married to Crawford's former roommate Lurene Tuttle. He's got the part that actors like Eugene Palette and Charles Dingle normally were cast in the arrogant self righteous right wing blowhard who thinks he ought to be controlling the educational process. Not that he's against free speech mind you but he feels that kids should not be exposed to this kind of serious work. He in fact donated the campus movie theater and he'd like for them to show entertainment that he approves of such as his favorites AbbottCostello.Young's dependent on St. John's good will for his job. But one who isn't and is also a rival for Crawford is Frank Lovejoy a TimeLife war photographer who is covering this event. He'll expose Young's timidity if for no other reason than to shame him in front of Joan.Goodbye My Fancy was written by Fay Kanin and ran for 446 performances on Broadway during the 194849 season and was directed by Sam Wanamaker who also played the Frank Lovejoy part. The college president was played by another former movie name Conrad Nagel. The play took home a Tony Award for Shirley Booth who played Crawford's Congressional aide and has some really funny Eve Arden type lines. When the film came out the Eve Arden part was played by Eve Arden.The play draws heavily on themes expressed in James Thurber's The Male Animal. If anything it's more serious here because whereas in The Male Animal trustee Eugene Palette objected to the content in reading Nicolo Sacco's letter in class St. John just objects to the idea of material that is mind challenging in the classroom in general. What does this imbecile think they're going to college for. In fact there's a minor role played by Morgan Farley as a physics professor who is intending to leave the college because of the limits he's being put under and Farley plays it well.Coming out as it did during the House UnAmerican Activities Committee days and after Joe McCarthy started finding Communists in all kinds of places Goodbye My Fancy was quite the courageous project for Warner Brothers at the time. It's a timeless tribute to the value of free speech and the marketplace of ideas that a university is supposed to be.This is a film that I think needs a remake. Can you see some trustee on a university today throwing his weight around and maybe filling the campus cinema with reruns of Saturday Night Live in order that students not concentrate on serious issues?I think it could be done.".

Madeleine Carroll starred.Crawford in 1951 was 44 and in those days after an actress turned 30 she went into supporting roles. It's to Crawford's credit that she stayed a leading lady well past 30 albeit in lesser films.This film is actually a good one. Crawford plays a Congresswoman Agatha Reed who is invited back to her old college to receive an honorary degree. She is thrilled for more than one reason. She has happy memories there and has never forgotten her old love and though she doesn't state it she's hoping to see him again. Also she finds it amusing that she's been invited  she was expelled from the school for staying out all night and didn't graduate.Agatha and her able assistant Eve Arden travel to the college dogged the entire way by a photographer Frank Lovejoy with whom Agatha had an involvement a few years back.Agatha has filmed a documentary that she wants to show at the school. The film is about what happens when people are denied their freedoms and deals with book burnings persecution of teachers etc. She is shocked to find that there is some question as to whether or not the film will be shown.Goodbye My Fancy is about going home again and underneath Agatha having two men interested in her it makes a statement about McCarthyism which was so rampant at the time. It's also about standing up for what you believe in and having integrity  true ethics kick in when you've got something to lose.I saw some comments about Crawford being miscast  I'm not sure why  she played strong career women for many years. The casting is off but it's not Crawford. It's partly the script and partly the casting. Robert Young is very good as the President  handsome charming and formal. Eve Arden is funny as the assistant wisecracking her way through the role. Shirley Booth played the role on Broadway.The role that's miscast is Frank Lovejoy as Matt Cole. The role called for a macho attractive tough guy and instead we get the rather sloppy wisecracking Lovejoy. The ending of the film seemed to come out of nowhere.Otherwise fairly enjoyable good cast.".

	schema:reviewBody "Although I gave this film a 7 last time around I was still a bit harsh about it. Now having watched it a second time my 7 will remain but I'm going to chill out a bit about the film.Here a brash Congresswoman Crawford Agatha Reed returns to her alma mater to receive an honorary degree although her prime motive is to rekindle an old romance with the college president Robert Young. But a reporter is after her too Frank Lovejoy.It's not the Mommie Dearest thing but  particularly this late in her career  I have a difficult time seeing Joan Crawford as a sentimental character or even being in a romantic comedy. But Crawford comes across pretty well in the other half of her role here a Congresswoman. So. it's a balance.Having Crawford as a brass Congresswoman is just about enough brashness for any film but here we also have  as her secretary  Eve Arden. Arden excelled at being brash and is no less so here. And only she could have pulled this off without the film going overboard in the brashness department.In a way it almost seems to me that Robert Young was trying out his Father Knows Best persona here...just 3 years before that iconic role came his way. I enjoy him here this is one of his better performances.It's a little difficult to understand why a mellow Young would be so attracted to the brash Congresswoman here. That's one of my biggest problems with this film. She seems more suited to Frank Lovejoy's newspaperman character...but of course in real life they'd almost certainly end up in a divorce court a few years down the road.There's an interesting subplot about a teacher's freedom to teach students to think...although it falls flat at the end of the film...seems to have been forgotten about. The bottom line here for me was why this film grates on me a bit. And I think I finally figured it out. Joan Crawford as a Congresswoman...well maybe. But Joan Crawford fighting for education and freedom and democracy? I just can't buy that. Pretty good movie but terribly miscast in terms of Crawford. And her eyes drive me crazy...spooky!. Well worth watching it...once. Oops. Guess I should say twice.".

Tame by today's standards I'm glad to see that Joan was not scared to throw some mud in the eye of the evil McCarthy witch hunt. in real life Joan did testify at the McCarthy hearings and basically told them to go to hell but in a nice way only Joan could pull off. Don't write this movie off it is now available on DVD through Movies Unlimited as is Joan's last picture for Warners This Women Is Dangerous.

But it was refreshing to see Joan playing a part in her own age range instead of trying to pass for younger and more beautiful as she had been doing for most of her parts since turning forty. This is a soft drama with a few comedic touches about a congresswoman Joan who returns to her college to receive an honorary degree. Actually she really returns to see old beau Robert Young now the president of the college. She's followed along by her annoying reporter ex that's in love with her.Crawford's performance is mixed. Most of the time she's solid but there are scenes where she acts like she's never been in a movie before. Particularly the more sentimental scenes. Young is good even with the added gray to his hair and the mustache designed to make him appear older. Robert Lovejoy is terrible. His character type  the guy who won't take no for an answer but if he just keeps pushing eventually the woman will give in  is a gross one that unfortunately popped up often in older films. Modern day stalkers must watch movies like this and long for the old days when no meant yes. I couldn't stand this obnoxious ahole. The saving grace of the film is Eve Arden. How many times has that been the case? If I made a list of great actresses who played supporting parts but should have been leading ladies she would be number one. The only bad thing I'll say about her is this Eve and Joan were apparently having a worst hair contest in this movie and Eve won. Anyway this is a poor effort with few bright spots and a huge downer of a romantic plot.".

Says Congresswoman Reed The housewife has been getting it in the neck too long. I'm going to keep fighting long enough so that the American family can take a vacation once a year see a movie every week and feed an occasional peanut to an elephant. She's all business but becomes all gushy when she is awarded an honorary degree from Good Hope College where she was expelled for the crime of having stayed out all night the parallel to Joan's real life is unmistakable here as it is in all Joan Movies. The degree causes much consternation on campus That would make it the most broadminded institution in the history of education!  but Joan is unaware of this as she arrives. The college president Jim Merrill played by Robert Young at his handsomest happens to be Joan's former teacher  and lover. It was with him that she spent the night out all those years ago but Joan felt it was better to just disappear rather than try and explain to the skeptical college that they were about to be married. Naturally this highprofile event will be covered by Life magazine  and who does the photographer turn out to be? Yet another of Joan's old lovers  this one she hung out with in China during the war and he thinks Joan might be headed for trouble with her old flame. Eve Arden playing Joan's assistant Woodie is at her butchest and most smartalecky in this movie  with her flippant and unnecessary remarks that would make you dismiss her from her job if you didn't like her so much. But you not only like Eve in this as in all her roles you adore her. She is so droll and nononsense you'd like to pay her just to hang around and be one of the boys. When Joan cries upon arriving at her alma mater Eve tells her it looks fierce. But Joan says that maybe others only see a collection of buildings she Joan sees youth  herself at 18 eager expectant  a little frightened asking 'What is life? What am I?' But of course if we actually go into depth about Joan at 18 the truth may be a little different. For me this is the major problem in watching any Joan movie. You can call her characters whatever you want to but it's always all Joan all the time. So since what we're always seeing is Joan being herself it's easy to dispense with character's names. It's just that it gets confusing when Joan tries to tell us something patently untrue like her description of herself at 18  when we know that at 18 Joan had already been around the block several times. Many men would have described her as eager and as far as being expectant she had already had several abortions at this point. But that's a personal problem and I digress but I simply wanted to explain why I say things such as and then Joan does this or that or We see Joan as... when we are not literally watching a home movie.There is an unintentionally hilarious moment in which Joan is given the Clara Bow doll that she left behind in college  quick arithmetic tells us that Joan and Clara were contemporaries and this is a transparent ploy to make us believe Joan is much younger than she actually looks. It fails. What also fails is an attempt at early50s political correctness. In the story Joan has written a book about free speech and made a film no not the one about the plumber and she attracts the attention of an early 50s campus radical Dr. Pitt who is about to be fired for his views which are shockingly similar to Joan's. This is where the movie mysteriously becomes a morality tale a weak one to be sure but perhaps the only thing that keeps it from sliding into oblivion.".

	schema:reviewBody "Goodbye My Fancy 1951  12 out of 4Rather bizarre and uneven mix of comedy and drama features congresswoman Agatha Reed Joan Crawford going back to her college to receive an honorary degree. Her main reason for wanting to go back is so she can see a former love Robert Young who she was expelled from school for sneaking out to see. Once back on campus she ends up caught between him and a photographer Frank Lovejoy. GOODBYE MY FANCY has pretty much been forgotten over the years and it's easy to see why because it's really not part of Crawford's high standards which she started six years earlier with MILDRED PIERCE and followed with some very impressive bits of work. This film here is mildly entertaining on a few levels but overall you've got to consider it a pretty disappointing picture. One of the biggest problems is that it runs 106minutes and probably could have lost a good sixteenminutes if not more. I say this because there's just so much going on in this picture and with so much happening the film just seems too long and uneven. The early portion of the film makes you think that we're in for some sort of weird comedy and we're given various silly scenes. Then the film because a rather bland romanticcomedy but things change yet again when we get a rather long political debate about freedom. I think the final twentyfive minutes or so are actually the best part of the film as the Crawford character tries to fight to get a film shown that tells young people some of the horrors that are out there. As for Crawford she turns in a good performance but there's certainly nothing all that memorable here. This is the type of role should could do without trying but it's always nice seeing her. Young is pretty bland in his role but thankfully Lovejoy adds some energy when he's on screen. Eve Arden is good as the secretary and Janice Rule is also nice as Young's daughter. GOODBYE MY FANCY really isn't going to appeal to many except for Crawford fans wanting to see everything she did.".

	schema:reviewBody "While this picture ranks as a pretty heady Joan Crawford fantasy this picture is NOT Joan! It is however Joan as she wanted to be seen  younger than her peer Clara Bow glamorous caring about mothers and constituents and others and hopelessly romantic. Truth be known her only care for others was for her fans  that they continued to write her to adore her to idolize what they believed to be her! Only one other reviewer tells the truth about the tawdry life of Joan before she was 18 none tells of the continuance of that life when she embarked on Hollywood and had her three or four careers there. That same reviewer incidentally is the only one who mentions that Goodbye My Fancy was a hit play before it fell into the clutches of La Crawford so while its premise and material might be heady for behindthetimes Hollywood Broadway and the road had seen and enjoyed the play for a while before Hollywood tackled it!

It is however Joan as she wanted to be seen  younger than her peer Clara Bow glamorous caring about mothers and constituents and others and hopelessly romantic. Truth be known her only care for others was for her fans  that they continued to write her to adore her to idolize what they believed to be her! Only one other reviewer tells the truth about the tawdry life of Joan before she was 18 none tells of the continuance of that life when she embarked on Hollywood and had her three or four careers there. That same reviewer incidentally is the only one who mentions that Goodbye My Fancy was a hit play before it fell into the clutches of La Crawford so while its premise and material might be heady for behindthetimes Hollywood Broadway and the road had seen and enjoyed the play for a while before Hollywood tackled it!

	schema:reviewBody "This is certainly not one of the more famous films made by Joan Crawford in her long career but I wish it was because in many ways she parodies the hard as nails image she strongly cultivated in films. The movie begins with the fascistlike Crawford at a board meeting for a corporation she heads. You can tell right away that she is the stereotypical hard working sex loathing female image common in some 1940s films. In fact in many ways she seems like a 1940s version of Scroogethough perhaps a bit less likable!! Into this rigid and careerdriven world arrives Melvin Douglasa writer who is doing a book on the way this corporation mistreats the employees. Crawford is angered by this but considering it's all true and her actions fuel the fire there isn't much she can do. Douglas also enjoys baiting and irritating Crawfordonce again because she makes this so much fun! In many ways this film is reminiscent of the wonderful DEVIL AND MISS JONES as later Crawford attends an employee function and is accepted with open armsbecause they have no idea she's their hated boss! And like this other film it's a good comedy with plenty to make audiences happy. The only serious deficit is that the ending is drawn out way too long and could have benefited from a trimming.All the actors were just fine though I was particularly impressed by Bilie Burke's supporting role. Unlike most of her films she was much more restrained and less annoying than usualthis time she was a very welcome addition.By the way a few final observations. First when the doctor was describing the symptoms of falling in love he actually described symptoms of schizophrenia! Also there is a mistake in that the alarm that CONSTANTLY goes off at night on the trucks only occurs at the beginning of the film. Later at the same time of night the alarm is strangely silent.".

And like this other film it's a good comedy with plenty to make audiences happy. The only serious deficit is that the ending is drawn out way too long and could have benefited from a trimming.All the actors were just fine though I was particularly impressed by Bilie Burke's supporting role. Unlike most of her films she was much more restrained and less annoying than usualthis time she was a very welcome addition.By the way a few final observations. First when the doctor was describing the symptoms of falling in love he actually described symptoms of schizophrenia! Also there is a mistake in that the alarm that CONSTANTLY goes off at night on the trucks only occurs at the beginning of the film. Later at the same time of night the alarm is strangely silent.";

Michael sets his eyes on business woman Margaret Drew Joan Crawford who runs several companies surrounding truck drivers. As Michael begins to crack her business practices the woman finds herself having feelings unlike ever before. THEY ALL KISSED THE BRIDE has sadly been forgotten over the years since it's been rather hard to see but the movie is certainly worth being rediscovered for a number of reasons. It's worth noting that this movie was originally meant for Carole Lombard but that star was killed shortly before the film went into production so Crawford asked to take over the role in respect. MGM let her go to rival Columbia for this picture and legend has it that the actress gave her salary to the Red Cross. Back to the film it's certainly a very entertaining little gem that is pretty silly but at the same time the cast just makes it so much fun. Crawford was extremely good in the type of role that clearly wasn't written for her. I thought she did a good job with the tough boss role but also during the comedy bits when they'd come along. There's a running gag dealing with her getting weak at the knees and she makes this very funny. Douglas is also extremely good in his part and there's no question that the two stars do a fine job playing off one another. Allen Jenkins adds some good comedy as a truck driver and we also get nice turns by Billie Burke and Roland Young. The film actually has quite a few funny scenes but the most memorable is one where Jenkins is drunk and just grabs Crawford and throws her onto the dance floor. The high speed that they're dancing is quite impressive but more so is the fact that Crawford keeps a straight face throughout the whole thing.".

	schema:headline " And Then Joan Crawford Loosens Up!";
	schema:reviewBody "There's much more to They All Kissed the Bride than the silly and misleading title would lead one to believe. Some brief background on the production seems necessary since this is the movie that Carole Lombard was slated to make before her tragic death. So her husband's former costar Joan Crawford then offered to replace her and actually donated her salary for the role to the American Red Cross. I'm certain that Crawford felt she was slumming it at Columbia after so many years at MGM but the studio did fine by their treatment of her.This was another Crawford movie which was totally unfamiliar to me and was part of a recent June Brides marathon run on TCM. I started to watch it with some trepidation but soon found myself really enjoying this lively little romance which contains some genuinely big laughs. The plot seems lifted almost from Sam Wood's The Devil and Miss Jones from the previous year only with the sexes reversed. Crawford plays the president of her family's trucking firm and is a hardheaded businesswoman who suffers no fools even in her somewhat nonexistent private life. Melvyn Douglas is a muckraking journalist exposing the ruthlessness of Crawford's company policies but one who always makes time for a little fun often fueled by cocktails. After a series of mistaken identities Douglas takes Crawford on a journey of self discovery thanks to the proletariat. Yeah the plot may be predictable and there are a few dead ends for some of the supporting characters but the main result is a pleasant and humorous  if somewhat slight  experience. In fact there is one scene where Crawford dances an outrageously wild jitterbug with Allen Jenkins that's worth the price of admission alone. It makes the one done by Bette Davis in Thank Your Lucky Stars look like a cakewalk! And certainly Joan Crawford rises to occasion here and fills the role of a romantic leading lady here in a comedy that's close to screwball. She looks fantastic and wears the highest of 1940's fashions with great panache. She also proves that she could be as light and cheery as her many contemporaries who were more famous for their comedic ability.And finally I don't think I'm giving away a spoiler but Joan Crawford never dons a wedding gown in this. Apparently it's her younger sister who's the titular Bride and her wedding occurs in the first half hour and she subsequently disappears on a honeymoon. So here's one that's not only for Joan Crawford completists but for all fans of classic 40's comedy.".

She also proves that she could be as light and cheery as her many contemporaries who were more famous for their comedic ability.And finally I don't think I'm giving away a spoiler but Joan Crawford never dons a wedding gown in this. Apparently it's her younger sister who's the titular Bride and her wedding occurs in the first half hour and she subsequently disappears on a honeymoon. So here's one that's not only for Joan Crawford completists but for all fans of classic 40's comedy.";

Instead of the sterile and talky duds that weighed down Crawford's career this offthebeatentrack entry contains moments of genuine comic imagination of the wacky variety.

	schema:reviewBody "Yukio Noda's 'Zero WomanRed Handcuffs' lives up to it's reputation featuring a truly impressive level of violence mixed in with it's artistic style. I made the mistake of trying to watch this one in the morning. I had to stop it during the scene where a gang member is getting his skin burned off with a blowtorch by a police detective. When I watched it all the way through I found this to be a very impressive 'pink' film dealing with revenge kidnapping and torture. A gang of thugs who get their kicks raping and killing random people believe they hit the big time when they kidnap the daughter of an important political figure. The amazingly sexy and tough Miki Sugimoto the Zero Woman is hired to bring back the girl and to her delight she is given an order to leave none of the kidnappers alive. This sets up the stage for some truly impressive scenes of brutality and Rei the Zero Woman has an almost religious devotion to 'justice'. We see this at the films amazing first sequence where she allows herself to be taken to a hotel room by a wanted rapistkiller and hands out her own brand of 'justice'. One reason that the film is so disturbing is that everyone including the cops is portrayed as wild animals with no compassion for human life. The gang especially seem like a pack of savage hyenas. And much of the violence is directed at the Zero Woman herself she is on the receiving end of many beatings and ugly rapes. I actually felt a little queasy in the stomach at times but Miki Sugimoto is a gorgeous heroine pure eye candy and this visual beauty made the films ugly scenes a bit more bearable. Not that 'Zero Woman' is an ugly looking film This is filmed with a great level of style and utilizes garish colors especially well. Rei sports a red gun and red handcuffs and the whole thing is quite surreal. This is the only thing that i have seen from director Yukio Noda but judging from this one the guy is a maniac. 'Zero Womanred Handcuffs' is a fine 'pink film' and should not be confused with the vastly inferior 'Zero Woman' trash films from the 90's. This 1974 classic has absolutely nothing in common with those later films other than the name. Essential viewing for fans of 'pink' cinema and violent cop dramas this is a real assault on the senses!".

Given a chance at redemption she is brought back on a secret mission to rescue a high ranking politician's played by the legendary Tetsuro Tanba daughter from a gang of crazed rapists.All hell breaks loose once she's undercover and the blood clothes and Red Handcuffs start flying! In order to keep her cover she must endure everything this sick gang of psychos can throw at her. Keeping cool she stays close to the kidnapped girl and close to her weapon of choice while waiting for her opportunity to strike. Climaxing in a blood filled showdown in a windy deserted Navy base this film is a nonstop ride from beginning to end. The video quality and packaging are top notch. Inside the limited slip cover is an alternate cover that features some of the nastier and naughtier scenes. I've read that these limited versions will be sold out very soon and the packaging won't be duplicated once gone. Highly recommended and a musthave for fans of Japanese cinema!".

	schema:reviewBody "As an enthusiastic fan of Japanese exploitation cinema from the 70s I was full of anticipation to see Yukio Noda's Zeroka no onna Akai wappa aka. Zero Woman Red Handcuffs and the film certainly deserves its cult status. Zero Woman Red Handcuffs is an extremely violent and sleazy exploitation gem that even surpassed my expectations. The film which stars the ravishing exploitation goddess Miki Sugimoto as the eponymous heroine is explicit from the very beginning. Gory murders rapes tortures and all kinds of sleaze and sexual violence are omnipresent in the film and yet the film has way more to offer than only gore and sleaze as it is immensely stylish and brilliant in all respects. The incredibly sexy Miki Sugimoto is great in the lead as Rei aka. Zero Woman a beautiful female undercover cop who is assigned to infiltrate and eliminate gang of sadistic and perverted criminals who have kidnapped the daughter of a prominent politician... I will not go into detail any further as I don't want to spoil any of the fun but I can assure that Zero Woman Red Handcuffs is a mustsee for every fan of Japanese exploitation cinema.The film is based on the manga comics by Tooru Shinohara who also created the manga series that the brilliant Joshuu Sasori aka. Female Prisoner Scorpion films are based on. The film has a delightfully black sense of humor and an enormous level of sleaze and violence even for Japanese 70s exploitation standards. The camera work is excellent and the supporting cast includes several familiar faces for Japanese cinema fans such as Tetsuro Tamba or Yko Mihara who is known for her female bully characters most prominently in Shunya Ito's exploitation masterpiece Joshuu 701g Sasori aka. Female Prisoner 701 Scorpion 1972 the first of the brilliant 'Sasori' films. The funky score in Zero Woman Red Handcuffs is also very good even if it admittedly resembles the score of the 'Sasori' films a lot especially the theme song performed by star Miki Sugimoto is very similar to the Sasoritheme 'Urami Bushi' sung by Meiko Kaji. The great Toei Company released quite a number of excellent exploitation films in the 70s and Zero Woman Red Handcuffs is one of them. A bunch of new Zero Woman films none of which I've seen so far were released in the 90s but they can't possibly reach the greatness of this 1974 original. Zero Woman Red Handcuffs has everything great exploitation cinema needs lots of sleaze and female nudity an enormous dose of violence and gore all brought to you with immense style and a supercool and stunningly beautiful heroine played by the sexy Miki Sugimoto. In short This is exploitationgold and an absolute mustsee for all lovers of cultcinema! Awesome!".

While not as sleazy as something like Terrifying Girls Highschool or as exhilarating fun as Girl Boss Guerilla fans of the genre will not be disappointed. It's very bloody it has the requisite rape and nudity scenes that make any film of this sort work and just enough of a plot to keep you from glancing at your watch. It kind of drags in the middle but makes up for it with a blistering final act that involves among other things blood gushing from gunshot wounds a man burnt to a crisp and handcuff strangling.One of the problems I had with it is that the first scene establishes Rei as this ubercool badass cop chick with a style all her own red handcuffs gun and overcoat. A comicbook character that you can see kicking all sorts of butts. But then for the next hour she becomes this very passive character that gets tossed around and abused by a bunch of hoodlums. She's obviously trying to be as Meiko Kaji circa Lady Snowblood as possible cold stare silent all that but I like her better when she goes wild. All in all a decent pinku with a central character that could have been a lot better but enough gore and sleaze to keep me happy. There's also a cameo by Tetsuro Tamba.".

It kind of drags in the middle but makes up for it with a blistering final act that involves among other things blood gushing from gunshot wounds a man burnt to a crisp and handcuff strangling.One of the problems I had with it is that the first scene establishes Rei as this ubercool badass cop chick with a style all her own red handcuffs gun and overcoat. A comicbook character that you can see kicking all sorts of butts. But then for the next hour she becomes this very passive character that gets tossed around and abused by a bunch of hoodlums. She's obviously trying to be as Meiko Kaji circa Lady Snowblood as possible cold stare silent all that but I like her better when she goes wild. All in all a decent pinku with a central character that could have been a lot better but enough gore and sleaze to keep me happy. There's also a cameo by Tetsuro Tamba.";

Noda directs like his life depends on it and throws in a giddy amount of dutch tilts gorgeously framed closeups and crashing zooms that always enhance the material. Yoshio Nakajima's cinematography has a fiery roughedged ultrarich look to it and the score is packed with energy. Special mention must also go to the gory makeup effects of burnt bodies exploding chests and smashes skulls.This amazing work goes a couple of steps further than almost every other film of its genre and stands as an alltime great.True exploitation fans will appreciate its bloody magic.".

Zero Woman's police tactics seem to include being beaten and raped until the point she can pull out the deadly red handcuffs. The criminals are crazed and the politicianscops are crooked and conniving. What a wonderful world. Much of the film is set in sleazy areas or abandoned neighborhoods giving the film an atmosphere much like Mad Max. Sometimes the colors are vivid to the point of unreality. At one point the director does some very unusual color lighting tricks that work well. Depending on your stomach this is a very well made exploitation film.The weak points are the ridiculous flying handcuffs that do things that would be unacceptable in a cheap kung fu picture what was easy to draw in the original manga was obviously hard to reproduce in real life. And the big car chaseshootout that looks like they are driving 15 miles per hour. The lead actress is very good and has no problem delivering serious lines unclothed. The other actors are good or hammy in a way that fits with the over the top tone of the film.Recommended for hard exploitation fans.".

Editing is as experimental as in other Japanese movies of the time  sometimes the sound disappears sometimes it comes back you got zooms and jump cuts and rotating cameras but in the same time you got also a true story that despite its chaotic aspect is quite good and nihilistic. Part of the antiAmerican thing is a little bit boring but the movie is so graphic so full of energy so original so beautiful and the music so brilliant that we have to consider this as a masterpiece.

When a public political figure's daughter is raped and kidnapped by a group of hoods Zero is offered a chance to redeem herself..by infiltrating their gang assassinating them and retrieving the girl. It will not be easy considering their leader was just recently released from prison and is clearly unstable..his face often twists into a homicidal rage when completely provoked. We witness just how uncontrollable his mania can be when a young member of his gang attempts to help their prisoner escape bashing a bottle over the kid's head as blood squirts from the wounds. Zero is able to earn the gang leader's trust by helping him escape the clutches of cops who had him surrounded getting access into the brotherhood but suffers through a series of sexual attacks and physical abuse while holding an amazing resolve focused on the task at hand. Meanwhile Zero's boss President Nagumo's man in charge follows the leads she provides accompanied by a host of cops who plan to do what's necessary to quiet any type of possible scandal. If the idea that a scandal might come out Nagumo will order the unthinkable to help his political career remain untainted. Zero may very will have to not only contend with the unhinged group of thugs but those who hired her just so that a politician can keep his life free of scandal.One thing's for certain director Yukio Koda knows how to deliver brisk action setpieces featuring startling amounts of bloody violence. There's a definite amount of unpleasant sexual abuse towards female victims thanks in part to the nasty gang who often attack on a whim..in fact they only discover that they have raped and kidnapped the daughter of a major political giant only after consulting their sis SesumYko Miharawho provides them with a place to stay..she's also one of the prisoners who attacks Zero in the opening. We see how unpredictable they can be when they besiege a group of school girls studying for a Shakespearian play raping and abusing them in a very hostile manner even setting the house on fire with them tied up and unable to escape. Miki Sugimoto is a rock of strength an icequeen avenger who is able to withstand quite a bit of punishment because of her profound devotion to fulfilling her duty as required. She's also stunningly beautiful and carries a confident cool disposition which defines many heroine undercover assassins in Japanese action crime thrillers. The use of the red handcuffs is preposterous..Zero is able to throw the cuffs locking whatever body part she so wishes as if a magician with an unprecedented marksman's skill. Lots of thick textured blood pours from bullet riddled wounds during shootouts and the hand cuffs even stab a throat causing gushing red. A pretty cringeworthy torture scene also occurs as we witness techniques used to coerce information from one amongst the group..using a blow torch vicegrip and water hose. This is over all far less disturbing than it could've been because of how director Koda lenses the attacks cleverly showing less than appears yet still stirring up a reaction from the viewer. Such as the rapes you witness the clothes ripped away but Koda is able to keep actual penetration away from the screen yet you still feel the intensity and terror felt by the victims and the despicable thrill captured on the faces of the tormentors. Shooting in some incredibly difficult angles Koda also impresses with his impeccable camerawork. Despite familiar trappings we are accustomed to..undercover operation to get a victim out of the hands of criminals using a cop with unorthodox methods Koda films it all with style and skill.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not big on Asian cinema but I went into this film with high expectations anyway considering all that I'd heard about it and the film certainly didn't disappoint! It reminded me a lot of the Mario Bava masterpiece and fellow 1974 release Rabid Dogs and it's interesting to consider the difference in style between what are probably the world's two biggest cult film producing nations the films handle similar topics yet the style and execution couldn't be much more different. Zero Woman Red Handcuffs is an exploitation thriller with themes of comedy action and horror thrown into the mix. The central themes are rape kidnap and murder and the film excellently blurs the lines between the good and bad guys. The central character is Rei a lady cop who finds herself in jail after murdering an American diplomat as an act of revenge. Shortly afterwards a politician's daughter is raped and after realising who she is the rapists turn kidnappers and hold the girl for ransom. The Government then has no choice but to send Rei in to kill the gang and rescue the girl...The film kicks off with a gory cold blooded murder sequence and less than five minutes later there's a brutal rape sequence which gives a good impression of what this film is all about! Director Yukio Noda really doesn't hold back where violence or blood is concerned and the film features several brutal scenes most of which result in heavy blood loss  the spraying blood effect is a particular highlight! The central role of course goes to the beautiful Miki Sugimoto who plays the 'zero woman' of the title. She's a very cool character and looks awesome chewing scenery in her long red coat although I have to say that she becomes a bit of a disappointment as the film goes on  considering her introduction sequence the character would have been put to much better use if she were given the upper hand over the kidnappers rather than being constantly beaten down. Her weapon of choice is a pair of red handcuffs which she somehow manages to kill people with...the result being 'interesting'. The mellow music really tops the film off providing a stark contrast to the on screen action. Overall this is not a perfect film by any means but its good gory fun and certainly comes recommended to my fellow cult fans!".

One night at a nightclub she makes the acquaintance of a foreigner who buys her several drinks and then takes her to his apartment room where he intends on dispatching her in the same manner he murdered his other victim. Fortunately she turns the tables on him and kills him first. Unfortunately when it is discovered that the man was a foreign dignitary the police chief decides to throw her into prison without a trial or charges being preferred to avoid a possible scandal. Her situation changes however when the daughter of the incoming Prime Minister is kidnapped and Rei's services are required to rescue her at all costs. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a provocative crimedrama which featured plenty of action along with two attractive actresses in Hiromi Kishi as the Prime Minister's daughter Kyoko Nagumo and the aforementioned Miki Sugimoto. On the flip side some of the acting was a bit overthetop as were some of the special effects as well. I should probably also mention that this is an extremely violent film which had several brutal scenes involving rape and nudity which might not appeal to all audiences. In any case it's an interesting movie and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'd loved Preparations for a Festival which had Miki Sugimoto in a key role. Zero Woman I expected to be better. This is an utterly ludicrous film. There is Ms.Sugimoto as some weird cop who has her own methods of producing justice fair enough. What this means is she's a twotrick pony she allows herself to be disrobed off her beautifullyiconic red dress and lets rip a magical red handcuff at her victims. Apart from that she just smolders says practically nothing and watches over some of the most inhuman acts as if she can't be bothered with lives of extras or her own. The plot is nonsensical and like the filmmakers let's not go there. Instead let's focus on why I gave it 6 stars. Miki Sugimoto is excellent in a role where she has something to do and say for about 3 minutes. The rest of the time she is just there looking pretty. She does those 3 minutes and the rest very well indeed. I feel she would have done a good job in mainstream roles too had she had the opportunity and desire. But this is her turf and she mixes anger and gorgeous quite well. The other thing that works is the filmmaking itself. Ignore the story and script and you have dare I say a very interesting piece of art. Some of the scenes are just so powerful. There is a particularly brutal scene which Yukio Noda cuts and shoots in a way that is eyeopening. The use of freeze frames and other visual tools make it a worthwhile exercise to just study some of them as individual vignettes. I wish this had a better story and a less contemptuous plot.".

Meiko Kaji was the original Princess Blade which was also based on a comic by Kazuo Kamimura so you can see that Zero Woman has its roots in very edgy comic book genre.Screen play was done by Fumio Kounami who also did the screen play for Sasori and director is Yukio Noda is the one who did most of the delinquent themed movies for the Toei studio. With all the right characters in place this movie was made to satisfy the adult audience of Japan at the time.Zero Woman is a story about a lady cop who holds nothing back to get her job done including having sex with the criminal. In the Japanese police force ichika The first division is the homicide division. Then nika second division sanka third division has other specialized fields of investigation. Zeroka zero division of course does not exist in the real Japanese police force. It's a fictitious creation by Shinohara that handles assignments that needs to be taken care of covertly. Mio Miki Sugimoto is the only investigator in this division.Mio was framed by her superiors and was sent to jail on a bad wrap for killing the culprit of the unsolved crime that ended in the death of her friend Amy. Around the same time Kyoko  a daughter of next prime minister candidate Zengo Nagumo was raped and captured by a gang run by Nakahara. Nakahara discovering that Kyoko is Zengo's daughter decides to blackmail Zengo for 30 million yen. Hearing about this Mio's superiors decides to use Mio as an undercover detective to infiltrate Nakahara's gang. Since wide spread scandal would be ruinous to Nagumo's career gag order has been laid so no information about the investigation will leak out. To solve the case in secrecy Mio is ordered to rescue Kyoko and kill all the members of the gang so they wouldn't talk.Toei studio made many good adult themed movies in the '70s. Some actually became bona fide classics such as Princess Snowblood School of Holy Beast Jeans Blues and this one. The concept was good enough that remake has been made in recent years. This is the original and although bit cheesy by today's standard is very good for Asian movie of that era compare this to some of the Shaw Brothers movies from the same era and you'll know what I mean. This movie is filled with exciting scenes depicting the under belly of Japanese society.This is a fun movie and is recommended for anyone who's a fan of Asian cinema.".

Having watched and enjoyed all of the Pinky Violence dvds that have been made available with English subtitles Zero Woman Red Handcuffs has got to be the worst in this genre that I've seen. It is not just a weak entry in the genre but a very weak film in general.The redeeming points? This being a Pinky Violence film you do get your share of blood mayhem and T  A. But they hardly make up for the excruciating pain you are about to go through.First the acting is bad. Not the kind where it makes you laugh but the kind that makes you cringe and is very painful and awkward to watch. I'm all for bad lousy acting when it's campy but this is not. They look like they are actually TRYing to act badly.The film is very choppy and a lot of what went on was rather unnecessary and makes no sense at all. Again many exploitation films make little sense but this is just too much. Nothing makes sense in the film.Zero Woman doesn't seem very powerful or asskicking. I was expecting her to kick ass but then again with this plot if she did it would be over in 10 minutes. But she's just too weak.And Miki Sugimoto isn't even that attractive. Reiko Ike has that sexiness Meiko Kaji has the coolness but Miki Sugimoto has a fairly average body and a face that is barely good enough for a supporting role. Sorry Miki fans.This film had the potential and it actually had a really good opening scene. But after that the film went downhill all the way.Watch this if you are a Miki fan or a Pinky Violence completist. If you are looking for a entertaining film or at least one that isn't painful to watch then stay clear of this. However if you have already watched this and actually enjoyed it then do check out all the other pinky violence films that are available as they are all many times better than this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "While not perfectly accurate in every respect it is as near to accurate in all of the important respects the incredible risks personal and national and courage of the Czechs the importance of Heydrich and his cold brutal and efficient nature the ending for all involved in which no punches are pulled betrayals and loyalty how in military operations always expect the unexpected. Good understated acting appropriate to the real people. Portrayal of Heydrich equally understated and disturbingly normal. Great music. Haunting gutwrenching ending. Slow buildup to climax finely done. I saw the original in the 1970s video purchased a few years ago is fine except the subtitles are missing for the short Germanspeaking parts which I remember in any case. Key event of WWII if anyone merited assassination Heydrich did. Quite apart from his activities in Bohemia and Moravia where he was known as the Butcher of Prague his top position in the SS and police apparatus second only to Himmler and his key role in planning and executing the Holocaust left him with the blood of millions on his hands. Of interest if you watch Wannseekonferenz 1984 German with English subtitles and Operation Daybreak backtoback you have a continuous and accurate portrayal of Heydrich's last months. The former covers the 90 minutes of the Wannsee meeting in January 1942 in Berlin in which Heydrich as second most important police official in the Reich coordinates the implementation and industrialization of the Final Solution the latter covers from January to June his death in which he has added to his CV by becoming the political administrator of Czechoslovakia also a likely clue to his future ambitions. The two films could not be more different one almost a stage play the other more suspenseaction but are unified by excellent portrayals of Heydrich. It also underlines that while the Czechs assassinated Heydrich for purely national reasons there was no lack of other justifications. If you cannot obtain Wannseekonferenz the more recent 2001 English remake Conspiracy with Kenneth Branagh will do. IMDb members rate the German version 8.0 slightly higher than Conspiracy 7.7 a judgement I agree with.".

Great music amazing story and competent acting Anton Diffring was brilliant and very very scary just as Heydrich was supposed to be. I had to find out more about the story and to my surprise found out that it is almost completely true  gun jamming Heydrich dying ten days later grassed up by one of their own killing dozens of germans in the church both committing suicide at the end etc etc. I noticed previous comments about this film have queried whether it was worth the sacrifice of thousands of innocent people to assassinate one man namely Heydrich. Well let me just fill you in on this monster  The butcher of Prague The Hangman . It was Heydrich that was mainly responsible for the 'Final Solution' and in all probability 11000000 Jews would have been murdered if he had lived. Also he alone would have been responsible for the 'General Ost Plan' Hitlers determination to exterminate 30000000  yes 30000000  Slavs in Russia  Eastern Europe. One last point  Leningrad  Stalingrad would certainly have been German victories if Heydrich had lived. 40 of the wehrmacht tanks and artillery were produced in Czech protectorate factories. This production fell by 70 after Heydrich's death and not surprisingly lead to the collapse of the Russian divisions who relied mostly on the weaponry produced in Czechoslovakia. He was also in charge of the SD spying network which was incredibly successful.Make up your own mind  great film though.".

The motivation of the resistance was unquestionably heroic at this part of the episode.This is so much more than an action story. However the issues tend to be portrayed in a very polar black  white manner. Even Karel Chudra's motivation is shown in very clear terms he is treated far less sympathetically in Czech history. It is unfortunate that the film did not have time to develop the political tension between London and the local resistance. How aware was London of the probability of reprisals following the assassination? Was it their intention that reprisals would do more to stir local opposition to the occupation than the assassination itself? Why did Karel Moravec later take his own life?Overall however this is a film to see and for the most part it is very realistic. Visit Prague and leave the tourist traps to see St Cyril's  it looks just like the movie and is almost guaranteed to make you cry for all the victims of the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia.".

Next I ordered the VHS tape which arrived today and it is excellent including quite a few scenes that the network version omits. The only problem is as one viewer points out is that in this version there is no subtitles so you miss some of the dialog in the parts that are spoken in German. The network version includes the subtitles but is missing some scenes. The sound quality on the prerecorded VHS version is quite good if played back on a VHS hifi deck with a good sound system. I wish this movie were available on DVD! If anyone hears of it becoming available on DVD please let me know! Hopefully a future DVD release will address the subtitle problem. It is indeed surprising how little attention this movie got. I even ordered a couple of books on Heydrich from Amazon as well as the novel Seven men at Daybreak on which the movie is based. I find that the movie is nearly completely accurate. An excellent movie that anyone interested in history should see at least once.".

Knowing the film is based on true events makes it all the more poignant. The pace of the movie and almost gentle unfolding of events gives the viewer time to think. It's not the high speed violence we have become used to in recent years. A film of love and hate and the darkest days of the second world war.

I remember Anthony Andrews saying years later on The Michael Parkinson Show that it was a film he was particularly proud to have been a part of. Too right!

	schema:reviewBody "Film based on the true story of the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich in Prague and was adapted from the book Seven Men at Daybreak by Alan Burgess . During World War 2  in 1942 Czechoslovakia SSGeneral Reinhard Heydrich he was 38 when he was shot but Anton Diffring who was in his late fifties is appointed by Hitler George Sewell plays two parts in this movie he is a German officer seen at the film's climax and also briefly he plays Hitler to become the Reich Protector of Bohemia and Moravia  he is known as The Butcher of Prague. As a squad of Czech expatriates formed by three soldiers  Jan Kubis Timothy Bottoms  Karel Curda  Martin Shaw and Jozef Gabck Anthony Andrews are parachuted into Czechoslovakia in order to assassinate the German governor Reinhard Heydrich . The group is assigned a dangerous mission called Operation Daybreak  it was designed by the Allies to eliminate a highranking Nazi it is believed that Admiral Canaris passed crucial information to Allies for organizing the attack . They are helped by partisans as Jank Joss Ackland  Anna Nicola Pagett and Pyotr Vernon Dobtcheff .On 27 May 1942 Heydrich proceeded on his daily commute from his home to Prague Castle. Gabk and Kubi waited at the tram stop at a tight curve . The spot was chosen because the curve would force the car to slow down . As Heydrich's opentopped MercedesBenz reached the curve Gabk stepped in front of the vehicle trying to open fire but his Sten gun jammed. Heydrich ordered his driver SSOberscharfhrer Klein to stop the car. When Heydrich stood up to try to shoot Gabk Kubi threw a modified antitank grenade at the vehicle and its fragments ripped through the car's rightrear fender embedding shrapnel and fibres from the upholstery into Heydrich's body even though the grenade failed to enter the car . The assailants initially hid with two Prague families and later took refuge in an Orthodox church dedicated to Saints Cyril and Methodius in Prague. The Germans were unable to locate the attackers until Karel urda of the Out Distance sabotage group was arrested by the Gestapo and gave the names of the team's local contacts for a bounty .The assassination of Heydrich was one of the most significant moments in the history of the resistance in Czechoslovakia and is considered to be the strongest act of defiance throughout occupied Europe. The act had such an impact that it led to the immediate dissolution of the Munich Agreement as signed by Great Britain and France as well as Germany's ally Italy. Britain and France agreed that after the Nazis were defeated the annexed territory Sudetenland would be restored to Czechoslovakia. As Heydrich was one of the most important Nazi leaders two large funeral ceremonies were conducted. The first one was in Prague where the way to Prague Castle was lined by thousands of SS men with torches. The second was in Berlin attended by all leading Nazi figures including Hitler who placed the German Order and Blood Order medals on the funeral pillow. The betrayer Karel urda after attempting suicide was hanged in 1947 for high treason .It is based on the novel by Alan Burgess and on a true story that also was adapted by Fritz Lang in 1943 'Hangmen Also Die'  Hitler's Madman 1943 and Atentat 1964. It explores the preparations execution and aftermath of this operation and the bloody revenge on the Lidice village . Operation Daybreak shows the operation leading up to Heydrich's death as well as the massive German reprisals that followed it . This movie was one of the few productions who took the time and the effort of duplicating WW2 German Tiger tanks and since the film was set in the Czech republic the filmmakers made use of Czech army equipment .One of the best things about this interesting film results to be its excellent recreation  shot in Prague and authentic scenarios we have the full details of the events the arrival of the command the plan of attack the realization of it the Nazis retaliated with physical elimination of Lidice and as they surrounded the Church of St. Cyril by the treachery of one of the components of the command .

	schema:reviewBody "This detailed account of the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich in 1942 and the tragic aftermath is likely about as accurate as any dramatic film is likely to be on the subject. The Nazis took an appallingly vicious revenge and this film is a compelling somewhat flawed saga of the great tragedy that is war and conquest. Was the killing of Heydrich the Hangman to the Czechs really necessary considering the consequences? It must have seemed so to the British brass and the willing Czech volunteers but one wonders what the completely uninvolved victims in Lidice may have thought. Viewed as part of the overall slaughter of millions in the course of WW2 these were small numbers of victims but is even one death negligible? Did Heydrich's removal shorten the war at all? You will have to find your own answers.As a cinematic action film this is not an especially inspired production. The story of the parachuting in from British RAF planes of an assassination team proceeds rather slowly until the final battle at the church where the seven partisans were hiding. The German efforts to dislodge them are shown in a detail that may owe something to extrapolation from the facts. Who knows? In any case this is the exciting part of the film. As shown the seven wiped out simply hordes of attacking Germans before the last two took their own lives. There is no question but that in reality the partisans put up quite a fight. They would have had no incentive to surrender meekly to Nazi mercy.Acting except for the very convincing portrayal of Heydrich by Anton Diffring is generally lackluster with a few exceptions and the editing can only be described as choppy. The language convention may seem a tad strange. Conversations that would obviously have been in Czech are given in English. Conversations in German occur in German without subtitles. If you aren't fluent in German you may miss some nuances. Since few of the cast are Czechs there is not much slavic flavor evident. Who knows this may enhance the more universal message that war is hell. Oh and did Gabcik and Kubis really take their own lives at the end?".

If anyone reading this knows this film is doing the rounds on SKY or Turner Classic Movies please email me.I also liked the music and wondered if it was ever commercially available on a CD?";

Though the romance between Kubis and Anna is highly suspect  and a bit of a drag  the rest of the movie is taut and tense. This is one of the few films that brings out the fact that in war there are no heroes no villains  only victims. Though the Czech Resistance 'scored a hit  the German reprisals were so devastating that the Czech Resistance almost ceased to exist for the next three years.I call this as a 'small film because none of the cast are well known  except for a very young Joss Ackland . Anton Difring had been playing Nazis for years together but his resemblance to Reinhard Heydrich is startling  right down to the broad forehead aquiline nose.And he is chilling as Heydrich. Overall the thematic content visuals performances story telling  I would go far to say that this film is far superior to most other grand war films.

Would the allies drop agents into occupied Europe in daylight? Would the holed up assassins waste their ammunition so liberally. And would the Nazis send so many soldiers into the church basement with so many casualties when there would have been quicker and more effecient tactics.

	schema:headline " A superior war film based on a true event";
	schema:reviewBody "I haven't seen Operation Daybreak for many years and saw a recording last night as there was a blizzard outside and the television had gone off. Firstly as this is based on a true story and doesn't deviate much from what really happened in Prague in 1942 Operation Daybreak is one of the best war films of all time even if it has fallen off the radar since the seventies.Basically the plot is about a group of Czech resistance fightersa very young Martin Shaw and Anthony Andrews play their roles excellently who are parachuted into Czechoslovakia to assassinate the infamous Reinhard Heydrich second in command to Heinrich Himmler the creator of the Holocaust and brutal governor of the country. As ever Anton Diffring is on top form doing what he does best playing cold eyed Nazis ironically in real life Diffring hated the Nazis and fled the country in 1939 as he was both gay and anti Nazi something the real life Heydrich would have hated. Also Heydrich is portrayed as both a cold hearted killer and a devoted family man again quite true to life.Yet apart from a top notch performance from Diffring Martin Shaw and Anthony Andrews take excellent roles as the assassins an original plan to open fire on Heydrich's special train goes wrong when another train passes so they decide to gun him down in his open top Mercedes in Prague. True to real life events Shaw's machine gun sticks and Heydrich is felled by a grenade thrown into the car which leads to the evil Obergruppenfueher having to endure a slow agonising death in hospital from internal injuries. However in a twist to the story with the Nazis carrying out massive reprisals for the death of Heydrich Shaw decides to go to the Nazis and confess all helped along by some torture if the Gestapo leave his family alone. In a cruel twist the Nazis torture and kill his entire family which proves this was worthless but Shaw continues his treachery by revealing where the resistance fighters are hiding.This is where Operation Daybreak turns into a battle worthy of better known epics where the resistance fighters are hidden in the crypt of a church run by a sympathetic priest played most ably by Cyril Shaps. Again largely true to events the six resistance fighters manage to take out a large number of SS men before the Nazis decide to flood the crypt and faced with either death by drowning or terrible punishment by the Nazis take their own lives.I would recommend Operation Daybreak to anyone who wants to watch a war film based on true events the death of Heydrich has been covered before in Hangmen Also Die but this has dated badly and was made on hearsay during the war and also because the cast which also includes Timothy Bottoms Joss Ackland and Nicola Pagett play such convincing and sympathetic roles. It's interesting as a sidenote that the scenes in Prague were actually filmed there rather than a mock up which is interesting as this was the height of the Cold War.".

	schema:reviewBody "For admirers of quality movies one of the greatest sources of frustration has always been the inverse ration that exists between movies that are good and movies that make money.  The essential rule of thumb is that with few exceptions the larger a film's budget happens to be the less likely that that film will have anything new or original to say.  The corollary principle is that given the choice between patronizing a film that is original complex and meaningful and one that is derivative simpleminded and thematically empty the mass audience will go with the latter type every time.  Driven by the need for profits large studios are then forced to cater to this lowest common denominator' mentality.  The result is that wonderful little films are almost invariably squeezed out of the marketplace left to languish in obscure art houses scattered in a few major cities while bloated mindless multimillion dollar monstrosities fill sprawling megaplexes found in cities suburbs and rural areas stretching literally from coast to coast.How many people for instance have even heard of let alone seen Where the Money Is'?  Yet here is a film dedicated to the spirit of pure fun a lighthearted black comedy that is blessedly free of the hardboiled cynicism and explicit violence that plague so many such films.  The film hooks the audience from the very start with the originality of its plot and setting. Set in a small Oregon town though the film was rather inexplicably filmed in the environs of Montreal the movie stars the superb Linda Fiorentino and Dermot Mulroney as long time high school sweethearts who have married right after graduation found their comfortable little niche in the small world they inhabit and now begun to take each other for granted.  The opening scene introduces us to them as they are roadhousing around on prom night in his prize Mustang the one symbol of a rebellious youth that he still clings to all these years later.  It is at her job  as a nurse at a local convalescent hospital  that a measure of excitement reenters their humdrum lives and relights the long dormant spark of adventure that she in particular has been missing.   This novelty comes in the form of an aging bank robber Paul Newman who has apparently suffered a stroke and is sent to the rest home due to overcrowding at the prison hospital.The early scenes of the film are wickedly funny as Fiorentino suspicious that her new patient may just be faking it plays a clever little game of catandmouse to try to catch him in his impressive charade.  Suddenly having achieved her goal she is not quite so sure who is really the cat and who the mouse.  To say more about the plot would really do a disservice to this film which manages to keep us intrigued by the unpredictability of its most unusual setup.  Fiorentino and Mulroney are thoroughly believable as a couple of onceedgy youngsters grown into responsible comfortable but slightly restless adults.  She in particular finds herself stifled by the humdrum quality of both their life and their marriage together.  Mulroney on the other hand seems to have pretty much lost that desire for living on the edge yet for her sake and perhaps for the sake of that tiny spark for adventure that still lives unquenched somewhere deep inside him he is willing to meet her halfway  even if a bit reluctantly  on the field of lawlessness.  Newman as the expert bank robber who stumbles unexpectedly into their lives provides the perfect catalyst for renewed adventure.The amazing thing about Where the Money Is' is that thanks to its writers Max Frye Topper Lilien and Carroll Cartwright and the director Marek Kanievska the film never ends up taking itself too seriously.  It always knows that its prime purpose is to give the audience a fun time.  This it does with the help of its three dazzling stars who seem to be having the time of their professional lives Fiorentino is especially wonderful.  It sure must be infectious because we in the audience have a pretty damn good time watching them.".

	onyx:emotionText "For admirers of quality movies one of the greatest sources of frustration has always been the inverse ration that exists between movies that are good and movies that make money.  The essential rule of thumb is that with few exceptions the larger a film's budget happens to be the less likely that that film will have anything new or original to say.  The corollary principle is that given the choice between patronizing a film that is original complex and meaningful and one that is derivative simpleminded and thematically empty the mass audience will go with the latter type every time.  Driven by the need for profits large studios are then forced to cater to this lowest common denominator' mentality.  The result is that wonderful little films are almost invariably squeezed out of the marketplace left to languish in obscure art houses scattered in a few major cities while bloated mindless multimillion dollar monstrosities fill sprawling megaplexes found in cities suburbs and rural areas stretching literally from coast to coast.How many people for instance have even heard of let alone seen Where the Money Is'?

	schema:reviewBody "Paul Newman shines in this implausible but highly watchable caper flick about three unlikely armored car robbers.  It is hard to believe that Newman is 75.  He is fitter and more energetic than most men who are fifteen years his junior.  He singlehandedly elevates this film from mediocrity.The story is nothing unique.  Henry Newman is a bank robber who is delivered to a nursing home after a debilitating stroke.  His nurse Linda Fiorentino suspects he is not the vegetable he appears to be.  After she gets him to admit his ruse she exhorts him to knock off an armored truck with her.Director Marek Kanievska and writer Max Frye leave numerous gaps in the story.  We never discover what tips off Carol that Henry is faking.  They didn't do enough character development of Carol and Wayne Dermot Mulroney to make it believable that they would want to become criminals no less hatch the scheme.  The idea that Carol was pretending to be the dispatcher for the armored car company from a cell phone in the truck is a flimsy concoction.  Even with digital technology most cell phones in moving vehicles sound like cell phones and you can hear road noises and the engine running.Still despite a lackluster script the film is enjoyable because of Paul Newman.  Newman gives a fantastic rendition of a stroke victim and his hardened and cantankerous portrayal was marvelous.  Linda Fiorentino plays the scheming sexkitten nurse in one of her better performances.  The screen chemistry between Fiorentino and Newman is excellent with undercurrents of sexual desire constantly flaring up between them.  Dermot Mulroney is relegated to a role that was essentially a fifth wheel and is adequate as Carol's loser of a husband.I rated this film a 710.  It is good entertainment and an opportunity to see a master at work.  Newman hasn't lost a beat in a movie career that spans almost a half a century.  It is worth seeing for him alone.".

But as if to test his powers in the shagging and intriguing caper Where the money is Newman plays Henry a former famous bank robber and current guest of the prison system who actually is in a coma or at least a stroke like state of suspended animation. Slumped and glazed Henry sits for hours in his wheelchair at the nursing home to which he has been transferred tended to by Carol Linda Fiorentino a less than angelic nurse and onetime prom queen. Carol lives with her husband in the same drab town where she grew up. She's bored as a former prom queen always is. And she's convinced that Henry  who had led the only interesting life around  is faking his stupor. So she bamboozles him into dropping his act then promises to keep the secret if he'll include her on just one more Bonnie and Clyde size heist. British director Marek Kanievska counts on the audience knowing that Newman's fame is tied to playing heist pros and hustlers and that we're not just seeing some gravel voiced coot in a wheelchair  we're seeing what Butch Cassidy might have become had he not messed up in Bolivia. The minimalist acting the star has done in recent films like Message in a bottle and Nobody's fool serves him well because he's confident  rightfully so that the audience will fill in the blanks. Incorrigible Henry is fundamentally opaque but canny Newman lets his eyes do the talking. As for Fiorentino the star of The last seduction reprises her dangerous restless woman persona as if to remind us and casting agents that if she got every role currently going to Catherine Zeta Jones movies would be a lot more interesting. The payoff is the clash between a taciturn bandit faking feebleness and an angry Florence Nightingale faking compassion played by two actors who are the real thing.".

As you can guess it's a heist film with plenty of hilarity and real suspense.  Keep in mind it's a mild hilarity and suspense with subtle exchanges and real emotional investment.  The scenes play slowly and meticulously like a heist waiting for the exact moment to give us the payoff.  They hit the mark more often than not in both arenas of comedy and suspenseThe chemistry between the principles is strong especially with Fiorentino and Newman with intelligent dialogue that takes the plot through a natural progression that doesn't betray the two lead characters.Make no mistake Newman's presence elevates this film as he often does and he does it with such ease that it's a joy to watch. If you like Newman's recent work this film will not disappoint you.As I have indicated it's a slow film not too deep not overly witty but subtle.

In this film she plays Carol Ann McKay a bored nurse in a retirement or nursing home who meets Paul Newman's character who is a retired professional heister. With her husband played by Dermot Mulroney the three plan the ideal heist with an armored car. I read that Fiorentino and Newman got along very well on the film and both live in the same town in Connecticut. Fiorentino would have been willing to do a sex scene with him if she was given the opportunity. Anyway the three are a great team. The story is pretty good because Fiorentino Newman and Mulroney make the lines come alive. I wish Fiorentino and Newman were still working making movies. As you get older in this business particularly females you are over the hill over 40 years old. For men it's different but even Newman has given up the acting part of the business because it's so uninspiring. Films like this never do well at the box office. It could have done very well on television or cable. Fiorentino is stunning at the end of the film. It's not all about the money as it is about getting away with it and the thrills and adrenalin of being and feeling alive.".

	schema:reviewBody "Henry robs banks because that's 'where the money is'.  Unfortunately he has suffered a stroke and is confined to a wheelchair rendering his stealing days over.  Or does it?The film starts with a flashback to Carol and Wayne leaving the prom as newly crowned King and Queen driving recklessly and crashing.  Years later their relationship and life is stale and boring  but only Carol thinks so. It could be argued that the flashback is just an extraneous piece of action to keep the audience interested  which is true  but it also shows where Carol and Wayne are coming from and contrasts with the dull life they have now.The film asks you to root for criminals and isn't the first film to do that by any means but what I find interesting is what makes the normally moral cheer amorality.  Harry had to all intents and purposes retired from a life of crime but ironically he gets his stolen money stolen and can't go to the police  for obvious reasons.  Many in the audience would identify with Carol wanting to escape to something better.  The potential victims are all big businesses and one of the owners in particular is a snotty tosser.  And the plan is to rob without violence or the threat of violence.Where the Money Is never drags as it reaches its conclusion.  The dialogue is always excellent and there are at least a couple of classic lines in there.  Being very picky about plotting I couldn't fault the screenwriters' work.What struck me most about the film was the simplicity and economy of the writing.  It's a crime that the film didn't make its money back domestically in theatres.  It's meant to be Paul Newman's last ever film and it's good that it's something so artistically successful if not commercially so.".

Sure it doesn't have explicit sex gratuitous violence or four letter words. What it does have is Paul Newman. The eternally youthful Newman returns to the role that he does best...the con artist. In Where the Money Is Newman plays an imprisoned bank robber who cons prison officials into believing that he has suffered a stroke. Because of overcrowding in the prison hospital he is temporarily transferred to an outside facility. There he comes under the care of nurse Linda Fiorentino and her husband Dermot Mulroney. Fiorentino suspects that Newman is faking it and sets out to find out what he is up to. What follows is a delightful caper reminiscent of some of Newman's earlier films. Newman in his best part in years really makes you believe that he has suffered a stroke and even in his mid70s proves that he can still charm the ladies. Fiorentino is sexy and ambitious and you wind up rooting for her and Newman to pull their caper off. Mulroney is also good as Fiorentino's sceptical husband. I don't think that today's younger movie goers really appreciate the talent of Paul Newman and I can only suggest that they go back and watch some of his earlier work to gain a better appreciation. Where the Money Is is a thoroughly enjoyable movie and is a must for all Paul Newman fans.".

The problem I had wasn't him it was the two younger actors Linda Fiorentino and Dermot Mulroney. Have you noticed how many lowlife people Fiorentino plays in films? Check out The Last Seduction Jade etc. This woman is not appealing to me. Mulroney is another actor who plays a lot of punks including the guy in here Wayne MacKay. Both of those people ruined this film for me although all three leads are not good people. That was a main problem for a number of viewers no good guys meaning nobody to root for. The story starts out promising but sinks fast and never recovers. It's tough to like a story when you don't care about any of the characters and it's a weak script to begin with. Still....one wonders why Newman went into this project.".

I have to give credit to Fiorentino and Mulroney because they play off Newman very well.Where The Money Is is captivating as it is funny.

It moves at a very quick pace with a lot of twists and excitement.  Newman gives another good performance especially when he stays comatose during a lap dance by Fiorentino. However the direction is a little too compact.  You almost wish it would slow up a bit and add a little more flavor or atmosphere. The idea of a nice law abiding couple suddenly doing a major crime seems a bit hard to believe. Also the color schemes within the hospital are downright ugly!

The triangular chemistry repartee and interactions between the three stars was marvelous.  Newman was brilliant as the zenlike bank robber.

In this fishoutofwater caper comedy he is at a full tilt sublimity altogether.Newman is career criminal Henry Manning who's latest longgoing con is assuming the identity of a stroke victim to get him moved out of the cooler into a nursing home but finds his cunningly sly faade picked apart from by shrewd and sexy Carol the alluringly appealing Fiorentino a nurse looking for a quick way out of her humdrum posthigh school senior prom queen decline.  Her suspicions lead to a comic melange of experimental stunts to break the seemingly comatose geezer out of his haze and finally succeeds when she enlists her spouse Wayne Mulroney for an outing to a near by river where she proceeds to run Manning's wheelchair off the pier and relieved when he emerges from the drink scowling at his masquerade.Manning explains how he came to adopt his charade to the couple he read a lot on yoga tantric hypnoticism and a lot of New Age philosophy enabling him to remain statuelike who enlist him on his next crime.  Deciding on an armed money truck heist the trio hatch the plan with nimble and clever strokes ultimately leading to the notsoperfect crime.The film's structure resembles a watered down Elmore Leonard the story is by E.

But by the time the act takes place the film betrays itself in the unspooling of its aftermath and the choice of the usually leaden Mulroney deflates its breezy execution.But Newman shines once again in a memorable turn oddly enough resembling the Burt Reynolds crime comedy Breaking In' where he played an aging safecracker giving pointers to his protg in training.  His glistening glacier eyes sparkle even when masked in his fauxfrozen grimmace in the earlier half of the film waiting to spring to life again almost relievedly when Fiorentino finally breaks his spell.  He's always exhibited a carefree tohellwithauthority repose that echoes some of his classic characters including Cool Hand Luke and Fast Eddie Felson.

Cinematography by Dudely is breezy and spirited thanks to brilliantly shot action sequences.Who cares even if it is larger than life! Screenplay by Yunus Sajawal is zippy. If these aspects would not have been better than movie would have been high on style and low on content which I am glad is not the case with Singham.Bunch of Marathi Actors and Kajal Aggarwal are takeaways too.

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Singham";
	schema:reviewBody "It's no secret I enjoy the slew of Hindi films out in the last year or so that feature tough no nonsense cops as their lead protagonist from Salman Khan's Chulbul Pandey in Dabangg that started the ball rolling then Abhishek Bachchan as ACP Vishnu Kamath in Dumb Maaro Dumb and now Ajay Devgn too getting into the act as the titular Bajirao Singham. Devgn's star has been shining quite brightly of late with Raajneeti Aakrosh and Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai from last year that allowed him to flex his acting muscles and here he goes completely brawny as the cop symbolizing the themes from the lion motif of courage and raw power  even the opening song and dance credits are designed around the lion's roar and paw.Director Rohit Shetty teams with his preferred leading man Devgn to bring this remake of the Tamil film Singam which had starred Suriya though in this version it's less of a mano a mano with the main villain Jaikant Shikre where actor Prakash Raj reprised his villainous role as the chief gangster operating in Goa whose links with politicians and the upper ranks of the police make him untouchable so much so that he's responsible for the suicide of an honest officer whom he framed as he was getting too close for comfort in arresting him.It's interesting to look at the narrative as how a lion got taken out of its den and put into unfamiliar surroundings forcing it at times into a corner. But like all wild animals this may result in the animal biting back with increased ferocity. Similar to Chulbul Pandey Bajirao Singham is a small village cop who represents the law in his hometown through a combination of strength wisdom and plenty of slowmotion swagger preferring community policing and solving the community's problems without smacking down the penal code on offenders. This of course elevates his standing in the village which comes in useful when he has to summon the big time gangster Jaikant to the station for a conditional bail release.In what he thought was a promotion for a job well done Singham gets transferred to the city of Goa before Jaikant lets loose that it's engineered through the greasing of palms and now with Singham in Jaikant's town and reach life becomes a living hell naturally. This toss up between hero and villain forms the bulk of the second half of the film in what would be a simple straightforward story made a lot enjoyable through its sheer entertainment value with really deliberate over the top action sequences that you'd chuckle at  you know how one slap can leave a man flying through the air or how there are many physicsdefying moves that would make all wouldbe villains give up their life of crime when this long arm of the law reaches them. One of the more audacious stunts involves a car flipping through the air while our hero reaches in through the car window and yanking the driver out with one hand before the car smashes through the ground. Take that Hollywood!But all work and no play makes Singham a dull boy as well. In a typical Masala offering Singham has its fair share of moments away from the pursuit of hoodlums or goons as the subtitles would have it for precious romance with Kavya Bhosle Kajal Aggarwal and family time both his and hers and romantic song and dance interludes that are inevitable. Check out the title tune though which is quite reminiscent of Dabangg's exalting song of fearlessness.It's not all plain action oriented as I would think some may find it controversial in Singham's unorthodox methods of fighting fire with fire when he discovers the rot in society is something quite beyond one man's ability to combat. I suppose tough cop stories will not go out of fashion from the Indian film industry anytime soon for its tales of fighting against corruption in all strata and levels of society serving as an outlet in fantasy that can be eradicated completely with the enlistment of help from those who choose to stand up and be counted upon to do the right thing. This becomes that overarching reminder in the film despite Singham having to involve questionable methods which can be easily classified as police brutality in certain countries as well with the number of beltwhipping scenes though in all earnestness politicians such as the ones featured do deserve nothing more than a good smack on the buttocks.Still his is a film after all which allows for our fantasies at having those evil at heart receive their just desserts swiftly and painfully without too much fuss in going through a system corrupted by the rich and powerful. Singham firmly sets itself as one of my favourites of the year and it's wishful thinking on my part if Ajay Devgn and Salman Khan can share the screen together once again after London Dreams to feature two tough police characters in one crossover film. Now that would be a double dose of hard hitting action and no nonsense police action adventure and villains everywhere better beware! Highly recommended!".

	schema:headline " Though not great but still has some timely roars of a LION and a likable climax.";
	schema:reviewBody "With SINGHAM sons of two famous action masters of Bollywood return to their original genre in style. Veeru Devgun Ajay's father and Shetty Rohit's father were known for their own class in the Industry few decades before and now their proud sons return to the same genre with which they had started. But sadly the attempt remains a visibly polished product only having few weak associations in the narrative which don't really give you a DABANGIAN kind of entertainment on the whole. Still it cannot be called a bad film for sure because it does have some great moments to offer and a winner climax which scores a clear six at the end acting as its big savior. It's an Official remake of Tamil Hit Movie SINGAM and is all about an honest cop fighting against a mafia don and his empire based on strong political connections. Being a remake it has got all the ingredients of a typical south masala film which are just there to add some extra flavors into the film and nothing else. For instance there is a love affair track going along with the Cop's fight which has no value of its own in the script as usual there is a deliberately created comedy track around the pet name of a character which successfully generates some laughs in the start but later on becomes annoying. And as seen before there exists the same eccentric kind of villain working against the Cop whose dialogues become comical towards the end played once again by the one  only Prakash Raj. The film starts off well with an impressive sequence revolving around the expressive eyes of a small child. But post that for about 1 long hour it offers nothing as per the expectations raised until the scene where Ajay and Prakash meet for the first time. The LION actually starts roaring at this very moment and then keeps roaring post interval till the climax in gaps. Hence the first half is not that effective as compared to the second one since it keeps focusing on various other subplots in the script which do not register at all. The romance track falls flat and so does the family comedy angle forced into the proceedings to provide some relief moments. Though SINGHAM scores high in its technical department such as Cinematography and Action but it fails completely in its soundtrack. AjayAtul's music works just as a filler with nothing worth listening. And its really annoying to hear another title song inspired from the cult Vishal Bhardwaj's track Omkara sung by Sukhwinder. Moreover the Background Score is both effective as well as noisy at times with excess of loud arrangements in all those slow motion sequences. Apart from Ajay Devgan and Prakash Raj only Sudhanshu Pandey and Sonali Kulkarni are able to make an impact on the viewer and rest all work under the shadow of its two main giants. The debutant Kaajal looks fresh and bubbly but in absence of anything special written for her she is not able to prove her talent in any of her scenes. Ajay Devgan once again proves his versatility returning to the action genre after a string of comical hits. His body language specifically his eyes seem to be just perfect for such roles and he comes up like a winner all through the film. Prakash Raj though is splendid in his typical negative role but this time it looked like repetitive to me towards the climax. Yet he is immensely watchable with Ajay on the screen. In short the film completely belongs to Ajay and Prakash Raj who generate such kind of mighty impact in their scenes together that the single screen theaters are bound to go full of whistles claps and thundering applause.In fact the main reason behind the probable success of this film has to be these particular scenes including the one with the Neta Ji where Ajay answers his powerful enemies with fiery dialogues and strong punches along with its worth watching action sequences which have been shot with lan. However at times the action also seems to be too unbelievable with some impossible kind of stunts. In the writing department I particularly liked the thought of the National Emblem being given to the cops to wear it in their caps but not to the Country's top political leaders to use it in their dresses. Plus the icing on the cake for all the viewers loving such kind of over the top masala cinema should be its well written climax which really needs to be applauded for its thoughtful idea and brilliant execution. So overall SINGHAM does have its merits in the form of some worth watching confrontation sequences and superb action. But if you are looking for something fresh or novel then you are sure going to be disappointed with its routine kind of content. The film is not consistent enough in its narration as the real action starts after almost 45 minutes into the movie and it also becomes a bit repetitive towards the end. Yet for all Ajay Devgan's fans its festival time in the theaters. However the last half an hour of the film forced me to think about its original makers of the South.To be specific it struck me that if South Films are able to think of such great climax and other similar interesting plots in their own movies which in turn inspire Bollywood to make their remakes then certainly the SOUTH CINEMA is miles ahead of Hindi CINEMA in filmmaking. May be the Hindi Film Industry is enjoying more success due to their overpopular stars and glamour but if studied in real sense then South Cinema is undoubtedly more important experimental and bold which needs to be recognized at the earliest as an essential part of Indian CINEMA.".

	onyx:emotionText "With SINGHAM sons of two famous action masters of Bollywood return to their original genre in style. Veeru Devgun Ajay's father and Shetty Rohit's father were known for their own class in the Industry few decades before and now their proud sons return to the same genre with which they had started. But sadly the attempt remains a visibly polished product only having few weak associations in the narrative which don't really give you a DABANGIAN kind of entertainment on the whole. Still it cannot be called a bad film for sure because it does have some great moments to offer and a winner climax which scores a clear six at the end acting as its big savior. It's an Official remake of Tamil Hit Movie SINGAM and is all about an honest cop fighting against a mafia don and his empire based on strong political connections. Being a remake it has got all the ingredients of a typical south masala film which are just there to add some extra flavors into the film and nothing else. For instance there is a love affair track going along with the Cop's fight which has no value of its own in the script as usual there is a deliberately created comedy track around the pet name of a character which successfully generates some laughs in the start but later on becomes annoying. And as seen before there exists the same eccentric kind of villain working against the Cop whose dialogues become comical towards the end played once again by the one  only Prakash Raj. The film starts off well with an impressive sequence revolving around the expressive eyes of a small child. But post that for about 1 long hour it offers nothing as per the expectations raised until the scene where Ajay and Prakash meet for the first time. The LION actually starts roaring at this very moment and then keeps roaring post interval till the climax in gaps. Hence the first half is not that effective as compared to the second one since it keeps focusing on various other subplots in the script which do not register at all. The romance track falls flat and so does the family comedy angle forced into the proceedings to provide some relief moments. Though SINGHAM scores high in its technical department such as Cinematography and Action but it fails completely in its soundtrack. AjayAtul's music works just as a filler with nothing worth listening. And its really annoying to hear another title song inspired from the cult Vishal Bhardwaj's track Omkara sung by Sukhwinder. Moreover the Background Score is both effective as well as noisy at times with excess of loud arrangements in all those slow motion sequences. Apart from Ajay Devgan and Prakash Raj only Sudhanshu Pandey and Sonali Kulkarni are able to make an impact on the viewer and rest all work under the shadow of its two main giants. The debutant Kaajal looks fresh and bubbly but in absence of anything special written for her she is not able to prove her talent in any of her scenes. Ajay Devgan once again proves his versatility returning to the action genre after a string of comical hits. His body language specifically his eyes seem to be just perfect for such roles and he comes up like a winner all through the film. Prakash Raj though is splendid in his typical negative role but this time it looked like repetitive to me towards the climax. Yet he is immensely watchable with Ajay on the screen. In short the film completely belongs to Ajay and Prakash Raj who generate such kind of mighty impact in their scenes together that the single screen theaters are bound to go full of whistles claps and thundering applause.In fact the main reason behind the probable success of this film has to be these particular scenes including the one with the Neta Ji where Ajay answers his powerful enemies with fiery dialogues and strong punches along with its worth watching action sequences which have been shot with lan. However at times the action also seems to be too unbelievable with some impossible kind of stunts. In the writing department I particularly liked the thought of the National Emblem being given to the cops to wear it in their caps but not to the Country's top political leaders to use it in their dresses. Plus the icing on the cake for all the viewers loving such kind of over the top masala cinema should be its well written climax which really needs to be applauded for its thoughtful idea and brilliant execution. So overall SINGHAM does have its merits in the form of some worth watching confrontation sequences and superb action. But if you are looking for something fresh or novel then you are sure going to be disappointed with its routine kind of content.

Indian residents are complete idiots for liking Chulbul Pandey so much Salman's acting was not even close to Ajay's role in this movie.Action was great casting was great. Prakash Raj has now become my favorite villain of all time. He was damn good in Wanted and I had hoped to see him again and thankfully he was in Bbuddah Hoga Terra Baap. But I had no idea I will see him again in this movie I absolutely loved his acting. So far my favorite villains has been Amrish Puri Ashutosh Rana Rahul Dev and now it's Prakash Raj. I really hope to see him more and more.I really hoped Rohit Shetty would've given this movie a different title to attract more audiences because this movie was 10x better than Wanted and 20x better than Dabaang.Well Done Rohit Shetty and Team!!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "The acute problem of limited powers with law and order enforcers has been exposed several times in our films but seldom has it been really effective. Amitabh Bachchan's sincerity in 'Khakee' Sanjay Dutt's battle in 'Kurukshetra' Salman's 'Dabangg' and Abhishek's 'Dumb Maaro Dumb' are among those who defied norms and confronted all adversaries by themselves. Drawing inspiration from 2010's superhit Tamil film starring Surya 'Golmaal' series director Rohit Shetty embraces the highflying ridiculous action that defines his absurdity but renders a thrilling gripping tale of injustice and abuse of power that ensues in the Goan town. One determined Police Officer reminiscent of the angry young man of the 70's will turn the tables of power around while being righteous and astute. Bajirao Singham is Ajay Devgan's most powerful character yet and this lion hearted Officer's battle is among the most thrilling action films in recent times. Incredulous as it may seem the credit goes to Rohit Shetty.A sincere Police Officer who was wrongly framed in corruption charges relinquishes his career family and life in frustration that is caused by the system's infallible ability to bend to power. The widow seeks justice in the midst of greed power and indifference until a new Inspector arrives in town..... Heralding from a quaint Maratha village the local hero enforces law and order through his unique leadership that involves participation. To his roar the entire village will rise in uproar leaving the Goan goon Jaykant Shikre Prakash Raj humiliated when he tries to threaten Singham in his own backyard. As power unmasks its nefarious side Singham gets transferred to Goa and from here on the lion walks into the hunting grounds.....Singham's fastpaced narrative essentially grips you throughout engaging you into the battle against the malicious gangster while some occasional relief though in form of a mere distraction is posed by Kaavya Kaajal Agarwal  Telugu super duper star. Among the supporting cast the talented veteran actor Ashok Saraf leaves a heart warming impression as the retiring constable whose belief in the system is only rekindled with the advent of Singham. Sonali Kulkarni lends some seriousness to her tragedy that goes beyond just tears while Sachin Khedekar provides the comic relief that's quite unexpected from him.Prakash Raj gets to revisit the character he played just last year but his dialogue delivery is flawless and so is his zeal for acting that comes naturally as though he is Jaykant Shikre.... If there was any actor today who could play an angry young man and with his tone countenance and threatening presence make the boxoffice catch fire it would be Ajay Devgan. In his portrayal as Bajirao Singham he literally brings his strengths to the table while leaving out his weakness that is comedy. As he adorns a tight fitting uniform that serves as his superhero costume he gains the ability to send cars and people flying through the air in so incredulous a manner that is now a trademark of Rohit Shetty's films. But apart from the ridiculous action sequences Singham's roar is a powerful one. The plot is yet another good cop vs corrupt system battle but Singham's approach his solutions to harassment his determined stance on principles and his composed rage are the elements that make this film a laudable entertainer. Also when compared with Shetty's prior ventures this isn't such a mindless film. The banality of the plot is overcome by a screenplay that grips the viewer as it races through Singham's transfer from village to city. What is even more fun to watch is how against all adversity Singham's determination roars on screen and outwits outpunches and outdoes Shikre's each move. Marathi artists AjayAtul have one outstanding track in a mediocre album. The title song with Sukhwinder Singh's superb rendition and the Singham chant that evokes the intensity in the film's important scenes are worth the entire album itself. Perhaps it is Singham that will partially erase the memory of Rohit Shetty's deplorable works in the past. Apart from bits of 'Golmaal 3' he had nothing on his resume but now a blockbuster from Chennai has changed all that. Shetty is now the man behind Ajay Devgan's and 2011's biggest hit in the making. For an action film about an angry young Cop Singham scores with his roars....8.42 on a scale of 110.".

	schema:reviewBody "You're looking for entertainment right? Then seek no further than Singham the most ridiculous offthechain and gleefully insane action movie you'll ever see. Combining all manner of completely incompatible genres with preposterous action an inhumanly perfect hero and a kicking soundtrack the film sounds like the recipe for disaster but what it actually is is 2 and a half hours of pure fun.It's probably best to quickly explain just what this movie is first. Although I know very little of Bollywood what I've read is that Singham is a throwback to a classic genre of action movies from the 70s and 80s where reality was thrown out the window in favour of incredible theatrics and walltowall entertainment. As far as reviving that style goes I have to say that Singham is a stunning success.Whilst there's so much that you'll love about this film the one thing that's completely unforgettable is the action. Over the course of its very long runtime Singham effectively spaces out some brilliant action sequences that keep the pace moving extremely rapidly and continue to bring more fun to the viewers just when you think it's all getting a little repetitive.But the action sequences themselves are things of absolute beauty. Taking the heavily stylised nature of the 70s and 80s action movies to another level you won't believe how overthetop unrealistic and plain idiotic some of the fight sequences are. And yet it all fits in perfectly with the film's delightful and funloving atmosphere.Slapping a villain on the head doesn't send him flying 20 feet into the air in reality. Singham doesn't care. Violently whipping a bad guy until he cracks isn't what Hollywood heroes do. Singham doesn't care about that either. And stepping out of a powersliding car before firing a bullet at an oncoming enemy Jeep before that Jeep then flies miles into the air and then grabbing the villain out of its window before it hits the ground right behind you and then striking a pose while a lion roars isn't all too common. But you guessed it Singham doesn't care one bit.And that's where we get onto the film's other greatest point Singham himself. As far as action heroes go he's the complete package. He's got the charisma of James Bond the talents of Bruce Lee and the moral code of Captain America. And an epic moustache.So when it comes down to it what more do you need? Yes he may not have a particularly compelling backstory nor do any of his abilities have any bearing to the bounds of reality unless it's a supermoustache that he's wearing but as far as entertaining likable and effortlessly cool movie heroes go Singham has to be up there with the finest of all.As you can tell then the main thing that makes Singham such a good movie is that it's a hell of a lot of fun to watch. However its story isn't quite as impressive. Although doing a great job at bringing a compelling and threatening villain to face off against Singham and providing an exciting and interesting story I can't say that the screenplay here brings any real depth to any of the characters.Appearing like the sort of superheroes and villains you see in comic books there's not much here to engross you beyond the madly enjoyable action and over the course of a two and a half hour runtime that does occasionally lead to some less entertaining moments although that fortunately happens far less often than you'd expect.If there's any major issue that I have with this film it's the musical numbers. I said earlier that the film has a 'kicking soundtrack' and I stand by that but I'm effectively referring to one song the theme song which plays again and again every time Singham strikes a pose or brings down a bad guy. It's fantastically cool and adds massively to the film's funloving vibes.However there are also two fullon musical numbers here. Both of them love ballads and both of woefully misplaced in the middle of a wild action ride unfortunately throwing off the pace and atmosphere of the entire film dramatically for three or four minutes. There's only two of them throughout the whole thing but they do a lot of damage to the flow of such an entertaining movie when they crop up.So in the end is Singham the movie that critics and historians of the future will look back on and ponder? I like to think so. But for the time being it does exactly what it aims to do pretty much perfectly. It's not a sobadit'sgood movie rather a deliberate and loving throwback to a genre of yesteryear and with excellent directing and acting along with its perfectly manic atmosphere it makes for two and a half hours of incredible fun.".

The film stars Ajay Devgan as Singham the head of a local Police station whose character is like a cross between Judge Dredd and a Holy priest. So one minute he'll be pistol whipping a goondoh and the next minute he'll be serving up coffee to some lepers in Gujarat.The story portrays the bureaucracy inherent in the Police and also the Indian Government which allows corruption to exist and proliferate. Prakash Raj plays baddie Jaykant Shikre who wants to own the whole of India. He puts in a great performance equal and opposite to Devgan's Singham.Devgan as Singham looks like a well tanned but middle aged Mitchell Johnson. When Mitch is not sledging he's out with his honey Kajal Agarwal who looks like the typical girl next door for 14 year old boys. Therefore Devgan and Agarwal look curiously mismatched when together on screen. Agarwal's performance was good considering her part was like a little snack compared to the feast devoured by the other two and also that she had to pretend to love her Kaka Gee. Maybe the reason for the Johnson style tache is to hide Singham's false teeth?I'm sure most people can identify with the scenarios in the film particularly when dealing with the outlaws that surface in everyday life. The premise of the story is excellent but it is inevitably compromised in places to provide the film's obligatory happy ending. Nevertheless it's a light and enjoyable ride!Pros  Great action story lead and support rolesCons  Take it or leave it fighting and dancing scenesOverall  The ancient long forgotten and mysterious Police Academy training bible".

	schema:reviewBody "The only reason for the 2 rating as opposed to a 1 is because of the money shot  the devgan eightpack rising from the water in majestic slowmo. Which actually gave rise to a question that would vex me over the next 2.5 hours viz. how is that lungi remaining draped around the devgan pelvic girdle? Its a good thing that the money shot got over in the first five minutes because the rest of the movie is devoted to a cacophony of sight and sound that relentlessly assaults the senses...the only mercy coming in the form of an intermission too short and the random slomo shots too slow. The movie substitutes sight for sense and sound for dialogue  and it is such a shame to see to veteran Marathi actors such as Sachin Khedekar Ashok Saraf and a few others my bad I do not know their names prance around Devgan's Singham.So let's talk about the eponymous character  Bajirao Singham. An honest upright officer given to destroying public property and engaging in gymnastic fisticuffs he is played by Ajay Devgan. As a occasional break from the dishoomdishoom he also plays simpering lover to an even more simpering Kavya. In both roles he is completely over the top but at least one can say that he matches the overall tone of the movie  loud over the top and colorful. And that is NOT a compliment...really it isn't.Its very hard to believe that this is the same Devgan of Omkara and Company and Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai and even Bhoot. wasn't he the master of understated acting? I remember his eyes talking volumes in Omkara...here he lets his oversized biceps and his overtight trousers do ALL of the talking. Unfortunately there's a limit to how much they can talk. The rest is a yawning gap where a movie should have been.If I am not talking about the rest of the characters it is because there aren't any...they are just caricatures. Not even the villain played by Prakash Raj makes a mark. Its Devgan Devgan Devgan all the way.".

By that I mean the film is fairly lowbudget or at least middle of the road my guess is twenty million and it was shot on location in Brooklyn and places around. He also has a script that has its share of clichs and potential pitfalls for cinematic treatment. It's surprising how well the film comes off with the elements and they are ALL familiar the cop just nearing retirement Gere on his way out who has to shepherd a rookie through his first days on the a corrupted cop redundant mayhap that is scrounging for any money he can on raids Hawke needs it for a slightly noble cause a new house for his growing family a cop undercover Cheadle has to choose promotion or loyalty with a criminal takedown on the horizon.Three very recognizable types and the tropes are there at least on paper. But where Fuqua sets himself apart as he did to a good if not great extent on Training Day is to imbue importance not pretentious but just enough for serious effect in the direction of scenes and in casting. The actors take material that could be trite and unconvincing and even stale postLumetcopmovie stuff and make it their own compelling and heartfelt and true to the extent that the genre allows. There's real tragedy felt with Hawke's character albeit he may overact just a bit in some scenes since this corrupt cop wouldn't be so bad if he could get what he needs I don't want God's forgiveness I want his help he says in confession and likewise real conflict with Cheadle's undercover who has been embedded too long in the trenches and wants to help the criminal who once saved his life Wesley Snipes fantastic in an older slightly wiser version of his character in New Jack City.And then there's Gere. One almost forgets Gere's successes when he's starring in romanticcomedy junk like... well what's he been in recently for starters. But then one looks at Unfaithful Days of Heaven The Hoax I'm Not There among some others and one sees Gere is an underrated presence a guy who when given material to shine in does very well as an everyman more than just a typical pretty star. With his role as the onhiswayout cop he gives one of his best performances worn and weary but strong and good as a cop whenever he can see fit who at one point makes a mistake that he won't cop to watch Gere when he's interrogated about his rookie's mishap on a convenience store scuffle and it's something of genius work. It's intense and believable and even tender and sorrowful work like when Gere's character is around a prostitute he's fallen for.Back to Fuqua though  this is a filmmaker who knows what he's working in and wants to transcend it. Perhaps his idol for this kind of production was Sidney Lumet with his cop films make something dramatic and tragic and never lose the grit but add panache with the directing. He knows the conventions and has to stick to them sometimes for weaker or just expected effect. But watching his style in that last reel when all three stories that have been going back and forth ocassionally intertwined come together at one project building. There's a scene where Hawke is personally raiding a place. Watch the camera in this scene where it stays put in one spot for seemingly a minute. It could almost be a Tarantino move something selfconscious but purposeful for the action the psychology of the emotion of the scene. His work with better material would be astonishing. As it is it's just good inventive filmmaking.".

	schema:headline " Could have been a classic";
	schema:reviewBody "Brooklyn's Finest is clichd cop film only in setup not in execution. The scripting and a plethora of strong performance elevate the familiar veins that make up the films structure. In fact three of the most standardorder plot lines are utilized and undercover cop who blurs the line between righteous and corrupt a drug cop who exhibits no blurring in his corruption and an aging veteran slugging it through his last week on the job. These cops are played by Don Cheadle Ethan Hawk and Richard Gere respectively and each gets equal screen time in a triple thread story that eventually converge on one fateful night.Director Antoine Fuqua's latest treads a thin line between tragic and gritty and outright depressing. This is a gloomy film to be sure everyone is either a cop murderer drug dealer or prostitute sometimes many of the above and there is no glimpse of sunshine so to speak in Fuqua's Brooklyn. I am a big fan of Fuqua from his John Wooesquire debut with The Replacement Killers to the classic cop drama Training Day to the very underrated Bruce Willis war actionier Tears of the Sun he is more than a competent auteur and always brings out solid performances from his leads.Hawk who plays the increasingly corrupt Sal is perhaps the strongest of three leads but Gere and Cheadle are very convincing in their roles as well. Unfortunately despite the admirable development of these characters the aforementioned ordinary narrative leaves little question about where their respective paths are headed. We also get a blazing comeback from the one and only Wesley Snipes as a criminal and friend of Cheadle's Tango. Rounding off the talented main players are Brian F. O'Byrne as Sal's fellow cop and friend and Will Patton as Tango's lone remaining contact to the just world he feels is fading away. As I have iterated many times it is the stellar work from the key players that makes Brooklyn's Finest worth your time.The drive behind these three cops is equally compelling. Sal has 5 kids with 6 and 7 on the way and is swimming in debt. Through a realestate contact he sets up a deal to move his growing family to a larger house only if he can get the big score of drug money he needs. As the date approaches for him to come up with the money he grows increasingly desperate. Gere's Eddie is a burntout cop who has all but lost respect for the job and his fellow cops have all but lost respect for him. His only remaining duty is to escort a rookie around for his final 7 days but things go far less smoothly then he could have hoped. Finally there is Tango a UC who has lost all his ties to the real world. His wife is filing for divorce and he wants to be made detective first grade a.s.a.p. and spend the remainder of his days behind a comfortable desk and away from a life of crime. In one of the best sequences Tango is asked why the sudden urge to get out. He tells of a night where he was pulled over by the cops for speeding and legitimately considered killing them. He wants out.If only the despair had been laid on a little less thick and the stereotypes that make up the three main characters polished with a bit more inventiveness Brooklyn's Finest could have been a classic in the making.

What they each share is the New York Police Department as a workplace.Life isn't perfect  it never is. We always have to give something up in order to do something else  it's called choice. Therein lies man's fatal freedom.Sal Ethan Hawke gave up the possibility for flash when he became a cop. He has a growing family with numerous kids but lives in a decrepit rundown house where the wood mold is causing his pregnant wife lung problems. His NYPD salary isn't sufficient for him to move to a different abode.Can we judge him? It is a context that bears for some humanity from our part. He will do things in the film but it is difficult for us to point our fingers from a high horse for we aren't in his situation. Does the end justify the means? While doing undercover work in prison Tango Don Cheadle is saved from death by an inmate Casanova Philips Wesley Snipes. The event forms a bond between them. Now Casanova is back out and the force want Tango to send him back in. By taking this shortcut to Detective first grade read becoming an undercover agent Tango is forced to deal with harsh consequences namely the fact that his wife is in the process of leaving him and that other than Casanova he has no friends.Eddie Richard Gere is retiring and is a morally decadent seemingly useless member of the force. He gets teased by his younger coworker cops and seems fed up with his life. We see him put a revolver to his mouth in the morning.Even though he is 7 days away from retirement he must take care of young rookies fresh faces new to the NYPD. Eddie doesn't get along well with them.It is unclear what happened to his wife but Eddie now seeks solace in the womanly comforts of a lowly Chinatown hooker.These grotesquely authentic lives are laid out with the aid of a soundtrack that simultaneously sets the pace and follows the psychological states of the main protagonists. The tone of the music will change for instance when a particular character is in a tight situation a situation where he is again confronted with choice.All the actors in this film pull off magnificently intense portrayals. Especially worthy of mention are Cheadle Snipes Gere and Hawke  who once again shows that he can enter the mind of a struggling cop like no other.A steadypaced involving thriller definitely worth a gander. 810.".

Brooklyn's Finest is a gloomy and bitter police story with a cast that is a constellation of stars some of them with minor parts. I watched this film with great expectations but unfortunately the screenplay is not original too long and sometimes confused. The three stories are very well known by viewers of this genre and the narrative is cold without emotions. The director Antoine Fuqua could or should have made a better feature with the available budget and cast. My vote is six.Title Brazil Atrados Pelo Crime Attracted by the Crime".

The director Antoine Fuqua could or should have made a better feature with the available budget and cast. My vote is six.Title Brazil Atrados Pelo Crime Attracted by the Crime";

Lives have fallen apart the personal lives of these cops. The script makes it clear that the job is rough on cop families it makes this point almost to the point of overkill.The women of this film are resigned to the belief that its a man's world. They have bought this belief system almost totally. And yes I include Ellen Barkin's middleaged superbosscop because she tries to be just like men in order to get to the top of this man's macho cop worldunderworld environment.Gere is subtle very nuanced and effective in his role. Hawke is incredibly explosive in his role of a man desperately overstrung or at least in need of a good vacation. Cheadle's mixedup abouttosnap performance works perfectly with Snipes who gives a fine mature theatrical style performance. I'm ready to see more of the mature Snipes as his career progresses.All the acting here is great and it overcomes the generally seen it before nature of the production. This is basically similar to Greek tragedy so if you view it that way you won'be let down by the relentless grimness that is here from start to finish. Entertainment value highlighted by enough tension plus the studied pro performances rate an 8 rating from me.".

	schema:reviewBody "Would you steal bread to feed your family? As Dwight from The Office  would say it's a trick question. The bread is poisoned. Also it's  not your real family. You've been cuckolded by a stronger smarter  male. For Sal Ethan Hawke a dirty narcotics officer in Brooklyn's  Finest the answer is clear. Only instead of bread he is stealing drug  money and killing anyone who gets in the way. He needs the money  because his pregnant wife is sick from the mold in their home so he  needs to pay the down payment on another house he is going to buy.  Hawke plays the role with great intensity just as he did in director  Antoine Fuqua's previous movie Training Day. In that he costarred  with Denzel Washington only Denzel was the dirty cop and Hawke played  the rookie officer who didn't like what he saw. He got an Oscar  nomination for that role but is just as good if not better in this  movie.  Sal is just one of the three conflicted cops who walk a fine line  between cop and criminal. One is Eddie Richard Gere who is days away  from retirement and has what is probably the most eventful week of his  career. His job is to oversee rookies in the mean streets and sticks a  gun in his mouth a couple of times throughout the course of the movie.  His only sources of pleasures are his whiskey and frequent visits with  a hooker.  The other is Tango Don Cheadle an undercover cop who is so deep into  the criminal life that he struggles with his own identity. He's been  asking for a desk job for years and desperately wants out of the drug  beat. The only way he can get out and receive a promotion is by  betraying a close criminal friend Caz Wesley Snipes.  The problem with movies like Brooklyn's Finest is that they often fail  to add any depth to their characters in the midst of all the mindless  violence. But the great acting from Hawke Gere and Cheadle separates  this one from the crowd and makes it a watchable action thriller. And  while may not be as good as Training Day it still shows the rough side  of being a cop and that they may not be as innocent as they appear to  be.".

Martin we have many interesting scenes of moral disjunctive fights with the conscience and impossible decisions.But the problem is that that structure feels a bit diffuse and I could not find the point in common which impulses the three stories this movie tells besides of the ethical conflicts the three main characters face.In other words I was interested in the characters and their dilemmas but the secondary scenes which may add texture and realism to the story tired me a little bit because they divide our attention without a justifiable cause and they unnecessarily stretch the movie.In spite of that I liked the film mainly because of Fuqua's solid direction which is always disciplined and absolutely free of any tricks which are not necessary in order to create suspense.As for the cast Ethan Hawke feels a bit over the top in his character while on the other hand Don Cheadle is perfect as a cop whose divided loyalty is not because of simple ambition but because of the lessons life has brought him in both sides of the law.Richard Gere could interpret even asleep the character of a veteran who is tired of fighting an endless war but I think he keeps doing it well.As for the supporting cast I liked the performances from Will Patton as the classical suit who only wants results Ellen Barkin as a coppolitician who is more interested in her career than in the fulfillment of justice and Wesley Snipes who makes his return to mainstream cinema after various years of starring in atrocious action movies made straight to DVD.As a comparison point I liked Brooklyn's Finest more than Pride and Glory but less than Narc and Dark Blue because they had had more concise and compact screenplays.However despite the fails from the screenplay and the fact it is not highly memorable I can recommend Brooklyn's Finest as an interesting cop flick with good performances and interesting ideas.".

The movie relies on perpetuating all kinds of stereotypes to move the story along and suggests a level of corruption and violence that if plausible would render our society inoperable. Yet the story works mainly due to the great acting and the fast paced action which manages to keep the audience's attention. One is kept wondering how the various subplots will work themselves out and who will survive the maelstrom that engulfs all concerned.

	schema:reviewBody "Wow. You know how sometimes watching a movie feels like being immersed in a different world? Brooklyn's Finest is like that and that different world is like the twilight zone. It's just like our world but there's something horribly wrong about it. In this twilight zonecalled Brooklyn everyone is selfish and aggressive violence is everywhere and there's a constant level of tension in the air. Talk about depressing. Walking out of the theater was like breathing air again for the very first time. It felt good but what does that say about the movie?OverviewIn Brooklyn's Finest right and wrong have very little to do with anything. There are no heroes and no villainsonly actions and motives. The film follows the stories of three Brooklyn cops and puts their lives under the microscope revealing the innerconflicts that are broiling beneath the surface. Each cop is trapped in a figurative cage of their own making Be careful what you wish for and the overarcing story is about their struggles to escape and the consequences that follow.Looking at the plot the film doesn't follow any standard Hollywood formula and it doesn't meet the expectations it cultivates in the first half. You might expect plot points to twist and tie together brilliantly at the end but they don't. They get close to each other but barely touch. The tension doesn't ratchet up and lead into an explosive climax. Instead it felt fairly constant throughout the movie. In a way the filmmaking style is transparent and doesn't try to manipulate the audience at all. Everything just is.Brooklyn's Finest is an exploration of motive and violence in a seedy culture that I'm not sure actually exists. If dark pseudorealistic crime dramas intrigue you then give this one a try. Moviegoers looking for a standard Hollywood Blockbuster fix may be disappointed however.CastOne reason to consider seeing this movie is the acting. The leads are all operating out of their comfort zonesRichard Gere is lacking his usual sophistication still has a thing for prostitutes though Don Cheadle is thuggish and aggressive Ethan Hawke is hardened and speaks with grit in his voice and Wesley Snipes is well not an action hero. They all succeed in delivering convincing performances that feel true to life and I enjoyed that.How to enjoy this movie Expect to walk into a dirty world full of depression prostitution drugs and violence. Focus on the subtle character acting. Keep your eye out for what's righter and what's wronger. You'll know what I mean after the first 20 seconds. The remaining two hours of the movie are all exempli gratia cases in point.Weak points The plot's not brilliant and doesn't culminate in some amazingly clever climax. The ending doesn't entirely resolve in a satisfying way. You may want to take antidepression medication with you to the theater.".

The leads are all operating out of their comfort zonesRichard Gere is lacking his usual sophistication still has a thing for prostitutes though Don Cheadle is thuggish and aggressive Ethan Hawke is hardened and speaks with grit in his voice and Wesley Snipes is well not an action hero. They all succeed in delivering convincing performances that feel true to life and I enjoyed that.How to enjoy this movie Expect to walk into a dirty world full of depression prostitution drugs and violence. Focus on the subtle character acting. Keep your eye out for what's righter and what's wronger. You'll know what I mean after the first 20 seconds. The remaining two hours of the movie are all exempli gratia cases in point.Weak points The plot's not brilliant and doesn't culminate in some amazingly clever climax. The ending doesn't entirely resolve in a satisfying way. You may want to take antidepression medication with you to the theater.";

He is a master of intense moments in time but I believe many of his movies lack continuity. Brooklyn's Finest is no exception. The film follows the unconnected stories of three cops. Richard Gere is the stereotypical veteran cop who is one week from retirement and begins the film with a gun in his mouth. Ethan Hawke is the desperate young cop whose family just keeps growing his wife Lili Taylor is pregnant with twins and he longs to provide better arrangements. Don Cheadle is the undercover cop who if he hasn't already crossed the line is dangerously close.The best scenes are with Cheadle and Wesley Snipes who plays a just released from prison hardened criminal. Their dialogue rings true for an undercover cop trying to play both sides and remember what's right. If not for Ellen Barkin's histrionics the worst scenes would be watching Richard Gere show off his full repertoire of three different facial expressions. Poor Ethan Hawke looks like no one let him eat or shower for 2 months prior to filming. The boy looks sad.Even though we know it's coming the final act where the three stories intersect is pretty interesting and make for a satisfying shootemup ending. Brace yourself for some hardcore street violence and language and a meandering soundtrack. The film funnels to the point that there is a very fine line between right and wrong for law enforcement types. I prefer to keep the faith that this is a serious exaggeration.".

I recall him saying that the film was really really good. he's someone that's rather hard to please in terms of movies So as I go to put the movie in I sent him a message asking if this was the film he liked. He said I did like it but a few things happened that really irritated me so it wound up just being okay. I took that with a grain of salt because like I said he's hard to please. But I also kept it in mind while watching the film. Everything was filmed well dialogue characters and situations were all complex and interesting...then comes the end. The last 15 minutes of the film has our three main police characters all cross paths but never actually meet in one apartment project. One is there because he desperately needs money for his family so he goes on a killing rampage looking for drug money and he finds it. Then he finds two bullets into his back for his troubles. Our next character was the undercover cop who was having great difficulty with choosing his career by setting up the man who saved his life but also the man he was sent to put away or tipping said man off and letting him get away. But said man gets killed in a driveby. So our undercover character got his promotion for all the evidence he had gathered up to that point and didn't have the guilt of having to arrest the man who saved his life. So what's he do? He goes on a killing rampage against the people who did the driveby and is in turn shot twice in the back by an officer arriving on the scene...which made no sense because he had already finished shooting everybody the officer made no attempts to tell him to freeze or drop his gun the cop just bloody shoots him!Lastly we have our burnedout retired cop who was on the verge of committing suicide until he sees one final act of redemption and decides after a career of minding his own business and keeping his head down that it was time to step up and he winds up rescuing three captive prostitutes and killing one of their captors in the process...then the movie ends.I still really enjoyed the film I still recommend it but if you haven't seen it yet and have read this far you know how it ends so I say watch it for the first two acts and at least you'll know what to expect from the ending perhaps it won't bother you as much as it did me. I plan to watch this again in the near future to see if maybe the ending won't bother me as much.".

	schema:reviewBody "I mean WTF?????? So many better cop films are getting their main plots stolen from them wholesale...Cop counting the days to retirement trying to get out alive while being ridiculed by younger cops that's Robert Duvall's character in Falling Down! Another cop trying to get out of the st of undercover work The Departed! Yet another cop stealing drug money to try and fix his dire situation. Denzel Washington in Training Day. Not the same details mind you but close enough and that movie was made by the same fuquing director and that movie was great!The script is god awful! Practically every single possible piece of dialog that has ever been said in every possible cop movie that has ever been made has been said in this movie.Granted the first 23 of the film isn't that bad it just seemed like your basic MAJOR suspensionofdisbelieftype blockbuster but once you get to the third act you'd practically have to lobotomize yourself to be able to grasp the amount of bullst that takes place.Richard Gere walking towards the camera freezeframe fade to black? What is that supposed to mean????? Even though Don Cheadle's and Ethan Hawke's characters were killed they weren't killed in the line of duty and their families probably won't receive their 100000 insurance payouts notwithstanding the felonies they were both in the middle of committing. Also the film seemed to forget that Richard Gere's character was retired! Even though he saved those 3 girls' lives he probably would've still gone to jail for murder and vigilantism! Not to mention that had Cheadle and Hawke survived at the end they both would've been discovered for their respective crimes and did hard time as well! I mean does this fuquing director know anything about the law? Ok I'll stop making fun of the director's name for being so close to that other word that I can't type here. But after seeing that ending I wanted that fuquer to give me my 2 hours back!The only redeeming quality about this film is that somehow they were able to get such a great group of actors together yet every single character is so poorly written to say that the characters were onedimensional would be a compliment! Had this film been made with noname actors this would've been considered the worst cop film of all time hands down. However since it had such great actors attached to it it's only destined to be known as a blatantly unoriginal cop movie with a clich script that drastically mistreats it's talented cast.In simple Hollywood terms Brooklyn's Finest is to cop films what Envy was to comedy. Look for my review on Envy to see what I mean. Avoid it.".

	onyx:emotionText "I mean WTF?????? So many better cop films are getting their main plots stolen from them wholesale...Cop counting the days to retirement trying to get out alive while being ridiculed by younger cops that's Robert Duvall's character in Falling Down! Another cop trying to get out of the st of undercover work The Departed! Yet another cop stealing drug money to try and fix his dire situation. Denzel Washington in Training Day. Not the same details mind you but close enough and that movie was made by the same fuquing director and that movie was great!The script is god awful! Practically every single possible piece of dialog that has ever been said in every possible cop movie that has ever been made has been said in this movie.Granted the first 23 of the film isn't that bad it just seemed like your basic MAJOR suspensionofdisbelieftype blockbuster but once you get to the third act you'd practically have to lobotomize yourself to be able to grasp the amount of bullst that takes place.Richard Gere walking towards the camera freezeframe fade to black? What is that supposed to mean????? Even though Don Cheadle's and Ethan Hawke's characters were killed they weren't killed in the line of duty and their families probably won't receive their 100000 insurance payouts notwithstanding the felonies they were both in the middle of committing. Also the film seemed to forget that Richard Gere's character was retired! Even though he saved those 3 girls' lives he probably would've still gone to jail for murder and vigilantism! Not to mention that had Cheadle and Hawke survived at the end they both would've been discovered for their respective crimes and did hard time as well! I mean does this fuquing director know anything about the law? Ok I'll stop making fun of the director's name for being so close to that other word that I can't type here. But after seeing that ending I wanted that fuquer to give me my 2 hours back!The only redeeming quality about this film is that somehow they were able to get such a great group of actors together yet every single character is so poorly written to say that the characters were onedimensional would be a compliment!

I'm not sure how many of the people writing these reviews worked on the movie but I would venture to guess it's close to 100. This was most likely a combination of 3 scripts to make 1 movie  the only problem is that all 3 of those scripts sucked. When you see the opening scene of Gere hopefully you'll laugh at the clich of 12 Riggs 12 Murtaugh and that will carry you for the 2 hours of Brooklyn's Finest. There is one genius scene with Gere and a prostitute where he talks about a rookie cop he's taking around. But I'll let you see that scene so you can laugh the whole ride home with your friends. I love Cheadle Hawke Gere and Snipes in general. On their own they've done a lot of good movies  but this one didn't work. Too many story lines with no development no twists and a complete downer. I don't feel very good after this movie. If the goal of this movie was to make you humble and to look at life with a greater respect  it does nothing but make you depressed. Luckily I can laugh this one off. Wish it was better really do.".

	schema:headline " Stirring depiction of cops on the edge this may just be Fuqua's Finest.";
	schema:reviewBody "Brooklyn's Finest tells three respective tales of a trio of very different people more broadly connected to the police force of New York City three people who each alike want 'out' of their respective lives and lifestyles within the force three people who live and operate in very different capacities therein the force but look forward to the new ventures and pastures to follow thereafter their leaving. The film is a masterstroke of crime drama storytelling a film whose runtime is never too long and whose sheer scale is never overwhelming a film whose ability to balance each strand ranging from everyday 'onthebeat' cops to undercover narcotics agents is close to faultless. As far as American thrillers that may or may not contain a good deal of second unit stuff go it is a breath of fresh air an appealing story driven piece with any one of its three strands most likely making decent enough features on their own.Director Antoine Fuqua establishes the uncompromising characteristics that dominate the nature of his film's world during the opening scene an exchange set in the confines of a parked car in the dead of night. One man speaks to another about how he was justified in recently breaking the law out of self defence. The other man Ethan Hawke's Detective named Sal Procida then proceeds to shoot him dead but only for the large amount of illgotten money he had with him  something which will ease his financial woes made apparent out of his unhealthy wife and large family who're all living in a building unfit for them. Above anything else it is a perfect opening to Procida's strand a strand built on moral grey areas and he loots and kills for sake of someone else's struggles. Waking up not so far away is Richard Gere's character he too is a police officer named Eddie Dugan a single man who sleeps with whisky beside his bed and unloads an empty pistol into his mouth upon getting up. The man is not far from retirement and in a bad state. Finally Don Cheadle is an undercover narcotics agent named Tango Butler a man deep in the world of housing projectset African American run drug rings whose efficiency and professionalism is epitomised in a slick singular take as the camera glides through their interior base of operations from the quasi perspective of Cheadle himself.Fuqua toys with his audience in so much he allows for the least intelligent least likable and probably most aggressive of the three in Procida to want what's best for other people moreover himself. In providing this character with a family it allows for Hawke's character to occupy the screen without risk of our interest or fondness for the man waning it allows for his story to play out without the danger of it transferring into an anonymous bland tale of an antihero undeserving of his job title going through the motions. That's not to say his is the best of the three for Butler's story about working undercover and the apparent brethren he shares with those shady delinquents as relationships with his police superiors wane is often shattering. Wanting away from this life of constant fear and danger he learns the only way to do such a thing is to bring in the boss of the entire outfit Wesley Snipes' gangster named Caz.The reemergence of Snipes is a curious detail a man who himself has recently served time in prison and here plays someone who is fresh out and back amongst his kin anyway. Seeing him turn up carries with it an odd air of realism as if akin to his character suddenly reappearing amidst his own here on set so too is Caz the wanted man who can finally be nailed by a federal department if Butler plays it right. In this regard the casting is a masterstroke and it is impressive that the sudden reappearance of the actor does not soften the impact of the film up to this point nor beyond it.There are thoughts and writings that in recent years and something born out of the events of 911 in New York City those more broadly orientated towards jobs in the fire department or police force often always come in for heroic depictions when featuring in American films. Some the likes of Ladder 49 and such have almost exclusively revolved around said folk in said roles. Jim Sheridan's 2010 remake of a Danish film entitled Brothers inexplicably featured a composition of a fire station faade during its opening montage a shot you might say was designed subconsciously or otherwise to implement both a sad and romanticised tone from the off. The film is not about firemen  far from it but it's meant to induce melancholia what better way than to exploit the iconography of a fire station. If you want to see it in this particular way you might read Fuqua's film as a piece going past all of that and cutting to the grit of the thing a New York Cityset project about those in roles depicted in less than flattering ways and living less than heroic lifestyles where previously we've witnessed otherwise. However you might see it the film is a more than substantial effort .".

	schema:reviewBody "David Ayer probably wishes he wrote this movie instead of going on to do butcher an amazing James Elroy story and turn it into the painfully interesting Street Kings.Brooklyn's Finest is dark gritty and brutal. The opening scene is the biggest indication. You get character development chatting and not going into plot and what is going to happen next and then you get a bullet through the skull. This shows you what you're in for. Story with violence driving it.The three main cops Gere Hawke and Cheadle are vastly different from each other. Gere plays a veteran pushing retirement who drinks away his past and only adds to his pain and has a vice that would he perfect for the vice squad. Hawke plays a very Denzel inTraining Daylike character the major difference is that Hawke's character rationalizes his actions as a means to better his family life. Cheadle is probably the least corrupt of the three and is the character with the larger moral conflict. The three do not ever work together once throughout the film and their paths cross at multiple occasions but mainly in the finale.Wesley Snipes is amazing here. His character is very reminiscent of Nio from New Jack City but much more grounded and less neonoir. Wesley makes a very good bad guy and the way he stares at characters commands fear and respect. Ellen Barkin in a small role is very much an amazing ice queen who isn't afraid to tell you to your face she will blackmail you as she is in bed with you.Antoine Fuqua had amazing success with Training Day and since has been really been receiving underrated praise for his direction. Tears of the Sun and Shooter were films that I enjoyed fully. His style is almost homage like. Crane shots medium shots very little tracking and cutbacks. It works because it helps tell the story and show reactions. Fuqua has an amazing talent for using brutal violence and not being shy about it. Bullets penetrate and exit a body with blood spurting out but it isn't to a shock value effect as much as just to emphasize the brutality of the story.Storywise the separate stories that finally intersect is used well here as these are three unique characters with their own unique story. The ending is somewhat shocking and predictable but it leaves you satisfied. If I may be so bold it is almost a commentary for racial tension that many New Yorkers exists within the NYPD and the racism that is very much there as well.Unlike Street Kings Brooklyn's Finest doesn't type cast nor does it miscast it's actors. Everyone plays their roles perfectly and Richard Gere gives his darkest performance ever.If you enjoyed Training Day and wanted more this is for you.".

Khan portrays a solid character who has both comical and dramatic moments beautifully acted by him.  And Madhuri who won a best actress award for this role delivers a great performance. The soundtrack is very good thanks to the exceptional voice of Udit Narayan whose smile you can hear through the music. I gave this movie 5 starts instead of 4 because I have such fond memories of watching it when it came out in 1990.  But compared to other Bollywood movies it should really be a 4.".

I find many Hindi films to be slow and boring but not this one.Films such as Dilwale Dulhanie Le Jayenge Taal Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam and Dil To Pagal Hai turned out to be hits. To be quite honest I found these films to be so slow and boring I nearly fell asleep halfway through. Dil is not a boring film. It is a great entertaining emotional film a mustsee. So romantic.

Either way the pairing was fresh and the audiences flocked to the cinema halls to make this film the biggest hit of the year.The story in a nutshell was that of Anupam Kher who runs a tiny shop buying old newspapers but wants his only son Raja Aamir Khan to get married to a rich businessman's Sayeed Jaffery daughter Madhu Madhuri Dixit. He even tricks Jaffery into believing that he himself is a rich business tycoon. Initially Raja and Madhu cannot stand each other but soon they fall in love only to their parents opposing to the alliance once Jaffery discovers the truth about Anupam Kher. Will Raja and Madhu unite? The film has everything that a good entertainer during the 90s demanded. Comedy action drama romance and good songs. Director Indra Kumar received a well deserved nomination for this film while Madhuri Dixit bagged her first filmfare award.Music directors AnandMilind continued their top phase with this film which was the best music of the year until Aashiqui and NadeemShravan decided to rewrite history. Nevertheless the songs of the film were extremely popular and continue to be popular till date. This is one of the few albums where all the songs were a hit.All in all Dil is a good entertainer and a recommended watch. Go for it!".

The movie is great to watch amazing for college kids form any era the film is fantastic the songs are amazing the whole vibe is so young and hip. It has all the cool hip college stuff about parties and bunking classes in the beginning and in the end it turns into something like a romantic coming of age adventure where the hero amir khan and heroine madhuri live their life somehwere else well complemented by a song. There is even a rape scene inbetween after which their love begins much better then beating up thugs an excellent change for the Indian cinema at that time. We can see that the way the move goes was probably inspired by some American movies perpahps grease however the movies tempo was also taken up in johar and yash movies i.e. a comic beginning a sad middle and a happy end. Very nicely done spectacular the characters are what they should. Amir and Madhuri look excellent for the role both were young they still are at the time and did their parts with true honesty. Same goes for others and each character changed from a comic to aserious one in the later HALF of the movie. Brilliant just brilliant".

Since the year it released i.e. 1997 no other film has been like this to me till now. My extreme liking for DTPH is because of following reasons.. Its tag line i.e someone somewhere...is made for you. Its story line and Yash Chopra's perfection as a director. Its superb music by Uttam Singh and Lata Mangeshkar's melodious duets with Udit Narayan.I love its songs and Lata's voice seems to be freshereven more than old songs of her Uttam singh's background instruments rock whenever i listen to the numbers. Shahrukh Khan's first performance in which he did not stammer and did not deliver dialogs in the way like he earlier used to.He was very serious and his acting was quitecalm and mature.For the same reason he got several awards for this film. Madhuri's performance was great and so was of Karisma.Both got awards and Karisma also got a well deserved Rashtriya PuraskarNational Award. I love its screenplay specially in the scenes having an acting stage within the film.See its climax to confirm what i said. MUST SEE IT AFTER READING MY COMMENTS IF YOU ARE NOT AGREE WITH ME.".

Call it illfate or whatever post Yash raj practically every topactress begins her journey towards exit. Akshay Kumar His cameo was supposed to be the surprise element which later on many copied. He was extremely raw in terms of performance but hey he got the best song the title song. Aruna Irani Another important cameo which was effectively incorporated into the storyline as an important coginthewheel. And she delivered the goods to the utmost satisfaction.Music is one of the strongpoints of DTPH. A couple of listens and they linger on for years to come. When it comes to Yashraj the lyrics from Anand Bakshi are a notch above the his usual. Playback from Lata was at its angelic best and perhaps the last!. Costumes wardrobe were aesthetically beautiful. Manmohan Singh carries his signature style when it comes to DOP. Choreography was different from the Shiamak Davar group. Special mention is deserved for the story screenplay  dialogues. Finally the best part was the opening credits which truly communicates the entire message of the movie  simply awesome.

Dil To Pagal Hai is like a 100 Indian television soap operas stitched together. Dil To Pagal Hai is an eyewash a shame to the original cinema.It is a superficially hyped movie with 'King' Khan doing the lead role. Sharugh Khan is an entertainer at best. He don't know the first letter of acting. He is superficially over ratedto put it lightly just like his films. You should see his acting in emotional scenes I always felt like he is some kind of an epilepsy patient. He does strange things with his face whenever there is an emotional scene and that is not called acting that is overacting. A big thumbs down to all those who felt this movie was 'great'. Sorry for my language but I can't help it.".

	schema:headline " A bright musical gem";
	schema:reviewBody "Dil To Pagal Hai is a wonderfully made movie  entertaining impressive and romantic. I appreciate the fact that Chopra kept updating his style with every new film. This is one film in which the songs are mostly a part of the storyline and the movie can be rightly described as a romantic musical and not just because it's Bollywood. Where the music goes Uttam's soundtrack is totally excellent but more than anything the way in which the songs are presented is exemplary. This film actually bears the stamp of Hindi cinema's immense talent in making musicals. No one can do it better and that's not about the choreography or the technical brilliance it's more about the soul. The numbers are evidently very well invested the foremost example being the very first song Le Gayee which is a part of the show and a great opening spectacularly danced and are really fun to watch but there's something else in there a kind of charm that is hard to explain in words.Dil To Pagal Hai indulges in its romanticism but what I found great about it is its totally realistic portrayal of young artists. Chopra strikes an amazing balance between contemporary culture and poetic romanticism. While some of the dialogue is a bit cheesy most of it is actually very real and has some sense of everyday reality. Chopra portrays the troupe of Shahrukh as a totally modern one while the character of Madhuri and her soft romantic nature is actually deprecated even by some of the characters in the film itself. But the whole theory of the film which tries to convey a message that somewhere someone is made for you is quite interesting and inspiring despite its cheesiness. The film is never overly melodramatic or gushing in its emotional quotient. It tries to present itself as a simple love story which does not work with a largerthanlife story but rather an episode in which true romance comes in the middle of happygolucky hardlyromantic people.The story itself may actually be one of the film's weakest links but the script and the execution along with the technical brilliance and the soul which the director injects it with elevate the picture to an altogether different level. Yash Chopra should be remembered for his ability to make a film with a stale story and yet infuse it with newfound energy. He in a way proved at that time that one need not make a sobby melodrama in order to make a good film. Dil To Pagal Hai is high on production values  the art direction is fantastic and the cinematography is very good. As mentioned above the songs actually work well with the film's story because it is about dancers. My favourite dance performance which is also one of my favourite moments in the film is the Dance of Envy between Madhuri and Karisma which is astonishingly gripping and reminiscent of Sridevi's amazing Moments of Rage number from Chopra's Lamhe and here too there's a certain psychological tension which is very well handled.Where acting goes Madhuri Dixit is the perfect Hindi film heroine  beautiful gentle charming and a stupendous dancer. Here she is wonderful as Pooja proving you don't have to cry buckets and scream ceaselessly to deliver a completely good performance. She's dreamy and innocent and there's something genuinely sincere about the way she delivers many of her clichd dialogues which could have easily made any other actress look cheesy and embarrassing. Shahrukh Khan is excellent and typically energetic. Yes this is not a Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa or a Dil Se in which he had rich complex roles but his character is very good within the parameters of this film and he is thoroughly convincing. Akshay Kumar in what sadly is one of his best roles at that time is very efficient and suitably restrained. Yet without a doubt the show is totally stolen by Karisma Kapoor in a brilliantly selfassured performance full of passion and emotional commitment. She is totally there expressive heartfelt and extremely impressive in her dance numbers.I know many disagree with me on this one for all I care but I think it deserves great praise for handling a cheesy subject with sophistication and style. Dil To Pagal Hai is classic Bollywood entertainment  lighthearted positive and with a slight touch of a new India which must have been very refreshing for those times. Personally I may be a little biased since it does hold some nostalgic value for me but even watching it today I loved the spectacular numbers the melodious songs long live Lata Mangeshkar Asha Bhosle and the whole team of wonderful playback singers assigned to the brilliant soundtrack the modern characters and even the love story which is efficiently incorporated into the stage shows showing how art imitates life and vice versa within the film.".

But one day Nisha's leg sprains and doctor says that she shouldn't dance for 3 months. This is shocking news to the crew as they are having another play in 2 weeks time. So they search for another heroine and finds Pooja. Rahul immediately falls in love with Pooja but Pooja is in doubt as Pooja was brought up by another family whose son Akshay is in love with her and she cannot refuse him due to debt. Now Pooja should make a choice a very important choice whether she should marry the true love she had found or she should pay her debt to the family which brought her up by marrying their son......Good story. Good theme. Makes you think that someone....somewhere..is made for you. Shahrukh and Madhuri as usual excel well in their roles and Karishma and Akshay do well.

	schema:headline " The House of Chopra Descends";
	schema:reviewBody "Yash Chopra has oft been noted for his bold dramas masterful characterizations and resonating romances. Who indeed can forget the battle of wills between Amitabh and Shahi Kapoor in Deewar or the palatable devastation of Sanjeev Kumar and Jaya Bachchan in Silsila or the magical majesty of Sridevi in the Rajasthani deserts of Lamhe? Chopra reached the pinnacle of creativity with Lamhe in 1991. The downward slump which followed was perhaps inevitable but definitely regrettable. Parampara was intermittently enjoyable thanks in large part to Aamir Khan. Darr had all the requisite ingredients for success and is certainly his best film postLamhe but lacked the taut quality a thriller requires. Shah Rukh Khan was still engaged in quality roles at that point and succeeded in stealing the limelight from Juhi Chawla who played the protagonist famously referred to as KKKKiran.But alas. If the house of Chopra had attempted different themes in Kabhie Kabhi Silsila Waqt Deewar Chandni Lamhe Aaina and Darr it failed to break any substantial artistic ground with the flossy and flaccid nonevent called Dil To Pagal Hai.In fact it is so glaringly insipid that one cannot compare it to the repertoire which bears the name Chopra. Its clear predecessor is another film. One cannot help but draw parallels between DTPH and Sooraj Barjatya's heinously contrived Hindu Family Values farce Hum Aapke Hain Kaun both films are driven by their songs costume changes and familial uptopias. There is no story no plot and outside Karishma Kapoor's spraining her ankle no significant occurrence in the entire 180 minutes. There is littleif anydepth to the characters. Ms. Dixit is present in both playing the same girl with different names who is burdened with a unique form of arrested mental development in which she suffocates her own desire in deference to the will of her extended family who in both cases is eager to marry her off to her brotherinlaw Mohnish Bahl in HAHK or her adoptive brother Akshay Kumar in DTPH. A curious tipping of the hat to the idea of incest indeed. Of course fans of Ms. Dixit have seen her umpteen times before in potbolier love triangles Saajan Mohabbat Arzoo Dil Tera Aasiq HAHK Wajood Koyla Yaaraana Rajkumar KhalNayak Sahibaan Hum Tumhare Hain Sanam etc. etc. etc. Perhaps she was unaware that other types of films existed or that embodying misogynistic feminine ideals sucking limes and swishing her dupatta endlessly does not qualify as acting.Shah Rukh is little better off with a halfbaked and halfacted performance that has all the excitement of a dull thud. DTPH probably also marks the beginning of the descent of SRK's status as an actor. The joyous heights of Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa Baazigar and Raju Bangaya Gentleman are all distant memories. He had officially resigned his screen persona to the nondescript romantic hero RajRahul who has since been seen in Kuch Kuch Hota Hai Mohobbatein Kabhie Khushi Kabhi Gham and of course Veer Zaara. DTPH belongs in all of miniscule relevance to Karishma Kapoor. She is the only example of intelligence or artistry in the film stealing each and every scene in which she appears and garnering a welldeserved National Award. It is interesting that virtually every other leading actress in India at the time including Juhi Chawla Manisha Koirala Urmila Matondkar Raveena Tandon Tabu and even Kajol had rejected the role because it was deemed too insubstantial. Indeed it is the ONLY thing that is substantial in this attempt to oneup the hackedup and hackneyed Hum Aapke Hain Kaun!".

	onyx:emotionText "Yash Chopra has oft been noted for his bold dramas masterful characterizations and resonating romances. Who indeed can forget the battle of wills between Amitabh and Shahi Kapoor in Deewar or the palatable devastation of Sanjeev Kumar and Jaya Bachchan in Silsila or the magical majesty of Sridevi in the Rajasthani deserts of Lamhe? Chopra reached the pinnacle of creativity with Lamhe in 1991. The downward slump which followed was perhaps inevitable but definitely regrettable. Parampara was intermittently enjoyable thanks in large part to Aamir Khan. Darr had all the requisite ingredients for success and is certainly his best film postLamhe but lacked the taut quality a thriller requires. Shah Rukh Khan was still engaged in quality roles at that point and succeeded in stealing the limelight from Juhi Chawla who played the protagonist famously referred to as KKKKiran.But alas. If the house of Chopra had attempted different themes in Kabhie Kabhi Silsila Waqt Deewar Chandni Lamhe Aaina and Darr it failed to break any substantial artistic ground with the flossy and flaccid nonevent called Dil To Pagal Hai.In fact it is so glaringly insipid that one cannot compare it to the repertoire which bears the name Chopra.

Yash Chopra has given us many great films such as Deewar Silsila Kabhie Kabhie etc.  But this movie pretty much forced him into retirement.  His first movie of the 90s was Lamhe which was a complete flop whereas his second movie Darr would also have been a disaster if not for Shahrukh Khan.  When this film was released it became apparent that the man had completely run out of ideas.  It's your typical boy meets girl scenario in which nothing happens for three hours except for dancing and singing and overacting and lack of acting and phony complications until we get to a wellexecuted climax.  Shahrukh plays  drum roll please....himself!  He's good in most of the scenes except when it counts in which case he goes completely over the top.  Akshaye Kumar has really nothing to do until the end meaning he does nothing.  Karishma Kapoor is pretty good although her role isn't really that difficult.  The only one really worth watching is Madhuri who hits all the right notes and tries her best to save this film.  There are two good songs the title track and Are re.  The latter one is the standout.  All in all it's a styleoversubstance thing sure to make teenage girls go wild and win all the top awards which it did.  4 out of 10.  It will be interesting to see what Yash does for his comeback film.".

Don't know why I missed Dil To Pagal Hai which I got to watch after 18 years of release. Just like the movies I've named earlier this one is also to be cherished for the sheer beauty it perpetuates in the screen through the visuals pose costumes music songsand dances which are so mesmerizing that you crave more of them in the movie. Perhaps this is the charismatic direction of legend Yash Chopra which he has continued in his numerous movies.Storywise the film is a bit off beat from a regular romance. It deals with the confusion in commitment friendship love and couples made in heaven in which our four main protagonists are entwined which has been beautifully resolved by the end. At the beginning the film seems to lack a substance in its story which gets compensated pretty soon. The weakness of the film is its inability to develop the character artists in the backdrop. Shahrukh Khan and Madhuri Dixit deliver good performances for which they got the awards of the year. They have performed better in many movies but it's Karishma Kapoor who performs significant compared to her other movies. Akshay Kumar appears a bit weary and doesn't offer more than a guest appearance. Had the story carried a bit of substance to its glossy look the film could have found a better height.Rating 2.5 stars out of 4".

I have not seen a horror film which involved children that impressed me as much as this since Curse of the Cat People. The Innocents has just been knocked out of second spot by my viewing of this stylish film that puts The Other and The Others to shame. The film concerns young British teen Anna who suffers fainting spells and in her dreams visits the house which she had drawn on paper. As the dreams go on she meets a young male teen named Mark whom she had drawn in the window on paper. At first she couldn't get to visit his room  he tells her she has to go back and draw the stairs. I won't reveal more of the plot it would be doing the film a great disservice even though most viewers will probably be one step ahead. That's not a negative in this case as it enables one to be more attentive to the production design of Gemma Jackson and the direction of Bernard Rose which combine to depict incredibly stark visuals  there's no cheating with splashes of color and hazy or overlit photography that are often erroneously used to indicate a dreamlike state. Charlotte Burke will tear at your emotions as Anna a shame she made this her solo acting experience. Elliott Spiers is equally impressive as Mark but he only made one more film. Glenne Headly  a New London Connecticut native does remarkably well in her role as Anna's mother her accent is impeccable. This one is not to be missed.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was absolutely stunned while watching this fantasyhorror film.  The original plot has Anna an eleven year old girl with glandular fever sketching the crude drawing of a house during the opening scene.  As her fever worsens she repetedly dreams of the same house on an open field. In her dreams the house is brilliantly lit up and really looks like a child's drawing which I found a rather frightening image.  Anna dreams of adventures in the house with a boy named Marc and these adventures turn more sinister as her illness becomes more serious.  There seems to be a link between her illness and the evil she must face in the house but like many things in the movie this is only hinted at.In many ways I found this movie better than the book Marianne Dreams by Catherine Storr.  Although the book does contain some subtle horror it is basically for children.  However the movie offers some real scares as well as an underlying atmosphere of suppressed horror.  There is something unnerving in the scenes when Anna is exploring the empty house that is difficult to put your finger on.Perhaps the reason this amazing film wasn't a huge commercial success was because it's difficult to determine it's intended audience. While the character of Anna might appeal to preteens some scenes in particular the one when the father tries to break into the house with a hammer are far to intense for young children.  Most adults may be put off by the plot but if they're at all interested in child or dream psycology or just want to see something different I'd throughly reccomend it.".

The original plot has Anna an eleven year old girl with glandular fever sketching the crude drawing of a house during the opening scene.  As her fever worsens she repetedly dreams of the same house on an open field. In her dreams the house is brilliantly lit up and really looks like a child's drawing which I found a rather frightening image.

And the movie didn't disappoint though I still probably wouldn't call it a horror movie exclusively.11year old Anna Madden draws a house and visits it in her dreams. She is definitely asleep when she's seeing the house but it's so real in a sense that it's almost like a completely separate reality. Which in view of later events doesn't seem like a far cry from the truth. Anyhow she finds she can add to the house its contents and its surroundings by simply adding to the picture. While this is going on Anna is getting increasingly more ill with a fever and besides that is getting totally obsessed with the house and her drawing. On top of that she and her mother are also dealing with her absent father he has a job that takes him away for long stretches though one gets the impression there's actually more to the story than that.OK so the drawing stuff sounds nice enough but frankly there's something really menacing about it. The dreamworld is eerily surreal  the house for instance is just a grey block in the middle of a desolate field. The folks who made the movie did a great job of making us very uncomfortable with this alternate worldongoing dream...One of the things Anna adds to the house is a boy Mark who seems to be the same patient her doctor keeps talking about I'm not giving that away you know from the moment he appears that it's the same kid. In reality Mark can't walk due to an illness in Anna's drawingworld he can't walk because she didn't draw him any legs. She blames herself for his reallife illness and tries to rectify the situation but... everything starts getting really weird. She even brings her absent father into the drawing with disastrous results. The bits with the father are really terrifying.I don't want to give anything away so I'll stop there... There seems to be a lot going on in this film. I'm sure you'll have a ball analyzing this thing do death with your pals after you watch it Is it a simple a story as it seems or are there actually layers of meaning? I don't know but either way it's quite fascinating. There was a Nightmare On Elm Streetish quality about it in that at a certain point reality and dreams intersect. I love things like that.My only complaint is that it feels like it COULD have ended many times but didn't. I'm satisfied with the ending it had some of you sensitive types might want to have Kleenex handy! though it really could have a variety of conclusions. Anyway it doesn't exactly feel drawn out once it's actually over but while you're watching and it keeps fading back in it's a little nerve wracking.Still Paperhouse is a really GOOD film. It's well done and acting especially Charlotte Burke as Anna is top notch. Burke who has never before or since appeared in a film is a real gem. I don't know why she never went onto do anything else but either way she's really convincing and enjoyable to watch.Paperhouse isn't exactly a horror movie it's sort of a fantasysuspensesomething else type of movie with some definite horroresque moments but you can still watch it with your family and not be worried that your little brother or grandmother will get grossed out by blood splashing or something.Give it a chance you won't regret it! And maybe you should read the book too...".

	schema:reviewBody "Anna Charlotte Burke develops a strange fever that causes her to pass out and drift off into a world of her own creation.  A bleak world she drew with a sad little boy as the inhabitant of an old dumpy house in the middle of a lonely field.  Lacking in detail much like any child drawing the house and it's inhabitant Marc who can't walk because Anna didn't draw him any legs are inhabitants of this purgatorylimbo world.  Anna begins visiting the boy and the house more frequently trying to figure what's what and in the process tries to help save the boy but her fever is making it harder for her to wake up each time and may not only kill her but trap her and Marc there forever.Wow!  Is a good word to sum up Bernard Rose's brilliantly haunting and poetic Paperhouse.  A film that is so simple that it's damn near impossible to explain and impossible to forget.  While you may find this puppy in your horror section it's anything but.  It's more of a serious fantasy expertly directed and exceptionally well acted by it's cast in particular Charlotte Burke and Elliot Speirs Marc.  And yet it's not a children's movie either but meant to make us remember those carefree days of old that are now just dark memories.  Rose creates a rich tapestry of moody ambiance that creates a thrilling backdrop for the brilliant story and great actors to play with. Paperhouse stays away from trying to explain it's more dreamy qualities and leaves most things to the viewers imagination.  There's much symbolism and ambiguity here to sink your teeth into.  Paperhouse enjoys playing games with the viewers mind engrossing you with it's very own sense of reasoning. As the story unfolded I was again and again impressed at just how powerful the film managed to be up to the finale which left me with a smile on my face and a tear in my eye.Bernard Rose's visuals are brilliant here.  He's able to create an unnervingly bleak atmosphere that appears simple on the surface but as a whole is much greater than the sum of it's parts.  The acting is of young Charlotte Burke in this her feature debut is a truly impressing as well. Unfortunately she's not graced the screen since.  A much deserved Burnout Central award only seems proper for that performance. Toward the end the movie lags a bit here and there but I was easily able to overlook it.  I wished they had took a darker turn creating a far more powerful finale that would have proved to be all the more unnerving and truly riveting in retrospect.  The movie as is is still one for the books and deserves to be seen by any serious film lover.  It's a poetic ride told through the innocent eyes of a child a powerful film in which much is left to be pondered and far more to be praised.".

This is very apparent with the astonishing Paperhouse a film that touches me deeply each and every time I watch it.The idea of a girl manipulating a dream world with her drawings thusly the dream world manipulating reality and also connecting with and affecting the life of a boy she's never actually met is fascinating and never disappoints.  Charlotte Burke at first seems quite precocious and yet you warm up to her because by being a bit of a mischievous child it makes it hard for the adults to believe what she is experiencing.  She becomes very self aware and strong towards the end even finding she doesn't hate boys as she so defiantly claimed at first.  Through this we are treated to many touching moments and some immensely scary ones all visually stunning with a grand score from Hans Zimmer.  I'm quite proud to be an owner of the soundtrack on CD when it was released in the United States on RCA Victor. At the time of this writing there is no DVD of Paperhouse yet available in the U.S. only in Europe here's hoping one of my wishes will come true as I truly cherish this beautiful film and a DVD of it would be very welcome!It's satisfying watching the girl work out her thoughts like a puzzle game trying to make the dream world work for her and her newfound friend Marc Elliot Spiers.  Both Charlotte Burke and Elliot Spiers do a magnificent job throughout I find the editorial comment on Amazon.com about it being hammy acting quite perplexing  I found every aspect of Paperhouse to be exhilarating.  Even in minor scenes of brilliance like when Charlotte and the girl in the classroom are staring at each other through the glass on a door it's quite powerful.You don't have to be an arthouse type to enjoy Paperhouse just be a person that enjoys a film that stimulates and has you wanting more. There is enough in this film to invite repeated viewings and I'm still in awe of the cinematography and sets.  For me it's never like watching the same film twice as there are so many details to absorb and savor. A very emotional experience indeed.While there are many films I adore there are only a few specific ones that strike a great emotional chord in me films like Paperhouse Static Resurrection and Donnie Darko.  When I see so much drek out there passing as films that will easily be forgotten and in bargain bins all I have to do is watch Paperhouse and my faith in wondrous storytelling is renewed.".

The main thing is the alternate worlds concept which is brought on by Ana's impending illness and the way she manages to link with someone else after being so alone and finally with her family which I believe is still at least a little troubled. It only can be called a horror movie in that it has frightening scenes but is a fantasy with a little hint of coming of age only because Ana is a preteen who hates boys.

That should confirm I was desperate! Long after I had stopped searching I found out about Paperhouse .Paperhouse is based on a favourite book that I own called Marianne Dreams. Paperhouse had also come up in some of the books I had found on horror films but they didn't tell me about the link between book and film. I discovered the truth while on the Internet I bought the film later that day.I thought Paperhouse would not be faithful to the book and dull. Unfaithal it certainly was but dull certainly not. It was the answer to my prayers Marianne is renamed Anna in the film but most of the original story is the same. One day in school Anna draws a house in her scrap book nothing remarkable about that then she becomes ill and every time she faints or falls asleep she finds herself outside a creepy old house and I mean genuinely unnerving. More she also finds that every time she puts something new in the drawing it appears in the dreamworld EG an apple tree. Anna draws into the dreamworld a rather sad boy named mark who apparently is a person in the real world. Mark is a cripple but wants to leave the house obligingly Anna draws in a lighthouse a place to go to but still the problem remains mark can't walk. So Anna decides to draw her father in. she gets her pencil out and gets too work but the outcome is deformed and unsettling Anna particularly dislikes his eyes. Quote he looks like madman. So Anna tries to rub him out and start again but the pencil proves indelible that means nothing can be rubbed out. Then Anna loses her temper and crosses out her father's eyes! I leave you too find out for you self the terrible consequences of the rash action.Paperhouse truly is the British answer to A Nightmare on elm Street! The viewing of this film left me shocked and upset. But I have found what I was looking for after 2 years. The question is how dose the compare with Psycho? Answer 1 the old dark house 2 psychological parental fears 3 a genuine shock 4 and very scary music.".

	schema:reviewBody "While suffering from glandular fever at home and confined to her bedroom 11 year old birthday girl Anna Madden draws a house in her sketch pad. Bizarrely the house comes to be real in her dreams when she falls asleep. So upon waking she starts to draw other things to go with the house including a boy at the window Marc. However things start to turn bad when another character she draws enters the Paperhouse.Four years earlier than Paperhouse we had seen A Nightmare On Elm Street open up a can of worms for the horror movie dream aspect. By the time of Paperhouse's release the format was already looking tired as two sequels to Freddie's jolly had been and gone and a wave of imitators had blighted our screens anyone remember the awful Dream Demon for instance?. This may go some way to explaining why Paperhouse a brilliant and hauntingly poetic movie upped and vanished from the radar. Its director is Bernard Rose who four years later would direct Candyman and put him in the shop window of the horror faithful. Thus prompting many to seek out some of his earlier work and getting Paperhouse talked about again. Not everyone took to it for it's not overtly horror in name. It contains genuine moments of terror but its themes and atmosphere are more in keeping with something like Pan's Labyrinth than with Candyman Candyman Candyman.Paperhouse is open to interpretation by the individual viewer it toys with ideas such as what is the reality here? Is Anna in limbo is it coincidence that she is sick? There's a number of issues that on the surface are not obviously addressed but they can be if you open up to it and use a thought process. Don't get me wrong this is not a complex movie it's thoughtful even cheekily daring but it's not a cranial head scratcher that doesn't make sense. In fact rightfully so the wonderful breath holding ending ties up any loose ends but this again is if you have invested fully in the movie. There's psychological aspects to it as well Anna is about to enter puberty a notoriously difficult time not just for the child but for the parents too most notably the father of girls. This appears in my line of thinking to be very much at the heart of Paperhouse. Certainly the fatherdaughter axis is the crux of the piece but metaphors and some scenes beg for analysis. In tone it's easy to draw a line to two other undervalued horror movies from the 1980s The Lady In White and The Company Of Wolves so fans of those films should definitely check this out. What you or I make of Paperhouse is what makes the movie so special answers to questions are not given just hints. It's fine writing from Matthew Jacobs who adapts from Catherine Storr's novel Marrianne Dreams.The film also looks terrific thanks to production designer Gemma Jackson. The twostory house and its isolated grassy surrounds are suitably creepy but as Anna starts to add things to her drawing this in turn lets Jackson work her magic. The contents of the house range from the eerie icecream makerradio to the poetic a room full of lighted candles while a blue bicycle is almost abstract in its intricacy. Involved on the acting front is only a small cast that features Charlotte Burke as Anna Glenne Headly as her Mother Ben Cross as the father Elliott Spiers as Marc and Gemma Jones playing Dr. Sarah Nicols. This was the only film Burke ever made which is sad because she's fabulous. Starting out bratish and borderline annoying the character quickly pulls us on side as her confusion gives way to a grasp of the situation that in turn makes her resourceful and brave thus fully involving the audience. That's testament to Burke's performance and marks it down as one of the better turns from a British child actor.More fantasy than horror but definitely evocative and haunting. A real smart little movie begging to be seen more now in these post Pan's Labyrinth days. 910".

By the time of Paperhouse's release the format was already looking tired as two sequels to Freddie's jolly had been and gone and a wave of imitators had blighted our screens anyone remember the awful Dream Demon for instance?. This may go some way to explaining why Paperhouse a brilliant and hauntingly poetic movie upped and vanished from the radar. Its director is Bernard Rose who four years later would direct Candyman and put him in the shop window of the horror faithful. Thus prompting many to seek out some of his earlier work and getting Paperhouse talked about again. Not everyone took to it for it's not overtly horror in name. It contains genuine moments of terror but its themes and atmosphere are more in keeping with something like Pan's Labyrinth than with Candyman Candyman Candyman.Paperhouse is open to interpretation by the individual viewer it toys with ideas such as what is the reality here? Is Anna in limbo is it coincidence that she is sick? There's a number of issues that on the surface are not obviously addressed but they can be if you open up to it and use a thought process. Don't get me wrong this is not a complex movie it's thoughtful even cheekily daring but it's not a cranial head scratcher that doesn't make sense. In fact rightfully so the wonderful breath holding ending ties up any loose ends but this again is if you have invested fully in the movie. There's psychological aspects to it as well Anna is about to enter puberty a notoriously difficult time not just for the child but for the parents too most notably the father of girls. This appears in my line of thinking to be very much at the heart of Paperhouse. Certainly the fatherdaughter axis is the crux of the piece but metaphors and some scenes beg for analysis. In tone it's easy to draw a line to two other undervalued horror movies from the 1980s The Lady In White and The Company Of Wolves so fans of those films should definitely check this out. What you or I make of Paperhouse is what makes the movie so special answers to questions are not given just hints. It's fine writing from Matthew Jacobs who adapts from Catherine Storr's novel Marrianne Dreams.The film also looks terrific thanks to production designer Gemma Jackson. The twostory house and its isolated grassy surrounds are suitably creepy but as Anna starts to add things to her drawing this in turn lets Jackson work her magic. The contents of the house range from the eerie icecream makerradio to the poetic a room full of lighted candles while a blue bicycle is almost abstract in its intricacy. Involved on the acting front is only a small cast that features Charlotte Burke as Anna Glenne Headly as her Mother Ben Cross as the father Elliott Spiers as Marc and Gemma Jones playing Dr. Sarah Nicols. This was the only film Burke ever made which is sad because she's fabulous. Starting out bratish and borderline annoying the character quickly pulls us on side as her confusion gives way to a grasp of the situation that in turn makes her resourceful and brave thus fully involving the audience. That's testament to Burke's performance and marks it down as one of the better turns from a British child actor.More fantasy than horror but definitely evocative and haunting. A real smart little movie begging to be seen more now in these post Pan's Labyrinth days. 910";

It's such a pity that she hasn't done anything else as she was an excellent actress altogether. Her portrayal of emotion throughout the film was perfect with just the right amount of subtlety to get the message across especially at the end when she realised that although Marc had died she knew he was going to be alright.Several scenes did make me jump which is a rarity for me in modern horror films most notably the scene in the bathtub the scene where Anna's father was chasing her with the weird radio in the background and the bit where the legs broke apart and crumbled to dust.All in all an excellent and very moving film.".

Esposito takes his time to introduce the characters tell the story being almost contemplative and seeks redemption for its conclusion. That's not necessarily a bad thing actually it's refreshing. However his characters are poorly written the script is too simplistic and although Danny Glover and Tom Bower which slightly resembles Peter Boyle's character in Monster's Ball have good moments the ensemble acting is underwhelming Angela Bassett usually a great actress has had better times and Esposito a great actor himself shows that directing yourself doesn't always work. Listening to him speak about this project leaves no doubt that he had good intentions and a passion for it. Nonetheless I couldn't help but feeling like I was watching a run of the mill TV movie made thousands of times before.

When you consider the short period of time taken to shoot this film19 daysit becomes that much more of a wonder. Being that this is Giancarlo's first project as Director I greatly look forward to his next.

Well made and well acted tale wants to hit one out of the box in examinations of race and community but is mired with a script that never completely shakes off its well worn cloak. We've been here before and while much of the film works it still relies on clich there is something about Julia Stiles character that just doesn't ring true. I think perhaps the film is trying to do too much there are a good number of characters and all are given a certain amount of time. I liked it but I didn't love it. Of course the DVD cover made it look like a thriller or mystery which while it has elements isn't what it really is.".

What was wrong with this movie?On viewing it is a quiet solid and undramatic movie. Many could describe it as boring it runs more akin to a decent rather worthy TV movie touching on issues involving a small town community in the Deep South. The issues are quietly relevant and handled suitably. The acting by all concerned is sterling but none excel and none take their roles above those of ordinary people which is probably a good thing but that could be why it might be seen as lacklustre and underwhelming. I thought that Julia Styles who I've not always enjoyed as the young schoolteacher particularly poignant and believable.Apparently it was shot in just 19 days on a shoestring budget by debut director Giancarlo Esposito. The laidback bluesy soundtrack was both fitting and enjoyable.I agree with the other reviewer about the ending. It may have been a movie that had complex topics that couldn't be resolved but this was just shutoff. Like a novel that had its last chapter missing. This is probably why I'm only awarding 610 instead 710.Why it seems to be only available as a region 1 effectively barring UK  European buyers is a puzzle. It certainly won't be in anyone's top 10 or necessarily remembered even but its cast list and the fact that it's OK bordering on good makes it even more curious. Having said that I wouldn't be one who'd buy the DVD most probably.".

Can the many characters of this drama find redemption in racial reconciliation or will it ignore its history for the price of a few jobs from a rapacious developer?This fascinating drama which works harder than any recent movie I have seen at capturing the rhythms of the currentday smalltown South deserved a bigger audience than it is getting on DVD and cable. However the movie does not entirely succeed simply because it is trying to depict a fairly complicated community in two hours and to get its mission done it reaches far too often for handy clichs. You know the ones  outside corporations are by definition superevil every white man is at least a little bit racist and there is a rich cabal outside the main action of the drama who really control everything. The most successful dramas in recent years dealing with smaller communities Twin Peaks Friday Night Lights have been TV shows which have more time to develop characters and a sense of community. This movie which has too many major characters to develop has the right idea in its pacing and its allowance in all but one of its main characters some shades of gray. But it can't quite get to a believable conclusion of redemption because the movie running time was not there. Considering the elephantitis of so many content free films these days it is a shame the movie makers did not have the budget or the runtime to put more meat on its fascinating subplots.This guy needs another chance at his subject. Because he understands the South and the way that southern towns are so often haunted by their past. Hopefully he'll get a miniseries on cable to demonstrate it.".

That is called the love of money which is the root of all evil. Instead of fighting to save Gospel Hill Dr. Ron Palmer Giancarlo Esposito joins the developers making money by taking advantage of the less fortunate and calling it opportunity.

He lost his passion to fight for what's right years ago when his father Paul was gunned down and left to bleed to death in the street. The 40th anniversary of his father's death is approaching but he's not sure he can bring himself to attend the ceremony to honor Paul Malcolm's legacy. John has to work through the pain he's been feeling for so long. Will he do it in time to save his wife whose life is in danger? This movie goes from present to past. The past focuses on Paul Malcolm Samuel L. Jackson an activist for social justice and it's filmed in black  white  nice effect. There wasn't as much intensity as I expected for a movie dealing with racial issues and that was fine because although I was a bit bothered by some of the content I wasn't left feeling angry. Not a whole lot of profanity. Sex scenes weren't graphic. Love Angela Bassett and the strong woman she portrayed. Church scene was touching.

After the Berlin Wall falls he moves to the U.S. to try to sell his invention. Most of the movie consists of painfully obvious fish out of watertype jokes.

	schema:headline " Waste of a good ideacameos and more";
	schema:reviewBody "Where to start first the movie was filmed around the fall of the Berlin wall a bit of intentional dating of a time period and actually filmed in Germany so the filmmakers get a few plus points for that. Technically it is about the fall of the inner German barrier between east and west Germany and a wacky inventor who wants to cross it and doesn't due to the fact that by the time he is done with his invention to cross it the wall is torn down.And that is the waste of a good idea a great movie could have been made about a man trying to cross the barrier and not suceeding until Oct 1991 when the barrier was opened. Instead what we get is a version of the fish out of water scenario with wasted cameos wasted talent and shoddy writing.First off I had this movie as a kid the supermarket had it for sale from their previewed video aisle all copies I have seen on the market have been previewed from rental stores I doubt this movie saw a wide retail release or even a wide theatrical release. Just to write a review I tracked down another copy on VHS and watched it and it was just like I remembered it except my tastes had changed and i found it to be rather dreary and a chore to sit through with occasional laughs from the cameos that are very much wasted.Where to start with describing the actual film what was put out on VHS back in 1992. it starts out with some classical music and scenes of the town that reflects the change from communist names to non communist names it isn't important to the film just a cheap joke. After the credits you get a voice over describing the inventor and some of his silly inventions. His final invention after 5 or so years of experimentation is a Trabant that is capable of high speeds and is powered by reuben turnup and the wall gets torn down before he gets to use it. later an American investor comes to town to become wasted cameo 1 George Kennedy gets a few scenes where he plays a generic American businessman. For that actor it is not really that much work it was an easy paycheck and a trip to Germany. After two scenes which for this film warrants a box cover photo to make it seem like you are in the entire movie the inventor enters into an agreement to help save his town by sending his car to America for an auto show where wasted cameo 2 gets started Milton Berle playing a hotel clerk who isn't flummoxed by any earthquakes. He also meets one part of wasted talent Billy Dee Williams who is underused in this movie as a valet parker who was also a car thief at one time who helps our inventor after the car is stolen. The entire movie then starts to become a traditional fish out of water story the car gets found at wasted talent 3's house played by Dom DeLuise doing a mafia impression. Along the way we see Richard Moll James Toklian among other actors in roles that are more or less cameos. The movie resolves after they steal the car back and find an invenstor to save the town.Now that the plot is out of the way time to get down to the crux of the problem. The movie is full of bait and switch moments the movie baits you with a story about a wacky inventor like the absent minded professor but switches to a political commentary and fish out of water story that is not pulled off well at all. Half the jokes are in east Germany this and that. It is not funny the jokes get stale after the first 20 minutes as they are all retreads of the same joke. The guy has never been in a normal supermarket show him amazed at that. The guy has never been in a huge city show him amazed at that rinse and repeat that joke. That is how most of the humor in this movie works. This film could have aired on a weekend TV movie show in the 90s like the NBC Sunday night movie not a theatrical release.In conclusion avoid this movie unless you are a fan of cheesy comedies from the 90s that are boring and clichie beyond belief".

	schema:headline " Pleasant enough but nowhere near as great as i remember it being when i was a kid";
	schema:reviewBody "This was a movie that I used to get a kick out of checking out of the video store when I was a kid because I remember finding it so very very oddball. Its about an East German scientist that invents a car that can run on vegetables and can run up to 200 miles per hour doing so! He comes to L.A. to try and sell the invention to a businessman and try and make some money to save his hometown which is about to be bought out by a rich industrialist and turned into a factory town or something like that. Almost as soon as he comes to L.A. the car gets stolen by none other than the mean detention giving vice principal from the Back To The Future films. the rest of the movie is mostly made up of his and Billy Dee's attempts to get the car back Rewatching it again tonight for the first time in what had to be like at least 17 or 18 years I bought the VHS of this from a CVS pharmacy sometime in either 97 or 98 from what I remember and hadn't played it since and was eager to see it again with a friend of mine who wanted me to try and find some of the more obscure movies in my VHS collectionwhy? because obscure movies are awesome! I realized that the movie wasn't nearly as oddball or as inventive as I had originally thought. Its basically kind of a German take on Young Einstein where a wacky outsider stumbles or invents something astounding and then spends the movie trying to get the other people around him to comprehend the value of his invention. and along the way he finds love and friendship and some hearty adventure as wellSeeing as how I very much loved Young Einstein when I was a kid its not that big a leap to see why I liked this one as well since the two movies seem to have quite a bit in common humor wise at least in the first 20 minutes before the scientist comes to America.It was interesting watching it again I honestly quite enjoyed the set up of the film in the small East German town and I enjoyed seeing Dom Deluise looking like he was having fun hamming it up in his villainous role when he turns up which he doesn't until the last half of the movie. Meanwhile Billy Dee Williams while commanding a screen presence as always does not appear to be enjoying himself as much but i'm not sure if that's him or if that's the role he was playingwhich was more of a straight man to the wacky German. There was one scene tho where he takes over as auctioneer at the auction that has people bidding on the vegetable carand he's trying to describe how fast the car can runand well its hard sometimes to not wanna make a Star Wars reference when it would seem to really fit the scene.Anyways I was surprised that the movie wasn't nearly as much fun as I thought it was when I was 10 or 11 but there were moments where I was really happy to be seeing it again for the first time in a long time. Moments such as the random Super Mario Bros. 3 references or the Bart Simpson TShirt the German sports in an effort to look more American..or of course his attempt at a street name M.C. Schmidt rolls eyes No if you can allow yourself to enjoy silliness you might enjoy it but its also no Collision Course if oddball humor that happens while cultures clashing is what you seek. Collision Courseaka Pat Morita and Jay Leno's version of Rush Hour from the mid 80's I'd also like to say for the record that the friend I watched the movie with tonight kept asking throughout the entire movie why the scientist doesn't just try to rebuild the car himself rather than chase all around L.A trying to get it back. The ending while I won't spoil it here basically came down to that very question ironically enough meaning my friend even while more than half asleep was able to accurately predict what was the one thing in the movie that needed to be answered before the movie could successfully end. I gotta give him credit here he was dozing off pretty soundly in the last half hour but he got the main flaw of the movie right off the bat without missing a beat! Also what the heck was Milton Berle doing in this movie? Did he owe someone a favor or something? His part is so thankless toohe plays a hotel manager who refuses to budge from his spot at the front desk while an earthquake is going on. That's the former king of TV MR. TV himself in this movie and what is he even doing here?!?!?!?".

	schema:reviewBody "This great world is full of mysteries One of the biggest of all however is why the hell some horror movie buffs  myself included  are still showing respect  admiration for Jess Franco even though he brought us nearly nothing but boring crap and senseless exploitation. Take this rubbish for example! White Cannibal Queen is a hopelessly incompetent and agonizing excuse for a motion picture and Franco clearly just made it to quickly cash in on the huge success his fellow Eurocult directors were having with movies like Cannibal Holocaust Mountain of the Cannibal God and Jungle Holocaust. But those were captivating and eventful films whereas Franco's movie is extremely dull and stupid from start to finish. Dull because there's almost no storyline and not even a remotely interesting character drawing and stupid because the sequences involving cannibalism andor savage tribes are hilarious instead of grueling! The supposedly relentless cannibals hop around with painted faces that make them look like clowns and most of them don't even look like South American natives. They're white! Franco's cannibals are the least menacing ones I've ever seen and the lack of budget  inspiration even prevents them from eating many people. Whenever the cannibals attack someone the screen swifts into a slowmotion compilation of dark and blurry images and it's nearly impossible to make out what's happening. It looks as if the same pieces of flesh are repeatedly ripped from a female's stomach and this goes on for entire minutes! The plot is a giant ripoff as well as you've seen it all before  and better. An adventurous young couple and their 8yearold daughter travel down the Amazonian river when they get attacked by a tribe of funnily facepainted savages. The wife gets eaten and the young girl abducted but the father Fulci regular Al Cliver manages to escape with only the loss of one arm. Years of intense psychiatric help later he mobilizes an expedition team and reenters the jungle to rescue his daughter. The girl turned into an incredible hot teenager and  to get things even more complicated  she's considered a sacred goddess by the cannibal tribe so it won't be easy to get her out of the jungle. Does she even want to get out? White Cannibal Queen is slowpaced dull and poorly made. The acting performances are lousy and the use of music is often completely inappropriate. There's too little gore and sleaze so even the most tolerant Franco fans are likely to consider this as one of his lousiest accomplishments. Avoid White Cannibal Queen at all costs and rewatch Cannibal Holocaust for the umpteenth time.".

It looks as if the same pieces of flesh are repeatedly ripped from a female's stomach and this goes on for entire minutes! The plot is a giant ripoff as well as you've seen it all before  and better. An adventurous young couple and their 8yearold daughter travel down the Amazonian river when they get attacked by a tribe of funnily facepainted savages. The wife gets eaten and the young girl abducted but the father Fulci regular Al Cliver manages to escape with only the loss of one arm. Years of intense psychiatric help later he mobilizes an expedition team and reenters the jungle to rescue his daughter. The girl turned into an incredible hot teenager and  to get things even more complicated  she's considered a sacred goddess by the cannibal tribe so it won't be easy to get her out of the jungle. Does she even want to get out? White Cannibal Queen is slowpaced dull and poorly made. The acting performances are lousy and the use of music is often completely inappropriate. There's too little gore and sleaze so even the most tolerant Franco fans are likely to consider this as one of his lousiest accomplishments. Avoid White Cannibal Queen at all costs and rewatch Cannibal Holocaust for the umpteenth time.";

	schema:headline " Beyond Awful Franco Take on the Cannibal Genre";
	schema:reviewBody "Being a great fan of the prolific Spanish Exploitation deity Jess Franco I always believe negative feedback to a Franco flick I haven't seen to be exaggerated. It is undeniable that the man's impressive repertoire of about 200 directed movies includes masterpieces as well as bigtime stinkers and everything inbetween. However I do tend to enjoy even those Franco films that most people find awful. This is not the case with this film however. Mondo Cannibale aka. Barbarian GoddessWhite Cannibal QueenCannibalsMondo Cannibale 3 is Franco's attempt at the Cannibal subgenre which with its gruesome and uncompromising films was very successful in Italy at the time. Right after the abysmal French Terreur Cannibale in which Franco was also involved Mondo Cannibale is the secondtoworst Cannibal film I have ever seen and it has replaced Sadomania in its rank as the worst Francoflick I've seen. Mondo Cannibale is by the way not to be confused with Umberto Lenzi's Il Paese Del Sesso Selvaggio 1972 and Ruggero Deodato's Ultimo Mondo Cannibale 1979 two classic Italian Cannibal films which are titled Mondo Cannibale III in many countries. This abysmal Franco flick is therefore often referred to as Mondo Cannibale 3.For whatever reason a scientist Al Cliver brings his wife and young daughter with him on an expedition deep in a jungle filled with hungry cannibals. His wife gets eaten and he escapes without his daughter ! after his hand has been chopped off. Years later the scientist comes back for his daughter along with a couple of bored rich people who don't believe in his story and are just there to have fun. The cannibals are in the meanwhile worshiping the daughter who has blossomed into a beautiful barebosomed blondeas a 'white goddess'...There is so much wrong with this film that I hardly know where to begin The jungle is not a jungle. It is a very neat assembly of palmtrees probably somewhere in Spain or Southern France. It is so neat that the expedition is capable of going there in cars. Sometimes one can even see Western buildings in the background. The 'savages'are entirely white guys. Some of them sport mustaches sideburns and hip haircuts. Other wear watches or gold rings. Even though they clearly hate 'whites' which is odd since they are white themselves the cannibals declare the white girl their goddess on sight. The child by the way has brown hair which magically becomes blond when she grows up. The main hero is apparently cowardly enough to leave his child daughter behind with a bunch of cannibals but insanely brave enough to go back there after years with two other men and three women to face the entire cannibal tribe... I could go on and on about the film's inconsistencies however the incredible logical errors are actually the most fun factor of the film. Sadly all the rest is very boring. The seemingly neverending monotonous drum banging is annoying as hell.The Cannibal genre has many great Italian films to offer for anyone interested. The genre's only true masterpiece is Ruggero Deodato's Cannibal Holocaust 1980 but there are many other gruesome and disturbing ones to watch most notably Deodato's Ultimo Mondo Cannibale and all of Umberto Lenzi's Cannibal films. Jess Frano's take on the genre is a disaster. The budget was obviously tiny but that's hardly an excuse as Franco has proved on many occasions that he is perfectly capable of making great films on a tiny budget. The man has to be saluted for dabbling in about any ExploitationHorror subgenre imaginable. This film is still awful and hard to sit through. Not even Franco's muse and reallife wife Lina Romay can save this. One to be avoided unless you are writing a book on Jess Franco.".

As for little Lana she's also located by the tribe and brought back to the village. Instead of eating her they decide to start worshiping her. Why? I'm not really sure but I'm presuming it's because of the luxurious bleach blonde hair the brownhaired child miraculously manages to sprout later on in the film. Many years after the attack Jeremy finally recovers from a long bout of temporary amnesia with help from his loyal nurse Ana Lina Romay and decides to organize a safari into the jungle to try to locate his nowgrown daughter Sabrina Siani. They along with wealthy skeptic Charles Fenton Olivier Mathot pampered Barbara Shelton Shirley Knight and half a dozen other nondescript men and women then venture into the jungle and end up getting picked off one by one. Though most of the cast are done away with by poison arrow or spear there are three cannibalism scenes  all of them involving topless women and all of them going on for what seems like an eternity... in slow motion... with the same shots of cannibals pulling out and chewing on organs accompanied by moans and slurping noises being repeated over and over again...Trying to come up with a list of all the areas where this fails would far exceed the word limit allowed here but where it's most inadequate is in the believability department. Some of the best cannibal movies work because they were actually filmed in tropical locales and managed to establish a sense of complete isolation far removed from civilized man. Here the jungle looks like some kind of country club where the native vegetation and surroundings are just all wrong. It's hard to believe a cannibal tribe could thrive when there are modern houses with paved sidewalks a hop skip and a jump away. During one hilarious scene a couple of cannibals are even seen running down what appears to be a paved road! Speaking of the cannibals they aren't the least bit believable either. Most are whiteEuropean and Spanish actors that have their faces painted in unnaturally bright blue red and yellow clown colors. The shyer members of the tribe have also somehow managed to acquire some bikini briefs to wear under their loincloths. Siani gets her own specially made thong loincloth though. I guess they felt she was special since she's just one of two women shown to be in the tribe. As far as cannibal movies go this one sits at the very bottom of the list next to DEVIL HUNTER 1980 another Franco bomb and CANNIBAL TERROR 1981. All three came from a hack production company called Eurocin who were also responsible for two of the worst zombie movies ever made OASIS OF THE ZOMBIES 1981 again by Franco... see a pattern here? and ZOMBIE LAKE 1980.".

As soon as a character speaks we are relegated to the production levels of a porn flick although there is no sex on display here rare for a Franco film. Equally guaranteed to break any intended atmospherics the jazzy Daniel White music is typically inappropriate other credited composers are Roberto Pregadio and Franco himself.Years later after being nursed back to semihealth by Lina Romay as Candy Coaster as Ana the nurse Taylor vows to return to the 'jungle' which looks like a palm tree park and is shown to be located on the edge of bustling civilisation with a group of people led by a rich couple who don't believe his story anyway and think the whole thing will be a bit of fun. As luck would have it by this time his daughter is now a beautiful blowdried blonde 17 yearold Sabrina Siani described somewhat uncharitably by Franco as the worst actress he had ever worked with. She is still the white goddess to the cannibals however most of which are moustachioed Caucasians with curiously hip haircuts. Death to the white invaders yells the cannibal chief at one point presumably not noticing the majority of his tribe are white themselves.Franco's disinterest in the cannibal genre is something he has never been shy about and it is possible these films were foisted upon him by producers at Eurocin. As such much like his 'Oasis of the Zombies' a couple of years later this is a perfunctory work  quite enjoyable and not without merit but containing little that is compelling. The best thing is the acting from RomayCoaster and Al Cliver whose performance is head and shoulders above anything else here.Lana as a child is played by 'Anouska' who also played the little girl Helena in the film Franco deserted 'Zombie Lake 1981' subsequently directed by Jean Rollin.This project is also known as 'Die Blonde Gottin The Blonde Goddess' 'White Cannibal Queen' 'A Woman for the Cannibals' and 'Barbarian Goddess'.".

And if you must know White Cannibal Queen is not even the worst of the Jongle Gore epics. I mean I'm pretty sure it was got for quite a while but in case you didn't know in 2003 Bruno Mattei would finally work up the nerve to try his hand at this and the shotonvideo travesty called Cannibal Holocaust 2 The Beginning was born. And considering Mattei was Italian well that's just ridiculous! Just sayin'. Either way if you didn't absolutely despise Cannibal Terror then maybe you won't consider White Cannibal Queen as repulsive as most do. Me? I liked it! This movie is about a family who are out on the Amazon river are attacked by savages. The young daughter kidnapped. The wife eaten. years later Dr. Taylor returns to this jungle in hopes of finding his nowgrown daughter. Unfortunately things don't go quite as expected. But then again when do things ever go smoothly when Cannibals are involved? But these guys shouldn't put up too much of a fight being that they're the most fakelooking cannibals in Jungle Gore history. This is just sad. Some of them are even white! Just a pathetic movie in general. However considering Lina Romay  a rather groovy score White Cannibal Queen is OK in my book! Yet if you got any schlockpride at all you'll just go for something of quality like Cannibal Ferox and call it a day. 610".

She has turned into a vacanteyed hottie with perfect blonde hair and a cute butt. Slowly she remembers who he is and they head back to civilization together after the doctor has won a onearmed fight with the daughter's cannibal husband.MONDO CANNIBALE aka CANNIBALS looks like it was shot in someone's backyard has some of the worst English dubbing I've ever heard and gore effects that consist of little more than hunks of meat soaked in fake blood being gnawed on by extras. The cannibals themselves look ridiculous in their loincloths and greasepaint and the score can best be described as disco tribal music.Despite all this however the movie did hold my attention if only to see just how awful it could get. Being directed by Jess Franco there's an atmosphere of seediness to temper the technical ineptitude. I certainly didn't get tired of seeing the daughter cavorting around in nothing but a leather gstring and there are plenty of unintentional laughs along the way as well.Blue Underground's DVD presents the movie remastered and looking far better than it has any right to. There's also a funny charming interview with Franco in which he reveals he's well aware of how terrible the movie is and his distaste for the cannibal subgenre in general.Recommended for cannibal movie completists only.".

	schema:reviewBody "OK not the most brilliant film but very gory compared to other cannibal movies. The slow motion eating scenes were good to watch as it slows down the horror to a point where you are nearly sick and totally horrified as they eat the guts of their unfortunate victims. A little boring in parts but the gut munching makes up for that easily. With the exception of cannibal Holocaust this is one of the gruesome cannibal horrors around. However though it is one of the cheesiest ones too as most of the cannibals look like English actors and the lines are very cheesy too especially when the chief of the tribe is talking. I couldn't help but laugh and of course the stupid characters who ignore the warnings and end up running right into the cannibals clutches which you obviously know is going to happen but you wait to see who gets it first. It is a bit cruel also in parts especially when the women get eaten a few of which you don't want to die but they do with horrific consequences.If you just fancy a good gore fest then sit down with a rare steak and beer and watch cannibals. if you can take it.".

	onyx:emotionText "OK not the most brilliant film but very gory compared to other cannibal movies. The slow motion eating scenes were good to watch as it slows down the horror to a point where you are nearly sick and totally horrified as they eat the guts of their unfortunate victims. A little boring in parts but the gut munching makes up for that easily. With the exception of cannibal Holocaust this is one of the gruesome cannibal horrors around. However though it is one of the cheesiest ones too as most of the cannibals look like English actors and the lines are very cheesy too especially when the chief of the tribe is talking.

	schema:reviewBody "Jess Franco fans like myself are kind of like drug addicts always watching another film hoping against hope to again capture the initial rush of something like Succubus Venus in Furs or EugenieStory of her Journey into Perversion. Usually we just wind up with mediocre dreck that leaves us vaguely dissatisfied. Sometimes though we REALLY get burned like with this film. To be fair jungle action films are not Franco's fortehis films often fail to maintain a basic suspension of disbelief that they were NOT filmed in European zoo. Cannibalism is not Franco's thing either for instance he doesn't seem to realize that even cannibals COOK their food before they eat it. Franco actually used the same long slowmotion takes of people eating raw flesh in extreme closeups at the climax of one of his WIP movies but in that context it was pretty sickening if that's a plus. Here though it's just tedious and dullthe only way this rates a 99 on the vomit meter as Joe Bob Briggs supposedly said is if extreme boredom causes you to somehow throw up.Naturally with cannibal scenes this laughable the film is nowhere near as potent as one of your better Italian cannibal epics although they don't slaughter any real animals at least. But one thing I certainly would expect from a Franco film is sex and nudityand that's were it REALLY disappoints. Lina Mrs. Jess Franco Romay is in the cast but Franco uncharacteristically keeps her under wraps except for a brief tshot when she's being eaten literally. She is by far the most talented actor in the movie but still what a waste of an actress who had one of the best bodies around in those days. You have the opposite problem with Sabrina Siani playing the same barelylegal jungle girl character played by Alice Arno Katja Beinert and Ursula Fellehner in other Franco movies. Siani spends the entire movie halfnaked but she's such a terrible actress even that gets boring and her one sex scene can best be described as somnambulistic. I also couldn't help wondering how the darkhaired little girl in the beginning grew up to be a blonde teenager albeit with dark roots. Where did she find peroxide in the jungle? Of course she had to be blonde or this white goddess wouldn't have looked any whiter than the obviously European cannibals.But I'm forgetting somethingoh yeah the plot. Well it's pretty much the exact same plot as Diamonds of Kilimajaro but with more inept cannibalism scenes and less gratuitous nudity. Watch that one instead.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dr. Jeremy Taylor Al Cliver Jerry to his lady friends! is a specialist in tropical diseases. Together with his wife Elizabeth Pamela Stanford and young daughter Lana Anouchka he is traveling by boat to a remote jungle Hospital to conduct some research. However the captain of the boat warns Jeremy that a previous expedition was attacked killed and eaten by a local tribe of cannibals. Some cannibals sneak on board the boat even though they had to swim across the river to the boat when they board it they are completely dry. The cannibals kill the captain with a spear. They grab Elizabeth and do what cannibals do best they rip her stomach open pull her intestines out and eat them. Jeremy witnesses this the cannibals decide to kidnap Jeremy and take him back to their village. Lana manages to hide from the cannibals and is not seen. Later she is found floating in a river by the tribes leader and his young son immediately she is worshiped as a 'white goddess' and is also taken to the village. Once there the cannibals chop the lower half of Jeremy's left arm off. They cook it over a fire and start to eat it. They are soon distracted by the arrival of their leader and Lana. Jeremy senses his opportunity and makes his escape. He is found and rescued by two men in a jeep. Cut to New York cue lots of shots of the Statue of Liberty and the Manhattan skyline. Jeremy is Hospitalized and considered mad but he does get a sexy nurse Ana Lina Romay to look after him and take him for walks around Manhattan. When Jeremy is released he heads straight for Barbara Shelton Shirley Knight the president of the Shelton organization who funded his original expedition. He tries to obtain funding for another trip so he can find his now grown up daughter Sabrina Siani. Eventually she agrees as long as herself her lover Charles Fenton Olivier Mathot and some of their rich friends who want to come along for an adventure can join him. Jeremy's sexy nurse Ana also tags along. While taking some photos of each other Barbara steps onto a severed hand. Jeremy also find his Hospital which has been attacked and all the staff killed. As the remaining group carry on towards the cannibals village they are picked off onebyone. Directed by Jesus Franco this is a pretty inept film. At least one of the expedition isn't given a name which sums up the depth of character Franco wanted to achieve. The cannibals themselves are laughable they decorate themselves with children's face paint and have dodgy haircuts. The village is depicted by two huts. And why do the females in this film wear high heeled boots? They look good ladies but aren't very practical considering their hiking through the middle of thick jungle. There is also a plastic crocodile at the beginning that looks stupid. Talking of plastic props Franco uses several plastic skulls that maybe he borrowed from Jerry Warren after he had made Frankenstein Island 1981 they don't even have hollow eye sockets. The editing is poor Lana is seen looking through the window of the boat the next time she is seen she is floating in a river thats as clear as mud as to what happened there then. At the end when the main cannibals head is held underwater when he gets up his hair is wet and his face paint is smudged in the next shot after that he is dry and his face paint is perfect. The one thing that could have saved this the gore is also ruined by Franco. He films the cannibal scenes in such a way that they are boring. Unbelievable but true. He uses slow motion jerkiness extreme close ups blurriness the odd shot in black and white that appear to be placed in there at random and on the soundtrack he uses chanting heavy breathing and echoing. It's a shame because the effects aren't to bad lots of animal intestines blood rib cages and fake torn flesh it's just the way Franco presents it. He makes sure there's plenty of naked flesh around too. Sabrina Siani is always at least half naked whenever she appears on screen which isn't a bad thing by any means. Franco has a cameo as a businessman who trades with the cannibals. There are much better cannibal films out there but this is good for a few unintentional laughs. It keeps moving at a fair pace but overall is very poor. Don't waste your time.".

This was a Vestron Video release and it had one of those tiny video descriptions on the back that said something like A family of vacationers are attacked by... CANNIBALS! and below that were two box cover previews of other soontobereleased videos like DEATH SHIP and THE NEVER DEAD aka PHANTASM.When I put this on I discovered that this appeared to be another one of those CANNIBAL FEROXcumTHE WOMAN FROM DEEP RIVERtype movies. It was yet another Italian production with extremely bad dubbing and it stars Al Cliver!! of ZOMBIE fame.A boat captain his wife and their young daughter probably about 8 years old are vacationing in some Amazontype location. They dock in some desolate swamp while enjoying the sights. A band of native men sneak aboard the boat from the water and attack the family. The father is knocked out while the mother is eaten alive! Yes you heard me right. The native cannibals hold the mother down while they tear flesh from her stomach. We spend about five minutes watching the mother moan in agony as she becomes cannibal food. We don't see too much of the actual flesh tearing but we do get to see some awful shots of the cannibals munching on what looks like chunks of cantaloupe covered in ketchup and all the while the camera pans on the mother's face while she whimpers and moans. When they're done with her they kidnap the daughter and disappear.It is now about 20 years later and we cut to the 'present' day and Al Cliver has been hired by the Captain of the boat to help him locate his daughter like the probabilities of her being alive are high!. He believes he has found the exact location of the cannibal tribe deep within the jungle.How could Al Cliver say no? He certainly couldn't resist taking two strangers to Zombie island in ZOMBIE but I digress. So the two men and a group of other local natives not cannibals of the country set out on an expedition to find the daughter. Meanwhile we shoot to shots of the cannibal tribe and the daughter is indeed alive. She is now a voluptuous young beauty with long blonde hair who spends most of her time walking around with her breasts in full shot covered in body markings and tattoos. We even get to see sleazy shots of her having sex with the young man who will become leader of the tribe when it is his time. It appears as though she has adapted to the locale and barely has any recollection of her natural parents. There are no reasons as to why she didn't become cannibal food  I guess she was just a set precedent so we could be introduced further down the line to a naked blonde woman.Meanwhile Al Cliver and his troop are attacked along the way by the cannibals. Of course the native men of his troop are the first to die. We get to see them getting attacked and eaten the same way we got to see the mother die. 5 minutes of slow tedious shots of moaning and whimpering and ridiculous face shots of the cannibals munching on pieces of cantaloupe. I've never seen anything so ridiculous!Cut to the chase the next 30 minutes shows the rescue attempt of the daughter by Cliver the slaying of the young man she was having sex with and a great deal of slaughter of the cannibal tribesmen.I couldn't wait to return this garbage to the video store. And to think this was a 5day rental! Why are all these Italian horror genre movies the same! They all appear as if they were filmed by some grainy tinny little camera they always hire the WORST actorsactresses I've seen Al Cliver in about three of them now and the dubbing is worse than what's usually featured in a Bruce Lee movie the dialogue continues even after their mouths have stopped moving!I give this movie a Grade Z  It rates about the same as THE VIDEO DEAD.".

That's not the case here as the story is pretty bland and there's nothing to really keep you glued to the film. The performances are all rather bland but the attractive cast does feature Cliver Lina Romay Robert Foster and Pamela Stanford. Sabrina Siani plays the grown up daughter and at least walks around nude to keep things moving.

The acting is really bad and I have seen more gore going into a butchers shop when they are preparing their stock. I remember seeing this movie when i was a kid and how i covered my eyes at some scenesbut now when i think about it maybe i covered my eyes because it was so bad. I viewed it today for the first time since the 80s thinking that maybe it would be good as im a big fan of the splatter movies of than genre and was looking for a blood and guts fest. The movie just doesn't deliverthe acting is patheticthe gore is a laughable and if it wasn't for the sexy blonde who walked about topless then i would have turned it off. The movie is about a family who are on a boat and get attacked by cannibalsthe mother gets eaten alive and the daughter gets kidnapped by the cannibals who look like guys who would sell you fake designer labels when you go on holiday. Anyway the father survives and goes back to the USyears later he gets his memory back and goes looking for his daughter with a gang of people you wouldn't depend on if you got lost in a mall. The movie i would recommend to watch if you've had alcohol and want a good laughas thats what i done through it just looking at the goofs. Things to watch out forcannibals that wear wedding ringsplastic skulls of polesthe need to speak English to let you know what role the girl plays in the movie and a Portuguese guy who sounds like George Bush. Anyway i wont spoil this movie for youbut be warned that if you invite your friends to watch it with you then you could loose them.".

The movie is about a family who are on a boat and get attacked by cannibalsthe mother gets eaten alive and the daughter gets kidnapped by the cannibals who look like guys who would sell you fake designer labels when you go on holiday. Anyway the father survives and goes back to the USyears later he gets his memory back and goes looking for his daughter with a gang of people you wouldn't depend on if you got lost in a mall. The movie i would recommend to watch if you've had alcohol and want a good laughas thats what i done through it just looking at the goofs. Things to watch out forcannibals that wear wedding ringsplastic skulls of polesthe need to speak English to let you know what role the girl plays in the movie and a Portuguese guy who sounds like George Bush. Anyway i wont spoil this movie for youbut be warned that if you invite your friends to watch it with you then you could loose them.";

	schema:text "    Sam Dunn is a 30year old anthropologist who wrote his graduate thesis on the plight of Guatemalan refugees. Recenly he has decided to study the plight of a different culture one he has been a part of since he was a 12year old the culture of heavy metal. Sam sets out on a global journey to find out why this music has been consistently stereotyped dismissed and condemned and yet is loved so passionately by its millions of fans. Along the way Sam explores metals' obsession with some of life's most provacative subjects  sexuality religion violence and death  and discovers some things about the culture that even he can't defend. Shot on location in the UK Germany Norway Canada and the US this documentary is the first of its kind. It is both a defense of a longmisunderstood art form and a window for the outsider into the spectacle that is heavy metal.";

Well it is in part but I couldn't stay objective either were I given the chance to sit down with Bruce Dickinson at the Hammersmith Odeon.

Each area is thoughtfully explored with comments from many musicians and some outside observers. From the calm commentary of Rob Zombie to the wry humour of Dio to the laughable minimalist interviews with Norwegian blackmetal players there's a broad range of experiences and opinions.This is an excellent documentary in every way.I knew it was going to be great when I got my first glimpse of the big chart of metal bands that correctly put KISS far away from the actual musicians. Ronnie James Dio further obliged with a running commentary on Gene Simmon's preference for money over music.You'll get to see and hear a lot of great bands from the standard warhorses like Maiden Metallica Motorhead and Slayer to the lessmainstream stuff like Voivod.".

Tony Iommi Dee Snider and Ronnie James Dio all give standout interviews with Dio's digs at Gene Simmons being especially revealing. It was also great to see '80s curiosities Accept and Quebec's own Voivod being represented. The segment contrasting the grunting leatherclad bands such as Man O War with the lacewearing bands such as Poison and Cinderella was unexpected and fascinating. Showing the closeted Rob Halford performing in full cruising gear for a rabid hetero audience was quite poignant. I especially like how the film stresses how the music let its fans dream cope and find solace. Those like myself whose interest in metal may have flagged in the intervening years would do well to view it and remind themselves what all of the fuss was about.".

He knew how and where to delve into the culture with a healthy reverence for his subject matter but with the objectivity to examine in a way that outsiders could glean appreciation. I found it fascinating.In a systematic wellstructured manner heavy metal's origins and history were examined as was the disparity between its followers and detractors. Fans band members and industry experts were interviewed. The questions and answers were intelligent. Historic file footage was used. The culture and its many subgenres was analysed. The relationships between heavy metal and gender sex religion Satanism and violence were all covered in a most interesting and enlightening manner.It was shot on location including at various concerts across North America UK and Europe. I found Dee Snider of Twisted Sister Tony Iommi of Black Sabbath and Ronnie James Dio of Dio accredited as the inventor of the devil horn sign the most compelling interviewees though there were many others too numerous to mention. The sum of the whole turned out a rich result.Unlike many documentaries of late where the primary goal appears to be light entertainment using celebrity heads this film is truly insightful intelligent balanced educational funny and entertaining! Whatever your taste in music I highly recommend it.".

You can't beat the feeling of seeing a massive rock concert and the film manages to capture that feeling with the sights and sounds it is almost like you can smell the sweat. The makers also don't shy away from the controversy that has been levelled at the music over the years and delves into the various court cases and why so many believe it's the devils music.

As someone who's too eclectic to really be solely a metalhead but has been in the realm of the metal world to see how it goes I can empathize with Sam Dunn's main intention with the documentary this music should not be seen as just some goofy crude offensive or dangerous offshoot of oldtime rock n roll not that the last one doesn't apply in one or two cases. It's to show how personal this music and how this 'way of life' can be for a person and how it affects personality but not necessarily in the perceived negative light. Dunn of course has his head totally together which is how he can go headtohead with metal legends or notorious sorts like Tony Iommi Bruce Dickinson Lemmy Alice Cooper Dee Snider Dio and Rob Zombie Geddy Lee is also among the big known interviewees though it's strange to see him here when he's not really 'metal' at least in league with these guys.But through him and his collaborators he is able to get inside not just the offshoots and specifics of the world of heavymetal. The look the style the attitude the controversies both domestic i.e. Dee Snider's battle with Tipper Gore and foreign a superlatively done look at the Norwegian blackmetal scene which is both tense and hilarious the women bands in the world and how it helps some people really get better on with life either to hear it or play it or of course both. Dunn's look is good if by necessity perhaps too too brief as he at one point lists a kind of heavymetal family tree of sorts all too quickly to really see every single one and barely scratches the surface in the 96 minute running time. Maybe there is only so much that can be covered in a featurelength film but the subject matter serves to be even more looked into VH1 had also done a heavymetal documentary and it lasted four hours. On the other hand Dunn and his people actually do get some material here that is more precious and more enlightening. The juxtaposition of the 'true believers' and horrors in Norways blackdeathmetal scene with a band like Slayer who are bad to the bone and have fans who go toe limit is interesting.It's the kind of documentary that really does work for that it's worth but not enough of a good thing is explored for fans. Nonfans may get just enough that they can handle a mix of the basic facts and key points i.e. the coining of the term 'metal' the roots in the blues the devil horns and a look at outrageous album covers. It's good subjective filmmaking though edging a little much on trying to get enough history along with the personal history.".

Such as what the fans are like how they get into metal why they stay with metal and rarely stray from the various genres that it has. Others include sexuality girls in metal and so on.Each aspect of the documentary was soundly explored rationally argued and balanced. For instance on the one hand you get the perspective of groupies and then of groupies from bands. You get differing opinions.In fact the documentary is a boon for both the metal community and the nonmetal community alike. On the one hand the mettles can revel in the exploration of their community and genres on the other the wider community can gain some real insight into the workings of the community.I must admit that some of the humour that our predominantly metal audience felt at the posturing of the Norwegian Black Metal scene and other parts the rest of the audience didn't necessarily get. The humour is often something which you must be part of the community to understand which is why it all appears so serious to the rest of society they don't get the humour.All in all a wellwrought skillfully crafted and well argued documentary. Of course there were subgenres and things missing but you get that with all docos  there just isn't the time to do it. Given the limitations Metal a headbanger's journey makes the most of it and does it well.Highly recommended viewing.".

	schema:reviewBody "This doc is completely awesome in every way I can think of stuff being awesome. It's not even perfect and there's some things in this film that I don't like. However to be honest with you most of this doc is so informative and fun to watch that I still consider it to be one of the best documentaries ever made.First off let me give Sam Dunn some props. He's a lifelong headbanger himself so he's as qualified as anyone should need to be to lead this film. I am also a lifelong headbanger. I also had to defend my love of this style of music to my parents teachers and friends so I understand where his interest in this approach to the subject comes from. I'm sure most fans of heavy metal can attest to being faced with similar challenges while growing up and it was good to see that I am not alone. This was a recurring theme in the film. That if you are a metal fan you may be told or feel that you are weird that you're a real outsider but in fact you have a lot of allies out there in the world. I also like the fact that Sam Dunn has the educational background he does and is obviously making something productive and positive out of his life because too many people do write off metal heads as being stupid low class criminal uncultured and most likely introverted out of touch and mentally unstable. He seems like a real good person in general a friendly and talented guy and a good person to be an ambassador for metal heads everywhere.This doc is an investigative film that asks lots of questions and it gives lot of answers in return. I can't imagine a true fan of music no matter what kind not appreciating the goals of Sam Dunn and his crew in this film. Simply he was looking to find an answer to why heavy metal music and it's fans have been stigmatized and labeled as this horrible thing in our society. This is interesting stuff and it's about time someone stood up and asked the questions answered them and presented it all in a package that no one can discount as being lowbrow. Metal heads across the globe for over 30 years have been asking this very question and it's nice to see someone really tackle it like this.The heavy metal tree is a really cool thing and while I hate the fact that too many discussions surrounding heavy metal spiral downward into arguments over what subgenre a certain band does or doesn't fall into it's a really well thought out visual aid to the film. There is so many great interviews in here and most of them are from really great people. With only a few exceptions I agreed with the views of the people being interviewed but there were a few that left me scratching my head and yelling at the screen. Some of them were way off base but that's okay it only serves to bring light to the fact that many people can't or won't get heavy metal music.But like Sam Dunn says at the end of the film that's okay and I agree with him completely in that no matter if other people understand why I love heavy metal so much the fact is I do love it and I do get it. I'm glad I'm not alone.".

Metal undeground is very complex and the variety is immense  so it is understandable that fitting all this into 90 minutes borders with the impossible.

It encompasses virtually all of metal subgenres like Hard Rock Glam Black Power although I have trouble with defining this sub genre in particular death prog and thrash. The film's mastermind 31 year old Sam Dunn does an excellent job dissecting the genre from its classical and blues origins to why the Scandinavian black metal scene is so evil. He even goes out of his way to set up a genealogical tree for metal! For the metal fan who enjoys or enjoyed some of the metal sub genres presented here heshe will be full of ecstasy and for the uninitiated this is a good place to start. Interviews with SLAYER MOTLEY CRUE EMPEROR IRON MAIDEN MAYHEM DIO BLACK SABBATH RUSH SLIPKNOT KORN ARCH ENEMY TWISTED SISTER etc. will only leave you wanting for more and more. There's a nice flow to the documentary and in my humble opinion wasn't bored in the least.What I didn't like too much was the fact that Sam Dunn barely talks about thrash metal. Yeah he mentions METALLICA MEGADETH and there's the SLAYER interview but this sub genre is the one that gets least mentioned taking into account today's biggest metal band METALLICA arose from the thrash movement.On the other hand black metal and death metal receive more film time. Maybe Sam Dunn wanted to leave the thrash part less explored due to the upcoming thrash documentary GET THRASHED which has been in the making for at least 4 years.Minor complaints aside this documentary rocks and if you're a fan of the genre you'll do no wrong in getting this essential film in your DVD library.

Also I think you already have to know these people to get off of the fact Tom Araya or Dio is being interviewed. Not to mention the people more obscure to the mainstream. Also I found it a bit funny how the film tries to find maturity in heavy metal while probably the lengthiest fan interview is of a 14yearold girl in a studded choker.Another flaw is that few things are explored in depth. The film is constantly skimming on the subject. The anecdotes from the metal giants reveal more about the essence of heavy metal than the actual processed information. A lot of is skipped such as the connection between Norwegian black metal and NeoNazism  even though an interviewee states the black metalists' view themselves as a selected few and that think certain groups must be eliminated where have I heard that before?.Also since the film tries to educate the viewer Dunn should have had taken a bit more educational angle. For example the tritone is mentioned but the viewer probably would get more of it if there actually was an explicit comparison of the demonic notes and the less demonic notes. Now it is just stated that heavy metal traditionally uses a blues scale and Satan's really horrible notes.It is not to say Metal is entirely without any credit. It gives some general insight to the genre and has the correct people talking about it. The only real mistakes are that it tries to take a too big bite and that it's trying to sell freezers to Inuits.".

But as a documentary it lacked A LOT of real information. I certainly did not learn anything new except that cradle of filth is now being considered Norwegian black metal  i mean who made these categories? Is it sloppiness or lack of knowledge? and I'm not sure nonmetal heads would learn much either. I have a real problem with the gendersexuality bit the word sexism was thrown out but not used in a single coherent thought... the only all female metal band they covered is girlschool! really? I would have appreciated hearing more of an intelligent analysis or theory of why metal either is or perceived to be a male heterosexual and WHITE genre. Maybe that's asking too much but therein lies the problem of this doc. Its too ambitious tries to explain the whole culture and history of metal in 90 minutes! It clearly lacked focus and would have done much better honing in on a particular area but that would require more research instead of jerking off every interviewee... however maybe this film has inspired and opened doors for future film makers to really explore various nuisances in the metal scene... one can only hope.".

	schema:reviewBody "I surprisingly found this DVD hidden in dark and secluded section of a local DVD store mostly reserved for B grade flicks art and indie material. Me being a metalhead myself was thrilled about watching a documentary that digs into the world's most controversial and forbidden style of musicartlife. The experience was a little odd.The first few seconds into the film when the all familiar intro of Number of the Beast began with the clips of metalheads on screen I shivered the hairs on the back of my neck standing up. I felt something very rare I felt I'm at home baby! m I won't go ramble on about the things everyone knows. Yes this film is awesome. It has that rare atmosphere that only a true metalhead could create like Sam Dunn. If you are a true rocker you'll feel in sync with the guy you'll know what he is talking about and why but if you aren't into metal you'll have a hard time understanding some of the meaning.My biggest problem with this doc is the same as the others it's too superficial. For me it's too much about satanism gore and torching of churches. For me metal is not about that. Metal is a form of expression a way of life. I wanted to see more about metal from around the world.For an anthropologist Dunn is far too concerned about the different styles of back and death metal rather than reviewing metal as a phenomenon and culture around the world. He focuses on the US and Norway but that is just a little piece of the big picture. What about the rest of Europe? What about eastern metal or other regions of the world? What about the other genres of metal? I wanted to hear more about the different genres the history and pioneers of each of them...etc how those evolved and transformed over the years and who are the artists that made it happen.In a nutshell it's too onesided too narrow perspective. I know it's only 90 minutes but it could've been done. Okay I'm maybe splitting hairs here. I agree it's a decent documentary and for such an pardon the term amateur team it's a very good film about metal but it left me with a nagging feeling of something's missing it's somehow not complete and I guess that's what most people are feeling about this documentary. The interviews are very well done but with the wrong people. I wanted to hear more big names more name bands and real pioneers of metal. I know the film is very lowbudget and they probably couldn't pay for an interview with Ozzy Lars Joacim Cans or even Serj Tankian but I really miss those bits from a documentary about metal. Other than that its a pleasant experience and I recommend it for every metalhead and nonmetalhead out there.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just saw the screening with the film makers on hand. I wish I could have joined them afterwards at the bar which they invited us all to but I've gotta work tomorrow. Oh well.The film was what I had expected. I wasn't expecting a definitive work on one of my favorite kinds of music but rather what had been touted as a loveletter to heavy metal artists and fans. That it was. It was funny in parts interesting in parts not overly educational but all in all just what I had wanted...a longhaired downtoearth guy giving an overview of us metalheads and some of the music bands and metal styles that makes us happy. This was not a corny VH1 type of special but rather a heartfelt tip of the hat to a culture that is still going on with teenagers and with us slightly older folks. The teens get their release at the end of a school day and us older ones get our release when we come home from work. We all crank up the metal.It is a film that is at once scattered in it's presentation but also held together by it's topic. It has a good enough array of commentary from musicians that keeps the pace flowing well. Most of the musician interviews come with at least one good oneliner making metalheads and nonmetalheads grin with or grin at the subject. Specifically as much of a blip as Twisted Sister was in the 80's and I am not a fan I keep noticing through the years that Dee Snider is a very adept articulate and funny person. In my mind he is probably the best spokesman for the heavy metal community. He had me laughing.I think this film speaks more to the fact that metal is a release. Some people get it and some people don't but for some reason it works perfectly to some of us who use the music to let loose no matter what sub genre we are into. This was a great loveletter to metal for both young and old and I look forward to the DVD with the extra footage.".

Now there is no doubt some interest in a fanboy waxing lyrical about their favourite things but what raises this documentary above the average is that Sam Dunn just happens to be a scholaran anthropologistthus ensuring that the content is well thought out and articulated.Of particular fascination to me was the family tree diagram featured frequently in this docu of how the various genres of heavy metal relate to each other...that must be the anthropology angle kicking in I think. When I contacted a site related to this docu someone mentioned that the DVD of this may have the diagram or at least future editions would as a distinct element of the DVD.The docu covers heavy metal as a genreit's various subbranches and its putative father so to speak. What was particularly good about this was that whilst Dunn did posit who he thought created heavy metal as a genre Black Sabbath he does provide video footage of bands which piqued my interest in the subject and which could perhaps be argued to have created the genre themselves. In other words you don't get a completely biased view of the subject from Dunn.Many of the legends of the genre are interviewed in this docuTommy Iommi from Black Sabbath Alice Cooper Lemmy from Motorhead and Iron Maiden's Bruce Dickinson. Not being a great fan of Iron Maiden I must say that Dickinson was a highlight of this docu for his honest and insightful comments on the art of performing.As there is a school of thought perhaps that Metallica are the pinnacle of this genre they are conspicuous by their large absence from this docu.I've reviewed some heavy metal albums at Amazon under this id. e.g. Coldseed.".

I for example may have liked to hear more full acts of music and I am wondering why Gothic rock did not get some coverage.

It's weird seeing a documentary about this music since I can relate so much to some of his experiences and feelings. Like how he always has had to defend metal because most people look down on it as a lesser form of music. And how he just doesn't bother to do it anymore because if you feel it you feel it and if you don't chances are that you never will.I saw this movie with someone who had a very different approach to it than me. I have been into this kind of music for almost 20 years and she has never listened to it but came along because she was curious. We both liked it and got something out of it so that means they must have done something right. For people not into metal they might learn something and they might get their preconceived opinions about the music and it's fans adjusted just a bit.

If you ever were into Metal you'll already know most of the facts presented here. What makes the movie worth watching anyway are the comments by some genredefining and some underground musicians that have been interviewed. Unfortunately Sam Dunn couldn't get all the important Metal bands so he has to do without contributions by Deep Purple Led Zeppelin Judas Priest Metallica Anthrax Megadeth or Pantera which makes Metal seem a bit random.Very rarely are we getting substantial insight into the minds of those who listen to Metal or even contribute half their life to it. An explanation like Metal is always there for you come what may just isn't very enlightening. I mean soccer fans will say the same about soccer right? So no this documentary doesn't tell you things you hadn't already known before but it helps you to relume your passion about Metal. And the interviews are often quite hilarious.

Gable never looks quite natural but does seem to contain a reservoir of strength and energy that lurks just beneath the surface of his peaceful character. At least that's my view from this time and place hard to imagine what effect his performance would have had on a 1931 audience just becoming familiar with that face that screen presence.The highlight of the film is almost certainly Joan's dance in an opening scenedonning a fake nose and beard and a farmer outfit she humorously bounces around for a couple of minutes before shedding the costume and really cutting loose to her audience's delight and her own obvious joy. It has to be said that Joan as flapper is quite a bit more exciting than Joan as saved woman. Hamilton is superb in a thoroughly despicable role. Roscoe Karns and Guy Kibbee are fellow salesman and together they certainly portray the kind of sleazy crew who inspire good people to lock up their daughters.Overallno surprises but Crawford is certainly worth watching especially the opening and closing minutes.".

This was after having seen them together in Dance Fools Dance where Gable was a villain and had only a couple of scenes with Crawford. This is according to Joan herself in a tribute she wrote in the Citadel Film Series Book The Films of Clark Gable.Crawford is definitely in her element as singerdancer and good time Prohibition party girl who falls for the charms of Neil Hamilton a traveling salesman. You know what a bunch of party animals they are just ask Arthur Miller. Anyway Hamilton decides though he thinks Joan's great in the hay he wants to marry the boss's daughter and does leaving her flat and despondent.One night as she's ready to throw herself off a bridge Salvation Army worker Clark Gable stops her. She likes him but still has a yen for Hamilton and he her.Given Clark Gable's later image the casting of him as a Salvation Army worker is ludicrous. Mayer knew that and during the course of the film he gives him a nice prison background before he joined Edwin Booth's Army. The only way Gable could possibly fit the part. Anyway Mayer did it for the obvious chemistry between Gable and Crawford.It's more Joan's picture than his though. Later on her talents as a dancer which brought her to film in the first place would be not seen at all. So Laughing Sinners is a treat in that way.The film is based on a Broadway play Torch Song which ran for 87 performances the year before and starred Mayo Methot Reed Brown and Russell Hicks in the parts that Crawford Hamilton and Gable have. Coming over from the Broadway cast is Guy Kibbee in the role of another salesman the only one to repeat his role from Broadway. Roscoe Karns and Cliff Edwards play another pair of salesmen and Marjorie Rambeau is Crawford's party girl friend.Russell Hicks is definitely more my idea of a Salvation Army worker but Gable's more my idea of a leading man opposite Joan Crawford.".

Nightclub performer Ivy Stevens Joan Crawford is despondent upon learning Howard Howdy Palmer Neil Hamilton has no intention of marrying her. She was just a booty call to our boy Howdy. How Neil Hamilton got so many roles in the early '30s as a ladies man type is beyond me but that's how it was then I guess. Anyway Ivy decides to jump off a bridge but she is stopped by kindly and handsome Salvation Army worker Carl a mustacheless Clark Gable. Ivy joins up with the Salvation Army too and is seemingly happy with her new lifestyle. But then one day Howdy spots her and despite being married now makes a move for her. Can Ivy resist Howdy's seductive ways? Can any woman?There's a few things wrong with this movie. First on no planet does Joan freaking Crawford at this time a young and sexy dancer get that upset over being dumped by Neil Hamilton. He was born looking like a banker. So that's unbelievable. Second and third things are that Clark Gable is no Salvation Army worker and he sure as hell isn't a guy named Carl! Joan's farmer dance is the highlight of the movie and probably her best dancing number from all of her early dancing movies. Overall it's a watchable but mostly forgettable melodrama about a wrong woman going right. Avid Crawford and Gable fans will like it most.".

Anyway Ivy decides to jump off a bridge but she is stopped by kindly and handsome Salvation Army worker Carl a mustacheless Clark Gable.

	schema:reviewBody "This film is probably the weakest of the GableCrawford film pairings. It's not that their performances aren't great it's just that they're not given that much to do. The storyline is very basic  Joan is a performer in a nightspot who has had a longdistance affair going with a traveling salesman Howard Palmer Neil Hamilton for the past two years. He dumps her to marry the boss' daughter so he can further his career. He doesn't even have the courage to tell this to her face  he writes it on the back of a menu at the cafe and leaves before she reads it.This action wounds Ivy Joan to the core and she is about to jump off a bridge one night when she is stopped by a Salvation Army member Carl Loomis Clark Gable. The two become friends and pretty soon Ivy is donning a Salvation Army uniform herself. One night a year later when Ivy and the Salvation Army are proselyting in a nearby town she runs into her exlover Howard Palmer. After a year of separation Howard has decided he would like to have it both ways  he'd like to have his bang Ivy and his bucks his wife of convenience. Will Ivy stand firm on her new beliefs or will she fall? This film does have a few good things going for it. In the first part of the film when Ivy is still working in the nightclub we get to see Joan sing and dance for an entire number. She doesn't do much of that in her long film career and it is always a treat. Then there is the somewhat ridiculous spectacle of Clark Gable as a Salvation Army worker  this is before he became known more as a charming sinner rather than a laughing one. You can chalk up that bit of casting to Louis B. Mayer. This film was originally shot with Johnny Mack Brown in the lead but Mayer didn't like the outcome and reshot it with Gable. Finally there is Neil Hamilton as one of the most slippery characters you'll find. Hard to believe he didn't have a real career breakthrough for almost another 35 years when he was cast as Batman's Commissioner Gordon.This whole issue of the thin line between good and evil in a person and the fact that those two sides exist in everyone is much more artfully explored in 1932's Rain again starring Joan Crawford. That's a film I highly recommend.".

	schema:reviewBody "Laughing Sinners is surely some good publicity for The Salvation Army. The plot of IvyBunny Joan Crawford leaving her previous life behind and finding happiness in the helping of others is moralising but never came off to me as overly preachy. I like Laughing Sinners despite the film's inconsistency with sections of the movie having little to no impact on the overall story. The first twenty minutes of set up for example could easily have been done in half the time. Yet despite this there is a powerful emotional undercurrent at the heart of Laughing Sinners with a number of highly moving scenes making up for the less than stellar portions of the film.At least some of these weaker moments are made passable from the presence of a comical stereotypical Italian chef to a bizarre dance number in which Joan Crawford is dressed as a scarecrow go figure. Likewise another real highlight in Laughing Sinners is a scene in the park depicting a charity picnic which has such naturalism in both its documentarylike appearance as well as the acting a piece of neorealism which doesn't feel like a movie set.As soon as Clark Gable enters the picture at 22 minutes the film truly takes off. Any scene with Crawford and Gable is pure magic with the sincerity in their interactions which at no point feels like acting. I don't think there's any other actress of the time who can as effectively as Crawford make you pour out your heart for the poor woman and rarely has she ever looked as angelic as she does here in her Salvation Army uniform. Likewise many people will laugh at the idea of Clark Gable playing a Salvation Army officer but Laughing Sinners provides a side of Gable I wish more people could see. Like his role of Dr Ferguson in Men In White 1934 the part of Carl Loomis is saintly without delving into the sickly with his ability to project a real sense of warmth especially with his interaction with children.This is one of the few films in Gable's career in which he isn't a romantic lead as he only remains in the friendzone with Joan. Never again would we see Gable as more of a boy scout and less the alpha male as he cooks wears sweaters and aprons and lives with his aunt.".

Laughing Sinners was lightened up considerably over the stage version and according to Crawford the whole film was shot with Johnny Mack Brown in the role ultimately awarded to Gable being reshot with Gable on the orders of Louis B. Mayer. On Broadway Crawford's role was portrayed by illfated actress Mayo Methot later to marry Humphrey Bogart.It is directed by Harry Beaumont who handled Crawford's silent jazz baby films and later Dancing Lady. For Crawford Laughing Sinners straddles a precipice between her singing and dancing activity and that of more serious drama although already a star her 1932 entries  Grand Hotel and Rain  would propel her status and popularity well beyond that of 1931. While it is a huge improvement over terribly stiff talkies like Garbo's Anna Christie Laughing Sinners is not Beaumont's best work and the musical sequences are in some ways still the best thing about it. Crawford dominates the first half of the film and it's her boundless energy and enthusiasm that drives it. She is especially beautiful here and her eyes radiate emotion in the scene where she receives the dear Jane letter from firstclassheel Neil Hamilton the reaction is played entirely through Crawford's ominous orbs. The most remarkable thing about it though is that Gable refuses to lay down and to let Crawford run away with this picture which may have been what Mayer had in mind when he recast the role this would prove the first of eight pictures Gable and Crawford would make together. In a sense this picture feels like a test for the principals and if so Neil Hamilton fails it he is stiff and colorless and one wonders why Crawford's dynamic character could be so head over heels with such a backslapping good buddy. Some have mentioned that Laughing Sinners strains credibility somewhat but within the context of 1931 the whole piece is well within the realm of the plausible many American joined up with service and charity organizations such as the Salvation Army as a way to weather the economic depths of the depression. There are many scenes in Laughing Sinners that depression audiences could relate to such as Crawford's spartan accommodations and the meal that Crawford and Gable share. The original play was set in a hotel and train station in Pomeroy Ohio and Ohioans will note references to Ohio place names though there are no native exteriors.".

	schema:reviewBody "Laughing Sinners marks the first time Clark Gable appeared in a movie starring Joan Crawford. Crawford is the only name above the title and Gable is listed third in the cast list after Neil Hamilton who would be better known as Commissioner Gordon in the Batman TV series. Crawford is a singerdancer who falls for the traveling salesman Hamilton. He abandons her while she sings a love song for him. Gable plays a Salvation Army man who saves Joan from jumping off a bridge and convinces her to join. While she performs on a street corner Hamilton sees Crawford and convinces her to stay in his hotel room. I'll stop right there and mention who else is in this movie Guy Kibbee Roscoe Karns Cliff Edwards before he became the voice of Jiminy Cricket in Pinocchio and in a nice picnic scene with Gable and Crawford Our Ganger Mary Ann Jackson hair bob and all. There are some entertaining musical numbers danced by Crawford including an amusing sequence of Joan dressing as a farmer with funny nose and beard. Other than that and the picnic scenes this is a pretty talky picture that reveals its stage origins too clearly toward the end so you may feel bored after a while. Still an interesting curio for fans of all the above players.".

	schema:headline " Laughing Melodrama Is More Like It";
	schema:reviewBody "Laughing Sinners 1931  out of 4 Boring predictable and at times laughable melodrama from MGM features Joan Crawford playing Ivy a naive girl who has her heart broken by a scumbag Neil Hamilton so she decides to kill herself. A Salvation Army preacher Clark Gable saves her from doing so and try to get her back on track but soon the old boyfriend shows up. LAUGHING SINNERS is such a bad film that it could only be saved by two screen legends who are both horribly miscast. It's strange that the performances would be what saves this film because the truth is that the performances really aren't that good. I think this film will mainly appeal to diehard fans of Crawford and Gable who want to see what the two do in a lousy movie where both of them are playing roles that simply aren't suited for them. I've give them both credit for at least trying to pull the parts off but in the end they just don't work. I think one of the main problems is that both are so strong that it's hard to see them playing such soft characters. Crawford is somewhat charming playing the naive girl at the start of things but where she really heats up is towards the end when she's faced with a dilemma. The same can be said for Gable who just isn't believable as the softspoken preacher but he too picks up at the end when the muscles come out. Hamilton is rather forgettable in the role of the boyfriend and even Guy Kibbee is wasted in his supporting role. The screenplay is a real mess because it takes 25minutes for the breakup to actually happen and then we have to sit through more melodrama and I'm sure you know how it's all going to end. Another problem is that the direction by Harry Beaumont is just so lifeless that everything drags. LAUGHING SINNERS is a pretty embarrassing movie but I still think fans of Crawford and Gable will remain mildly entertained just by seeing the two in roles that don't make them look too good.".

	schema:reviewBody "LAUGHING SINNERS MetroGoldwynMayer 1931 directed by Harry Beaumont is a dramatic story that may contain some sinners in the cast but in the most part are not laughing except for a scene involving a drunken party. The movie in question happens to be a new title to a Broadway play Torch Song by Kenyon Nicholson starring Joan Crawford in her mission of mercy. Not as well known as one would expect it's more notable for being Crawford's rematch under the direction of Harry Beaumont from DANCE FOOLS DANCE 1931 along with actor on the rise by the name of Clark Gable elevated in the cast from seventh in the previous film to third in this latest edition. While Gable played mean tough guys in such 1931 releases as THE PAINTED DESERT Pathe NIGH NURSE Warner Brothers THE FINGER POINTS First National and reaching the peak of his career treating Norma Shearer rough in A FREE SOUL LAUGHING SINNERS offers Gable an opportunity playing a nice guy as he did earlier in THE EASIEST WAY 1931 an image he would soon endure through much of his career from this point forward.The story opens as a Pembroke train station on a rainy night where Ivy Stevens Joan Crawford runs to and on board the passing train where she meets with Howard Palmer Neil Hamilton a traveling salesman whom she has known for two years. This time she joins him and his fellow salesmen Fred Geer Roscoe Karns the sardine king and Mike Cliff Edwards the ukulele singer to their next stop. Spending time with Howard Ivy acquires a cabaret job singing and dancing for its patrons where she has become close friends with an older showgirl Ruby Marjorie Rambeau. During a performance where Ivy dedicates a song to the man she loves Howard it is Howard who then writes her a farewell note as he is about to run off and marry Estelle the bosses daughter. Totally distressed and betrayed Ivy takes a walk to jump off a bridge. Her chances of suicide are stopped by the passing Carl Loomis Clark Gable a Salvation Army man who talks her out of destroying her precious gift of life. During the course of a year Ivy now a member of the Salvation Army and winning new friends meets up with Howard again. Although still married he wants to win her back and return to her life of sin. Others in the cast include Guy Kibbee Cass Wheeler a mortician salesman of underground novelty a role Kibbee reprised from the stage Gertrude Short Edna George Cooper Joe George Marion Humpty the cabaret manager Clara Blandick and the dark haired thin faced Mary Ann Jackson from those early Our Gang comedies for Hal Roach as the little girl in the picnic scene at Lincoln Park.As in DANCE FOOLS DANCE Crawford displays her singing and dancing ability with her night club singing first with her Red Hot Dance dressed up like a bearded hillbilly in overalls and false nose and a solo torch song spotlight singing What Can I Do? I Love That Man by Martin Brones and Arthur Freed.A major change in Gable's recent villainous performances to a wider range of his newfound character. Still minus his famous mustache Gable again gathers much attention in his second of eight collaborations opposite Crawford that would last until another religious themedprison story STRANGE CARGO 1940. Neil Hamilton resumes his second lead performance as he did in other MGM productions and Cliff Edwards who had a sizable role in DANCE FOOLS DANCE has little to do this time around. Other than her dancing and her character part of the Salvation Army crew the big surprise here is finding the darkhaired brunette Crawford becoming a darkhaired blonde.LAUGHING SINNERS succeeds mostly through its casting and little on its direction but overall a passable 72 minutes of betrayal and redemption story from a woman's point of view. Available on home video and DVD as well as broadcasts on Turner Classic Movies especially during either Crawford or Gable tributes and festivals. 12".

She is regularly beaten by her prizefighter father underfed and wears ragged clothes. Even in this deplorable condition Cheng can see that she is a priceless beauty and he falls in love with her from afar. On the day that she passes out in front of his store he takes her in and cares for her. With nothing but love in his heart he dresses her in silks and provides food for her.

There really is no choice the only version worth seeing is this one the Brownlow  Gill UK remaster with Louis F. Gottchalk's themes lushly orchestrated by David Cullen and Carl Davis and the Thames Silents Orchestra. From a good silent film Broken Blossoms is beautifully transformed into a work of Art the merger of the music and Billy Bitzer's visuals can be so striking. And the intelligent tinting was gorgeous too. Over the years I've even played it just for the music sometimes!The story? Depressed Chinese exmissionary in London falls under the spell of listless povertystricken beautiful white 15 yo daughter of violent boxer. The crafty and base whites think the worst but we know that the yellow man's love remained pure  even his worst foe says this ... I know that most people today would hoot at the acting abilities displayed Lillian Gish's pathetic submissiveness Donald Crisp's over the top savage expressions and Richard Barthelmess's determinedly serious inscrutability but appreciation of silent melodramas as a genre is really required rather than simply selecting just one film to watch such as this. And then again some people have to get over a white man playing a Chinese man whilst simultaneously approving of miscegenation in these much more enlightened times! Would these same people be bothered if a Chinese played a white man? Along with Birth of a Nation and Intolerance this was Griffiths' best work pinnacles of the cinema.Utterly spellbinding poetic stuff for the enlightened dreadful if your favourites are cgiriddled and no older than 6 months. And don't expect a remotely happy ending! The beauty that all the world missed smote him to the heart paraphrase.".

The quote above accompanied by his sad look as he leans against the wall of his curio shop tell it all wrecked youthful enthusiasmhis despair only temporarily abated by the pipe in the Limehouse opium dens. His dreams of youth all packed away in his garret are only brought out when the one thing that gives him hope that is goodness amidst all the squalor stumbles into his shop.Only after Lucy arrives can Chen Huan allow himself to dreamto return to golden days of learning beauty and goodness and ideals. He literally places his dreams of his lost youth on the trembling body of Lucy but it such a pristine ideal he dare not defame it or it too will disappear like all his other dreams. He must observe it from afaralmost ephemeral. He knows what Hell is like even before he was shown the booklet by the Christian Brothers. His hell is his lost heart his lost love.

	schema:reviewBody "BROKEN BLOSSOMS United Artists 1919 directed by DW Griffith is a little film that's not only quite melodramatic but terribly terribly sad. In fact it's labeled as American cinema's first tragedy. Unlike Griffith's epic masterpieces as THE BIRTH OF A NATION 1915 and INTOLERANCE 1916 each running over two hours in length BROKEN BLOSSOMS is in fact a simple story focusing on three central characters Richard Barthelmess Donald Crisp and Lillian Gish in order of their appearance that deals with touchy subject matters ranging from racial prejudice to child abuse topics that are still sensitive issues even today.Based on Thomas Burke's The Chink and the Child the story begins in China where Cheng Haun also known as The Yellow Man Richard Barthelmess a young idealist coming to the London slums where he hopes to convert rude Westerners to the gospel of the gentle Buddha. Instead he makes his living by running a curio shop. Battling Burrows Donald Crisp a smalltime prizefighter by which the title cards describes him as an abysmal brute a gorilla from the jungles of East London living with his illegitimate daughter Lucy Lillian Gish a tragic figure who waits on him hand and foot. So terrified of him whenever her father commands her to smile the frightful Lucy simply pushes up the corners of her mouth with her fingers. After one of her frequent beatings one night Lucy stumbles out of the house walking to the Chinese curio shop where she faints in front of Cheng Haun's door. Cheng Haun finds bruised girl and takes her in tending to her wounds. While under his care Lucy called White Blossom by the Chinaman is treated with the kindness and sensitivity she's never had. When Battling Burrows is told of his daughter's whereabouts he sets out to get the dirty Chink and to learn them both.In spite of its oldfashioned screenplay with the use of a white actor Barthelmess in an Oriental role BROKEN BLOSSOMS is still timely. Lillian Gish gives an Academy Award winning performance playing the 15yearold Lucy Burrows. Academy Award meaning that if the best actress award had existed in 1919 Gish would definitely have been recognized with that honor for her achievement in handling a difficult assignment in a believable manner. For famous climatic closet scene in which Gish's character Lucy locks herself in to avoid another brutal whipping by her father is as realistic as any performance could ever be. As Burrows breaks the door apart piece by piece with an ax the terrified Lucy with no place to run nor hide goes into a frenzy like an trapped animal. Being a silent film one can virtually hear the screaming coming through the screen. For this scene alone Gish has proved her capability as one of the finest actresses in this history of film.With such a depressing theme BROKEN BLOSSOMS reportedly was a surprise hit upon its release. A very atypical Griffith production to say the least. The sole reason for its success is how Lucy is portrayed on screen ranging from her tragically sad face and shoulderlength hair adding to the believability to her character knowing full well that Gish was a young woman in her early twenties enacting the role of a 12 to 15 yearold child. Donald Crisp the most unlikely candidate in getting any Father's Day cards after this performance would appear as lovable fathers in numerous family films of the 1940s as well as earning an Academy Award as Best Supporting Actor for HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY 20thFox 1941. It was fortunate to Crisp's credit that his performance of the unsympathetic prizefighter with the colleyflower ear didn't ruin his future in films. Barthelmess on the other hand offers a sensitive portrayal of a caring and peaceful Chinaman against the wicked ways of the world. This is the film that elevated Barthelmess to the rank as top leading man through much of the 1920s one opposite Gish again under Griffith's direction in another classic tale WAY DOWN EAST 1920.With a limited amount of actors listed in the cast the supporting players consists of Arthur Howard as the fighting manager Edward Piel as Evil Eye Norman Kid McCoy Selby as a prizefighter and George Nicholas as the Policeman. And was that Roscoe Karns as the reporter in the final portion of the story?BROKEN BLOSSOMS was one of the twelve selected silent films that was broadcast on public television's 1975 presentation of THE SILENT YEARS as hosted by Lillian Gish. Prior to its presentation Gish discussed how the movie came about and did so again practically word for word in the 1988 Thames video presentation prior to the feature presentation scored by Carl Davis. Over later years BROKEN BLOSSOMS had been released under numerous video distributors with different music scores and different lengths. The Thames Republic Home Video organ scored and KINO Video collections with pleasing orchestration comes closer to the original length of 90 to 95 minutes restoring the opening segment and plot development missing from The Silent Years broadcast set in China involving Cheng before coming to the Limehouse district of England. The restored KINO version had been the print used for Turner Classic Movies' Silent Sunday Nights for quite some time before converting to new but inappropriate underscoring.BROKEN BLOSSOMS has become the kind of movie in which success comes only once. This tragic tale was remade in England with sound in 1936 but little is known of it today except for the fact that Griffith was originally slated to be the director. While the 1919 original may not be the sort of movie for all tastes it's one that will be long remembered thanks to the remarkable direction by the master D.W. Griffith and sensitive portrayals of Gish and Barthelmess combined. ".

	schema:reviewBody "With some excellent acting performances and an interesting memorable story Broken Blossoms is one of the better pictures of the late 1910s and it has held up rather well despite a couple of obvious signs of age. It would be hard to top Lillian Gish's performance as Lucy in any era and Richard Barthelmess turns in a purposefully restrained and surprisingly effective performance in a role that was far from easy.The story ties together several weighty themes and most of them are still pertinent. This is the kind of movie that is sometimes considered to be dated yet in terms of the main conflicts and struggles that the characters face there are probably fewer differences between 1919 and 2004 than many might wish there to be. With material like this it is also easy to allow it to become labored or heavyhanded. As it is the tone is somber and austere throughout yet most of the time this is in a thoughtful way.Since Griffith's work is still so wellknown and meets with such widely varying responses it can sometimes be hard to evaluate his movies individually without reference to the rest of his filmography. The story here is unusual enough in itself with the different races and religions of the characters and the implied images represented by each of them. Each character is rather quickly defined as good or bad  a common state of affairs in Griffith movies  and as a result the story is told in a way that reflects that presumption for better or for worse.What is hard to deny is that the story and characters will stick with you afterwards. The impression that it leaves is not an entirely happy one but the movie successfully evokes the humanity of all involved which is a not unworthy goal and a not insignificant achievement.".

No huge casts rampaging through innumerable subplots no tremendous production values spent to illustrate the sweep  flow of a historical period. Just three people living increasingly desperate lives brought together by a tidal wave of pure emotion.Lillian Gish was right thinking she was too old to play the young girl and she did so only at Griffith's insistence but it is impossible to contemplate anyone else in the role. She is utterly luminous as the abused child who finds a few moments of glorious affection with the young foreigner from the East. Miss Gish's magically expressive face creates a classic cinema moment when she attempts to smile to save herself from a beating pushing up the corners of her mouth with two fingers while her tormented eyes reveal to the viewer her deep pain and fear. Later in her celebrated closet scene like a trapped animal she releases an explosion of frenzy which is still difficult to watch as her attacker uses a hatchet to smash the barrier between them. Miss Lillian had started rehearsals while weakened from the Spanish Flu she created a movie portrait which caught her genius forever.Matching her in almost every particular is her costar Richard Barthelmess who gives a most sensitive portrayal as the Chinese missionary who comes to England to proselytize for Buddha but instead finds himself alone  friendless in the squalor of the great city. Barthelmess uses his eyes almost exclusively to express what's in his heart bringing enormous dignity  repose to his role. It is too easy today to criticize a performer for playing an ethnic role but once to be able to do so convincingly was considered the hallmark of a capable actor. Barthelmess does so with both conviction  distinction bringing the film to a heartbreaking conclusion.Rounding out the threesome is Englishman Donald Crisp. Although in reality the most gentle and affable of men he nonetheless made a career during the Silent Era of playing violent brutes never more despicable than here. His character glories in the terrors he inflicts on Miss Lillian the viewer loathes him and his eventual fate is most welcome  well deserved.The film almost didn't get released. Paramount Pictures boss Adolph Zukor hated it he thought it too morbid. Griffith raised the operating costs of 91000 and purchased the film releasing it through United Artists. Receptive audiences helped it make millions. As Miss Lillian said decades later Griffith put tragic poetry on the screen for the first time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Following the elaborate spectacles that were The Birth of a Nation and Intolerance D.W. Griffith seemed to have the formula intact for success. With broad sets hundreds of extras three hour epics and tales told over years and even millenniums in the case of Intolerance the 90 minute Broken Blossoms would seem to have a handicap of sorts.  It is but a simple morality tale involving three people that goes horribly awry.  But true to Griffith form it works...and it works nearly perfect.Gone are the visions of what formed countries what creates intolerance and the climaxes involving hundreds of people.  Broken Blossoms is a mere story of forbidden love if such occurrences can actually be called mere. And although the sets used to portray the foggy gloom and forbidding darkness of London's Limehouse district were indeed expensive this was a film carried by its only three stars and one that relies totally on the telling of a story.Richard Barthelmess plays Cheng Huan a Buddhist missionary who now takes residence in Limehouse.  His original intentions to help the violent AngloSaxons understand pacifism are subverted by his opium addiction.  He runs a small shop in the fog of the city and it becomes his own depressed microcosmic world.  The stunning Lilian Gish who seemingly has no bounds as an actress or as an object of feminine beauty plays Lucy the daughter of an abusive alcoholic boxer.  Donald Crisp plays this part so well that the lack of sound does not inhibit the volume of cruelty he enforces on his only daughter nor our ability to feel her level of sheer pain and suffering.Although all three of them may technically may be viewed as broken and products of their own respective worlds when those worlds clash with each other and tragedy seems more likely it is Gish who steals the show. Especially under Griffith's direction.  And while Griffith may have already given the cinema more than its fair share of technological nuances with his first two features he still manages to find subtle bits of direction that affect one's viewing of this sordid triangle Gish's physical inability to smile and her seeking of solitude in something as simple as a flower cannot be emphasized enough as the film goes along.Political historians may note that Griffith is up to his usual tricks of racism as it is portrayed in the Asian who is played by the white Barthelmess but this is unfounded.  If anything his character is uplifting or at least attempts to be.  One gets the feeling that his race does not impact the story's eventual ending despite what Crisp may bellow while drunk.  Crisp's pleasure comes from Gish's pain and anyone regardless of race that tried to interfere would not have caused any sort of behavior change.  Of course the Asian stereotypes of pacifism opium addiction and flowery imagery are played up to some degree but one can hardly argue over the degree of truth in them more than the story's beginning that sees drunken sailors duking it out at the shipyards over next to nothing.  And it allows the film to have its ironic coda to boot.In more detailed film classes Broken Blossoms will get its share of time but overall Griffith will always have Birth of a Nation and Intolerance printed boldly next to his name with this film being more of a footnote. That is unfortunate because it stands up well for the time involves excellent early character acting and hits us closer to home...and to our heart.The nutshell  I still believe this should be required viewing.  The bigness of Griffith may be gone but he has aptly replaced it by creating atmosphere both in terms of environment and in people.  The small story of insignificant lives trapped by their own measures suits Griffith Gish and Crisp extremely well...910.".

	schema:reviewBody "Eschewing the epic grandeur of his previous works like Birth Of A Nation and Intolerance Broken Blossoms is an exquisitely crafted tragedy from D.W. Griffith. Whilst perhaps not his most important film it could very possibly be his most perfect.Heartwarming and heartbreaking in equal measure it is the story of an all too brief innocent love between two broken souls amongst unbearable poverty and brutality. Richard Barthelmess plays Chen The Yellow Man a noble soul full of peace and love who as the film opens leaves his homeland to spread the word of Buddha to white barbarians in England. However the film cuts forward a few years and we find Chen living amidst the squalor of Londons docklands. His hope crushed by the drudgery and vice that surrounds him he flits between his small shop and an opium den where he loses himself in gambling and drugs.There is however one ray of light. Lucy Liilian Gish an illegitimate fifteen year old girl who suffers daily abuse at the hands of her brutal prizefighting father Donald Crisp. Unable to smile after years of torment she shuffles through the streets past Chens window everyday stopping at the opposite shop to look at the flowers she longs to be able to afford. When she returns home she is treated like a slave in constant fear of her fathers wrath. One night he goes goes too far and beats her to within an inch of her life. She manages to crawl out of her hovel only to collapse inside Chens doorway. Their fate is now set. He treats her with the gentleness that she has never known whilst she reignites the innocence in his heart. Yet tragedy inevitably looms.Such was the power of the romantic partnership Richard Barthelmess and Lillian Gish they were to be drawn together again by Griffith in the following years Way Down East. Although modern audiences may raise eyebrows at the thought of an American actor playing a Chinese immigrant these things must be seen in the context of their day. Besides Barthelmess with his slender good looks and sad eyes perfectly captures the starved yearnings of Chen whilst the tenderness of his character is captured in his slow graceful movements.Yet it is Lillian Gish who is the revelation. Already a well known star under the guidance of Griffith she raised the bar for screen acting to extraordinary heights in Broken Blossoms and once and for all confirmed herself as the greatest actress of the silent era light years ahead of her contemporaries. Just watching her in this film is like watching a lesson in screen acting. Not a gesture is wasted as she haunts the mazey alleyways of East London whilst in dreamlike soft focus close up she radiates beauty and charm through her grimy downtrodden appearance. Her final screen moments capture perhaps the defining image of defiance in the face of adversity.Besides the groundbreaking acting I could recommend Broken Blossoms for so many different reasons. The soft camerawork gives procedures an ethereal dream like quality whilst the framing of both closeups and the interior sets is exemplary. Almost every frame drips with care and attention to detail. The film also riffs numerously on dark wit and irony. At one point a zealous minister tells Chen that his brother leaves for China tomorrow to convert the heathen whilst later a policeman talks of only 40000 casualties this week in a reference to the Great War. On top of this there is the brave representation interracial love and subsequent all destroying racism. Similarly the brutal scenes of child abuse Please daddy don't are terrifying as Lucy cowers in the corner begging for mercy.This film really is a complete work from one of the masters of American cinema at his very peak. If Birth Of A Nation showed the World the vast possibilities of this still new art form then Broken Blossoms proved it could have a soul too.".

On top of this there is the brave representation interracial love and subsequent all destroying racism. Similarly the brutal scenes of child abuse Please daddy don't are terrifying as Lucy cowers in the corner begging for mercy.This film really is a complete work from one of the masters of American cinema at his very peak. If Birth Of A Nation showed the World the vast possibilities of this still new art form then Broken Blossoms proved it could have a soul too.";

	schema:reviewBody "Broken Blossoms is uncharacteristically depressing for a film by D.W. Griffith. He had produced many melodramas before but this one is overwhelmingly saddening and tragic. It is something of a landmark in that respect. Additionally perhaps in part because of its precedence in cinema the film somehow overcomes the flaws inherit in the tradition.Richard Barthelmess plays a Chinaman whose mission of teaching AngloSaxons the gentle ways of Buddhism is lost as he becomes a shopkeeper in misty Limehouse spending his days smoking opium and admiring an abused teenage girl Lillian Gish from afar. Griffith's adaptation certainly ennobles the yellow man in comparison to the more human portrayal which might be subject to accusations of racism towards an author in Thomas Burke's original story and there's much to contrast in this film with the conversely offensive racial representations in The Birth of a Nation as well. Gish's character is also sanitized. Much of the sex in the original story is lost as a result which might be as much because of Griffith's distaste of miscegenation than with his timidity to project such subject matter. Attraction towards or love for a virginal pubescent girl on the other hand is a reoccurring theme in his films. Nevertheless the subject matter I suppose remained rather provocative for its day.The story is centered on its characters and thus it's instrumental that the performances are great and Barthelmess and Gish are affecting. Gish is especially saddening and pathetic and even Donald Crisp does well enough and is appropriately terribly detestable. In the beginning yellow tinting helps convince viewers to accept the Caucasian Barthelmess as a yellow man. Although in one scene in particular his eyes are too open the deception is generally acceptable enough. Additionally some extreme closeups add greatly to the performances of the two leads.Everything in the film seems aimed towards creating mood including in addition to the acting the intertitles photography sets and tinting. The film turns very dark in its later parts in its melodrama tinting and lighting. Broken Blossoms takes place entirely within the confines of studio sets. They are well designed and create the atmosphere for the picture. Billy Bitzer's photography is brilliant in a similar vein. With the aid of Hendrik Sartov's softfocus visual effects Griffith and Bitzer sharpen blur and gloss over images and cast and lift shadows on command. The silhouette shots are also worth mentioning. This is a different style for Griffith and it's one of the best examples of the visual stylization mainstream American films were developing at the time and thereafter.The intertitles are often too corny and too plentiful and the melodrama seems ready at anytime to teeter over into annoying sentiment but the mastery of the filmmakers continue to keep it afloat. It is both familiar and new ground in cinema. I'm surprised how well this film works.".

	schema:reviewBody "After Birth of a Nation and Intolerance this is probably DW Griffith's third bestknown feature. This is perhaps in part because it conveniently counters the appalling racism of Birth with its positive of portrayal of mixedrace relationships and condemnation of xenophobia. It is also among his shorter features and therefore easier to digest than those earlier epics. Unfortunately though it is not of the same high calibre as his mid1910s successes.Although he had lead the way in the first half of the decade by this point Griffith had been overtaken by younger talent many of whom had been his students and his work was already looking increasingly oldfashioned. However Griffith had not lost his own talent and in its favour I will say Broken Blossoms has one of the most convincingly bleak portrayals of a setting in any film of this time. In the Spartan street scenes you can almost feel the cold and the sense of collective misery while the cluttered interiors perfectly evoke poverty and squalor. Here and there he even adopts the lowkey lighting patterns pioneered by Cecil B. DeMille. In contrast when required Griffith will hit us with an image of great beauty and delicacy such as his shot of Lillian Gish curled up on the shop floor. In this way he uses visual style to bring out the theme of the picture  rays of beauty amidst darkness and suffering.Where Broken Blossoms looks particularly dated however is in the acting style of the three leads. In contrast to the realism of the sets and many of the extras Gish Bathelmess and Crisp are nothing but hammy stereotypes grimacing and waving their arms about like the supporting cast of a Keystone comedy. These performances along with daft little devices such as Gish holding her smile up with her fingers completely rob the film of its dignity. In its defence it is possible Griffith had some method in encouraging such overacting  Gish's performance is toned down in her scenes with Bathlemess suggesting her character is only her natural self when she is with him. Crisp too is at his most exaggerated when his is with Gish as if his outbursts of anger towards her make him an animal. Still this isn't really enough to counter the three of them putting on a ridiculous pantomime show the rest of the time.As a side note it has been suggested that Griffith never used a pointofview shot in his entire career. In fact by 1919 they were fairly commonplace and while Griffith may have had trouble keeping up with the times there are a few of them in Broken Blossoms. When Bathelmess watches Gish from inside his shop we see her framed in the window as he sees her portrayed at her most beautiful and dignified. It is of great importance to the story that we experience his impression of her and it shows again that in spite of everything Griffith was willing and able to utilise uptodate cinematic technique.Broken Blossoms is no exception to the triedandtested formula of Griffith features and as can be expected finishes with a climactic ridetotherescue. The actual ride itself is a bit lacklustre here but Griffith instead concentrates on his other favourite suspense scenario  the sealed room. The device of a young woman trapped inside a room while some menacing man threatens her from outside goes back to Griffith's earliest shorts and the version here is one of his best. Rather than framing Gish in the usual threequarters shot in a fullsize room as he had done in many Biograph shorts Griffith instead squeezes her and the camera into a cramped cupboard involving the audience in the sense of claustrophobia. The only downside to this sequence is that Donald Crisp clearly doesn't know how to use an axe properly.On balance Broken Blossoms is not a terrible picture but it is certainly among Griffith's weaker features. Some might say that it has to be considered a product of its time but check out the sophistication of say DeMille's Male and Female or Chaplin's First National shorts of the same year and it's clear this is no valid defence. Broken Blossoms may have its moments but it's no masterpiece.".

	schema:headline " A heartbreaking oftenmisunderstood classic from D.W. Griffith";
	schema:reviewBody "There is no doubt that D.W. Griffith was the most influential American filmmaker of the 1910s his works literally changing the face of cinema forever. However given the era in which Griffith operated some of his most famous films now carry the burden of controversy most notably in terms of the director's often racial subject matter. For example Griffith's most famous film 1915's 'The Birth of a Nation' has long been both revered for its highlyinnovative filmmaking techniques and reviled for its controversial promotion of white supremacy and glorification of the Ku Klux Klan. Likewise his 'Broken Blossoms' has also been frowned upon as being racist  an unjust label I believe since the director has obviously aimed to be quite the opposite portraying the Chinese Cheng Huan as the most noble and sympathetic male character in the film.Cheng Huan played by American actor Richard Barthelmess is a devoted Buddhist who travels to London to spread the word of peace in the Western World. However his optimism quickly fades when he experiences the gritty and unforgiving streets of London. His one and only shining light in this grim smogridden world of cruelty and hate is Lucy Burrows Lillian Gish a truly painfully poignant image of vulnerability of a delicate flower in the breeze of the broken blossoms of a trodden rose. Physically abused by her father drunkard boxer Battling Burrows Donald Crisp young Lucy always feels unwanted and unloved the only smiles she can show are those that she has pushed into place with her own fingers. After watching after her for many months Cheng suddenly sees an opportunity to help his unfortunate  and forbidden  love even knowing that the repercussions will not be ideal.Though the film is obviously on a smallerscale than Griffith's previous works it is no less emotionallyinvolving. The director has constructed a truly stellar romance made all the more significant because it was among the first films to depict an interracial romance. The film does however require the viewer to suspend belief that an American actor is portraying a Chinese man understand that this was not in any way trying to make any racial statements. It was merely the most feasible approach for the era in which the film was made as I don't imagine that during the late 1910s it was customary  or even possible  for an Asian actor to have a starring role in a prominent Hollywood film. Adapted from Thomas Burke's unfortunatelynamed story 'The Chink and the Child' Griffith very much tried to clean up many of the racist portions of the story reenforcing Cheng Huan as the strongest character in the film. Though the subtitle of the film 'The Yellow Man and the Girl' today also sounds inherently offensive it is best observed merely as a product of the era and I also don't believe that Griffith meant anything evil by it.The acting in the film is quite effective though it varies between subtlety and exaggeration among the actors. Richard Barthelmess is very good in what must have been an awkward role and we watch painfully as he pines for the woman he loves knowing that he can never have her. Lillian Gish  who famously collaborated with the director on many an occasion  is a perfect picture of beauty and helplessness the controlled studio environments allowing Griffith to evoke a strong sense of intimacy. Donald Crisp is a complete caricature as Lucy's abusive father though strangely this performance somehow works very well. All in all D.W. Griffith's 'Broken Blossoms' is a touching and poignant early romance cementing the director's position as one of Hollywood's greatest early directors.".

	schema:headline " Griffith stars Gish and Barthelmess in tragic tale of operatic excesses...";
	schema:reviewBody "I have to preface my remarks by stating that BROKEN BLOSSOMS for all of its worth is suitable only for fans of silent films who can forgive all the excesses of silent melodrama.I'm not an aficionado of silent films but BROKEN BLOSSOMS is noteworthy for what Griffith was able to achieve on film as early as 1919. And surprisingly the most overthetop performance comes from an amazing character actor DONALD CRISP who went on to become an unforgettable player in talkies years later notably as the father in films like NATIONAL VELVET and LASSIE COME HOME. Crisp gives a wildeyed mouthtwisting performance that has him gnashing his teeth and looking like he's Mr. Hyde in his angry closeups.Here he's the meanest of the mean a father who abuses his daughter and then becomes fiercely protective when she dares to seek shelter elsewhere from a Chinese man who wants to spread the peaceful message of Buddha to AngloSaxons when he travels to the great nation across the sea.The scene shifts to the Limehouse district of London where his dreams are tested by the sordid realities of lifelike opium dens. Enter Battling Burrows DONALD CRISP as the gorillalike prizefighter who is the villain of the piece in full swaggering mode and chewing the scenery with relish. Forlorn looking and frail LILLIAN GISH wanders into the story at this point and we're told she's been badly treated by her brute of a father. Since she's treated no better than a doormat we can tell where the story is going.Naturally she ends up in a dead faint near the Chinaman's store and he takes her in giving her shelter warmth and kindness that she never had before. Truthfully Gish never manages to look like the fifteen year old girl she's supposed to be playing and her wan performance seems rather one note. Looking forlorn seemed to be her staple.As with most silent films the pacing is very slow and it's a good thirtyfive minutes before Gish and Barthelmess even meet and the story picks up more interest. And let me say that by today's standards the scenes of mistreatment in the house of suffering are ludicrous before Gish retreats to the streets and is taken in by Barthelmess.A tender moment in the film has a title card sure to provoke some chuckles when Gish says to Barthelmess What makes you so good to me Chinky? Closeups of Gish are not the most flattering as others here seem to think. Instead her tiny mouth and pinched face give her a look much older than her years that cannot be softened by soft focus photography. Barthelmess on the other hand has the looks and bearing of a romantic star even in his Oriental makeup and gives the film's most natural performanceat least until the last fifteen minutes. POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD  The melodramatic ending has Battling Burrows seeking revenge outraged that his daughter is living under the same roof with her Chinaman protector. Unfortunately the last fifteen minutes of the film reek of unabashed melodramatic excesses as the story delves into even darker territory with Gish's death at the hands of her abusive father and the Chinaman's eventual suicide after killing the brute.The excesses are so overthetop that you almost expect the characters to sing an operatic aria before dying.Summing up If you're a silent film fan you may find this one worth watching. Everyone else beware. It's not for every taste.".

	schema:headline " Griffith's Melancholy Masterpiece";
	schema:reviewBody "'Lyrical' is a wonderfully appropriate word to describe 'Broken Blossoms.' The picture is almost like a sonnet in its delicate perfection poignant almost to the point of melancholy with a running time that seems much much shorter than its actual eightynine minutes. This is one of Griffith's 'small' pictures unlike the superproductions such as 'Intolerance' or 'Orphans of the Storm' or even 'Way Down East.' Still it's difficult to believe that the intricate and detailed and richly authentic waterfront location was a set constructed to Griffith's specifications for the film.Like most other students of film history I have conflicted feelings about David Wark Griffith and his legacy of racism and intolerance as is plainly demonstrated in his watershed picture 'The Birth of a Nation.' But still I don't know that it's fair to ignore or deny or even question his ability to use the cinematic medium to create drama establish dramatic nuance and express emotion particularly in an art form which at the time was necessarily speechless.'Broken Blossoms' as a film was actually suggested to Griffith by Douglas Fairbanks who'd read the Thomas Burke source material the short story collection 'Limehouse Nights.' And according to actress Lillian Gish who like Richard Barthelmess gives probably her careerbest performance in this picture the film's release was delayed after production and principal photography was completed because Griffith was so emotionally devastated and drained by the filming experience that he couldn't face editing the picture. 'Broken Blossoms' eventually became the very first motion picture released by the new United Artists Corporation the elite production company formed in 1919 by cinematic superstars Griffith Mary Pickford Charlie Chaplin and Doug Fairbanks.Should you decide to see the picture try to find the 'Griffith Masterworks' version with the soulful Joseph Turrin music score which enhances and augments the sadness of the story. The film was popular enough at the time of its original release that a song entitled 'Broken Blossoms' was composed and recorded and became moderately popular. Turrin located a copy of the original sheet music of that lovely song and performs it on the piano in one of the 'Masterworks' extras.Those extras also include a filmed introduction by Lillian Gish and the entire text of the original Thomas Burke short story. And as an extra and unintentional bonus watch closely about twenty minutes into the picture right after the intertitle which reads The girl with the tearworn face The shot shows Gish looking into a store window and reflected in the window glass the viewer can see the ghostly image of photographer Billy Bitzer standing behind his tripod camera and then Griffith himself in a vest and shirtsleeves walking briskly onto the set and seating himself in a canvas chair beside Bitzer. The unintended action was a mistake and a production error and as such the moment violates the illusion and therefore distracts the viewer's attention momentarily from the drama but still it's a fascinating curio of motion picture history.'Broken Blossoms' is highly recommended. Far beyond a picture which will stay with you for a long time it's a picture you'll never forget...nor quite ever get over.".

The shop owner who comes to serve as a protector of the daughter is Buddhist in the movie and comes to America to teach Buddha's peaceful ways. What surprised me was that Chinese people were referred to as yellow or chinks. This would never been used in movies today unless pointing out the offensiveness of it.Different colors were used to tint the pictures. I noticed a sepia tone was mostly used for indoor shots while blue was used for outdoor daytime pictures. The music also contributed greatly to the emotions of the characters. This movie though did not seem believable to me. Maybe it was partially due to the fact that the actor playing a Chinese man was not infact Chinese or that the daughter did not look young enough to still be living at home or calling her father daddy. The plot could have used some more background information about the daughter and fathers life. What happened to the mother in the family? Also felt that the length of the first scenes in the movie were not necessary because the traditional Chinese culture did not play as a big of a part as the main story line.".

Broken Blossoms is not a movie that you will see me recommending to all my friends and family. The entire beginning of this movie left you hanging with not being able to understand what is happening and hard to understand. During the beginning of the movie there are different time flips such as something happens some amount of years ago then the present time making it a little bit confusing.Filmed in the early 1900's the editing of this movie were more then likely as high end as it can be. Broken Blossoms has different angle shots many scenes and a longer run time of 90 minutes. The only editing technique that I believe the film makers over used was the telescope focusing on people and activities. Instead of giving notes on what the actors are saying to one another the watchers are given poetic snippets of what is happening within the film making some scenes a little more difficult to understand. Lillian Gish and Richard Barthelmess the main actors in the film were not as talented as I would have hoped. A majority of them and other actors did not give the good affect of fear or love but their faces ended up looking distorted and corny.During the middle of the film when you are in better understand of what is going on you can imagine how the ending will turn out. All in all Broken Blossoms is a moderate film not intensely horrible to watch yet bearable. The ending wasn't one of a happy sense but one of gloom showing us that not all stories end in happiness like we would hope.".

Broken Blossoms came on and the four of us just sat there mouths hanging open just in awe of this movie the actors the atmosphere the story everything. I wouldn't have believed a silent film could be this powerful and moving but after seeing this I realised that we may have actually have lost something when sound was introduced. I can't recommend this movie highly enough. A few particulars  Liiliam Gish is stunning and evokes more feeling in a glance than most actresses do in an entire scene. The story line may seem dated in some regards  but the theme of love vs. hate in the particular forms of racism and child abuse is timeless. Not every single actor in this movie is up to Gish's standards. The father is at times clownish but that is partly a function of the state of the art at the time. To sum up if you haven't seen this movie you have been missing a great piece of movie as art. Don't let that situation continue any longer.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a very detailed description of the life of a French family.  It is a sweet story gently told.  It is about growing up expanding horizons the influence of friends and family members enjoying happy times together and reacting to life's inevitable problems.  In this film we recognise moments in our own lives.  The film has a universal theme.In a documentary style the older son Marcel relates how his father Joseph a schoolteacher takes up positions in various parts of France and how before schoolgoing age he sits at the back of the class and quickly learns how to read the text on the blackboard.  Family life seems to revolve around teaching and the classroom until Aunt Rose meets Jules on a park seat and eventually marries him.  After Jules joins the family circle father learns that there are more things in life than the educational system.When the family rents a villa in a wild part of Provence Jules instructs father on the use of the gun and they go on hunting sprees together.  On one of these expeditions the son gets lost and meets up with a local boy about his own age.  From him he learns about local birds the eagles the owls and scary stories about how these wild birds go for the eyes of their prey. This escape into the wild is a charming part of the family's life story and the final parting between the two boys when the family finally leaves is indeed moving.The story is sprinkled with amusing incidents.  For most boys the birth of a child is nothing short of a miracle.  They conjecture that the navel is a kind of button which can be unbuttoned to let the baby out.  And when father learns to shoot Jules attaches a target to the outside toilet door.  Father is delighted when he gets a bull's eye and Jules does well too. Not so the maid who happens to be inside the toilet at the time.  Fortunately she emerges shaken but unharmed.The film covers so much of French life.  It is amazing how much is packed in.  The story unfolds at an easy pace with beautiful music that never intrudes and scenery that astounds. I can recommend this little masterpiece about how wonderful family life can be.".

So it was one of his friends Yves Robert who undertook to make the coveted movie and the result turns out to be very convincing. Yves Robert's movie restitutes perfectly the atmosphere of Pagnol's book and he made a tender hearty movie lulled by Vladimir Cosma's nonchalant music where the shiny sun and sky of Provence reply to the wild beauty of the hills. These hills will make the little Marcel's enchantment. Thanks to a fluid making Robert films the happiness and the navety of childhood with a certain impishness. Besides Robert always enjoyed filming childhood like Truffaut and we particularly rediscover the quoted impishness in one of his movies la guerre des boutons. Robert introduces us the Pagnol's family and shows liking towards his characters. More than Marcel's character these are his feelings towards his family which Robert tries to define especially the pride towards his lucid and ambitious father excellent Philippe Caubre after his hunting achievement. Moreover he loves tenderly his mother but tends to despise his uncle. He blames him for being a liar and a conceited person. At the end a limpid movie that remembers with nostalgia of a past era. Pagnol would certainly have appreciated the result. If the movie introduces a bitter end it depicts the last picture as something symbolic  the glory of Marcel's father.".

	schema:reviewBody "My Father's Glory and its sequel My Mother's Castle tell the story of a young boy's wonder years growing up in a family with an adored father a lovely but frail mother and assorted eccentric relatives and friends. These are incredibly charming films that feature none of the violent action and highly charged emotions that we've come to expect in popular films today. Instead they celebrate the simple joys of life in a warm and loving family. When minor but unexpected events occasionally disrupt the daytoday flow of events they can seem like terrible disasters. On the other hand a simple visit to the country can seem like a tremendous adventure. It's not necessary to have seen My Father's Glory to enjoy My Mother's Castle. In fact I happened to see them out of order and I loved them just the same. But if I had my preference I'd watch them in order. The final scene of My Mother's Castle is emotionally powerful and satisfying for me it confirmed that every minute I'd invested in these films was worthwhile. I wanted to get up there on the screen and help. In French with English subtitles.".

To view life through Marcel's eyes is enchanting he is so easily spellbound by his surroundings so in love with the hills of his native Provence.The cinematography is absolutely breathtaking giving one the feeling of watching poetry in motion. The scene at the park on a Sunday afternoon is like watching a painting come to life. But cinematography is only a feather on the cap of this first rate production.

If you have not seen the Fanny trilogy or the single film by the same title starring Leslie Caron The Baker's Wife Harvest Manon of the Spring or any of his other films try to see them!! What makes all these films so wonderful is the superb writing and how his characters come to life. They are charming full of foibles and yet quite lovable! And this is definitely true in this movie as well.Despite the occasionally mundane plot you find yourself so wrapped up in their lives and caring for what happens to them.

I've spent a lot of holiday time in Provence when I was young and it's still true that the first time you meet those landscapes rocks up to the horizon with the vibration of warm air and everywhere the sound of crickets... It's like a desert yet it's full of life and everything you encounter turns to be a marvel. The movie makes you feel it with the diner late at night the peaceful and friendly ambiance... the deafening thunder rolling across the land while a real storm bursts in the sky... the old houses of rough stone the contrast with the activity of the city... everything's there and you can almost touch it. And not only can you feel the Provence but you also experience the evolution of the society of these times with the funny view of little Marcel I'll always remember the way he speaks of microorganisms how they'd just been discovered and how everyone started to fear them as if they hadn't existed until then !. I personally recommend that you see this movie and Le chteau de ma Mre in a theatre or with a good sound system to reproduce the ambiance of young Pagnol's life... this film is simple in its purpose but so rich in its details sets and views that you would feel frustrated with a bad sound!".

	schema:headline " Charming but longwinded remembrance of childhood in turn of the century France is not as good as the sequel";
	schema:reviewBody "My Father's Glory also known in French as La Gloire de mon pre is the first of a two part series of films based on famed playwright novelist and filmmaker Marcel Pagnol's childhood memoirs set in turn of the century France. The sequel My Mother's Castle is a continuation of the story of Marcel Pagnol's protagonist a young boy who grows up under the tutelage of his father Joseph a public school teacher in Marseilles. The story is narrated by an adult Marcel who comments on his own foibles along with his father a confirmed atheist who is always getting into heated discussions with Uncle Jules a feisty civil servant and religious Catholic who is initially seen courting and eventually marrying Marcel's Aunt Rose. Lost in the mix is Marcel's angelic mother Augustine a seamstress who has little to do in either film although she is slightly more prominent in the sequel. In addition to Marcel's younger brother Paul Marcel befriends a country boy Lili once the family begins making frequent pilgrimages up to their rented villa in the Provence countryside. Vincent Canby in the original NY Times review notes there are no harsh realities in Marcel's idyllic world Because it evokes a world from which all dread has been removed it passes beyond the sentimental into the realm of mythic happiness. It doesn't avoid or soften harsh realities they simply don't exist. While Canby is correct that My Father's Glory is lightweight this doesn't apply to the sequel which I would say is considerably darker than Act I.While charming My Father's Glory goes on for way too long. Simply put the sequences involving Joseph and Jules as they attempt to prove their prowess as hunters is a big bore. Scenes of Marcel's sojourn in the countryside with buddy Lili also could have been cut considerably. The film's stretched out climax when Marcel leaves a note for his parents that he plans to run away and then changes his mind suggests to me that director Robert could have taken the highlights from the first part and combined it with the more compelling sequel and ended up with a very nice 2  hour movie.If you have the patience to get through Part 1 you'll still be impressed by the charming characters all portrayed by a coterie of highly professional actors.".

	schema:reviewBody "My Father's Glory is about romanticism and memory a blunt low key comedy whereby one of the more residing moments of spoken humour arrives in the form of our narrator and lead talking about the pride and joy of his small rural French town which is a somewhat large chunk of raised land It's not tall enough to be a mountain... they explain in a locale dominated by mountains ...but it is no way just a hill. What's pleasing is that it doesn't fall into the traps that befall other comedies of a potentially romanticised nature this is one of those easy films that wraps you up in its tale of childhood and nostalgia  before you know it thirty minutes have gone by and you've been stuck in the same seated position glued to the screen without having given much thought to anything on account of how absorbing it's been.The lead is Marcel played as an infant by Julien Ciamaca but it is the voice of JeanPierre Darras as narrator who's on hand to guide us through this chapter in his boyhood from the stage of old age. The film unfolds in the 1900's following the tales of Marcel and his family of five his father Caubre a teacher named Joseph at a local primary school a respectable and respected man book smart who ends up being so good at his job that a better one lies away from the ruralised zone of nowhereinparticular where the kids are only as tuned in as they are and in the big city of Marseilles where the kids are more urban. For a film about times gone by and so heavily into looking back with a narrow eye a furrowed brow and a nostalgic toned voice it is amusing if that's even the right word to take note of what constituted as urban eighty years ago and what constituted as a bigger wider more intimidating city locale set away from your home pastures of the countryside. In the modern era the likes of Erin Gruwell would be schooling the roughandready future prison occupancies of this world in something like Freedom Writers.What comes with moving away to bigger and better things is the being in such close proximity to new people and places the film in actual fact a detailing of a holiday the family and some selected others experience out of term time and NOT a fishoutofwater story telling us about how this teacher applies his tried and tested methods on a group a little sharper and a tad less hospitable than before. No we are based inside rented accommodation in the dusty desertlike country side of Provence where these summer days are warm and long and where both the allure and brilliancy of the country side can have one fall in love with it away from the busy daytoday life of the city.Apart from everything being a fantastic adventure for this boy anyway the film resists the temptation to sugarcoat its content through measured depictions of people places and activities that are new perhaps even frightening but are never merely tossed up on screen as bland comedic ingredients around which some childish things can unfold. There is room for flaw even failure or fear of it in this exciting place and it is pleasing to watch a film tackling this sort of material without bouncing along at an unnatural rate depicting everything as hip and fun and faultless. In terms of capturing childhood indeed boyhood away from the main drag at a holiday destination that sees you occupy a fixed nonhotel imbued locale for a set number of weeks it's right on the button. Director Yves Robert does a great job in genuinely getting across that feeling that where one went how one learnt what one went through and what one thought of certain things and events has shaped elder Marcel. There are few live action comedies for kids and adults alike that depict kids and adults alike this is a rare triumph of a film documenting children taking centre stage and keeping up with how it is they think and feel about where they are and what's transpiring. There cannot be many who aren't able to get something out of this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Directed by Yves Robert in 1990 and adapted from Marcel Pagnol's classic autobiography My Father's Glory is a tale told from the perspective of an old man who looks at his childhood like we would probably do as we grow older tender nostalgia and profound affection. We all carry a strong emotional connection to our childhood and like a good French wine it only gets better as we get old.Yet instead of approaching it with a sort of introspective mindset Marcel starts relating to us a series of disjointed episodes and adventures of his life inviting us to connect them to our own childhood memories. In a way My Father's Glory resembles such endearing classics like Federico Fellini's Amarcord and Woody Allen's Radio Days two movies I adored. And like these two films there is no specific plot no antagonists and no unsettling or dangerous moments whatsoever. The film is as light as sweet as childhood memories can get. I expect some objecting voices stating that many people have darker visions of their childhood but again the film is narrated by a mature voice suggesting that it's an old person speaking... and as time goes by out instinct commands us to filter the best from our past.And what are left are our primal relationships with our family in general and parents in particular and the sights the scents the noises the sensual experiences that carried our first memories and this is My Father's Glory' a series of memories that can all speak to us and awake the Proust Madeleine's we restrained for so long. The richness of My Father's Glory the first opus before the sequel My Mother's Castle is to focus on the perceptions as well as the interactions and how finally they affect each other. Two persons count in Marcel's life his mother Augustine which is a sweet and innocent creature a woman with such a beauty we wonder if this is not a case of deification of the lost mother. And the father Jospeh the rational schoolteacher openly atheist who believes in education sciences and progress rather than any other sort of hazardous thoughts spiritualism or worse religion.The father's personality finds a perfect contrast with Uncle Jules the new husband of Augustine's sister Aunt Rose. Played by Didier Pain he's a big round and jovial man profoundly Catholic which makes his interactions and conflicts with the father more delightful as both form a joyous pair of Laurel and Hardy mirroring the opposition between an old and new order that were still cohabiting in France at the Eve of World War I. During the film we do by the way feel the specter of war but it only translates Marcel's childhood into an oasis of peace and harmony which is how we perceive our own childhood at the end. And if My Father's Glory doesn't intend to thrill us with plot twists or dangers it's to better guide us through the slow and peaceful passing of time and allowing the sensation of nothingness to be filled by the little episodes that enrich it and the colorful gallery of characters who populate it.Mainly set during the summer break in the country near Marseilles the film is about Marcel discovering his father in a total new setting among foreigners where his personality his knowledge and talents would be challenged by other people. Marcel's reactions reflect both his prides and fears the pride that his father is a man of a commanding presence and knows everything and the subsequent fear to see him humiliated by Uncle Jules who seems to know more about partridges and hunting. The vision of Marcel toward his father is the core of the story and it's powerfully conveyed by the cheerful poster where Marcel looks at his smiling father with proud eyes. Ironically the father's smile is almost childish so unlike the carapace he wears in his everyday life or with his pupils and that's because something changed in both the father and the son and all it took was an unforgettable hunting trip and the conclusion that gives all its meaning to its title. My Father's Glory is one of the best reflections of the relationship between a son and his father. It's not in believing that our father is a sort of superhuman but discover his normality and still be proud of him that's Marcel coming to knowledge.The film's main subplot is the growing friendship between Marcel and a boy from the countryside named Lili they meet during the hunting trip and grow rapidly fond of each other. Marcel likes Lili for his naturesmart while Lili is fascinated by the kidfromthecity. Deprived from any cynicism or conflict the genuine friendship is our compass to discover the country the landscapes the beautiful symbiosis between nature and elements. My Father's Glory' provides cinematic escapism at best with a succession of panoramic shots that work as the perfect homage to Marcel Pagnol's origins the South of France probably one of the most gifted places in the world challenging our senses we could smell lavender and rosemary or touch the leaves in the tree just as we could clearly hear the neverending sound of the grasshoppers and it's one sweet irony that Marcel's name is almost pronounced like Marseilles. And the friendship with Lili is an opportunity for us to plunge into this world to discover with amazement nature's majestic beauty and wish to have lived a childhood without TV programs videogames or toys to enjoy what was at our eyes but got unnoticed.There is a sort of purity of harmony transcending the plot elements in My Father's Glory we're literally transported from the beginning to the ending. Nothing happens much in the film but a lot does happen in our hearts as if Pagnol's memories were also part of ours aren't they after all?".

And if My Father's Glory doesn't intend to thrill us with plot twists or dangers it's to better guide us through the slow and peaceful passing of time and allowing the sensation of nothingness to be filled by the little episodes that enrich it and the colorful gallery of characters who populate it.Mainly set during the summer break in the country near Marseilles the film is about Marcel discovering his father in a total new setting among foreigners where his personality his knowledge and talents would be challenged by other people. Marcel's reactions reflect both his prides and fears the pride that his father is a man of a commanding presence and knows everything and the subsequent fear to see him humiliated by Uncle Jules who seems to know more about partridges and hunting. The vision of Marcel toward his father is the core of the story and it's powerfully conveyed by the cheerful poster where Marcel looks at his smiling father with proud eyes. Ironically the father's smile is almost childish so unlike the carapace he wears in his everyday life or with his pupils and that's because something changed in both the father and the son and all it took was an unforgettable hunting trip and the conclusion that gives all its meaning to its title. My Father's Glory is one of the best reflections of the relationship between a son and his father. It's not in believing that our father is a sort of superhuman but discover his normality and still be proud of him that's Marcel coming to knowledge.The film's main subplot is the growing friendship between Marcel and a boy from the countryside named Lili they meet during the hunting trip and grow rapidly fond of each other. Marcel likes Lili for his naturesmart while Lili is fascinated by the kidfromthecity. Deprived from any cynicism or conflict the genuine friendship is our compass to discover the country the landscapes the beautiful symbiosis between nature and elements. My Father's Glory' provides cinematic escapism at best with a succession of panoramic shots that work as the perfect homage to Marcel Pagnol's origins the South of France probably one of the most gifted places in the world challenging our senses we could smell lavender and rosemary or touch the leaves in the tree just as we could clearly hear the neverending sound of the grasshoppers and it's one sweet irony that Marcel's name is almost pronounced like Marseilles. And the friendship with Lili is an opportunity for us to plunge into this world to discover with amazement nature's majestic beauty and wish to have lived a childhood without TV programs videogames or toys to enjoy what was at our eyes but got unnoticed.There is a sort of purity of harmony transcending the plot elements in My Father's Glory we're literally transported from the beginning to the ending. Nothing happens much in the film but a lot does happen in our hearts as if Pagnol's memories were also part of ours aren't they after all?";

However this is actually a decent watchable though somewhat intense horror film.KOTS was one of the numerous nature on the rampage films that pardon the pun swarmed into theaters in the mid to late 1970s riding the successful crest of Steven Spielberg's Jaws.  It seems to draw inspiration not only from that film in that it is set in a small town that relies on a summer festival to survive but also The Birds an antagonistic romance between the two leads a small town turned into utter chaos and even Night of the Living Dead the main characters ultimately wind up barricading themselves in a house to survive the onslaught.The plot is typical Shatner plays a veterinarian in a small Arizona town who is baffled by the sudden death of a seemingly healthy calf.  When he asks for help from a university they send an entomologist played by Bolling who informs Shatner that the animal died from a massive dose of spider venom.  Sure enough an investigation uncovers a massive spider hill a kind of giant ant hill inhabited by hundreds of tarantulas in a local farmers' field and many others are discovered later.  Bolling theorizes that the normally solitary tarantulas have banded together to find food since farmers have killed their natural prey through overuse of insecticides.  The hairy little devils show they have also become quite intelligent as they carefully disrupt attempts to eradicate them and ultimately invade the town.Although the script is paperthin at times the special effects are welldone giving the viewer a genuine this could really happen! feeling. Not recommended for those who suffer from reallife arachnophobia but highly recommended for anyone looking for a good thriller.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let's be perfectly honest. Kingdom of the Spiders is not a blockbuster. But neither is it junk. It's where it needs to be  director John Bud Cardos aimed to make an interesting creepy film on the level of good and succeeded. It's not Arachnophobia which aimed high as a summer blockbuster and didn't meet its lofty goals. But if the American Film Institute AFI comes out with a list of the top nature goes wild films I'd rank Kingdom of the Spiders in the top 10 with Them Tarantula Jaws The Birds and Alligator. Of course when you think about it most of the nature goes wild films Empire of the Ants Grizzly Beaks Great White The Giant Spider Invasion etc. would actually rank among the worst films ever made.Kingdom of the Spiders was actually a madeforTV movie although a few fourletter words make it into the film. There's a brief glimpse of the underside of Tiffany Bolling's left breast which is tame compared to Melrose Place.It takes place in peaceful Verde Valley Arizona A great place to live in as a radio announcer says. Ironically the Arizona desert was also used for the 1955 classic Tarantula as well as the 2002 spider flick EightLegged Freaks. The soundtrack every song is by country singer Dorsey Burnette. This is his only claim to fame but the theme song will actually grow on you. Listen closely to the background music then rent a copy of Tarantula and you'll hear the same notes.William Shatner is actually a little more reserved here playing a vet named Rack Hanson. That's him actually taking a blood sample from a calf and he also corrals a steer so he can jab it in the butt with a real syringe that the steer didn't kick him where it counts shows how much confidence Shatner had in the scene. He is perplexed by a series of animal deaths especially the aforementioned calf owned by Walter Colby Woody Strode and Birch Colby Altovise Davis  Sammy's wife  in her movie debut. A sample sent to Arizona State University breaking another Hollywood cliche by using an actual college. The college sends Tiffany Bolling up to explain that the calf died from a massive dose of spider venom.From there we really get creepy. Hoke Howell  the John Carradine of the 70's 80's and 90's  as a garage owner gets bitten by a pesky tarantula which actually tries to chase him for another bite. Strode reveals a spider hill to Bolling and Shatner which is abnormal because tarantulas are loners. A later scene involves a prize bull crashing out of its stall whilecovered with tarantulas. It's so sudden it will make just about anyone jump.It seems the tarantulas have gotten a little ped that overuse of pesticides has killed off their normal food supply. They decide to band together to fight back. After taking care of the domestic animal population they turn on Man.The movie has many aspects similar to Jaws. Verde Valley is a small town dependent on its county fair for its life. It even has a jackass of a mayor who doesn't want the fair tarnished. It features an enemy that is made to appear intelligent. And it has a recognizable cast of veterans that acts well enough to let the monsters be the real stars of the film.The really creepy aspect of the film is the enemy. There are no real special effects. The scene where spiders get inside a plane that's about to bomb them with DDT is predictable but the real beauty is seeing the tarantulas crawling all over the pilot's head and face. When the plane crashes into Howell's garage that's all real stunt work. Another creepy scene involves the local sheriff telling a woman that her husband's been killed by tarantulas. As he does it nearby atop a fence sits a tarantula. When the woman bursts out crying the tarantulas turns and slowly crawls away as if it was actually paying attention to the whole scene. I won't try to give away too much but other creepy bits include a child on a swing just inches above a horde of tarantulas that seem to leap up to get at her. More tarantulas are inside a speeding truck. Still others get the jump on Shatner who should get points for having them crawl all over his face!The ending is really the kicker. Shatner Bolling and a few others hole up in a lodge as thousands of spiders try to get in  through open windows through the air vents through the kitchen stove vents through the fireplace even through the windows by weighing down the glass with their bodies. Meanwhile in town we see the panicked population running around screaming covered with tarantulas. I personally believe the screams were real since the spiders were real though defanged. We see cocooned bodies everywhere. The spiders are all over the road inside buildings and cars just everywhere. Worst of all is that Tiffany Bolling discovers that foam fire extinguishers kill the spiders by coating their booklike lungs but we viewers know there's not enough foam in Arizona to stop this invasion. It seems to only be delaying the inevitable.A word to the wise. There is a painting shown at the end of the film and it does look cheesy now. But the concept it implies is what matters and that makes for one of the strangest and creepiest movie endings of all time.Overall the movie is good. It aims high but not too high and it succeeds. It has a few flaws noticeably why Shatner and company don't leap into a nearby RV and get the hell out of Dodge instead of waiting around for the sheriff to come back but they're not too bad. Shatner Bolling and Strode acquit themselves well amazing for Shatner too. Even the potential cliches are dispelled. In one scene Bolling takes a shower and we see a tarantula crawl up and into her dresser drawer. She comes out of the shadows sits down at the dresser and reaches into the drawer. Instead of screaming she gently picks up the tarantula pets it and takes it back outside lucky tarantula. Another scene does away with Shatner's leading man role as he only gets a brief kiss with Bolling before the tarantulas turn his life into a living hell. His character panics just as badly as the rest of the cast and he even has to get his butt saved.On a side note the SPCA would go mad now but all the spiders in the movie were real. They used 10000 live tarantulas ! for the movie. Even the ones that get coated with foam get stomped get run over by tires are real. All the ones one the people are real. Reportedly the extras were paid double wages because they had to have spiders crawl all over them. Even the pilot of the plane that crashes had spiders on him and he had to resist the urge to just jump up and pull them off his face. The producers had to drug the calf and later the prize bull so they wouldn't freak at having spiders all over them and so they would collapse as if affected by the spider venom.Also George Lucas and Steven Spielberg were supposedly inspired by this movie and added that opening scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark where Indiana Jones and his companion go into the cave and get covered by tarantulas.All in all it's an very good film. I've watched it many times and I still sometimes get bugged out no pun intended when I fall asleep afterwards and feel a breeze across my body.Rent or buy it but just get it. Just don't try to compare it to Arachnophobia or try to make it into a classic. It's just a fun and creepy movie.".

Good because they didn't need a great motivation to act scared and bad ... because some actually must have been genuinely scared!Having said that the movie does not have a big budget I even read this might have been initially made for TV although I'm not sure if that's true and the dialog is off quite a few times.

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie when I was about 12 years old having already been traumatized by the tarantula horrors of Arachnophobia a few years earlier. Not only did it make my arachnophobia much worse it was my favorite movie for several years!Kingdom of the Spiders was one of the first horror movies to feature normal everyday spiders as villains earlier films such as Tarantula and Earth vs. the Spider has made the arachnids giant in order to scare an audience. As far as my memory serves me the only other movie prior to this that used normalsized spiders as villains was Kiss of the Tarantula! The cast of Kingdom is sort of a potpourri of 70s drivein movie names Tiffany Bolling of Wicked Wicked and The Candy Snatchers William Shatner of countless lowgrade Bmovies and Star Trek Lieux Dressler of Truck Stop Women Woody Strode of Black Jesus and Altovise Davis Sammy Davis Jr.'s wife who attempted a movie career. The cast is fabulous and is for the most part above average for this kind of movie. A noticeable face in the crowd is Adele Malis as the sweet older lady on vacation with her husband in peaceful Verde Valley. She is funny and lovable and creates great sympathy from the audience! I love her! The music is a mix of Dorsey Burnette country songs the best of which is the title song Peaceful Verde Valley and music stolen from THE TWILIGHT ZONE episode To Serve Man!Now for the main reason anyone would see this movie the spiders. They are horrifying! The first appearance of one is when a mechanic feels inside a tire in a shack to see if it's full and is bitten by a hidden tarantula! It's quite a shock and is one of many. They are everywhere! I would dare to say that Kingdom of the Spiders is equal to if not better than its latterday companion Arachnophobia. Both deliver the goods to their audiences you will be looking under chairs and between blankets weeks after seeing this movie! the only difference being the budget and the professional cast of Arachnophobia.Kingdom of the Spiders isn't too hard to find and if you do find it to rent or buy do so! There are too many great scare scenes not to be missed and an ending that socks quite a punch! The obvious warnings are given to those with SEVERE arachnophobia and those would like to get some sleep after watching this movie.".

The spiders are just furious at humans and eat them...period! Although very lowbudgeted some sequences are wellmounted and quite suspenseful. Especially the obligatory masshysteria scene in which the poor villagers get overrun by millions and millions of tarantulas is a fine example of trashcinema. Director John Bud Cardos previously an actor is dreadful drivein horror movies himself clearly had great fun making this good oldfashioned Don'tmesswithMotherNature flick so why shouldn't you!

It's solidly acted by a sturdy cast led by the almighty William Shatner. It builds to one hell of an intense Night of the Living Dead style climax intercut with catastrophic scenes in the local town that makes one wonder how the characters can possibly hope to prevail. The onslaught of ferocious tarantulas is aweinspiring.The Shat at his charismatic best plays Rack Hansen amiable small town veterinarian who calls in big city entomologist Diane Ashley 70s B movie hottie Tiffany Bolling when faced with the death of rancher Walter Colby's Woody Strode prize calf. She realizes that the cause of death was injection of spider venom. Soon scores of tarantulas swarm through the desert attacking humans and other larger life forms basically because the over use of DDT has eliminated the arachnids' normal food supply.Shatner Bolling and the always excellent Strode are well supported by Lieux Dressler David McLean Natasha Ryan Altovise Davis Marcy Lafferty Shatners' thenwife playing his sister inlaw Roy Engel and Hoke Howell. The movie is nicely photographed by John Arthur Morrill on picturesque Arizona desert locations. The images of numerous extras covered with tarantulas  and webbing as well  is pretty chilling. There's a touch of Jaws in the screenplay by Richard Robinson and Alan Caillou in that the local mayor Engel doesn't want anything to hurt the success of the county fair going on. And the implications of that final shot are spooky.A very fine movie of its type.Eight out of 10.".

Instead it's an open end an an appeal against the abuse of pesticides. Big bonus. And the tarantulas are soooooo yucky. I even think this movie is the cause for my brothers aracnophobia. One thing that upsets me in almost every of this kind of movies is that the hero in this case Captain Kirk saves a child.

You won't find a 'dumb' moment in the dialog either. At least I didn't.The story builds up slowly yet surely. In fact it all builds to the 2nd half of the movie. That's when all breaks loose.And with all I mean the hundreds and hundreds of spiders. REAL spiders. That's right they used real spiders for this movie. No CGI no puppets no plastic.That fact alone makes this movie very effective. If you are afraid of spiders then this ain't a movie for you. If you can handle some creepiness then you will get a kick out of this movie.I got goosebumps from watching this. There are some very welldirected scenes. Time and time again I asked myself how the actors could possibly work with real spiders. Tarantulas are as I remember correctly not aggressive by nature though. People get covered in spiders. Spiders drop from ceilings pipes windows trees. They hide in shoes climb on beds and even hide in cars. In this movie they are literally EVERYWHERE.This movie proves that you don't need fancy effects to make a great film. I recommend this to anyone who likes 'nature attacks' movies.".

Also I remember as a whole it freaked me completely out.Sure I had and still have arachnophobia so since most horror movies especially the haunted houseghost stories of late don't scare me I'll always turn to these Eight Legged Freaks for example no matter how preposterous just to get a little or a lot frightened. The producerswritersdirectors aren't stupid they know what audience ME would be freaked out.Yes Kingdom of the Spiders is an absolute Bmovie but honestly it wasn't all that bad. Of course we're given the typical corny explanation insecticides have killed off all of the tarantulas normal meals so they've mutated tolerated each other which apparently they're quite antisocial and now are moving on to larger prey. To me a nonscientistbiologistspiderdoctor that doesn't really make much sense all prey is gone so the population multiples a thousand fold? Get past that and the fairly slow opening hour with Shatner doing his typical womanizing and you're in for a treat. I can see what scared me as a kid when they finally revealed the little killers in masses.Picture it Camp Verde AZ. Small in this movie pintsize western town. A prize cow dies somehow and owner is worried just about being quarantined by the town's vet doctor Shatner. In comes a potential love interest all the way from Tempe in reality it would take probably 23 hours max to make the trip but they make it seem like it's a trek yeah I had to toss a Shatnerterm in from NYC. She's concerned about the 5x lethal venom from spiders.Throw in some antipesticide speeches and more animals die. I guess the tarantulas were too timid for humans or they simply ran out of animals as they started with the livestockpets first. Soon the people are attacked and like all of the WhenAnimalsAttack films a group of diverse survivors hold up in a cabin to wait out the onslaught.Now I've been to Camp Verde not in 1977 per se. I actually arrived in AZ in 1981 but nevertheless I've visited it and it didn't look anything like the movie's version. In fact I recall in the early 80s that they had actual working phones not 1920 phone props. Nevertheless this obvious JawsThe Birdsripoff does have its effectiveness. And a seriously disturbing openended finale. I loved the final shot.Not for everyone Kingdom of the Spiders is still recommended for those wanting a BMovie scare out of those eight legged freaks. In reality it's a helluva lot better than most spiderambush movies made since.Side Note I love the StolenStar Wars poster's tagline above a tortured man with a torch A Wild Science Fiction Nightmare. Let's dissect all that. It doesn't take place in space nor is there any real war the humans were no match for the tarantulas. No one had a torch though someone seriously tries to get away by shooting a gun. It's never really wild  if you see the town the wildest thing that could happen some actually driving from Colorado for their annual fair. Science Fiction? OK that one is where someone should draw the line and actually sue for false advertising though George Lucas probably was prepped for the look of the poster. And finally nightmare. OK that one I would agree. You get even one of the 50000 tarantulas used on meFreddy would have enough ammo for my next three nightmares.".

Soon the people are attacked and like all of the WhenAnimalsAttack films a group of diverse survivors hold up in a cabin to wait out the onslaught.Now I've been to Camp Verde not in 1977 per se. I actually arrived in AZ in 1981 but nevertheless I've visited it and it didn't look anything like the movie's version. In fact I recall in the early 80s that they had actual working phones not 1920 phone props. Nevertheless this obvious JawsThe Birdsripoff does have its effectiveness. And a seriously disturbing openended finale. I loved the final shot.Not for everyone Kingdom of the Spiders is still recommended for those wanting a BMovie scare out of those eight legged freaks. In reality it's a helluva lot better than most spiderambush movies made since.Side Note I love the StolenStar Wars poster's tagline above a tortured man with a torch A Wild Science Fiction Nightmare. Let's dissect all that. It doesn't take place in space nor is there any real war the humans were no match for the tarantulas. No one had a torch though someone seriously tries to get away by shooting a gun. It's never really wild  if you see the town the wildest thing that could happen some actually driving from Colorado for their annual fair. Science Fiction? OK that one is where someone should draw the line and actually sue for false advertising though George Lucas probably was prepped for the look of the poster. And finally nightmare. OK that one I would agree. You get even one of the 50000 tarantulas used on meFreddy would have enough ammo for my next three nightmares.";

Yep somebody borrowed about 5000 tarantulas to make this movie and the effect is one of the most realistic man vs. beast movies out there. KINGDOM OF THE SPIDERS is all you could hope for in a Bmovie starring everyone's favourite thesp William Shatner and a cast of Bmovie hopefuls.The plot concerns spiders which have to turn to larger food suppliers after farmers using DDT destroy most of their natural insect food. It has NOTHING to do with alien spiders as the UK box cover bizarrely suggests. Although the film's structure adheres to the old strict template minor deaths and mysteries followed up by a fullscale invasion cult director John Bud Cardos who also gave us THE DARK and MUTANT takes time out for us to get to know  and care for  the principal characters involved in the antics. William Shatner takes the leading hero's role of a cowboy veterinarian ! and his acting is pretty subdued here  at least until the finale in which he is attacked by spiders and goes into a fit of overacting or a scene where he skips down a road covered with the creepycrawlies! Tiffany Bolling is the hardheaded female scientist who comes to investigate the mysterious deaths of cows shown at the beginning in good eerie scenes and whose heart is soon melted by Shatner's charms. The only other actor of note is Woody Strode who here puts in a touching show as a farmer who fears that his farm is going to get quarantined. The rest is your typical Bmovie bunch and fans will be glad to hear that there's a high death toll with literally dozens of folk falling victim to the invading arachnids.Although as with most nature's rampage horror flicks from the past twenty years there's a certain suspension of disbelief required to enjoy the on screen action KINGDOM OF THE SPIDERS offers us some truly great shocks and scares to rouse us from the inaction of the first half. There's a great shot of a spidercovered bull jumping suddenly at the camera which is guaranteed to put anybody on the edge of the seat and a frightening moment in which a pilot is attacked by spiders and crashes his plane into a building which explodes. However the best part of the film is the last twenty minutes the fullscale invasion which owes more than a nod to NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD as the survivors board themselves up inside a roadside caf and sit it out.There are many scenes of people being surrounded bycovered in spiders which work because these are real moving spiders not lousy special effects. The film briefly moves to the town where there's some largescale chaos with cocooned bodies all over and people crashing their cars into watertowers which then collapses and kills yet more folk. Shatner himself has a suspenseful scene in the basement where he goes to fix a fuse and finds himself covered in the creepy crawlies and struggles for survival. This is classic stuff and a cut above the usual lessthanimpressive invasion sequences in similar movies. The film ends with an ambiguous sadly unconvincing matte shot showing the entire town has been cocooned in a spider's web and manages to be sufficiently eerie. KINGDOM OF THE SPIDERS is a treat of a Bmovie for genre fans and one of the more effective managainstnature flicks out there.".

	schema:headline " Rampaging spiders in a seventies trash classic!";
	schema:reviewBody "Spiders are very much one of the 'horror animals' and Kingdom of the Spiders is clearly one of the best films to be based around them! Many people seem to have a phobia of spiders  personally I love them but I can certainly see why a lot of people find them creepy. This film makes best use of that fact as while the spiders aren't monstrously oversized there is a lot of them  and it soon becomes clear how being overrun by spiders could lead to a very frightening situation! One of the things I liked best about this movie was the fact that it uses actual tarantulas! Many films featuring spiders use crappy looking fake ones or in the case of more modern films  CGI and it never works very well. The story is simple as you would expect and focuses on a small country town. Cattle are dying mysteriously and when a good looking female entomologist turns up she quickly deduces that spiders are the problem. They're migrating in huge numbers after the loss of their food source and this making them aggressive...The film benefits from a nice country atmosphere and to go along with this we get a nice cheesy country soundtrack! William Shatner is the main star and he delivers a nice performance which fits in with the tone of the movie. My main gripe with the film is the fact that not a great deal happens for the first hour. Don't get me wrong this film is never actually boring but it does feel like the spiders aren't posing all that much of a threat for a lot of the film. Kingdom of the Spiders takes obvious influence from classic creature features such as The Birds in that it puts its focus on a small group of people amidst nature's attack. The characters really aren't all that interesting but the spiders are the star of the show so the characters themselves aren't all that important. The death scenes tend to be quite samey but still they're effective and the film does manage a handful of really suspenseful and somewhat harrowing scenes. The film is obviously pure trash throughout but its enjoyable pure trash and I have to see that this is one of the best films of its type that I've seen.".

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw this movie at least 10 years ago.  I remember telling my 6th grade class when we studied spiders all about it.  The universal reply of teachers and friends that movie is called Arachnophobia... there is nothing about a Kingdom of Spiders in the title. 10 Years later i can finally look past the emotional trauma caused by that denouncing of my claim that there was indeed another movie and laugh at them HAHAHAHAHAHAHA! In any case... this movie unlike Arachnophobia is solely responsible for my fear of spiders.  I remember finding a roll of duct tape after watching this film and sealing myself in my bedroom. Every crack filled every window blocked then taped over i was absolutely sure the spiders were coming for me.  The ending of the film resonates with me especially in a way that Arachnophobia never could.  Leave it to a B movie to shy away from the neat little packaged Hollywood ending so popular today. BRAVA Kingdom of the Spiders! I give it an 8 out of 10 on the giving Tricia issues scale.".

He is just fantastic in this.I'm watching it thinking is he going to have the bottle to let one of these freaky spiders crawl on him and then all of a sudden hes on screen with them crawling all over his face! Respect! Other than his hair being really wierd his acting is just fantastic. One bit in particular stands out where he has just been bitten by a spider on the face and he stumbles up to the camera and deliberatley shoves his wound into the camera as if it was supposed to be in 3D!The scene where the plane crashes into the barn looks really impressive and contains music that was used in the Australian soap opera Prisoner Cell Block H. And the closing painting looks hokey but the idea behind it is really creepy.This is as a top class BMovie with some suspenseful direction and impressive production values. But the star of the show is most definatley William Shatner. Lovin it!".

Other than his Star Trek films Shatner's career in movies is bizarrewith some fine performances such as in INCUBUS and THE TENTH LEVEL and some overthetop awful performances as well such as in WHITE COMANCHE and my favorite of his bad films IMPULSE. I like to watch and see just what sort of Shatner I'll seefor good or for bad. Well despite the cheesy title and theme of KINGDOM OF THE SPIDERS this isn't a bad performance for the Shat. This is NOT saying that it's a particularly good filmbut his performance and character were not the reason the film didn't win an Oscar!! While Shatner's acting is just fine it is odd however to see him wearing a cowboy hat and living in a town surrounded by desert scrub! He just doesn't seem like the sort of fella to be living in Arizona.The most annoying things about the film are not the spiders but a character named Diane Ashley. She is like a walking clich but a very very inconsistent and stupid clich. Like so many of the heroines of the 70s and 80s this one is full of spunk...and I hate spunk to quote Lou Grant. She is smart tough cool and incredibly nasty towards menand living up to the stupid stereotype that any woman who is successful MUST be a complete and total....well you know what I'm trying to say but can't say here on IMDb! This is a very annoying character and what makes her worse is that after spending so much time being just plain nasty towards Shatner she all of the sudden falls completely under his spell! In other words one minute she's like ice and the next she's practically massaging his tonsils with her tongue!! This must have set feminism back at least a decade and made me laugh since she was nothing but a string of clichs all pieced together to make up her character.As for the film itself the story is about a whole lotta nasty tarantulas that somehow become bloodthirsty killerswhich is weird since tarantulas are basically big but harmless. Shatner is a vet who investigates the deaths of some livestock due to the spiders and Tiffany Bolling plays Ashleyan entomologist with a split personality! Somehow the spiders have begun to swarm tarantulas are NOT sociable in real life and are loners and their natural venom is now five times stronger than normalmaking them even more dangerous than bunnies NIGHT OF THE LEPUS or ants EMPIRE OF THE ANTS or frogs FROGS!!!While this isn't a completely terrible film because it is a bit silly and there are countless similar films many more than are listed above it's quite unnecessary for anyone other than devoted Shatner fans to watch the film. It's not quite campy enough to recommend it nor is it interesting enough to set it apart from the crowd. However you might laugh at a few of the scenes such as the crop duster incident as well as the scene where the lady shoots the spider off her hand! My favorite though was the entire last 15 minutes of the film where it all became a giant insane freeforalllike the end of ANIMAL HOUSE. No one even thought to just get in their cars and leave town but chose instead to run about screaming as the smart spiders killed them off onebyone. Overall a silly trifle that obviously didn't seriously harm Shatner's career...though you never have heard about Tiffany Bolling since this film have you?!By the way an awful lot of tarantulas are stomped on and smooshed in the movie. That seems pretty sad and a waste. Where is the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Arachnids when you need them?!".

This also makes the panic scene later in the film where people run back and forth screaming as the spiders crawl around slowly more laughable than frightening. Of course the spiders move much faster offscreen than on so maybe that explains it.And let's not even go into the scene with Altovise Davis and the revolver.The ending which I remembered as being genuinely shocking and disturbing is in fact ludicrous and makes no sense at all. And the score is overblown and outofplace and features one of the worst country songs I have ever heard and I don't like country music anyway.On the plus side it does have William Shatner at his studlycheesiest. And to be fair the couple who start out looking like the typical Annoying Moronic Tourists turn out to be fairly intelligent and useful.But that's not enough to save it.

Speaking of that watch his hand as he opens the bedroom door and discovers his wife's lifeless body. There are plenty of comic relief characters with names like Ziggie and Kitty and even a droning switchboard operator with a recurring part.The Hays code obviously hadn't completely kicked in yet because there is dialog here that is racier than films of the later 30s such as fairly open discussions about illegitimacy.

Aline MacMahon also deserves praise. This was her first film and she was perfect in the role of Miss Taylor  Randall's conscience. Yes she soon started to play kindly aunts and best friends but she was vital to any film that she was in and in this film next to Robinson she is the highlight. Adorable Marian Marsh who had just had a hit as Trilby in Svengali went on to star in several hits of the early 30s. In this film she plays the daughter Jenny Townsend and her high light is the end  Why did you kill my Mother????Joseph W. Randall Edward G. Robinson is managing editor of the Evening Gazette the biggest scandal rag in the city. He is determined to make the paper more respectable and because of that the circulation is down. you are trying to get above our readers... Say if I sat on a cigar box I'd be above them!!!. The paper's owner the sultan of slop decides to resurrect a 20 year old murder case where a young woman Nancy Voorhees killed her boss. She stood trial but was let off because of her baby. The paper wants to know what became of her. She is now married to a bank manger H.B. Warner who loves her dearly and stood by her. Her daughter Jenny is about to be married to Phillip Anthony Bushell whose parents are in high society.Boris Karloff is really creepy as Isopod a defrocked priest  don't drive in taxis with him!!! He poses as a priest interviewing the parents of the bride  in reality trying to get a scoop for the paper. Jenny's parents confide in him thinking he really is a priest and of course Isopod takes it to the papers.The story makes front page news on the day of the wedding. Phillip's parent visit and command that the wedding be called off. Nancy the mother calls the paper and by the use of a triple screen you see how her pleas go unanswered by everyone except Miss Taylor. Her husband goes to see a friend who says he will do all in his power to stop the story but it is too late for Nancy who has taken her own life.Why did you kill my mother!!!!. Even though Phillip has stood by her Jenny is distraught and goes to Randall's office planning to kill him. After a huge show down that will leave you emotionally breathless a glass door is broken and Randall goes off with Miss Taylor  if you want my opinion  take me to a speakeasy some night  I won't be working for you then!!!  to start a clean life away from the gutter of the scandal rag that has more huddles on this paper than on the Notre Dame team!!!!The door that was broken was the door to the owner's office  not the door out of the office.Highly recommended.".

	schema:headline " Deadlier Than The Tommy Gun";
	schema:reviewBody "Five Star Final according to Edward G. Robinson in his memoirs was a favorite role for him. He enjoyed having to go through a film without once taking up a weapon. But Robinson did have a weapon at his disposal here one deadlier than the tommy gun. The power of yellow journalism to ruin and destroy lives for the sake of circulation. Circulation is down at the New York Graphic the sleazy tabloid where Robinson is the hardboiled editor. Publisher Oscar Apfel decides to rake over a 20 year old murder one of those where are they now pieces. A woman killed a man who got her pregnant and refused to marry her and another man stepped up to the plate and raised her baby girl as his own. The couple H.B. Warner and Frances Starr have lived quietly and anonymously on the west side of Manhattan the daughter Marian Marsh is about to marry Anthony Bushell the son of a manufacturer.The poking and prying of Robinson's reporters results in tragedy. It also gives Robinson a severe attack of conscience encouraged by his girl Friday Aline McMahon.Stealing the film in the small part he's in is Boris Karloff as disgraced seminarian who affects the guise of clergyman to get the story he's after. It's one of Karloff's best nonhorror film roles he's positively creepy in the part.The reason for Karloff's disgrace is sexual one and getting Karloff's mojo going as well is Ona Munson who also has a great part as the Nellie Bly of the tabloids.

	onyx:emotionText "Five Star Final according to Edward G. Robinson in his memoirs was a favorite role for him. He enjoyed having to go through a film without once taking up a weapon. But Robinson did have a weapon at his disposal here one deadlier than the tommy gun. The power of yellow journalism to ruin and destroy lives for the sake of circulation. Circulation is down at the New York Graphic the sleazy tabloid where Robinson is the hardboiled editor. Publisher Oscar Apfel decides to rake over a 20 year old murder one of those where are they now pieces. A woman killed a man who got her pregnant and refused to marry her and another man stepped up to the plate and raised her baby girl as his own. The couple H.B. Warner and Frances Starr have lived quietly and anonymously on the west side of Manhattan the daughter Marian Marsh is about to marry Anthony Bushell the son of a manufacturer.The poking and prying of Robinson's reporters results in tragedy. It also gives Robinson a severe attack of conscience encouraged by his girl Friday Aline McMahon.Stealing the film in the small part he's in is Boris Karloff as disgraced seminarian who affects the guise of clergyman to get the story he's after. It's one of Karloff's best nonhorror film roles he's positively creepy in the part.The reason for Karloff's disgrace is sexual one and getting Karloff's mojo going as well is Ona Munson who also has a great part as the Nellie Bly of the tabloids. She tops Karloff in what she'll do for a story.Five Star Final is a hard hitting well acted drama that does tend to go a bit overboard into melodrama especially when H.B.

	schema:reviewBody "As a former jackal of the press myself I get a big kick out of newspaper movies. FIVE STAR FINAL is one of the best ranking alongside THE FRONT PAGE and its various remakes CITIZEN KANE MEET JOHN DOE the littleknown DEADLINE U.S.A. with Bogart as a crusading editor ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN and ABSENCE OF MALICE. I'm probably leaving out a couple of other favorites but those are the ones that come to mind at this writing. This film has three things going for it. The story based on a play that opened in 1930 was probably more relevant in that era than today. Most news outlets excluding those that are exclusively on the internet now are more respectful of the privacy of private citizens than are the employees of the Evening Gazette and I've never known a reporter or photographer who lied about being one to get a story. But an intimate followup on the crime committed twenty years earlier by Nancy Voorhees  and for which she was not convicted  was the type of sensational breadandbutter that certain sleazy newspapers pursued before World War II. Today's sleazy tabloids print and electronic are far more likely to go after real celebrities who hunger for any kind of publicity. And many socalled internet journalists without training editing or professional standards are much worse. Though this kind of yellow journalism is an aberration in today's newspaper industry in 1930 it was all too prevalent especially in the cutthroat world of New York City's intensely competitive dailies. It's very representative of the era and on top of that it's just a good yarn.The supporting actors are extremely wellcast. Aline MacMahon as the editor's lovelorn secretary George E. Stone as the paper's staff bootlegger and fixer H.B. Warner as the understanding husband of Nancy Voorhees and Oscar Apfel as the villainous publisher Hinchcliffe are particular standouts. It's interesting to see Boris Karloff in a preFRANKENSTEIN role though it's difficult to think of him as a womanizing reporter. Some may find the acting in the film too stagy and overdone but if you can adjust your expectations and accept the dated style it works very well.Then there's Eddie G. He had just achieved stardom with LITTLE CAESAR when FIVE STAR FINAL was made and despite the excellent competition he commands the screen as the Gazette's editor who is both repelled by the betrayal of his journalistic ideals and excited by the repellent story he's ordered to pursue. The handwashing which actually occurs only about three times in this 90minute movie is a perfect metaphor for his guilt and his reliance on the bottle was maybe still is all too common an occupational hazard for newspapermen of this era. At film's end we finally get the emotional explosion that has been building in Robinson throughout the movie. Very satisfying. What a shame this actor never received even an Oscar nomination much less a statuette except for an honorary one awarded after his death.FIVE STAR FINAL was nominated for the best picture Oscar in 1931 but lost out to CIMARRON. Guess which film has aged less. Despite the dated setting and story FIVE STAR FINAL still crackles with passion and humor. It is an enduring example of what Warner Brothers accomplished altogether unintentionally in documenting America in the 1930s. I can understand that it's not to all tastes but this jackal of the press finds in FIVE STAR FINAL characters and issues that still resonate with journalists today.".

	schema:reviewBody "Five Star Final 1931There is one main reason to watch thisEdward G. Robinson. I almost didn't continue after the first fifteen minutes because this newspaper office drama was so filled with convenient stereotypes and oneliners it was drab.Then came the obsessivecompulsive reporter played by Robinson Mr. Randall. He's intense and he's not in the movie nearly enough. There is a wonderful quirky part by Boris Karloff a few months before doing Frankenstein's monster. And a slew of decent smaller parts keep it interesting like Aline MacMahon playing a stenographer and in her first film role and Marian Marsh who plays the daughter with increasing intensity right up to the highly volatile last scene.This is the heyday of the unsung Mervyn LeRoy a director with at least two unsurpassed movies Three on a Match and I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang not including his work on Wizard of Oz. He has a dozen other really good films to his name and this one survives despite some filler and a slightly functional approach to the acting and staging. This was the day when directors and their crews were pressed to shoot movies in a couple weeks or so and it shows.I only wish you could see the second half of this movie alone. It gets more dramatic and more intense and the one painfully wooden actress dies and it really drives home the point against yellow abusive journalism. The first half is stale enough to turn off a lot of viewers I'm sure and it brings down my overall impression of the totality. Luckily if you make it to the end you nearly forget the forgettable beginning and will leave with a good taste in your mouth.And all the drinking in the movie? God gives us heartache and the devil gives us whiskey Randall says as he downs a shot. He's seems to be standing at an ordinary bar not an illegal speakeasy. But the year is 1931 just before the end of Prohibition. The premiere was September 1931. Drink is a frank and normal reality in much of the movie as people swig from bottles in their desk and meet at the bar after work and it's an eyeopener to counteract the more extreme portrayals of alcohol in the movies. And of course it's normal for the viewer in the theater at the time as well part of the general feeling that the time had come to change the laws which Roosevelt did in early 1933.So see this if you like preCode films but stick it out through the more mundane parts. It's worth it.".

And a slew of decent smaller parts keep it interesting like Aline MacMahon playing a stenographer and in her first film role and Marian Marsh who plays the daughter with increasing intensity right up to the highly volatile last scene.This is the heyday of the unsung Mervyn LeRoy a director with at least two unsurpassed movies Three on a Match and I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang not including his work on Wizard of Oz. He has a dozen other really good films to his name and this one survives despite some filler and a slightly functional approach to the acting and staging. This was the day when directors and their crews were pressed to shoot movies in a couple weeks or so and it shows.I only wish you could see the second half of this movie alone. It gets more dramatic and more intense and the one painfully wooden actress dies and it really drives home the point against yellow abusive journalism. The first half is stale enough to turn off a lot of viewers I'm sure and it brings down my overall impression of the totality. Luckily if you make it to the end you nearly forget the forgettable beginning and will leave with a good taste in your mouth.And all the drinking in the movie? God gives us heartache and the devil gives us whiskey Randall says as he downs a shot. He's seems to be standing at an ordinary bar not an illegal speakeasy. But the year is 1931 just before the end of Prohibition. The premiere was September 1931. Drink is a frank and normal reality in much of the movie as people swig from bottles in their desk and meet at the bar after work and it's an eyeopener to counteract the more extreme portrayals of alcohol in the movies. And of course it's normal for the viewer in the theater at the time as well part of the general feeling that the time had come to change the laws which Roosevelt did in early 1933.So see this if you like preCode films but stick it out through the more mundane parts. It's worth it.";

Robinson plays the editor of a newspaper whose publisher instructs Robinson to come up with a story that will increase circulation. Robinson's solution is to track down a woman who killed the father of her child twenty years before when he refused to marry her but she was acquitted largely because of her child. She has since married and her daughter is on the eve of her own marriage and has no idea of her mother's past. Robinson's what ever happened to idea is a success but at a horrible cost to the family involved.Not on DVD or VHS the film uses some techniques that were rather odd for Warner Bros at the time considering that their urban dramas usually were very fastpaced. To begin with the film makes a big production of introducing Robinson to the audience having the other players talk about him at length and even showing a shot of just his hands as he washes up before he makes his big entrance. Then  the whole movie proceeds to switch its dramatic center more to the family that Robinson's newspaper is writing a scandal piece on and its tragic effect on them.Robinson and Boris Karloff  in an odd turn as an alcoholic reporter just prior to his starmaking role in Frankenstein  have acting in the age of sound down to a fine art. However the actors playing the roles of the family targeted by Robinson's scandal sheet seem to be holdovers from the silent era the best known being silent star H.B. Warner. Their speech is somewhat slow and overdramatic and their gestures exaggerated but not ridiculously so. This might have been to contrast them with the hardboiled occupants of the newsroom but it makes the film look like it has two entirely different directors.".

	schema:reviewBody "The exploitativeness of tabloids is always a good subject even back in 1931. Five Star Final is about a ruthless editor Edward G. Robinson who hounds a woman involved in a 20yearold murder with tragic results. The film sports a good cast including Boris Karloff Mae Marsh Ona Munson Aline McMahon and H.B. Warner.Robinson as the editor decides to do a series on an old murder and track down one of the people involved Nancy Vorhees. She is now married with a daughter about to get married. The film looks at the effect it has on the lives of everyone in the family.I am not as enthusiastic about this film as some of the posters here though I imagine it was very hardhitting for 1931. The acting is very melodramatic and while I appreciated the devastating effects of the story I really thought a bad situation was made much worse by the behavior of the girl's parents at the end of the film. It wasn't until the midthirties that the class system in America began to disintegrate so it's still quite evident here with the way the young woman's future inlaws react to the scandal and Robinson's analysis of black readers.At the time the film was made any publicity was looked down upon  today it's considered a great thing though I don't suppose involvement in a murder would be. You might get a book deal out of it though and a TV movie. Nancy Voorhees today could have given the paper an exclusive interview and become a sympathetic character. But it was such a disgrace and people seemed to have no understanding or compassion.It's hard to judge the performances because the acting style and the dialogue are so different from even a few years later. Of all of them Aline McMahon as the cynical secretary comes off the best.Definitely worth seeing.".

While several of the leads the always good Robinson and Karloff Aline MacMahon and H.B.Warner give strong performances witness Warner's last three minutes in the film as the strain of his wife's tragedy finally destroys him there is too much of the 1931 staginess of the acting style of that day in FIVE STAR FINAL. Put this way my mother who watched the film with me enjoyed it but laughed at that staginess  she was born in 1928 so as a kid many movies of the early 1930s would have had that style of acting and she found it archaic.Bernarr MacFadden is recalled if at all as a one time newspaper owner and fooddiethealth faddist. The latter career is what most people remember one of his diethealth followers was Greta Garbo. Coming from the hinterlands MacFadden looked like a hick but had tremendous energy ego and ambition. He bought the failing New York Evening Graphic in the 1920s and taking full advantage of that age of ballyhoo turned it into the raggiest newspaper of the day. As mentioned he made up photographs supposedly showing the crimes and punishments he was reporting. He did everything to scoop the rival Hearst and other papers of news dirt. His intention was as was Hearst's with more plausibility to build himself into a national figure for political office  hoping to eventually become President. It did not work fortunately. I say that safely. I have read his editorials about the end of certain criminals and he sounds not soporific but childish in the intensity of his dislike in one of them he actually wrote something like Now he's dead dead dead...that'll show him!  I am not making that up!!.The depth of the Graphic's career really was in 1928. A ridiculous marriagedivorce case that of millionaire landlord Edward Browning age 70 and his young wife Peaches age under 20 broke out and instead of ignoring it and concentrating on real news MacFadden actually did his idiotic fake photos on the front page. Browning apparently like all husbands with their wives or people with their sex companions had private language with Peaches that the court revealed. When he wanted sex but badgered his wife he supposedly said Woof woof don't be a goof! and if he described intercourse he'd say Honk honk it's the bonk!. MacFadden showed Browning and Peaches in bedclothes in their bedroom with cartoon balloons with the expressions in them. The goof expression was coming from Browning but the bonk expression came from a goose or duck that was transposed into the frame of the picture probably because the latter's quack is sometimes like a honk.FIVE STAR FINAL was one of the favorite of Eddie Robinson. Coming a year after his breakout success in LITTLE CAESAR he was glad for once not to have to be a gangster but a city room editor on a tabloid ready to blow up. Robinson's Joseph Taylor has been working for a New York City newspaper for 10 years as editor before that he worked on other papers but none quite so sensational. The owner of this paper Hinchcliffe Oscar Apfel is a respectable looking millionaire but he is an archhypocrite. He likes higher and higher circulation and does not mind if he uses scandals to boost his paper. By the way some of the best minor sequences in FIVE STAR FINAL show Hinchclffe and Robinson discussing items that have to be moved or dropped and the effects on the public. Apparently their dropping of some articles by former Black heavyweight champ Jack Johnson about his girlfriends caused a dip in the circulation sales in Harlem Robinson adds to this tidbit by mentioning that his housekeeper stopped buying the newspaper when that happened!.The plot of the film is that a twenty year old homicide that resulted in the acquittal of the perpetrator is resurrected for circulation. The woman Marian Marsh has married H.B.Warner and has a daughter Frances Carr who is getting married to the son Anthony Bushnell of the a wealthy manufacturer. The revelation of the old scandal skillfully hidden by Marsh and Warner is threatened by the newspaper series. The older couple then compound the problem when they mistakenly trust Boris Karloff as a clergyman he was a defrocked theology student who now is a sleazy reporter. The revelations lead to deeper and deeper problems and eventual tragedy.Aline MacMahon is Robinson's secretary and girlfriend who knows he is better than his activities suggest. But it is not until the tragedy that Robinson's selfloathing for his activities emerges. It determines him on a showdown with Apfel which is complicated by the arrival of another party who wants a confrontation and an explanation.The film is good if some of the dialog turns to be too racy and even bigoted at times. The issue of the limits of a free press are always with us and this presents it quite well up to Robinson's final commentary and actions to show his disgust with his job.How true is it that we do not forgive old felons or suspects in crimes? It varies. Those who are pedophiles or sex criminals are rarely forgiven especially as they have to register with the police in many jurisdictions. As for our murderers well you have the example of O. J. Simpson and how he may now be finally facing a delayed punishment in a different crime. On the other hand you have the case of the successful detective story novelist Anne Perry who went to prison as a juvenile for murder. There is no universal rule on accepting these people one way or another. It probably depends on the crime involved.".

	schema:reviewBody "Another reviewer mentioned that this was ahead of its time and they were right. Most of these fuzzy blackandwhite 1930s movies about detective reporters and one or another particeps criminis seem hastily flung together. They're pretty crummy. You await the outcome only because you're barely curious. It's like waiting for a particularly dull jigsaw puzzle to be completed just because you've already invested so much time in it.Except for an unnecessary and hysterical ending this one is exceptional. Robinson is the editor of a New York tabloid. The owners are all over him for the paper's low circulation so Robinson orders his reporters to dig up the story of a twentyyearold murder a love tragedy and find the woman who shot her philandering paramour. Dig into it. Find out where she lives what happened to her and we'll run a daily special on her crime and her current life.It's not such a hot idea from a moral point of view a little like Absence of Malice. The murderer Nancy Voorhees now Nancy Townsend Frances Starr has established a new life with a good man H. B. Warner. Nancy's daughter Marian Marsh is a student at Hunter College and is supposed to marry a devoted young man from a family of social standing. The story wrecks their happy lives and leads to two suicides. Robinson at the urging of his secretary Aline MacMahon tells off his bosses throws a telephone through a glass door and quits.A few observations. Almost everyone overacts but that's to be expected in a year when sound was hardly established and silentmovie conventions prevailed. Frances Starr is especially egregious in this regard. There are moments when her performance looks like a parody.Robinson is introduced washing his hands and MacMahon remarks that he does it compulsively several times a day. Cf. Lady MacBeth. Prohibition was still the law in 1931 yet everybody saunters in and out of Corcoran's to have a drink. Robinson keeps a pint stashed in his desk drawer.There are some nice precode tickles in the dialog. Ziggie Feinstein is arranging a taxi race from the Bronx to midtown and he's already fixed it. I'm going to let an Irishman a Jew and a Wop win. When a lowlife employee threatens to quit Robinson gets to quote the Bible O Death where is thy sting? Of his secretary who sits and glares at him disapprovingly Don't just sit there like a visible conscience. And God gives us heartaches the devil gives us whiskey. I don't claim these are flights of poetry just that you're unlikely to find lines even of this level of originality as Philo Vance goes about solving a mystery.One of the lower forms of reporter is the silkily sinister Boris Karloff who poses as a priest in order to get the dish  when he's sober. The character's name is Mr. Isopod. It's hard to believe that was an accident. In Greek it means even footed or even by extension even handed whereas in fact he's a scurrilous skank.".

The murderer Nancy Voorhees now Nancy Townsend Frances Starr has established a new life with a good man H. B. Warner. Nancy's daughter Marian Marsh is a student at Hunter College and is supposed to marry a devoted young man from a family of social standing. The story wrecks their happy lives and leads to two suicides. Robinson at the urging of his secretary Aline MacMahon tells off his bosses throws a telephone through a glass door and quits.A few observations. Almost everyone overacts but that's to be expected in a year when sound was hardly established and silentmovie conventions prevailed. Frances Starr is especially egregious in this regard. There are moments when her performance looks like a parody.Robinson is introduced washing his hands and MacMahon remarks that he does it compulsively several times a day. Cf. Lady MacBeth. Prohibition was still the law in 1931 yet everybody saunters in and out of Corcoran's to have a drink. Robinson keeps a pint stashed in his desk drawer.There are some nice precode tickles in the dialog. Ziggie Feinstein is arranging a taxi race from the Bronx to midtown and he's already fixed it. I'm going to let an Irishman a Jew and a Wop win. When a lowlife employee threatens to quit Robinson gets to quote the Bible O Death where is thy sting? Of his secretary who sits and glares at him disapprovingly Don't just sit there like a visible conscience. And God gives us heartaches the devil gives us whiskey. I don't claim these are flights of poetry just that you're unlikely to find lines even of this level of originality as Philo Vance goes about solving a mystery.One of the lower forms of reporter is the silkily sinister Boris Karloff who poses as a priest in order to get the dish  when he's sober. The character's name is Mr. Isopod. It's hard to believe that was an accident. In Greek it means even footed or even by extension even handed whereas in fact he's a scurrilous skank.";

	schema:reviewBody "This is an amazing newspaper drama about a scandal sheet the New York Evening Globe that focuses on gossip whether slander or not destroying lives they have no business interfering in. And why bring up a 20 year old murder where the exonerated killer has reformed lived a decent life and is preparing to see the illegitimate daughter from that scandal be married into high society? Because that's what scandal sheets do then now but hopefully not always. 82 years after this film was released its message is still clear yet the attack it makes on these trash moguls has not been heeded only worsened through today's hideous social media.The story here surrounds a woman Frances Starr who killed her lover who left her pregnant and refused to marry her. She was exonerated married a man whom she truly grew to love H.B. Warner and has raised a beautiful daughter Marian Marsh. At the Evening Globe the owners suggest bringing back the story in serial form and find out what happened to her. Marsh's fiance's Anthony Bushell parents are not forgiving and as more of her past is exposed Starr makes a drastic decision which results in tragedy for everybody and hopefully a guilt that will follow the Globe's owners to the grave.Under their thumb is Edward G. Robinson who goes along with the story yet as the clock ticks away his own guilt surfaces especially when Starr keeps trying to get ahold of him or the owners to beg them to cease the story for her daughter's sake. This is where the film is almost like the countdown to an execution and the great tension arrives. Aline MacMahon in her film debut is outstanding giving one of the greatest performances I've ever seen on film. She admits she's working in this position because it was the only job she can find finds everything her employers do disgusting and turns to drink to get the bad taste out of her mouth hoping it will give her the courage to tell her boss whom she obviously is in love with off. Robinson finally gathers the courage to face the truth and his confrontation with his boss may have you cheering.In smaller roles as some of the sleazy reporters are George E. Stone Ona Munson and Boris Karloff. The future King of Horror plays one of the sleaziest characters ever on film He's a defrocked minister who continues to wear the uniform to get his victims to confide in him. Even Munson playing pretty sleazy here herself admits she is disgusted by him. The scene where Marsh confronts the Globe is celluloid at its eeriest with Karloff frightened out of his boots as he faces his sins at the hands of one of the victims.The reason these stories fascinate the public is obvious. As the musical Sweet Smell of Success based upon the 1957 film noir indicated the public thrives on dirt and they don't even care if it's true. You may as I did find this film to be an excellent expose on the evils of abuse because of the freedom of the press yet you will be angry as you should be. Think of that the next time you pass a newspaper rack at your local grocery store and see some innocent person's life being exposed in print or turn on your morning news to find out that it is not news only unnecessary gossip.".

	schema:reviewBody "It wasn't very long into this picture that I realized I had seen it before only the first time it was called Two Against The World starring Humphrey Bogart. First National Pictures apparently decided to do a remake of Five Star Final in 1936 and selected a radio venue to retell the story. Bogey has the Robinson role and virtually everything about the film is a dead on copy as a twenty year old murder case is revived in a fifteen chapter radio play. Quite honestly if you've seen one of these pictures you've seen them both but don't let that dissuade you from doing just that. Robinson and Bogart are two of my favorites so neither should be denied your attention. By the way the TV title of the Bogey flick is One Fatal Hour so if it shows up on Turner Classics you know you've got the right one.There's one inherent problem with these films from the Thirties that prove to be quite distracting. Consider the wedding day of Jenny Marian Marsh and Phillip Anthony Bushell. The early edition of The Gazette carries the announcement of the upcoming Nancy Voorhees murder case. Even though the pictures of Jenny and Phillip are prominent on the front page they both make it through the entire day without becoming aware of it. Nancy Voorhees Frances Starr now Townsend attempts to get the newspaper to kill the story and failing takes her own life. Beleaguered husband Michael H.B. Warner also commits suicide after sending the young couple off to the church saying he'll meet them there later with Nancy. Front page headlines of the double suicide hit the street the same day! OK there was a late edition of the paper but seriously the real time concurrence of events as they happen with their reportage in the paper is just too much of a stretch.What you might better concentrate on here are the performances. Edward G. Robinson in a nongangster role as Gazette editor Randall is quite compelling. A surprising presence in the picture is Boris Karloff as a sleazy tabloid reporter taking on the Voorhees assignment with relish. Of the remaining support cast editor Randall's secretary Aline MacMahon raises eyebrows early when she comments on a female reporter's firing because she was 'flatchested' then uses her hands to gesture the bosomy figure of her prospective replacement Kitty Carmody Ona Munson. You never know what hidden gems you'll find like this in preCode films so it's worth the effort just for that.Other reviewers for the film on this board make a point of mentioning Jenny Townsend's confrontation with the newspapermen at the finale. It's a stirring rebuttal against the sleazy sensationalism of tabloid journalism and an indictment of the press in the culpability of her mother's death  Why did you kill my mother? It's enough to make Randall quit and it would have been a kicker if he stormed out of The Gazette with Miss Taylor in tow the way Bogart did with his secretary in the later picture. Instead the story closes with a copy of The Gazette being swept up in a gutter hostage to the rest of the trash that has a way of accumulating in the grime of the city.".

They are two of the world's great actors capable of reaching across the full range of the acting spectrum from explosive emotions to farce to whimsical or dark introspection as they do in Peindre ou faire l'amour.Auteuil he of that magnificent Gallic face plays a retired meteorologist who from force of habit perhaps slips into regular inane and humorous asides about the weather. As his beautiful wife Azema is a talented landscape painter. They're both in their late 50s and they decide to retire to the country and live out their golden years in idyllic examinations of wondrous nature and the philosophy of being.Anyone living in retirement this writer for example knows this is a noble idea but it rarely if ever works. Boredom and ennui creep in very quickly after one retires despite the bullblip and smarmy insurance company agitprop to the contrary. Retirement means disorientation a separation from routine and self and the characters in Peindre etc. demonstrate this very well.Enter Sergei Lopez an edgy and terrific actor who so convincingly played the violent and obsessively jealous husband in the Spanish film Sole Mia. In Peindre etc. he is a blind man who captivates Azema through his disturbing mystique and his supersensitivity to smell and sound. Lopez's wife is the lovely Amira Casar and they're called Adam and Eva not exactly a subtle choice of names by writersdirectors and brothers Armand and JeanMarie Larrieu. Lopez and Casar in the nonBiblical sense metaphorically create a new world for Auteuil and Azema. Lopez's character is deceptive he appears kind caring gentle but beneath it there's mischief if not malice brewing he 'sees' much more than the merely sighted and he quietly manipulates both Auteuil and Azema so much so that they begin to alter their lives because of him. Both couples just casually fall into an adulterous relationship that is done with such minimalist matteroffactness by the Larrieus that you really wonder if it's happening at all. The mini'swinging' is done with an unusual lack of fuss  you won't see the usual and these days hopelessly overdone surfeit of moaning writhing and sweating bodies. The adulterous act a first for Auteuil and Azema is initially traumatic but then becomes a galvanizing force in their new 'retired' lives. Questions arise what does love really mean when partners 'switch' for sexual purposes while still professing profound love for each other? Are they in fact REALLY in love? In the midst of their carnality who are they really deceiving other than each other? Does sex really have any meaning other than selfsatisfaction or selfabsorption? I liked this understated film because it skillfully handles difficult subject matter and raises very human questions. The moods of the characters and the film's premises are complemented by magnificent scenery light shadow and dark are regularly examined and contrasted. The aesthetic visions of both the artist and the sightless man who cannot 'see' beauty in the literal sense but articulates it through other heightened senses lead you to ask once again the ageless question what is art? The haunting music of the late Belgian 'cafe' singer Jacques Brel is a tremendous bonus. Both he and Canada's Leonard Cohen are unmatched in expressing powerful visceral and cerebral poetry in songs that probe the eternal mystery of love and why we somehow through the eons have never really understood its source or its power.".

Daniel Auteuil and Sabine Azma play very well together their first pairing I hope there will be more and Sergi Lopez and Amira Casar are also good as the couple who make swinging look so easy. William and Madeleine are mid50s their daughter is getting married in a couple of months so they are facing an empty nest with a little trepidation. Adam and Eva enter their lives and quickly establish an emotional dependency on the other couple's part. It is this dependency and not the sex that becomes decisive for William and Madeleine.This is the first feature by the Larrieu brothers that I have seen it is very promising. They know how to create an emotional atmosphere without camera tricks or an annoying sound track. I advise men with heart problems to skip the scene with Hlne de SaintPre when she takes her dress off she reveals a truly astounding body.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is a very good little film that starts off enigmatically I thought I was watching something by Rohmer from his Green Ray period and gets better and better as it goes along. Daniel Auteuil and Sabine Azma play very well together their first pairing I hope there will be more and Sergi Lopez and Amira Casar are also good as the couple who make swinging look so easy. William and Madeleine are mid50s their daughter is getting married in a couple of months so they are facing an empty nest with a little trepidation. Adam and Eva enter their lives and quickly establish an emotional dependency on the other couple's part. It is this dependency and not the sex that becomes decisive for William and Madeleine.This is the first feature by the Larrieu brothers that I have seen it is very promising. They know how to create an emotional atmosphere without camera tricks or an annoying sound track. I advise men with heart problems to skip the scene with Hlne de SaintPre when she takes her dress off she reveals a truly astounding body.";

It's smart charming has a lot of style and is quite humorous. Great outdoor scenes. Since it is a story who's principal character is an artist I expected it to go overboard with stylized cinematography and try to create every scene as a painting but it didn't do that. It gave you the flavor of her love of painting without trying to recreate it on screen. This is a refreshing movie in that it's all about middle age people and so is the audience they seek. The baby boomer audience who are in 2006 between the ages of 42 and 60 should expect to see more movies geared to their age group coming their way. The cast is great in this movie and the four central characters and two supporting characters are a fun study. Great music in this too. I would give it a 7.0 out of a possible 10 and recommend it.".

	schema:reviewBody "RELEASED IN 1996 and directed by Nils Gaup North Star is a Western that takes place in Nome Alaska during a gold rush in 1899. James Caan plays the lovetohate mogul who denies mining claims to foreigners and attempts to kill a halfbreed Indian Christopher Lambert for the claim to a cave filled with gold which the Natives use in their ceremonies. The halfbreed ends up abducting the mogul's woman played by the beautiful Catherine McCormack who you might remember as Wallace's doomed wife at the beginning of Braveheart 1995. The Winter chase is on!There are elements of other Westerns here like Death Hunt 1981 Valdez is Coming 1971 The Far Country 1954 North to Alaska 1960 and Dances With Wolves 1990 but that's to be expected. On the originality side it's one of the few fully Winter Westerns of which I can remember beyond The Great Silence 1968 and The Hateful Eight 2015. Of course films like Will Penny 1967 Jeremiah Johnson 1972 A Man Called Sledge 1970 and a few others have some fairly long Winter sequences.While Caan's villainy is too overthetop for my tastes although he does it well I found North Star to be a welldone Western except that the final 11 minutes or so feel rushed. As noted above I was impressed that this was one of the first Westerns I've seen that focused exclusively on Winter conditions. It goes without saying that shooting in the snow is way more challenging than shooting in other seasons and even more so if the locale is mountainous. The locations sets and cast are all firstrate even while the storytelling has somewhat of a comic booky Grade B vibe.But the filmmakers seemed to hurry the ending. Maybe they wanted to just complete the project and keep it under 90 minutes or perhaps they weren't confident with the closing footage and awkwardly tried to make it work in the editing room. But it's not THAT bad and didn't ruin the experience for me. At the end of the day North Star is a worthwhile 'modern Western' that attempts something unique even while being a pastiche of the genre.THE FILM RUNS 88 minutes and was shot in Norway.

However it was made in 1995 and while the story had a good deal of potential as a great if mindless adventure story it unfortunately is too tame for modern viewers. They will probably be either very bored or just not interested. While the characters are effective and the story is loaded with some great stuff it simply pales to films of its kind including Cliffhanger and White Fang.That said the cast is excellent if a little miscast. James Caan is the villian a man maddened by the isolated confounds of Nome Alaska. Having lived there for many years I knew many people in his situation and he does as a good a job as possible showing the effects such desolate surroundings can have on the human spirit. He nails the performance and shows why he's the celebrated actor that he is and he makes dialogue such as Nobody dies until I tell them to die!  sound miraculously believable.Christopher Lambert also brings passion to the role of the halfbreed Indian who is trying to protect his land from Caan. While it is obviously a miscast he's part Eskimo like I'm Clark Gable! he does a commendable job as a man torn between loyalties protecting a land from a native people who don't necessarily trust him. I don't think he was the ideal choice for the role simply because he's obviously French but the subtly and haunted characteristics that he demonstrates here shows a great deal of flair and concern for making this film work. Between he and Caan not to mention an altogether underused Catherine McCormick they almost manage to lift this tame adventure story above standards. Unfortunately good perfomances can't save it. Only style and more overthetop actions scenes would have and that is where the movie is lacking. Still it's not a bad film to watch during the dogdays of summer for a little pickmeup. 12 out of ".

He tries to kill Lambert a half Eskimo who had the good sense to file a claim on his people's sacred and gold rich cave.It isn't boring but a chase movie where Christopher Lambert squares off against James Caan and Burt Young in a savage frontier battle for survival should have generated more heat than this especially being that this is cowritten by Sergio Donati who also helped pen For A Few Dollars More and Once Upon A Time In The West!It's pretty straight forward and unpretentious but it made me wish it were more compelling. The characters were pretty cardboard though Caan seems to be having some fun swinging back and forth between greedy and treacherous to insane and out of control.Also everyone appears to be underdressed. This movie takes place in Nome Alaska during a snowstorm but everyone's dressed like it's Fall.Lee Marvin and Charles Bronson were better in Death Hunt watch that one first!".

He goes from bad to evil to maniacal in the course of the story here with a twist in the picture that comes out of nowhere that attempts to explain his hatred of the half breed Hudson Santeek Christopher Lambert. That he's a half breed himself serves no purpose other than to cause this viewer to go Oh! so I don't know why that element was even introduced.While watching the film I hearkened back to my childhood days with 'Sergeant Preston Of The Yukon' this could have been an extended episode of that show. Great footage of Alaskan sled dogs mushing through wind whipped snowy trails not quite figuring out how competing sled teams didn't get all tangled up with each other. One thing Preston never had to put up with was getting shot and falling into icy rivers. Man I can't imagine even being THAT cold! I wonder if the actors got bonus pay for that.I caught this on the Encore Western Channel this evening and I suppose the 'Western' connotation has some bearing even if filmed as an Alaskan wilderness adventure. It's got a typically 'B' Western flavor focusing on an evil town boss Caan swindling local miners out of their gold claims and leaving them dead in his wake. I can't think of a Western that ever got the bodydeed count as high as eleven like this picture did which can only mean that Christopher Lambert was no Red Ryder or Durango Kid.

It did remind me of the Charles Bronson and Lee Marvin 1980 feature Death Hunt. In Alaska in the 1890s a halfbreed trapper becomes the target of a crooked businessman who wants the land of his ancestors and the only way to do so is to kill the halfbreed. The plot's foundation harbours familiar trappings but never really comes alive with no real momentum or character interest. The action is uninspired dialogues forced and the direction rather stagy in a cheap looking production. It's the villainous performances of an unhinged James Caan and a burly Burt Young that keeps it from freezing over. Add to that the vivid snowy locations that dress up the screen. Catherine McCormick shows up but gets little to do. A sleepy flatfooted chase drama.".

Meanwhile Swedish immigrant Bjorn Svenson wants to claim the land where he has been mining for months but immigrants are not allowed to have claims.  He has to appeal to Sean McLennon who seems to make the rules in this town and has plenty of money but could always use more. McLennon won't listen because he despises immigrants as well as halfbreeds and anyone who stands in his way.  Later one of these two problems is dealt with by a kidnapping and so begins a wintry wilderness adventure.If you like scenes of sled dogs racing through the snow this movie may be for you though this wouldn't have been my first choice it just happened to be on TV.  There's lots of excitement once the adventure gets going and some strange plot twists.  James Caan made a deliciously evil and almost comical villain at least at first.  Later he was just plain mean. The Indians talked mostly in a native language which added to the realism and I think most of them gave good performances. One Indian woman never said a word and yet she could show emotion just with her face even with very little movement.  And one dog who was listed in the credits as a wolf even seemed to have a personality.  Reidar Sorenson was also quite good as Bjorn with a style that made me wonder if he has done Shakespeare.Still this is not that special and maybe there have been movies like this which were done better.".

	schema:reviewBody "Had North Star been made in let's say the 60s or 70s then I would be able to watch it and classify it as maybe an eight or ninestar film. It's got the kind of plot that would suit a 90s movie but the way it's made is far too reminiscent of the past. And when you mix a film that looks modern with a style of the past it comes out a bit campy. For example the screenplay seems like it was written a long time ago and went unchanged until just now. Characters laughing at jokes and stuff that are not even remotely funny were common back in the 60s and 70s but not in films of the 90s. I hate to say it but sound effects and stuff in this movie like that are also no better than the Westerns of long ago. Thus the shootouts aren't that exciting. Some parts of North Star go on for too long some parts whip by way too fast.There are some positive aspects to North Star though. Even though it does seem like it's made in the wrong time and kind of cheesy it is a film that you can sit down and watch without getting bored. Sure you'll be thinking a lot man that was...weird or that wasn't very thrilling or that was disappointing but it is a film where you want to see the rest of it. That's what made me give this film five out of ten stars for a rating. But it's still heavily flawed and had it been made twenty or thirty years before it really was I think it would have been better.".

The editing is puzzling to say the least with large moments of time obviously missing on the cutting room floor. Finally the ending is so scattered it almost seems like the director was unsure when to yell cut. There are only two reasons to endure the mercifully short 89 minutes of North Star. James Caan turns in a wonderfully bizarre performance as the heavy and the snowy landscapes provide a nice backdrop and diversion from the sub par script and acting.  MERK".

NORTH STAR sets its story in Alaska and features James Caan as the hunter and Christopher Lambert as his quarry.Despite a decent pacing and some good setdressing  you never question the setting for a moment  this film has little to recommend it. Lambert fans are there any? will be let down by their star's performance which is wooden even by Lambert standards little he says or does rings true and he's almost entirely lacking in star presence. There's a hollowness in the middle of the film which a proper actor should be filling with charisma wit and heroism.James Caan is much better as the arrogant villain a role he also played to the hilt in ERASER. He chews the scenery and shares a decent rapport with Burt Young playing a fellow bad guy for a change and doing well with it. Catherine McCormack is once again wasted as a love interest though leaving 28 WEEKS LATER the only film I've seen that actually makes use of her acting talents.The pace is good and the outdoor wilderness scenes look fantastic really bringing the chilly wasteland to life. Scenes of the participants sledging through snowdrifts on their huskydrawn sleighs are a lot of fun. It's just a shame that there's no real meat on the bones and that the ending is lacklustre to say the least. NORTH STAR fizzles instead of bangs and that's why this wintry western has been long since forgotten.".

	schema:headline " Bloodsucking Frisbees Thrown By Man with Lampshade For a Head";
	schema:reviewBody "This very weird drivein flick directed by Greydon Clark is pretty creepy in a brainless sort of way. Predating the Predator concept by a number of years Without Warning involves a mysterious alien presence lurking in the woods claiming campers and backpackers with the use of living tentacled flying discs it hurls at potential victims. The fact that the killer is an alien gives it a faux scifi twist but in reality this has more in common with Friday the 13th albeit with flying alien discs. The alien itself spends most of the movie offscreen throwing its frisbees at people then harvesting them and storing their bodies in a convenient old shack normally used by the water department who are marginally less frightening than murderous aliens. The obnoxious characters might get on your nerves particularly the stereotypical shellshocked vet portrayed by Martin Landau. The young male lead is also pretty irritating badmovie junkies may recognize him from Roller Boogie. One of the biggest pleasures of the film is the presence of numerous bmovie personalities and character actors a number of whom also appeared in Greydon Clark's second alien thriller of 1980 The Return. Palance and Landau light years away from their Oscars really ham it up big time alongside Larry Storch Neville Brand Eaten Alive Ralph Meeker The Night Stalker Food of the Gods Cameron Mitchell God where to begin??. Look fast for a very young David Caruso as an early alien snack. Further linking the film to Predator is that the alien in this film is played by the same actor who played The Predator the late Kevin Peter Hall.It's definitely a lowrent affair but there is some good stuff here. The atmospheric photography helps although the low quality video transfers that are circulating out there do a lot to detract from it. The script takes some welcome short cuts in the early stages wasting no time in getting one half of our dual teenage couples bumped off and leaving the remaining two on the run. The action takes place in a number of dark desolate places. At least the counselors at Crystal Lake had a few bungalows to take refuge in. The protagonists of Without Warning scurry through old shacks dark open fields abandoned cottages and rundown redneck bars. Brrr. The bloodsucking frisbee effect is fairly well done too.Then there's the matter of the alien. It's very silly looking in full light but they don't really let you get a good look at it and it's vaguely creepy the way it's photographed. In one scene we catch our first real glimpse of it as it's approaching on the other side of a swinging pendant lamp a la Psycho. The lamp swings up and momentarily illuminates the weird grasping figure. Eerie. There's also a great shot at the conclusion where Jack Palance exacts his revenge on the visitor by planting dynamite outside the shack. He grapples with the deranged Landau until suddenly they both look up and standing there in the distance is the alien watching them. Unfortunately the scene is defused by the campy overacting and dialogue.We have yet to get a quality home video release for Without Warning at least in the United States. It seems to have slipped through the cracks or is tied up in a matter of studio ownership. My only regret is that I never got to see this one at the drivein which is obviously where it was meant to be enjoyed. It meets that lofty goal very nicely.".

The atmospheric photography helps although the low quality video transfers that are circulating out there do a lot to detract from it. The script takes some welcome short cuts in the early stages wasting no time in getting one half of our dual teenage couples bumped off and leaving the remaining two on the run. The action takes place in a number of dark desolate places. At least the counselors at Crystal Lake had a few bungalows to take refuge in. The protagonists of Without Warning scurry through old shacks dark open fields abandoned cottages and rundown redneck bars. Brrr. The bloodsucking frisbee effect is fairly well done too.Then there's the matter of the alien. It's very silly looking in full light but they don't really let you get a good look at it and it's vaguely creepy the way it's photographed. In one scene we catch our first real glimpse of it as it's approaching on the other side of a swinging pendant lamp a la Psycho. The lamp swings up and momentarily illuminates the weird grasping figure. Eerie. There's also a great shot at the conclusion where Jack Palance exacts his revenge on the visitor by planting dynamite outside the shack. He grapples with the deranged Landau until suddenly they both look up and standing there in the distance is the alien watching them. Unfortunately the scene is defused by the campy overacting and dialogue.We have yet to get a quality home video release for Without Warning at least in the United States. It seems to have slipped through the cracks or is tied up in a matter of studio ownership. My only regret is that I never got to see this one at the drivein which is obviously where it was meant to be enjoyed. It meets that lofty goal very nicely.";

	schema:reviewBody "This movie RULEZ. Don't listen to the negativists they seem to be patently refusing to get into the spirit of things probably turned off by the low budget utterly ordinary  banal settings ludicrous plot twists and unhinged performances. But trust me this is what I do for a living Anyone with a taste for outrageous low budget Amercian made regional horror will find a masterpiece here waiting to be unleashed.The plot is already summed up well by other admirers Alien being decides to go hunting in the woods of what looks like rural Oklahoma using an elaboration on those flying pancake monsters from the old Star Trek series that would smack onto someone's back and drive them insane. These have revolting little teeth pincers and claws glom onto people and suck the ooze out of their brains. The Alien himself is right out of Whitley Strieber  a 7 foot tall gray who's motives are never explained and who's demise is one of the most satisfying conclusions to a horror movie I have seen in months. The Alien's flying pancake killings are gory inventively staged unpredictable in occurrence and made to create squeals of disgust from viewers who if they allow themselves to get caught up in the proceedings will feel like they are 10 years old again  watching Creature Feature matine when they should be outside doing chores. Even without any exploitational nudity this movie is a guilty pleasure dream come true.BUT the thing that entranced me the most about the film was  amazingly  the performances or rather the job of the actors in personifying the community of individuals depicted all of whom come across as real people in the same way that The Simpson's characters also feel real. And what an amazing onceinalifetime cast!! It's almost worth it just to see all these people involved in the same movie project Cameron Mitchell at his grizzled method acting best. Martin Landau immersed in another role that absorbs him whole like a sponge Landau's Oscar for ED WOOD was no mistake. Ralph Meeker as a bar patron who's bemused indifference to the proceedings is only matched by film legend Neville Brand who's response to being informed that he is in the middle of an actual alien invasion is to order up another beer. Darby Hinton Lynn Theel a prefame David Caruso former child actor hearthrob Christopher S. Nelson a wacky Larry Storch and frequent monster movie monster Kevin Peter Hall all contribute wonderfully. And the underseen Tarah Nutter makes a very believable young heroine shoved into the role of saving her planet whether she wants to or not.But the movie is stolen lock stock and smoking barrels by Jack Palance God bless the man. Usually cast as a scheming duplicitous villain here he plays a completely unhinged local hunter who happens upon the invasion and decides to go ManoaMano with the Alien weathering no less than three close encounters with the flying pancakes  surviving them all by slicing the things off his body with a knife. Anyone else except maybe Cameron Mitchell would look ridiculous while cutting off a goo spewing alien pancake monster from their thigh but somehow Palance manages to find a performance in the routine. And again here is evidence that his Oscar for CITY SLICKERS was no accident either He is a national treasure who's distinctively scarred face should be added to Mount Rushmore  his story enshrined in a monument.How else can you put it? WITHOUT WARNING may be the ultimate Jack Palance movie aside from maybe SHANE and CAN BE DONE AMIGO and is so utterly perfect in it's execution that I was howling with glee at finally encountering a movie that pushed nearly every geek nerve button in my skull. I love the low budget effects offbeat performances totally unremarkable settings the unpredictable story arc and the climactic ending which got a round of applause from the house. The movie looks like it was filmed in  around the woods down by the drainage ditch about three blocks away and is proof that you don't need a huge budget a moron Alist face like Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt or flashy computer generated effects to make a very satisfying little creature feature. All you need is enough imagination guile  ingenuity to make such happen yourself though having a Jack Palance and a Martin Landau handy will certainly help.And that leads me to my one problem with the film Landau's crazed Vietnam veteran character. It's not that his actions were implausible it's just that it would have been more fun if he and Palance's equally grizzled hunter character had teamed up and pitted their combined mental instabilities paranoia and capability for violence against this thing. Someone goofed on the screenplay level and missed an opportunity there and as such my rating for this is diminished from the 9 star affair it really should have been. But make no mistake  listen not to the Negative Nellies from Sector Nine You won't regret investing your 90 minutes into this movie if low budget horror alien invasion and wacko backwoods regional quirk films are your cup of tea. If they aren't go rent the comparatively vacant WAR OF THE WORLDS with Mr. Cruise who compared to Mr. Palance does not even come across as being convincing at playing a guy who holds a day job  owns a cat. Give me junk like this any day of the week and use your 105 million dollars to feed the continent of Africa next time Mr. Spielberg You have been OWNED.810".

The movie is about this couple that is being chased around this mountainwooded area by an Alien hunter a pure amateur when compared to Predator who hunts with living disks that he throws at his prey.  The disks are the best and worst effect in the movie best being that when stuck to a person or tree or vehicle they look believable worst when flying through the air.  The couple is helped by a fanatic hunter who is trying to kill the alien and dogged by this not so helpful army veteran.   On the whole if you like Bhorror films this one is worth seeing if you can find a copy.  But if you are looking for good acting riveting story and the like look someplace else.

	schema:reviewBody "Without Warning 1980 was an interesting movie. The plot was lifted and remade into a lame movie called Predator. This low budget horror film starred a trio of hard living actors Jack Palance Neville Brand and Martin Landau. Times must have been hard on these great character actors sadly Neville Brand never received the recognition that he deserved as an actor. But LAndau and Palance went on to greater fame years later the two even costar in the highly underrated horror film ALONE IN THE DARK.The movie is about a giant alien who likes to stalk humans. One of his weapons is a bevy of flying blood sucking star fish. After stalking a bunch of daft coeds led by David Caruso. A haggard and sun baked hunter Jack Palance decides to have some fun and hunt the ultimate prey! What will happen when the Alien tangles with a middle aged dude who doesn't care about anyone or anything? You have to watch WITHOUT WARNING.Not a great film or a classic by any means. It's a fun party movie that gets better when you watch it with more people. Too bad it's hard to find.".

	onyx:emotionText "Without Warning 1980 was an interesting movie. The plot was lifted and remade into a lame movie called Predator. This low budget horror film starred a trio of hard living actors Jack Palance Neville Brand and Martin Landau. Times must have been hard on these great character actors sadly Neville Brand never received the recognition that he deserved as an actor. But LAndau and Palance went on to greater fame years later the two even costar in the highly underrated horror film ALONE IN THE DARK.The movie is about a giant alien who likes to stalk humans. One of his weapons is a bevy of flying blood sucking star fish. After stalking a bunch of daft coeds led by David Caruso. A haggard and sun baked hunter Jack Palance decides to have some fun and hunt the ultimate prey! What will happen when the Alien tangles with a middle aged dude who doesn't care about anyone or anything? You have to watch WITHOUT WARNING.Not a great film or a classic by any means. It's a fun party movie that gets better when you watch it with more people. Too bad it's hard to find.";

Don't you remember the time when Predator seemed to be the greatest and scariest movie ever? Have you tried watching it lately? I tried and fastforwarded it through because I couldn't take it. This movie however is a different story. Get some popcorn turn off the lights close your eyes and press play  welcome back to teenagehood with the bloodsucking starfishes ready to fly at you from every dark corner. This movie definitely has its own time and age cohort. Just don't expect anything to begin with and you will be surprisingly impressed by the movie.".

His first kills are a father and son who are enjoying the outdoors and it would be the last for them as well. And the Scout leader was an unfortunate victim leaving the Scouts running for their lives. How does this alien hunter kills so swiftly?

Later on they meet a former Army Sergeant who still think he's in the war feel there is an invasion. The store owner happens to be the most trusting is the one the two seems feel safe with. The whole ordeal with this movie is to survive the terror of being hunted by an alien hunter. A very good movie just a bit overlooked though.".

I liked the Alien  it looked stupid in some ways and i guess a bit dated with its costume but funny to watch.Martin Landau  a favorite actor i like to watch  does standout in this film. He overacts a bit as a disturbed Vietnam Vet sure. Although I still enjoyed his scenery Chewing Performance. He had kind of aged quickly from his Space 1999 Days a few years earlier and looked very old with his wrinkled face and long Black  gray hair in the film. I think he's the sort of actor that is very good at screaming Yelling and having that crazy look about him. Its funny to note how he kind of struggled in his film career in the 70s and early 80s but i still think some of his film roles where interesting and enjoyable to watch. In Without Warning he adds to the fear of the young teenagers that are being stalked in an isolated area with not too many people around with his eccentric personality. Jack Palance was great as the strange looking old Hunter that helps the teenagers. Cameron Mitchell was good trying to play a Tough Father who seems to think he's pretty sure of himself. Mitchell might only have been in the film for 5 minutes or so but his character shows interesting glimpses of a perhaps disturbed man. This is evident when he points his shotgun at his son from a distance in the bush and thinks about blowing him away as he is unhappy that his son is not a tough nut like himself that enjoys hunting and killing and maybe that his son was a Mama's Boy. An Interesting scene Anayway. If you can get a copy of Without Warning its worth a look. Watch it in the dark".

	schema:reviewBody "Well what can I say about this movie? Well firstly this was the first horror film I ever saw I was only about 8 years old. The plot is very simple. Basically you have an alien hunter on the loose in the woods killing people at will with the coolest weapons you could imagine..sorry predator you have been well beaten here pal. They consist of flying pizza shaped discs which the alien launches at various people. For what reason? Well I guess for trophies to take back with him for his own pleasure. The film begins with a hunter and his son out there in the woods hunting for...well anything really. However out of the blue they are attacked by these creatures and killed. This opening scene sets the tone for the type of movie you are in for. The main plot now consists of 4 kids who are planning to go for a swim in the lake. They are Warned beforehand not to go there by a helpful garage owner Jack Palance who obviously knows something about this alien lurking about in the remote woods. Do they listen?....well what do you think? The kids are eventually separated and 2 of them Greg and Sandy decide to go on a search for the other 2 Tom and Beth. Greg and Sandy find an old shack where they discover.....well i ain't telling you...watch the film. After a horrific ordeal Greg and Sandy are reunited with their old friend Joe Taylor Jack Palance and an eccentric Vietnam war veteran Fred Dobbs Martin Landau who both have their own ideas on how to deal with this alien who I'm afraid to say is not seen until the final scene in the movie. I reckon its worth the wait. The alien all 7 ft 4 of him is played by the late Kevin Peter Hall who went on to play the predator in the late 80's. This film was apparently the inspiration for the making of Predator. Why do I like this movie? Well the setting is great the acting is mediocre and the alien is just lethal...believe me he doesn't take no passengers. Being from the UK this movie ain't easy to get hold of anymore but you American viewers wont have a problem I'm sure. Take my word for it folks if you love cheesy 80's horror you won't be disappointed. My only criticism is 4 of the killings are off screen..then again I'm just never satisfied. ENJOY!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Without Warning is pretty good fun for fans of low budget monster movies and as I'm sure has been pointed out numerous times before works as a B level predecessor to the slicker and grander Predator. It even has the same actor playing the murderous alien the late great Kevin Peter Hall.The story is basically the same. This alien comes to Earth to stalk and slaughter human prey storing the bodies in an isolated shack belonging to the Water Department. Only a select few characters will be able to combat the creature in the end.Filmed in about three weeks for about 150000 this feature has enough good atmosphere and genuine creepiness to make it an enjoyable viewing. It boasts makeup  creature work by Greg Cannom and cinematography by Dean Cundey so there is a degree of professionalism behind the camera. The director is Greydon Clark a prolific B movie director who also gave us stuff like Black Shampoo Satan's Cheerleaders HiRiders Wacko and Joysticks. Unfortunately his work never led to any mainstream success but a number of his movies are now enjoyed as cult favourites.An amazing cast of familiar faces is fun to watch Jack Palance as crusty gas station owner Taylor Martin Landau as the completely unhinged exmilitary man Dobbs these two were reunited for Jack Sholders' Alone in the Dark two years later Neville Brand and Ralph Meeker as barflies Larry Storch as a Scoutmaster Cameron Mitchell as a macho hunter and Darby Hinton as his son Sue Ane Langdon as bar owner Aggie and David Caruso in one of his earliest screen roles as one of the four young people who venture into the woods for a good time. Costars Tarah Nutter and Lynn Theel look quite nice in their bikinis and are very likable as well.One of the best things about the movie is that for a while we're led to believe that the ugly little miniature Frisbees flying around are the menace when in fact they're used as a means of incapacitating victims by the alien antagonist who doesn't get a proper reveal until about a dozen minutes from the end. Even then we don't get that good a look at it. The music by Dan Wyman is effectively spooky. Without Warning further benefits from its woodsy setting and builds considerable suspense up until its explosive finish.It's a good little flick that is worth a look for scifi and horror fans eager to check out the lesser known efforts from decades past.Seven out of 10.".

	onyx:emotionText "Without Warning is pretty good fun for fans of low budget monster movies and as I'm sure has been pointed out numerous times before works as a B level predecessor to the slicker and grander Predator. It even has the same actor playing the murderous alien the late great Kevin Peter Hall.The story is basically the same. This alien comes to Earth to stalk and slaughter human prey storing the bodies in an isolated shack belonging to the Water Department. Only a select few characters will be able to combat the creature in the end.Filmed in about three weeks for about 150000 this feature has enough good atmosphere and genuine creepiness to make it an enjoyable viewing. It boasts makeup  creature work by Greg Cannom and cinematography by Dean Cundey so there is a degree of professionalism behind the camera. The director is Greydon Clark a prolific B movie director who also gave us stuff like Black Shampoo Satan's Cheerleaders HiRiders Wacko and Joysticks. Unfortunately his work never led to any mainstream success but a number of his movies are now enjoyed as cult favourites.An amazing cast of familiar faces is fun to watch Jack Palance as crusty gas station owner Taylor Martin Landau as the completely unhinged exmilitary man Dobbs these two were reunited for Jack Sholders' Alone in the Dark two years later Neville Brand and Ralph Meeker as barflies Larry Storch as a Scoutmaster Cameron Mitchell as a macho hunter and Darby Hinton as his son Sue Ane Langdon as bar owner Aggie and David Caruso in one of his earliest screen roles as one of the four young people who venture into the woods for a good time. Costars Tarah Nutter and Lynn Theel look quite nice in their bikinis and are very likable as well.One of the best things about the movie is that for a while we're led to believe that the ugly little miniature Frisbees flying around are the menace when in fact they're used as a means of incapacitating victims by the alien antagonist who doesn't get a proper reveal until about a dozen minutes from the end. Even then we don't get that good a look at it. The music by Dan Wyman is effectively spooky. Without Warning further benefits from its woodsy setting and builds considerable suspense up until its explosive finish.It's a good little flick that is worth a look for scifi and horror fans eager to check out the lesser known efforts from decades past.Seven out of 10.";

I saw it a couple of times as a kid and remember a bit about it I am still kicking myself for not buying the DVD in Suncoast when I had the chance. From what I remember of the movie it had some entertaining parts to it but it was hampered by this and that. All the kills are basically the same and the alien is not revealed till the very end of the film and it is not the best looking creature ever to grace the screen which probably explains why they did not show it through most of the film. Still the film had some good actors in it and that brought what was otherwise a b rate horror film up a notch. The weapon of choice for this alien hunter are this discus type weapons the catch being they are kind of alive and they suck blood. When I watched this movie as a kid I thought at first it was just the disc things flying around and killing people so the ending had a bit of a surprise to it. To bad that is ruined for most people by the cover of the DVD and description.".

A great little piece of scifi horror filmmaking at it's best. Shot by Dean Cundey before his huge films like Back to the future. Without Warning teams the talent of Jack Palance and Martin Landau. Friggin great!!! To see these two veterans running through the forest fighting flying alien pancakes is more then a good time. The film captures a time when theaters could show two films. I personally remember watching Without Warning on a double bill with Chuck Norris's The Octagon. PRICELESS. I don't want to give too much away but if you have the chance to watch Without Warning. DO IT!!! Have an open mind and just have fun with it and you won't be sorry. Be sure to look for a young David Caruso in the flick. They don't make them like this anymore and that's not a good thing.".
