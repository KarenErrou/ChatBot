Taking its inspiration from the reallife love affair of Jackie Kennedy and Aristotle Onassis the film is a glossy but absolutely empty soap opera of the kind that can be found on TV all day long. Viewers who embrace the whole celebrity magazine culture paparazzi photographs and gossipy stories about the rich and famous will undoubtedly find much to whet their appetite here. But those who prefer films with a bit more substance and craft and quirkiness will find the 107 minute running time a buttnumbing slog.American president James Cassidy James Franciscus and his beautiful wife Liz Jacqueline Bisset are in Greece on official business. A ridiculously wealthy Greek shipping tycoon Theo Tomasis Anthony Quinn catches sight of Liz at a party at his elegant manor. Despite the fact that both of them are married to someone else there is an immediate attraction between them. Later at a private party aboard his yacht Tomasis makes his desires known to Liz. Some while later President Cassidy is assassinated whilst out strolling on a beach. Liz is shocked and saddened by his death but it isn't long before she seeks comfort in the arms of her Greek lover Tomasis. Eventually the two of them are married and their love affair becomes a favourite talking point for the world's newspapers magazines photographers and wags.It is somewhat amusing to note the vigour with which the producers of this film denied that it was a dramatisation of the KennedyOnassis story. They wanted the film to be seen as an original story rooted in fiction. But anyone with a brain can see where the movie is drawing its inspiration from. Even Aristotle Onassis himself knew The Greek Tycoon amounted to his lovelife getting the Hollywood treatment if rumours are to be believed he actually had a hand in approving Anthony Quinn for the Tomasis role! J. LeeThompson isn't really the right sort of director for this type of movie  he's better suited to action fodder like The Guns Of Navarone and Ice Cold In Alex  but he marshals the proceedings with an uninspired professional adequacy. Quinn is very watchable as Tomasis Bisset looks lovely as the object of his desires Franciscus uses his toothy smile and a faade of integrity to make for a believable politician. Their performances are good on the surface but there's little for the actors to do on any deeper level. Similarly Tony Richmond's photography gives the film an elegant surface sheen as it moves from one exotic locale to the next but the merest of scratches proves that there's nothing behind the film's glossy exterior.".

He's killed and she goes to Onassis...you know the rest of the story.This was a huge hit in 1978 but destroyed by the critics. I think they were angry because the filmmakers kept insisting this was NOT about Kennedy and Onassis which it most certainly was. Facts were changed Onassis had a daughter in real life here it's a son and events but it was still pretty obvious. The characters themselves are treated very well. Bisset plays Cassidy as a beautiful frightened vulnerable yet strong woman. Quinn plays Tomasis as vulgar stubborn but strong and learning how to love. Also Quinn has an infectious laugh and hams it up in an enjoyable way.There's also beautiful scenery and a wonderful score. These combined with the acting push this across. No cinematic masterpiece but a pretty good love story if you can ignore the KennedyOnassis connection. I give it a 7.".

Jaqueline Bisset plays Liz a highclass prim and proper wife of James Franciscus who plays an ambitious politician named Jack Cassidy. The soontobe president has an equally ambitious brother Johnny played by Robin Clarke who soon gets promoted to Attorney General. I'm not kidding. They meet The Greek Tycoon who has silver hair and dark glasses named Theo Tomasis. I'm still not kidding.No one in Hollywood knows what happened behind closed doors between Jackie and Ari so beyond that the movie is probably largely fiction. I hope the movie is largely fictitious because neither lead is even remotely likable. Theo is an open womanizer who tells his new bride on his wedding night that he's going to sleep with his mistress the next day. He has a temper and unlike most Anthony Quinn roles he's not warm or tender underneath the roughness. Liz is cold and callous giving an unbelievably heartless speech after her husband's assassination. She also has a temper and she vacillates between boredom and anger with no reason for either. Also the socalled romance between the two is pretty ridiculous. She's married to a Cassidy and she's bored? She's married to a Cassidy and she is immediately drawn to the crude Theo even during her marriage? There's no reason for her hormones to take over when he's around but screenwriter Mort Fine thought the audience didn't need a reason. Tony does a Greek dance and all of a sudden she can't control herself. Jaqueline Bisset could have poured herself into the role but either she chose not to or she wasn't able to because I wasn't able to find any real acting on display. Anthony Quinn doesn't even do a good job! He gets in arguments with Jaqueline loses his temper throws a punch at his son Edward Albert and sleeps around with various women. That's about it. The music is like a bad '70s tv movie as is the very trite script. The only thing the movie manages to do is cast two actors are infinitely more attractive than the real people they're portraying.DLM Warning If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells like my mom does this movie might not your friend. The movie contains lots of shaky helicopter shots and that might make you sick. In other words Don't Look Mom!".

Sound familiar? Yes everything except the names.The cast is not to be faulted. Anthony Quinn plays the Greek tycoon to perfection and at least it's some consolation having just read that Ari himself requested Quinn for the role. Jacqueline Bisset is of course beautiful and sophisticated in the part of for all intents and purposes Jackie and James Franciscus has the all American good looks of the President.I haven't seen this movie since it came out nor do I wish to see it again. I seem to recall a fair bit of bad language and some general crudeness. Otherwise I suppose it's a sensational and supposedly intimate glimpse into the jet setting lives of the rich and famous frolicking aboard their yachts beaches pools etc. Yes the scenery of the Greek islands is spectacular the best part of the movie.Of its type it's okay I suppose. There are no end of TV movies about the Kennedys which I confess to occasionally tuning in to and not to my credit. This is basically just another.

Shortly later they both go to L.A. to find fame he as a rock star and her as an actress but when they run into each other again they have to decide whether their relationship is strong enough to withstand the business. Undiscovered was named by many as the worst film of 2005. I can't say I really agree with that. The movie is kind of weak but it's still tolerable and it's also pretty harmless. The premise is fairly interesting even if it's not very original. The execution is only average but still much better than expected. The romance is pretty weak though and just not very interesting. The two leads don't have enough chemistry to make the movie work. There are a few moments of intrigue and some nice performances but the end result is still unsatisfying. The reason the film is kind of lackluster is because of the writer and the director. John Galt wrote the screenplay and he fails to really add anything new to this movie. Also Meiert Avis just keeps everything by the numbers without adding any surprises.The acting is only okay with Carrie Fisher giving the best performance. She isn't given a lot of screen time but she still manages to give a few funny lines. Pell James is pretty good as Brier Tucket. She has that model look and she has an engaging quality that kept focusing my attention to her. Steven Strait is only okay as Luke. He's a little dull but he has that rock star look that suited the character. Ashlee Simpson plays Clea and she is actually only a supporting character in the movie. Her performance is surprisingly average like the film but she should stick to singing. Shannyn Sossamon was just annoying and not funny while Kip Pardue was only okay.I think the supporting characters really kept this movie moving. The scenes between Clea and Brier were pretty nice and engaging. Most of the characters were also pretty likable so the viewer at least cares for a happy ending. The ending was surprisingly good but very obvious. The music wasn't as painful as I was expecting it to be. I don't really like the type of music that was performed in the film but some of the songs were decent. Of course there were a few cheesy songs but they can't all be winners. I think the movie was unfairly bashed because of Ashlee Simpson's appearance. However she didn't bring down the movie and the film itself wasn't horrible. In the end Undiscovered isn't worth checking out but it's not a travesty either. Rating 510".

	schema:reviewBody "Undiscovered was a typical romance dramacomingofage film for 20something's with no backbone or intrigue. I watched it for Shannyn Sossamon because she's played these great characters in the past with very little going on in their lives but in this film she's this Brazilian modeltype who seems very much in the wrong film the character does anyways.I don't know what US Weekly was smoking when they proclaimed on the back of the DVD Ashlee Simpson shines as a punky inspiring singeractress. Simpson was basically playing a girl with no real depth and a horrible nasal voice. I do however believe in what the New York Post said about Pell James that she is adorable and winsome she's a romantic star in the making. She might be a notsowellknown actress but she was a well cast lead girl for this film. But the main dude Steven Strait is just a big baby with too much of his heart on his shoulder and his knack for writing lame songs in the movie just puts the character in the ground.I really only liked a few things about the movie. 1 Carrie Fisher. She hasn't been in a whole lot of films as of late so it was good to see her as a lead role in the modelactress' career. 2 The chick fight in the Viper Room scene. That's always killer. And 3 The small joke about the main singer guy having arachnophobia told by his agent at Tantra Records.The rest of the film has been done before by better actors. There was boring music which consisted of acoustic sets and U2 ripoff songs a ridiculous back and forth love story which makes you want to turn the DVD off ahead of time the dude acting like a baby through most of the film because he finds out that his contract was helped out by Brier the main girl and it wasn't because of his lame songs and there was even a ridiculous chant that the Tantra Records' associates go into after deleting this guy from the label. I really didn't get the line when she calls up this musician guy and adds I know. This is borderline stalking you. Hello? He's been obsessing about you the whole movie not the other way around.I had to give the film a 310. It was shot well but their was no driving force that kept my attention to the screen without reminding me of how much of a cable TV movie this is. I hope this was just made to give Ashlee Simpson a film career because if the writer really felt depth in this script I would start to lose hope in the future of film.".

This movie was obviously not meant to be some chromed rich kid glamor story about rock musicians. It's a picture of real life in the quest for fame and musical discovery which in final leans more to the side of musical creation than performing. Thus its setting has that raw quality of down to earth smelly club carpet intermixed with a glamor chase eventually resulting in neither but instead a down home one on one relationship with one's music and one's lover.The soundtrack is excellent the pop song composition is rich and the musical performers are 'tight'. Some of the AR record scouts are slimy which is not totally accurate in the real world but enough to get the point across in the movie that songwriting carries many more benefits than performing.".

	schema:headline " Sadly This film is undiscovered at the box office and there really isn't much about the film that needs to be discovered except Ashlee Simpson and Carrie Fisher.";
	schema:reviewBody "Undiscovered is the story about a group of people who move from New York to Los Angeles in order to jump start their careers. The movie focuses mainly on the lives of Luke Falcon Steven Strait who is struggling to become a singersongwriter and Brier Pell James who wants to become an actress. Undiscovered shows the things people go through in order to make their dreams come through along with the hard aches of love and friendship.I'm just going to cut to chase right away in this review and say this movie has been done before and has been done better. This movie really does live up to its title because a. it's basically a movie about lives of people who are undiscovered and b. it's a movie that will surely be undiscovered not only in the theaters but on DVD as well. The movie on the whole is rather average and sadly that's about it. I mean like I said this story has been done before and just when the film looks like it's going to move past it's average screenplay it just falls down and never makes it past that mark.The movie reminds me of two things the first thing it reminds me of is a really long music video and the second thing this film reminds me of is the TV show called Making the Video. The movie on the whole is like a mix of the two and nothing really else. The movie kind of falls in the same category of movies like Crossroads Honey and Glitter however in this case this movie isn't as laughably bad as Honey or Glitter because the acting and dialog really isn't that bad but like I said just horribly average.I have to give credit where credit is due and I must give Ashlee Simpson credit here. Now I know most of the United States for some odd reason hates Ashlee Simpson for whatever reason but I don't mind her. I think honestly she is the best thing to come out of this film because she was decent in it. And before anyone jumps the gun and says that I am just saying that because I am a fan that's a load of crap because I thought she was going to be awful in this movie from the get go and even laughed when I saw that she was in it. So that being said I really do think she was the best thing in the movie and did much better here then her sister Jessica did in the godawful Dukes of Hazzard. Also the other good thing about this movie was Carrie Fisher who along with Ashlee made this film somewhat enjoyable. The rest of the people in the movie aren't bad actors and I don't think they should be left undiscovered but they just were so average in their roles but that could be because of the screenplay.The director of this film Meiert Avis is best known for directing music videos for U2 and Bruce Springsteen and honestly I think he should stick to directing music videos because I didn't see much film work in this movie that I wouldn't see in music videos.In closing Undiscovered just doesn't have much to offer. If this was a made for TV movie it would be fine but the fact that people have to pay 5 10 to see this movie isn't going to go over well. While I didn't particularly enjoy much about the movie outside of Ashlee Simpson Carrie Fisher and the soundtrack I didn't feel like I hated this movie when I walked out of the theater. It's just very average and very unoriginal but it still had a few moments and things about it that made it a little enjoyable. I wouldn't recommend anyone paying money to see this film in the theater at regular price but maybe a rental would be a decent choice. This movie isn't the worst thing you could watch there are films far worse so if your in the video store a few months from now and you see Undiscovered sitting on the shelve pick it up and give it a shot.MovieManMenzel's final rating for Undiscovered is a 410".

While she definitely had a crucial part in the film it was not centered around her. With that said I could find nothing wrong with this movie and believe me I was looking. I thought there had to be a reason it was such a bomb in the box office but I could not find a single good reason. This movie was brilliant the story was sweet and romantic but not gushy it was surprisingly believable in its portrayal of struggling performers the acting was flawless and the music was out of this world. I even bought the soundtrack I was so impressed.

I guess that maybe its my taste that drove me away from this movie but I thought that the acting was not that great and Ashlee Simpson just didn't seem to fit for some reason. I found this movie boring mostly because the main character was just an average guy. A nice guy in fact. It was just like watching someone that I knew. Terrible. When I watch movies I want action horror fantasy things that don't happen every day.".

The plot has been done before yes but it's still worth seeing.Most of the acting was good. Steven Strait was amazing seeing as he is only 19. Amazing voice as well the soundtrack is a must have. Ashlee Simpson was alright she didn't show emotions very well but she was just a sidekick character. Carrie Fisher and Kip Pardue were nice comicadding characters I fell in love with Pardue immediately. The skateboarding dog was pretty neat. And Pell James was alright. She isn't really leading lady role material she looked rather uncertain when she was acting. But the Brazillian chick kept loosing her accent which was kind of odd. And the Austrailian boyfriend was pretty funny.Best thing in this movie is the music. Even Ashlee Simpson's songs weren't that bad. Steven Strait sings most of the songs on the soundtrack and they are really good.The directing was total crap though. Editing sucked. The whole plot itself wasn't really thoughtout like it could have been.So it's not an overly great movie but there are some nice faces to look at some good acting some comedy romance and some awesome music so it's worth it.".

	schema:headline " The alternate universe version of this film is probably pretty good";
	schema:reviewBody "When this movie is good it has all the depth and substance of a chewing gum commercial. When it's bad it's still as shallow as a puddle of tears in the desert while also being dumb clichd and just plain lazy. When Undiscovered begins it seems like it's going to be a story about the attractive underclass of Los Angeles the models who want to be actors musicians who want to be rock stars and the people who just want to have a good time. It's inconsequential but slightly engaging with good chemistry among the pretty cast. Then all that modest charm is ground away by a boymeetsgirl boylosesgirl plot that is so halfhearted it basically commits narrative suicide.Luke Falcon Steven Strait is a struggling musician. Brier Tucket Pell James is a model. They have a cute encounter in New York City and then meet again a year later in LA where Luke is an even more struggling club singer and Brier is trying to make the stereotypical leap from modeling to acting. Even though they're clearly attracted to each other Brier doesn't want to get involved with Luke for reasons that are so selfevidently stupid that the movie barely references them. Instead Brier and her new best friend Clea Ashlee Simpson conspire to boost Luke's music career by generating some underground buzz about it.That inexplicably works and Luke is picked up by graceless record executive Garrett Schweck Fisher Stevens. He remakes Luke into an altrock singer who looks like a cross of Danzig and Jim Morrison. Luke starts hanging out with Josie Shannyn Sossamon a character that makes absolutely no sense within the confines of the story and whose accent veers from Brazilian to Eastern European to New Jersey. Eventually Luke's star crashes to Earth as inexplicably as it rose in the first place at which point the film suddenly remembers the whole Luke loves Brier thing and wraps up with a conclusion so predictable it's actually mentioned in the writings of Nostradamus.Also hanging around the story are Brier's New York agent Carrie Carrie Fisher and Luke's brother Euan Kip Pardue who's only notable by acting like a white Bootsie Collins and doing the world's slowest job of packing a suitcase. I have no idea why either of these characters are in this movie but they're pleasant and inoffensive.As long as Undiscovered is focused on this group of characters just dicking around and not really doing anything it's nicely watchable. Steven Strait is nothing but a sack of meat with a halfFabio hairdo that gets pulled back into bun and not a douchebag ponytail but Pell James is beautiful and inviting even when Brier is a frustrating twit and Ashlee Simpson and her old nose are quirkily cute. Put them together and they have a fun and youthful ease about them that's both relaxing and amusing.However every single time Undiscovered attempts to tells its intended story the result is disastrous. What isn't stupid is illogical and what isn't stupid and illogical manages to be both insultingly obvious and awkwardly manipulative. It's a bit astounding how bad the storytelling becomes by the end of the movie.Undiscovered is one of those films where you can tell that something went very wrong at some point in the process and decisions were made that ruined whatever potential the production ever had. In an alternate universe all those movie turn out great. Unfortunately this reality's flawed and disappointing version of Undiscovered is all we've got.".

	schema:headline " It's like sitting on an atom bomb that's about to explode";
	schema:reviewBody "I have now seen Mr. Tommy Wiseau's cinematic tourdeforce 'The Room'  three times. With each viewing 'The Room' becomes more complexly  entangled in and inseparable from my own life. I no longer know where  The Room ends and I begin.  It is without question the worst film ever made. But this comment is in no way meant to be discouraging.  Because while The Room is the worst movie ever made it is also the  greatest way to spend a blisteringly fast 100 minutes in the dark.  Simply put 'The Room' will change your life.  It's not just the dreadful acting or the subnormal screenplay or the  bewildering direction or the musical score so soaked in melodrama that  you will throw up on yourself or the lunaticmaking cinematography no  there is something so magically wrong with this movie that it can only  be the product of divine intervention. If you took the greatest  filmmakers in history and gave them all the task of purposefully  creating a film as spectacularly horrible as this not one of them with  all their knowledge and skill could make anything that could even be  considered as a contender. Not one line or scene would rival any moment  in The Room.  The centerpiece of this filmic holocaust is Mr. Tommy Wiseau himself.  Without him it would still be the worst movie ever made but with him  it is the greatest worst movie ever made. Tommy has been described as a  Cajun a Croatian cyborg possibly from Belgium clearly a product of  Denmark or maybe even not from this world or dimension. All of these  things are true at any one moment. He is a tantalizing mystery stuffed  inside an enigma wrapped in bacon and smothered in cheese. You will  fall in love with this man even as you are repelled by him from the  first moment he steps onto screen with his long Louis the Fourteenth  style black locks and thick triangular shoulders packed into an oddly  fitting suit and his metallic steroid destroyed skin. Tommy looks out  of place out of time and out of this world. There has never been  anything else like him. Nor will there ever be.  The Room begins with 'Johnny' Tommy Wiseau and his incomprehensibly  evil fiance 'Lisa' played by a woman with incongruously colored  eyebrows and a propensity for removing her shirt engaging in some  light frottage joined by Denny played with a deft sense of the  absurd by Phillip Haldiman their sexually confused teenage neighbor  who is clearly suffering from a form of aged decrepitude. When Denny  who looks like the human version of Gleek the monkey from Superfriends  says in a slightly creepy yet playful tone of voice 'I like to  watch!' as Johnny and Lisa roll around the bed in a preintercourse  ritual revolving around rose petals you know you are in for a very  special movie.  After a lengthy lovemaking scene not to worry if you miss it the first  time they show it again in its entirety later in the movie in which  Tommy's bizarre scaly torso and overanatomized rearend are lovingly  depicted over and over again as he appears to hump Lisa's hip we  discover that Lisa for no particular reason has become bored with  Tommy's incessant lovemaking and decides to leave him.  Just when you think the movie might lapse into an ordinary pedestrian  sort of badness Johnny's best friend Mark a man who's job seems to be  to wear James Brolin's beard from Amityville Horror shows up and  electrifies the screen with a performance so wooden that it belongs in  the lumber section of Home Depot. Incidentally Mark is played by Greg  Sestero who in addition to being described as a department store  mannequin was also the line producer on 'The Room' and one of Tommy  Wiseau's five 5!!!!! assistants on the movie. Lisa forces Mark amid  his paltry unconvincing protests to have an affair with her on their  uncomfortable circular stairs. For no apparent reason Lisa decides that  she is made of pure evil and wants to torture her angelic and insanely  devoted fianc Johnny.  Lisa receives pointed advice from her mother who casually announces  that she is dying of breast cancer and then never mentions it again.  But Lisa is determined to make Johnny's life a living hell in spite of  the fact that she according to her mother cannot survive on her own  in the cutthroat 'computer business'. But not before they recycle the  sex scene from earlier in the movie where we get another bird's eye  view of Johnny's ludicrous naked body. Denny gets into trouble with a  drug dealer. Mark shaves his beard. Tommy gets drunk on an unusual  cocktail made from mixing whiskey and vodka. Lisa lies and tells  everyone that Tommy hit her in a drunken rage.  A balding psychologist appears out of nowhere offers some advice then  apparently dies while softly falling on the ground in an attempt to  catch a football thrown by Mark.  All of these seemingly disparate events build up to two cathartic  moments. The first is when Tommy expressively yells at Lisa with the  line 'You are tearing me apart Lisa!'. You will cheer at this line as  you realize that the film has been tearing you apart the whole time.  And the second is at Tommy's birthday party where the worst actor that  has ever been born plays a unidentified man wearing a silk shirt who  utters a phrase that perfectly describes the experience of watching The  Room  'It feels like I'm sitting on atom bomb that is going to explode!'  The shocking ending will leave you pleading for some kind of sequel.  See this film at all costs. See it twice. Or three times. Or as one kid  that I met from Woodland Hills has 12 times! See it until you can  recite every precious line of dialogue this movie has to offer. Let The  Room become your new religion and Tommy Wiseau your prophet preaching  the gospel according to Johnny.  My dream is to someday buy a theater and run The Room 24 hours a day 7  days a week until the print disintegrates. I hope it becomes your dream  as well.".

My dream is to someday buy a theater and run The Room 24 hours a day 7  days a week until the print disintegrates. I hope it becomes your dream  as well.";

Unintentionally inept characters engage in progressively bizarre and unnatural interactions which seem to peak at erratic and unexpected intervals.

It's kind of like watching a train crash in slow motion  random incoherent disastrous accidental and ultimately painful. The sense of alienation emanating from this film places the audience extremely far from being able to relate to what's happening on screen which leaves a lot of room for uncontrollable laughter given the right circumstances.The camera work and production techniques would not be out of place in many daytime soap operas nor would the script and plot but there is an undefinable quality which separates this movie from the sense mediocrity often found in such shows and instead casts it deep into the abyss of tragically bad film making where it will be forever trapped along with Wiseau's artistic integrity. This really is a new frontier.It is truly awful but I cannot recommend it enough.".

	schema:reviewBody "OK that may be a stretch but I have inside knowledge into the facts. You see I was fortunate enough to have worked on the film. As I read the reviews here especially the last one which I am sure was written by our amazing DirectorActorProducerWriter I felt I had to respond. Having the dubious honor of saying I worked on this film has also brought with it the responsibility of telling the truth about what happened on set. Apparently Tommy had a lot of money sitting around and decided he needed to make a film. Not being able to decide what to shoot film or video we shot both. Side by side. Both cameras on the same head being operated by one camera operator. We shot almost the whole thing in the parking lot and back storage shed read sound stage of a camera rental house in Hollywood. I got the call to work on the show after they had already tried to start with another crew that ended up all being dismissed. I believe that we ended up being crew 2 of 4. The show never had much organization to it from the start. We were told it would be a 3 week shoot. At the end of 3 weeks we were exactly 12 way done. Crew calls were usually 8 a.m. tommy would show up around 1030 or 11. Because he would take the HD video camera home with him every night we had no choice but to wait for him. Since we were only in one room or outside the door in the parking lot we did not have anything to do but sit around and wait every day. When Tommy arrived we would have to see if he was in actor mode or director mode. If he was in actor mode you were not allowed to talk to him so he could stay in character. Since he was in almost every scene he was always in his actor mode. This also meant that he could not direct. Noting the huge delays every day and the fact that we were never seeming to get anything done our wonderful script supervisor stepped up and became the director...at least he tried. One day he had to go off and do another show and asked if anyone else wanted to step up and direct and keep some script notes. When nobody volunteered I stepped up. I loved it. It was my directorial genius that had tommy bump into Lisa as they were taking the bad guy off the roof! I will also take credit for the now famous line You are tearing me apart Lisa! In the first 10 takes tommy kept saying You are TAKING me apart! As the crew tried to keep it together I felt I should right the situation and corrected the line. The crew was also instrumental in keeping the chicken line in. CHEEEEEPPPPPPP CHEEP CHEEP CHEEP CHEEP! We begged our scriptydirector to keep him doing it take after take. Though the crew ultimately followed the original DP out the door and quit we are all proud to have taken part in the making of this film. Amongst the film crew realms we are minor celebrities. Dude you worked on that thing? is a phrase that is often heard when The Room is mentioned.I have the pleasure of driving through Hollywood every day and still seei ng the billboard for the film up and Tommy glaring at me as if to say I telled you I could make movie. For those looking for a photo op it's on Highland a few blocks south of Sunset. I know that tommy took out an ad in the trade papers asking For Your Consideration I only wished that I could see him on stage accepting an Academy Award. It would be well earned. Rumor has it that he has a vampire film in the works... let's hope so... I only hope I get the opportunity to work on it. I can only hope that The Room becomes a cult classic with midnight showings. I'll put my tux on and bring a football. Perhaps I'll stand up for a QA afterward and tell the stories I have so fondly tried to burn from my memory. My other dream is for the DVD. There are 100's of hours of behind the scenes footage out there. The camera for the behind the scenes material was always recording. ALWAYS! It will be awesome to see what took place on our set. I hope he puts it out there. I know I would buy several copies for all my friends and family.Any questions?".

And he's also about to get married to Lisa who's in some computer business of some kind but she's having an affair with Mark Johnny's best friend who does not want to hurt Johnny but clearly can't help himself. Danny Johnny and Lisa's young sexually confused neighbour who has problems of his own somewhat related to drugs and football fetching doesn't suspect a thing although he's always hovering about and is also in love with Lisa but would rather watch Lisa and Johnny in bed when he's not fetching Johnny's balls. The only person who knows what is afoot between Johnny and Lisa is Lisa's mother who begs her daughter to come to her senses but in vain since no one listens to her and... she's dying... since she DEFINITELY has breast cancer which is okay since they're curing people everyday. Confused? Well don't be...And welcome to the wondrous world of The Room. This is a world from the breathtaking lack of imagination of Tommy Wiseau the least appealing man ever to walk this Earth a world where people play football in tuxedo have the same conversations again and again due to their 5 minutes memory make babies by humping belly buttons in the middle of rose petals and finally enter and exit places without any other reason than to do just that.Indeed this is probably one of the worst film ever made but as opposed to any other cinematic turd this one is hardly ever dull except for the sex scenes maybe the aimless plot driven through one stupidity to the other by the onpar grammarschool writing delivering gems galore I'm so happy I have you as my best friend and I love Lisa so much I'm tired. I'm wasted. I love you darling the final broth served by inept performances for want of a better word from its cast. This is truly the most inspired disaster ever committed to screen.But what I find the most interesting about the The Room is its maker Tommy Wiseau. The Room is a window into his confused psyche because make no mistake folks Tommy IS Johnny. And what are we told about Johnny? Well that he's very caring about the people in his life provides for his girlfriend is very sensitive doesn't drink has a very secure situation and has nice pecs. Quite a catch wouldn't you say ladies? On paper possibly... Because everything about his persona seems phoney his accent which is a mix of anyone's that ever walk this planet whom couldn't speak English his oversized suit his dark long and way too greasy hair his geriatric body posture his reshaped and remuddled face and above all his completely dry and humourless laughter and not in a sarcastic way either. Such a penchant for dissimulation is downright creepy and I must admit the physical repulsion he exerts on me is the stuff fascination is made of.The fact that The Room has gathered such a cult following is no surprise. In the ohso jaded times we're living in celebrating the mediocre talentless and pointless have become all the rage with the recipient of the mockery confusing infamy with fame. There is something both pathetic and a little unsettling about how Tommy Wiseau regards the cynical interests his movie has attracted for a genuine recognition of his talent.Mind you I suppose Mr Wiseau can take pride in the fact that The Room will go down in Cinema history. But as what?".

In the ohso jaded times we're living in celebrating the mediocre talentless and pointless have become all the rage with the recipient of the mockery confusing infamy with fame. There is something both pathetic and a little unsettling about how Tommy Wiseau regards the cynical interests his movie has attracted for a genuine recognition of his talent.Mind you I suppose Mr Wiseau can take pride in the fact that The Room will go down in Cinema history. But as what?";

	schema:reviewBody "Tommy Wiseau ranks among the greats Spielberg Scorcese Griffith  Welles.  In THE ROOM he has created a piece of cinema that has no parallels.  It is a unique piece of artistic greatness.Let's first discuss Mr. Wiseau's expert crafting of dramatic tension. Denny the slightly mentally retarded 20yearold wants to watch Johnny and Lisa make sweet love.  Denny also frequently acts like a braindamaged Golden Retriever in that he continually wants to play catch with a football even though everyone only stands 6 feet apart.   Denny eventually gets involved with drugs and has to confront the hatefilled ChrisR and there is no logical reason why the character has a hyphen in his name so don't ask.  Johnny nobly comes out of nowhere to provide Denny salvation and then this plot point is totally forgotten.The best part of the movie is Mr. Wiseau's acting.  He is leagues ahead of other contemporary actors.  He is on par with DeNiro in Raging Bull Nicholson in Easy Rider and Brando in Streetcar.  He delivers his lines as if he IS Johnny the AllAmerican guy who is trying to stay on the wagon and can't get that promotion at work.  He clearly has been welltrained in Method Acting.  His CroatianSerbianNorwegianKlingonMongolianYugoslavian accent is barely noticeable when he delivers lines such as You're tearing me apart Lisa' and I treat you like a princess but you stab me in the back.'  You feel Johnny's pain as he becomes a regular MacGyver and hooks up a tape recorder that is able to record for 24 hours straight.  His laugh hahaha comes off as natural as can be.  When you think JOHNNY you think AllAmerican guy.  The fact that Mr. Wiseau is over sixty years of age and may be on some kind of horse tranquilizer for much of the movie is not an issue.In the trailers for THE ROOM it is mentioned that Mr. Wiseau's directing and writing evoke Tennessee Williams and a truer statement has never been made.  You can feel the passion when Johnny transforms himself into Frankenstein and proceeds to destroy his room moving at a very slow speed. It is as if he is saying to the viewer Stella!!' except Mr. Wiseau does not need to say it verbally.  He says it through his emaciated skin which has seen better days and through his jetblack hair which is clearly his natural color.  Even though the Room takes place in San Francisco it is as if Blanche DuBois is saying to us Johnny you are a real American because you play football and say chchchicken.'On the musical front the shifting from a mysterious moody orchestral score to straightup RB ably shows Mr. Wiseau's ability to blend different styles musically in order to create a unified mood in his movie.  On the sound front the boom operator clearly did an excellent job as half of the lines in the beginning of the movie are dubbed in later even though the filming takes place in a quiet room with no extraneous noise.With regards to editing Mr. Wiseau deftly uses cutaways to 30secondlong shots from different vantage points in San Francisco.  He seems to be saying to the viewer I hope you weren't interested in the dialogue because now you will have to sit through 30 seconds of the same shot of the Golden Gate Bridge you've seen 10 times already before we get back to the dramatic tension you were longing for.Other attention to detail includes varying dates on how long Johnny and Lisa have been together 5 or 7 years the switching from the day shots to night shots and then back to day shots on the same day the fact that all of the men are dressed in tuxedos and decide to play football even though there is no justification for why they should be dressed in tuxedos and using the exact same shots in the second love scene between Johnny and Lisa that are also used in the first love scene.Overall Mr. Wiseau has proven himself to be among the toprank writers directors actors editors gaffers love maker action stars and best boys of his generation.  He has shown the ability to take any aspect of filmmaking and transcend it.  He is able to take monkey poop and turn it into a wellpolished turd.  I hope to see many more films from Mr. Wiseau in the near future and I hope that all of them will have Mr. Wiseau acting as well as new and better performances from the guy that played Denny he rocks!!.  To Mr. Wiseau I say L'Chaim and let's drink to much greater Cinema to come!!".

I would recommend that every person in the world find a way to see this film because it will leave you feeling that much better about yourself.  I mean that sincerely. So long as you have a great sense of humor and don't mind that the characters' only motivation for action is simply their illexplained personality traits I guarantee explosive laughter throughout the surprisingly quick hundred minutes.

I suppose I could tell you how I heard of it like most people I heard about this movie from an internet reviewerthe Nostalgia Critic. I honestly would've never heard of this film either probably would have never seen it. But after the clips I saw I HAD to see this movie I went on Amazon.com immediately afterwards and ordered it. Now I knew this movie was going to be bad but I HAD NO IDEA! I think it's one of those movies that had to be handled in clips because I cannot tell you all the safety precautions you should take before watching this movie. My boyfriend tried to commit suicide while I just wanted to find Tommy Wiseau and do some things that even the Dark One would look at me and say geez take it easy on the guy. I cannot even describe how this movie is bad. The acting is like the actors are literally reading the script for the first time. Tommy Wiseau's acting I don't know if there's a word for how bad it is so we'll just say it's aguwaba also it seems his voice was dubbed over. Now I thought this was because maybe he only speaks one language that isn't English but he speaks with this stupid indefinable accent all the time so why is his dubbing the same way? Where is he from? Brazil Romania France? I have no idea.Lisa has become inexplicably dissatisfied with her fianc Johnny confiding to her best friend Michelle and her mother Claudette that she finds him boring. Lisa seduces Johnny's best friend Mark and they begin an affair that continues throughout the film even as Mark more than once tries to break it off. As the wedding date approaches and Johnny's clout at his bank slips Lisa gets closer to leaving Johnny for Mark. When Lisa throws Johnny a surprise birthday party she flaunts her affair in front of Johnny and Johnny and Mark get into two altercations. Johnny has also attached a tape recorder to the telephone recording an intimate call between his future wife and Mark. Now that Johnny is fed up with this world feeling like he cannot trust anyone he pulls the ultimate punishment in self loathing to himself but a true gift to the audience.This movie is just incredible that it was made I didn't think it was possible to make a film so bad. It's like it's a new genre just a bad movie. Sub plots get brought up out of no where in this movie and never get brought up again. Characters get brought up and again never mentioned. The script story characters editing setting everything was just wrong with this movie. Also Tommy Wiseau's name is mentioned 6 times before the film even begins and his character is of course perfect that everyone should just love him. Lisa who is very odd looking is constantly called sexy which either has a new definition or is ironic. Mark is a doof ball that probably thinks that penguins are fish because he's just that stupid. Denny is a perverted 15 year old who wants to watch Johnny and Lisa make love and constantly says how in love with Lisa he is and how he loves Johnny. Also there is so many pointless love scenes football scenes gift giving scenes lines if there was a drinking game on the pointless scenes for this film you'd die of alcohol poisoning by the end of this movie. I don't know it is one of those films you have to see to believe but I can tell you one thing for sure if Tommy Wiseau thinks we're laughing with him he should check that we're actually laughing at him.110".

	schema:reviewBody "I did not hit her! It's not true! It's bullst! I did not hit her! I did NOTTT. Oh hi Mark.  Tommy Wiseau The Room Released in 2003 The Room would have faded into obscurity had it not like most of Ed Wood's films possessed the right mixture of sincerity godawful ineptness and unintentional humour. Within months the film had become a cult classic playing in packed Los Angeles theatres to legions of screaming fans.What makes the film hilarious is Tommy Wiseau a talentless and egotistical auteur who wrote directed produced financed and starred in this six million dollar flick. The classic selfimportant European artist Wiseau sees himself not only as a serious actor but a serious writer and director. He thinks he's written a Shakespearean plot when in reality this is a childish love triangle. He thinks his dialogue flies like Tennessee Williams but in reality it is worse than that offered by the Disney Channel. He thinks his direction rivals Cassavetes but in reality...well he was so confused he shot the film on both HD and celluloid cameras mounted side by side because he didn't know which camera was which.And yet there is something captivating about Wiseau's performance. His accent is odd he approaches each word from a strange angle he puts emphasis on the wrong syllables he structures sentences in off kilter rhythms he inserts punctuation in the wrong places and has his dialogue branch off in weird tangents. Listening to Wiseau speak is like watching the English language being reinvented. It should be god awful but it's strangely interesting. Like David Mamet his intonations his verbal tempo is almost balletic.Whilst all the actors in the film are bad  softcore porn bad  Wiseau imbues the film with a kind of transcendent badness. He's not bad so much as he is unaware of the rules of good. He's so earnest so confident that his performance that his art is the epitome of quality that his ineptness renders the whole production farcical.With regards to the film's plot there are themes of cancer betrayal drug abuse and infidelity but it's all handled in an awkward way akin to a kindergarten play. At times whole lines of dialogue are dubbed over often with no regard to the actor's lip movements. Like Ed Wood's Plan Nine From Outer Space characters are also oddly replaced by other actors half way through the film no explanation given. Throw in countless shots of the Golden Gate Bridge an epically stupid ending some hilariously badly written dialogue  Leave your stupid comment in your pocket! Chocolate is a symbol of love! What kind of money? I definitely have breast cancer I needed money so I bought drugs! I'm fed up of this wururld!  and you have the funniest so bad it's good film since Ed Wood.7.510  Comedy gold. Snippets from this film can be seen at the following linkshttpwww.youtube.comwatch?v7S9Ew3TIeVQhttpwww.youtube.comwatch?vmQ4KzClb1C4httpwww.youtube.comwatch?vLR1oG8JajM httpwww.youtube.comwatch?vPlzbhcHrychttpwww.youtube.comwatch?vCnnTqFTHGucAs you can see Wiseau's performance is strangely captivating. He has been described as Borat trying to do an impression of Christopher Walken playing a mental patient. How apt.".

Tommy Wiseau The Room Released in 2003 The Room would have faded into obscurity had it not like most of Ed Wood's films possessed the right mixture of sincerity godawful ineptness and unintentional humour. Within months the film had become a cult classic playing in packed Los Angeles theatres to legions of screaming fans.What makes the film hilarious is Tommy Wiseau a talentless and egotistical auteur who wrote directed produced financed and starred in this six million dollar flick. The classic selfimportant European artist Wiseau sees himself not only as a serious actor but a serious writer and director. He thinks he's written a Shakespearean plot when in reality this is a childish love triangle. He thinks his dialogue flies like Tennessee Williams but in reality it is worse than that offered by the Disney Channel. He thinks his direction rivals Cassavetes but in reality...well he was so confused he shot the film on both HD and celluloid cameras mounted side by side because he didn't know which camera was which.And yet there is something captivating about Wiseau's performance. His accent is odd he approaches each word from a strange angle he puts emphasis on the wrong syllables he structures sentences in off kilter rhythms he inserts punctuation in the wrong places and has his dialogue branch off in weird tangents. Listening to Wiseau speak is like watching the English language being reinvented. It should be god awful but it's strangely interesting. Like David Mamet his intonations his verbal tempo is almost balletic.Whilst all the actors in the film are bad  softcore porn bad  Wiseau imbues the film with a kind of transcendent badness. He's not bad so much as he is unaware of the rules of good. He's so earnest so confident that his performance that his art is the epitome of quality that his ineptness renders the whole production farcical.With regards to the film's plot there are themes of cancer betrayal drug abuse and infidelity but it's all handled in an awkward way akin to a kindergarten play. At times whole lines of dialogue are dubbed over often with no regard to the actor's lip movements. Like Ed Wood's Plan Nine From Outer Space characters are also oddly replaced by other actors half way through the film no explanation given. Throw in countless shots of the Golden Gate Bridge an epically stupid ending some hilariously badly written dialogue  Leave your stupid comment in your pocket! Chocolate is a symbol of love! What kind of money? I definitely have breast cancer I needed money so I bought drugs! I'm fed up of this wururld!  and you have the funniest so bad it's good film since Ed Wood.7.510  Comedy gold. Snippets from this film can be seen at the following linkshttpwww.youtube.comwatch?v7S9Ew3TIeVQhttpwww.youtube.comwatch?vmQ4KzClb1C4httpwww.youtube.comwatch?vLR1oG8JajM httpwww.youtube.comwatch?vPlzbhcHrychttpwww.youtube.comwatch?vCnnTqFTHGucAs you can see Wiseau's performance is strangely captivating. He has been described as Borat trying to do an impression of Christopher Walken playing a mental patient. How apt.";

You'll make yourself laugh as you quote choice lines Hi Doggy! I feel like I'm sitting on an atom bomb that's about to explode! The world would be a better place if everyone loved each other. Oh hi ! Chocolate is the symbol of love. Cheep cheep cheep! et al and mime Wiseau's hilariously awkward motions and slurred cadences It's not true I did not hit her! I DID NOOOOT.. You'll try in vain to convey the sheer weirdness of the incessant football playing the hilarity of the jogging at the park the brilliance of Chris R. the beautiful bluescreened rooftop the horrific sex scenes that never seem to end the mantralike gutwrenchingly saccharine pop songs that accompany said sex scenes and the inescapable minderasing voids of Lisa and Claudette's motherdaughter oneonone's. However frustratingly for the wouldbe promoter of the film these sorts of descriptions do little in the way of actually capturing the genuine magic that occurs when one sees The Room for the first time.After hearing about the film on NPR my interest was peaked. Soon after I discovered that there were several clips of the film available to view on Youtube. After watching the rooftop conversation between Johnny and Mark and an excerpt of the tuxedoclad football game I was sold. Living over 2000 miles from Los Angeles I knew my only option was to purchase the DVD which retails for about 11 on Amazon. Later that week I found myself staring at Wiseau's curiously droopy face and preparing at long last to watch The Room. Words fail to describe my experience I was immediately hooked. Now several months later I've watched the film close to ten times and I can say without hyperbole that it has become more fascinating and hilarious with each viewing. If you're reading this and you're on the fence about whether or not to go to a screening or to spend the 1115 for the DVD fear not  you will regret nothing. In fact you'll begin to wonder how you lived for so long without seeing The Room. Well what are you waiting for? DO YOU UNDERSTAND LIFE??!!".

It beats Plan 9 From Outer Space easily dethroning that movie from its former reign as The Worst Movie Ever Made.Words simply cannot effectively describe this movie and it's not worth any type of time or effort to attempt to seriously analyze it from a critical point of view. The movie is hopeless and utterly pointless literally every aspect of it is terrible. Only ridiculous hyperbole is appropriateJust imagine the best movie you've ever seen now imagine the complete opposite the total inverse of that movie in every aspect to hopefully visualize something even worse than the worst movie you've ever seen. Now imagine the worst movie you actually have seen. Pretend they mated the fictional inverse movie and the actual horrible movie and that their offspring was a premature abortion which only inherited the absolute worst negative qualities from its parents. Now take that failed abortion and imagine something ten times as horridly disturbing and terrible as it The Room is even worse than that.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is great. So complex so intricate so layered. A buddy of mine and myself could spend hours talking about this movie trying to figure it out. We've both watched it multiple times and we're both not satisfied. You thought the scene changes in Memento where confusing? Try The Room. You find yourself always wondering what the heck is going on. That's especially true when the actors are talking. Who wrote this stuff? Tommy Wiseau is who wrote this youngin'. Get to know him. Seriously. Wiseau not only made this movie he MAKES this movie. Without Wiseau you'd be wondering what the hell you're wasting your time for. With Wiseau somehow the movie makes perfect sense in a not making sense at all sort of way. Why is he always laughing? Is he nervous on the set? Is this the character of Johnny coming through? Who knows. This is why this movie is so great it leaves you with so many questions. For instance in the drunk scene you find yourself bewildered as to the reason Lisa and Johnny choose to drink what could only be described as Vodka over Whiskey. And then Johnny confirms that the drink Isss goood. How is that possible? You were confused by the time lapses in Primer? You ain't seen nothing. The Room not only has time issues but it has missing scenes and sudden changes of behavior by the characters. A simple filler shot of San Francisco Whenever you see Alcatraz I recommend shouting ALCATRAZ!!!!! can mean anything from Well it appears an entire day has passed... to Well I think it's the same day... or Why did I just see that?.So anyways here's my final take starting with the negativesThe Room suffers from too many sex scenes. The first one is hilarious and disgusting Does anyone know what's up with Wiseau's body?. After that the sex scenes are boring but still disgusting. The only good part is the original music which is hilarious and addicting. The Room also suffers from too many ClaudetteLisa scenes. These are really boring and the conversation is always the same... i.e. Lisa complaining about her relationship with Johnny. Peter is a lame character.And then the positivesAny scenes with the following characters are stellar Johnny Of course. Denny. Chris R They tease us with only one scene with Chris R. Doggy Again a one scene tease. Mike Watch his face. This movie is highly quotable. There are too many great quotes to even mention.The message of the movie How can you ever really trust anyone?.That's about it. Do yourself a favor and watch The Room. I only wish I lived near LA so I could attend a screening and meet Tommy or some of the cast.".

I owe everything to Tommy Wiseau. Every aspect of this film is flawless the character's are all lovable the set is believable the screenplay is phenomenal. The whole movie is a message to us all that love is blind. So please if you ever get the chance to see this masterpiece watch it. Then watch it again. Then think to yourself have I really been living my life without the words of Tommy Wiseau to guide me? Then watch it again.

	schema:reviewBody "At its base Bound for Glory is just a simple biopic about Woody Guthrie. In execution it turns out to be a lot more. We actually learn very little about Woody Guthrie's life. I don't know the exact statistic but I would guess that it covers no more than a few years with an end title that tells us briefly of his death. And basically all of the experiences shown onscreen can be seen in other films most notably John Ford's brilliant American masterpiece The Grapes of Wrath. To be absolutely fair the scenes of migrant workers' woes are at least equal to those in its predecessor. A good oneline summary of Bound for Glory might read a modernist equivalent of The Grapes of Wrath told from the point of view of folk singer Woody Guthrie. But Bound for Glory has a few things that make it stand out from other films that make it as memorable as The Grapes of Wrath.First and maybe foremost you have the brilliant and gorgeous cinematography of the great Haskell Wexler. I'm no expert on cinematographers but Wexler is one of only three I can name offhand the other two being if you are interested Vittorio de Sica and Sven Nykvist. I love Wexler's work in films like Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? and Matewan a thematically similar film directed by the great John Sayles. But what Bound for Glory most resembles is Wexler's very controversial cinematography on Days of Heaven. Not controversial because of anything specifically photographed of course but if you know the story a different cinematographer took credit as lead DP leaving Wexler with a credit that was something along the lines of with additional photography by. Wexler claims to have photographed more than 50 of the scenes in the finished film. He has sat through the film several times I have heard with a stopwatch. Bound for Glory at any rate is one of the most beautiful films you're ever likely to see. It's golden colors are beautiful and the camera is moved gently but with precision. This film actually has the first shot that used a steadicam although I had forgotten to keep an eye out for it when the film was playing I was far too engrossed. My favorite scene is one where Guthrie and a black hobo have left the boxcar of a train and move to the top of it. There they sit and converse as the most beautiful landscapes in our country pass by behind them. These are some of the best shots I've ever seen. And just because of those shots even if the film didn't contain a plethora of other relevant materials I would call this film one of the best ever made about the United States.Secondly and thirdly this film is about Woody Guthrie one of the greatest American artists of the past century. David Carradine who in other performances has never convinced me that he was as good as his father John who was in Grapes of Wrath incidentally or his brother Keith breaks apart my former opinion of him and delivers a masterful performance. I don't know whether I could identify why he is so good in this film. It's as if he has an aura about him. He really does however seem to enbody Guthrie's convictions. Throughout the film Guthrie's music is played whether sung or as an extradiagetic score. This is great American music. So much of it has become part of the soundtrack to the American life. I mean I remember learning songs like This Land is Your Land and This Train in elementary school music class. In his day Guthrie had difficulty in getting those kind of songs out to the public. His bosses were constantly ordering him to tone down the political edge of his music. Luckily for America he steadfastly refused to do so. Woody Guthrie was a true American hero. Bound for Glory depicts that as much as he could have hoped for.".

	schema:reviewBody "Of all the five best picture nominees of 1976 Bound for Glory is the most difficult for most to remember. I mean it was the quiet film in a year which consisted of Rocky Network All the President's Men and Taxi Driver. Woody Guthrie David Carradine of Kung Fu fame is suffering through the Dust Bowl of Pampa Texas in 1936. There are no jobs no crops and really no hope. Guthrie decides that the best way for him to do his part is to become a folk singer for the poorest peoples of Northern Texas and depressionera Oklahoma. What follows is a genuinely wonderful story which is all based upon the life of America's greatest folk singer. Bound for Glory is wellwritten welldirected by the wonderful Hal Ashby and wellacted by David Carradine in the role of a lifetime. Melinda Dillon Randy Quaid and Ronny Cox are among the other players but this is Carradine's show from the word go. A wonderful but truthfully somewhat forgotten masterpiece from the 1970s. 4.5 out of 5 stars.".

	schema:reviewBody "Is there any other musical figure in history who can be called as heroic as Woody Guthrie? The man was a musical genius a visionary songwriter and a great man a man who never gave up on his dream a man who gave up a lot of money so he could take his songs to the people the people the songs were written by and for in the first place. Woody Guthrie was integrity personified a great American hero. Bound for Glory is quite appropriately one of the greatest American films of all time as well as one of the most criminally overlooked despite two Academy Awards for cinematography and score and four more nominations including 'Best Picture' losing in that category to Rocky.Astonishingly accomplished cinematography from legend Haskell Wexler as well as some great editing and a stunning score in addition to Hal Ashby's Harold and Maude excellent direction make this a beautiful haunting and brilliant film. The performances carry the film with David Carradine turning in what is surely his greatest ever performance a stunning passionate beautiful portrayal of Guthrie which fully captures the man's spirit. Ronny Cox and Melinda Dillon are also superb in their roles. Ashby gets a sort of realism from his actors that is sorely missed today and any other method of portrayal would make this film far less captivating and beautiful than it is. Screenwriter Robert Getchell adapts his script very well from Guthrie's autobiography choosing the correct parts to tell. In many senses this feels less like a biopic and more like a story about working class America. Maybe that's why this is probably the greatest biopic of all time. In terms of technical accomplishment this is easily among the top 100 films of all time. It's a great American film about a great American hero. It tells the story of not only Guthrie but also those who surrounded him and the people he sung to. It's a beautiful emotional and arresting film that is surely essential viewing. One of the most criminally overlooked films of all time. A resounding 1010".

	schema:headline " Integrity personified....";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is about a guy who had integrity. He couldn't be bought off. He didn't sell out. Woody Guthrie felt his music. It came from a sense of caring about people. As a film Bound for Glory does a tenstar job of conveying the spirit of a man who could joke when the chips were down and who could sing out with an affection his listeners could believe. Guthrie made music move people to see themselves as worthwhile as creators of vitality gusto and dignity. And he did this during the Great Depression. People especially people in the industrial world feel less and less a sense of connectedness to each other. Community tends to lose quality as the rule of quantitative cheapness triumphs. The more the narrow modern sort of individualism envelops them the more humans slip into an alienation reinforced by commodified cocoons. Wageslaves we are and wageslaves we were in the 1930s. Only back then we still had some remnant of solidarity some spark of humanity to touch each other with. We still do but it's fading fast. Woody's life was about fanning those embers into flames as people worked for wages while others the unemployed and under paid caught up in the depression of the Great Depression wondered whether their families and other families like them would ever make it. Woody came from them and he sang for them. Woody was a working class hero a modern day troubadour. He infused his listeners with his humorous never giveup gumption which if you weren't lucky enough to know him personally came out in waves as you drank in his warm words and tunes. Woody made them feel that maybe they could be bound for glory!If you find this movie on the rental shelf pick it up and see it. It's great. I especially loved the scenes with Ozark Bule played by Ronnie Cox. He must have been something. The first time you see him he stands up on his vehicle near some unemployed field workers and sings the old IWW song composed by Joe Hill  Longhaired preachers come out every night Try to tell you what's wrong and what's right But when asked about something to eat They will answer in voices so sweet'You will eat by and by In that glorious land above the sky Work and pray live on hay  You'll get pie in the sky when you die'  that's a lie!And the Starvation Army they play And they sing and the clap and they pray Till they get all your coin on the drum Then they'll tell you when you're on the bum . . .Holy Rollers and Jumpers come out And they sing and they clap and they shout 'Give your money to Jesus' they say 'He will cure all diseases today . . .Working folks of all countries unite Side by side we for freedom will fight When the world and it's wealth we have gained To the grafters we'll sing this refrainYou will eat by and by When you've learned how to cook and how to fry Chop some wood it'll do you good Then you'll eat in the sweet by and by  that's no lie! And David Carradine Bill of Kill Bill fame would never do acting as fine as this again. His Guthrie is near perfect one level above Gary Cooper's portrayal of Sergeant York. Hal Ashby got the most from his acting company. They all look and act like real people with real lives not stars. And Haskell Wexler's camera work is as artistically brushed as Woody's best known songTHIS LAND IS YOUR LAND words and music by Woody GuthrieChorus This land is your land this land is my land From California to the New York Island From the redwood forest to the gulf stream waters This land was made for you and meAs I was walking a ribbon of highway I saw above me an endless skyway I saw below me a golden valley This land was made for you and meChorusI've roamed and rambled and I've followed my footsteps To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts And all around me a voice was sounding This land was made for you and meChorusThe sun comes shining as I was strolling The wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling The fog was lifting a voice come chanting This land was made for you and meChorusAs I was walkin'  I saw a sign there And that sign said  no tress passin' But on the other side .... it didn't say nothing! Now that side was made for you and me!ChorusIn the squares of the city  In the shadow of the steeple Near the relief office  I see my people And some are grumblin' and some are wonderin' If this land's still made for you and me".

	schema:headline " Great performance from...David Carradine!!??";
	schema:reviewBody "Bound For Glory is a very involving and interesting movie in a hypnotic slowmoving seventies kind of way. In fact for the first 45 minutes I was watching it on cable TV I had no idea why I was watching it. Nothing much was happening. The story was episodic and meandering. But I did watch the thing all the way throughall 2 and a half hours of it. In retrospect I can now see some reasons why the film held me so. To begin with the cinematography is beautiful and the music is wonderful. But mostly it was the acting which is uniformly excellent in a naturalistic way that is rarely seen these days. I had the impression I was peeking in on real people and events not on movie actors playing out a script. The biggest revelation however was David Carradine who gives an amazing performance as Woody Guthrie. He's just living the part. I meanwhat has the guy ever done before or since that even hinted at the fact that he could act so damn well? Nothing that's what! Carradine's performance in Bound for Glory reminds me of two other more recent performances in similar films Ashley Judd in Victor Nunez's Ruby in Paradise and Peter Fonda in the role that gave him an Oscar nomination Ulee's Gold also by Nunez.In these films you can see the main character thinking breathingliving. Not acting out some melodrama.Another common thread runs between these three performances too none of these actors have been allowed to or been able to? do work anywhere near as good again. The postRuby Judd has gone on to major in spunky thriller heroines and Fonda has drifted back off the map to wherever he was before Ulee.But Carradine is the one who really breaks your heart. He has continued acting like Judd. But the horrendous quality of his projects make you wish he'd disappeared back in to the vapor of obscurity like Fonda. After watching Bound For Glory the sight of Carradine zombiewalking through an episode of Kung Fu the Legend Continues or snarling like a braindead idiot in one of his Europeanmade directtovideo action cheapies is enough to make you cry. The massive talent he wasted.Still many actors never have even one moment of glory.".

I fear younger viewers who expect to have cars blowing up and a hero who can defeat a half dozen opponents at once will be disappointed. David Carradine turns in his best performance of all that I have seen. As others have mentioned the cinematography is fantastic. This movie is for those viewers who can appreciate that many have struggled and suffered to bring this country to the point where some can be bored by a movie of this caliber. To appreciate what we now have one must sit through the boring parts to see how badly people lived during this time in the USA. The movie does move slowly at times but that is how slowly the lives of people moved in that time period. They had little or no work didn't always know where their next meal would come from. VERY MINOR SPOILER The movie portrays Woody in his struggle to bring respect and equity to those who toiled and were abused. There are still those who do not believe that conditions like this once existed in this country. I doubt they would believe it if they watched the movie. I rate this movie 8 of 10 for the harsh portrayal of a time many are not aware of the convincing acting of Carradine and the cinematography.".

I rate this movie 8 of 10 for the harsh portrayal of a time many are not aware of the convincing acting of Carradine and the cinematography.";

We see the plight of working families moving to California and everything such. One of the best scenes is when a rich family picks up Woody. While they talk about their wealth and stuff Woody says something that I'm probably not allowed to write here.All in all this is a magnificent look into one man's life and into history in general.

	schema:reviewBody "An unusual film it starts by depicting the harsh life that many had to live during the Depression era but then about halfway through it takes a sharp turn to become a biography of a musician. This change is rather jarring as it comes unexpected. It manages to paint the glumness and the poverty of the Depression era so well that the sudden change in story direction just about violates what has gone before. In fairness it does give us an idea of what the protagonist went through and what motivated his career but is there not too much time spent on it? There is relatively little in the way of story until the music side enters in. It is quite meandering and full of characters that have no importance later on there is cause to wonder whether it could have been compressed down. For the adventure genre that the film best fits into it is also relatively unexciting. The film is rather awkwardly put together and it could do with a few events removed but there are still a lot of good points to it. The cinematography won the film an Academy Award as did the adapted music soundtrack and both these elements are good. Haskell Wexler has chosen some interesting angles to shoot the film from and the songs are fitted into the material quite well. Overall it is a good film but a difficult one too. It takes patience to get through but there are some good things in the end.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've seen lots of funny men in this world. Some will rob you with a sixgun and some will rob you with a fountain pen  Woody Guthrie Set during the Great Depression Hal Ashby's Bound for Glory follows folk singer Woody Guthrie as he evolves from a lowly sign painter in Texas to a popular radio singer in California. Guthrie's crosscountry journey was itself commonplace during the Dust Bowl years. This decades long period saw dust storms and droughts ravaging the American panhandle conditions which led to an exodus of farmers most of whom lost their land and travelled West eventually settling in California where they were ruthlessly exploited by land barons who pitted worker against worker.Like most of Ashby's lead characters Woody's thus a nonconformist with a strong sense of moral outrage. Ashby paints him as a wandering artist hopping from town to town riding trains hitching rides meeting folk and developing his conscience. It's not long before his songs become weapons a means to rally men against social injustice.And so as the film progresses Woody begins to inspire people to unionise and organise against farm barons and landlords and morphs into a kind of romantic anarchistsocialist figure who lives to fight and loves to sing.Like John Ford's Grapes of Wrath Bound for Glory's view of the Great Depression mixes inappropriately cosy postcard images with gut wrenching hardship. Families struggle to make ends meet food is scarce and jobs are few. But where Ashby and Ford differ most is in the latter's sense of optimism things will be better if only we keep singing. If only we keep chanting our guitars in hand. Ashy you sense is a bit more pessimistic. Understandable considering the era in which he was active.The title of Ashby's 1979 film Being There was perhaps inspired by German philosopher Martin Heidegger's magnum opus Being and Time. In his book Heidegger coined the term Dasein or Being there which referred to existence in the most minimal sense. By using the expression Being There Heidegger called attention to the fact that a human being cannot be taken into account except as a being existing in the middle of a larger fabric. To be human is to be fixed embedded and immersed in the physical literal tangible day to day. But Heidegger believed that certain people could escape this fabric or perhaps be more attuned to it via a heightened self reflexivity thought most were too preoccupied to do so.In Being There Ashby had actor Peter Sellers essentially play a brain damaged child called Chance. Depending upon one's reading of the film Chance's innocence either represented a kind of perceptual freedom which allowed him to unknowingly see beyond the delusive forms that mask everyday reality or the exact opposite Chance a figure of chance of lawless nonsensical irrationality. Regardless Bound for Glory's Guthrie is obviously intended to be juxtaposed with Chance. Gutherie's a simple man with few possessions and few ties. But while others are on their hands and knees working and toiling in the dirt Woody stands upright and sees the world both as it is and in terms of possibilities instead of limitations. Whever someone tries to force their frameworks upon him Woody rejects them marriage family job class money etc and goes in search of better paths. These path may not be visible or indeed even exist but what matters most is that Woody inspires others to join him on his search.8.510  Though Ashby fails to delve deeply into Guthrie's life preferring to reduce him to an archetypal wandering artist character this is nevertheless a fine era defining film and features some stunning cinematography by the legendary Haskell Wexler. Worth two viewings.".

This made just doing the movie an act of extreme courage on the part of everybody involved.The movie is as much about the depression in the 1930's as it is about Guthrie. Evoking the atmosphere of the 1930's Midwestern United States is what the movie does best. Bonnie and Clyde is really the only other movie that succeeds as well as this one.When I saw it thirtytwo years ago I thought it was beautiful but politically tepid downplaying much of the politics of Guthrie and the period. It seemed to also show Guthrie as inarticulate rash selfdestructive egocentric and foolish. Looking at it now the cinematography is not great some of it is quite grainy. It is fine but not brilliant.More importantly I appreciate now that it does not romanticize Guthrie. No doubt in the coming century he will become an icon like Che Guevara. One gets a vision of a real flawed and downtoearth person and not a whitewashed myth in Carradine's brooding portrayal. It hurts the drama but that is something I think Guthrie would have appreciated.Some have noted that David Carradine never did anything better. This is true. Still he has worked steadily as an actor now with over 200 movie and television roles. He is in no less than ten movies this year. If you include over 120 episodes of his two Kung Fu television series he has been in as many productions as his legendary father John Carradine 339. It is ironic that his father was best known for his role in Grapes of Wrath and he will be best known for his role in Bound for Glory Altogether this is a beautiful laidback easygoing version of the Woody Guthrie story. One expects that soon in the future a much more passionate version will appear.".

He blurts out The more you eat the more you st. Immediately Woody is hitchhiking once more. This one scene epitomizes Woody's attitude and character. He is the common man writ large no pretense no fabrication just plain talk.This movie is based on Woody's book Bound for Glory the title coming from the old spiritual This Train is Bound for Glory This Train. A popular song of the day was Born to Lose by the western swing band Ted Daffan's Texans much later a big hit for Ray Charles. Woody hated the words to the song with its pessimistic fatalistic outlook on life and love. Partly in response to this song Wood wrote his Bound for Glory. The book like the movie is a look inside Woody's mind. It's about his philosophy and how it relates to his music and songwriting. It is thereby not much of a biography dealing with a few episodes in Woody's odyssey across American and his rather brief career as a professional musician.All Woody's best songs are showcased in Bound for Glory. I Ain't Got No Home Talking Dust Bowl Blues So Long It's Been Good To Know Ya They Laid Jesus Christ in His Grave Howdjadoo Deportees Hard Travelin' Pastures of Plenty and his most recorded ditty This Land Is Your Land. About the only ones missing are Pretty Boy FloydVigilante Man and Take Me For a Ride In Your CarCar Riding In My Car. When one imagines an actor portraying Woody Preacher Casey John Carradine from The Grapes of Wrath comes to mind. In 1976 John Carradine would have been too old to fit the part. Why not his lookalike son David? A good choice. David Carradine not only acts the role much like George C. Scott in Patton he becomes Woody. Added to the believability is David's ability to play the guitar and harmonica and to sing in Woody's style. Modern ears have difficulty listening to the rough often grating primitive singing and playing of Woody. Woody wanted it that way. He desired to sound like the common man not like some radio crooner. The movie highlights this when a cocktail lounge singer is auditioning with I'm In The Mood For Love. Guthrie follows with a hillybilly rendition of Pastures of Plenty much more sophisticated than it appears to be. Caradine captures the sound perfectly without over playing it.Maverick director Hal Ashby and his cinematographer Haskell Wexler by studying Dorothea Lange's famous photos of the Great Depression and by utilizing inspiration gained from watching John Ford's The Grapes of Wrath are able to capture on film the essence of hopelessness frustration and misery of those caught in the maelstrom of starvation and unemployment. One telling scene has a horde of migrant workers slowly walking toward the camera their heads bent in quiet desperation having been rejected from fruitpicking work because only thirty hands were needed. In the midst of this swirl of despondency Woody walks tall against the flow his head in the air as much a maverick as Ashby. Only two other Hollywood films equal Bound for Glory in their depiction of the Great Depression on the big screen The Grapes of Wrath and Arthur Penn's Bonnie and Clyde.Even Woody's ambivalent attitude toward women is not glossed over. Woody was at heart a drifter unable to stay in one place too long always breaking free from the ties that bind. Keeping with this accurate presentation of the bard The film shows Woody's concept of labor unions as being for fair treatment of workers with a decent wage not the compromising fanaticism of Ozark Bule Ronny Cox demanding all or nothing until the chips are down then backing up on his principles. A similar outlook causes Woody problems with being a professional musician. When agents managers and producersall in it for the moneytry to groom Woody for the big time he throws his guitar over his shoulder and heads for New York Town where he would find People going' down to the ground Buildings going' up to the sky as Dylan would later sing in homage to his mentor.".

	schema:reviewBody "For realistic images of the 1930s dust bowl in Oklahoma and Texas this is the film to see ... the shabby frame houses the dilapidated autos the dreary clothes the grinding poverty and all that dust. Although the film was shot in color the lighting is muted even in daylight. I suspect that was on purpose to show how the dust blotted out much of the sunlight and thematically much of the optimism.Bound For Glory is the story of folksinger Woody Guthrie David Carradine whose life as a sign painter and hobo during tough times led him to write many songs the most famous being This Land Is Your Land. The story begins in Texas with Woody already married and with children. Eventually all that dust and dreariness causes him to forsake his wife and kids as he hitchhikes and rides the rails westward to the promised land.But the promised land doesn't want any more Okies. And Guthrie ends up eating in free soup kitchens and living in ugly migrant worker camps. He writes music about life as a poor man. He identifies with the problems of migrant workers stuck with poverty wages if they're lucky enough even to get a job. He and them resent the cruelty of their arrogant bosses and rich powerful corporations which leads him to write songs of protest.Despite the film's lengthy runtime only a small part of Guthrie's life is shown here. We never learn anything about him once he becomes famous. Nor do we learn anything about his upbringing in rural Oklahoma. The film is more of a yearinthelifeof rather than a comprehensive bio.Bound For Glory looks good visually with terrific period piece production design and costumes. And the cinematography is impressive. But the plot pace is very very slow and deliberate. Everything is understated. And not until the film's end do we get to hear his most famous song. David Carradine is reasonably persuasive as Guthrie. Other performances are fairly standard.For all the great visuals the script is somewhat of a letdown. I would have preferred a more conventional biography with a faster clip. As is genuinely certified fans of Woody Guthrie are the only viewers likely to have the patience and forbearance to sit through this toilsome and sluggish though realistic story.".

He liked recognition from time to time and to be able to get his voice out to as many people as he could. But and this is from the looks of the film and from what else has come up about Guthrie he never sold out. He wasn't a political figure but his songs had that driving force of politics of something inspirational that couldn't be reached through typical rhetoric. When Guthrie goes through the fields of workers picking artichokes or workers at a factory and he goes on and on singing his protest songs until the bosses beat him up and wreck his guitar it's about as close as a political act as one has ever seen a singermusician in a basedonatruestory picture. But at the same time Hal Ashby isn't out to make an entirely explicit 'message' heavy movie even if there is of course messages to be taken to heart.It's about the man himself and the times and circumstances that drove Woody Guthrie on his own apart from his family in mid 1930s depression era America. One could look at the film as an examination of a man caught in such dire times of a country where the line between rich and poor was so significant there was barely any middle ground. But one can also look at it as the story of a wanderer someone who as his protge Bob Dylan would later make as his proclamation in Like a Rolling Stone with no direction home always felt a little restless. His journey is what really counts and shapes his music and outlook. It almost comes close to what it must be to have faith if you want to sing just sing as Guthrie tells a bunch of kids a little simplistic but with a kernel of truth no matter what it's about. To suddenly find more meaning in the songs from the circumstances becomes part of the narrative of a man who could be a hero in the historical sense while not being the kind of man who would be entirely one to aspire to be. He's happy to just walk down a road and sing his songs for anyone who will hear as his family leaves him behind and any chance of conventional success floats by the wayside.It's hard not to make messages in a film where its character in real life once had the ultimate fyou to the establishment right on his guitar case This machine kills fascists. But it's the high skill of filmmaking and the performance at the lead that enrich what is already potent awesome material. Haskell Wexler the lategreat cinematographer behind Cuckoo's Nest and Medium Cool puts his stamp significantly as a work of Americana of the traditionalist sense a duststorm is like something both alien and beautiful while the train scenes are exciting lush with vibrancy with dirt all around. Ashby too has a mark here from his editing days there's not one transition from scene to scene that doesn't have a fade making it a step removed from the usual lot of films at the time even Ashby's where just a straight cutto or a jumpcut would suffice. He could've made this film in the technical sense twenty years before and it wouldn't of made much of a difference.And finally David Carradine. If Kill Bill is the guiltiest pleasure of his career Bound for Glory is his serious triumph as an actor. He's got that quality which may or may not have been like the real Guthrie that sucks a viewer in even when the character does something or says something that shouldn't feel like it's the thing to do as the protagonist of the story. He's a character led solely by his convictions and Carradine enriches that through the performances of the songs and his own selfconfidence radiating just walking down a road or going to do something out of the goodness of his soul. From every moment he's on screen as if in some kind of folkrhythm mode out of Kungfu he's mesmerizing in a performance that should've been nominated along with De Niro Finch and Giannini in the best actor race albeit more lowkey than the others. Bound for Glory is a blissful epic of conscience and a kind of eccentric story a man who lacked any cynicism in his being. Plus of course the songs are great as they're played on the spot without any overdubbing.".

	schema:headline " So long. It's been good to know you.";
	schema:reviewBody "Bound for Glory is a very long but utterly engrossing musical biography about an entertainer worth getting to know. That man is Woody Guthrie David Carradine a sign painter from Pampa Texas during the Great Depression era. Determined to make some move away from his hardscrabble existence and plagued by a case of wanderlust he takes leave of his family and heads for California. This he did like so many other people of the period who believed that the West Coast held more promise. Inspired by a singer named Ozark Bule Ronny Cox he uses his musical talents to give voice to the scores of Americans who were struggling to get by.It's true that we don't learn a LOT about Guthrie in the course of this two and a half hour long film but it's still easy to get involved in the story. Which other than a scant few people consists mostly of fictional characters. It can boast some truly stylish and thoughtful filmmaking thanks to Oscar winning cinematographer Haskell Wexler screenwriter Robert Getchell adapting Guthries' autobiography and renowned director Hal Ashby. It does often look like a painting of this sad chapter in American history come to life. But it goes far on the spirit of its main character. Carradine giving the performance of his career makes Guthrie a good simple pleasant person who in the end is true to himself. Although he is able to make a good living performing for the radio he realizes that he has to sacrifice too much integrity in order to please greedmotivated sponsors. He tires of having to deal with people with their own agenda and gets on the bad side of authority figures who dislike his open support of unions.Carradine is extremely well supported by a rich gallery of familiar faces with meatier roles going to Cox as the likeable Ozark Melinda Dillon who plays both the singer Memphis Sue and Guthries' wife Mary Gail Strickland as a rich society type who helps to run a soup kitchen John Lehne as the disapproving radio boss JiTu Cumbuka as an upbeat hobo and Randy Quaid as the frustrated migrant worker Johnson. There's several other people you'll also recognize David Clennon Mary Kay Place M. Emmet Walsh Brion James James Hong Robert Ginty and Bernie Kopell in an uncredited cameo as Baker the agent.The soundtrack is of course wonderful with a superb assortment of Guthrie tunes film composer Leonard Rosenman also won an Oscar for adapting Guthries' music into film score.Ultimately this is an uplifting story it may have some down sides along the way but it endears itself to us the way that it portrays this entertainer who truly wanted to represent the American people.Eight out of 10.".

That man is Woody Guthrie David Carradine a sign painter from Pampa Texas during the Great Depression era. Determined to make some move away from his hardscrabble existence and plagued by a case of wanderlust he takes leave of his family and heads for California. This he did like so many other people of the period who believed that the West Coast held more promise. Inspired by a singer named Ozark Bule Ronny Cox he uses his musical talents to give voice to the scores of Americans who were struggling to get by.It's true that we don't learn a LOT about Guthrie in the course of this two and a half hour long film but it's still easy to get involved in the story. Which other than a scant few people consists mostly of fictional characters. It can boast some truly stylish and thoughtful filmmaking thanks to Oscar winning cinematographer Haskell Wexler screenwriter Robert Getchell adapting Guthries' autobiography and renowned director Hal Ashby. It does often look like a painting of this sad chapter in American history come to life. But it goes far on the spirit of its main character. Carradine giving the performance of his career makes Guthrie a good simple pleasant person who in the end is true to himself. Although he is able to make a good living performing for the radio he realizes that he has to sacrifice too much integrity in order to please greedmotivated sponsors. He tires of having to deal with people with their own agenda and gets on the bad side of authority figures who dislike his open support of unions.Carradine is extremely well supported by a rich gallery of familiar faces with meatier roles going to Cox as the likeable Ozark Melinda Dillon who plays both the singer Memphis Sue and Guthries' wife Mary Gail Strickland as a rich society type who helps to run a soup kitchen John Lehne as the disapproving radio boss JiTu Cumbuka as an upbeat hobo and Randy Quaid as the frustrated migrant worker Johnson. There's several other people you'll also recognize David Clennon Mary Kay Place M. Emmet Walsh Brion James James Hong Robert Ginty and Bernie Kopell in an uncredited cameo as Baker the agent.The soundtrack is of course wonderful with a superb assortment of Guthrie tunes film composer Leonard Rosenman also won an Oscar for adapting Guthries' music into film score.Ultimately this is an uplifting story it may have some down sides along the way but it endears itself to us the way that it portrays this entertainer who truly wanted to represent the American people.Eight out of 10.";

	schema:headline " Fictionalized Biography of Folk Hero Woodrow Wilson Guthrie";
	schema:reviewBody "It is 1936 in Pampa Texas during the oppressive Dust Bowl. Work is hardly available even for 24 yearold signpainter Woody Guthrie David Carradine who doesn't seem to mind as he spends time with his friends and singing and playing the guitar. Woody's first wife longsuffering Mary Melinda Dillon is most concerned about the lack of cash for the growing family two little girls thus far. After a dust storm strikes Woody simply packs up and heads for California where jobs are supposedly plentiful. He leaves a note for Mary Going to California. Will send for you all. Constantly struck with wanderlust as we shall see Woody is really a drifter. So Woody along with many hobos of the Great Depression hitchhikes and rides the rails on his journey. By the way this is the largest migration in US history. Along the way Woody lives in migrant worker camps and Hoovervilles. Along his travels he meets all kinds of characters including Slim Snedeger JiTu Cumbuka and unionizing folk singer Ozark Bule Ronny Cox. At a migrant camp Ozark and Woody sing and extort the workers to unionize until thugs arrive and break up the gathering. As Woody observes the miserable plight of many Americans his social conscience is so raised that he composes and sings many of his folk songs. Note the memorable scene atop a boxcar where Woody plunks away at his guitar while he composes the words to This Land Is Your Land. Later on there is another set where Woody waltzes into a factory and exhorts the workers to unionize he is promptly beaten up by security folks. Ozark Bule helps Woody to get a radio job at KTNS for twenty dollars a week. Most of the mail from listeners is positive and Woody and singing partner Memphis Sue Melinda Dillon again get an offer of thirtyfive dollars weekly. Station manager Locke John Lehne concerned about his new sponsors tells Woody not to sing any controversial songs. After all the sponsors pay for what they want to hear and they do not want provocative subject matter. But there really is no compromise for Woody. Note that this scene is really inaccurate as Woody was really advocating support of the Soviet Union. Then when Russia's Stalin signed the August 1939 nonaggression pact with Nazi Germany the leftists were stunned and . . . Oh never mind!An agent Baker Bernie Kopell plans on getting Woody an offer to play for CBS as long as his songs are not controversial. No thanks! And as there is no middle ground it is time for the detached Woody to move on. Ultimately Woody will work his way to New York where there are many people and unions who will hear the message of his music. Woody is destined to gain even greater acclaim than previously. The movie focus is on a slice of Woody's life 19361940 loosely based upon his 1943 autobiography. The famous folk singersongwriter and musician is flawed and neglectful of his family even after he relocates them to California. Although married he was a notorious womanizer. In his real life the detached Woody had three wives and seven children son Arlo was not born until 1947. But Woody inspired folks who had nothing except hope he said one's skin color is not important. Despite his defects he remained idealistic and gave up various monetary offers. Still he was not an easy man to live with. The songs performed by David Carradine include This Train Is Bound for Glory Talking Dust Bowl Blues I Ain't Got No Home and of course the famous This Land Is Your Land. The feature may be slowpaced but there are also impressive goldencolored cinematography and scenic views. There are also authentic and stunning period details like the shabby frame houses and jalopies. The acting is natural Carradine is very good as the folk singer who never surrenders his deeply felt convictions. In fact in this movie Carradine is Woody. Bound for Glory received an Oscar nomination for Best Picture but understandably lost out to Rocky a top 100 of all time movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "I find it quite surprising seeing that Cary Grant is one of my favourite actors that after nearly forty reviews on this site not one of them has been a Cary Grant film. How odd.I now intend to remedy that fact by posting a few as I do believe he was one of the most versatile performers and gifted comedy actors ever to hit our screens.My favourite Cary Grant comedy is 1937's The Awful Truth and it is an amazing tribute to his talent that in Father Goose made 27 years later he seems to have aged very little and has not lost one iota of the spark or zest that graced his performances throughout the decades.In his penultimate screen appearance Grant for once plays a character far removed from his immaculately dressed man about town persona as he takes on the role of Walter Eckland a south sea drifter complete with dirty slacks tennis shoes and beard. Life for Eckland is lived on his beloved boat drinking scotch and sailing from island to island meeting and fraternising with as fewer people as possible.However Eckland's idealistic lifestyle and the hull of his boat are severely destroyed with the arrival of Captain Trevor Howard of the Royal Navy. Bullied browbeaten bribed with Scotch Whiskey and with a large gaping hole in his boat he is forced onto a deserted pacific island to act as coast watcher for the Allies reporting Japanese ship and aeroplane activities with the RT codename of Mother Goose.Eckland's immediate plans are to repair his boat and escape his captivity and jumps at the chance to go and rescue a possible replacement from a nearby island. Using his boat's dinghy he braves rough seas and Japanese patrol vessels in order to obtain his freedom.However when he arrives at the island he finds the replacement dead and a prim and proper governess played by Leslie Caron in his stead. It is only after he agrees to take her off the island to safety that life goes from bad to worse as it appears she is not travelling alone but with seven schoolgirls.The interplay between GrantCaron and the kids is hilarious as the contrast of lifestyles between Walter and his reluctant family is immediately apparent and almost at once they become warring factions.She wastes no time in confiscating and hiding his liquor evicting him from his house and commandeering his clothes his tools his food and just about everything else she can get her hands on.Walter is more or less banished to his half submerged boat. A stranger in his own 'home'.None the less after near discovery by the Japanese Eckland acts heroically endearing him at last to the female inhabitants until eventually the 'rude drunken foul mouthed filthy beast' and 'Miss Goodietwoshoes' actually become rather 'pally'.The whole cast is excellent most notably Trevor Howard who really relishes this rare chance to take on a comedic role but what makes this film sensational is the clever writing.For example when the Navy is given the task of evacuating the newcomers the answer is a parachute drop A parachute drop? I want them picked up Frank not put down. Or when Grant is teaching Caron how to fish Quiet here she comes again..... How do you know it is a she? asks Caron..... Her mouth is open now be quiet.Very witty examples and this film is chockablock full of them. Check out the snakebite scene. It is quite amazing.I know this film has come under some heavy criticism over the years but I fail to see why. It is Cary Grant in one of his finest and funniest films. I suppose the bad reviews this film received was one of the reasons he retired shortly afterwards. It was classic Grant and one of his personal favourite performances but it failed to find a large or appreciative audience and I suppose out of all his films the failure of this one saddened him the most.".

Her mouth is open now be quiet.Very witty examples and this film is chockablock full of them. Check out the snakebite scene. It is quite amazing.I know this film has come under some heavy criticism over the years but I fail to see why. It is Cary Grant in one of his finest and funniest films. I suppose the bad reviews this film received was one of the reasons he retired shortly afterwards. It was classic Grant and one of his personal favourite performances but it failed to find a large or appreciative audience and I suppose out of all his films the failure of this one saddened him the most.";

	schema:reviewBody "This is vintage Cary Grant reminiscent of his earlier romantic comedies. He plays Walter Eckland a rough gruff unkempt loaner coerced into being a spotter for the Royal Navy on a remote Pacific island. He is forced to take in a teacher and her seven charges all female ranging in age from 5 to 14. Leslie Caron is excellent and funny as the teacher. She sets out to change Walter for the sake of the girls by pouring out all his whiskey. One of the best scenes in the film comes when Leslie Caron is supposedly bitten by a snake a stick and Walter gets her drunk to ease the pain of her dying. This is great comedy. This film is a MUST SEE for Grant fans. Rating 9.0".

	schema:reviewBody "If you are looking for comparisons and don't mind a bit of a stretch then you can consider Father Goose 1964 as another version of Bringing Up Baby. In both Cary Grant gets to play a character experiencing a host of aggravations. Leslie Caron's Catherine Frenau is not as zany as Hepburn's Susan but still manages to irritate Grant for most of the film until he finally realizes that he is in love with her. And instead of a leopard and a dog running amuck in rural Connecticut Father Goose features seven schoolgirls of various nationalities running amuck on a Pacific island during WWII. Everything works pretty well in this film although Grant is not quite up to an American accent so there are several awkward moments with the script. And the age difference makes the GrantCaron romance unconvincing. Fortunately the producers skate over the romantic elements. In fact the romance is treated so superficially that you wonder why they bothered to insert it into the story. A similar romance got much the same treatment that year in My Fair Lady.The film's real strength is the interaction between Grant and the seven schoolgirls as it manages a fair amount of believable characterization for each of them. The initially silent Jenny Sharyl Locke tomboy Harry Jennifer Berrington chronic complainer Anne Pip Sparke Elizabeth Stephanie Berrington and her imaginary friend Gretchen coming of age Christine Venina Greenlaw and the French twins Laurelle and Nichole Felsette. All have distinct personalities and it is obvious that Grant had a lot of fun working with each of them so much so that he stayed in touch with them even after they grew up married and started their own families. Grant's Walter Eckland is an American drifter hoping the war will just pass him by illustrated during the opening credits by Digby Wolfe singing Pass Me By as Eckland with an unwanted hitchhiking Pelican steers his boat into the harbor. The war catches up with him there when the Harbor Master Trevor Howard tricks him into taking a coastwatching job until a replacement can be found. His job is reporting by radio any movements by Japanese planes and ships near his island station. The reluctant recruit is rewarded with a bottle of whiskey previously hidden somewhere on the island by the Royal Navy each time one of his reports is confirmed.Walter seems to thrive on this assignment until he has to share his island with a French teacher Catherine Frenau Leslie Caron and seven young charges. Miss Frenau hides the remaining whiskey bottles and the females take over Walter's hut. Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.".

	schema:headline " Cary Grant as a South Sea Island Rat";
	schema:reviewBody "It was not quite what Cary Grant wanted but it was certainly different. In his whole career he wanted to play a negative role  a person who was not debonair or likable but a villain. At time he was defeated by his own agent and the production studio from being a wife killer SUSPICIONor a labor agitator suspected of arson murder THE TALK OF THE TOWN or he played a Cockney gadabout who confronts a mobster NONE BUT THE LONELY HEART or he played a gambler thinking of swindling a wartime tragedy MR. LUCKY or a suspected jewel thief TO CATCH A THIEF or a successful university professor who was targeted by a jealous rival PEOPLE WILL TALK. But while some of these parts approached the villain he wanted to play none hit the actual target. In 1964 Grant finally got a chance to undercut his sophisticated sharp dressing style. He got the chance to play South Sea island rat Walter Eckland a grizzled loner who has little use for the modern world and a large appetite for alcohol. The film was the film comedy FATHER GOOSE costarring Leslie Caron as Catherine Freneau the daughter of a French colonial governor and Trevor Howard as Commander Frank Houghton of the Royal Navy. Again Grant was cheated out of the full chance of playing a disreputable type. Eckland is disreputable he is first seen trying to steel gasoline supplies needed by the royal navy which is fleeing a threatened dockyard  for his own cabin cruiser. But by the time the film ends he is shown to be heroic.Fortunately it is a comedy with it's three leads playing well off each other. Grant is dragooned by Howard into being an island watcher for the British navy against Japanese planes and ships. To keep Grant from splitting Howard wrecks the cabin cruiser and he hides Grant's supply of alcohol. It works but a few months later Grant is informed he has to perform a rescue from another island across the sea. He only does it when Howard informs him where the rest of the alcohol is hidden. Then he goes only to find it is Caron and six little school girls left in her care when evacuating a French island. Almost immediately there is friction between Grant and Caron as to proper behavior in front of the girls and in serving the young ladies and Caron first. When they get back to Grant's island Caron has the young girls hide his liquor all over again.It has been suggested that Grant and Caron were playing roles similar to Humphrey Bogart and Katherine Hepburn in THE African QUEEN. Certainly in the relationship of Charlie and Rosie in that film there is a definite resemblance to that of Walter and Catherine. But this kind of opposite attracts appears before THE African QUEEN did. In VESSEL OF WRATH set in the South Seas in the 1930s the harddrinking Charles Laughton ran afoul of missionary Elsa Lanchester. As with the other two pairings they eventually fall in love.But the humor in FATHER GOOSE is Grant's attempts to maintain his control over the island even while thrown out of his hut by Caron and her charges. Every time he tries to show who is boss he's undercut by the ladies. Howard although at a distance is no real help  the war is of first importance to Allied planning not rescuing angry drunken island rats. It is only when Grant shows that he can fish but Caron cannot that he starts reducing her ascendancy over him and the capoff is when he believes she is dying of snake poison and she is made comfortable by large cups of Grant's booze in a coconut cup. With her hair down she suddenly is not so inhumane to Grant.FATHER GOOSE is Cary Grant's last lead role. He hoped he would soon pass into supporting parts but although the film did well at the box office I saw it when it came out  the audiences were packed it confused many who did not care for Grant being scruffy. The result was that Grant made one more comic film WALK DON'T RUN wherein he played the Charles Coburn part in this remake of THE MORE THE MERRIER. After that Grant retired from motion pictures until his death in 1986. He never did get the chance to play that movie heavy he always wanted to  but he did leave a first rate record of sophisticated leading men comedies. That's not the worst reputation to leave behind one as a performer.".

LUCKY or a suspected jewel thief TO CATCH A THIEF or a successful university professor who was targeted by a jealous rival PEOPLE WILL TALK. But while some of these parts approached the villain he wanted to play none hit the actual target. In 1964 Grant finally got a chance to undercut his sophisticated sharp dressing style. He got the chance to play South Sea island rat Walter Eckland a grizzled loner who has little use for the modern world and a large appetite for alcohol. The film was the film comedy FATHER GOOSE costarring Leslie Caron as Catherine Freneau the daughter of a French colonial governor and Trevor Howard as Commander Frank Houghton of the Royal Navy. Again Grant was cheated out of the full chance of playing a disreputable type. Eckland is disreputable he is first seen trying to steel gasoline supplies needed by the royal navy which is fleeing a threatened dockyard  for his own cabin cruiser. But by the time the film ends he is shown to be heroic.Fortunately it is a comedy with it's three leads playing well off each other. Grant is dragooned by Howard into being an island watcher for the British navy against Japanese planes and ships. To keep Grant from splitting Howard wrecks the cabin cruiser and he hides Grant's supply of alcohol. It works but a few months later Grant is informed he has to perform a rescue from another island across the sea. He only does it when Howard informs him where the rest of the alcohol is hidden. Then he goes only to find it is Caron and six little school girls left in her care when evacuating a French island. Almost immediately there is friction between Grant and Caron as to proper behavior in front of the girls and in serving the young ladies and Caron first. When they get back to Grant's island Caron has the young girls hide his liquor all over again.It has been suggested that Grant and Caron were playing roles similar to Humphrey Bogart and Katherine Hepburn in THE African QUEEN. Certainly in the relationship of Charlie and Rosie in that film there is a definite resemblance to that of Walter and Catherine. But this kind of opposite attracts appears before THE African QUEEN did. In VESSEL OF WRATH set in the South Seas in the 1930s the harddrinking Charles Laughton ran afoul of missionary Elsa Lanchester. As with the other two pairings they eventually fall in love.But the humor in FATHER GOOSE is Grant's attempts to maintain his control over the island even while thrown out of his hut by Caron and her charges. Every time he tries to show who is boss he's undercut by the ladies. Howard although at a distance is no real help  the war is of first importance to Allied planning not rescuing angry drunken island rats. It is only when Grant shows that he can fish but Caron cannot that he starts reducing her ascendancy over him and the capoff is when he believes she is dying of snake poison and she is made comfortable by large cups of Grant's booze in a coconut cup. With her hair down she suddenly is not so inhumane to Grant.FATHER GOOSE is Cary Grant's last lead role. He hoped he would soon pass into supporting parts but although the film did well at the box office I saw it when it came out  the audiences were packed it confused many who did not care for Grant being scruffy. The result was that Grant made one more comic film WALK DON'T RUN wherein he played the Charles Coburn part in this remake of THE MORE THE MERRIER. After that Grant retired from motion pictures until his death in 1986. He never did get the chance to play that movie heavy he always wanted to  but he did leave a first rate record of sophisticated leading men comedies. That's not the worst reputation to leave behind one as a performer.";

Nowadays it is not so laughoutloud funny but I still do smile and recall that first viewing when it was new and fresh and I had no idea who Cary Grant was only that he was the funniest actor I had ever seen. I had no conception of perfect timing flawless delivery or crackling wit but luckily Grant could more than supply my deficiencies.Walter Eckland is in fact my patron saint because he embodies the hope that when I am an old brokendown drunk with a hole in both my boat and my bottle without a penny to my name and in fact 200 in hock to Old van Der Hoven I too can get a hot chick like Leslie Caron. Also he personifies the hope that I can drink my way through a case of whiskey without ever showing a sign of drunkenness.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have a certain fondness for this 1964 movie because it is one of the earliest I remember seeing in the back of my parents' 1963 Rambler station wagon at the nowdefunct Burlingame DriveIn near San Francisco. The film's catchy theme song Pass Me By was in my head for years. In the intervening years I have come to recognize Cary Grant's immaculate precision as a comic actor and even playing a grizzled alcoholic beachcomber like Walter Eckland he still exudes the sharp wit and crack timing that is his hallmark. In fact Grant is at the top of his game here.Sharply written by Peter Stone and Frank Tarloff the story revolves around Eckland's futile attempts to remain reclusive aboard his boat tooling around the South Pacific. Unfortunately WWII is raging on and the British Navy need to use him as a hidden spotter of Japanese fighter planes. He is tricked into the role and remains shipwrecked manning his post on an isolated island. Enter Catherine Freneau a priggish French schoolteacher who has been stranded on another island with seven schoolgirls. Eckland fetches them and they all cohabitate with inevitable shenanigans occurring.Director Ralph Nelson who generally made relatively lightweight fare keeps the story fairly facile until they come under attack and a suspenseful element is carried through to the end. In what turned out to be his last leading role romantic or otherwise Grant was applauded at the time for dispensing with his suave manner to inhabit this character but actually it's a throwback to the everyman characters he played in Only Angels Have Wings and Gunga Din. The difference is that at age sixty he displays his talents as both romantic comedy lead and action hero with such seasoned adroitness.As Catherine Leslie Caron demonstrates just how greatly underrated she is as a comedy actress. Even though her character threatens to be strenuously rigid she conveys Catherine's vulnerability with subtle nuance and also has a very funny drunk scene where she gets to show off her ballet dancer gams. Grant and Caron have great chemistry. Trevor Howard dryly plays Eckland's friendly adversary Commander Houghton who transmits instructions by ham radio and the girls are all gratefully portrayed with individual personalities. I have always been impressed how this film maintains its light heart and humor even though it's clear that the wartime setting is a critical element of the plot. It remains good solid entertainment.".

To make matters worse the final explanation is outright ridiculous.

Suddenly his reality changes to another one and Arthur discloses innermost secrets hidden in his mind since his childhood and finds the truth about his brother and himself.La Bote Noire has a great initial sequence with Arthur's accident and is intriguing. Unfortunately the predictable conclusion is very disappointing. This movie and The Jacket of the same year  2005 are ripoff of Adrian Lyne's Jacob's Ladder 1990. The performance of Jos Garcia in the role of a paranoid character is great and the cinematography is very above the average showing the pace of a video clip. In the end this film is a reasonable entertainment. My vote is six.Title Brazil Caixa Preta Black Box".

	schema:reviewBody "Neither thriller or very poor nor fantastic or missing the point nor absolutely nothing maybe hardly an involuntary turnip...It's beautiful to care about the shape of a picture it's even great when we make it well and the greatest stuff it's when we've got a rather solid story... now it's not the case here the shape is soooo bad traveling used like amateur pretty bad effects see it to believe overbids of camera movements thanks to the director for the bad use of the provided means. When you try to make a Fincher's like well you put all your guts in it or do it  la classical way we even have difficulty in being moved by the loud failure at the box office at least the producers will think twice before giving money to Berry especially when he tries to put on life a story so stupid.

When you try to make a Fincher's like well you put all your guts in it or do it  la classical way we even have difficulty in being moved by the loud failure at the box office at least the producers will think twice before giving money to Berry especially when he tries to put on life a story so stupid.

	schema:reviewBody "I've always been fascinated with the idea of stopping time so when I saw the trailer I was really interested in seeing the movie.  Anyhow the movie was actually really cool and had some REALLY cool ideas.  I really liked the idea that they weren't actually stopping time they were just slowing it down REALLY slow.The main reason I wanted to see the movie was for the special effects and I wasn't let down the special effects were spectacular and lots of fun. As far as acting goes I thought all the actors did a find job.  I liked Jesse Bradford French Stewart Michael Biehn and last but certainly not least Paula Garces.  I was really impressed with Paula's beauty she is a quite a beautiful woman and predict a great future for her.  I can't wait to see her next project.As far as storyline goes I thought it was pretty darn good and rather smart.  There were a few things that I could have done without but I can deal.  One part that really struck me as odd was when he Jess Bradford was in the bathroom at the hospital and he was trying to get the watch timestopper to work.  While he was in the bathroom the bad guys slow down time and come walking into the hospital and suddenly you see Jesse disguised as a cop and then as soon as the baddies walk by Jesse takes off running.  I assume he got the watch to work momentarily but that doesn't really make sense because later in the movie he gives it to French Stewart so he can repair it and get it working again.  I just think that one scene could have been explained better and it would have been quite easy to do.One little movie trivia tidbit that I noticed in the film was when Francesca and Zak are having fun with the watch and she says Make it so Number One.  That is a reference to Star Trek The Next Generation. Captain Picard always said that to Commander Riker aka Number One.  This is interesting because Clockstoppers is directed by Jonathan Frakes who plays Commander Riker in Star Trek.I hope you enjoyed the movie as much as I did.  It's not a superb scifi movie but it's fun and it's got lots of cool things to look at and some fun ideas.  Thanks for readingChris".

The story revolves around a mysteriouswatch with the power to speed the wearer's molecules and allow him to move faster than anything around him does. Scientist Earl Dopler sent a prototype of the device to friend and college professor George Gibbs to help him perfect the device. One afternoon the watch accidentally falls into a broken toaster where George's son Zak picks up to take with him.Zak has been trying to get a new foreign exchange student to go out with him. She finally agrees after he goes out of his way to stop some bullies from harassing her and agrees to have him come over to her house to help rake the lawn.When he activates the watch thinking it's a stopwatch time slows suddenly and while taking the bag of leaves to the garbage can comes across a hissing possum. He pokes it and thinks it's dead and waltzes into Francesca's house to show her what he found that was invading the trash cans and his watch suddenly ends its time and everything goes back into standard motion. The possum isn't really dead and when he tries to explain things get out of hand.After figuring out what the watch does Zak and friends go on the lam trying to escape the organization that's trying to get it back. They use similar watches preventing him from using the watch as an escape mechanism.Nickelodeon films one of the production companies behind the film have been known for good and bad movies throughout their feature film career and have managed to stumble across both an idea and a director that works. Frakes proved his capabilities with the feature film Star Trek First Contact a terrific film that shines among its fellow Star Trek films. Now Frakes has branched further into the science fiction genre stepping away from his small screen productions. He takes a potential childish and unemotional film blends in the right amount of scientific explanation avoids paradoxes adroitly and keeps the film excellently paced with plenty of room for enjoyment.The performances are probably the weakest part of the film. Each actor does his very best to portray the characters realistically and perhaps their relative inexperience is a factor. Bradford has numerous credits to his short career including Hackers but smiles far too often for his characters needs and even when he's upset or angry the telltale smile is nearby. Garcs tries her best but with the broken English she feels more like a caricature than a character but she is awfully beautiful! The same goes for the third friend Meeker who is around for comic relief more than for dramatic necessity.Television actors Stewart and Julia Sweeney as Zak's mom are capableactors in their own rights but for Stewart this was a step in the wrong direction as he bounces well over the top of good taste in his rather amorphous role.The true prize of the picture is its slowdown visual effects. Usingtechnology first seen in commercials to stop the action and then using a composite image to allow actors to walk freely amongst stopped figures was a bit troublesome at first but as the film went on the effects were better. The most notable was the frozen water droplets hanging in air while the actors interacted with them. The effect was admirably done and important only to the magnificence of the experience.Clockstoppers is most certainly made for teens but adults will be able to sit back and enjoy the film without feeling talked down to.  I thoroughly enjoyed it!".

This causes a lot of conflict between them and Zak tries to get his father to understand how he feels.  His dad looks guilty but professes that Zak is exaggerating. When he has promised to go with Zak to look at a car that is Zak's heart's desire his dad suddenly has to go away to help an old student who is having a problem with an invention.The invention is a wrist watch that can be activated to put the wearer into hypertime.  After the father leaves Zak finds the watch and puts it on thinking it is only a watch. While visiting a girl he has recently met Zak pushes the button to check the time and voila!  Time stops.  To the viewer it appears to freeze everyone and everything else but then you begin to notice that drops of water from the sprinkler are still falling just falling a millimeter per second a hummingbird suspended in midair is still flapping his wings but so slowly that you can barely see the movement. However Zak and anyone who is touching him when he activates hypertime is moving at what appears to be a normal speed.Zak is stunned at first but eventually realizes what has happened and as a typical teenage boy proceeds to have some fun with it along with the girl he wants to impress!  Some of the tricks they pull are hysterical and lead you to imagine what you might do if you got ahold of this watch!Of course there must be an evil plot behind this somewhere and we soon learn what that is.  This leads to grave danger for Zak his dad and Zak's new girlfriend and also provides for some fun car chase scenes.The movie of course requires you to suspend disbelief and if you aren't capable of that skip the movie!  Otherwise you are only going to spend the hour criticizing the scientific aspects of hypertime and annoying everyone around you who has some imagination and is having a good time.The movie is directed by Jonathan Frakes who played Commander Riker on Star Trek the Next Generation.  He apparently learned a lot during his STNG days and puts it to good use in this science fiction funfest.  Thanks Number One.  You made it so.".

Why are the vehicles they drive able to run at accelerated speed?  When they move the DJs the movements happen in realtime.  The lead characters are accelerated not invisible.  That process would have been more like stop motion animation ie. very tedious.I guess I just couldn't get past those inconsistencies.  For a better timepiecestopstime movie find the TV movie from 1980 The Girl The Gold Watch and Everything.";

In the first scenes of the film we see that they are orphaned and taken in by a man who has lost his son in the same fire that killed the boys' friends and family.When we see them in present day Gable is running an illegal gambling joint leaning on people for money they owe and dating the Loy character. Powell is in politics. After Loy spends some time with Powell she decides she'd rather be with him and eventually they marry and Powell moves from DA to governor. Gable becomes increasingly ruthless though the two remain devoted friends.There are some melodramatic sections in the film particularly the beginning and the courtroom scene which contains a very dramatic speech delivered by Powell. The acting is marvelous. Gable is likable as a slick gangster who takes things in stride. His smile lights up the screen. He really had one of the great screen presences  looks a great voice and dripping with charm.But the really interesting performance is given by Powell. He's not the witty energetic Thin Man in this but a very committed and serious dignified person with a lot on his shoulders. He's totally believable and he and Gable provide great contrast. Powell's scene at the end of the film is very touching.Enjoy the great stars and the story but don't look for laughs.".

	schema:headline " A fascinatingly unusual drama";
	schema:reviewBody "Well unusual for me.  Perhaps at the time the circumstances what have you it was not so unusual.  But for me watching Clark Gable portray a happygolucky double murderer who garners tons of sympathy from the audience it was a first.Manhattan Melodrama is a film of dubious and rather interesting morals. Who's the hero?  Who's the villain?  Childhood friends Jim and Blackie grow up very different men Jim becomes DA of New York City while Blackie runs a casino and performs other unsavory activities.  Eventually their positions force them into conflict but it's not your typical runofthemill courtroom drama. Blackie in most films would be a villain he is after all a gangster and a murderer amongst other activities.  But here he's played by Clark Gable about as charming an actor as ever lived and the movie takes place in the 1930s when gangster pictures like Little Caesar elevated these types of men into hero roles.The picture makes a very blatant message against the heroic vision of gangsters In a speech by Jim that feels as if the men who controlled the Production Code were standing off screen holding the cue cards for him. But I couldn't help feeling sympathy for the character after the evil deeds he did.  Meanwhile Jim a hardworking individual who is uncorruptable comes off as cold by the end of the picture.  The way this movie sidesteps conventional roles is really interesting.The lead woman in the picture Eleanor is rather interesting too.  Watch how she jumps back and forth and between the men and for what reasons. I don't fully understand this movie and it's not one of the most exciting films I've ever seen but it's one of the most interesting ones I've seen in quite a while.".

	schema:headline " John Dillinger Died For This Film";
	schema:reviewBody "Manhattan Melodrama is a trivial pursuit game all in itself. Consider the number of things it's known for. 1. The only teaming of Clark Gable and William Powell. 2. The first teaming of William Powell and Myrna Loy. 3. A popular song that didn't get popular from this film. 4. A famous gangster being shot to death because he wanted to see this. 5. William Powell's first film under the MGM banner. And I'm sure I might think of a few more later on.It's a very dated piece but made enjoyable because of the skill of its three leads. Two kids Mickey Rooney and Jimmy Butler who later become Clark Gable and William Powell are left orphaned as a result of the famous General Slocum disaster in the first years of the 20th century. One works hard studies hard and becomes a successful lawyer and prosecutor. The other works hard becoming the kind of man the first one makes a living prosecuting.Gable's the gambler and his girl friend is Myrna Loy. Gable is his usual charming self but with a streak of toughness and nobody crosses him. He runs into Powell at the famous DempseyFirpo fight and later Powell runs into Loy. She gets a taste of respectability through him and she likes it. Gable would probably be sore about losing her to anyone but Powell.Powell rises to become governor of the state and Gable gets to the top of his profession the death house at Sing Sing. This is where the film truly turns into melodrama. Powell is a person of exacting moral standards a bit too exacting for my taste. I can't see how today's audience could accept the course of action he pursues for just being TEMPTED to commute Gable's sentence. Manhattan Melodrama features a song sung by Shirley Ross The Bad in Every Man. It's a familiar tune but didn't do anything for the film. Composer Richard Rodgers had faith in his melody however and persuaded his partner Lorenz Hart to try another lyric. He did and Connee Boswell recorded it and made Blue Moon a big hit.Of course the legend of the film is that John Dillinger wanted so much to see the film that he came out of hiding. As soon as it was over he got betrayed by one of the women accompanying him and the FBI gunned him down in the streets of Chicago. Manhattan Melodrama entered into American folklore after that.I'm not sure today's audience would feel this film was worth even John Dillinger's life. If he wanted to see Gable Powell and Loy so badly he should have waited later in the year for It Happened One Night or The Thin Man.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a formulaic film that is very reminiscent of many of Clark Gable's films of the era particularly SAN FRANCISCO as well as the crime dramas that made Warner Brothers so popular in the 1930sthough this film IS from MGM. If the film had different stars such as Jimmy Cagney or John Garfield you would have just assumed it was a Warner project because they made so many similar gangster filmsones where the mobster is glib and carefree but ultimately doomed to pay for his crimes. Now to me being formulaic isn't a bad thing at all. I love watching these type films and could do so again and again because they are so entertaining. After all it's hard NOT to enjoy a film starring Clark Gable William Powell and Myrna Loythey were dynamite actors and professionals. Sure they often tended to play the same type of character again and again but you grew to love them and look forward to this because the films were so consistently good and exciting. Plus as always the writing direction and production values were topnotch for the period. This predictability and consistency make this a very very good film but also unfortunately keep it from getting a really high score because there isn't a whole lot new about the film as well.Gable plays a professional gambler and killer named what else Blackie big surprise huh. His childhood pal William Powell is the district attorney who eventually runs for governor. In SAN FRANCISCO this similar type role was played by Spencer Tracybut the formula remained intact. Myrna Loy is the woman who loves them both. When Blackie kills a man as a favor to Powell who NEVER would have approvedhe was just too decent in the film Powell is faced with the dilemma of prosecuting him! Sure it's predictable and almost impossible to believe but this doesn't matter too much due to the film's quality throughoutthat is up until the end. The film SHOULD have ended with Gable's final scene but instead has an ending that immediately follows it that just seems tacked on and unsatisfying. The movie should have ended about five minutes sooner.The film is a must see for fans of Hollywood's Golden Age or fans of Gable or fans of gangster films. All others will still probably enjoy it but might also find the plot elements a bit hard to believe.".

	schema:headline " John's Last Picture Show";
	schema:reviewBody "A hugely popular film when first released in May 1934 Manhattan Melodrama is today historically important for three distinct reasons. It was the first picture to feature the bynowcommon story line of two boyhood friends who grow up to become opponents in the realm of criminal justice. It saw the first pairing of William Powell and Myrna Loy whose chemistry on screen here worked so well that they would ultimately be teamed 14 times together in films. And of course it was the last picture seen by the notorious bank robber John Dillinger who upon exiting Chicago's Biograph Theater on July 22 1934 was killed during a gun battle with police and Gmen. Today almost 80 years since its release the film still retains its impact and wonderful entertainment value thanks largely to a terrific script and the megawatt star power of its three leads.In the film we meet two young chums Jim Wade and Blackie Gallegher the latter played by 13yearold 14th billed Mickey Rooney. After the sinking of the General Slocum steamship on the East River on June 15 1904 in which over 1000 lives were lost the boys are left orphans soon taken in by a kindly Jewish man. When their benefactor is killed in a riot shortly thereafter the boys are left to their own devices. Jim grows up to become the N.Y.C. D.A. and ultimately N.Y. state governor the personification of moral rectitude as played by William Powell. Blackie on the other hand as played by Clark Gable here just a few months after the February 1934 release of It Happened One Night grows up to become an underworld figure and professional gambler. Strangely enough the two remain staunch friends although trouble does loom when Blackie's moll Eleanor Packer yes Myrna Loy throws him over and marries Wade. And then things become even more problematic when Blackie kills a man and D.A. Wade must prosecute the case and find the killer....Harking back to Dillinger I must say that if you are ever given the choice as to what your last movie will be before being executed you could do a lot worse than Manhattan Melodrama. All three stars are given ample opportunities to shine here Gable is extremely likable his faithfulness to his old buddy never wavering Powell gives two tremendous speeches one in the courtroom as he urges for the death penalty for his old friend the other in front of the State Assembly and Loy is just as sexy and beautiful as can be. The film's script just sparkles the picture won an Oscar for Best Original Story and the events depicted move along briskly and with not a bit of flab. A quick check of the names behind the camera might convince potential viewers of what a class production Manhattan Melodrama is. The film was produced by the legendary showman David O. Selznick cowritten by the famed Joseph L. Mankiewicz lensed by one of Hollywood's foremost cinematographers James Wong Howe and features a tune The Bad In Every Man by Rodgers  Hart. Lorenz Hart would later rewrite the lyrics and turn it into the familiar standard Blue Moon! Not to mention the crackerjack direction of W.S. Van Dyke who would go on to helm four of the six Thin Man films starring Powell and Loy and three films with Gable including San Francisco. Perfect entertainment package that the film is it also offers the viewer a trip to Harlem's Cotton Club a hockey game at Madison Square Garden AND a horse race at Belmont during which the boys get out of Manhattan for a while for an afternoon in Queens. Plus we are also given some very amusing comedic relief thanks to the antics of one of Blackie's henchmen Spud played by Nat Pendleton and his dimwitted galpal Annabelle Isabel Jewell. What most viewers will most appreciate though I feel is the solid camaraderie that Blackie and Wade enjoy although life has set them in opposition. Indeed Blackie's love for Wade never flags even while he is sitting on Death Row. And I'd like to think that as Dillinger felt the first bullet enter his body he flashed back to Blackie's Death Row words Die the way you lived all of a sudden. That's the way to go. Don't drag it out. Living like that doesn't mean a thing....".

It saw the first pairing of William Powell and Myrna Loy whose chemistry on screen here worked so well that they would ultimately be teamed 14 times together in films. And of course it was the last picture seen by the notorious bank robber John Dillinger who upon exiting Chicago's Biograph Theater on July 22 1934 was killed during a gun battle with police and Gmen. Today almost 80 years since its release the film still retains its impact and wonderful entertainment value thanks largely to a terrific script and the megawatt star power of its three leads.In the film we meet two young chums Jim Wade and Blackie Gallegher the latter played by 13yearold 14th billed Mickey Rooney. After the sinking of the General Slocum steamship on the East River on June 15 1904 in which over 1000 lives were lost the boys are left orphans soon taken in by a kindly Jewish man. When their benefactor is killed in a riot shortly thereafter the boys are left to their own devices. Jim grows up to become the N.Y.C. D.A. and ultimately N.Y. state governor the personification of moral rectitude as played by William Powell. Blackie on the other hand as played by Clark Gable here just a few months after the February 1934 release of It Happened One Night grows up to become an underworld figure and professional gambler. Strangely enough the two remain staunch friends although trouble does loom when Blackie's moll Eleanor Packer yes Myrna Loy throws him over and marries Wade. And then things become even more problematic when Blackie kills a man and D.A. Wade must prosecute the case and find the killer....Harking back to Dillinger I must say that if you are ever given the choice as to what your last movie will be before being executed you could do a lot worse than Manhattan Melodrama. All three stars are given ample opportunities to shine here Gable is extremely likable his faithfulness to his old buddy never wavering Powell gives two tremendous speeches one in the courtroom as he urges for the death penalty for his old friend the other in front of the State Assembly and Loy is just as sexy and beautiful as can be. The film's script just sparkles the picture won an Oscar for Best Original Story and the events depicted move along briskly and with not a bit of flab. A quick check of the names behind the camera might convince potential viewers of what a class production Manhattan Melodrama is. The film was produced by the legendary showman David O. Selznick cowritten by the famed Joseph L. Mankiewicz lensed by one of Hollywood's foremost cinematographers James Wong Howe and features a tune The Bad In Every Man by Rodgers  Hart. Lorenz Hart would later rewrite the lyrics and turn it into the familiar standard Blue Moon! Not to mention the crackerjack direction of W.S. Van Dyke who would go on to helm four of the six Thin Man films starring Powell and Loy and three films with Gable including San Francisco. Perfect entertainment package that the film is it also offers the viewer a trip to Harlem's Cotton Club a hockey game at Madison Square Garden AND a horse race at Belmont during which the boys get out of Manhattan for a while for an afternoon in Queens. Plus we are also given some very amusing comedic relief thanks to the antics of one of Blackie's henchmen Spud played by Nat Pendleton and his dimwitted galpal Annabelle Isabel Jewell. What most viewers will most appreciate though I feel is the solid camaraderie that Blackie and Wade enjoy although life has set them in opposition. Indeed Blackie's love for Wade never flags even while he is sitting on Death Row. And I'd like to think that as Dillinger felt the first bullet enter his body he flashed back to Blackie's Death Row words Die the way you lived all of a sudden. That's the way to go. Don't drag it out. Living like that doesn't mean a thing....";

	schema:reviewBody "From what I can gather two main social factors led to the popularity of the gangster genre in the 1930s. The first and most obvious was the prevalence of criminals like Al Capone and John Dillinger who were glorified by the national media. The second was the Great Depression and how it impacted the traditional notion of the American dream. Families  regardless of character or social standing  were torn apart amid the economic collapse and no doubt many ordinary citizens contemplated crime as the route to happiness.Films like 'Manhattan Melodrama 1934' and 'Angels with Dirty Faces 1938' place great emphasis on the thin line between good and bad characters and often the central criminals are lamented as victims of circumstance. For example James Cagney's Rocky Sullivan and Pat O'Brien's virtuous priest were separated by a matter of metres when the former is condemned to a life of crime. Circumstance too drives the fates of the characters in 'Manhattan Melodrama.' As children both Jim Wade William Powell and Blackie Gallagher Clark Gable lose their parents in the burning of the steamship SS General Slocum a truelife disaster caused by gross negligence that cost over 1000 lives. Each child responds to this injustice in their own way Blackie rebels against the judicial system that betrayed him whereas Jim enters law in a bid to reform it.Whereas Warner Bros. was responsible for most of the decade's gangster films 'Manhattan Melodrama' was produced by MGM and helmed by W.S. Van Dyke director of the first four 'Thin Man' films whose decidedly nongritty aesthetic style at first seems at odds with the required mood. However it would be misleading to compare the film with the likes of 'Little Caesar 1931' and 'Scarface 1932.' Firstly Hollywood was now working for the first time under the active supervision of the Production Code Administration. Also the studio's intentions for the film were undoubtedly geared towards a higherbrow audience further suggested by the unintimidating womanfriendly title.Gable's Blackie Gallagher is not a paranoid hothead like Tony Camonte or Rocky Sullivan and indeed remains oddly passive throughout the film. When he does commit murders it seems to be merely out of an obligation to genre conventions. Even when old friend Jim Wade dramatically demands his execution Blackie looks on with a detached amused smirk doodling idly from the defendant's chair the expected outburst of emotion never arrives. Instead the story's central conflict unfolds entirely within the righteous Wade who must choose between his personal and professional allegiances.'Manhattan Melodrama' has achieved some notoriety for being the film that killed John Dillinger so to speak. The fugitive bankrobber was gunned down by FBI agents as he emerged from a screening at Chicago's Biograph Theatre on July 22 1934 clips from the film were recently featured in Michael Mann's 'Public Enemies 2009'. These curious circumstances can't help but make one ponder what Dillinger had thought of 'Manhattan Melodrama.' Had he like Blackie accepted that his time was coming to an end? Did he welcome death over a lifetime of legal persecution? At the very least he checked out having experienced a very fine addition to the genre.".

A man who could take it. Even when it meant that his lifelong friend would be the prosecutor who would send him to the electric chair. Even though that friend later the governor would not commute his sentence as a matter of principle. I mentioned San Francisco 1936 in that film his character was also named Blackie and there was a conflict between the somewhat bad Blackie there and another man in that case Spencer Tracy instead of William Powell and a sort of battle of wills as to what kind of woman she Jeanette MacDonald instead of Myrna Loy would become.This is one of William Powell's better roles...and he usually was wonderful! Here he plays a man of principle...even when that principle shakes him to his core. It's a very serious role and he plays it with dignity. As much fun as he was in films such as The Thin Man this was a particular stellar role for him.And this was his first pairing with Myrna Loy and  as usual  Loy's performance is top notch.The only other performance here of particular note is that by a very young Mickey Rooney. Although hardly as polished as his later portrayals one can see why he became a star.One thing that really caught my eye...or should I say ear...was a song with very strange lyrics that later was transformed into Blue Moon by Rogers and Lorenz Hart.I would guess that MGM didn't realize what a gem they had here. It was extremely popular at the box office. And it has the distinction of being the film that John Dillinger saw and was subsequently shot to death by the FBI after leaving the theater.This is a superb film and I'll give it a rare 8. And I'm going to Amazon now to see if it is available on DVD.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Manhattan Melodrama' is the kind of film that has been referenced so often to the point where it's kind of become a clich. The 30's Gangster picture is really one of the great joys I have in film. All of them generally follow the same plot line an antihero gangster lives large on the heels of prohibition but eventually the world comes crashing down on them and they are forced to reconcile for their sins via the Hays Code. 'Manhattan Melodrama' is exactly what it's title suggests all these gangster pictures were melodramas and sometimes I love that sweet sap.The only thing really different about Melodrama that distinguishes it from other gangster pictures of the time is that it deals with a friendship with two characters on different sides of the law. It takes this storyline very seriously and it works in large part thanks to the performances of both Powell and his counter part who is of course the suave and cool Clark Gable as the gangster Blackie Gallagher. I wished the film had dealt more with the deterioration of this friendship. But you can't cast Gable as someone who is a complete villain and so while Blackie does villainous things he never quite crosses the threshold and always loves his surrogate brother Jim Wade. Powell is good as Wade and I like how the character is written as a man with an insanely strict moral compass who has a friend in Blackie.The biggest thing I wanted to see though was these friends being forced to reconcile their natures with their friendship. These two men can't be friends and love each other in the two worlds they live in. The film really comes to an unsatisfying conclusion largely because of the lack of emotion involved. Blackie agrees with the charges against him and his crimes and is willing to pay for them with his life because of his love for Wade and Wade tries to fend off emotion and execute Blackie as Governor because of his moral code. Never is there a moment where these two ask Why are we friends and why did it have to come to this? And if Blackie truly does die because of his love for Wade then having Wade resign as Governor truly ruins his death. If this was a story about dear friendship to the bitter end wouldn't it be more poignant if Blackie made a sacrifice? These characters let everything play out without trying to skew destiny or question it.Why is this a fun picture? Gable. I could see this very easily being forgettable hadn't he been here. Gable might just have been the actor with the most charisma and presence in the long history of motion pictures. The picture works a lot because of Gable who is just so darn interesting and cool as Blackie who isn't really that great a character. The epitome of Gable's presence has to be Blackie's last scenes before his execution. He is really delivering dime story philosophies of life which as written are pretty stupid but as delivered by Clark Gable are amazing. It is just really really fun to see Gable dressed up as the gangster and go through the wiseguy talk in an MGM sound picture no less! What do I think of the film overall? For those who love gangster films it's a must see. It delivers on everything you come to expect and it comes from really one of the most fun performers to watch in film. It's a fun movie.".

Loy was a little more flexible check out The Best Years of Our Lives but here she is Nora Charles before Nora was even born.Nat Pendleton plays one of his trademark goons and in a small role the Harlowesque Muriel Evans shines almost literally as Tootsie.";

But they're not. The script badly compromises itself by insisting that gangster Blackie Gable remain preternaturally steadfast to his friendship with DA Wade.Because of that we get Blackie's Gable ludicrous behavior in the death house where he treats impending death as something of a joke. After all if Blackie betrays any note of even anxiety in the face of death Wade might be blamed for causing it. That's because it's he the DA who sentenced Blackie to the ultimate punishment. But of course Wade relents at the last moment wanting to commute Blackie's sentence on the basis of their friendship. However that would betray his oath of office so Blackie refuses the commutation knowing it would discredit his District Attorney friend. As a result we get more of the utterly ridiculous death house scene that Blackie laughs his way through so as not to compromise Wade in any fashion. At least one sober note in the face of 20000 volts would certainly have helped plausibility but we get none. To me at least this undermines the movie's overall credibility ode to friendship or not. Looks to me as though MGM wanted to put their budding stars in the best possible light regardless of damage to the story. But undermine an otherwise wellproduced story they did.".

	schema:reviewBody "Manhattan Melodrama is the only movie that Clark Gable and William Powell made together. They're wonderful in this film but MGM and other Hollywood studios couldn't afford to use two of their top male stars in the same shows very often. Besides few films called for two leads as costars and the studio wasn't about to cast a star lower while he was still on top. I wonder if either actor would have agreed to such given the opportunity. So we have this one film of the two great actors sharing the spotlight and it comes off very well. That's probably because the film is able to break the story into three parts. One for each actor and one with both of them together. That was largely possible because of the plot. Boyhood friends grow up and take opposite paths. One is a criminal and other an honest attorney and politician. Others describe the plot in more detail. This is a very good story in a very good film. It begins when the boys are young and friends. They both become orphaned by a passenger ferry sinking. Mickey Rooney plays Blackie as a Boy. Gable is the grownup Blackie and Powell plays Jim Wade. Besides the interesting story and the friendship that continues  albeit at a distance in later years this is a movie with an example if not a moral about integrity and honesty all the way. Nowhere is such honor better displayed than in the ending which is a nice surprise Although Gable and Powell had only this one film between them female costar Myrna Loy had many more films with both actors. She co starred in seven films will Gable comedyromance adventure and dramas. And she made 13 movies with Powell  the most well known of which were a series of Thin Man movies. But a few of their comedies are among the funniest movies ever made. Comedy buffs especially may want to check these out Libeled Lady of 1936 Double Wedding of 1937 I Love You Again of 1940 and Love Crazy of 1941.

Best known for her movies with Fred Astaire she was also a delightful comedienne. She did some serious work in her prime winning an Oscar for an onlyOK soap opera. But she's good in Primrose Path. She turned tough in many of her fifties outings and she looked tough too. Here she has sort of a pixie haircut that doesn't quite work with the character and isn't flattering to her. But she's excellent.Edward G. Robinson billed second to her is superb. He always was. That man was incapable of giving a bad performance no matter how oddly cast he might have been at times. Brian Keith whom many know for sunny outings in later television is exceptional as a very tough cop. He really is the focus of this movie though the Rogers character is the lead.Who in the world was Lucy Marlow who got fourth billing? It says prison girl. Hmm. The woman playing the matron Katherine Anderson is important to the plot. She is very touching as well.Lorne Green is another actor who played some mean hombres before he became the benevolent dad on TV's Bonanza. His character is less nuanced than the one he plays in Autumn Leaves. But he does well by it.Phil Karlson was an excellent director who had some of the nastiest darkest roughest noirs of the fifties under his belt. This is among the best of them.".

As it is Rogers gets ninety minutes of snappy dialog with more brass than spent cartridges on a rifle range. But frankly all the tough talk and attitude does get tiresome despite her spirited effort. The fact that she's 40something and starting to bulge strikes me as just right for the aging partygirl part. Remember Sherry Rogers is supposed to have been around the block more than a few times and is now looking back over what she suspects is a misspent life. That's what makes her otherwise hardened character rather poignant and vulnerable. What a shrewd piece of casting to pair the highkey Rogers with the lowkey Bryan Keith. At this career stage Keith was one of the more subtle actors around able to convey a lot by doing very little. Director Karlson apparently liked him too casting him also in his 5 Against the House 1955. And for Robinson and Rogers it must have seemed like old home week at Warner Bros.But truth be told cult director Karlson is wasted in a crime drama that any one of a dozen lesser directors could have handled. At the same time I didn't see the major plot twist coming which strikes me as the most memorable part of a toostagey film although like other reviewers that family spat with sister Clara McVeagh is a real barn burner and high point. Anyway the film's an okay crime story that really serves as a vehicle for a Ginger Rogers career revival.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the best roles in the latter portion of Ginger Rogers' career. She is an incredibly earthy and entertaining bad girlcomplete with a nice accent and a lot of sass. While a somewhat similar role was given to her a decade earlier with Roxy Hart this film was pretty awful and lacked any sense of believability. In Tight Spot however she gives a firstrate performance in a film where I expected very little.The film begins with Rogers being taken from her comfy prison cell and she's whisked away to a hotel room. This is because the prosecutor Edward G. Robinson is intent on convincing her to testify against a gangster Lorne Greene. However she has no intention on making a deal with anyone as she knows if she testifies she's a dead woman.Assisting Robinson in this is a matron who you see very little of and a detective Brian Keith. Keith seems to have contempt for her and doesn't hide it. However Robinson treats her like a lady and hopes this will loosen her resolve. A bit later in the film however there's an interesting twist as Keith and Rogers seem to be developing some chemistry. Just at that interesting moment an assassin is spotted at the windowmany floors from the street below. The assassin begins shooting wildlyhitting the matron and Rogers. Rogers miraculously escapes but is even more determined not to testify. What happens next was really exciting and quite a twist. However I'll say more as I don't want to ruin the film for you.Overall this is a very well written noirlike film. Tough dialog and some nice surprises make this one worth seeingwith nice performances all around. A nice little surprise of a film.".

TIGHT SPOT remains a Bpicture but the performances elevate it to a strong 'B' and that's a lot better than some dreary high budget production. Is it a noir?

It would be a natural thing for someone like Sheri to do and it must be said that director Phil Karlson must have agreed with Rogers in this interpretation even if it didn't exactly fit into the typical noir milieu near the end of her film career Rogers certainly didn't have the power to overrule her directors in such matters of interpretation.

	schema:reviewBody "Tight Spot is a crime drama about the events that take place during the period in which a district attorney tries to persuade a female convict to testify against a ruthless gangster in a deportation case. The woman's life is constantly under threat and the attorney is desperate or her to cooperate because if she doesn't he knows he won't be able to do anything else to curtail the activities of the notorious mobster.Lloyd Hallett Edward G Robinson is the D.A. who arranges for Sherry Conley Ginger Rogers to be removed from prison and transferred to a heavily guarded hotel room where Detective Lieutenant Vince Striker Brian Keith takes charge of ensuring that she remains alive long enough to be able to testify in the case against Ben Costain Lorne Greene.Sherry had been on Costain's yacht with her friend Pete Tonelli Alfred Linder somewhere in the West Indies when another foreign gangster that Costain had illegally brought into the U.S. was also on board. Costain had been very smart in ensuring that he couldn't be directly linked to any of his various crimes and so the opportunity to get him deported for breaching the terms under which he was allowed into the country was the best option open to Hallett. Sherry however isn't open to persuasion and her decision not to cooperate is reinforced when she learns that Tonelli had been gunned down by Costain's men after he'd agreed to testify.During her time in the hotel room Sherry survives a couple of attempts on her life and also enjoys ordering expensive food as well as flirting with Striker who's also attracted to her. The extremely determined Lloyd Hallett attempts to get Sherry to change her mind by conscripting the assistance of her sister but this approach also fails badly. Will the offer of having her sentence commuted finally be enough to induce Sherry to testify or will some other development be critical in enabling Hallett to achieve his objective? Tight Spot was based on the play Dead Pigeon by Leonard Kantor and looks stagy as most of the action takes place in one location the hotel room. The advantage of this type of presentation however is that it emphasises very naturally how trapped Sherry remains even when she's out of prison and makes her situation seem even more dangerous because she can neither avoid the attentions of those who want to kill her or escape from her surrogate prison cell.The best feature of this movie is the quality of its cast who through their performances elevate a rather ordinary story into something more entertaining than it would otherwise have been. Ginger Rogers is very brash and loudmouthed as the exmodel and gangster's moll who fell foul of the law through being a chump and Edward G Robinson has a great onscreen presence. Lorne Greene looks very imposing and dynamic in his role and Brian Keith does a great job as Striker who is cynical corrupt and conflicted and eminently more interesting than any of the other characters. When he starts to unravel the torment that he goes through is palpable.Although it's not one of the best movies of its kind Tight Spot is still very enjoyable primarily because of its talented cast.".

Music is by George Duning and cinematography by Burnett Guffey.Sherry Conley Rogers is offered a way out of her prison term if she agrees to testify as a witness in the trial of mobster Benjamin Costain Green. Holed up in a hotel room under police protection Sherry starts to form a close relationship with Lt. Vince Striker Keith. Just as Costain's hitmen start to close in...Is it noir or not? That's a question that has cropped up quite a bit since Columbia released it as part of their Film Noir Classics III Collection. The presence of Karlson Kansas City Confidential Guffey In A Lonely Place Bowers The Mob and Robinson Scarlet Street certainly gives it strong noir credentials on the makers front. What transpires is more crime melodrama than noir but Tight Spot does feature noir traits. From Guffey's shadows and half lights photography to the characterisations portrayed by Rogers and Keith there's enough here to keep the noir faithful replenished.Rogers' performance casting has also been much cause for debate which is understandable as it is a role that could quite easily have been given to better femme fatale actresses of the time. Yet although she takes some getting used to and that hair cut is just bizarre Rogers does a nice line in sharp tongued sass even putting some sexy sizzle in to the bargain during a slow dance sequence with Keith. She does fine work a bit over theatrical maybe? But she nestles in nicely alongside the strong turns from Keith Green and Robinson to lift an average story to better heights.Much of the film is set within the confines of one hotel room which is both a blessing and a curse. At times it works in the film's favour because Karlson is able to wring out some claustrophobia a real sense of impending threat is evident at times. However at other times the picture feels just too stage bound stripping away some of the realistic atmosphere the makers strive for. There's also a problem of tonal shifts as comedy sticks its oar in at regular intervals including a frequent visit to a hillbilly television show that serves no purpose other than to annoy Keith's increasingly agitated detective.A mixed bag without doubt and at the half way point some may be wondering what they have let themselves in for? But the cast and makers come through in credit once the second half arrives. Because then we get action twists and a grand finale. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "Tight Spot has a potentially taut story going for it as well as some noirish photography a skilled performance by Edward G. Robinson and a solid conflicted performance by Brian Keith. Unfortunately it also is primarily a vehicle for a big star who was facing age and a new generation of movie goers. The film also was adapted from a stage play. Much of the movie feels declarative with far too many opportunities for Ginger Rogers to act. A key witness who can send vicious crime boss Benjamin Costain Lorne Greene into the slammer and then have him deported is shot down on Gotham's courtroom steps. Government lawyer Lloyd Hallet Edward G. Robinson discovers another possible witness who could incriminate Costain if she'll testify. She's Sherry Conley Ginger Rogers a feisty smartmouth con who is in prison doing a fiveyear term for a crime she says she had nothing to do with. Hallet pulls her out of prison and installs her in a fancy hotel. He assigns police detective Vince Slater Brian Keith and a team of officers to protect her. And then he tries to convince her to testify against Costain. He promises to cancel the rest of her sentence. He describes how bad a guy Costain is. He appeals to her sense of justice. But Sherry knows the other witness was gunned down. She's tough and no one's patsy. While this is going on Costain has been busy. He's learned which hotel she's at even the room. We know anyone staying in 2409 at the St. Charles Hotel is going to be in for an upsetting night. The hotel's lobby is dark and lonely. The hallways are empty and seem to go on forever. Sherry and Vince who initially is tense and disdainful toward her begin to warm up to each other. We learn Sherry isn't the playgirl her reputation would have us believe. When the first assassination attempt takes place windows are smashed a gunman almost breaks in and bullets go flying. Sherry and a police woman she has come to like are wounded the woman seriously. It takes a death to convince Sherry that a man as ruthless as Costain must be put away. Despite another assassination attempt we last see her sitting in the witness box staring at Costain as Hallet begins his questions. Rogers was 44 when she made this movie. She looks great but it's obvious she's playing below her age. She also has a tendency to chew the scenery. Her wiseguy persona simply doesn't ring true. We know it's Ginger Rogers acting. There are far too many opportunities for her to have dramatic moments...Sherry telling us about herself...Sherry and her sister arguing...Sherry describing her life when she was just 16. None of it seems authentic. The movie is a vehicle for an aging star who could still command abovethetitle roles but where those roles were more and more often in secondrate movies. Rogers might make us a little uncomfortable but Edward G. Robinson made me really sad. Here was this great actor placed unfairly and unofficially on the Hollywood blacklist at the start of the Fifties unable to get roles worthy of him in firstrate films having to take work in stuff like this. Remember films of his like Vice Squad The Big Leaguer The Glass Web and Black Tuesday? Didn't think you did. They were all scarcely more than programmers made by Hollywood journeymen. They were all from this period. Robinson as far as I'm concerned never turned in a bad performance despite all this. With Tight Spot he effortlessly dominates all the scenes he's in. He doesn't try to steal any glory from Rogers but it is his performance which seems the most authentic and interesting. Tight Spot is at best a competent film tailored to the needs of Ginger Rogers. It's not bad it's just workmanlike. If you like old films Tight Spot may be worth a watch.".

Sherry and Vince who initially is tense and disdainful toward her begin to warm up to each other. We learn Sherry isn't the playgirl her reputation would have us believe. When the first assassination attempt takes place windows are smashed a gunman almost breaks in and bullets go flying. Sherry and a police woman she has come to like are wounded the woman seriously. It takes a death to convince Sherry that a man as ruthless as Costain must be put away. Despite another assassination attempt we last see her sitting in the witness box staring at Costain as Hallet begins his questions. Rogers was 44 when she made this movie. She looks great but it's obvious she's playing below her age. She also has a tendency to chew the scenery. Her wiseguy persona simply doesn't ring true. We know it's Ginger Rogers acting. There are far too many opportunities for her to have dramatic moments...Sherry telling us about herself...Sherry and her sister arguing...Sherry describing her life when she was just 16. None of it seems authentic. The movie is a vehicle for an aging star who could still command abovethetitle roles but where those roles were more and more often in secondrate movies. Rogers might make us a little uncomfortable but Edward G. Robinson made me really sad. Here was this great actor placed unfairly and unofficially on the Hollywood blacklist at the start of the Fifties unable to get roles worthy of him in firstrate films having to take work in stuff like this. Remember films of his like Vice Squad The Big Leaguer The Glass Web and Black Tuesday? Didn't think you did. They were all scarcely more than programmers made by Hollywood journeymen. They were all from this period. Robinson as far as I'm concerned never turned in a bad performance despite all this. With Tight Spot he effortlessly dominates all the scenes he's in. He doesn't try to steal any glory from Rogers but it is his performance which seems the most authentic and interesting. Tight Spot is at best a competent film tailored to the needs of Ginger Rogers. It's not bad it's just workmanlike. If you like old films Tight Spot may be worth a watch.";

Rogers plays Sherry Conley in prison for harboring a fugitive. When the big witness against a mobster Greene is killed she's asked to be a witness against him so that he can be deported. She realizes the danger but stalls in making her decision because she's in a hotel and can order room service and take private showers. Also one of her guards Vince Keith is attractive and there appears to be a chemistry there. After a couple of murder attempts she wants to go back to prison.Tight Spot isn't exactly an A movie it's more like a B  it's filmed in black and white and fits into the noir genre. However it's based on a play and it's obvious  the scenes aren't opened up at all and there's a ton of dialogue. It doesn't appear that Karlsen directed either Rogers or Eve McVeagh very well. Both actresses approach their roles as if they're doing them for stage the effect is over the top.Ginger Rogers was a wonderful actress and a very versatile one. Like all female film stars the roles became a little less interesting after she turned 30 and all but disappeared when she turned 40. She's 44 here playing someone younger and she is very effective if a little overdone in parts. Robinson is great as usual and a young Keith gives a relaxed performance. Greene was cast as a villain often until he played Pa Cartwright. At the age of 45 when the show started he was 13 years older than Adam Cartwright Pernell Roberts. After that he played fathers and producers didn't care whose father Ava Gardner's for instance in Earthquake. He was seven years older than Ava. He does a good job here in a fairly onedimensional role.All in all okay.".

Robinson who's always good. In any case even though it doesn't really cover any new territory it does contain some fine performances by Eddie G. its other headliners Ginger Rogers and Brian Keith and also its supporting cast which includes Lorne Greene Katherine Anderson Doye O'Dell and Eve McVeagh as Rogers's estranged sister.Rogers plays streetwise and sassy Sherry Conley who's in prison where she's serving the last 11 months of a 5year sentence until government prosecutor Lloyd Hallett Robinson has her moved to a luxury penthouse apartment the weekend before his big case to export gangster Benjamin Costain Greene. The wellconnected gang leader had successfully eliminated all previous witnesses to his criminal activities the last just before his extradition trial hence Hallett's desperate and expensive enticements to get Sherry to testify. She's treated to room service meals hot showers her own room and even gets to watch television though there's only a telethon with a goofy cowboy O'Dell on the air.While each of the aforementioned characters is in a tight spot it's then revealed that Vince Striker Keith is perhaps in the tightest spot of all. He's the cop assigned to protect Sherry even though he's been on the take from Costain for 10 years. Vince who's initially dismissive of Sherry calling her sister becomes more and more attracted to her as they hole up in the apartment over the weekend. Both are lonely and rough edged individuals who find a mutual physical attraction as well. Vince not only buys Sherry a dress he actually protects her from one of Costain's thugs killing him in the process but not before Sherry and prison matron Willoughby Anderson are wounded in the process.It's Willoughby's subsequent death from her injuries that enrages Sherry so much that she agrees to testify forcing Vince to make a fateful decision.".

In any case even though it doesn't really cover any new territory it does contain some fine performances by Eddie G. its other headliners Ginger Rogers and Brian Keith and also its supporting cast which includes Lorne Greene Katherine Anderson Doye O'Dell and Eve McVeagh as Rogers's estranged sister.Rogers plays streetwise and sassy Sherry Conley who's in prison where she's serving the last 11 months of a 5year sentence until government prosecutor Lloyd Hallett Robinson has her moved to a luxury penthouse apartment the weekend before his big case to export gangster Benjamin Costain Greene. The wellconnected gang leader had successfully eliminated all previous witnesses to his criminal activities the last just before his extradition trial hence Hallett's desperate and expensive enticements to get Sherry to testify. She's treated to room service meals hot showers her own room and even gets to watch television though there's only a telethon with a goofy cowboy O'Dell on the air.While each of the aforementioned characters is in a tight spot it's then revealed that Vince Striker Keith is perhaps in the tightest spot of all. He's the cop assigned to protect Sherry even though he's been on the take from Costain for 10 years. Vince who's initially dismissive of Sherry calling her sister becomes more and more attracted to her as they hole up in the apartment over the weekend. Both are lonely and rough edged individuals who find a mutual physical attraction as well. Vince not only buys Sherry a dress he actually protects her from one of Costain's thugs killing him in the process but not before Sherry and prison matron Willoughby Anderson are wounded in the process.It's Willoughby's subsequent death from her injuries that enrages Sherry so much that she agrees to testify forcing Vince to make a fateful decision.";

This movie appears to be one of the former but is actually one of the latter.This movie basically is the story of privileged 20th Italian nobleman Paolo who has inherited the hotblooded nature of his grandfather Lionel Stander and uncle Gaston Moschin and is given to impulsive acts of violence and compulsive priapic womanizing. However he has also inherited the sweet sensitive nature of his late father and remains always morose and dissatisfied with his dissolute lifestyle unlike his insensitive grandfather and uncle. He falls in love with a beautiful servant girl Ornella Muti but she turns out to be the paid mistress of his grandfather. He briefly meets his match in a Roman society woman Roseanne Podesta but she has an affair with his friend. He briefly gets involved with a social gadabouterstwhile communist Pilar Velasquez. He is attracted to a pharmacist's daughter Barbara Bach and eventually married her innocent but frigid daughter Neda Americ. But none of this makes him happy and he keeps finding himself in the company of various streetwalkers played by actresses like Femi Benussi and Orchidea DeSantis.Paolo is played at different ages by three different actors the most famous of which is Giancarlo Gianinni. Giannini is good but his character is not particularly likable or sympathetic. Transplanted French actor Moschin and blacklisted Hollywood actor Stander are both pretty charismatic albeit also insufferable bastards but they are absent from large parts of the movie. The women are all quite good but a young barely 18 at the time Ornella Muti makes the biggest impression mostly because she gets nice and naked and the only thing more beautiful than Ornella Muti clothed is Ornella Muti naked. There's actually a lot of female nudity but with the exception of Muti none of it involves the name actresses even though Velasquez Americ Benussi and De Santis were not exactly ever known for keeping their clothes on.I did see this in Italian with English subtitles and it does make it a little classier.

	schema:reviewBody "One of the most beloved of operettas is The Student Prince and for a combination of reasons no sound film was made of it until this one in 1954. I venture to say that somewhere in North America or Europe there is some stock company giving a performance of it right now.One of those reasons was a little thing called World War II. As Nazi Germany rose in power stories with a German background weren't a real big sell in Hollywood. MGM which had produced a silent version of The Student Prince in 1927 with Ramon Novarro and Norma Shearer held on to the property all that time. No doubt Louis B. Mayer thought the story perfect for either Nelson Eddy or Allan Jones. I have a recording of Jones singing Deep in My Heart and he would have been a fabulous Prince.Edmond Purdom is the heir to the throne at mythical Karlsberg one of the many minor kingdoms that made up the new Second Reich. It's been pointed out to the King Louis Calhernthat Purdom lacks certain social graces and charm. The remedy suggested by Purdom's tutor Edmund Gwenn is to go to the University at Heidelberg which by coincidence is the alma mater of Gwenn.He gets quite an education at Heidelberg including one from the innkeeper's niece played by Ann Blyth.Of course what makes the Student Prince the classic it is are the words and music by Dorothy Donnelly and Sigmund Romberg. All the main songs of the score are retained with a few new ones added by Nicholas Brodzsky and Sammy Cahn. Purdom's singing is of course the glorious voice of Mario Lanza who was originally supposed to do this. Lanza at the same time the film came out released an RCA Victor Red Seal album of The Student Prince which was a big hit movie and album reinforcing the success of the other.Lanza was having a lot of trouble controlling his appetites for all the fleshly pleasures and was proving impossible to control. He got out of the film but he had already taped his soundtrack singing. MGM settled with Mario with them retaining the rights to those recordings for the film. Good thing they did because it's Lanza's singing voice as the Prince that makes this film.If you like operetta and Mario Lanza do not ever miss this one when it is on.".

	schema:reviewBody "Edmund Purdom does a fine job of lipsynching to Mario Lanza in this beautiful fairytale of a movie. The combination of Lanza's glorious romanticism and Purdom's very British demeanour is an odd combination but it works  after a fashion. It helps that Purdom was actually singing along with Lanza's prerecorded vocals  a daunting task for any singer let alone a nonprofessional like Purdom. The actor spent three months practising with the recordings and commented 20 years later It was enough to make you sweat  just listening to the voice.It's to Purdom's credit that he persevered for Lanza's singing is at the very core of this movie. The Serenade Drinking Song Beloved Golden Days and I'll Walk With God are without peer and represent the pinnacle of Lanza's achievement in English language song. Lanza's timbre was at its most ravishing by this time 1952 and he imbues these songs with such magic that every word sparkles  a feat not lost on Purdom who later compared Mario's poetic artistry to that of the great soprano Elizabeth Schwarzkopf.The Student Prince is loosely based on Sigmund Romberg's operetta with three new songs Beloved I'll Walk With God and Summertime in Heidelberg by Nicholas Brodszky replacing some of the more dated Romberg numbers. The film is a decided improvement on the creaky original and boasts a witty script replete with memorable oneliners from the screenwriting duo of Sonya Levien and William Ludwig scenarists for Lanza's The Great Caruso. As a previous reviewer has noted the original lyrics have been changed in some instances but the alterations are tastefully done.Ann Blyth provides worthy support as Kathy the barmaid with whom The Student Prince falls in love and the hilarious supporting cast includes such seasoned pros as Edmund Gwenn SZ Cuddles Sakall and John Williams.Aside from Lanza's absence what ultimately makes this merely a good movie rather than a classic is Richard Thorpe's uninspired direction. His stolid bythenumbers approach ie long shot then medium shot then closeup is at its most obvious during the musical numbers where he lacks the magical touch that the story  and the music  demands. Still he was undoubtedly a better choice than Curtis Bernhardt the Prussian pickle to paraphrase one of the characters in this movie originally slated to direct and the real reason for Lanza walking out on The Student Prince.But watch this movie for its irresistible fairytale appeal and the magic of Mario Lanza at his extraordinary best.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was one of the great MGM musicals of it's day. But for me what really makes it shine are great character performances and memorable lines For example the opening scene the royal valet Lutz expertly played by character actor John Williams 19021983 he is sent to fetch the royal tutor Professor Juttner played by Welsh born actor Edmund Gwenn 18751958 best remembered as Kris Kringle in Miracle on 34th Street. Late as usual Professor Juttner! Lutz scolds. You're a teacher and you can't even tell time! Small minds tick by the clock my dear Lutzy! But the Prince is always punctual! Yes that's what I've been trying to do educate him out of it!Because of his military upbringing Prince Karl walks talks and even dances with firmness and precision. He's informed by his grandfather that the treasury is empty and the only way to save the dynasty is to marry into money.The much anticipated event finally arrives the royal reception to announce the engagement of Prince Karl to Princess Johanna of Northausen. It's not until after dancing with the ramrodstraight prince that it become's clear to her that this isn't going to work out. Prussian virtues are impressive but cold comfort on a long winters night she tells him. The princess' grandmother Queen Matilda played by character actress Evelyn Varden 18931958 tells the king Yohanna is interested in a husband not a Prussian machine! You've taken a perfectly good boy and turned him into a Prussian pickle.Warmth and Charm! bellows the king marvelously portrayed by Louis Calhern 18951956 best remembered as Buffalo Bill in Annie Get Your Gun. That's what you need warmth and charm! So it is decided that he attend Heidelberg University to meet people his own age and introduce him to the graces of living.Upon arrival at the Heidelberg train station Lutz and his luggage are immediately lifted up and passed from student to student and carried away. Dr. Juttner remarks Well I don't know if Lutz will enjoy Heidelberg but Heidelberg is certainly enjoying Lutz!When the royal entourage arrive at the inn they are greeted by innkeeper Joseph Ruder played by the unforgettable Hungarianborn character actor S.Z.Cuddles Sakall 18841955. A veteran of German Hungarian and British roles The Student Prince was to be his final film role but what a memorable one it was sheesh! He died the following February at the age of 71.The students are in the courtyard singing and drinking bear and we are introduced to the innkeepers niece Kathi played by the charming Ann Blyth1928present Early in their relationship Karl asks her to treat him as an equal and she responds That's impossible after all you're a prince and I work here. He says Don't worry so much about my reputation. And she says Oh no your Highness it's MY reputation I'm worried about! At first he thinks of her as just the ordinary women one might encounter on maneuvers. But after she pushes him away and he falls down he quickly find out she's not that kind of a girl! Nearby Lutz witnesses the assault and reports it to Uncle Ruder. In Karlsberg what your niece dared to do she would be beheaded! Please heir Lutz you and me we are men of the world. I am not! Neither am I I'm just trying to make a living!So Uncle Ruder finds a job for Kathi as a waitress in a restaurant across the river. Karl finds out and goes over to bring her back. He then creates a commotion to get her fired. She's angry with him but while walking back through the park he shows his devotion for her by singing the beautiful song Beloved. She then realizes his feelings for her are genuine.After the masquerade ball they talk of forgetting about the world and running away to Paris together. On her way to pack she has second thoughts but he confirms his love for her by singing the stirring song Serenade. But just as they are ready to leave the Prime Minister Von Mark shows up. Your grandfather is very ill and he requests that you return at once. After meeting with his grandfather Karl tells him that he's relieved to find that his condition has improved but he's also anxious to get back to Heidelberg. It's that barmaid isn't it? says the king Barmaids are as plentiful as gooseberries. Freedom is a luxury no king can afford. Then I don't want to be king Karl says I just want to be a man. Running away from your duties will hardly make a man of you the king replies. A few days later the king dies unexpectedly.On his way to Northausen for the wedding Karl thinks of Heidelberg Kathi and the promise he made to her I'll be back. He instructs Lutz to stop the train in Heidelberg. But your Highness. it's not on the schedule! It is now Lutz he says It is now. He makes his way back to Ruder's Inn and the students are singing. But you can tell the mood is more somber it's not the same since he left. I thought I'd never see you again she says. I told you I'd come back he says. We lived in the same world then she says. It's all the world I ever wanted he says. It's a touching scene and it's hard not to get choked up when you see the look of devastation on her face when he leaves. In the final scene while riding back to the train Karl's best friend Dr. Juttner turns to him pats him on the sleeve smiles and says Let us rejoice while we are young!This movie celebrates honor friendship and true love all of the qualities that should be celebrated now.".

The Student Prince is not a faithful treatment of Romberg's operetta'mangled' is pretty apt here but to me that didn't matter what was more important was how The Student Prince fared on its own merits as a film and it fares very well.It has sumptuous production values in costumes lighting and most setsapart from a couple of very studio boundlooking outdoor exteriors and is shot in lavish Technicolour so it looks pleasing. Romberg's score is stylish and whimsical and his songs wonderful both in the operetta and in the film. In the film the standout songs and renditions are Deep in my Heart Dear Serenade and the very emotional I'll Walk with God. The Student Prince also boasts some very witty dialogue an engaging story that still resonates today and is less creaky than the story of the operettabetter than any of the stories from any of the films with Mario Lanza on screen and the ending is heartbreaking.Even when Lanza is not on screenhe was meant to originally star in the leading man role and present in voice only he still makes a great impression. Lanza had one of the most beautiful and most immediately recognisable voices for any tenor and even singer and he sounds magnificent here as to be expected his phrasing vocal emotion and musicality also toptier. Edmund Perdum had a truly daunting task replacing Lanza and then having to act to his singing voice and he does a more than credible job with it while stiff in demeanour at timesbut that worked for the character actually he plays the role with more likability and and charm than Lanza most likely would have done if he did it. Ann Blyth is radiant and noble as well as playing with natural spunk her voice blending very nicely with Lanza's. Edmund Gwenn Louis Calhern John Williams and SZ Sakall provide seasoned support.On the other hand Richard Thorpe's direction is very limp and lacking inspiration in places some scenes that came over as a little tedious as a result did cry out for a more lightfooted and wittier touch something that Vincente Minnelli would have brought if he'd been chosen. Some of the additional dialogue veers on a bit banal and corny though most of the dialogue sparkles.In conclusion looks and sounds wonderful and an entertaining film. 810 Bethany Cox".

Although from all reports the silent version directed by the great Ernst Lubitsch is excellent I haven't seen it in spite of the fact that it IS a silent operetta this 1954 sound version is a considerable letdown. Mario Lanza was supposed to have played the Prince but his temper and weight problems got him fired so the film was released with Edmund Purdom acting the role and lipsynching to Lanza's singing. Purdom is a considerably better actor than Lanza but that's really not saying much. Ann Blyth who does her own singing is very good. However the MGM adapters and screenwriters have done their dirty work. New hopelessly bad dialogue has been added as in the 50's remakes of The Desert Song Show Boat and Rose Marie but in this case the adapters have gone a few steps further. Only about half the original music the score alone is ninety minutes long is used only PurdomLanza Blyth and the chorus sing and they even filch the songs given to other characters in the stage version. Worse yet new songs not by Romberg and Dorothy Donnelly have been addedand in EVERY SINGLE ONE of the original songs only the first few lines of the lyrics have been retainedthe rest have all been changed. Audiences who are undemanding or completely unfamiliar with even a recording of the songs won't mind but although the original lyrics weren't on the level of Hammerstein Porter Berlin Ira Gershwin Larry Hart or Alan Jay Lerner's efforts Student Prince fans willand shouldbe outraged at this musical mangling.".

The story is a great concept of the stuckup rigid personality being forced to relax and enjoy common pleasures. It provides for great insights and lots of timeless humor. All this is totally destroyed by the terrible sad ending which I hated. Am I the only one? The ending takes a totally uplifting movie and flushes it straight down the toilet. If I could reach back in time and somehow smack the person responsible for it I would. It's that horrible! Would it have been so much of a stretch for this light fanciful tale to have ended with the prince marrying the woman he loved and living happily ever after? I really don't think so. Not considering that the fact that he breaks into song every ten minutes with someone else's voice ridiculously coming out of his mouth. God that ending censoredworded me off. I'm done now.".

	schema:reviewBody "All the ingredients seem to be here for a beautiful romantic musical romp and to some degree it works but it falls short of being a fully entertaining cinematic experience. Filmed before memorably as a silent film this is the first and only? version of the story with sound and in color. Purdom is the taciturn stately prince of the esteemed but financially bereft kingdom of Karlsburg. His is contracted to marry a rich princess St. John but she rejects him as too severe and inhuman. So his grandfather the King Calhern sends Purdom off to school at Heidelberg undercover as just an average guy. Here Purdom learns the ways of the common man and begins to develop a personality. He also develops a fascination for everyone's favorite barmaid Blyth and before long the couple is in love. Purdom is torn between his duties as a future king and his love for a woman who can't begin to enter the world of royalty. This film was supposed to star opera great Mario Lanza but due to conflict he was replaced by Purdom. Purdom does an adept job of dubbing the vocals which Lanza had already recorded to great effect. He is also an attractive dignified leading man though lacking the necessary spark and screen charisma to really sell this character and maintain a Hollywood career. Blyth does her own singing admirably and gives a reasonably energetic and nuanced performance. However she is saddled with an unbecoming blonde wig and some dire unbelievable costumes. She also comes off as far older than her 26 years. Perhaps it's too hard to forget her indelible role as a teenage bitchonwheels in Mildred Pierce and fully accept her in this more noble role. In any case she never seems as earthy or genuine as one might like for a character like this. There isn't enough contrast in her clothing and hair from the world that Purdom comes from. Calhern does a nice job and St. John is attractive. A roster of seasoned character actors includes Gwenn as Purdom's subversive tutor Williams as his snooty valet and Varden as St. John's wry grandmother. Thirdbilled Ericson has scarcely anything to do save one sequence in which he takes umbrage at Purdom and then enlists him in a duel. Despite some lovely operatic singing one highlight of which is a song sung at a funeral and a couple of busy group numbers in the tavern and at a masquerade ball this film never really rises above the cardboard and routine. The whole enterprise seems smothered by the oppressive 50's fussiness in the clothing and overly fairy talelike settings. Check out the downright ludicrous hats on some of the college boys and the preposterous things that Blyth has on. It's always obvious that the outdoor scenes are on a soundstage. Somehow with these trappings the thoroughly bland direction and the stilted acting styles of the leads it winds up seeming ingenuine and plastic.".

	schema:reviewBody "No spoilers in the first two paragraphs. I found watching this that much of the enjoyment of hearing Mario Lanza sing is lost when you can't see him. Lanza recorded all the songs but Edmund Purdom as Prince Karl 'performs' them via lipsync and he does it as well as anyone. I didn't detect any flaws. Still looking at Purdom is not the same as looking at Lanza and for me a big Lanza fan that sucked most of the joy out of this very lightweight movie.In brief summary set in the first half of the 20th century Prince Karl is in line to succeed his grandfather as King and while the Prince has a good factual education is always stiff and formal with almost zero people skills. This is brought out when he meets his intended the first time a Princess and she sees how he lacks passion. The problem is their Kingdom's treasury is empty and the Prince has to marry a wealthy Princess. So Prince Karl is sent off to Heidelberg as a student Prince. As his grandfather the King sends him off he says Beginning this instant you will radiate warmth and charm. That's a command. Such was the life of a Prince! SPOILERS follow. Arriving at Heidelberg the Prince has an awkward time until he meets a fraternity group that invite him in. And there drinking in the bier garden he meets pretty Kathi Ann Blyth who serves tables there. Displaying his lack of charm he sets out to get her like he sets out to get anything else kisses her and is immediately rejected as a cad. She is also the Prince's landlord's niece and happens to be a superb singer. As is the Prince.More SPOILERS. Eventually Kathi begins to accept Karl's affection but when she finds out who he really is fears that she can never fit into his world. Right when they decide to run off to Paris the Prince deciding she is more important than the Crown Karl gets news that the King is very ill and has to return home. He told Kahti I'll be back. However things change as his grandfather dies shortly and Karl becomes King. Now with the responsibility of a kingdom goes off to marry his Princess but stops briefly in Heidelberg to see Kathi but their fates are sealed his Kingdom comes before his love for Kathi.".

Americans were supposed to hate the Germans but this film had a lot of Englishtype accents instead of harsh Germanic accents. There was large emphasis on beer drinking and singing and dirndlwearing women restaurant servers drawn from the German peasantry. In real life preWorld War One Germanic leaders were fighting each other and even itching to get into a great war. In reallife America during World War One Germany was the enemy and all things German were done away with like German newspapers and street names. Get this the Kaiser was the grandson of England's late Queen Victoria. Fast forward to 1930s1940s Germany who had lost World War One. The Nazis were in real life chasing a former World War One naval officer who was broke and farmed out his large family to sing en masse for the public. The Nazis closed in on this fine gentleman because they wanted him back for the navy but he and his wife and progeny escaped to sing in the U.S. This real story was in the 1960s made into the whitewashed film The Sound of Music.Americans were supposed to hate the Germans during both wars but these two films sort of Disneyfied reality in these pre and post war films. Germany lost both wars. Even Student Prince has a man named Von Mark a coverup for Otto Von Bismarck a German leader preWorld War One. I have a History Degree including German Histories of 19th and 20th Centuries plus studies in History of War and World Wars One and Two. I am also an actress singer and dancer. I have been reviewing and critiquing films and television programs for IMDb since 2002. I have always loved this film however. Now I am seeing it through more of an historian's eye.

	schema:reviewBody "The very same year that MGM documented the musical life of Austrian born composer Sigmund Romberg they also made the only screen version of his classic operetta The Student Prince previously only seen on screen as a silent. While it's the voice of Mario Lanza whom you hear here it is the handsome face of Edmund Purdom whose mouth lip syncs to the singing. Ann Blyth had a brief MGM musical career by playing the role of bar maid Katherine who falls in love with the spoiled prince she initially finds a pompous ass. Come Boys Let's All Be Gay Boys! she sings along with her regular customers as part of The Drinking Song and indeed this is is a very gay story gay meaning something quite different here than it does today.Spoofed on I Love Lucy these type of operettas was not for every taste in the mid 1950's a cynical era of change. Today there's a bit of a camp element but if you can get past that and see only the romantic elements it truly will sweep you away into its timeless tale of a love that can only destined to be illfated. It's easy to forgive Purdom's prince for his initially snooty pretentious attitude and he wins much sympathy over his romantic rival John Ericson. S.Z. Sakall offers his usually cute performance as Blyth's employer with John Williams imperious as Purdom's valet and Louis Calhern profound as the King. But this is a film about the romance so when Blyth and Purdom through Lanza's powerful pipes sing Serenade and Deep in My Heart Dear it truly becomes romantic. The emotional highlight is the prince's singing of I'll Walk With God which comes at the turning point of his life the point where a boy must become a man and duty takes over personal desires.Blyth would shine in the three musicals she did at MGM which also included Rose Marie very different from the Jeanette MacDonaldNelson Eddy version and Kismet. This is as far a cry from her most famous role Veda in Mildred Pierce and it really is a shame that this had to come out just as the MGM musical was wrapping up its last years of glory.".

At the start we see him standing precariously on the ledge of a high building. The reason why is shown at the film's end. I won't give it away here This is followed by a flashback. He is a middleaged somewhat bored businessman who has his head turned one day when he sees a mysterious woman standing under an air vent in a car park. She happens to be wearing a flimsy red dress hence the US title of the remake which flutters in the breeze. She seems to enjoy this and returns to the vent for a second helping. After she walks away Rochefort tries it out for himself but the effect for him in his buttoned overcoat is not as sexy to the viewer. Or even him. This is the catalyst for his obsession with the girl played by Anny Duperey who eventually turns up at his place of work much to his surprise.Meanwhile his loving and quite attractive wife is being sexually harassed by a chubby friend of their teenage daughter this is not to mention the personal problems that Rochefort's tennis buddies also encounter.This is well worth a look even for the dubbed version. There was also a sequel made sometime after but the magic was not there.".

The plot has elements of The Seven Year Itch and Dabadie acknowledges this by having the fantasy object stand over an air vent which blows her dress up the difference is that in The Seven Year Itch there was only one male lead Tom Ewell and the object of his fantasy Marilyn Monroe whereas here Jean Rochefort has three male buddies all experiencing female trouble.

Wrong. These are all scenes from a 1933 musical.The first half of Footlight Parade is preparation for a musical extravaganza which occupies the last half of the film. Chester Kent Cagney is about to lose his job and does lose his playgirl wife as a result of talking pictures squeezing out live stage musicals. His producers take him to see a popular talky of the day John Wayne in The Big Trail. Before each showing of the flick a dance number is presented as a prologue. Shorts news reels serials and cartoons would later serve the purpose. Kent gets the idea that a prologue chain would be the road to salvation for the dwindling live musical business. Kent is basically an idea man along the lines of choreographer Busby Berkeley. Could it be that Cagney's character is patterned after Berkeley? Could be. In preparation for the prologues Kent learns that his ideas are being stolen by a rival. He uncovers the traitor fires him then unbeknown to him a new leak is planted in the form a dazzling temptress. His assistant Nan Prescott Joan Blondell  soon to be Mrs. Dick Powell has the hots for Kent and is determined to expose the wiles of the temptress. A new singer from Arkansas College shows up in the form of Scotty Blain Dick Powell who turns out to be a real find and is paired with Bea Thorn Ruby Keeler. The resulting three prologue musicals which couldn't possibly have been presented on any cinema stage of the day are as fresh and enjoyable today as they were over seventy years ago Honeymoon Hotel By a Waterfall and Shanghai Lil.Of special note is the song and dance of toughguy James Cagney. Like Fred Astaire and Bill Bojangles Robinson Cagney's dancing appeared natural and unrehearsed although hours went into practice to get each step just right. Not as good a singer as Astaire Cagney's singing like Astaire's sounded natural unlike the crooning so popular at the time. It's amazing that one person could be so talented and so versatile as James Cagney.Most critics prefer the Shanghai Lil segment over the other two. Yet the kaleidoscopic choreography of By a Waterfall is astonishing. How Berkeley was able to film the underwater ballets and to create the human snake chain must have been difficult because it has never been repeated. The close up shots mixed brilliantly with distant angles is a mustsee. The crisp black and white photography is much more artistic than it would have been if shot in color. Though not nearly as socially conscious as Gold Diggers of 1933 Footlight Parade stands on its own as one of the most amazing and outrageous musicals ever put on the big screen.".

Wrong. These are all scenes from a 1933 musical.The first half of Footlight Parade is preparation for a musical extravaganza which occupies the last half of the film. Chester Kent Cagney is about to lose his job and does lose his playgirl wife as a result of talking pictures squeezing out live stage musicals. His producers take him to see a popular talky of the day John Wayne in The Big Trail. Before each showing of the flick a dance number is presented as a prologue. Shorts news reels serials and cartoons would later serve the purpose. Kent gets the idea that a prologue chain would be the road to salvation for the dwindling live musical business. Kent is basically an idea man along the lines of choreographer Busby Berkeley. Could it be that Cagney's character is patterned after Berkeley? Could be. In preparation for the prologues Kent learns that his ideas are being stolen by a rival. He uncovers the traitor fires him then unbeknown to him a new leak is planted in the form a dazzling temptress. His assistant Nan Prescott Joan Blondell  soon to be Mrs. Dick Powell has the hots for Kent and is determined to expose the wiles of the temptress.

But it's so creative and fun to watch. Dick Powell gets to sing three songs in Footlight Parade Ah the Moon is Here Honeymoon Hotel and By a Waterfall the last two with Ruby Keeler further cementing that screen team. Ruby sings and dances with Powell in the last two and she partners with James Cagney in my favorite number from Footlight Parade Shanghai Lil. Joan Blondell is Cagney's no nonsense girl Friday at the theater. Like in Blonde Crazy she's the one with the real brains in that duo and it's her quick thinking that bails him out of some domestic problems he has on top of his theatrical ones.

And in a scene at the beginning of the film producer Guy Kibbee takes Cagney to a movie theater where they are showing a B western starring John Wayne. The Duke's voice is unmistakable. But what's even more unusual is that the brief clip shows him in a scene with Frank McHugh who plays another Cagney assistant in Footlight Parade.

	schema:reviewBody "It's hard to say which comes out on top James Cagney's charm and energy or the mouth opening excesses of Busby Berkeley's three grand showstoppers at the close. I give it a tie with Footlight Parade one of the funniest and quickest of the early Thirties musicals. Although the movie clearly belongs to Cagney Joan Blondell adds immeasurably to the goodnatured story line. And what's the story line? It's about Chester Kent Cagney who produces musicals and who now is just about out of business as the talkies take over. He starts doing Prologues live musical entertainment offered on stage before a movie starts. He gets the idea to do bigger ones and more of them moving them around the country. He's a ball of fire and ideas and he needs all the ideas he can get to keep relentlessly producing these things. But a rival is spying on him and stealing his ideas Nan Prescott Blondell his wisecracking secretary loves him but he's too busy too notice an office girl in blackrimmed round glasses Ruby Keeler wants a chance to dance his wife turns up saying she didn't divorce him after all a blonde golddigger is setting her hooks in him his partners are cheating him...my gosh what's next? This may all sound like a lot to digest but everything happens fast with Cagney bouncing strutting striding fingersnapping barking orders and occasionally  until the big last number when he goes all out singing and dancing  doing a step or two just to show how it's done. Instead of Let's put on a show gang we have We need to build three shows in three days so lock the doors and let's start rehearsing. These three super Prologues are going to feature 40 chorines spectacular effects and will mean a rich contract with forty Kent units in deluxe movie houses...the whole Apollo movie house circuit! Exhaustion threatens feet ache but all those unbilled chorines in skimpy costumes which include Ann Sothern and Dorothy Lamour you can quickly spot Sothern but Lamour is more generic stay the course dancing their hearts out giggling and chattering and looking remarkably unsweaty. And then the curtains go up as each Prologue is presented in separate movie houses one after the other on the same night with the owner of the Apollo circuit going to determine that night whether he'll save Chester's skin or not. First up is Honeymoon Hotel with Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler in a 9 minute production number that features a lot of wholesome lasciviousness with brides and grooms some might even be married bedrooms and beds and doors with Do not disturb signs. Then on to the next theater and 11 minutes of By a Waterfall that probably had the Warner Brothers accountants worrying about bankruptcy. This number is so excessive  dozens of swimming girls trees fountains a huge grotto with waterslides a giant pool  you'd never think there was a Depression on. Berkeley pulls out all his tricks  synchronization human patterns legs and arms doing all sorts of precision things  and he does it in the water with a lot of underwater photography looking up. The girls are sure game. They come up smiling with water in their eyes and still hit their marks. The whole thing must have been incredibly difficult and exhausting. Ruby Keeler who has a couple of quick shots in the water is the only one who looks a bit cautious. And finally the smash finale...11 minutes of Cagney dancing and singing with Keeler to Shanghai Lil with all sorts of bar girls and their customers unusual in that the races are mixed up. There's Cagney and Keeler dancing on the bar dancing on a table Cagney fighting. There are what looks like fifty or sixty marching marines hupping back and forth rifles tossed and caught. Then...this is true...a human picture forms of Franklin Roosevelt and the NRA eagle. This may be the only Hollywood musical production that has ever featured Roosevelt a big federal agency and a bevy of sexy Chinese prostitutes. That's entertainment folks. It's great! Of course Chester's Prologues get the big contract and Nan gets Chester. The movie is full of juicy clichs that make us smile. Ruby Keeler is so endearing as she earnestly stomps out her taps with her arms flying that you want to help her along. Joan Blondell makes us forget about a lot of Hollywood females who might have been more beautiful but who had a lot less wit and personality. The movie however belongs to Cagney who grabs and shakes it and to Berkeley a man for whom too much was never too much.".

Think of the huge pools and threestory tall fountains for By A Waterfall for instance. Berkeley directed John Garfield in They Made Me a Criminal six years later and had the Dead End Kids singing By a Waterfall as they took their showers. Shanghai Lil is the best production number in the picture. It's a catalog of '30s Warner Bros. sensibilities. Note the African guys mixed into the scene with white and Asian prostitutes. You would never see blacks integrated into a social scene in other films of the period unless they were porters on a train or maids in a big house. Here the black guys are sitting at the bar and singing with the others. I also get a thrill when the military dancers do a card section presentation of Roosevelt's image. There's also the NRA eaglethe logo of the controversial National Recovery Administration of the New Deal. FDR was the new president and hopes were so high that he'd pull the nation out of the Depression. You'd never see something so working class oriented coming out of MGM of course. Warner Bros. wholeheartedly supported the uplift dictated by the F.D.R. administration. Dear little Miss Ruby Keeler was never better than she is playing the Chinese hooker Lil. She hardly even watches her feet as she dances which was one of her signature flaws. The PreCode stuff is fun. The By a Waterfall number is wonderful in that regard. The girls change into their bathing suits on the crowded bus speeding through Times Square with all its lights on. The spreadeagle girls swimming over the camera provide the kind of crotch shots that would not be seen for 35 years. In a few months the Production Code would eliminate such naughty pleasures.".

Many movies back then were no more than static reproductions of talky stage plays. Busby opened the door to pure cinema.Busby is surely one of the first directors to realize that if you prerecorded the music sound tracks before you filmed the musical numbers you could then move the actors and dancers as you wished the performers would either be lipsyncing or dancing to playback and the camera could be anywhere high or low. Busby's previous experience as a drill master in the military also taught him how to train dancers and swimmers by giving them only a few steps or strokes to learn at a time by clever editing a montage of shots in time to a set music track he could then give the impression of a continuously flowing extravaganza a la Zigfield. One can only imagine how many hours went into getting the nevertobeequaled overhead snake design shot in By A Waterfall.Yes the Odessa steps sequence in Potemkin is justifiably considered to be one of the great innovative moments in cinema. Let me cast my vote for Busby's incomparable last act to Footlight Parade.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a preCode Warner Bros. Busby Berkeley musical starring...James Cagney!Cagney develops live musical prologues to be shown on stage at movie houses before the start of a film. If you've seen the Let's Go To The Movies number in ANNIE you get the idea. It's one catastrophe after another as Cagney tries to keep things running smoothly while staying a step ahead of the competition.Joan Blondell is great as Cagney's secretary who loves him more than he realizes. The solid cast also includes Busby Berkeley regulars Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler as a young new tenor and a secretaryturned leading lady respectively with Frank McHugh as the perpetually worried dance instructor and Hugh Herbert as the morality advisercensor. Lloyd Bacon directs the showbiz tale with spectacular choreography by the inimitable Busby Berkeley.I've seen this film's contemporaries 42ND STREET and GOLD DIGGERS OF 1933 and usually feel lukewarm toward these early musicals but I found myself surprisingly receptive to FOOTLIGHT PARADE. I really liked Blondell's performance with the romantic tension and snappy wit and I could tolerate Keeler in her role. McHugh adds whiny comic relief and the script has some racy preCode touches. The film also benefits from James Cagney's screen presence. Cagney best known for his gangster roles demonstrates some dance steps in this rare musical appearance.Berkeley choreographs a handful of routines including an awkward cat themed number but saves the three biggest for the very end Honeymoon Hotel By A Waterfall and Shanghai Lil. As was often the case the dance numbers are meant to be staged within the context of the story a show within a show and as was always the case Berkeley choreographs cinematically using camera movements insert shots and cuts that make no sense within the reality of the story. But his routines are meant for the moviegoers and they are aweinspiring.The water nymph routine will blow you away. I've seen my fair share of Busby Berkeley numbers but the water nymph sequence may be his masterpiece. Did Berkeley invent synchronized swimming? I don't know but he might as well have. There are unbelievable kaleidoscopic overhead shots as well as underwater choreography. I can't figure out how they did the shot of the swimmers in concentric rings spinning in different directions since the swimmers seemed to be lying still in the water. Movie magic? The more complex overhead shots are some of the most impressive visuals I've ever seen in a musical.Honeymoon Hotel is a racy little number about couples spending their first night together in a hotel. Men in pajamas women in negligees bedrooms. There's a peculiar child that runs around causing mischief but the scene has a neat largerthanlife dollhouse shot and a creative bit of stopmotion animation. Shanghai Lil follows a sailor through a crowded saloon in search of an elusive woman. There's a brawl there are marching soldiers in formation there's Ruby Keeler dolled up like a Chinese call girl and there's Jimmy Cagney dancing and singing.With a great cast and impressive dances this is an enjoyable ride. Maybe the best of the early WB musicals.".

We have to wait until the end of the film for the three centrepiece Busby Berkely extravaganza numbers but boy are they worth waiting for me. Yes little Ruby Keeler is a terrible singer and actress and her tapping is soso but Busby's magical By A Waterfall whisks her and what seems to be a hundred other chorus girls into a dizzying water wonderland. Of course Busby's numbers could never really be performed on a stage they defy limits of gravity for one thing and they contrast terrifically with the realism of the tough wisecracking nonmusical scenes.

	schema:headline " Oh Those Dancing Feet!";
	schema:reviewBody "Forget the plot. It's a kind of rerun of 42nd Street with Cagney dashing around trying to put a show together in the face of nearly insurmountable obstacles. A couple of women keep insulting each other because they want to marry him or clean his clock while divorcing him. Every movement is made at the speed of light. He discovers his new star  Ruby Keeler  when he spots his devoted and wholly instrumental secretary without her glasses. The numbers were staged by Busby Berkeley. And what numbers! The first At the Honeymoon Hotel is a kind of sketch of Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler checking into a hotel where everyone's name seems to be Smith and trying to consummate their marriage despite numerous interruptions by family strangers and a demented midget. The vocals are done in Sprechgesang. I never realized so many words rhymed with hotel. They even work in New Rochelle. It's all pretty suggestive.It was during the second number By A Waterfall that I realized how deeply in love with Ruby Keeler I was. Oh sure she can't sing and she can't act and when she's dancing with those hooflike feet she seems to be stomping a scurrying horde of roaches  but she can't sing can't act and can't dance so EARNESTLY. She's so awesomely winsome. Any normal man would want to rush up to her and hug her  before she gets too sweaty  and whisper reassuring things to her like Don't worry Darling talent isn't all it's cracked up to be. About this number. You have to be prepared for it. What I mean is don't do any psychedelic substances before you watch it. It's performed entirely in the water sometimes under it a kind of prodromal symptom that would be followed ten years later by a fullblown Esther Williams attack.Several dozen young ladies are dressed in tight skimpy costumes diving around doing synchronized swimming betimes shot from overhead sometimes forming a pair of writhing snakes that then morph without a lot of todo into an ovocyte being penetrated by a snake with a big head before thrillingly joyously all the swimmers coalesce into a blastocyte with a big smile on it. As a finale they held up coordinated placards that taken together became a remarkably nuanced portrait of Cedric the Entertainer. I found the rich use of impasto compelling. Or was it all in my mind? I think that was before the swimming girls formed the chrysanthemum or maybe it was after. One of the shots is truly memorable in its own filthy way. It's done from underwater with the camera aimed straight up between a dozen spread thighs with Ruby Keeler swimming between them and trying to smile at the lens. She also tries to smile  and to keep from blinking  while a Niagara of water cascades onto her tiny head and shoulders. I had to pop my ears after seeing it.The ultimate number is a patriotic and thoroughly tawdry sketch of Jimmy Cagney as a sailor in a Chinese whorehouse lookin' for my Shanghai Lil. It violates every code in the book  prostitution drunkenness opium bar room brawls  only to pull itself together at the end and allow Cagney to smuggle Keeler aboard a battleship dressed in a sailor suit. Her Siniticized version of English is endearing. Me love you long time! No  wait. Well I told you I was confused.".

	onyx:emotionText "Forget the plot. It's a kind of rerun of 42nd Street with Cagney dashing around trying to put a show together in the face of nearly insurmountable obstacles. A couple of women keep insulting each other because they want to marry him or clean his clock while divorcing him. Every movement is made at the speed of light. He discovers his new star  Ruby Keeler  when he spots his devoted and wholly instrumental secretary without her glasses. The numbers were staged by Busby Berkeley. And what numbers! The first At the Honeymoon Hotel is a kind of sketch of Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler checking into a hotel where everyone's name seems to be Smith and trying to consummate their marriage despite numerous interruptions by family strangers and a demented midget. The vocals are done in Sprechgesang. I never realized so many words rhymed with hotel. They even work in New Rochelle. It's all pretty suggestive.It was during the second number By A Waterfall that I realized how deeply in love with Ruby Keeler I was. Oh sure she can't sing and she can't act and when she's dancing with those hooflike feet she seems to be stomping a scurrying horde of roaches  but she can't sing can't act and can't dance so EARNESTLY. She's so awesomely winsome. Any normal man would want to rush up to her and hug her  before she gets too sweaty  and whisper reassuring things to her like Don't worry Darling talent isn't all it's cracked up to be.

The music is wonderfully arranged and catchy all three but none more so than the grand finale Shanghai Lil. James Cagney the producer of this show upon which so much depends must replace the leading man at the last minute and of course puts it over in style.

	schema:reviewBody "I have reviewed more James Cagney movies on this site than any other actoractress. Now after 8 odd years of being a IMDb reviewer I have finally got around to reviewing my ultimate favourite James Cagney movie.This was the first musical Cagney had been allowed to star in as Jack Warner saw only the potential in Cagney's ability to play the tough guy. Cagney had learnt to dance in the 20's whilst appearing in countless vaudeville productions and always preferred to do musicals whenever the opportunity presented itself.Although Footlight Parade was Cagney's first musical movie it wasn't the first time audiences had seen the man shake a shoe. He had danced in a short but memorable scene in the drama Other Men's Women 1931 and danced in a couple of scenes in Taxi! 1932 most notably in a dance competition competing against George Raft.It may have been these scenes that convinced the studio brass that Cagney was a viable musical commodity too.Footlight Parade reunites Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler and genius choreographer Busby Berkeley all veterans of Warner Brothers two other musical smash hits of that year 42nd Street and Gold Diggers of 1933.The whole main cast list of this wonderful movie also includes all the very best actors that Warner had on their books at the time. Joan Blondell Guy Kibbee Ruth Donnelly Frank McHugh Hugh Herbert and Claire Dodd.Chester Kent Cagney is a producer of musical Comedy shows who's fortunes have been blighted by two main developments. The crash of '29 which saw the demand for expensive and lavish productions dwindle and a new gimmick from Hollywood  Talking Pictures.His showbiz backers Frazer  Gould Arthur Hohl  Guy Kibbee respectively take Kent to the local movie theatre to show them why they're no longer doing the big shows and why they're making the move to become movie exhibitors. When the movie they are watching ends which incidentally is The Telegraph Trail starring John Wayne and also stars Frank McHugh. A bevy of dancers take to the stage in a routine that Frazer and Gould describe as a prologue a themed dance to accompany the preceding picture.Kent starts to produce these prologues for Frazer and Gould knowing that other movie exhibitors will pay good money for these ready made prologues rather then spending more money to put them on themselves.Kent is shown as a workaholic who seldom goes home and is dedicated to his job. However his world is not as idyllic as he would think it. His assistant Harry Thompson Gordon Westcott is actually spying for a rival prologue company and giving the competitors Kents prologue ideas and Frazer and Gould are cooking the books to their own advantage. In fact Kent's one true ally is his secretary and girl Friday Nanette 'Nan' Prescott Joan Blondell who's so head over heels in love with Kent that her loyalty is unswerving but Kent's too wrapped up in business to notice.After reading a headline regarding the fate of un produced musical shows Kent decides that they'll be transferred into prologues giving the audience a 20 minute musical comedy and a talking picture all for 50 cents. A business man with a string of movie theatres have offered him three prologues at three of his theatres in three days and if they're a success then a contract for forty theatres across the region is theirs.In order to ensure his ideas are not given to the rival prologue company he orders a blockade of his studio no one in and no one out for three days to ensure secrecy and originality.The real treat of Footlight Parade are the three prologues themselves which dominate the final half of the movie. 'Honeymoon Hotel' in which Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler elope get married and spend their wedding night in the hotel renown for turning virgin brides into wives all to the wonderful risqu music and lyrics of Harry Warren and Al Dubin.Then follows 'By A Waterfall' which is by far the most visual stunning of the three with Busby Berkeley doing what he does best a water ballet with some great kaleidoscopic overhead shots. I've said it before and I'll say it again Berkely was a genius and one day I'd love to see this sequence converted to 3D and perhaps full Technicolour. Berkely was so far ahead of his time and real 3D was invented just so we can convert Berkeley's sequences to it. I'd do it myself if I could though I have neither the money knowledge or the technology to do so. Shame otherwise it would be done tomorrow.The final Prologue is 'Shanghai Lil' which sees Cagney take the role of a sailor searching for his oriental prostitute girlfriend in a bar come opium den. All of which is dazzling.Needless to say the shows go over big and Kent and the troupe get the contracts.Mention has to be given to Dick Powell for THAT voice Keeler for THOSE feet Frank McHugh giving us some comic relieve as a cynical and inept dance director Claire Dodd as a social climbing tramp that gloms on to Kent in the hopes of ensnaring him into a honey trap. Ruth Donnelly as Goulds Money grabbing wife and Hugh Herbert as the fussy censor that ensures that Kent's prologues doesn't offend against common decency.Speaking of censorship Footlight Parade contains some of the most riskiest dialogue and content that I've ever seen in a precode film and was probably solely responsible for the rigid enforcement of the production code the following year. All innocent now but back in 1933 it must have had chins on the carpet. However that's all part of it's charm.Footlight Parade is a triumph in every way thanks mainly to Cagney and Berkeley.Enjoy!".

They had worked together for the first time the year before on The Crowd Roars and they became quick friends.  They would continue to work together in at least 10 more films.  Watch for their dialogues together and then keep a close on Cagney as he can barely contain his laughing in a few different scenes.  He manages to rein himself in to deliver his lines but clearly their warm friendship and McHugh's fabulous comedy talent ebbed onto the big screen in this film.  Lastly Cagney  Keeler's dance scene is one of my favorites of all time  I'm just sad that it was so short!".

	schema:reviewBody "FOOTLIGHT PARADE Warner Brothers 1933 directed by Lloyd Bacon with dance direction by Busby Berkeley is the third of the Warner Brothers backstage musicals following 42nd STREET and GOLD DIGGERS OF 1933 and while the plot by now is getting predictable with the show must goes on theme the production numbers that take up the last 40 minutes of film make up for it. Movie tough guy James Cagney stars as Chester Kent a famous director of stage musicals on Broadway who finds he might be out of the job because of the advent of talking pictures which is becoming big business over the now pass' stage shows. Kent who works for Al Frazier Arthur Hohl and Silas Gould Guy Kibbee productions comes up with the idea of staging prologues musical shows that precede a feature movie but the hardest thing for Kent to do is to think up how to have them presented. During the course of the story Kent has female troubles his wife Cynthia Renee Whitney who wants to divorce him Nan Joan Blondell his loyal secretary who secretly loves him and Vivian Claire Dodd a former friend of Nan's out to gold dig on Chester almost becoming a fly in her web. As Kent burns himself out in prologue preparation he finds his ideas are being stolen by an employee who gives it to a rival producer and Kent's other secretary Bea Ruby Keeler a former vaudeville headliner returns to the stage after getting groomed up from a bespectacled homely sort with closecropped hairdo to a charming looker with liberated ideas mainly because she now has her eye on a young protg Scotty Dick Powell who gets promoted to leading man of the Chester Kent prologues. During the dress rehearsals songs Ah the Moon is Here and Sitting on a Backyard Fence written by Sammy Fain and Irving Kahal are performed. Then with his female problems resolved Kent succeeds into keeping his staff rehearsing day and night before the Broadway tryout night in order to prevent his ideas from ever leaving the theater.The highlight of the movie begins with the curtain rising followed by three lavish production numbers back to back which gets better with each passing performance. The first prologue is the somewhat mediocre Honeymoon Hotel written by Harry Warren and Al Dubin with Powell and Keeler as a couple who musically encounter comedic and romantic moments while on their honeymoon in a hotel in Jersey City By a Waterfall written by Fain and Kahal the second prologue starts with Powell and Keeler singing the tune before it changes into a lavish water ballet with hundreds of bathing beauties doing geometric patterns and perennial twisting snakes effects before forming into a human fountain. This number alone worth the price of admission predates the MGM Esther Williams swim musicals by a decade but without going overboard. The final prologue Shanghai Lil written by Warren and Dubin features Cagney substituting for an appointed leading man who becomes drunk as Bill in Shanghai who looks high and low for his Shanghai Lil Keeler. After a barroom brawl he finds her sings the title song and goes into a tap dance number before the bugle sounds recalling all sailors to return to their ship. This is highlighted by military march formations and shot gun salute. All three prologues run about ten minutes each.What makes FOOTLIGHT PARADE interesting to see today is looking back at when it was made 1933 only a few years after talking pictures have taken over the screen and how advanced the choreography has become since the 192930 movie musical days thanks to Busby Berkeley. Character actors such as Frank McHugh as the assistant dance director Hugh Herbert and Ruth Donnelly along with Billy Barty participating in two numbers all do their best in the comedic moments. Inasmuch as Joan Blondell and Claire Dodd were screen beauties in their day somehow the headdress they were presented here make them appear a bit older than their true age. And look closely in the earlier portion of the story where Cagney Kibbee and Gordon Westcott go into a movie theater to watch the finish of a talking picture that's playing a western featuring John Wayne Frank McHugh and Marceline Day in THE TELEGRAPH TRAIL. Thanks to frequent television and theatrical revivals over the past decades FOOTLIGHT PARADE has and remains a favorite movie musical pasttime. 12".

James Cagney plays the role as Chester Kent who writes musicals and eventually goes into producing Prologues which are shown in between the feature films shown in movie theater's during the 1930's. Chester has trouble with people trying to steal his ideas for his shows. This is a very entertaining film with lots of comedy and plenty of laughs. Joan Blondell Nan Prescott gave a great supporting role who was also very young and pretty.

Almost ten years prior to his most wellknown musical Yankee Doodle Dandy. Here he dances in that most original of dance styles with his arms usually lowered at his side and his legs doing all types of undulations and kicks. It's easy to see that he is enjoying himself and that makes us enjoy him all the more.While almost all of the musical sequences appear at the end of the film they are well worth the wait. I believe that this film was made just prior to the installation of the production code so some of the costumes and scenes are a bit risqu. But it's all in fun.It doesn't matter what the plot of the film is just know that there are plenty of laughs and a superlative cast. Besides those already mentioned Guy Kibbee is at his flustered best here.7 out of 10".

I'm even more proud of the fact that the film makers decided to base the story in Toronto.  Too often has Toronto doubled for other cities in films it was refreshing to see the T dot O being its good old self.Until I saw this movie Ocean's 11 the remake not the boring original was handsdown favourite heist movie.  In my opinion FoolProof is practically dead even with Ocean's 11 on sheer cleverness.  I don't want to spoil anything but suffice it to say that the plot surrounding the heist and the thieves by mistake is brilliant twisting and...foolproof!The characters were expertly played with Ryan Reynolds really shining in his performance.  He came across as smart quirky and of course very funny. His comic timing blended very well with the tense heist drama.The great part about FoolProof is that unlike Ocean's 11 it didn't try to hype itself up with some veteran allstar cast to try and sell more tickets. Ryan Reynolds has significant star power but I'm not sure if the fratboy fans who say Van Wilder will warm up to this much more dynamic role.  Only time will tell I suppose.  Either way if you're a Canadian support your film industry and check out this stellar movie!".

That's not to say that there weren't gadgets and neat props used to pull of the heists  just not a plethora of things like you would see in a huge budget Hollywood movie. The parts in the movie that were supposed to be funny made me laugh and the tense parts had me going.The setup a trio of twentysomething friends making a game out of planning the perfect crime without actually any intention of pulling them off was at least a refreshing start to a caper movie.  They are not looking to score diamonds and make it rich  they are satisfied with knowing that they outsmarted the security companies and that they could pull off these jobs if they didn't have morals and a respect for the law they are just deskjockies.I thought that the acting was welldone and the roles were believable. The script was pretty good and at least there wasn't a bunch of cheesy oneliners and awkward dialogue although I too found that they said foolproof more times than warranted.All in all I would have no problem recommending this to anyone.

Hadn't done much since Hurricane Juan blew through the city so I thought Hey I know nothing about this movie but it should be a good way to kill 90 minutes... I was right...sort of.This movie wasn't bad...it wasn't really good either but Hollow Man it definately was NOT.The premise is a little trite but here it goes. Ryan Reynolds plays Kevin a cutish little cubicle nebbish who in his spare time plans devises and pretends to hack banks jewelry stores and the like with his two friends  Kristen Booth as the wired and angry Samantha and Joris Jarsky as the nerdy unkempt and slimy techie Rob. Let me impress upon you the seriousness of what they do. They stake out places in the beginning of the movie it is a jewelers find out the security systems layout of the place habits of night guards etc. Then in Rob's garage they recreate the scenario of breaking in to the last detail. They get mockups of the security systems measure distances and essentially breaks into the place without actually doing it. They call their little group Foolproof and you know this because a Kevin is an uptight twitchy stickler for the rules who insists everything be followed to the last detail and b they repeat the word every five seconds. Honestly its like going to see Batman and having him say I'm Batman everytime he meets someone new...we get that the movie is called Foolproof you don't need to beat us over the head with it.My main problem in the first five minutes of the movie is that they do not give any screen time explaining how they got layout plans of the building technical specs and blueprints of the building high security system technical and chemical knoeledge enough to be able to recreate and then defeat these systems or any real reason why a bunch of people would do this. They don't seem to be having a lot of fun especially Kevin and they don't explain where all this stuff comes from or where they get the money. Rob is an insurance adjuster so his money isn't exactly rolling in.That and they say the word Foolproof about twenty times...sigh.Enter Leo Gillette also known as Leo The Touch...a flawless maybe foolproof? theif who has stumbled upon their little group stole the plans for the jewlers and used them to perfection to steal the jewels these idiots were only pretending to steal. He then blackmails them into working for him on a new job since their fingerprints are all over the plans. Leo is played quite admirably by David Suchet Hercule Poirot in the series and Geppetto in Roberto Bengini's Pinnochio and he gets these losers to work on his job and put their virtual talents to use. He also apparently starts to win over Rob who is a loser who sees in Leo everything he wants and Leo kind of takes him under his wing a bit.I won't give away any of the ending the actual sequence for the breakins and how they do it is rather well done for such a small Canadian picture and the chemistry between the actors is if not electric at least beleivable. There are a few instances at the big suprise wrap up finish where they explain everything that I had to beat myself on the head saying Stop thinking! Thinking is bad! but suffice to say while it may look good on screen it is utterly unbeleivable...The ending is rather satisfying but in all the premise and execution is rather lame and unbelievable and while the actors do a good job with the roles they are given I care absolutely nothing for any of them. I hope they fail and Leo has them put in cement shoes.Do not pay actual money to see this unless REALLY bored and you have seen every other good movie in the theater go see another one again is my reccomendation and I wouldn't even reccomend it as a renter. Wait until it hits the Movie Network and watch it then...and only if you have nothing else to do.".

I was hoping for it to do well felt the need to cheer for the cinematic home team but after seeing it I tried to understand why so much money was sunk into a film without a chance. AT the heart of the story lies a trio of friends led by the talented Canadian export Ryan Reynolds. They stage foolproof capers as a fun thing to do as friends. This was the first script obstacle which was terribly wonky and hard to get over but we move on. Enter bad guy played with the stereotypical menace by David Souchet another good actor whose talents were wasted by the director. What ensues is a ridiculous story which is so poorly written that the film can't possibly survive it's own running time. It tries to be a high impact crime caper full of twists and turns. The problem is that like many great caper films the script has to be airtight. This script was no where near production ready. Another problem is that Foolproof didn't have the budget that caper films require in order to be successful. They blew their load on one or two scenes and the rest of the film looks like a TV movie. It's sad that this film died such a public death. It makes it so much harder for other Canadian films to get out there. While I admire the risk taken on Foolproof's domestic release I'm saddened that they blew a bunch of cash releasing a mediocre film that never had a chance.".

I wanted to pull for the film but I found it nearly impossible. The script is leaden the actors are flat and the dialogue is horrible. It reminded me of someone's senior thesis from Filmmaking 101 but with a better budget. Every joke is telegraphed no character has any original quality whatsoever and the suspense sequences are completely lifted from everything we've already seen in a hundred other films.I can understand the need for Canadian cinema to compete with American cinema. Personally I'm no big fan of American blockbusters either I look for the small personal quirky films. Fool Proof feels hollow because there's no emotion invested nothing innovative no chemistry. It's apparent from the opening sequence that everyone involved in the production is trying to be cool instead of actually being cool.As a TV series pilot this might not have been bad  expectations are lowered and the characters don't need to be as fleshed out yet as they should be on the big screen. As a multiplex contender I don't think Fool Proof has enough authenticity or points of interest to generate a sincere audience. Perhaps next time the filmmakers should work from their gut rather than with their eyes on the theatergoers' wallets  the same goes for filmmakers around the world.".

The story after all is interesting a couple of people pretending to do heists get caught by reality.With such a plot one takes into account a certain level of disbelief and far fetched events but this movie however takes the level just a bit too far. For example no time is spent on telling how the characters get their extensive knowledge of almost all high tech alarms and a simple picture is enough for them to crack any system. Furthermore these people.. all very young and only one of them seems to have a job have all the latest gadgets available to them... 007 would envy their setup.Even if one takes this as part of the popcorn this movie is  which I didn't there are more disturbing factors.Like the female lead who is about as convincing as Halle Berry in Catwoman with her I am gonna kick his ass attitude. For pure torture rewind the first time she confronts the body guard of the bad guy.. this is so painfully bad it hurts. The bad guy never got caught  at least so is told to us for someone who never got caught he acts stupid the whole movie  some guys must have a lot of luck. No wonder David Suchet looks embarrassed the whole movie.The climax itself has a nice idea behind it  story of this movie lots of nice ideas but the execution makes you shake your head in disbelief. The few twists that are behind it make entrapment a masterpiece.Actually this whole movie feels like an under budget TV pilot. If this is the best Canada has to offer mainstream nowadays I even start to think about rewatching 21 jump street.This film is even lower as the nobrainer it is made to be it doesn't show any respect for its audience and takes itself far too serious. If you have anything better to do with your life.. watching paint dry.. clip your toenails please do it and avoid this stinker.".

Instead I will talk about my impressions.This is a heist movie in the heist genre so don't really expect anything different. The main thing that sets this movie apart from other heist movies I've seen lately is the fact that the characters don't use any blackbox items to aid them in their heist. It is conceivable that actual people could pull off the heists that are set up in the film. Careful planning goes into their ideas and everything must be solved by real solutions not just oh I have this magic device that allows me to bypass the entire security system.I found the plot interesting and more intelligent that most heist movies I've seen recently. Enough twists to keep you guessing but not so many as to annoy the audience. The actors do a great job and I found myself caring about what happened to them. The pace is excellent. The plot never drags but it never really rushes itself.All in all this was a really fun movie to go see. I really enjoyed it. Just don't expect another Canadian art movie from it.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you turned an intelligent writer loose on The Perfect Score or Catch That Kid to gave these traditional heist pictures some Enemy of the State flavor and misdirection and some good dialogue you would end up with something like Foolproof. There is the super secure vault to be cracked by a team of young male and female nonprofessionals. These folks just slightly older than those in the other two films have been playing at being robbers planning and rehearsing elaborate burglary schemes but stopping short of actually putting their plans into action. But a local hood discovers one of their plans and executes it then threatens to frame them for the crime unless they assist him in pulling off a 20 Million heist. This is an 8 Million Canadian production pretty big money for their film industry and almost all of it makes it onto the screen. It actually has a better look than the 80 Million Enemy of the State although they cheat a bit and under light almost every scene. The caper itself is pretty ordinary and obviously overused but the misdirection is very convincing ironically it works best on those most familiar with the conventions of the genre who trap themselves by focusing in on what they think are plot holes. The group includes Ryan Reynolds Kristin Booth and Joris Jarsky all Canadian and all unknown to me. Booth looked familiar like either Tyler Layton or Lindy Boothwho played the airhead student secretary on Relic Hunter. The latter was somewhat correctKristin is Lindy's older sister. In the case of Foolproof she was the reason for most of my enjoyment. Reynolds and Jarsky are competent and do all that is required of them but Booth's performance cements everything together. There is no interesting scene or sequence in which she does not have a central part. The DVD is probably the way to go as the deleted scenes actually contain funnier jokes than those that make it into the final cut. The rest of the cast is pretty much of the mediocre quality that you find in this type of film no matter the budget. It's not the sort of challenging film that attracts a really talented actor. Had Foolproof starred a big name or had an aggressive marketing campaign it could have caught on and made some moneyits better than two thirds of heavily promoted films that do make it to the typical megaplex. Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.".

I think the female lead is the most powerful performer she has a great look and a wonderful presence on screen. Ryan Reynolds give one of his better performances while the bad guy has a nasty evil to him. I have watched this movie a couple of times and it never fails to keep me watching plus the ending has to be watched closely ala the usual suspects.

Ryan Reynolds give one of his better performances while the bad guy has a nasty evil to him. I have watched this movie a couple of times and it never fails to keep me watching plus the ending has to be watched closely ala the usual suspects. Just sit back and enjoy for this movie is worth the watch.";

The movie is actually so good and so bad at the same time. It's because this movie exhibits the best and the worst qualities that we get passionately critical of it. It's like taking a '71 Hemi'cuda and painting it with a roller. Some of the acting was excellent and David Suchet blew my mind as 'Leo Gillette'. The intensity of that character kept me on the edge of my seat. The use of symbolism was a tasty touch as well. Unfortunately Ryan Reynold's character Kevin wasn't fullyrealized and all exchanges between the two just seemed wrong. Van Wilder just didn't realize enough of his own talent potential at the time of this production. One of my own bug bears is weapon use. In this movie Leo fired a .45 cal Glock like it was a cap gun 5 shots or so. He had No idea that he was firing blanks. He never even suspected. I've fired a .45 pistol. That thing is a beast! Blanks? Not even in the same postal code. How about falling 40 floors and still being alive. I hate to be graphic but not only would you be dead...you would be in many pieces... non of which would have the intact bones to hold up a gun. Modern within the last 40 years elevators also have 4 independent brakes to prevent free fall. None of which occurred to this Mastermind and to the protagonists who predicted his elaborate plan to destroy them. In the end the three turn the tables on Leo and run off with the diamonds with nary a care in the world. I'm sorry but Leo is 'Hannibal Lector' in everything but diet. A set of bars wouldn't make me feel safe enough. Maybe get a major tan and go live with a tribe in the Amazon?".

Sublime spiritual yet on occasion ruthless  Senna conquers and transcends Formula One to become a global superstar. Privately he is humble almost shy and fiercely patriotic donating millions to his native Brasil and contemplating a life beyond motorracing. Yet he is struck down in his prime on the blackest weekend in the history of the sport watched live on television by 300 million people. Years on he is revered in Formula One as the greatest motor racing driver of all time  and in Brasil as a Saint.";

Maybe in the past you've been coerced by this sort of leadon by a friend or significant other only to suffer and moan. I asked my wife while leaving the Paramount Theater if she enjoyed the movie. My wonderful accommodating supportive wife who has absolutely no interest in racing whatsoever strike whatsoever  I think she might have an unhealthy andor impure appreciation of Mark Webber and Jenson Button responded How could you not? From across the theater my friend Eric whose interest in sports essentially begins and ends with the University of Arkansas Razorbacks hallowed be thy name flashed two thumbs up then pantomimed tears falling. Then two more thumbs up so as not to end his review on an unmanly note.Ultimately my appreciation of Senna derives from the perspective of how it immortalizes Ayrton Senna a god among men as a human being. If you're disinclined to be all gungho about a documentary I have some encouragement. Kapadia forgoes the typical talking head television style interview with someone who knew Senna recounting their experiences and memories. Instead he lets the characters primarily nemesis Alain Prost McLaren team boss Ron Dennis and of course Senna himself tell the story more or less chronologically and in the moment. With hundreds of hours of footage available from interview to candid behind the scenes to incar supplemented by more recent interviews specifically for the film the narrative of Senna's rise to the pinnacle of the racing world is already extensively documented and well known at least in a mythological sense. The drive and focus of that narrative then is a masterstroke of tireless research and judicious editing. Senna is undeniably a good film full stop.Senna as the protagonist in the drama develops as thoroughly as a character in any of the best films you could name. One of the most controversial moments of his career the infamous shunt with Alain Prost our lead antagonist at the 1990 Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka is suddenly recontextualized from its usual portrayal with the background to color the incident accurately you could argue as a righteous middle finger to the sport's governing body and particularly its then demagogue of a master JeanMarie Balestre. In many circles purists will cluck and bemoan the unsporting intent of Senna's defiance by charging for a gap and holding a line that would likely and in fact did retire both drivers from the race. The crash brought cheers from the audience in the theater. Senna went on to clinch the championship. Unsportsmanlike or the very illustration of competitive purity? There's room to argue but the context underlying the whole ordeal is undeniable. My favorite sequence and the one that honestly caused something to get in my eye was the 1991 Brazil Grand Prix. Piloting a broken car but having never won in his home country Senna drove an impossible drive to cling to his victory. If the story ended here it would be Roy Hobbs slamming the ball into the lights. Senna winning in Brazil exemplifies my theory that athletic competition can be art or at least artistic. Senna's drive was a pure expression of the human spirit and it is beautiful to behold. Seriously truthfully beautiful. If you could package this segment of the film a model of Michelangelo's David and maybe a recording of Mingus Ah Um and send it all into space for aliens to understand what humanity is and is capable of you wouldn't be doing the universe a disservice. Watching the footage of him on the winners' podium in sheer agony try and fail then try again to hoist his trophy over his head and knowing that he wasn't doing so out of a need to satisfy his ego but to salute his country and its citizens  it's moving. But this is all a bit like the Titanic isn't it? Most racing fans know what happened to Ayrton Senna on May 1 1994. We know every race every victory brings us closer to The Monster at the End of This Book. Few serious accidents are shown in the film. Only the outcome of Martin Donnelly's career ending but amazingly not fatal 1990 crash is shown his broken body lying motionless on the circuit. It's a nauseatingly frank shot. Rubens Barrichello's airborne shunt during practice at Imola in '94 that ranks in the majority of morbid but somehow requite top 10 crashes of all time lists. Roland Ratzenberger's fatal crash at qualifying for the same race. And finally Senna. It's jarring even when you know it's coming.Throughout the film are shots of Niki Lauda. Although he's never named either in narration or by subtitle the burn scarred face of the threetime world champion and still competitive driver at the time is a frequent looming reminder of the supposedly bygone age when the life expectancy of F1 drivers was not the job's mot vital selling point. But in the modern era no one expected the greatest driver possibly in the history of the sport could be snuffed with so little effort on the part of the universe. It was tragic and will always be tragic like the last man to die in the battle before a truce is called but that doesn't make it senseless. If the Spirit of Racing Future floated down to Senna and handed him a signed declaration of his impending death he'd likely have strapped into his wobbly Williams and tempted the Almighty's resolve. Because that loving thankful but nonetheless defiant middle finger to the institution he loved so much whether we're talking racing or God defined him as a human.".

But this is all a bit like the Titanic isn't it? Most racing fans know what happened to Ayrton Senna on May 1 1994. We know every race every victory brings us closer to The Monster at the End of This Book. Few serious accidents are shown in the film. Only the outcome of Martin Donnelly's career ending but amazingly not fatal 1990 crash is shown his broken body lying motionless on the circuit. It's a nauseatingly frank shot. Rubens Barrichello's airborne shunt during practice at Imola in '94 that ranks in the majority of morbid but somehow requite top 10 crashes of all time lists. Roland Ratzenberger's fatal crash at qualifying for the same race. And finally Senna. It's jarring even when you know it's coming.Throughout the film are shots of Niki Lauda. Although he's never named either in narration or by subtitle the burn scarred face of the threetime world champion and still competitive driver at the time is a frequent looming reminder of the supposedly bygone age when the life expectancy of F1 drivers was not the job's mot vital selling point. But in the modern era no one expected the greatest driver possibly in the history of the sport could be snuffed with so little effort on the part of the universe. It was tragic and will always be tragic like the last man to die in the battle before a truce is called but that doesn't make it senseless. If the Spirit of Racing Future floated down to Senna and handed him a signed declaration of his impending death he'd likely have strapped into his wobbly Williams and tempted the Almighty's resolve. Because that loving thankful but nonetheless defiant middle finger to the institution he loved so much whether we're talking racing or God defined him as a human.";

Most of these don't interest me too much and I sometimes despair that they will ever show anything like this. So you can imagine my surprise when the weekly email I receive from them listing the upcoming films included this little gem. I've had it on 'The List' that's my 'To See' list for those that don't know for some time and always thought I'd end up seeing it on TV. But no the Picture House are showing it! Admittedly it's only for two screenings but they're actually showing a film I never thought I'd see on the big screen.Two of us went to the first screening myself a Formula One fan for many years and my buddy Dave who isn't into Formula One but is a bit of a connoisseur of film. He had heard about this one and was interested to give it the once over. The film tells the story of the Brazilian driver Ayrton Senna from his early days in carting through his rise to fame and fortune in Formula One to his untimely death in an accident in 1994. We are told about the feud he had with fellow driver Alain Prost and the battles they had both on and off the track. How he dealt with the politics of the sport and how he became a huge star giving hope to millions back home in Brasil. And also the thoughts of those involved in his life and career.I love the way this film was put together there is no commentary and no interviews with people made after the fact. It's all archive footage and interviews mostly with Senna himself that tells the story. As has been said many time before real life can be so much better than fiction and this story has so much drama and emotion in it I firmly believe in this case at least it's true. The section of the film concerning his death I remember watching events unfold live on TV very well. It was the blackest day on Formula One history and I don't think I'll ever forget it. In the film it is very emotional and even Dave admitted to shedding a manly tear at one point.To many Ayrton Senna was the greatest driver ever to race in Formula One. I'll admit that I wasn't his greatest fan when he raced I wanted the British drivers to win of course. I always admired his talent though and now I know more about him I am inclined to think that yes he was one of the greatest. This is a truly remarkable film and one I can highly recommend to fans of the sport and those that don't follow it. It's a remarkable story and one I'm sure you will find yourself thinking about for a long time afterwards.My Score 9.210".

Directed by Asif Kapadia 'Far North' 'The Warrior' and produced by Universal and Working Title 'Senna' shows the audience the untapped potential and brilliance of the Formula 1 driver Ayrton Senna while also examining the rise of this shy young Brazillian boy from gokarting circuits to a televisual audience of millions. 'Senna' is as moving and touching as it is interesting and captivating.Born Ayrton Senna da Silva to wealthy middleclass parents in the Santana district of Sao Paulo he always had a dream of becoming a racing driver and began by driving in the Karting World Championships until he was approached to join Formula 3 for the 1983 season and then Formula 1 for the following season. From his first controversial podium finish in the Monaco in Grand Prix in 1984 two things were born an intense rivalry with the future French Formula 1 champion and soon to be teammate Alain Prost and a desire to race dominate and win which would see Senna not only claim three World Championships but also lose his own life on the track.Where Kapadia's 'Senna' documentary works is in its ability to appeal to wide array of audience members. For the fans of the Formula 1 racing there is a copious amount of footage documenting select races and the events taking place around his career. Rather than use cutaway segments to show various celebrities and sports men and women discuss their memories and recollections of Senna Kapadia instead utilises a voiceover to accompany the archive images onscreen. By allowing the voiceover of the various people associated with Senna most notable this consists of McLaren's team principal Ron Dennis his mother father and sister F1 team Doctor Sid Watkins and Brazilian commentator Reginaldo Leme to supplement the footage it both preserves he power of the onscreen image and provides the audience with additional information regarding the situation or event that is being presented.While for the casual viewer who may only know of Ayrton Senna in passing there is the psychological unravelling of a man trapped in a boy's body. Senna is shown not to be ignorant of the politics of Formula 1 but simply uninterested he was always that middleclass boy from Brazil who only wanted to race win and repeat. There is also an interesting inclusion of footage of Senna as a modern hero of the Brazilian people he's shown as the racing driver who transcended the social and political problems of a nation on the edge of poverty and economic instability and provided them with ray of light and joy that was unfortunately extinguished on the 1st of May 1994. 'Senna' is a brilliant and moving examination of a rising sporting star caught up in the whirlwind of politics rivalries and stardom when all he wanted to do was race and win by any means necessary not for the adulation of millions but his love for sport so close to his heart.".

	schema:headline " I was concerned it wouldn't live up to the hype and was happily proved wrong!";
	schema:reviewBody "As somebody who was 4 months short of my 9th birthday when I saw the news update reporting Senna's death I had been waiting years for a movie to be made about his life. My growing years were spent regretting that I didn't follow the great mans' career for longer and so I made up for lost time after his death accumulating as much information on his F1 dynasty and his life outside F1 as I could. It got to that point where you feel as if you know knew somebody very well despite never meeting them.When I heard that a movie was being made about Senna I couldn't wait but at the same time I worried that it may not do his life justice. Having seen the movie at last it's definitely one to watch even if you don't follow motorsport. The editing is sharp enough to keep even the most casual viewer interested which is all the more impressive considering 'Senna' is made up entirely of archival footage.The movie is an emotional rollercoaster from start to finish however the only time I felt close to shedding tears was when he finally won the Brazilian Grand Prix. It's a pity they didn't mention it in the film but only a few hundred metres after crossing the finish line his gearbox conked out and the car coasted to a halt. That's how close it was. It was truly meant to be the day he won and you would be hard pressed not to get caught up in the enormity of the moment even if like me you had seen it plenty of times before.To that final weekend at Imola and although I had seen much of the footage a number of times before for the first time I had the feeling of actually being there and living through the events taking place. Strangely I found Ratzenberger's death more harrowing than Senna's. Perhaps it was because I have seen Senna's death and events before after it many times on TV or youtube but for the first time Ratzenberger is presented as more than just that other guy who was killed the day before Senna and instead as an actual person taking part in a sport he loved and doing the best he could in an inferior car.I give this movie 910. It misses a mark for some minor details that would only interest a hardcore F1 buff like myself Virtually no mention vox pops of Mansell a great rival of Senna's on the circuit he was Prosts' Ferrari teammate in 1990 and in his autobiography called him the lowest human being I have ever met. This would have given a more balanced view of Prost and shown that it was not just Senna and his fans who were disdainful of Prost. Berger Senna's teammate after Prost and a close friend and Murray Walker for so long the voice of Formula 1 would have been welcome inclusions as well.The dates are occasionally wrong e.g the 1991 Brazilian Grand Prix was on the 24th of March and not the 21st which incidentally was Ayrton's 31st birthday. Another incorrect detail is when onboard footage of Senna qualifying in the 1990 McLaren at Monaco is shown while the caption claims it is from the 1988 race. Occasionally the engine note doesn't match the incar footage and has clearly been lifted from other footage. These are tiny details but considering the effort that went into the rest of the documentary it's a shame they didn't clean those bits up.Surely time could have been found in the film to include Senna's battle with Mansell at Monaco in '92 and his masterful wet weather display at Donington in '93? And although footage of Senna racing to the aid of Comas's wrecked Ligier features in the end credits it would have been great to have included it in the actual feature itself linking it with Donnelly's accident to emphasize the concern Ayrton had for the welfare of the other drivers.Those are my only reasons for not giving this film a perfect 10 and they are only minor reasons admittedly. I am already looking forward to seeing this movie again. If you haven't seen 'Senna' yet watch it as soon as you get the chance. One of those inspirational films that stays in your head after you see it leaves an impact and then leaves an even bigger impact when you remember that everything you saw really did happen.".

	onyx:emotionText "As somebody who was 4 months short of my 9th birthday when I saw the news update reporting Senna's death I had been waiting years for a movie to be made about his life. My growing years were spent regretting that I didn't follow the great mans' career for longer and so I made up for lost time after his death accumulating as much information on his F1 dynasty and his life outside F1 as I could. It got to that point where you feel as if you know knew somebody very well despite never meeting them.When I heard that a movie was being made about Senna I couldn't wait but at the same time I worried that it may not do his life justice. Having seen the movie at last it's definitely one to watch even if you don't follow motorsport. The editing is sharp enough to keep even the most casual viewer interested which is all the more impressive considering 'Senna' is made up entirely of archival footage.The movie is an emotional rollercoaster from start to finish however the only time I felt close to shedding tears was when he finally won the Brazilian Grand Prix. It's a pity they didn't mention it in the film but only a few hundred metres after crossing the finish line his gearbox conked out and the car coasted to a halt. That's how close it was. It was truly meant to be the day he won and you would be hard pressed not to get caught up in the enormity of the moment even if like me you had seen it plenty of times before.To that final weekend at Imola and although I had seen much of the footage a number of times before for the first time I had the feeling of actually being there and living through the events taking place.

Almost 20 years after his death the true intricacies that embroiled his career and personal life have yet to be unraveled however this movie does a hell of a job connecting the two in perfect harmony. A bitter sweet taste is left in the mouth of the viewer as they watch a film with subtle undertones of competitiveness and strong hues of emotion. A soulful film you really find yourself unraveling the charisma and Jues De Vivre that is Senna. From the offset of the movie you find yourself in a somewhat cheerful unknowing state as it lightly unravels his early career in Formula 1 whilst hinting at the precursors that led him there. The hard pressing and very tight competition of him against Proust is another aspect that the viewer will find to be nail biting as you truly begin to see the emotional aspect of Senna open at this point. Thus the ending could come to a heartbreak to someone who had never heard of Senna. But alas the legacy that lasts transcends all documentaries and all books. For the truly afflicted carracing fan such as myself you feel torn and yet very motivated to be the best you can be. To the regular viewer you feel emotionally attached to a man who affected the lives of millions positively in his home country of Brazil. A perfect mix of a movie in which you can watch as either an autoracing fan or someone who has never heard of Senna It delivers on a highly emotional level surrounding you in the warmth that he brought to many.".

Reliving those moments on the big screen was a truly exhilarating and tearjerking experience.I have consumed volumes of Sennarelated material over the years so to say that this film adds something substantive means a lot. Of course the stories themselves won't be new to a lot of motor racing fans but there is something delicious and comforting in the retelling of a beautiful fable. And the film makers are to be congratulated for paring a complex story down to its dramatic essentials while maintaining the necessary context and without reducing it to a Hollywood narrative. They certainly did a much better job of conveying what Senna was to my girlfriend than I could ever do. The fact that she thoroughly enjoyed the film  and came out of it with a good understanding of many of the nuances of Senna's life  despite being ardently antiracing speaks volumes.If I have any criticism it is the lack of audiovisual sync up in many of the onboard shots. And in one shot there are audible gear changes when Senna is supposedly stuck in sixth gear. For the casual viewer these count for little but for a racing connoisseur these mistakes are like nails on a chalkboard. It's hard to believe that the film was previewed by anyone with a deep understanding of motor sport. One could also criticize the film for telling only one side of a complex history Senna's but given the film's scope that is no fault at all in my opinion.All in all this is a beautiful documentary. It is wellpaced with a perfect running time and wonderful score. I highly recommend it to racing fans and film fans alike.".

Senna does just that armed only with hours of archive footage a magnificent soundtrack and a compelling tale of triumph and despair.Admittedly I'm obsessed with Formula 1 so I naturally made it my priority to go and see this film a priority requiring me to go to a cinema on the far side of the country. I was aware of the major success that this movie was but I needed to see it for myself to believe. I wasn't disappointed. It was absolutely incredible! The first 5 minutes warrant patience as the movie kicks into gear but from there on in it is a piece of cinematic genius.The array of unseen footage included in the film was a huge surprise for me and is seriously useful for unraveling the enigma that is Ayrton Senna throughout the movie. It really focuses on his intense rivalry with Alain Prost throughout the movie. It was the defining rivalry of their era as the greatest drivers of their generation went toe to toe for supremacy within the McLaren team. It also brings to light the unseen element of Senna the devout Christian the man who felt a deep humanitarian responsibility to his native people in Brazil. In the midst of an unfair regime and national poverty Senna was a glimmer of hope to all.When the clips of May 1 1994 were echoed around the cinema I could fell the buildup of tears in my eyes and as it showed Alain Prost holding Senna's helmet at the funeral and the streets lined by thousands upon thousands upon thousands to try and get a glimpse of their godly sporting superstar it was all too much. As the credits rolled so did the outburst of emotion. Not only is this film recommendable for anybody with a burning passion for motor sport but for anybody with the slightest bit of compassion anybody who has a soul and anybody who possesses life.

	schema:reviewBody "Senna is often remembered as the greatest racing driver of all times not only in Formula1 but in Motorsports. However not a lot of people know about his life or even his racing which ended in 1994. These days one would just look at his records andor some YouTube footage of his races to gain an insight on the man. Even I belong in this category. I never got to see any of Senna's race on TV. I looked at his records and never understood why he was often called the greatest racing driver who ever lived. Well now I do. This movie shows why he is one of the greatest racing drivers of all times. This is a beautiful movie. It is mostly a documentary and consists of a lot of racing footage and interviews by Senna and several other people in F1 during his time. There is good amount soundtrack throughout it though which gives it more of a movie feel than a documentary. It is also the best documentary I have ever watched. The more you watch it the more you gain perspective towards life of a man who was truly a legend. Don't dismiss this even if you are not into F1 or Motorsports. I think the beginning 20 minutes maybe hard to follow for someone who isn't into racing but it's mostly the event in Senna's life his attitude and his intensity that make this documentary so interesting. The movie is very intense and almost left me in tears at the end rarely happens with a documentary. Also this movie has quickly become very popular among racing fans all over the world. If you follow F1 like me then you will hear many references to Senna and this movie every now and then so it's almost a necessity to watch this. Overall a great documentary and I could watch this in a movie theater if they play.".

It is amazing how they pulled off such a feat and it really added to the film's unique feel. You're essentially seeing everything described in the documentary as it happened. It really does add a lot of emotion to it. The ending is extremely powerful. It shows Senna's crash and what follows is a really emotional montage of the distress and sorrow it caused in Brazil.

	schema:reviewBody "I have just come back from the cinema which had at a rough estimate 150 people watching this film. This is quite amazing since the last time I shared that screen with so many people was the Star Trek reboot in the first week after opening! For a documentary this seems to be very popular.First of all a disclaimer  I'm a diedinthewool petrolhead and have been since before Senna entered F1. It was therefore with some trepidation that I went to see this documentary because I wondered what liberties might have been taken with history in order to paint a picture of Senna and by implication the sport. I'm pleased to say that I was not disappointed  this film captured many of my memories of the time very well.My biggest criticism is that the film is too short  a few more minutes would have painted a different picture of Senna's relationship with other drivers. Sure the focus on the SennaProst battle is understandable but some time spent showing how they reconciled after Prost resigned would have been nice. Also the fact that Senna's humanity amply demonstrated with regard to the people of his country could have been underlined with regard to his fellow drivers by giving some time to the briefly seen in the end credits incident where he stopped his car on the track and ran back to assist Eric Comas following an accident at Spa in 1992.Perhaps the film is a little harsh on Alain Prost but as I wrote earlier this documentary captures my memories well. Prost was a difficult driver to like because he was always so calculating I have the same opinion of Michael Schumacher  I don't want coldblooded winners I want ones where I am not sure what is going to happen but was he really as bad as painted here? I'm not sure.This film is very accessible  there were a lot of people in the cinema who were probably not alive when Senna died and they seemed to be as affected by the drama as I was. The accidents that took the lives of Ratzenberger and Senna in the same weekend are truly horrifying on the big screen  and I remember seeing them when they happened  and I was not the only one dabbing at my eyes after each one.To cut a long story short  I hope the DVD has a director's cut with a lot more about a man who could have done so much had he lived longer.".

There's very little cuts to show interviewees talking mostly its just their voice in the background and the camera will be showing footage of Senna or from Senna's perspectives. Its makes for a very engrossing movie you feel like you are living through Senna's life bit by bit and understanding his troubles his competition his interest his dreams and his happiness.In the start of the film we see the competition between Senna and another great driver Prost and this is captured magnificently. But as the film progresses the thing that makes this film so great is that we begin to realise that the real obstacle the real competitor that these young men faced were the cars and the race itself. Despite knowing the dangers involved the drivers still race and we admire them for this.My heart was beating loudly in the final sequences of the film you'll know what I mean. The onboard cockpit views shows the legendary speed with which Senna tackled the road. Its truly amazing.".

Much like Julian Temple's Sex Pistols music documentary encompassed the climate of the times looked at the press and public reactions to something making waves in the entertainment world so too Senna is dealing with more than a big name racing driver who tragically lost his life at Imola racing circuit in 1994. Director Asif Kapadi and his team have constructed an in depth and poignant picture that follows Ayrton Senna of Brazil from his humble Karting beginnings right up to that fateful day on 1st May 94 when a country as one sank to its knees in mourning for the man who was their one joy in a country full of hurt and political confusion.Ayrton was a genius in the rain.On the drivingracing side the fascination comes from learning how Senna pushed himself to greatness a very driven man who was never shy in coming forward. He challenged authority when needed and his on going career spat with Alain Prost often made the news for the wrong reasons these are insightful and excellent splinters of the film. Incredible feats achieved in the car like how he finally achieved one of his greatest ambitions and won the Brazillian Grand Prix with a broken gear box stuck in 6th gear! Things he did seemed like magic to his millions of fans very religious he felt very close to God some of his driving had the air of a deity about it! Of course it's all building towards the tragedy where it hits hard and even there there's a mysticism about proceedings. Foreboding warnings that came when Austrian driver Roland Ratzenberger was killed the day before Senna the Brazillian's reaction unerringly prophetic.He would take the car beyond its design capabilities.It's not warts and all Kapadi has said that the Senna family oversaw production and much of the maverick driver's persona has been smoothed over. It's also worth mentioning that it's no rags to riches story Senna was no Slumdog about to become a Millionaire. But this is real a real man with a real interesting story a story strung together with real clips and real home footage not some hack job where a number of people from the same field share their own thoughts on a star that no longer shines. The Bluray release offers both an extended cut and the theatrical release the former contains an extra hour but nothing of significance is gained. That cut is probably more for die hard F1 fans. At 1hr 45m the theatrical cut does an exceptional job by always being compelling with not a dull moment in sight. Quite simply this is one of the best sports person documentaries out there. 910".

If Kanner had channelled his talents more intelligently and disciplined himself he could have been the British version of James Dean.At the end of the film Bette Davis and Michael Redgrave walk past a theatre poster for a play starring an actress named Margo Channing the character Davis played in All About Eve'. This wasn't a very good injoke as it reminds us of a film that's much better than Connecting Rooms' in which Bette Davis gives a much better performance than she does here.

Life is just a coffee grinder and we're the coffee bean is one of the pieces of advice Davis gives Kanner and indeed their relationship seems as strange as the literary quotes she drops. It's obvious that Davis's lovely character is suffering from desperate loneliness and it's very parallel to her real life that she utilized as the title of one of her autobiographies The Lonely Life. Davis herself said in her old age that if she were to become involved with a man again it would be a much younger one and that is a very interesting comparison to her life here.

	schema:headline " 'Station' mixes farce and tragedy to fairly good effect";
	schema:reviewBody "'The Last Station' focuses on the last year in the life of Leo Tolstoy the great Russian novelist. Toward the end of his life Tolstoy began promulgating a secular religious philosophy based on the Christian teachings of 'turning the other cheek' and helping one's fellow man. He advocated pacifism and urged members of the upper class to attend to the needs of the indigent. A cultlike group of anarchists The Tolstoyans headed by Vladimir Chertkov insinuated themselves into Tolstoy's life and set up a commune of followers near Tolstoy's country estate. The plot of 'The Last Station' is relatively simple. Chertkov hires a young pacifist Valentin Bulgakov James McAvoy to work as Tolstoy's secretary but in reality act as his spy. Valentin is instructed to write down everything the master says and relay all garnered information back to Chertkov. The Tolstoyans have high and mighty ideals about spreading Tolstoy's message but the leadership are a bunch of prigs insisting that all members of the commune lead ascetic lives as celibates. At first Valentin wears his virginity as a badge of honor but soon falls for the free spirited Masha Kerry Condon who seduces him. Masha soon grows disillusioned with the 'movement' as she cannot abide by their rigid rules.Tolstoy appears to be much more openminded than his followers and laughs at Valentin when he admits that he's a virgin. Nonetheless it's never really explained in much detail why Tolstoy is attracted to his 'Tolstoyans'. There's some talk about Tolstoy being impressed by Chertkov's ability to get his message out to as many people as possible. By the same token Tolstoy cannot be unaware that his followers deep down are a bunch of reactionaries.It's his longsuffering wife Sofya who sees through Chertkov and his minions and clashes with her husband about her suspicions that he might be changing his will in favor of his obsessed followers. Her fears are realized when Tolstoy agrees to sign away all his copyrights so that the Russian people can read his books for free. This outrages Sofya since she was counting on having the family receive the inheritance.Three quarters of 'The Last Station' is played primarily as a farce. Helen Mirren intentionally serves up an overthetop performance as Sofya the overemotional countess who would probably be diagnosed today as bipolar. While Sofya correctly sees through Chertkov's machinations her emotional outbursts end up alienating her husband who finally has had enough and decides to leave his estate.The last quarter of the film the more serious part chronicles Tolstoy's last days as he ends up the subject of intense media scrutiny. Buoyed by his followers along with his devoted daughter Tolstoy is given lodging by a kindly stationmaster after disembarking from a train in southern Russia. Meanwhile Sofya tries to commit suicide by jumping in a pond back at the Tolstoy estate. The suicide attempt fails and she soon learns of Tolstoy's aborted trip and that he's now dying. She races to see her stricken husband but Chertkov and her daughter prevent her from seeing him on his death bed. Finally as he draws his last breaths the daughter allows her mother to pay her last respects. 'The Last Station' is most successful in the scenes where Helen Mirren is battling the Tolstoyans. Two scenes come to mind right away where Sofya falls through the window and rages against Chertkov as they plot to divert the family inheritance and when Sofya fires a gun multiple times at Chertkov's picture. There's also quite a bit of nice interplay between Plummer and Mirren as the Tolstoy's lovehate relationship is dissected in high relief. Paul Giamatti is one of the best American character actors out there today and does a fine job of playing up the comical aspects of the petty tyrant Chertkov. But Chertkov remains unexplaineddoes he have any redeeming characteristics or is he a pure villain? when Giamatti keeps twirling his moustache we're inclined to believe that he is indeed the principal villain of the piece. James McAvoy doesn't have much to work with in the part of Valentin who's depicted as a Nervous Nellie who eventually and rather predictably joins up with Masha and leaves the Tolstoyan cult for good. One thing is for sure Christopher Plummer can do no wrong as Tolstoy when is Plummer ever bad in a part? 'The Last Station' is well written but by no means should it be considered 'highbrow'. The idea that the wellintentioned ideas of a creative man such as Tolstoy could be so easily corrupted by a group of cultlike anarchistic followers is never explored seriously. Instead the film's scenarists are bemused by both Tolstoy's followers and family members and view their machinations more as farce than serious drama. Only in the last scene where Sofya expresses her undying love for her husband who has just expired does 'The Last Station' rise to the heights of deep emotion.'The Last Station' will certainly keep your interest from beginning to end. And please pay attention to the closing credits where the actual motion pictures of Tolstoy walking around on his country estate are shown.".

The plot of 'The Last Station' is relatively simple. Chertkov hires a young pacifist Valentin Bulgakov James McAvoy to work as Tolstoy's secretary but in reality act as his spy. Valentin is instructed to write down everything the master says and relay all garnered information back to Chertkov. The Tolstoyans have high and mighty ideals about spreading Tolstoy's message but the leadership are a bunch of prigs insisting that all members of the commune lead ascetic lives as celibates. At first Valentin wears his virginity as a badge of honor but soon falls for the free spirited Masha Kerry Condon who seduces him. Masha soon grows disillusioned with the 'movement' as she cannot abide by their rigid rules.Tolstoy appears to be much more openminded than his followers and laughs at Valentin when he admits that he's a virgin. Nonetheless it's never really explained in much detail why Tolstoy is attracted to his 'Tolstoyans'. There's some talk about Tolstoy being impressed by Chertkov's ability to get his message out to as many people as possible. By the same token Tolstoy cannot be unaware that his followers deep down are a bunch of reactionaries.It's his longsuffering wife Sofya who sees through Chertkov and his minions and clashes with her husband about her suspicions that he might be changing his will in favor of his obsessed followers. Her fears are realized when Tolstoy agrees to sign away all his copyrights so that the Russian people can read his books for free. This outrages Sofya since she was counting on having the family receive the inheritance.Three quarters of 'The Last Station' is played primarily as a farce. Helen Mirren intentionally serves up an overthetop performance as Sofya the overemotional countess who would probably be diagnosed today as bipolar. While Sofya correctly sees through Chertkov's machinations her emotional outbursts end up alienating her husband who finally has had enough and decides to leave his estate.The last quarter of the film the more serious part chronicles Tolstoy's last days as he ends up the subject of intense media scrutiny. Buoyed by his followers along with his devoted daughter Tolstoy is given lodging by a kindly stationmaster after disembarking from a train in southern Russia. Meanwhile Sofya tries to commit suicide by jumping in a pond back at the Tolstoy estate. The suicide attempt fails and she soon learns of Tolstoy's aborted trip and that he's now dying. She races to see her stricken husband but Chertkov and her daughter prevent her from seeing him on his death bed. Finally as he draws his last breaths the daughter allows her mother to pay her last respects. 'The Last Station' is most successful in the scenes where Helen Mirren is battling the Tolstoyans. Two scenes come to mind right away where Sofya falls through the window and rages against Chertkov as they plot to divert the family inheritance and when Sofya fires a gun multiple times at Chertkov's picture. There's also quite a bit of nice interplay between Plummer and Mirren as the Tolstoy's lovehate relationship is dissected in high relief. Paul Giamatti is one of the best American character actors out there today and does a fine job of playing up the comical aspects of the petty tyrant Chertkov. But Chertkov remains unexplaineddoes he have any redeeming characteristics or is he a pure villain? when Giamatti keeps twirling his moustache we're inclined to believe that he is indeed the principal villain of the piece. James McAvoy doesn't have much to work with in the part of Valentin who's depicted as a Nervous Nellie who eventually and rather predictably joins up with Masha and leaves the Tolstoyan cult for good. One thing is for sure Christopher Plummer can do no wrong as Tolstoy when is Plummer ever bad in a part? 'The Last Station' is well written but by no means should it be considered 'highbrow'. The idea that the wellintentioned ideas of a creative man such as Tolstoy could be so easily corrupted by a group of cultlike anarchistic followers is never explored seriously. Instead the film's scenarists are bemused by both Tolstoy's followers and family members and view their machinations more as farce than serious drama. Only in the last scene where Sofya expresses her undying love for her husband who has just expired does 'The Last Station' rise to the heights of deep emotion.'The Last Station' will certainly keep your interest from beginning to end. And please pay attention to the closing credits where the actual motion pictures of Tolstoy walking around on his country estate are shown.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Last Station is described as a melodrama  and I would say that's a fair description. It's the kind of film they don't really make any more. The spirit of David Lean lives on. It's beautiful to look at for a start and the music is genuinely incidental lushing away in the background. We all know that Leo Tolstoy wrote a book although few of us have the nerve to actually sit down and get to grips with War And Peace. But there was more to the great man than that  in his time he was regarded as godlike and enjoyed a fairly big cult following the Tolstoyan Movement devoted to goodness purity and equality  as long as it didn't mean the end of the deferential lower classes. Tolstoy's young secretary Valentin is dropped into this at the deep end. The 19th century Russian hippies the fanatically devious disciple Chertkov who wants the great man to sign away the rights to his work to the Russian People the hardpressed but manipulative wife determined to keep it in the family. And the girl who introduces the young man to the pleasures of the flesh. It's a great cast headed by the unrecognisable Christopher Plummer and the always marvelous Helen Mirren. The constant undertone in Tolstoy's saga is the disparity between his wish for a good life for the peasants and the sight of those peasants beavering away in the background while the upper classes get on with their lives of pampered angst.It's the growing struggle between the disciple and the wife with the secretary pulled between new and conflicting loyalties that will grab your attention. You really will care about these people. And what follows is the melodrama. I will say no more except that it's a big story told big. Just what Norma Desmond told us we had lost.".

The main tension comes between Vladimir who wants Tolstoy to bequeath his copyrights to The Russian People and Sofya who naturally would like the copyrights reserved for herself and family.Mirren earned an Oscar nomination for Lead Actress and Plummer received one for Supporting Actor. I believe both were well earned. I liked the performance from the entire cast particularly McAvoy as the adoring Assistant to Tolstoy. The screenplay was excellent and the Director Michael Hoffman did an outstanding job bringing preCommunist Russia to life. The time period is 1910 and the cinematography beautifully captured the era.

I realize however that that is not the norm in modern movies and I certainly had no problems following what was going on without it. Viewers such as myself will just have to go read a book about Tolstoy for that additional information which is certainly not a bad thing.This is not a film for the ages a Citizen Kane or a Rules of the Game a Potemkin or such.

Nothing is wrong with this film technically.An extraordinary narrative beautifully adapted by the director Michael Hoffman is one of the crowning achievements of his career. Dedicating his all for the sake of the art form Hoffman writes and directs the screen with meticulousness and accuracy. Playing that extra special detail to smooth out an rough edges paid off for Hoffman immensely.The cast presented in The Last Station is stellar and one of the best cast ensembles of the 2009. James McAvoy proving once again that you don't just lay down the words of your acting you let the spirit fight its way through your soul and remain a tangible entity for your audience to engage. McAvoy proves he's one of Hollywood's most outstanding talents. Helen Mirren riding the seesaw with her viewers never declares any type of emotion until the bitter end. Mirren shows no apparent ambiance of mood or expression. She sizzles through the film igniting every scene on fire along the way. Christopher Plummer as the lovable Leo is amiable captivating and entrancing. Plummer a talent long overdue for Oscar recognition is enticing. Paul Giamatti in a more villainous role we haven't seen of him before is always dependable and alluring. AnneMarie Duff and Kerry Condon are both enthralling in their roles respectively.The Last Station is a definite contender for a Best Picture nomination.

I understand that the tensions between Tolstoy his wife and the Tolstoyans that the film focused on are a historical fact. They may have been factually in some instances also as histrionic as the film represents. I'm quite willing to believe too that the histrionics were as much or more on the side of Chertkov and the Tolstoyans as on Countess Tolstoy's. Still the portrayal of Chertkov as villain was so melodramatic that it's not an exaggeration to say that we see him twirling his mustache.

They may have been factually in some instances also as histrionic as the film represents. I'm quite willing to believe too that the histrionics were as much or more on the side of Chertkov and the Tolstoyans as on Countess Tolstoy's. Still the portrayal of Chertkov as villain was so melodramatic that it's not an exaggeration to say that we see him twirling his mustache. Tolstoy was many things but one of them was was the master of the realistic detail. Sorry none here.";

Or why he wanted to give all his money to the poor. Or why he was so desperate to renounce sex. Or how any of this connected to what was actually happening in Russia at the time.The movie spends hours and hours tittering and giggling over Tolstoy's earthy appetites  as though it's so extraordinary that older people still enjoy having sex. But we don't get even five minutes of time with the people Tolstoy wants to help  the Russian peasants. If we can't see them suffering then Tolstoy's ideas just seem like charming whimsicality. Which is just what this movie wants  to keep things shallow so we can celebrate the joys of casual sex and the gossip and glamor surrounding celebrity couples and not get all hung up on heavy things like poverty justice and human suffering.One moment sums up the whole problem. Early in the movie Tolstoy and his wife actually have a rather interesting conversation about the people. Tolstoy says that if they give all their wealth to the peasants the peasants will embrace them as family and they'll all live peacefully in a world without hunger or injustice. Countess Sophy replies tartly that if the peasants ever got their hands on that much money they'd just spend it on whores and drink.Neither of them brings up a third possibility  that the peasants HATE them and do not WANT to live in brotherhood. The truth the movie ignores is that sooner or later the peasants will make the beautiful people pay for three hundred years of stealing their food women and land. The laziness corruption greed and callousness of the Russian aristocracy  which the real Count Leo Tolstoy knew only too well  is entirely absent from this film.As a result we entirely miss the real tragedy of a flawed but courageous nobleman trying too late to make amends. Instead we get melodrama sentimentality and a lot of schoolgirl giggling about sex.It's like reading PEOPLE magazine instead of War and Peace.".

James MacAvoy plays a young man who scores the job of being Tostoy's assistant and becomes witness to this domestic drama and an unwitting accomplice to the machinations of Tolstoy's close friend and business adviser Paul Giamatti to wrest copyright of Tolstoy's works away from his wife upon the writer's death. If all of this sounds like a delicious set up for great acting and suspenseful intrigue you'd be right unfortunately the movie is so much less than what it could have been.Plummer and Mirren are wonderful in their roles and the movie's best scenes are the ones of them together. However they're not in the movie enough and their relationship which is the most interesting thing about the story takes a back seat to the politics of the Tolstoy movement and MacAvoy's reactions to them. MacAvoy is a terrific actor and I've liked him in everything I've seen him in including this. But I simply didn't care as much about his character as I did Tolstoy and his wife and I spent the whole film itching for the screenplay to give Plummer and Mirren two great British actors more to do.Paul Giamatti's character is oily and unlikable indeed there's something about Giamatti the actor that I find unlikable in general and actually makes it hard for me to watch him. Kerry Condon on the other hand in a smaller role as MacAvoy's love interest is lovely.Grade B".

It calls upon the privileged to devote themselves to vegetarianism pacifism and helping the poor. Tolstoy's ideas about nonviolent resistance were later to have a strong influence on Gandhi and Martin Luther King. At this point communities in Russia have been set up to practice his principles and we glimpse one though Tolstoy himself lives at one remove from it on his big estate eightysomething longbearded still riding horses writing and arguing often affectionately with his wife. Given to fits of generosity that have long infuriated her he's now planning to turn over the rights to his literary works War and Peace Anna Karenina and the rest to the Russian people. This means royalties won't go to his heirs. Sofya Helen Mirren his passionate and outspoken wife of 48 years is vehemently opposed to this which she sees as an abandonment of the rights and needs of Tolstoy's own family. She was supposed to be the literary executor. Her chief opponent on this issue aside from Tolstoy himself is his archsupporter and secretary Vladimir Chertkov Paul Giamatti Chertkov's vying with Sofya for control of the rights.And vying is hardly the word hyperventilating might be more appropriate. Mirren shouts. Plummer growls. Giamatti barks. The Last Station is a heavybreathing historical weepie. It's a RussoGerman production in which everything happens and nothing happens and everybody speaks English. More British than Russian despite its authenticlooking costumes and sets this is one of those posh Masterpiece Theaterstyle productions that draws you in but never feels quite convincing. It's a feast of overacting tumult and peasant clothing made to order for older members of the middleclass art house audience. It's hard to see who's the greatest drama queen here though Mirren who's played a remarkable array of great women in her time including the wife of Caligula a gangland kingpin's moll and  in more restrained mode  a very undrama queen Queen of England probably earns the scenerychewing prize she lets out all the stops. The yelling hissing ranting and sobbing never stop. Sometimes as they send out great puffs of black smoke and chug noisily into remote Russian outposts including Astapovo station where the writer lives his last days even the antique railway trains seem to be overacting.As a wideeyed and innocent new secretary named Valentin sent by Chertkov to spy on the family the young Scottish actor James McAvoy blushes grins tears up and sneezes  nervous reactions because he's so happy and awed to be in the presence of the great man the cutesyness of this is cloying. The cast also includes McAvoy's reallife wife AnneMarie Duff as Sasha Tolstoy's daughter. But Valentin isn't involved with Sasha he connects with a feisty young member of the household at Tolstoy's country estate called Masha Kerry Condon. Masha agrees with the idealistic ethical principles of the group but thinks everyone's a pompous bore. Tolstoy seems to be against sex but Valentin breaks the rules with Masha. McAvoy chews up the scenery in his own way. His character's rather saccharine purity contrasts with the overbearing power struggle and ideological posturing but never really becomes clearly relevant to the main drama. Maybe he's meant to draw in a younger audience for the movie but the effort is feeble.Much is made of separations and reunions. Masha leaves the estate putting Valentin in a quandary. He's too wound up in the Tolstoy family drama to go and join her but it's his loss. Tolstoy is bent on ending his days like a monk and goes off leaving Sofya behind to abandon everything in a remote area but he never makes it beyond the train station at Astapovo where he falls ill. Sofya comes is sent away comes back. It all ends in a funeral scene full of Russian peasant faces recruited actually in Germany where the film was mostly shot a sequence Eisenstein would have done much better. This story is an example of the irony of the rich and famous posing as simple souls. Tolstoy thinks himself alone in his last days but there are hundreds of journalists and photographers outside and the notetaking every time he opens his mouth never ceases.Christopher Plummer who really is 80 is a real acting lion. He's grand in his long gray beard and looks quite like the real Tolstoy. But what he's doing is hamming it up. Giamatti a good journeyman whose best roles are still the lovable losers he played in American Splendor and Sideways looks a lot like the real Chertkov and if we're just not meant to like him he's done enough. Mirren is a great actress but here she's just shrill. Plummer's and Mirren's foreplay scene in which they cavort in bed and cockadoodledo and giggle is about as embarrassing as discreet art house cinema can get. Working from a recent historical novel by Jay Parini Michael Hoffman has not exercised sufficient restraint over his cast in this misguided effort. The actors are at their most but not at their best. And worse yet it's never clear what we're supposed to make of these people and whether Tolstoy's last days were futile tragic or just highly publicized.".

Sofya comes is sent away comes back. It all ends in a funeral scene full of Russian peasant faces recruited actually in Germany where the film was mostly shot a sequence Eisenstein would have done much better. This story is an example of the irony of the rich and famous posing as simple souls. Tolstoy thinks himself alone in his last days but there are hundreds of journalists and photographers outside and the notetaking every time he opens his mouth never ceases.Christopher Plummer who really is 80 is a real acting lion. He's grand in his long gray beard and looks quite like the real Tolstoy. But what he's doing is hamming it up. Giamatti a good journeyman whose best roles are still the lovable losers he played in American Splendor and Sideways looks a lot like the real Chertkov and if we're just not meant to like him he's done enough. Mirren is a great actress but here she's just shrill. Plummer's and Mirren's foreplay scene in which they cavort in bed and cockadoodledo and giggle is about as embarrassing as discreet art house cinema can get. Working from a recent historical novel by Jay Parini Michael Hoffman has not exercised sufficient restraint over his cast in this misguided effort. The actors are at their most but not at their best. And worse yet it's never clear what we're supposed to make of these people and whether Tolstoy's last days were futile tragic or just highly publicized.";

While the acting was OK there was no dramatic tension in the film and seemingly no purpose for making the movie. As other reviewers have noted there was no attempt to show Tolstoy the author the visionary the great old man of Russia. It was simply a soap opera with Helen Mirren shrieking every so often and Plummer mouthing some nonsense. No depth at all. It put me to sleep five or six times. I think the director saw the newsreel and fashioned the film in that vein without any understanding of the author or the events of that time. A real disaster.".

Tolstoy Christopher Plummer lives with his family in a compound at Yasnaya Polyana taking walks and writing and being seen to by his wife and the adherents to his movement people dedicated to his ideas of pacifism vegetarianism sexual abstinence and communal property who have gathered in a forest camp not far away. His wife Sophia Helen Mirren wars openly with the head of his movement Chertkov Paul Giamatti who she claims in his efforts to convince Tolstoy to sign the rights to his works over to the Russian people is trying to steal the wealth that is owed to her upon her husbands imminent death. Observing all of this is Tolstoy's new steward Bulgakov James McAvoy a naive adherent who is torn between his love of the man and concern for his wife.Hoffman's script which is based on the novel by Jay Parini quite often veers itself into confused territory building up a complex tangle of threads and opaque motivations that ultimately don't resolve themselves in any satisfying way. The scope of the film is grand and its story should reverberate just as Tolstoy whose beliefs foreshadowed in some ways both the Bolsheviks' and those of pacifists like Ghandi. It unfortunately doesn't it's ununpickable building up with much gusto confrontations that are constantly ravelling off into nothingness. The threeway relationship between the Church the faithful Sophia and the unbelieving Tolstoy for example is referenced often. In the last section of the film a mute priest in a magnificent hat even shows up but the script never expands on this beyond awkwardly inserting it into the story as an attempt at enriching it or providing some semblance of historical accuracy. There are a ton of details in the film but not enough attention is paid to most of them and as a result the film feels cluttered overburdened energetic but unfortunately pointless.At its heart is the love story between Sophia and Tolstoy and that story as baffling and cramped as it is is the reason to watch the film. Mirren and Plummer are unsurprisingly the best things in the film. Plummer's Tolstoy is vague at once confused and resolute apprehensive and full of joy and certainty. Mirren's Sophia is in full panic in a righteous lather forced to watch and expected to be mute as her husband gives away his time his possessions and his money to people who are unquestionably devoted to him but also clearly in possession of their own agendas. They're great performances all the more so given the vast gulf between the real importance of the couple's place in history and the script's ability to support that both Sophia and Tolstoy seem willed into the film by Mirren and Plummer alone both making the best they can out of what meagre material is there. Giammati and McAvoy both talented actors are unable to do the same and Giamatti's Chertkov seems neither a revolutionary nor a thief and not both at once either but rather a cipher a standin for a whole package of unresolved anxieties and aborted historical impulses. The scope of this thing never boils down to anything it hitches along getting by on the strength of Plummer and Mirren and not much else. It's interesting and pretty but ultimately unrewarding. 4.510".

	schema:headline " The Idealism and Realism of Leo Tolstoy";
	schema:reviewBody "So much has been written about the evolvement of the movement toward social equality the grew out of the second half of the 19th century Russia that we often forget the gentler side of the true meaning of 'socialism' unfortunately it is inexorably tied to the now negative noun 'communism' and has colored the world view of the 20th century losing sight of the original dreams of those who championed the beginnings of it. THE LAST STATION takes us to that time when the kinder aspects of of the movement reigned. Celebrated writer and essayist Leo Tolstoy was deeply admired by the Russian people not only for his immense gifts as a writer but also for his humanitarian concerns that created a solid movement at the end of his career. Could a Count man of wealth and royalty forsake his worldly possessions including the rights to the royalties of his books and spread his belongings to the people of Russia? If the answer were requested from his Countess wife Sofya the answer would be an emphatic NO! this headstrong woman refused to consider letting her rights to her husband's writings which she helped create evaporate into the hands of the 'ignorant poor masses' upon her husband's death. This conflict forms the meat of the story related by THE LAST STATION. WriterDirector Michael Hoffman beautifully adapted the novel by Jay Parini and selected a perfect cast to recreate this important period of time around the final days of Tolstoy's life. Christopher Plummer is able to give us a fully realized portrait of the conflicted Tolstoy. Paul Giamatti seethes oily evil as Tolstoy's principal disciple Chertkov a man so driven to make Tolstoy's life's work into public domain that he alienates almost everyone he encounters. Helen Mirren reveals all the love and passion and fury and rage as Sofya in a performance so richly detailed it must be seen several times to appreciate all the nuances.

	onyx:emotionText "So much has been written about the evolvement of the movement toward social equality the grew out of the second half of the 19th century Russia that we often forget the gentler side of the true meaning of 'socialism' unfortunately it is inexorably tied to the now negative noun 'communism' and has colored the world view of the 20th century losing sight of the original dreams of those who championed the beginnings of it. THE LAST STATION takes us to that time when the kinder aspects of of the movement reigned. Celebrated writer and essayist Leo Tolstoy was deeply admired by the Russian people not only for his immense gifts as a writer but also for his humanitarian concerns that created a solid movement at the end of his career. Could a Count man of wealth and royalty forsake his worldly possessions including the rights to the royalties of his books and spread his belongings to the people of Russia? If the answer were requested from his Countess wife Sofya the answer would be an emphatic NO! this headstrong woman refused to consider letting her rights to her husband's writings which she helped create evaporate into the hands of the 'ignorant poor masses' upon her husband's death. This conflict forms the meat of the story related by THE LAST STATION. WriterDirector Michael Hoffman beautifully adapted the novel by Jay Parini and selected a perfect cast to recreate this important period of time around the final days of Tolstoy's life. Christopher Plummer is able to give us a fully realized portrait of the conflicted Tolstoy. Paul Giamatti seethes oily evil as Tolstoy's principal disciple Chertkov a man so driven to make Tolstoy's life's work into public domain that he alienates almost everyone he encounters. Helen Mirren reveals all the love and passion and fury and rage as Sofya in a performance so richly detailed it must be seen several times to appreciate all the nuances. James McAvoy is the central figure of the story  the appointed secretary Valentin who is sent to Tolstoy's magnificent home to record all of the events developing in the Tolstoyian movement a movement that included living in a commune where Valentin encounter's Masha Kerry Condon who helps him shed his outer shell of protective innocence to discover the true heart of Tolstoy's movement  Love!

	schema:reviewBody "The American director Michael Hoffman in adapting Jay Prini's semifactual novel about the last year in the life of the great 19th century Russian writer Leo Tolstoy makes as his central character not the famous author but his wet behind the ears 23 year old secretary Valentin who is hired by Count Tolstoy's devout admirer Vladimir Chertkoff to both work for Tolstoy and spy on the countess Sofya. She is not sympathetic to her aging husband's anarchoChristian leanings nor to the movement based on his philosophy and fears the family will be deprived of the benefit of Tolstoy's copyrights.Valentin played fetchingly by James McAvoy is a bewildered witness to the crisis in the stormy relationship between Tolstoy and his wife which results in Tolstoy fleeing Sofya and his estate only to die at a lonely railway station many miles away with the world's media such as it was in 1910 looking on. Unfortunately Valentin based on a real person is not only green but rather ineffectual and he is in the story as a witness rather than as an actor. One of the features of Tolstoyans was that they all seemed to have kept diaries and these provided Parini with most of his material. You can see why Hoffman made Valentin the central character but his ineptitude is rather tiresome and his seduction by the lovely Tolstoyan Masha Kerry Condon in contradiction to Tolstoyanmandated chastity is all a bit beside the point. It is the relationship between Leo Lev and Sofya that provides the real drama here and the final scenes between them are genuinely moving.Helen Mirren as the histrionic Sofya is alone worth the price of admission and Christopher Plummer as Tolstoy is convincing though he demonstrates a lot more personal warmth than the real Tolstoy apparently did. Despite most of the filming being done in Germany the Russian atmosphere and countryside were wellevoked though I did wonder whether the serfs were real  none of them seemed to speak. There were also some inconsistencies in the screenplay  in one scene Valentin is at the Tolstoyan commune two hours from Tolstoy's estate at Yasnaya Polyana yet in a later scene he rides between the two places seemingly in a few minutes.Apart from the love story and Tolstoy did maintain that love was all that really mattered the other theme is the contrast between high ideals and the personal power play evident in the movement. The Chertkoff character slyly played by Paul Giamatti is a Machiavellian schemer unlike his reallife model and even if Sofya had been more levelheaded she had something to fear. But in the end the politics peter out and what remains is the rather sad end of a great literary figure feeding a media frenzy. Tolstoy was not actually Mother Teresa or Mahatma Gandhi with whom he corresponded but he deserved a more dignified death  he valued peace not war.".

	schema:reviewBody "Based on the book by Vito Russo written by Armistead Maupin and narrated by Lily Tomlin THE CELLULOID CLOSET uses interviews and hundreds of film clips to examine the way in which Hollywood has presented gay and lesbian characters on film from the age of silent cinema to such recent films as PHILADELPHIA and DESERT HEARTS. Throughout the documentary the focus is on both stereotypes and the various ways that more creative directors and writers worked around the censorship of various decades to create implicitly homosexual characters with considerable attention given to the way in which stereotypes shaped public concepts of the gay community in general. Overtly homosexual characters were not particularly unusual in silent and precode Hollywood films and CLOSET offers an interesting sampling of both swishy stereotypes and unexpectedly sophisticated charactersboth of which were doomed by the Hayes Code a series of censorship rules adopted by Hollywood in the early 1930s.The effect of the Code was to soften some of the more grotesque stereotypesbut more interesting was the impetus the Code gave to film makers to create homosexual characters and plot lines that would go over the heads of industry censors but which could still be interpreted by astute audiences with films such as THE MALTESE FALCON REBECCA BENHUR and REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE cases in point. Once the Code collapsed however Hollywood again returned to stereotypes in an effort to cash in on controversywith the result that throughout most of the sixties and seventies homosexual characters were usually presented as unhappy maladjusted creatures at best suicidal and psychopathic entities at worst.The film clips are fascinating stuff and are often highlighted by interviews of individuals who made the films Tony Curtis re SOME LIKE IT HOT and SPARTACUS Shirley MacLaine re THE CHILDREN'S HOUR Stephen Boyd re BENHUR Farley Granger re ROPE and Whoopie Goldberg re THE COLOR PURPLE to name but a few. All are interesting and intriguing but two deserve special mention Harvey Fierstein who talks about the hunger he had as a youth to see accurate reflections of himself on the screen and Susan Sarandon who makes an eloquent statement on the power of film as the keeper of the dreams.Although the material will have special appeal to gays and lesbians it should be of interest to any serious film buff with its mix of trivia and significant fact. The DVD also includes notable packages of outtakes from interviews that are often as interesting as the material that made the final cut. If the documentary has a fault however it is that it offers no summing up preferring instead to show only how far the portrayal of homosexuals has come and indicating how far it has yet to go. Recommended to any one interested in film history and interpretation.Gary F. Taylor aka GFT Amazon Reviewer".

	schema:headline " Everyone should see this film.....every film lover especially so every gay person definitely!";
	schema:reviewBody "This is not a film in the traditional sense...perhapsThis is not a documentary in the traditional sense...probablyWhat is it??The Celluloid Closet is a comprehensive history of film  gay film straight film is sheisn't she?... film. Everything. It is the result of 10 years hard work  noone especially big filmtv studios is keen to fund a 2 hour film on gay movie visibility they're all too busy closetted away often literally making sure viewers won't be offended by their output...However the time effort and sheer love that has gone into this is utterly evident and it may be a blessing in disguise that it took so very long. The film is based heavily on the late Vitto Russo's book of the same name. Russo was a film buff who catalogued in detail the visibility of gay and lesbian characters in cinema. He included film from across the globe and updated the book for the last time in the mid eighties Parting Glances and My Beautiful Launderette having just been completed before the explosion of new gay film of the last decade. The film takes the historical content of the book and uses the best editing I have ever seen to produce enlightening sequences on the treatment of gay people and issues. Although it only concentrates on Hollywood films it has the advantage over the book in that it was right up to date at its time of completion.Not only does The Celluloid Closet use selfappointed gay films it also takes enormous pleasure in covering those films we love and know as gay classics even though the tension is a subtle subplot often totally lost on a straight audience! Absolute treats are the celebrity comments they will set a thousand conspiracy theories going in your head too! better still is the input of relatively unknown behindthecamera people writers etc who are at liberty to be far more honest about their views.There are also clips from classics like Rebecca Calamity Jane the dykiest show on earth if you ask me! Ben Hur My Beautiful Launderette Parting Glances.......etc etc.. Any film you can think of is probably there  if not then maybe you should write a sequel!Did you ever think that Laurel and Hardy were very cosy with each other? Did you think Mrs Danvers was a little forward going through Rebecca's undies? Did  you explode at that kiss in Morroco? Have you always secretly thought The Hunger was a good movie? .............Well so did someone else.

I'd go as far as saying it's perfect film.It has no charactersplot etc  but it shows the progress of gay visibility as one of the best stories there is. The people who made those movies are the cast. It is a filmIt is informtive funny clever and revealing. It tells EVERYONE about their history and heritage. The general  observations about filmwatching apply to anyone. It's impressively detached and lets you draw your own interpretation. It's a documentary.You will sit there thinking wow when it finishs. You will wonder how you view films  and how everyone else views them. It may even make you nostalgic for the days when closetted was the only option and endless sexscenes were impossible and forbidden so plot and dialogoue had to make do. You will think of omissions and ponder those included but it will get you thinking. That's the important part.If this film doesn't make you want to go out and watch all your favourite movies plus all those featured in it then I'll be amazed!It may sound like it but it's no chore to watch. It's a pleasure.It's inspiring. wonderful. Ultimately uplifting. And you'll need to see it again.....and again....and again! ....oh yes! And kd lang sings Secret Love at the end! Wow!...".

	onyx:emotionText "This is not a film in the traditional sense...perhapsThis is not a documentary in the traditional sense...probablyWhat is it??The Celluloid Closet is a comprehensive history of film  gay film straight film is sheisn't she?... film. Everything. It is the result of 10 years hard work  noone especially big filmtv studios is keen to fund a 2 hour film on gay movie visibility they're all too busy closetted away often literally making sure viewers won't be offended by their output...However the time effort and sheer love that has gone into this is utterly evident and it may be a blessing in disguise that it took so very long. The film is based heavily on the late Vitto Russo's book of the same name. Russo was a film buff who catalogued in detail the visibility of gay and lesbian characters in cinema. He included film from across the globe and updated the book for the last time in the mid eighties Parting Glances and My Beautiful Launderette having just been completed before the explosion of new gay film of the last decade. The film takes the historical content of the book and uses the best editing I have ever seen to produce enlightening sequences on the treatment of gay people and issues. Although it only concentrates on Hollywood films it has the advantage over the book in that it was right up to date at its time of completion.Not only does The Celluloid Closet use selfappointed gay films it also takes enormous pleasure in covering those films we love and know as gay classics even though the tension is a subtle subplot often totally lost on a straight audience! Absolute treats are the celebrity comments they will set a thousand conspiracy theories going in your head too! better still is the input of relatively unknown behindthecamera people writers etc who are at liberty to be far more honest about their views.There are also clips from classics like Rebecca Calamity Jane the dykiest show on earth if you ask me! Ben Hur My Beautiful Launderette Parting Glances.......etc etc.. Any film you can think of is probably there  if not then maybe you should write a sequel!Did you ever think that Laurel and Hardy were very cosy with each other? Did you think Mrs Danvers was a little forward going through Rebecca's undies? Did  you explode at that kiss in Morroco? Have you always secretly thought The Hunger was a good movie? .............Well so did someone else. Quite a lot of someone elses  and some of them were the writers!This is such a good film for too many reasons.

There's a brilliant injoke clip from Red River where Montgomery Clift is told about the beauty of a Swiss watch and a woman  and then asked if he's ever had a Swiss watch. The film looks at gay stereotypes such as the pansy or the sissy the characters that Franklin Pangborn used to play. Some of the interviewees are exceptional namely Harvey Fierstein Gore Vidal and the incredible Quentin Crisp. Vidal gives a hilarious recount of including a gay backstory in Ben Hur which Charlton Heston of course denies.The film is also touching and kind of heartbreaking. You realize that in the century we've had movies how enormously they've shaped our culture and our perception of people and how if the filmmakers and studio heads hadn't been pressured by the horrible Hayes code society's collective view of gays might not be so troublesome. There's a great moment where Quentin Crisp talks about census takers in England asking about homosexuality. They were asked whether they knew any homosexuals. If the answer was yes they were asked what they were like to which they replied just like everybody else. If they answered no they were asked what they would expect to meet to which they replied someone with grand gestures and flamboyance and bright colors. So that there are two images we have in our minds  one of what homosexuals are like and one of what homosexuals should be like. And movies played a huge role in that. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "The Celluloid Closet is a fascinating wellinformed vastly entertaining heavily emotional and infuriating documentary. It reminds us how aware we already were before watching it and makes us even more aware upon watching it that America has always been full of blind hate for things it hardly knows of when those things may be innate parts of someone both hoping and scared to be noticed and nonetheless only wanting acceptance. The Celluloid Closet one of the most important documentaries I have ever seen makes it clear that in over 100 years of movies homosexuality has only been depicted on the screen every here and there and almost always as something to laugh at or pity or fear thus hate. These images have always been momentary or subtle and passing but they have left a deep imprint on America and so the world. Lily Tomlin narrates Hollywood taught straight people what to think about gay people and gay people what to think about themselves. No one escaped its influence.Also when you watch this film you may hopefully slowly slip out of that defensive shell we as a culture have a denial that movies affect us or that any of that depends on age. This film proves beyond the shadow of a doubt how the subtlest alterations to a film and the slightest shades of attitudes can leave lasting conscious or subconscious imprints on us.The film takes us through the thrillingly interesting period of the 1950s when screenwriters and directors acted almost as undercover operatives when slipping in the slightest ambiguous homosexual or bisexual undertones the most shocking of which was BenHur and the staggeringly angering 1960s but maybe the focal point of the movie's conclusion is that at the very beginning starting with Thomas Edison's experimental film of two men dancing together and continuing sparingly through the silent era and shortly after was a time when men were free to express tenderness with each other on the screen but as the world grew more aware of homosexuality affection between males would be seen as a completely unacceptable shunworthy act. Two guy friends can rarely even hold each other in a movie! However there has always been a difference in how audiences look at two men being affectionate or sexual and two women being sexual. There's a comfort with female nudity and affectionate bonding that can be not only acceptable but considered sexy by the general public. Women somehow don't find it threatening the way it is with men and men find it either completely nonthreatening or arousing or both. Movies like The Color Purple Personal Best and Thelma  Louise showcase things between two women that are still highly taboo between two men. Even hit movies like Philadelphia and Brokeback Mountain which actually is not mentioned in this film only because this was released about a decade before it are no true steps forward for homosexuality in cinema because they are about the sadness and alienation of being gay and on a very obscure note in case someone hasn't seen one or either they end with death.It remains to be seen whether or not Hollywood and American audiences will embrace a movie with a gay hero who lives and can be integrated with other people. They are the only minority who has yet to be given solid recognition and voice in the most universal and popular form of entertainment and communication in our culture.".

The strength of the film is a huge number of clips from a vast range of films which show that after a fairly liberal early period homophobia reigned supreme until the late 1960s and still can be seen in mainstream movies today. One of the great gay clichs is the homosexual movie buff in love with the likes of Judy Garland so it is ironic that so many gay people should turn to the Hollywood product for distraction given how antigay that product was. Some of the industry people interviewed for the film boast of how the censors were outsmarted on occasion for example Gore Vidal's account of how Charlton Heston was fooled into acting gay in Ben Hur but it was not until Boys in the Band the film of a successful stage play in 1970 that homosexuality broke through as a topic for candid treatment.With Brokeback Mountain in line for an Academy Award or two this year gay themes can clearly now be mainstream. This film reminds us that cinema reflects the society from which it springs and the United States has not historically been tolerant to what we might call sexual minorities. Somehow things loosened up in the 1960s and filmmakers followed the trend though not the lawmakers in most states. The genie is now out of the box gay rights are reasonably well established and there is no going back. It will be interesting to see how American gay cinema retains its edge now that homosexuality has become domesticated.".

	schema:reviewBody "Celluloid Closet is in fact a political documentary. That's the saddest part about this movie because what it uncovers is a systematic history of scapegoating in early Hollywood filmmaking. Americans overall a generous and tolerant people have been taught for over a century to despise and fear queers and queer relationships. This movie is about the part of that campaign that was conducted in American film.But CC isn't just a sad movie. As we see toward the end of the film the attitude of Hollywood has shifted in recent years. People are slowly seeing past the hatred they've been carefully taught seeing that queers are ... just people people who love each other. People who love each other so much that they courageously hold onto that love despite generations of oppression from nearly all quarters of American society official and unofficial.Ultimately despite the contemporary kneejerk backlash the wishes of GLBTQ people to enjoy rights taken for granted by all other American citizens will be granted.

	onyx:emotionText "Celluloid Closet is in fact a political documentary. That's the saddest part about this movie because what it uncovers is a systematic history of scapegoating in early Hollywood filmmaking. Americans overall a generous and tolerant people have been taught for over a century to despise and fear queers and queer relationships. This movie is about the part of that campaign that was conducted in American film.But CC isn't just a sad movie. As we see toward the end of the film the attitude of Hollywood has shifted in recent years. People are slowly seeing past the hatred they've been carefully taught seeing that queers are ... just people people who love each other. People who love each other so much that they courageously hold onto that love despite generations of oppression from nearly all quarters of American society official and unofficial.Ultimately despite the contemporary kneejerk backlash the wishes of GLBTQ people to enjoy rights taken for granted by all other American citizens will be granted. Americans will come to regret as with Indians and Blacks their record of hatred directed against people they have refused to understand. Understanding comes with knowledge and Celluloid Closet is a key picture treating its subject with great heart and courage.";

	schema:reviewBody "A history of homosexuality as presented in the cinema. It makes some good points even if some are a little obvious. As an example Lilly Tomlin the narrator points out that female homosexuality seems to be a little less objectionable to the public than male homosexuality  and it's true in my experience. I've always been curious about alternative life styles and spent a good deal of time in and around gay bars in Greenwich Village and San Francisco including the one and only original Black Cat Cafe on Montgomery used the words campy and gay before they entered the mainstream lexicon. And as a cultural anthropologist I went through the workshop on Human Sexuality Training at UC Berkeley. I don't really care one way or another about a friend's gender orientation. Yet I still wince a bit when I see men kissing on screen while I find lesbian love scenes can be a turn on. The movie offers no explanation for this common experience  nor can it since no one has figured it out as far as I know. I'll skip some technical guesses here. Oh a note. I haven't read the book this film is based on but anybody who wants to explore the dynamics of a gay community should check out Frances Fitzgerald's Cities on a Hill. The movie pulls a lot of information together and makes a convincing case for its chief argument which is that gay people have been unfairly treated on the screen. In early movies they were mainly lisping and limpwristed stereotypes good mainly for laughs. Think of prissy Franklin Pangborn or Edward Everet Horton. I guess it must seem demeaning to gay people but it really IS funny to see a person assume a different identity and use a bit of overkill. It's always amusing to see Robin Williams act gay or do his Yiddish schtick on TV. The humor in mixed identities goes back at least to Greek comedy. To explain why it's funny you'd have to have a philosophy of jokes and humor and a better one than Freud's.In a second filmic developmental stage both male and female gays became villains. Again the movie offers no explanation for the change although again maybe none is possible. And modern movies STILL turn many heavies into homosexuals  even a liberal fave like Z for instance. Or Gene Hackman's aide in No Way Out or Hitchcock's North by Northwest. I can't see any particular reason for this overlay of evil. It may be amusing to act out an identity different from the one with which you were biologically endowed but it isn't naturally enraging to hand the same problem over to a villain. Not that there aren't evil gay people just that there's no reason to think that there are more evil gay people than evil straight people so why are they disproportionately represented on screen? I think I can take a simple guess at this answer. A lot of middle Americans hate queers. I would guess that if you were going to come out it would be a lot safer to do it in a blue state than in a red state.The narration keeps us up with the clips we're seeing on screen but carries an accusatory tone  YOU did it you Fascist. I don't especially like it because frankly I didn't do a thing and neither did anyone else I know. Actually I think homosexuality may be Mother Nature's way of damping population explosions. It increases among crowded mice. The most penetrating remarks and the only funny ones come from the talking heads who have been in one way or another affiliated with movies about gays. Some of these interviewees are really witty and direct. Susan Sarandon points out that lesbians embrace affectionately and sometimes kiss at the end of the film while male buddies run off bravely to die together as in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid in which they get their guns out because they can't get their ds out. There's a lot more to be said on the subject and on this film but let us observe the limitations on space. The movie ends on a somewhat upbeat note. Hollywood is now beginning to deal with homosexuality in a mature way. The Boys in the Band is given as an instance. But the movie was released in 1996 and doesn't bring up a newer trend that may be emerging. If gays were stereotypical jokes in early movies and villains in later ones they may now be turning into sidekicks on the screen or into supporting people who turn the movie into something hip. Vide Copycat VictorVictoria Internal Affairs Single White Female and a slew of others. It's probably their most encouraging cinematic function yet showing us that homosexuality needn't be an earthshattering mental disease at all.".

Obvious representations include the sissy gay man and the bitchy lesbian but other portrayals have made them look unstable.Particularly interesting is how during the years of the Hays Code part of which forbade portrayals of sexual perversions in movies directors often sneaked in references to homosexuality in movies such as BenHur.

If you are looking for this like I am then this film ain't it.My final complaint is something you can't blame on this documentary. Because the film was made in 1995 many of the complaints about not having enough gay images in film seems rather out of date as gay characters abound not only in film but seem to abound on television. The complaint I have is that although the many gays about on television because they are incredibly clichdusually being noble to the point of nausea in some instances or campy and clever like the Queer Eye folks. While not politically correct showing gays who are jerks country folk NOT like you'd see in DELIVERANCE average folks Mexicans baseball players pizza delivery guys or even idiots would be a nice change of paceat least this would make them more three dimensional.".

It seems at first to work but the cost is great.The format is simple some talking heads or in the case of Spike a talky story that somehow tells us what is right then a collection of examples with annotative explanations that matchshow that truth.The problem is the relationship that film has to the world. Powerful film invents the world and in doing so taps into inner recesses of our imaginations and slides a few things about in there. We are unaware of how this sort of visual reasoning works on us and that is precisely WHY it works. Logic never enters the picture. It cannot especially political logic and that's why this project is a mess and probably does more harm than good.Naturally I'm for improved social justice all around and particularly in this area. And I agree with the filmmakers that film images can do incredible long term unforeseeable damage in society. And my comments here do not pertain to omissions in the project or flaws in the political stance.But consider the problem film is artistic not pedantic. That's where its power comes from. The more polemic you get  the more preachy  the less power over us any film has. Any number of examples can be given say Cuckoo's Nest' or even the lesser Rain Man' as compared to I Am Sam' or The Other Sister.' The more we try the less effect we can have. Imparting greater awareness of whatever problem may occur. But in this case all the power comes from snippets of the original films themselves. No talking head here gives us anything remotely powerful in their stead except recourse to a Jiminy Cricket' pretty thin stuff. And it is a step back because with this new awareness of the problem we can feel better without having had any effect.In other words the situation is that film generally has a relationship to the real world.

The third layer is what affects the first. The second is only a channel. Documentaries like this add a fourth layer film about film.

	schema:headline " The great controversy on sexuality in Hollywood";
	schema:reviewBody "The Celluloid Closet is a documentary that focuses on the evolution of sexuality in a multitude of Hollywood films and movies from the early 1900's to the early 1990's. The directors Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman portrays the views of homosexuality through a series of clips from numerous films and interviews of early actors directors and screenwriters. Throughout this documentary the interviewees reveal how society reacted from the beginning of the queer films and up until modern times. This documentary is heavily based on book The Celluloid Closet written by Vitto Russo. There are no main characters throughout this film but rather focuses on the comments of each of the interviewees on the incredible growth of LGBTQ films and its effect on society. Many simply think of watching movies for entertainment purposes. However movies have a greater influence on everyone's life than one may think whether he or she is straight gay or lesbian. Actors and screenwriters described the impact of movies during their early childhood and how people mainly went to see movies to see if the movies could relate to themselves. In early American society homosexuality was viewed as humorous. The documentary then continues to describe the slander on queer films by the Catholic Church and its role in the portraying of LGBTQ content thus leading to complications and censorship. Homosexuality was then viewed in the roles of numerous cold blooded villains such as Dracula's Daughter and was shown in desperate gay characters that were unhappy and suicidal. Moreover homophobia was seen as a disease in the 1950's and many people resented homosexuals. Finally Hollywood presented homosexuality in a positive manner shedding a new light in American culture. Overall The Celluloid Closet is an interesting documentary portraying the incredible evolution of queer films in Hollywood. Even though the content is portrayed in movies and films its effect on society was greater than one may have thought. It is informative interesting and funny. It is incredible on how society during the early 1900's portrays queer films being risky impossible and forbidden yet exciting and daring. Therefore this documentary is highly recommended to movies fans who are interested in the making of queer films.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Celluloid Closet was a film that documented the use of homosexual characters in the world of Hollywood. Clips from films with LGBTQ characters actors and writers of those movies and current actors and actresses were all used to help display the history of the progression of homosexual characters in movies. The documentary was shown in chronological order from the 1930s to the early 1990s emphasizing the stereotypical and sometimes unfair to normal ways in which homosexuals were portrayed. The commentary from the actors actresses and actors provided an entertainment and informative factor that kept the audience attentive to the subject of the documentary. It was interesting to see how in the films LGBTQ had transitioned from light hearted humorous characters to stereotypical sissies to villainous individuals suffering from some sort of mental illness. Hollywood has such an effect to the everyday life that many individuals in Presbyterian Church called for a reform on the homosexual exposure in films. The Hays Codes being enforced and the amount of censorship that had to be enforced in movies made directing a film with a homosexual character in it much more difficult. The coded language and subtle movements by the actors portraying the LGBTQ characters made it clear to audiences that there was homosexual exposure in the film just not so obvious. This film is highly recommended for it brings new knowledge of the film world to light in regards to the issue of homosexuality. It also depicts a clear representation of how the values of different eras change drastically throughout time. Because the documentary was made in the early 1990s it would be interesting to see how the commentators view LGBTQ characters in film today.".

	schema:headline " Journey Through Homosexual Film History";
	schema:reviewBody "The Celluloid Closet is a very informative interesting documentary that evaluates the way Hollywood has presented homosexual relationships beginning in the 1930s. From the very beginning when homosexual relationships began to appear in films Hollywood has always had an influence on the audience of what to think about gays as well as how gays should feel about themselves. In early appearances the homosexual hints in films was not discussed publicly after being viewed it was sort of ignored and thought of as comedy. After homosexual scenes became more and more prevalent and common the Catholic and Protestant churches grew very angry starting boycotts of any film that hinted even the smallest bit of homosexuality. Film writers and directors began finding other ways to project homosexuals by making it harder to catch the gay hints or even making the homosexual character a villain in a sense. This homosexual villain character was very common in films until the British film Victim. This particular film was the first to actually use the word homosexual therefore beginning another era of homosexuality in films. Although the homosexual word was not used openly in films gays seemed to perceived as having a mental illness now. In addition audiences were applauding villains killers or the killed if they were homosexual. They seemed to enjoy the homosexual characters' pain while watching these films. Overall The Celluloid Closet takes its audience on the journey through the evolution of homosexuality in Hollywood films. Clearly this film is wonderful in itself as it explores other very famous films throughout history discussing how homosexual scenes were presented in many of them.".

The original SouthSea Islands Film. Excellent.".

Monte Blue in his finest silent performance is a doctor who has become disenchanted with his existence  has taken to the bottle. He meets Sebastian a modern day opportunist cum pirate. He and Monte clash and later Monte is shanghaied by some of Sebastian's thugs and tied to the wheel of a schooner which in the title cards is infested with bubonic plagued dead bodies. The schooner is set adrift in a storm and Monte gets loose from the wheel and tries steering the boat to safety only to end up on some rocks on an uncharted tropical Pacific island. Monte later after the shipwreck meets some native islanders who have been insulated from the outside worldcivilisation. They adopt Monte as one of their own and he learns to live with them and has a renewed interest in life. As time goes on Montehis character is called Lloyd the natives become as family. One day Monte goes pearl diving and realizes the value of such an abundance of pearls. Greed overtakes Monte causing him to throw his newfound existence with the natives as well as their trust in the garbage can. He sets out a signal fire atop a hill to be rescued. The only boat to see his signal is Sebastian  his men. They arrive in all of their colonial like arrogance and get the native women to smoke cigarettes  the men to be lazy. Later Monte  Sebastian meet a final time before one of Sebastian's men shoots Monte dead.This is a fine film to introduce a novice to silent films. It's what these films were all about. Fine story telling without any recorded dialogue. Beautiful travelogue like photographyin Tahiti by the way. A 10 out of 10 from me.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the tale of a doctor who is disgusted at the greed of the White sailors who plunder and exploit the Polynesian natives. Risking their lives to retrieve huge pearls the locals are given mere trinkets. And when a few die the Whites take no heed. But when the doctor has had enough and verbally attacks these businessmen his is tied to the wheel of a ship full of plague victims and cast adrift. Fortunately he finds an unspoiled island full of sweet villagers. Will the wicked White men come and destroy this paradise too or will the doctor find the peace he so craves? The film has amazingly good cinematography and it's nice to see that the crew went to Tahiti to film. Additionally the film is innovative because it's MGM's first sound film though like most of these early films it is NOT allsound but uses some synchronized music and sound effects. At the time audiences were spellboundtoday it just seems like a nice silent film with some added sound and nothing more. The story is very good and compelling though at times a bit too earnest and preachy about those White Devils and their greed.I am a huge fan of F.W. Murnau the great German director. While he did some wonderful and very advanced films such as NOSFERATU FAUST and THE LAST LAUGH somehow the final film in his career TABU 1931 has also been accorded 'classic status'even though it was a silent film made in 1931. In addition you can't help but think that Murnau was copying WHITE SHADOWS IN THE SOUTH SEASas the films seem very similar to me. However WHITE SHADOWS was an innovative film with synchronized sound and music. By 1931 sound was the standard in many nations and Murnau's making a silent seemed a bit out of date. If I had to watch just one of these films I'd pick WHITE SHADOWS.".

Robert Flaherty a famed documentary maker was selected to direct. Thalberg had been very impressed with his Moana of 1926. W.S. Van Dyke was named as assistant director he had mainly worked on westerns but in years to come with films such as Trader Horn 1931 and The Thin Man 1934 etc he earned a reputation as a stylish but fast director who always got films finished on time. Almost immediately Flaherty found the studio schedule too binding and walked out  W.S. Van Dyke carried on. With the involvement of both Flaherty and Van Dyke the movie has the best of both worlds  the magnificent documentary style of photography combined with an imaginative stirring story.Filmed in Tahiti even though the opening credits claim it was shot on location in the Marquesas Islands with authentic islanders it tells the story of white shadows in the South Seas  the shadow white men cast over the beautiful untouched Polynesian Islands. Dr. Matthew Lloyd Monte Blue a derelict of the islands is an alcoholic and despairs of the way white men have cheated robbed and exploited the trusting natives. He makes an enemy of Sebastian Robert Anderson an evil trader who manages to get Lloyd on to a plague ridden boat which during a typhoon is ship wrecked on another uncharted island. Island life is filmed in a golden glow  absolutely dazzling. The scenes of natives diving for pearls preparing the feast and doing ceremonial dances have a documentary feel to them Flaherty's influence and are a glorious panorama of a lost time. When Lloyd rescues the chief's young son from drowning the island people make him a God. Eventually he also succumbs to the instinct of his ruthless race  Greed!! He finds a cast off pearl and starts to dive for them. When Fayaway beautiful Raquel Torres finds him lighting a fire to attract passing ships her sadness and pleading convinces him he has been a fool. More white shadows come with a boatful of traders the evil Sebastian among them who intend to open a store and send the natives diving for pearls. The ending is confronting and not at all like I thought it would be  it creates a very sad and somber finish to a beautiful thoughtful film.Monte Blue had been a rugged leading man throughout the twenties  this was probably his best remembered film. Raquel Torres a beautiful Mexican actress made her debut as Fayaway but unfortunately in the handful of films she made she was usually cast as island girls with names like Raquella Pepita and hula dancer.Highly Highly Recommended.".

Once the traders prevail it's almost painful to see these innocents replaced with dangling cigarettes laboring children and commercialized dancing. Though kept brief the stark contrast took nerve on the part of filmmakers who risked backlash from audiences unused to seeing Western impact in a negative light. For rarely do we see the effects of colonial expansion portrayed in such touching terms. Sure some of the movie's romance scenes are overlong while others are plain hokey. But the underlying theme of paradise lost remains as affecting now as it was then.Not to excuse the ruthless tradersbut when the simple native economy is replaced by the Western commodity economy an historical dilemma is posed. On one hand we regret the loss of the simple idyllic innocence so powerfully portrayed in the trusting people and natural abundance of the tropical isle. However that idyllic existence is also a static existence with no motive for science knowledge or development at least as the Western world understands them. Whatever their greedy motives the traders do represent the possibilities of dynamic Western culture. Put simply and starkly the contrasting choice is between a culture of comfortable inertia or one of developmental challenge. The appeal of each is something to think about. Anyway I'm not sure which I would choose but after a long week's work I think I'm with the doctor.".

Caption cards are still used throughout the film for the dialogue. Was also actually filmed in Tahiti which would have been pretty rare for those times. Monte Blue  plays Doctor Lloyd  and Robert Anderson the trader had been in silent films for years but this was Raquel Torres' Fayaway first role. In our story when pearls are discovered in the waters of the south seas the white men move in to take advantage. The natives are up against the caucasian traders the critters of the sea storms and sickness when it comes to their shores. The story is quite simple but the outdoor and underwater photography are the high points here. Even with a respectable restoration different scenes appear in various colors and the lighting and sound have become slightly spotty. Interesting scenes at the feast where prior to cooking the fish is carefully sewn up in leaves to keep it from burning. Where others have despaired over the documentary feel to the film I felt that this was one of the strengths. Although some of those costumes and dances DO look pretty hokey. Lloyd lives with the natives and must decide what his long term goal is and how to reach it. Several scenes have been sped up which may have been an effort by someone to move the plot along more quickly. Directed by WS Van Dyke produced by Thalberg and Stromberg all pretty big cheeses in the industry at the time.".

	schema:reviewBody "MGM did this film no favour by promoting it as their first sound film. Given the obsession with sound that dominated the US cinema industry in 1928 this meant that all criticism of the film tended to concentrate on whether it ws or was not a genuine sound film  which quite evidently it was not. It has a musical score by William Axt intermingled with a few sound effects but since such orchestral scores were already common in major cinemas during the late silent era only the degree of synchronisation the first work of MGM sound recordist Douglas Shearer represented any kind of innovation.And the value of the film is not of course there at all but lies as with any other good silent film in the strong script and excellent cinematography by Clyde de Vinna who received the Oscar and would work on all Van Dyke's exotic films of the next few years  The Pagan Trader Horn The Eskimo and Bob Roberts who has worked with Flaherty on Moana 1926 and would go on rather surprisingly to become one of the principal cinematographers in the flourishing Argentinian film industry.Normally speaking this film ought to represent everything that I tend to find crass and mediocre in US film. It is a producer's and cutter's film par excellence chosen by Irving Thalberg himself and directed by the notorious oneshot Woody Robert Flaherty who was initially to have directed was sacked for working too slowly.Yet I have to admit this seems to me in some ways the classic US film at its best before the influence of sound has become fully felt. It may not have been shot as it claims in the Marquesas but was nevertheless made on location in Tahiti and the cinematography is not in the least studiobound nor overly preoccupied with continuity or glamorous starfocus. It makes use of local nonprofessional actors and actors and gives a dignified and not altogether paradisal picture of traditional island life. Even without the influence of Flaherty the film is too slow for at least one other commentator that is to say probably just about right for any nonUS audience. To my mind it is not the documentary aspects of the film one would like to see curtailed but rather the tiresome and oversentimental lovescenes to please Thalberg's philistine colleague Stromberg complete with a bit of whistling to assuage the soundbuffs which are quite the weakest feature of the film.Then politically as other reviewers have already remarked it is a strong and unambiguous condemnation of colonial exploitation. In this respect there were two different trends in the US take on traditional cultures  the progressist notion on the one hand that they were picturesque but desperately and cruelly harsh the view favored by Flaherty in Nanook or in The Man of Arran and the nostalgic view of such cultures as paradisial curiously also associated almost by accident with Flaherty who had been unable to find anything sufficiently gruesome on Samoa and had to be satisfied with reviving a defunct practice of painful bodytattooing for his 1926 film Moana. As a result Moana had been sold as an idyll and contributed to the development of a US tiki culture dominated by ideas of the lost paradise and the noble savage.Probably this film like Murnau's later Taboo gained from the departure of Flaherty whose politics were always inclined to favour rather than condemn the civilising mission. Thalberg and Van Dyke have strongly taken the opposite view while not exaggerating the notion of paradise either. In other words they have successfully steered a course between two false myths that of primitives saved by civilisation from the harsh savagery on the one hand and that of a paradisal idyll on the other. Here whether originally paradisal or not we are shown a world that is victim to a genuinely savage exploitation by the dregend of colonialism as in the stories of Joseph Conrad but the contrast shown very clearly in the parallel scenes of diving and in the more heavily allegorical opposition between pearls and fishhooks is not despite a bit of false rhetoric so much between a paradise and a hell but rather quite simply and correctly between a good and bad use of natural resources and between decent and indecent valuesystems. In the later scenes the story turns totally to moral parable the corrupting white shadow that develops in the hero himself but shorn of the more mystical elements of the original book it remains on the whole a reasonably realistic representation excellently played and excellently shot. The ending which I shall not reveal although it is I some ways the most unusual feature of the film is powerful where it could so easily have been facile. The film holds up well  as another reviewer remarks beside Murnau's 1931 Tabu and compares very favourably indeed with King Vidor's 1932 The Bird of Paradise a muddle of all conceivable myths and.a falsely glamorous starvehicle.The same cannot be said for the marketing of the film which was a model of tasteless exploitation with Sid Grauman's prologue to the film at the Chinese Theater The Tropics involving an extravagant array of tiki singing and dancing. All the same that white shadow' past ad the film shown the stars were also present to talk afterwards about their experience in making it.".

But... The ending? Awful terrible and bad! Monte Blue is a drunken doctor who does what he can for the natives who need medical help. He also doesn't like the way his fellow white people exploit the natives. He strikes up a friendship with Raquel and things blossom into love. Earlier in the film he told one of the white exploiters how awful he thought his practices were. Unmoved by this the exploiter suggests he leave and continuing to do what he did would be hazardous to the doctor's health. Toward the end of the film Monte takes up the cause again and the exploiter keeping his word has him shot. He dies and Raquel is shown weeping over his grave in the final scene. Not that bad a film but the ending left me cold!".

	onyx:emotionText "White Shadows of the South Seas has lots of wonderful scenery both the plant and human kind. The women natives and leading lady Raquel Torres are not hard to look at whatsoever. But... The ending? Awful terrible and bad! Monte Blue is a drunken doctor who does what he can for the natives who need medical help. He also doesn't like the way his fellow white people exploit the natives. He strikes up a friendship with Raquel and things blossom into love. Earlier in the film he told one of the white exploiters how awful he thought his practices were. Unmoved by this the exploiter suggests he leave and continuing to do what he did would be hazardous to the doctor's health. Toward the end of the film Monte takes up the cause again and the exploiter keeping his word has him shot. He dies and Raquel is shown weeping over his grave in the final scene. Not that bad a film but the ending left me cold!";

Gladys Cooper is great as the Queen and gives the film some regard it may not have without such a good actress. And Robert Douglas is excellent as a duke our villain who wants to ascend to the throne by marrying the Queen's daughter and getting rid of others in his way. While I never gave Cornel Wilde much consideration before he was quite good and much of the film's dialogue was good without being corny. One line I really appreciated was when Maureen says in response to a man who doesn't fight or duel with a lady that when I fight I'm no lady. If you want a good oldfashioned bpicture that gives its heart to a Dumas classic but really is no classic itself compared to Lana Turner and Gene Kelly's The Three Musketeers then this short adventure is for you.".

	schema:reviewBody "At Sword's Point contains homages to The Three Musketeers and some common conventions for such films. Placed in 1648 it starts with Queen Anne of France Gladys Cooper worried about threats to her throne and her son's succession to the throne. The Duc de Lavalle Robert Douglas is stirring up the nobles who are circling like sharks. The queen has hidden her young son in a monastery to keep him safe from Lavalle. Since Lavalle is unable to find the prince he resorts to plan B he will marry Princess Henriette Nancy Gates. But Henriette despises him and the queen resists all threats. She attempts to contact Spain for assistance but all her messengers are killed en route by Lavalle. Time is of the essence because the queen is sick.She decides to reach out to her trustworthy four musketeers from the past Athos Aramis Porthos and D'Artagnan. If you have not seen The Three Musketeers 1935 you should probably watch that film first. By now the musketeers are older men. Each sends his son in his place except Athos who sends his daughter Claire Maureen O'Hara a fine swordswoman.This story is full of intrigue swordplay and clever twists even if it departs from history. Nods to The Three Musketeers include the passing of the father's sword to the son. Also when the musketeers meet there is swordplay among them to establish their abilities. It should be noted that the swordplay and stuntwork in this film is quite good. Maureen O'Hara displays an athleticism that few actresses could match. Moroni Olsen plays the aged Porthosthe same role he played in the 1935 film.The film uses the common convention of a woman passing as a mansomething that just has to be accepted because there is no way anyone would mistake Maureen O'Hara for a man simply because her hair is under a hat and she is wearing men's breeches.Shot in Technicolor this film is a colorful addition to the Three Musketeers canon. The acting is solid and the action scenes are worth seeing.".

As with many costume pictures made in the early Fifties notably MGM's IVANHOE the action unfolds at a brisk pace leaving viewers little time to notice obvious implausibilities such as the musketeers speaking in a variety of accents ranging from Hollywood English to broad Nebraska. The supporting cast contains a smattering of Brits  to lend classical authenticity including Gladys Cooper delivering her lines in stentorian tones reminiscent of Queen Victoria and in an uncredited role Holmes Herbert who for decades made a habit of playing butlers lords and miscellaneous nobles his cutglass British accent honed in the theater of the early Twenties contrasting with the panoply of other speaking voices on offer.SONS OF THE MUSKETEERS tells a familiar tale but it does so in a highly breezy and entertaining manner.".

But he must have been forced to unlearn whatever he knew of fencing and instead learned the arts of fighting with furniture and holding off hordes of swordsmen with a single blade.The costumes are colorful and the hills of California make a serviceable substitute for France but how to put this? the atmosphere of action and jollity seems forced. The musketeers laugh uproariously at the corniest remarks. Except when fighting they laugh in a most unbuttoned manner. They laugh at each other. They laugh at the enemy. They laugh when they're at death's door. Made me feel like the only person at the party who wasn't stoned.It is however full of gaudy action and a romance between Wilde and O'Hara.

	schema:reviewBody "Usually when films are held up like At Sword's Point are for two years that usually means they're stinkers. I've certainly seen better in the swashbuckling genre. My own opinion is that for whatever reason it was held up RKO decided it might have been to take advantage of the leads being out in big mega hits in 1952 Cornel Wilde in The Greatest Show On Earth and Maureen O'Hara in The Quiet Man. At Sword's Point shows France in the years of Louis XIV's minority having some big trouble. It certainly had its problems in those years but the realm was led by a most capable regent in Cardinal Mazarin and the Queen Mother Anne Of Austria. Mazarin's role has been completely eliminated and Louis has a sister instead of a brother.Anne who is dying of a weak heart is being pressured by the grasping and fictional Duc DeLavalle played by Robert Douglas to marry princess Nancy Gates and steal the throne. The Queen Mother is played proudly and regally by Gladys Cooper. Cooper wishes those guys who saved her bacon back in the day were still around. Well Athos Porthos Aramis and D'Artagnan may not be but their kids have all been taught the Musketeer fighting skills and it's time for a new generation of Musketeers to battle for the honor of the throne.The kids are Cornel Wilde as D'Artagnan Alan HaleJr. as Porthos Dan O'Herlihy as young Aramis and Athos was blessed with a daughter in Maureen O'Hara who keeps up with the boys in terms of fighting skills.One hopes that some kid studying French history doesn't take a short cut and watch this film to learn about France in 1650s. But as a swashbuckler it's not a bad film with heroes and villains cut from some whole cloth. The original Three Musketeers certainly had characters far more complex than these.And hopefully RKO got its money's worth with At Sword's Point in the wake of The Quiet Man and The Greatest Show On Earth.".

And Murray's acting is much better than other Scrooges who usually overact.  Murray manages to be overthetop with his cruelty while still making his acting believable.  Cross is truly Scroogelike reveling in the death of an old woman caused by his commercial because it's free publicity.  Another common comment is that Carol Kane steals the scene as the Ghost of Christmas Present.  Not true.  The chemistry between Murray and Kane ensures that they share the screen perfectly.  This is a wonderful movie.  I can't understand why anyone would say otherwise.  Bobcat Goldthwait puts in a great performance as a disgruntled employee fired on Christmas Eve.  The best part is the end. This movie has what has to be the happiest ending in the history of movies.

It enables a viewer to experience the true meaning of cinema to jump out of our lives and experience another. Once in a long long while we get a movie with as much magically irrelevant context as Richard Donnar's 1988 adaptation of Charles Dickens classic fable. Scrooged holds a place on my list of the top 100 American movies ever made.The film takes place a few days before Christmas. Bill Murray stars as the heartless  Frank Cross a corporate tightwad in charge of a highly profitable television company. This man seldom gives raises  airs stomach churning TV ads and fires desperate employees at the drop of a hat regardless of what time of year it is. Currently Frank's company is producing the first live Christmas program on network television on Christmas eve. It is a Charles Dickens fable. Frank is at the prime of his life living a wealthy glamorous but unhappy life.His greed soon catches up with him however when one night his old boss visits him who has now been dead for years. Frank is at first astonished he thinks he is hallucinating. The talking corpse tells him that  very soon he will be introduced to three ghosts involuntarily. Franks then calls his old girlfriend and continues on with his deprived life.Bill Murray plays his role straight with intensity and imaginationjust like everyone else in the cast. He acts like he is yelling at his workers and they act like they are being yelled at. This is what generates the film all of its laughs. It takes the characters seriously and the comical situations in which they are placed are what makes the film funny.Each of the three ghosts visit Frank. They include The Ghost of Christmas past a rough cigar smoking taxi driver an angelic but brutal pink fairy the Ghost of Christmas Present and the most feared ghost Christmas Future the deathresembling dark capped figure. They each contribute a heartfelt terrifying message to Frank explaining to him how that he either needs to clean up his act and become a giving generous man or dastardly things will happen to him.   The three ghosts are some of the most memorable characters ever seen in the movies. The human characters are also very interesting and entertaining. The filmmakers write each with distributive characteristics provoking empathy and captivation. They are wonderfully portrayed as well.The interlocking stories each related to each other in Richard Donnar's comedy classic as well. Each scene relates to the next with a strong supportive narrative through line through Frank Cross.''Scrooged'' definitely fits into the comedy genre and offers copious amounts of laugh out loud material. There's even dialogue and sight gags that provoke laughter. On the other hand the film doesn't lose track of its message by being all over the wall slapstick silliness. It leaves room for the emotions and feelings present. For this type of comedy to work the humor needs to be played accurately. Some scenes involving the past of Frank are quite emotional and the filmmakers use this to their advantage to develop the Frank character even further. ''Scrooged'' may be a spoof but if still holds true to the classic story it is based on.I also enjoyed the illustrious style this film uses a mesmerizing blend of perfect set direction and colorful atmosphere. The sound track is very effective as well with memorable tunes and voiceless medleys.  The closing scene of ''Scrooged'' may feel a bit contrived and fake but it also allows us to leave the theater with joyful happiness inside. If this film doesn't put you in the Christmas spirit nothing will.Brought to you by Paramount Pictures.".

	schema:reviewBody "Scrooged opens in the clouds and then suddenly descends on a snowbound cottage. Signs inform us that it's Santa's workshop and we're at the North Pole. Inside elves work hastily as Santa prepares himself for his impending duty on Christmas Eve night. But then terrorists packing some serious heat with them lay siege to the workshop.Panicking Santa Mrs. Claus and the elves run towards the back of the shop open a tool cabinet which reveals an arsenal of M16s and soon everybody's armed to the hilt with automatic weaponry. But then Lee Majors appears on a snowmobile and reassures Santa that Christmas will be coming on time this year. Then Lee goes to work killing the terrorists with a large Gatling gun.Then we're treated to a promo spot for a television production of Scrooge which features a bloody highway shooting a plane blowing up and drug addicts taking heroin. It is this sort of cynicism that's underlying in much of the subtext of this film and it's also something that Frank Cross Bill Murray the youngest television president in network history thrives on.And so opens Scrooged director Richard Donner's contemporary take on Charles Dickens's classic tale A Christmas Carol. Dickens's novel has been fodder for countless television film and stage productions over the 150 years it has been an accepted part of American literature and this 1988 dark comedy is the latest incarnation.The biggest reason it has is because it describes the need for mankind to not be so selfish and it takes three ghastly apparitions over the course of a 24hour period to show an old miser the error of his ways.But all of this is in the past. Cross is so swept up in himself that he gives bath towels to everyone even his only brother on Christmas. He asks his loyal secretary Grace Alfre Woodard to stay late at work despite the fact that she has to take her mute son to the doctor. I care! Frank says when she confronts him about it.

Much like the lead character in A Christmas Carol realizes the error of his ways Frank Cross does so too but with a kind of cynicism that could only be provided by someone as indifferent uncompromising and selfish as him. And he's also quite aware from the appearance of the first ghost of what this trip entails.The makeup and special effects are also worthy of some mention. The ghosts all look fantastic even though some would argue that the effects that brought them to life are dated well this movie was made in 1988 for crying out loud!I liked Scrooged as it is certainly a fantastic Christmas movie to watch and is quite funny especially just to see Murray get his comeuppance in a role that seems to suit him perfectly.Watch Bill Murray get Scrooged  1010".

	onyx:emotionText "Scrooged opens in the clouds and then suddenly descends on a snowbound cottage. Signs inform us that it's Santa's workshop and we're at the North Pole. Inside elves work hastily as Santa prepares himself for his impending duty on Christmas Eve night. But then terrorists packing some serious heat with them lay siege to the workshop.Panicking Santa Mrs. Claus and the elves run towards the back of the shop open a tool cabinet which reveals an arsenal of M16s and soon everybody's armed to the hilt with automatic weaponry. But then Lee Majors appears on a snowmobile and reassures Santa that Christmas will be coming on time this year. Then Lee goes to work killing the terrorists with a large Gatling gun.Then we're treated to a promo spot for a television production of Scrooge which features a bloody highway shooting a plane blowing up and drug addicts taking heroin. It is this sort of cynicism that's underlying in much of the subtext of this film and it's also something that Frank Cross Bill Murray the youngest television president in network history thrives on.And so opens Scrooged director Richard Donner's contemporary take on Charles Dickens's classic tale A Christmas Carol. Dickens's novel has been fodder for countless television film and stage productions over the 150 years it has been an accepted part of American literature and this 1988 dark comedy is the latest incarnation.The biggest reason it has is because it describes the need for mankind to not be so selfish and it takes three ghastly apparitions over the course of a 24hour period to show an old miser the error of his ways.But all of this is in the past. Cross is so swept up in himself that he gives bath towels to everyone even his only brother on Christmas. He asks his loyal secretary Grace Alfre Woodard to stay late at work despite the fact that she has to take her mute son to the doctor. I care! Frank says when she confronts him about it. He fires an underling named Eliot Bobcat Goldthwait for questioning him about his unChristmaslike promo ads. He shuns Claire Karen Allen the only woman who's ever cared about him when she tries to provide comfort for the homeless.

I have often found him to be an acquired taste I mean don't get me wrong here I'm a big fan and can repeatedly watch his best offerings but it's not hard to understand why his style is not universally loved. Scrooged is pure and simply the modern spin of the story we all have grown up with that isn't to say that the film loses anything as regards Christmas spirit because it doesn't the message is still the same and in this ever changing world of ours the core essence of the story is one the world should heed.This version is a blast it's loud it's brash but boy is it damn funny and I personally watch it every Christmas without fail. And yes I watch it alongside the glorious Alistair Sim version for although they are poles apart in class they both entertain for very different reasons.Joining Murray in this festive romp is the delightful Karen Allen while luminaries such as former New York Dolls front man David Johansen and Mr. Laconic himself Robert Mitchum add some weight to the cast list. It all works really rather well with the exception of Carol Kane's Ghost Of Christmas Present where to me she comes off as being more annoying than funny but that of course is a personal opinion and I know as fact that many others adore her energetic performance. With quips aplenty and of course with a simple heartfelt message at the core Scrooged is truly a sharp and enjoyable film to be enjoyed at the festive period. Thanks boys get the nurse! 810".

	schema:reviewBody "After Bill Murray struck gold with Ghostbusters in 1984 he dropped off the radar a little. His personal project The Razor's Edge flopped with audiences and critics and I think that must have been a blow to him. Besides making a cameo in the amusing Little Shop of Horrors he stayed away from the Hollywood circuit for four years.But then in 1988 he resurfaced with Scrooged an update on the classic Charles Dickens tale. Obviously trying to repeat the success of Ghostbusters Scrooged was a modest hit with audiences who considered it Murray's comeback role.When I was younger I loved Scrooged. I thought it was funny and delivered on so many levels. But as I've gotten older Scrooged has gone down considerably in my estimation. Instead of feeling funny it now feels laboured and forced. And I never thought I would say this but the main reason Scrooged doesn't work is because of Bill Murray.Bill Murray is one of my favourite comedians. In fact I think he's one of the funniest men alive. His dry laconic outlook on life is nearly always hilarious. Just look at some of the gems he's turned out. Ghostbusters. Groundhog Day. Lost in Translation and the sadly overlooked Broken Flowers.But then there's Scrooged. A film that should have been a perfect vehicle for Murray's talents but it never even gets out of the gate. And I blame that on Murray sadly. He did the theme of a miser seeing the error of his ways to much greater effect in the absolutely wonderful Groundhog Day which is my personal favourite comedy of the 90s.In Scrooged Murray is the borderline powermad TV exec Frank Cross. A man so consumed by greed and hate he thinks nothing of firing employees if they even look at him the wrong way. Frank is on a dangerous path and will lose everything if he doesn't change his ways. And so step in the Ghosts of Christmas Past Present and Future to show Frank what he's missed out on in life.There is some invention during the scenes of ghostly visitations. The Ghost of Christmas Past is a grizzled New York cab driver. The meter is actually a calender that shows the year Murray is in. The Ghost of Christmas Present a horribly screechy performance by Carol Kane is like an insane Sugar Plum Fairy with a nasty habit of punching Frank repeatedly. The Ghost of Christmas Future is just as Dickens left it. Except it has a TV for a face.Usually I like Christmas tales with dark centres like the excellent Nightmare Before Christmas and the hilarious Gremlins. Two brilliant films that succeed on every level. But sadly Scrooged doesn't deliver. Whenever Bill Murray is in a film he's usually the best thing about it. Here he's the worst. He's clearly not having a good time. He approaches each scene with indifference. When he's hands on with material he can deliver superb performances. But he's strictly hands off with this film. And as a result it makes his supposed redemption in the final scenes that all the more false.There are occasions where his trademark sarcasm shines. I liked the scene where he collects an award for Humanitarian of the Year. Its funny because Murray is notorious for shunning the award ceremonies and his clear distaste for the Oscars is mirrored in that scene. His acceptance speech is a marvellous sendup of the countless celebrities who stand up to the mike and drone on and on about their achievements.But elsewhere Scrooged falls flat. There is no evidence that Frank is slowly thawing. And because Murray overacts badly in this film strange considering that he prefers minimalist acting I couldn't believe for a second what I was seeing. Murray spends a lot of his time shouting his way through the film to the point that it becomes tedious.In the supporting cast we do get some occasional rays of sunshine. John Glover is hilarious as the exec brought in to lighten the burden on Frank's shoulders when really he's after his job. John Forsythe sports an astonishing makeup job as Frank's old boss who appears as a decaying corpse the film's version of Marley's Ghost. And the underrated Karen Allen shines as the woman Frank gave up for the sake of his career.But its in the final scenes where Scrooged comes crashing down. Frank has seen the error of his ways. And to prove it he barges on to the set of a live retelling of A Christmas Carol the TV studio is putting on. Frank goes on and on and on about the true meaning of Christmas. And its a horrible thing to see. Murray doesn't sound like he believes a word of what he's saying. It seems to go on forever. And I felt really embarrassed for him.What a pity! Scrooged could have been a hip witty deconstruction of A Christmas Carol. And nobody does nasty and sarcastic better than Bill Murray. Where did it all go wrong then? How did it so completely miss the mark? Shame considering it came from Richard Donner the man behind classics like Superman and The Omen. And such a waste of Robert Mitchum and John Houseman.Very poor and ultimately very depressing too.".

Forcing people to work over the holidays and unwilling to think of anyone but himself.  As Christmas Eve approaches Francis is visited by his dead boss warning him to change his ways when he doesn't he is visited by three ghosts who show him Christmas in the past present and future.Each year there are plenty of versions of the classic Christmas Carol story but this film is consistently one of the better ones.  It starts with a great dark comedy that sees some very imaginative gags The Night The Reindeer Died as well as Murray given great material.  At some point roughly ghost 2 sentimentality starts to set in and the film doesn't quite have the edge on it that it did.  It still works  in fact ghost 3 is not so much sentimental as really dramatic!What holds it all together though is a great performance from Murray.  He is funny throughout but also does the work to try and hold off the sentimentality of the piece  although it does come through as one would expect with a Christmas movie!  The support cast is good and includes Woodard Goldthwait Goulet Farr and Mitchum.  I didn't feel like Kane's Christmas Present really worked and didn't find her funny in the least. While the support cast add to the film it is almost totally belonging to Bill Murray and the fact that it is so enjoyable is mostly due to him although not even he can carry off the audience interaction over the end credits.Overall this is a good Christmas movie  it does give you a nice little festive glow but also has enough cynical edge to keep the syrup at bay for a certain amount of the time.  Regardless of everything else Bill Murray is great in the lead and holds the movie together better than someone else may have been able to.".

The plot is simple  a hard hearted TV exec is shown the folly of his ways by a series ghosts. There are no twists or surprises  the outcome is obvious from the first five minutes but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable.The film is carried by a wonderful performance from Bill Murray  it's hard to imagine it working with anyone else in the lead role. There is a bit of bite to the comedy early one  particularly with the over the top trailer for the night the reindeer died  but this fades over the course of the film.This is not a film for the cynical  it can be overly sentimental at times  but fans of 80s comedies and Murray should find a lot to enjoy here.".

The plot is simple  a hard hearted TV exec is shown the folly of his ways by a series ghosts. There are no twists or surprises  the outcome is obvious from the first five minutes but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable.The film is carried by a wonderful performance from Bill Murray  it's hard to imagine it working with anyone else in the lead role. There is a bit of bite to the comedy early one  particularly with the over the top trailer for the night the reindeer died  but this fades over the course of the film.This is not a film for the cynical  it can be overly sentimental at times  but fans of 80s comedies and Murray should find a lot to enjoy here.";

Once the executive played by Bill Murray gets a heart so to speak then it's time for everybody to feel better about the world and remember what Christmas is about exactly.And just like most other ridiculous Christmas creations out there it is itself a product of the very thing it claims to be warning against. Sure Murray learns his lesson. Sure sensationalist advertisingsaturated promo creation is a Bad Thing rtm. So why mix that message in with a big ol' dolloping of crude humor sexual innuendo and spastic cynicism? Oh because it's making fun of all of that. And selling it at the same time. Or something.Bill Murray also is at a career low here. I don't know how precisely he managed to do this but his delivery in this film makes Groundhog Day seem like a bigger more important holiday than Christmas. This is a vehicle of the worst sort a movie meant to sell with star power where the star basically plays himself but the movie doesn't care enough about what it's doing to give the star any room to shine and as a result the star just gets repetitive and obnoxious in his role. Probably the best example of this is the Oh I get it now! monologue at the end which never really says anything and keeps going on and on as Murray stumbles around throwing out ideas that are less revealing than the ones given to him in the spectral visits.By the time this movie ends one can't help but anticipate the credits to see who's responsible for this stupidity. Surprisingly it's Richard Donner of Goonies and Superman II fame. Huh.PolarisDiB".

	schema:headline " Seasonal Murray vehicle has its moments.";
	schema:reviewBody "The reviews by the critics for this film were terrible. However the general viewer feedback is good. The film has some sappy overblown moments ie. the ending. But its all done in good spirits. If your a Bill Murray fan you'll love it. As the morally redundant TV exec Frank Cross Murray gets far and away the most screen time and his straight faced dry humour is just perfect for this type of character.The film is a modern update of 'A Christmas Carol' for anyone who doesn't already know with the aforementioned Murray character Frank Cross replacing the role of Ebeneezer Scrooge. After being initially visited by his now deceased exbossrepresented rather shockingly as an old decaying mouse infested corpse still wearing the golf uniform he suffered his life ending heart attack in on the fairway and on whom he had based his own career though Frank has gone on to become even more selfish and concerned with the bottom line than even he was Cross simply dismisses the episode as the result of high level executive pressure. In particular Frank is stressing out about his network's live Christmas eve broadcast which is surprise surprise a big budget live version of 'A Christmas Carol'. However he is in turn visited by 3 very different versions of the ghosts of Christmas Past Present and Future to the one's represented in the Dicken's tale  with the possible exception of the final ghost who is much more traditional in representation than the others. The role of Tiny Tim and Bob Cratchet are represented by Cross's long suffering secretary and her young son who is a mute as a result of the trauma of seeing his father murdered several years before. There is a couple of interesting side stories involving Murray rekindling the only real relationship he has ever had with his first love Clare who he decides to recontact amongst all of the madness as well as a confident young new executive who has been brought on board and tries to act as Frank's friend but is clearly planning to usurp him. This attempt is aided by everyone's perception that Frank appears to be suffering some kind of breakdown as he tries to deal with the bizarre impingement on his life by the aforementioned ghosts. Possibly the most entertaining of the story lines not relating directly to the main one involves a naive young board member played by the usually larger than life but here toned down Bobcat Goldthwaite who has been fired as a result of innocently questioning a violent promo for the live show which Cross has commissioned. As Frank is dealing with his ghost's Bobcat's character descends into a rather pathetic depression and desperate alcoholism  in the space of a few days as he tries to come to terms with his unemployment.I really enjoyed John Glover as the slimy Californian exec who is obviously after Cross's job. It kind of underlines the point that though Cross is nasty at least what you see is what you get. Glover's character is completely 2faced. The character obviously made an impact on the makers of Gremlins 2 because they cast Glover in an almost identical role in that movie a mere two years later.Karen Allen as Carol is convincingly sweet and warm as possibly the only person who can truly help redeem Frank but both her and Robert Mitchum as Frank's boss are somewhat underused and in the case of a legendary talent like Mitchum's you almost wonder why he is in it.Anyway in summation if you like Murray you'll love this. If you don't your enjoyment may suffer but there are still laughs to be had at the send ups of Christmas Network programming ie. 'Bob Goulet's Cajun Christmas'  'The Night the Reindeer Died' with Lee Majors and 'Dad Loves Chasing Beaver.' The soundtrack special effects and makeup are also first rate. However be warned it is very dark and at times a little sad particularly in one scene in which Frank reencounters one of the homeless people he had met earlier at Claire's shelter in a disused boiler room on a typically freezing New York winters night. So if your looking for an uplifting fun seasonal movie instead of just a good laugh then avoid this. At least up until the end anyway where they all live happily ever after. I would also not be to keen on showing it to very young kids. Its not exactly a horror film but there are enough moments to scare some children and the humour is for the best part more on the adult side.".

	onyx:emotionText "The reviews by the critics for this film were terrible. However the general viewer feedback is good. The film has some sappy overblown moments ie. the ending. But its all done in good spirits. If your a Bill Murray fan you'll love it. As the morally redundant TV exec Frank Cross Murray gets far and away the most screen time and his straight faced dry humour is just perfect for this type of character.The film is a modern update of 'A Christmas Carol' for anyone who doesn't already know with the aforementioned Murray character Frank Cross replacing the role of Ebeneezer Scrooge. After being initially visited by his now deceased exbossrepresented rather shockingly as an old decaying mouse infested corpse still wearing the golf uniform he suffered his life ending heart attack in on the fairway and on whom he had based his own career though Frank has gone on to become even more selfish and concerned with the bottom line than even he was Cross simply dismisses the episode as the result of high level executive pressure. In particular Frank is stressing out about his network's live Christmas eve broadcast which is surprise surprise a big budget live version of 'A Christmas Carol'. However he is in turn visited by 3 very different versions of the ghosts of Christmas Past Present and Future to the one's represented in the Dicken's tale  with the possible exception of the final ghost who is much more traditional in representation than the others. The role of Tiny Tim and Bob Cratchet are represented by Cross's long suffering secretary and her young son who is a mute as a result of the trauma of seeing his father murdered several years before. There is a couple of interesting side stories involving Murray rekindling the only real relationship he has ever had with his first love Clare who he decides to recontact amongst all of the madness as well as a confident young new executive who has been brought on board and tries to act as Frank's friend but is clearly planning to usurp him. This attempt is aided by everyone's perception that Frank appears to be suffering some kind of breakdown as he tries to deal with the bizarre impingement on his life by the aforementioned ghosts. Possibly the most entertaining of the story lines not relating directly to the main one involves a naive young board member played by the usually larger than life but here toned down Bobcat Goldthwaite who has been fired as a result of innocently questioning a violent promo for the live show which Cross has commissioned. As Frank is dealing with his ghost's Bobcat's character descends into a rather pathetic depression and desperate alcoholism  in the space of a few days as he tries to come to terms with his unemployment.I really enjoyed John Glover as the slimy Californian exec who is obviously after Cross's job.

Scrooged just isn't funny at all and when that's the main selling point in a movie when it doesn't deliver on it it's kinda like what else is there?? Bill Murray was alright as Scrooge not awful or great. Carol Kane was actually pretty good in her role she held her own well. The script is just soso at best nothing much to brag about on that account. There is some nice special effects in the movie for 1988 that is. If you're looking for a nice family Christmas movie to sit down and watch this might possibly be for you it is PG13 and it does have some language in it. You might could catch it on television when it's edited ABC Family and AMC usually show it around Christmas time. But in my personal opinion you can do a lot better. Scrooged is just boring and unfunny and not really sweet or heart warming at all. 310 for Scrooged".

The makers came to the perfect solution let him die but regardlessly continue the series afterwards anyway. It was the least they could do for the novel which was hardly used because obviously it was not very filmable considering that after Winnetou's death it continues for another 126 pages with Old Shatterhand's further adventures. I don't think the movie is remembered for much else than the death sequence though because the story is too simple Winnetou and Old Shatterhand ask the governor for help to keep peace while a villain tries to start war with the Indians. It is an excellent piece of craftsmanship under director Reinl who really managed to create a style that was distinguishable from all other westerns. But Silver Lake and Winnetou 1 were not exceeded by Winnetou 3 anymore.".

The director is Harald Reinl not yet an Oscar nominee at this point but easily among Germany's most successful filmmaker. The ending in this film may be among the most emotional moments from the franchise but the really sad thing is that the rest of the film which means everything that happens in the 75 minutes before does not work in a way that lets the ending appear really heartfelt and authentic. The stories and characters are as generic as in the previous and later films and Brice is once again very forgettable as the title character. I wish they could have cast somebody else. The talent is not there in terms of Brice just the looks and this description also fits this film and the franchise in general. It is all about the costumes landscapes and sets where the action takes place. But the actual plot and story fall very short just like the acting and writing in these films in general. They have not aged well at all by today's standards and compared to some other western films from back in the day especially American ones. I do not recommend Winnetou III. Not at all.".

The sound discs have mostly been lost. The film was also released in a full silent version which exists.This is an astonishing film full of great cinematic scenes and two marvelous star performances. To think that Griffith was considered a has been when he directed this film! Count Arnim William Boyd is bored and is scheduled to marry the Countess Diane Jetta Goudalwhom he does not love but the marriage has been arranged. One night he visits her only to discover her lover sneaking out through a passageway. When he confronts her she admits she is the mistress of the emperor. But he dismisses her saying he'd rather marry a girls of the streets than this dishonest woman. Insulted she hatches a plan to get even.With her accomplice she finds a girl of the streets who can be trained and passed off as a lady to entice the Count. In a squalid cafe they find Nanon Lupe Velez. They offer to pay her for her time to play this joke on the Count. She accepts and is gussied up to be passed off as a Spanish girl of noble blood just out of a convent.Of course the Count instantly falls for Nanon and they plan to marry. At the wedding dinner the cruel Diane announces a special treat for the guests' entertainment. She brings on the orchestra from the cafe and asks Nanon to sing one of her old songs. Humiliated the girl tries to sing but breaks down and confesses all.Diane sure of her revenge boasts as the guests leave that the has given the count just what he asked for a girl of the streets. But Nanon stands up to the Countess and admits she was a cafe singer but never a girl of the streets. She tells the story of deceit to the Count and then repeats the story to the guests still milling about. The Countess Diane is left alone in the room a figure of scorn.While William Boyd hasn't much to do here as the Count the two leading ladies tear the place apart. Fiery Lupe Velez is superb as Nanon taking full advantage of the comic scenes but then turning in a terrific dramatic performance in the finale. Jetta Goudal is gorgeous and lethal as Diane using her haughty beauty to good effect.Costars include Henry Armetta as Pierre Franklin Pangborn as the dance master Albert Conti as Finot George Fawcett as the Baron and William Bakewell as the pianist.Karl Struss was the cinematographer and there are several great camera shots. In one as William Boyd looks out a window as a departing coach the camera follows his gaze out the window and down into the street and then reverses direction up and back through the window and past Boyd and across the room. It seems to be all one shot. In the finale when Lupe Velez is sure she has lost Boyd she looks out and suddenly all the men in the room become William Boyd.The Irving Berlin song Where Is the Song of Songs for Me is nicely sung by Velez and makes for a nice theme throughout the film.For those who think Griffith could only do epics and rural melodrama this is a mustsee film.".

Crowe Charles Bronson  he was about sixtyseven years of age who takes on a pimp Juan Fernandez and a slimy hoodlum Sy Richardson whose speciality is recruiting adolescents including the daughter of a Japanese business man James Pax. The lieutenant married to Kathleen Peggy Limpton has a teenager girl Amy Hathaway and is helped by another policeman Perry Lopez. He then stalks the baddies and takes the law into his own hands  acting as judge  jury and executioner  searching vengeance on crooks  pimps making the neighborhood safer and bumping off delinquents and street scum.This standard Bronson movie is full of action  thrills and disturbing scenes . Bronson in his usual stoic acting displays efficiently his weapons such as Harry the Dirty and killing mercilessly nasties . This is the last movie Charles Bronson made for Cannon Films and it represents the tenth and final of ten teamings between producer Pancho Kohner and star actor Bronson . It's certainly thrilling  though the morality may be questionable  even in this time as the spectators were clearly on the Lt. Crowe Bronson's side . Disagreeable scenes and loathing theme as abuse of children with terrible end . Screen debut from Baywatch's Nicole Eggert as a teen prostitute and Danny Trejo as an inmate in a final brief appearance almost extra . Unappropiated and anticlimatic musical score composed by means of synthesizer . The fare was badly directed by J.

His two biggest successes turned out to be Guns of Navaroneand Cape Fear. Thereafter  the filmmaker's career subsided in a morass of slickly realized but middling films . He moved into the field of international spectaculars  at which point his filmmaking seemed to lose its individuality . J. Lee Thompson working from the 50s in England finished his career making Chuck Norris Firewalker and Charles Bronson vehicles Caboblanco Evil that men do  Messenger of death Death Wish 4  Crackdown Caboblanco St Ives. Rating  Below average . Lousy results for this disagreeable thriller that has many depressing failures.".

He then stalks the baddies and takes the law into his own hands  acting as judge  jury and executioner  searching vengeance on crooks  pimps making the neighborhood safer and bumping off delinquents and street scum.This standard Bronson movie is full of action  thrills and disturbing scenes . Bronson in his usual stoic acting displays efficiently his weapons such as Harry the Dirty and killing mercilessly nasties . This is the last movie Charles Bronson made for Cannon Films and it represents the tenth and final of ten teamings between producer Pancho Kohner and star actor Bronson . It's certainly thrilling  though the morality may be questionable  even in this time as the spectators were clearly on the Lt. Crowe Bronson's side . Disagreeable scenes and loathing theme as abuse of children with terrible end . Screen debut from Baywatch's Nicole Eggert as a teen prostitute and Danny Trejo as an inmate in a final brief appearance almost extra . Unappropiated and anticlimatic musical score composed by means of synthesizer . The fare was badly directed by J. Lee Thomson  in his last one  he previously had a nice track record in the English cinema from 1950 until 1961  directing good Western McKenna's gold  White Buffalo and all king genres as SciFi Conquest and Battle of planet of apes terror reincarnation of Peter Proud Eye of the devil adventures Flame over India Kings of the sun Taras Bulba  Tiger Bay and Warlike Guns of Navarone Von Braun  Chairman  The passage . His two biggest successes turned out to be Guns of Navaroneand Cape Fear. Thereafter  the filmmaker's career subsided in a morass of slickly realized but middling films . He moved into the field of international spectaculars  at which point his filmmaking seemed to lose its individuality . J. Lee Thompson working from the 50s in England finished his career making Chuck Norris Firewalker and Charles Bronson vehicles Caboblanco Evil that men do  Messenger of death Death Wish 4  Crackdown Caboblanco St Ives. Rating  Below average . Lousy results for this disagreeable thriller that has many depressing failures.";

As with most Bronson films he deals out his own brand of justice rather then doing it by the book. As one reviewer said already this is truly a movie about what goes around comes around. For instancethe father of the Japanese girl molests Bronsons daughter on a bus and ironically its his daughter that gets snatched by the pimp duke. Forbidden Subjects does not contain the large body count that Bronson racks up in other movies but contains some great moments such as Bronson forcing the pimp to eat his diamond Rolex and then let some jailbird have his way with the pimp thats justice. Although the subject matter is a bit sickening the movie is well made and the actors do a good job with there roles. Although Bronson is by far not the best actor in Hollywood there are far worse actors out there getting praise for nothing. Overall its good for a watch but I would probably skip on buying it.".

Probably because the output of nine joint ventures between the two of them runs the gamut from the really good action entertainment to the mediocre. Unfortunately Kinjite Forbidden Subjects falls in the latter. That's sad because Kinjite could have been a whole lot better. But for the life of me I don't understand why it was necessary to make the father of the missing Japanese girl a guy used to getting some cheap jollies because the romance in his marriage has run out. That might have been good for another film altogether but it served no purpose here.A straightforward cop drama with Charles Bronson as a vice cop who's seen a bit too much in his line of work and has a strong prejudice against orientals. That part could also have used a little explaining as well. But he's going to have to overcome it if he and patient partner Perry Lopez are going to locate a captured Japanese school girl.Bronson's time in the vice squad have told him exactly where to look for the kidnapper. A stylish murderous pimp played by Jaime Fernandez is the guy and he and Bronson have some history. In fact in the film's best scene Bronson made him eat an expensive rolex watch and set his car on fire.At one point Fernandez happens to spot Bronson and Lopez in an all night delicatessen and this being after his rolex snack he sprays the place with an Uzi killing everyone but Bronson and Lopez. I really think that little incident would have had more than a couple vice cops from the LAPD after Fernandez. But that's another terribly big hole in the plot.Still there is a very rough justice in the end for Fernandez. I wish the whole film had been better though. This was the last film of the BronsonThompson team and J. Lee Thompson's last as a director. He should have gone out with something better.".

At 68 and with a string of mediocre action thrillers littering his 1980s output this sleazy cop movie turned out to be one of his better efforts of the decade. Bronson plays vice detective Crowe a racist veteran of the force who has grown weary of seeing the scum of Los Angeles dragging innocent children into prostitution and drugs. A parallel storyline follows visiting Japanese businessman Hiroshi Hada James Pax who struggles to adapt to American values and soon after arriving loses his young daughter to slimy pimp Duke Juan Fernandez. Crowe has already had runins with Duke so when he is assigned to find Hada's daughter the stories merge with tragic results. Bronson is still trim and performs well as Crowe with several good action sequences. Largely maligned as an actor because he underplayed his leading roles Bronson always fit this type of role because you could believe that he actually does the things he is portraying. There is a nice little scene involving an ethnic event where Crowe vents his frustration on some startled Japanese that speaks volumes about character motivation. Juan Fernandez is exceptional as Duke and makes his character truly evil. Veteran British director J. Lee Thompson does a fair job of keeping the movie plugging along and has a great set piece at the end of the movie involving a crane and crashing automobiles. The subject matter isn't as exploited as it could have been but it's still pretty rough and loaded with nudity and violence. Bronson fans won't be disappointed and even nonfans like my wife enjoyed it.".

The film has strong moments but it also suffers at times from overly lazy dialogue direction and overall storytelling and it's hard to forget the painfully bad 80's music in this film. The fight scenes are also far from great however there is enough grit sleaze and action to make the film a worthy watch for many. The film is undoubtedly a fairly confused morality tale or perhaps a morality tale within a confused society is the better way of describing it. In the end the film does rely on a sort of karmic justice to satisfy it's audience and to a decent degree it works at times however it just leaves us asking some very strange questions. Of other note there is an early but very small appearance by Danny Trejo in the film as well as a decent performance from a very young Nicole Eggert as well as a strong performance by the little known but hard to take your eyes off of Amy Hathaway. Worth a look for some but not to be touched with a ten foot pole by others. My rating... 5.510".

This is probably the pairs' most daring work yeah more so than The Evil That Men Do 1984 and fittingly the last they would make together in a technically wellmade fable. What ruffled a lot of feathers when this came out was the exploitative topics at hand child prostitution repressed sexual desire and drug addiction and the way they were handled and brought across.

The ugliness of these facets definitely creeps in but the emotional drive while being there feels quite thin with an uneasy and bitter underbelly taking hold. Thompson's sufficiently polished direction though a more raw edge to it would've been better paints a rotten grimy and scummy texture through heavy atmospheric vibes than anything visually punishing. Gideon Porath's leering cinematography streamlined the feature. For a Bronson film action makes little headway. Quite strange but its slow going pace lets the basic premise evolve with its two separate stories eventually interlocking with each other with a neat slice of irony and karma which made the material not so predictable and largely authentic. However don't worry too much as Bronson does gets his hands dirty just the way we like it too. Serving out his 'own' unpleasant justice in few memorable sequences! Some might say that Bronson in the latter end of his career mainly through the 80s made a living out of the same character and motivation. But an earnestly scathing script helps give Bronson something interesting to work with even a bit of western and eastern crossculture differences plant themselves in early and play a bigger part to story's progression and makes for a weathered but righteously hardhitting performance of a multifacet character. In support Juan Hernandez's seedy pimp is a disturbingly slimy portrayal and James Pax's square Japanese businessman with an uncontrollable sexual urge effectively counterpunches Bronson and Hernandez's characters. None of these are clean characters even though Bronson has the badge. He shows his insecurity of the subject and uses it to make his actions justified. In the lesser costarring roles is an exceptional Peggy Lipton as Bronson's wife. Perry Lopez is good in the loyal but tired cop partner. An imposing Sy Richardson plays one of Hernandez's goons. Amy Hathaway shines as Bronson's on screen daughter and Kumiko Hayakawa impresses with a movingly gusty turn as the young kidnapped girl. As for Greg De Belles' funky music score I found it sloppy and unsuited instead of sapping bleakness.

In J Lee Thompson's final film KINJITE is obviously an indictment on the exploitation of teenage girls and how they are consumed by lecherous fiends who promise them great things in exchange for prostituting themselves. There's also a statement through the character of Crowe about the discontenting nature of festering racism..take the scene where Crowe becomes enraged with Japanese tourists and businessmen who he considers invaders buying up everything in America. This racism extends from an incident where Hiroshi himself cops a feel of Crowe's daughter while she and some of her friends are on board a bus heading homeCrowe doesn't know who it was exactly just some Oriental guy. Thompson and company know how far to go and thank goodness Crowe's family isn't raped and murdered as was often the case in the Winner DEATH WISH movies. By '89 Bronson could no longer hide the fact that he was around 70 years old and that his geriatric cop hero roles were soon to be retired. Unbelievable as it might be Bronson would actually return to his Kersey role five years later for DEATH WISH V not to mention the A FAMILY OF COPS series even as he was approaching 80! Fernandez is a really depraved kind of monster who actually gets off a bit easier than you'd thinkhell even a client of Fernandez although offscreen gets a dildo up his ass by Crowe! though his fate is rather fitting. The subject matter for this film is really offputting but relevant and Thompson uses subtlety instead of elaborating in exact detail. Thompson's actionpacked finale lets him go out with quite a bang as explosions and machine gun fire there are aplenty.".

This racism extends from an incident where Hiroshi himself cops a feel of Crowe's daughter while she and some of her friends are on board a bus heading homeCrowe doesn't know who it was exactly just some Oriental guy. Thompson and company know how far to go and thank goodness Crowe's family isn't raped and murdered as was often the case in the Winner DEATH WISH movies. By '89 Bronson could no longer hide the fact that he was around 70 years old and that his geriatric cop hero roles were soon to be retired. Unbelievable as it might be Bronson would actually return to his Kersey role five years later for DEATH WISH V not to mention the A FAMILY OF COPS series even as he was approaching 80! Fernandez is a really depraved kind of monster who actually gets off a bit easier than you'd thinkhell even a client of Fernandez although offscreen gets a dildo up his ass by Crowe! though his fate is rather fitting. The subject matter for this film is really offputting but relevant and Thompson uses subtlety instead of elaborating in exact detail. Thompson's actionpacked finale lets him go out with quite a bang as explosions and machine gun fire there are aplenty.";

	schema:reviewBody "The '80's were not very kind to onetime major star Charles Bronson. Starting with 1982's Death Wish II and ending with this truly gruesome film from '89 Bronson's screenwriters seemed to be trying to top each other in progressive grossness. D.W. II left little to the imagination in its depiction of the rape and suicide of Bronson's character's daughter a rape and murder of his housekeeper was also shown in disgusting detail. 10 to Midnight was the sort of loathsome film that made you want to take a bath afterwards. Nothing redeeming about it. Other films like The Evil that Men Do and the remaining Death Wish films from this period straddled the line between high camp and high barf with their earnest depictions of brutality and revenge. I'm not sure if the producers usually Pancho Kohner got a kick out of showing a weary looking senior citizenaged Bronson destroying punks young enough to be his grandchildren or what but the shoddy craftsmanship and terrible scripts of these films usually destroyed what little energy they may have generated.Kinjite  the last of these films  is fairly wellmade but truly takes the cake in cinematic wretchedness. In this film Bronson sodomizes a perverse john forces a pimp to eat his Rolex watch  allows a male prisoner to get raped by another prisoner makes incredibly xenophobic remarks among other things I've thankfully forgotten. Also depicted is the gangrape of a young Japanese girl fortunately this was offscreen though wellimplied.What were people thinking when they made this film? What was Bronson thinking when he decided to ruin his career with these horrible films? For anyone interested in his best movies check out most of the films he made in the '60's and '70's like The Mechanic Death Wish From Noon til 3 Once Upon a Time in the West Red Sun The Great Escape The Magnificent Seven Rider on the Rain etc. etc....".

	schema:headline " Unpleasant actioner is last of BronsonThompson pairing";
	schema:reviewBody "In 1975 Charles Bronson was introduced to British director J. Lee Thompson on the Warner Brothers crime story 'St. Ives.' The two artists found an immediate groove and began one of the most unheralded collaborations in film history. Bronson and Thompson made nine films over thirteen years sometimes uneven in their work but rarely failing to entertain. During the 1980s Thompson directed Bronson through some of his most rugged outings including '10 to Midnight' 'The Evil That Men Do' and 'Kinjite Forbidden Subjects.''Kinjite Forbidden Subjects' Bronson's final appearance for the Cannon Group and the last film directed by Thompson closed out the 80s on a vicious but highly effective note for both men. Written by Harold Nebenzal associate producer of 1972's 'Cabaret' 'Kinjite' deals with sensitive issues  child prostitution and sexual mores  while paying homage to the decade's crime exploitation genre. The film is an odd mix of social commentary and action which both helps and hinders its viewing power.Bronson plays Lieutenant Crowe a bigoted Los Angeles vice detective who is fed up with the ills of society and considering retirement. In a subplot that will later intertwine Japanese businessman Hiroshi Hada James Pax has accepted a position with his company in L.A. He must quickly adapt to American culture particularly in the sexual arena. Hada is a womanizer voyeur and heavy drinker who mingles with prostitutes in bars intently views women being felt up on crowded subway trains and holds an ambivalent attitude over the feelings of his wife played by Marion Yue.Hada molests Crowe's teenaged daughter Rita Amy Hathaway while drunk on a bus which heightens Crowe's prejudices towards the Asian community. In an ironic twist Hada's own daughter Fumiko Kumiko Hayakawa is kidnapped by Duke Juan Fernndez a local pimp who specializes in minors. Crowe already fuming over the molestation of his daughter by an 'oriental' but not aware of Hada's involvement is assigned to the case and must overcome his racist feelings to save her.Bronson and Thompson were never shy about depicting unpleasant situations and it's no surprise that 'Kinjite' holds nothing back. Harold Nebenzal's script contains everything from teenage prostitution to sadomasochism to drug use to gang rape to torture although most of this is alluded to or represented offscreen. In the opening sequence alone Crowe and his partner Rios Perry Lopez bust an older john with Bronson ready to inflict punishment via a dildo before the scene ends. Later on Crowe makes Duke drive at gunpoint to a vacant lot forces him to swallow yes swallow his diamondstudded wristwatch and nonchalantly sets his Cadillac on fire. Racist overtones abound with Crowe chewing out a group of Japanese who are blocking traffic in front of the Los Angeles Hilton.'Kinjite' reaches depraved heights when Duke begins 'renting out' Fumiko to wealthy clientle. Perversion is only discussed but these chats are more than enough to generate outrage. While 'Kinjite' is designed largely to shock and offers no palpable solutions to the reallife trafficking of minors it never fails to shed light on a problem that is rarely thought about. Bronson gives one of the strongest performances in his career helped by a solid supporting cast with Lopez Peggy Lipton as Crowe's wife Bill McKinney as a Catholic priest and Fernndez as an irritating scumoftheearth. Thompson's direction is his best in years keeping a tight pace and easily alternating between Los Angeles and Tokyo. Excellent cinematography by Gideon Porath 'Death Wish 4' gives 'Kinjite' a cold unpleasant gloss.While 'Kinjite' is handled with competence there are also signs of a film that was rushed through Cannon's last days. The film suffers from mediocre editing by Mary Jochem and Thompson's son Peter who make embarrassing goofs in continuity. The soundtrack by Greg De Belles TV's 'Sabrina the Teenage Witch' nicely contrasts L.A.'s 'riffraff' atmosphere with the serenity of Japan but his music is synthesized rather than played by an orchestra. Also look for a change in race after Duke's enforcer Lavonne Sy Richardson falls from an apartment balcony into a swimming pool Lavonne is black but the stunt double floating underwater is obviously white.The main flaw however is Kinjite's lack of focus on serious issues. Had 'Kinjite' devoted more time to social commentary and less to action it may have risen far above its exploitation status. There are major gaps in plot serious questions are never delved into and it seems as if Crowe can find Duke in Los Angeles on a moment's notice. Bronson is solid throughout but the role could have been his absolute best of the 1980s with superior writing. As a finished product 'Kinjite' at least brings an unpleasant and usually ignored problem to the surface. Crowe is certainly one of Bronson's most assertive parts and a strong finish to his lowbudget era that began with 'Death Wish II.' 'Kinjite' was recently offered on DVD by MGM Home Entertainment who holds marketing rights to the Cannon Group's library. The disc is in widescreen and standard format with Dolby presentation of the original mono track French dubbing is included with subtitles in English French and Spanish. Despite budget limitations Cannon's last films are of good visual quality including 'Kinjite.' Gideon Porath's searing images come through nicely and Greg De Belles's dynamic soundtrack is clear on speakers. The only extra is Kinjite's theatrical trailer which is expected for a film that has slipped into obscurity. 'Kinjite' is repugnant and will never be fully accepted but it's certainly an impressive end to the decade for Bronson and Thompson.  out of 4Roving Reviewer  www.geocities.compauljohnr".

	schema:reviewBody "In some ways I'm glad I saw this film. For one thing I learned how to pronounce the title correctly. Kinjite mean forbidden in Japanese and the accent is on the first syllable not the second.It's an ambitious film too with a moral lesson built into it that we are all brothers and sisters under our differently colored skins. Further Charles Bronson is not his usual typical action hero. He's a flawed detective. He's prejudiced against the Japanese who he believes are taking over the country. He steps out of his police car and shouts epithets and orders harshly at a gaggle of polite Japanese tourists whose cars are blocking the street. You think you OWN the place! and so forth. The picture was released in 1989. Michael Creighton's novel Rising Sun appeared at about the same time. That was when the mania about Japanese business practices was at its height and shortly before the Japanese economy imploded and sank to the bottom of the aquarium where it rests gasping today.The plot has two strands that come together towards the end. In Tokyo a naive young Japanese businessman Karuko lives in a companionate marriage with his sensitive intelligent wife and innocent tenyearold daughter Fumiko. On a crowded subway he watched an attractive lady being felt up by some pervert and she seems distressed signs he interprets as an orgasm rather than humiliation.Karuko moves with his family to Los Angeles where his daughter is kidnapped gangraped and forced into whoredom by a nefarious Latino named Duke. But before that happens he finds himself on a bus in Los Angeles seated next to Bronson's fifteenyearold daughter. Still believing that young girls like to be secretly felt up in public Karuko slips his hand under her skirt. She shrieks and runs off the bus with her friends. What happened? they ask her. Some Asian guy touched my holy of holies she says brushing the incident aside with a quip.Bronson and his partner played by Perry Lopez whom you may remember as Lieutenant Escobar in Chinatown are assigned to the case. Bronson begs to be reassigned. He hates Asians and wants nothing to do with them. But one of those blustering nononsense superiors chews him out and sets him and Lopez on the case.It's during his interview with Karuko and his wife when Karuko breaks down and sobs that Bronson's prejudice begins to melt. Bronson and Lopez finally recapture Fumiko and return her to her family but her shame is boundless and she commits suicide. Now Bronson goes after Duke with a vengeance and the film ends with an explosive and bloody shoot out on the docks at I think San Pedro.It's easy to see how this could have been an effective movie full of action suspense and yet provocatively done. But it largely fails. I don't know exactly why. Part of it is probably due to the cheapness of Golam and Globus the producers. They have a reputation in the industry. They're like characters out of Dickens chuckling as they count out the pennies they managed to save today. If a scene calls for a full lawn instead of calling in a greensman they sprinkle the lawn with green confetti. That example isn't made up. Bronson couldn't have cost much. By 1989 he was no longer the strapping exminer with the chiseled face and bronze pectorals of his youth. And he was sometimes enjoyable but rarely a performer to be taken seriously. Perry Lopez with a respectable career in supporting roles behind him has aged until he's almost unrecognizable  not his fault to be sure  and puts virtually nothing into the role. The Asians can't act with the exception of Karuko's wife who is convincing. The role of Duke played by Juan Fernandez is strictly one dimensional. He's pure evil. Not colorfully evil. Not suave or anything. Just a tattooed and perverted Beaner as far as this movie is concerned.The plot is clumsy and without subtlety a disappointment considering its potential. It was written by Harold Nebenzal whose primary career was in production not writing. Shifting as it does between Tokyo and LA for the first half hour with no connection between the two leaves a viewer feeling as if he's fighting his way through a thicket of thorns hoping it will all turn out okay in the end. Director J. Lee Thompson responsible for The Guns of Navarone and other epics was pushing eighty and his best films were behind him.Yet there are some moving moments in it. There can't help but be. Karuko finds himself in a position where he must thank the Bronson family for finding his daughter. He brings a present for Bronson's own blond teen ager the one he fondled on the bus. And it's an exquisite doll of a Japanese woman in traditional dress encased in a glass box. He recognizes her and she recognizes him but neither says a word about the incident.And the scene is which Fumiko takes a lethal dose of pills then arranges her colorfully clad little body on the bed and waits to die is poignant. She and her kimono remind us of the doll in the glass case both pretty both easily shattered.".

	onyx:emotionText "In some ways I'm glad I saw this film. For one thing I learned how to pronounce the title correctly. Kinjite mean forbidden in Japanese and the accent is on the first syllable not the second.It's an ambitious film too with a moral lesson built into it that we are all brothers and sisters under our differently colored skins. Further Charles Bronson is not his usual typical action hero. He's a flawed detective. He's prejudiced against the Japanese who he believes are taking over the country. He steps out of his police car and shouts epithets and orders harshly at a gaggle of polite Japanese tourists whose cars are blocking the street. You think you OWN the place! and so forth.

I strongly oppose political correctness in films and I have no problem with a movie glorifying violence and vigilantism. However this last collaboration of Charles Bronson and director J. Lee Thompson is so far out there it is sometimes difficult to enjoy. While the other ThompsonBronson collaborations 10 TO MIDNIGHT THE EVIL THAT MEN DO DEATH WISH 4 MURPHY'S LAW... were the opposite of politically correct which is something I enjoy KINJITE  FORBIDDEN SUBJECTS of 1989 is so full of glorification of police sadism and blatant racism that it is hard not to wonder whether Thompson's main intent was to overtrump his previous movies in wrongness.SPOILERS Bronson is more willing than ever to bend the law in the role of toughcop Lt. Crowe. Within the first five minutes of the film he verbally abuses an Indian man in a racist rant and assaults a man suspected of sex with underage prostitutes with a dildo !. His main concern is bringing the evil pimp Duke Juan Fernndez to justice. After his teenage daughter is groped by a drunk Japanese businessman he furthermore keeps ranting about orientals. The highlights in the dubious protagonist's behavior are moments when he forces a suspect to devour a Rolex Watch ! or sets a guy up to be raped in prison !!.I cannot claim that the film isn't entertaining. It is. But on a very low and nearly despicable level. The socalled moral message of the film may well be described as fascist. I never have a problem with cinematic cops bending the law or people taking the law in their own hands in films however the manner of how the whole thing is glorified here is rather disgusting at times. Even worse the film is blatantly racist. All the male Japanese characters are perverted drunks whose hobbies include groping and degrading girls. The one reasonable Japanese character is a woman who was 'raised in a Western manner'. All the villains are Latinos and blacks whereas the good guys are white cops. Bronson's characters' overprotectiveness of his daughter sometimes seems to go beyond the usual fatherdaughter protectiveness. Bronson generally doesn't seem too enthusiastic about this film. The 67yearold actually seems annoyed by yet another typecasting. By the time this film was made medication had rid Bronson of his rough facial features which in combination with his obvious lack of enthusiasm makes him seem like an angry old guy who hates everybody rather than the tough guy he used to be in earlier films. Still watching Bronson in action is the main aspect that makes this film worth watching. The best performance comes from villain Juan Fernndez who is truly despicable and evil in his role.The combination of Bronson as star and Thompson in the director's chair never was an avatar of subtlety. And one would not want it to be. In watching a BronsonThompson film one will expect testosteronedriven brutal and sadistic politically incorrect entertainment which is perfectly fine. This film's racism and fascistic message are hard to digest however. As said it may entertain but it does so in a very low manner.".

The action scenes are kept to a minimum and Charles Bronson had some pretty funny lines. The main reason why I like Kinjite Forbidden Subjects is that you can tell that there was an effort to make it work. It wasn't your typical Charles Bronson fare and that made it appealing. My biggest gripe with the film is that the same guy that molested Crowe's daughter is never dealt with. That just doesn't sit too well with me but other than that it was a good movie.Its easy to slam this movie based on a subject matter that repulses most people but that isn't being fair. Child prostitution is a reality so bashing a movie for showing a reality is pretty damn stupid. But what can you expect from the same critics that gave Speed 2 Booze Control two thumbs up? If you love the late Charles Bronson's movies than you cant go wrong with Kinjite Forbidden Subjects. Its better than the weak link of the Death Wish series.".

In it he plays a detective who goes to great lengths to track down a pimp who has abducted an Asian girl and is currently selling her to the highest bidder. It's a shameful attempt at action and is quite possibly the most depressing movie ever made. A lot of people consider the Death Wish sequels to be Bronson's worst movies. The Death Wish sequels weren't great movies but were in most cases competently made and very watchable. Kinjite however is an utterly dull thriller which is punctuated by mean spirited racism and child molestation. It really is a rephrensible film and all of it is made worse by the fact that it tries to preach a Law and Justice mentality that is too overwrought to really say anything. Indeed the movie begins with underage sex being interrupted with Bronson then anally raping the pedophile with a dildo. The Chicago theater I watched this in just gasped at the awkwardness of this scene only to gasp at the awkwardness of the pimp raping the girl in this film. It has no point other than to exploit and really the movie wasn't well written enough to rise above the exploitation level and deliver something that would work. Bronson seems more into things but clearly this is far too repugnant to save. I want to point out that I think Charles Bronson is the coolest actor ever but this effort is ultimately his worst. The action sequences are poor also.12 out of 4Awful".

This had to be the most depraved and sleaziest film he's ever participated in and that's saying something!.Charlie Bronson plays a W.a.s.p.y type of cop who's stuck on a case that involves a teenage prostitution ring. Poor Chuck hit rock bottom in this one. The things he does to round up the dirt bags who are behind this operation will surprise and shock you. Although the movie is bad it's perversely entertaining however. Especially the scuzzy Latino pimp who has a fate that I wished all people like him would have.If you're a fan of Charlie Bronson don't miss this one. All others stay away and watch Schindler's List or Sleepless in Seattle. Classic Charlie Bronson.Recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having seen their collaborations 10 to Midnight The Evil that Men Do Murphy's Law Death Wish IV Messenger of Death and now Kinjite Forbidden Subjects I can't help thinking that Charles Bronson and his buddy director J. Lee Thompson didn't give a damn about moral values anymore during the 1980's. Both gentlemen were in the very final phase of their long and respectable careers and they still wanted to make some action movies together but it feels like they remained stuck in the gritty and exploitative 1970's. All their 80's films are excessively violent uncompromising in themes politically  morally incorrect and often downright racist and offensive. Kinjite Forbidden Subjects is all of the above and even worse. Actually it would have been better for both Bronson and Thompson that this film had never been made. It's a vile film stuffed with sickening undertones and harsh xenophobic dialogs. Charles Bronson also didn't appear to be the least bit interested in playing yet another tough copper character and noticeably has trouble memorizing his lines. I mean he was never the greatest actor in the world but if you compare his performance here with films like say Mr. Majestyk and The Mechanic it's more than obvious that he was tired of his typecasting. And still the racism and Charlie's uninterested performance aren't the worst things about Kinjite Forbidden Subjects. This film has a completely incoherent implausible and downright dumb screenplay! Los Angeles Police Lieutenant Crowe and his partner Eddie although both clearly past their lawful pension age are on the trail of supergangster Duke who's running a perverted network of underage prostitutes that he picks up from the streets or even kidnaps from their schools. Parallel with the plot the film also introduces the sleazy Tokyo businessman Hiroshi Hada. Although married and father of two daughters he fantasizes about fondling school girls on the metro and American prostitutes. When he travels to LA you automatically expect that he will team up with Duke or at least become his most loyal customer but no. Duke kidnaps the Japanese guy's oldest daughter and enrolls her into prostitution. Just before that he touched the private parts of Crowe's teenage daughter on the bus but all of a sudden that doesn't matter anymore. The script is a ridiculous mess no wonder Charles Bronson looks so confused. If you like wrong 80's action movies the film is nevertheless worth checking out even if only to see a handful of preposterously absurd and unintentionally hilarious sequences. For example Crowe and his partner want to frighten one of Duke's accomplices by holding his upside down from a hotel balcony but then accidentally drop him for real! The look on their faces is priceless. The most jawdropping scene however takes place inside Duke's fancy Cadillac. He intends to bribe Crowe by offering his 20.000 gold Rolex watch. What does Charlie do? He makes him EAT the watch! And as you can imagine it's not a charming sight.".

	schema:reviewBody "First and foremost this is a Masterclass in the Art of Screen Acting by two of the most distinguished practitioners of that Art. Nine out of ten people who are interested in the comments of a film like this one will be fully conversant with the outstanding contribution made to Cinema by Jean Gabin and Simone Signoret but my time posting comments on this board has been punctuated at irregular intervals by PMs from teenagers anxious to learn more about the kind of cinema where popcorn both in a carton and between the ears is not a condition of admission to the auditorium and with that albeit tiny readership in mind I'll perhaps inform them and remind the more mature that Jean Gabin spent 15 years in the French Music Hall before turning to film in 1928 since when he graced such Classics as La Belle Equipe Pepe Le Moko Quai des Brumes Le Jour se leve La Grande Illusion Remorques Touchezpas au grisbi La Traversee de Paris Melodie soussol to merely scratch the surface whilst Simone Signoret although beginning somewhat later 1942 notched up an equally impressive CV the early success Dedee d'Anvers was directed by her first husband Yves Allegret and she went on to feature in such classic titles as La Ronde Casque d'Or Les Diaboliques Armee des Ombres and the English film Room At The Top a performance which netted her the very first Best Actress Oscar awarded to a nonAmerican actress. These then were the dual backgrounds and experience that these great actors brought to Le Chat and once again I find myself reporting on a film in the wake of other raves and once again I am both pleased and honored to add my voice to those others. As a Case History of a relationship that has soured to the point of bitterness and virtually no communication this movie hits every target at which it aims. There are long stretches at the beginning where we have only nonverbal acting of the highest order to tell us  and I use that word deliberately rather than 'show'  what is going on what has GONE on and what WILL be the inevitable conclusion. Monitoring the emptiness the hollowness the bitterness of this relationship it's almost impossible  despite subtle reminders  to imagine that these people had once loved each other so much that they had chosen to spend their lives together. Now inexplicably and unobtrusively that love has disintegrated til Julien Gabin loves only his cat Greffier whilst Signoret still yearns wistfully for the love that has been lost. Most of the other comments here speak of depression sadness and other negatives yet I did not find it so. True there is little or nothing uplifting about such a story  especially so since the neighboring buildings are being pulled down around them and in yet another metaphor their house is shown in earlier times to form a natural culdesac at rightangles to the others  but Great Acting will always transcend melodramatic emotion and screen Acting doesn't come Greater than this. Brilliant.".

Nine out of ten people who are interested in the comments of a film like this one will be fully conversant with the outstanding contribution made to Cinema by Jean Gabin and Simone Signoret but my time posting comments on this board has been punctuated at irregular intervals by PMs from teenagers anxious to learn more about the kind of cinema where popcorn both in a carton and between the ears is not a condition of admission to the auditorium and with that albeit tiny readership in mind I'll perhaps inform them and remind the more mature that Jean Gabin spent 15 years in the French Music Hall before turning to film in 1928 since when he graced such Classics as La Belle Equipe Pepe Le Moko Quai des Brumes Le Jour se leve La Grande Illusion Remorques Touchezpas au grisbi La Traversee de Paris Melodie soussol to merely scratch the surface whilst Simone Signoret although beginning somewhat later 1942 notched up an equally impressive CV the early success Dedee d'Anvers was directed by her first husband Yves Allegret and she went on to feature in such classic titles as La Ronde Casque d'Or Les Diaboliques Armee des Ombres and the English film Room At The Top a performance which netted her the very first Best Actress Oscar awarded to a nonAmerican actress. These then were the dual backgrounds and experience that these great actors brought to Le Chat and once again I find myself reporting on a film in the wake of other raves and once again I am both pleased and honored to add my voice to those others. As a Case History of a relationship that has soured to the point of bitterness and virtually no communication this movie hits every target at which it aims. There are long stretches at the beginning where we have only nonverbal acting of the highest order to tell us  and I use that word deliberately rather than 'show'  what is going on what has GONE on and what WILL be the inevitable conclusion. Monitoring the emptiness the hollowness the bitterness of this relationship it's almost impossible  despite subtle reminders  to imagine that these people had once loved each other so much that they had chosen to spend their lives together. Now inexplicably and unobtrusively that love has disintegrated til Julien Gabin loves only his cat Greffier whilst Signoret still yearns wistfully for the love that has been lost. Most of the other comments here speak of depression sadness and other negatives yet I did not find it so. True there is little or nothing uplifting about such a story  especially so since the neighboring buildings are being pulled down around them and in yet another metaphor their house is shown in earlier times to form a natural culdesac at rightangles to the others  but Great Acting will always transcend melodramatic emotion and screen Acting doesn't come Greater than this. Brilliant.";

Jean Gabin  Simone Signoret are a married couple whose relationship has outlasted their love for one another.

Signoret a onetime acrobat injured years earlier  now saddled with a permanent limp exacts a terrible revenge on both Gabin and his cat. GranierDeferre peppers the film with a fair amount of symbolism but it's never muddy. It's quite clear that the decline of Gabin's and Signoret's relationship coincides with the gentrification of their neighborhood. Their house is the last on the block slated for demolition.

	schema:headline " The Cat of Wrath...";
	schema:reviewBody "Never had silence been as eloquent as in the first act of The Cat. Most of the exchanges consist on severe glares desperate stares and a few thrown written notes but there's a reason why nothing much is said we don't need words to feel for the characters nor to understand their opposite needs and motives.So the minimalism is less an artistic license from director Pierre GranierDeferre than the authentic truetolife translation of marital boredom carried by two actors who didn't need dialogues to shine they had faces and what faces! With the solid and sensitive presence of veteran actor Jean Gabin and blueeyed Simone Signoret who at 49 looked ten years older the hardest part was over. Indeed seeing these two living monuments act react and sometimes interact was a soulhaunting spectacle by itself. Yet quoting Gabin starsystem was over even his presence of Signoret's wouldn't have been enough to justify a film if there wasn't some reasontobe.And that's The Cat's offering a powerful statement about marriage or the effect time has on the life of a former typewriter and an acrobat who had a limp from a youth accident. A few bucolic flashbacks contrasting with the bleak tone of the first act show a thenyouthful couple that made love on the grass after romantic motorcycle rides to finally surrender thirty years later to routine. It seems that whatever gave a spice to their life has turned sour and the house that was once looking onto a charming neighborhood became the sole survivor of urban expansion and soontobe destroyed by ominous bulldozers. The buildings' destruction is a leitmotif of powerful value it is not the house but the marriages' foundations that are obviously at stakes. In fact the whole film is full of metaphorical symbolism one that never feels forced as it is naturally inserted in the story starting with the titular animal. The cat is an ordinary alley cat not ugly but not exceptional either and as soon as Julien Bouin finds it it's literally love at first sight the animal becomes his provider and repository of feelings much to Lucienne's devastating jealousy. This is a woman abandoned by her husband they live in the same house share the same rooms but they live in separate lives the cat put the final nail in the coffin of their lost love that glee in Julien's eyes with the cat on his knees is one she'll never get and she can't resign herself.In fact she has nothing against the cat she even likes it but the poor animal reflects the heart nuisance the marriages turned to and will trigger the chain of events that will lead to the heartbreaking final act. The film is told in flashback and this is the right choice because it leaves most of the powerful moments near the end so that the cat doesn't steal the actors' thunder. It is just a cause but not an end the core of the film is the tragedy of a relationship that is so fragile that any blow can make it collapse but as the story moves forward we feel that the bigger tragedy is that it never does. Maybe divorces or separations have become such common practices that we can't understand why the two never envisioned that option it is even questioned in the film when Julien goes to his old mistress a brothel manager played by Annie Cordy. And these dialogues with the mistress are integral to the comprehension of Julien's mysterious personality he has such ugly words about his wife that the mistress doesn't understand why he doesn't leave her. Well the answer is in the question Julien can't prevent himself from talking about his wife she's the center of his thoughts as mean as they are at least they exist. Marriage seems like a plane in a storm he's aboard and can do nothing about it. But Lucienne needs love and in one of the film's emotional outbursts she says she wants a cat too to get her share of tenderness and then she starts meowing hysterically this is how desperate it is. Julien puts the final blow by commenting her awful looks when she's upset.But does he fool us? All through the film we suspect that his heart is not devoid of feelings the passion has just been diluted in the disillusion of time and boredom and he can't find a proper way to express it maybe he doesn't know it himself. The film doesn't really provide answers it just shows a reality that couples can relate to even I who's been married for five years contemplate a same sort of existential block sometimes and being younger than the couple is scarier because I wonder if the film can't work like a warning. But then again this is not just about marriage but the effect of times on relationships. Julien and Lucienne as old as they are used to have dreams and weren't just bluecollar workers so that life would be ahead of them after retirement they had interesting jobs and they had no kids. Future couldn't look gloomier.They say marriage is an institution well the film reminded me of this term coined in The Shawshank Redemption  being 'instutionalized' which means getting used to the very walls that used to scare us because time has a double effect it erodes relationships but also build our resistance to their erosion the tragedy of The Cat is that the effect is different from the husband to the wife but the greatness of the film lies in the final minutes and the way it toys with the sicknesses of the two leads that can be both summarized as 'heart' conditions.I'm not sure I'd feel ready to watch The Cat again but I know there will come a time if I grow old enough where I'll think about it again.".

However it is watchable if you like the main actors Jean Gabin and Simone Signoret which I do. Their performance  and the cat's  makes the film just about watchable. Jean Gabin and Simone Signoret's couple has been flagging for a while he does not love her any more and gives all his affection to this famous cat whilst SS is getting more and more irate....alors ce qui devait arriver arriva .... she shoots the cat ! The gloominess of the film is compounded by the fact that they live in a neighbourhood which is gradually being demolished day by day to make place for high rise blocks and their old house stands out like a sore thumb amongst the ruins. There is little human dialogue in the film  but Gabin does seek some solace from a neighbour lady friend  there is some slowmotion cat dancing on scaffolding and various futile attempts by Signoret to start conversation. In summary it is well acted these two are monstres sacrs from French cinema so I think the film is worth watching for their performance. If I am not mistaken it was made in the western Paris suburbs either near Colombes or the CourbevoiePuteaux area which has been transformed into La Dfense business complex. For this reason alone the film is an interesting record of a long demolished area of the Paris suburbs. Also on the positive side picture and sound quality are excellent.".

If you are into cheerleading you'll most likely enjoy it.  The acting is average the story is pretty weak but the cheering is very good.If you're a fan of Bring it On then watch this one just check your expectations at the door.  I rate it a 5 out of 10.".

At the same time she is falling for the shaggy Derrick who could be perfect for her.From the beginning this film annoyed me. The lead girl is too naive and impressionable  after one talk with her head cheerleader she decides to cut down on her calories and ridicule her friends  even drop them for acceptance. Don't most girls grow out of that by college? When she finally stands up for herself you'll wonder what took so long and why she felt the need to strip to make her point.The acting is okay at best especially from the lead who is out shined by the girls playing her best friend and her adversary. The comedy is minimal with the gag of Penelope getting hurt being very overdone. The ending was predictable and completely unrealistic as well.This film left me with a few questions What was with the constant costuming of Whittier in yellow? Why did the guy playing the mascot beat box to the costume head before going out onstage? Where did the new squad find the funding to get matching uniforms and how did they manage to unify their routine within two days? Overall This is nothing more than mundane teen drivel. It's an unnecessary sequel trying to cash in on the success of it's predecessor. The acting is poor and the ending unrealistic and predictable. Skip this lame flick  you're not missing anything.".

Maybe I'm biased because I'm from New Jersey but I've never heard any of my peers use the phrase Shut up!  Give me some characters and dialogue I can relate to for God's sake!  Enough of these Barbie and Ken Dolls!  Aside from the ultralame dialogue almost every gag falls flat.  And the stupid plot involves a couple of cheerleading outcasts training a ragtag team of students who know NOTHING about cheerleading in a limited amount of time! I'm not going to give away the outcome but the premise alone makes you want to puke right?  Bree Turner is a hot actress but she doesn't match up to Gabrielle Union.  And that Reese Witherspoon lookalike who plays the lead definitely doesn't match up to Kirsten Dunst!  Don't see this movie!  Just another lifeless sequel to serve as fodder for the video shelves. My score  3 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "It's hard to believe that any movie industry professionals were actually associated with straighttovideo production Bring It On Again 2004. Although a sequel it is more like a really painful blend of Revenge of the Nerds and Cadet Kelly. Despite the warnings I actually watched my soon to be regifted DVD. Anne JudsonYager who looks like Reese Witherspoon plus 30 pounds plays new college freshman and aspiring cheerleader Whittier Smith. She and her friend Monica Faune A. Chambers pass the audition and come under the scrutiny of sadistic head cheerleader Tina Hammersmith Bree Turner. They soon tire of life under Tina and form a rival cheerleading squad of fine arts students and campus radicals. Despite a host of available movie stereotypes the screenwriter can't seem to figure out how to portray this crowd and you actually feel embarrassed for the actors who must deal with these portions of her script. Production design style and unity are apparently unknown elements to director Damon Santostefano unsuccessfully seeking work since making this movie and the whole thing seems randomly thrown together. It must have been an assembly nightmare for the editor who may or may not share some of the blame it's hard to tell.I'm at somewhat of a loss as to the target demographic for Bring It On Again. These things tend to be pitched to producers for their sexploitation potential. And in this case they could at least count on a presold sexploitation audience of original Bring It On fans. But the only tie with the original is the subject of cheerleading and those looking for sexploitation elements will be disappointed. My guess is that the target audience is actually preteen girls. The script is certainly on that age and sophistication level. The male members of the cast appear to have been selected for their looks certainly not their acting skills while the female members are a dreary looking bunch although their limited acting skills are wellmatched with those of the male cast. When your leading lady looks like JudsonYager and your only really pretty actress is cast as the cheer squad's towel girl alarm bells should start sounding for those outside this target demographic. I bet the producers wish that they had heard those bells and monitored this project a little closer.Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.".

It is more of a comedy than the first movie and there is one big thing that ties it together with the first movie which I think most people have overlooked Both movies are saying that cheerleading is NOT COOL. Both movies are going out of their way to show that cheerleading is as shallow as anything can be and clearly pointing to a dozen other things that are far cooler but which happen not to be the focus of this particular comedy. That's actually pretty funny. These movies are not as emptyheaded as they first seem.The lead girl in the sequel first struck me as very boring in a girl next door type of way but I have to admit she grew into the part very well and achieved the confidence of character to come across as a convincingly cool cheerleader in the comedy setting I mean towards the end. Ultimately she was an actress rather than just a pretty face and that is to be commended considering that this was a mere straighttovideo release. Somebody in the production team actually had the ambition to create a quite serious wellwritten wellstructured piece of work  and they succeeded.I rated the first movie a 7 and this one surprisingly qualifies for as much as a 6 despite the ludicrous end performance apparently comprised by an almost entirely new team. It was fun. Quite an achievement all things considered.".

This just was like a copy of number one with a few differences.

This movie BRING IT ON AGAIN is the ANTIBring It On! It is joyless unfunny witless and unlike the talented stars of the original the stars in this turgid sequel have no personality whatsoever. There isn't a funny character scene or even moment in this movie.While the original was about high school cheerleaders the premise if you can call it that here is about college cheerleaders. What's weird is that in Bring It On the stars Kirsten Dunst Gabrielle Union Eliza Dushku were playing high schoolers but looked and acted older while here these supposed collegeage girls Andrea JudsonYager Bree Turner Faune Chambers could easily pass for high schoolers in both appearance and maturity level! The only real plus is when the 2 girls break off and form their own squad filled with those dormitory protesters. The movie started to get a little interesting but again the humor just wasn't there. But I will admit that the ending routine was fairly impressive. But kind of anticlimactic I would say. And that postmovie 80s song ending overlapping the scene goofs was not nearly as good as the one at the end of Bring It ON. Although I do prefer Pat Benatar to Toni Basil. But then again who doesn't?!".

	schema:reviewBody "Bring It On Again lacked the originality and flair of the first film. That's what it's problem was. It tried to be exactly like Bring It On and used the same format that the first movie used. The opening of both films were dream sequences of the main characters and something humiliating happening to them in the dream. Then both introduced us to the schools and the locations.

Then the build up to the big final showdown and then the ending where the underdog wins somehow. Even the credits tried to be the same with the bloopers and text style.That seems to be the major problem...the sequel tried too hard to be like the first film and didn't have the style or energy the first did. It trudged along trying it's hardest but lacked everything that made the first film great.The poorly written script lacking the vivacity and cattiness of the predecessor had no clever one liners or dialog. The direction was also terrible. There was no sense of personal style but it seems as if they gave first year filmmakers some low budget cameras and told them to make it look like the first film. The cinematography slightly resembled BIOs style but didn't have the flair that was introduced in the first.It seems Bring It On Again was made as a quickbuck scheme. It would've made much more money and would've been a much better film if they had most of the original cast signed on and a better script that could've placed the cast in a college or elsewhere and brought on the same collaborative team that helmed the first.Poor writing plus bad direction plus bad acting times unoriginality equals horrible straittovideo sequels.".

Although it did deplict some of the realities of university life the story line never went anywheres. The best part of the movie was the last 10 minutes when cheerleading actually took place.

The Goombas are no longer mushrooms but gigantic lizard men decked out in burgundy war regalia. Snyder embraces the industrial look of the film's reallife shooting locale with metal walkways dangling power cords and neon lighting curling around gray concrete pillars.

All of these settings are also draped in the fungus a stringcheeselike substance that occasionally offers powerups to the heroes including the iconic Bobomb. A fun score by Alan Silvestri adds another layer of cohesion.

I hadn't seen this movie in a while years found myself its IMDb page through the interwebs started reading reviews of it and thought this can't be that bad! So promptly set to watch it online and it was easy to find. I don't regret an instant of it I liked this movie more now as an adult than I did when I was a kid. Here's whyIt's like one of these marvel movies that have been coming out recently it's kind of cross between an adult's take and a children's take on a popular character. Some other reviewer or the trivia? had mentioned it It's right in the middle. And the writing is great. Each scene flows logically to the next and there's not much that's superfluous. Again it's got the fun of a children's movie mixed with the subtlety of an adult's movie. My greatest concern is why the Brooklyn girls aren't freaking out that they're in a parallel dimension. Sure when they find out Daisy is a princess they freak out but not about the fact that they're in a PARALLEL DIMENSION. I mean if you really pay attention to the movie and get into it just the visual aspects of this dystopian universe are worth it. You got smoke and sparks and wires and stretchy goo people fighting cars flipping sheer madness. You've got the goofball pair of bad guys. You got dancing. You've got a romance between Luigi and Daisy that movies 3x as fast as Romeo and Juliet. You've got Mario knowing everything there is to know about pipes including when to sled down them on a raft. You've got Yoshi and at first you're disappointed but then he turns out to be really cool. Did I mention King Koopa shooting flames out of a suspended bucket of coal? Think Bowser in Super Mario World and pay attention.A lot of people come away from the movie saying that was not a Mario movie and can't come up with reasons why except that it wasn't like the video game. I mean crap YOU try to write a script for Mario and make it compelling. Honestly there's not a lot to work with! Think about it. You got a guy and a kidnapped princess and an evil monster. Go write! But as much as the making of this of this film apparently sucked I think they did a great job with what materials they had. tldr This movie is fun and actually clever and I hope you watch it with an open mind!".

This movie was meant to entertain and captivate and it certainly does the trick.They took the classic game and adapted it to a fantasy reality that parallels our own and for that it was simply brilliant.

If you love the games and have an open minded imagination this is a must watch movie";

Some noticeable changes are in this film such as that the princess' name is Daisy and she's being held in a tower instead of a castle.  There's plenty of fungus and mushrooms around but I think that the storyline is actually improved from the game because if it were exactly like the game it would be just running round bashing blocks grabbing coins and eating mushrooms all the way which would eventually just become boring.  This film has variety like in a real world there are phone boxes houses restaurants and much more than just pipes flags and castles.  It just also happens that my favourite actor Bob Hoskins has the main role as Mario which makes this film more appealing and exciting.  There are also things from the Mario games in the film such as BobOmbs licensed by Reebok mysteriously and Goomba Shoes that are powered by Bullet Bills.  So to top it off this has to be one of the best films ever made and one of my alltime favourites.".

A lot of items and events IE sounds or what ever from the game show up and the story line makes sense as tho there could be a game that uses it from the Mario bros series. The brothers them self are well played and fit perfectly as you would think they would be. All in all its a good movie so ignore all the naysayers who try comparing it to the video game or what ever and put it down! Its definitely worth watching if you like comedy and Super Mario. And for those people that say it is a shame to a game that saved Nintendo you really should get your facts in order. After Super Mario was released for Nintendo Classic they were bankrupt. Mario was a good game but the system its self was missing a lot in all its other games and Mario did nothing to help. If you look into the history of Nintendo Final Fantasy which was going to be there last game hint the name There Final Fantasy saved the system and company not Mario. Its there face now but its just another game which happens to have a pretty good movie based off of it! Bye bye all!".

	schema:reviewBody "Super Mario Bros the Movie manages several wellknown things  firstly it's the first ever mainstream Video Game Movie adaption and secondly star Bob Hoskins has stated it as the worst film he's ever made.So how can I review this film so highly despite the main star's objections to the quality of it? The truth of the matter is that this film isn't as terrible as the hype states it is. Being the first Hollywood adaption of a video game series and being different from it's source material there wasn't really anything to compare it to. If you were hoping for a genuine conversion of the game's storyline into a movie then you are going to be highly disappointed  but then you've made a rather rash assumption that the basic story of the game series would work as a film to begin with. Movies need to be like epic events a major moment of the character's lives cataloged within an hour and a half minimum. The game's theme of 'Bowser has the Princess run into castle and have toad say Your Princess is in another castle 7 or 8 times before the end' doesn't make for a good film.Excuses aside the film does succeed in the way it intends to. It is extremely fun. Unlike other films with it's reputation the Super Mario Bros Movie is genuinely enjoyable and even more so thanks to the few downfalls in it's script. Bob Hoskins cracks me up as Mario Get Your Belt on Kid! We're going' in! and Dennis Hopper is clearly the inspiration for Doctor Evil from Austin Powers See you later Alligator. The movie manages to do something few films manage  it improves with age. I'm not going to state that it's as superb as Blade Runner As stated on the box because they're from two very different worlds. Blade Runner is a classic in terms of being a thoughtprovoking highcaliber scifi drama Super Mario is a classic in terms of being a cheesy funfueled thrillride. The only reason these two were compared in the first place was the similarity of a rundown ugly futuristic city both of which were furnished with surprisingly high quality set design and standards. I would love to see a full BluRay restoration of this movie because there is so much intricate work done on the backgrounds and in the details that the additional quality BluRay affords would allow us even more joy. There are some good jokes in here the pace is good and never slacks and while there are some bad script writing problems the enjoyment should allow most people to gloss over those issues without much problem Look at Star Trek 2009 horrific script plot holes and some truly terrible Hollywood writing but because it was so fun and full of action it is hailed as a great film. This makes it more closely related to being the Star Trek 09 movie of its day with special effects that were at the time really impressive and a mixture of family humor and more adult action Bob Hoskins sticking his face in a black woman's chest  golden.I would love to see a restored BluRay of this movie as it is a great fun movie. It is more fun than many more recent video game based movies The Resident Evil series is stale the Degeneration movie was missable the Final Fantasy films were badly directed they even got it wrong with Yakuza Like A Dragon... most are bland Something nobody could say about Super Mario Bros whether they like it or not or outright horrific especially if made by Uwe Boll. Super Mario Bros is not the best movie ever made but it never intended to be. It wasn't supposed to be a movie epic like Blade Runner or 2001 A Space Odyssey nor was it supposed to be a direct translation of the game which in itself would have been far worse and less enjoyable. It was intended to stand on its own two feet as a fun familyoriented action movie with darker scifi undertones and while it never accomplishes them to perfection it certainly succeeded well enough to continuously provide a fun and entertaining movie experience.Some ideas are quite cool others are a little childish but that tends to come with the territory with familyfriendly Hollywood movies. Again now more than ever Nintendo are familyoriented and their Wii console is centered around allowed the kids in as much as the teens and adults  another sign of this film being more accurate now than it was even at the time of its release.As for possible BluRay extras I would adore an audio commentary by Bob Hoskins with him just hating on the film. You can imagine that would be a funny commentary. The Raw Deal BluRay has an HD extra of a movie critic slating the movie. Heman DVDs have fancommentaries ragging on the quality of the episodes while still speaking fondly of the series they adore. If the extras on these don't harm the sales then the same thing for Super Mario Bros would only raise the sales of this film as people would be keen to hear what he has to say since his outbursts on the movie in the media. Other extras can include original script outlines and differences several deleted scenes and the possibility of a recut.I hope to see a decent BluRay release of this movie soon. They've got BluRay releases of Street Fighter Mortal Kombat and other video game movies of the era Super Mario deserves at least the same.".

Then again it would be kinda different having a short plumb guy dressed in overalls and a tall skinny guy dressed in green running around in dungeons and castles the whole time. I mean it would be a good idea for a cartoon movie but live action? Uh uh. No way. It was good to improvise for a live action film. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is much hated practically everywhere and of course I can understand why. Basically everyone from the '70's  80's and 90's generation grew up with playing Nintendo games and the Super Mario games in particular. However when one sees this movie it becomes pretty obvious early on that this movie has almost nothing to do with the Super Mario video games. The atmosphere settings and characters are totally different which is probably the main and also only reason why this movie was and still is hated among so many all over the world.However when one has to look at this movie with a fair and unbiased view one has to come to the conclusion that this movie is good decent entertainment. No it's not a GREAT movie but it does serve its purpose and that is to provide the viewer with 104 minutes of mindless simple entertainment.Kids will most likely like this movie best. The story is wonderfully adventurous and it all is very childishly simple constructed. I mean the story and setting all basically have very little to do with the games but when you just have to judge the story it's a pretty good and well thought out one. If the main characters were let's say some average Manhattan plumbers named the William's brothers and the entire movie wasn't based on a series of video games than perhaps the movie would had received a far better reception and would had entertained and reached a wider audience.All of the characters are pretty entertaining and work out well in the movie. This is probably mainly due to the well known cast. Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo are the Mario brothers and they form a pretty good main duo. Dennis Hopper also is in his element as the ruthless overthetop stereotyped villain King Koopa. He gives the movie a certain extra fun and flair. Other well known actors in the movie are Fiona Shaw Gianni Russo Carlo Rizzi from the first two The Godfather movies and Lance Henriksen in a very small cameo role.Unlike the games the movie is a dark one. All of the sets are dark which was perhaps not the greatest atmospheric mood for the story and the entire movie in general. All of the sets are disappointing small and unimaginative looking. Same goes for the costumes and most of the makeup effects. The movie however has some good and convincing looking early special effects. Remember folks that it was 1993 when this movie was released.The movie however is most of the time a bit too childishly told and the dialogs are below par and too simple.The pace and editing is good but the movie severely lacks some action and real interesting moments. At moments it takes too long before something good or interesting happens again which makes this movie perhaps a bit boring and uninteresting to watch at certain points.All in all it's a not very successful but still yet entertaining first attempt at making a movie based on a video game. Certainly better than some of those movies based on video games released this present day!610httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Nintendo my favorite company has betrayed me. Be then again they didn't know that the creators of this movie would defile the game that made Nintendo an extremely successful video game company. But enough of that let me tell you what is wrong with this movie everything.First off Super Mario Bros. the game takes place in the Mushroom Kingdom a happy place that has been taken over by King Koopa aka Bowser and its people forced to mindlessly obey his will. Mario has to of course defeat Bowser to bring peace back to the Mushroom Kingdom. We all know that. The game DID NOT have cars skyscrapers or any obvious technology we enjoy today. Mario was a natural high jumper and he worked alone.The movie however is just a lame action movie with a few Mario allusions thrown in to attract Nintendo fans. The Mario allusion consist solely of Mario Luigi and Daisy's names enemy names and a bombomb. Yay. Oh and Yoshi in a 5second cameo as a dinosaur too small to even consider riding on. But Mario can't jump no he's a Brooklyn plumber with a Columbian brother! How'd that happen?. Their personalities aren't even right. In the games Mario is a determined hero with a heart of gold willing to do anything to save the day. Luigi is his shy brother who helps Mario in any way he can but in a minimal sort of way. In the movie they act more like best friends than brothers Mario is annoyed by everything and Luigi has a temper.If you like plots quickly written up on napkins before the check comes and complete destruction of all that Mario stands for then see this movie. If you are under the age of 12 and have never played a Mario game in your life then proceed with caution. If you have EVER played a Mario game in your life take all measures NOT to see this movie. Remember you cannot sue if this movie totally makes you cry uncontrollably for many hours trust me I've tried.".

The Mario allusion consist solely of Mario Luigi and Daisy's names enemy names and a bombomb. Yay. Oh and Yoshi in a 5second cameo as a dinosaur too small to even consider riding on. But Mario can't jump no he's a Brooklyn plumber with a Columbian brother! How'd that happen?. Their personalities aren't even right. In the games Mario is a determined hero with a heart of gold willing to do anything to save the day. Luigi is his shy brother who helps Mario in any way he can but in a minimal sort of way. In the movie they act more like best friends than brothers Mario is annoyed by everything and Luigi has a temper.If you like plots quickly written up on napkins before the check comes and complete destruction of all that Mario stands for then see this movie. If you are under the age of 12 and have never played a Mario game in your life then proceed with caution. If you have EVER played a Mario game in your life take all measures NOT to see this movie. Remember you cannot sue if this movie totally makes you cry uncontrollably for many hours trust me I've tried.";

	schema:reviewBody "It was summer 1997. I was just becoming a video gamer then and when my Dad told me the Super Mario Bros Movie was on TV I nearly had a lapse of sanity I was like THERE'S A MOVIE?! And so I sat down and watched it. Then I rented it endlessly. After which my parents finally bought me a VHS copy for Christmas in winter of '98. I have studied this movie to no end I have watched it so many times I have lost count. But it's also not as bad as people make it out to be. Let's look at the facts.Mario is Italian right? Mario is from Brooklyn right?Well they got half that right getting a British actor Hoskins to play the part of Mario with a New York Accent. I thought that was OK but in the long run Mario should have been played by Danny DeVito. That's really the only person who could have played him because DeVito's both Italian AND a New Yorker at least he acts like it...Luigi is Italian right? Luigi is from Brooklyn right?Again something they got half right. John Leguizamo a young Hispanic man to play the part of an Italian Plumber. At least John acts like a New Yorker a convincing New Yorker nonetheless but not an Italian Plumber. Also Luigi should have had a mustache there's no excuse for him not having a mustache in that movie but for some reason... Koopa. Koopa is a dinosaur.Okay they totally blew this one but hey it was 1992 when they made the movie for Chrissake! There was no such thing as CGI back then and even if there had been we'd all complain to this day about 'How fake Bowser looked.' So they did the next best thing they made Koopa a really mean politician I can see the humor in that now...Daisy. Daisy is the Princess of Sarasaland.OK they blew this one too but here's the lowdown on Mario and the Princess I don't know if you know this but Mario doesn't go out with Peach in the games he goes out with Pauline the girl from Donkey Kong an earlier model for Peach. But now Pauline and Peach exist in the same plain so there is no reason to have Mario have a relationship with a young princess when it can go to Luigi a character that kids can relate to.Goombas. Goombas...Again there was no CGI back in those days and even if there was it was very primitive T2 and it could not have made the illusion of many little characters on screen. So they did the next best thing they had oversized God knows why zombielike creatures who had once been members of the Mushroom Kingdom act out they're part unfortunately probably taking a lot of the budget up...And Finally Toad. Toad Toad Toad...Toad is supposed to be a body guard of the princess right? Well he's Peach's body guard not Daisy's and he must have been out of a job or something in this movie because I have no idea why he was even in this film...I hope this helps you understand the Mario Bros Movie a little better. I like to think of it as Mario in Wario's World which would've made a cool sequel but again the movie bombed at the box office... I have now and always will enjoy this movie but the flaws are hard to look past. But if you can manage to watch the movie and just have fun then I salute you because it's Mario and everybody loves Mario no matter what they say.UPDATE After revisiting the world of the Mario Bros I came to realize what made me fall in love with this movie in the first place... I don't know why but I've always been attracted to this movie it will always hold a special place in my heart and it's number 2 on my top ten list With FIGHT CLUB being number 1. When I was little I watched this movie over and over and over again until three in the morning every weekend until my parents split up... The reason I love it so much isn't because it's about my favorite video game character or that it stars my favorite actors Bob Hoskins Dennis Hopper but because it's a gritty dark violent balls to the wall science fiction movie. Even with a PG rating this movie is PG13 by today's standards lol But I know everything about this movie. The only thing is I wish they'd come out with a special edition DVD with some special features it is the FIRST movie to be based upon a video game after all...All in all there are only 2 things I'd change about this wonderful little movie...1. Luigi would have a mustache. 2. Mario Bros would be in Mario Bros Red and Green Uniforms whole movie.That's all I have to say really I can't express what a fun and entertaining movie this is even if you don't think it's true to the video game which it is to a big extent still watch it and enjoy it as the most violent gritty PGRated Science Fiction Film ever made. I love you Mario Luigi your okay too.  Art At War".

Also the sights and sounds of Rio could have been a little more prominent in the movie. Much of the movie scenes were indoors. The girls performing in the memorable samba scenes were excellent however not long enough. Much more of the carnival carnaval scene should have been added to the movie. I will still rent this movie occasionally despite the old African religious scenes. All of the characters in the story were believable which is essential in any movie. It got kind of 'corny' when Regina stopped the music during the performance of the musical and made her statement about 'people forgetting how to love' but I forgave her due to the rest of her performance. I will watch it again.".

Also the sights and sounds of Rio could have been a little more prominent in the movie. Much of the movie scenes were indoors. The girls performing in the memorable samba scenes were excellent however not long enough. Much more of the carnival carnaval scene should have been added to the movie. I will still rent this movie occasionally despite the old African religious scenes. All of the characters in the story were believable which is essential in any movie. It got kind of 'corny' when Regina stopped the music during the performance of the musical and made her statement about 'people forgetting how to love' but I forgave her due to the rest of her performance. I will watch it again.";

	schema:headline " Delightful German Comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "Kautner's film adaptation of Curt Goetz's play is one of the most delightful comedies to emerge from Germany in the quiet decades of the 1950s and 1960s.A morality tale it tells of how a coldhearted professor makes a pariah of his black sheep sister who flees to Uruguay. Eventually she dies leaving him a house there that may or may not be a brothel. Unfortunately the luxurious residence will only be his if his daughter first gives birth out of wedlock.The film has a light breezy style and makes much fun of social and moral conventions. It is particularly interesting to see as a period piece at the dawn of the sexual revolution in the western world. Of course German Lutheranism has none of the prudishness or puritanism that infected Christianity in the Englishspeaking world so the culture of that country was comfortable tackling this material. It is hard to imagine this film coming out in England the United States or Australia during that time period.Despite this there is absolutely no explicit material in the film just some sly innuendo and good coming timing.The professor's family at home provide a delightful supporting cast Ruth Leuwerik providing the film with a moral centre as the warm maternal mother caring for her brood of bespectacled children and doing her best to restrain her uptight arrogant husband.Ilsa Page performs well as the oldest daughter and creates a suitably likable heroine figure.The house itself is a wonderfullyrealised set and represents both a utopian ideal and the shallow materialism encouraged by a consumer society. The professor for all of his disciplinary attitude and attempts to regiment his family is ultimately a corruptible hypocrite and it is tempting to read him as a political figure perhaps even as Hitler. For all of his power authority and supposed leadership skills he is shown to have no substance and be easily corrupted and out for material gain to the extent where he will sell his own family members.In such a reading the ostracised person could be one of Hitler's opponents. The person he persecuted and expelled now has a posthumous upperhand as he secretly covets the fruits of her debauched lifestyle.A feminist reading of the film is also interesting. To the father his daughter's reputation is also a commodity to be traded in exchange for a more valuable commodity the house.Montevideo on the other side of the world is where traditional moral structures are inverted. Temporarily estranged from Germany society and the bonds of family the professor undermines his own hollow moral code. Like a colonist he thinks he is free from the watching eyes of society to do what he likes in this frontier land.Ultimately this is a comedy about hypocrisy and the failings of an insular arrogant academic and the way in which puritanism as a moral code causes more harm than good to family relationships. In that sense the themes of the film are still pertinent today and it is sad that it is not more widelyknown in the Englishspeaking world.".

Wonderful acting by Ruehmann when he tries to get the idea across to the fianc of his daughter never directly speaking but rather using incredibly funny metaphors.

It was adapted from a novel and probably the scriptwriters including Reeves were too respectful of the original written as told by other reviewer by a specialist in western novels and took little advantage of the European western film craze of the 1960s. Even in the more serious western dramas as Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West there were always bizarre elements and even a bit of Brechtian estrangement making it obvious that it was a foreign concoction turning a classic genre upside down every now and then revealing something that had not been told in the classic American westerns although I believe the real revisionist westerns were made by American filmmakers as Penn Peckinpah Altman and Gries. This one plays it straight and maybe Reeves wanted to do a real western but it just comes out as an average European western without zest.".

	schema:headline " Steve Reeves' unique Spaghetti Western about a revenger against cruel bandits";
	schema:reviewBody "Pleasant Spaghetti Western with a Peplum usual  Steve Reeves  as starring and writer . An Italian production full of action  exaggerated characters shootouts and lots of violence . This is the story of a man with an only obsession Live for kill . For money for pleasure for revenge  he doesn't care why he kills or how  ... Some rustlers rob horses from Sturges family . The oldest son named Mike Steve Reeves  Sturges homage to John Sturges ? and his brother Roy set out in pursuit the thieves . While they are looking for the outlaws Mike sees as the Southern Pacific Railways blows up and they are accused for robbing the cash  being framed by a corrupt sheriff Dick Palmer  aka Mimmo Palmara  who executes a Pestaggio against Mike as hitting  punch and kicking . They are incarcerated in Yuma Penitentiary . There Roy doesn't bear the mistreats and humiliations  but Mike gets to getaway and seeks vendetta against nasties . He escapes and sees the atrocity over his family and the Sturges ranch is destroyed  then executes a singlehandedly revenge as he slashes ravages and murders each person involved in the killing . Mike encounters hints about the bandits in Dragon Pass Coach Station and a box of Niagara dynamite  plus an Abisian Desert Companion bottle  all of them lead his enemies. Mike is relentless in his vendetta  deadly in his violence. The conflict is a simple one between avenger Mike Sturges  and oppressors nasties bandits commanded by cruel sheriff and his underlings. Then Sturges is submitted a tempestuous trap and is caught and he faces the vicious bandits. Finally  in a coach station takes place a deadly showdown between Mike and his enemies .It's an exciting western all'Italiana with breathtaking showdown between the protagonist Steve Reeves against the heartless Dick Palmer and his merciless gunfighters . Steve is fine he runs  ravages the screen shoots hit and run and kills but also receives violent knocks  punches  kicks and wounds . In the film premiere attained bit success  nowadays is best valued and I think it turns out to be an acceptable Spaghetti Western. Steve Reeves played Hercules and Hercules and Hercules and Queen of Lydia and many others musclemen epics . He also acted in adventure genre as Sandokan swashbuckling as Morgan the pirate and fantasy as The thief of Bagdag . Reeves was almost retired when starred and wrote  Viovo per la tua morte unfortunately for Mr. Universe the picture was a failure . His riding scenes were usually carried out by the habitual stunt and double Giovanni Cianfriglia or Ken Wood . Frustrated Steve Reeves returned US and nothing more else  as he retired in his ranch . The secondary Nello Pazzafini as a cruelly warden role is terrific  he bears a hysterical and mocking smile  subsequently the would play similar characters .In the picture appears ordinary secondaries from Spaghetti as Gino Lollobrigida or Lee Burton  Gina Lollobrigida's brother  Ivan Scratuglia  Franco Fantasia  Enzo Fiermonte  Spartaco Conversi  and the Eurotrash goddess Rosalba Neri  and also uncredited Aldo Sambrell as a brutal bounty hunter . The film packs violence  gunplay  explosion high bodycount and it's fast moving and quite entertaining. There is plenty of action in the movie  guaranteeing some shootouts or stunts every few minutes. There are many fine technicians and nice assistants as Remo De Angelis  habitual master of arms and stunts in numerous Spaghetti Western . Good production design creating an excellent scenario with luminous outdoors  dirty and rocky landscapes under a glimmer sun and a fine set on the town . The musician Carlo Savina composes a nice soundtrack and well conducted  it's full of guttural sounds sensible songs and a haunting musical leitmotif . Catching song at the beginning and ending titled Go West young man by Powell and Savina . Striking cinematography by Enzo Barboni  Trinity and Bambino film's director with negative well processed and perfect remastering . Interior filmed at Elios Studios and outdoor sequences filmed in Spanish outdoors located in Almeria  Spain.Camilo Bazzoni's direction under a pseudonym named Alex Burks  an usual cameraman is middlingly crafted  here he's less thoughtprovoking and broody and more inclined toward violence and too much action  though he's an expert on cinematography . Rating  5 acceptable and passable . The picture will appeal to Spaghetti Western fans.".

Reeves makes a good western hero losing his shirt at times to give us a glimpse of his splendid physique at age 42 he was still in great shape and spends lots of his screen time running jumping engaging in fist fights and carrying on like a much younger man. The film's depiction of Yuma Territorial Prison is good also replicating the feel of the prison remarkably well. A very minor knock is that the pistols are of the John Woo variety shooting fifteen or sixteen times as needed particularly noticeable in the prison break. The music by Carlo Savina is outstanding but that's as usual for this genre. A lesser gem in a nice package from Wild East including an interview with Mimmo Palmera.".

The way he acted in a cowboy movie was surprisingly good and he could turn out to be a lot better if he further his career. It's too bad he quit earlier..I wish he acted more in spaghetti western movies..he could be as popular as Franco Nero or Lee Van Cleef! A Long Ride From Hell is just one of the best western movies i have seen so far. In my opinion this one surpasses Django and The Great Silence.

By some standards this movie might even be labeled minimalist!There is one missed opportunity however. Reeves spends an entire reel laboring on a rock pile in one of those primitive scorchinghot desert prisons manned by sadistic guards who are quick to dish out brutal punishments. One is reminded of Hellgate or There Was a Crooked Man. He sometimes works with his shirt off  giving us a look at that glorious suntanned sweatstreaked torso  and he's sometimes given a punch or a kick or a shove. However there's no scene of Reeves being tied to a post and given a savage flogging across his bare back.

	schema:headline " The Last Ride of Steve Reeves";
	schema:reviewBody "Peplum bodybuilding sensation Steve Reeves of Hercules fame concluded his cinematic career with Suicide Commandos director Camilla Bazzoni's A Long Ride From Hell a thoroughly conventional but wholly cynical Spaghetti western penned by Reeves and coscenarist Roberto Natale of Kill Baby... Kill! from veteran American western novelist Gordon D. Shirreffs' book The Judas Gun. Lensed on location in Spain by future Trinity helmer Enzo Barboni A Long Ride from Hell is a visual treat especially the nocturnal scenes. Unfortunately Bazzoni lacks an eye for pictorial detail and composition. This lowbudget oater looks like it was shot very quickly and the writers eliminated certain scenes like a courthouse scene to accelerate the pace. Bazzoni doesn't stage the shootouts with any sense of verve like either Sergio Leone or Gianfranco Parolini. Carlo Savina's music sounds like a leftover score from his sword and sandal features but the theme song is rather catchy. Mind you Steve Reeves looks like he was born to wear a sixgun and Stetson but cleanshaven as he remains throughout the film he never looks like a traditional Spaghetti western protagonist. Meanwhile mustached Wade Preston makes an evil adversary with Spaghetti western stalwart Aldo Sambrell of Navajo Joe fleshing out the cast of this 85 minute horse opera.Cast as rancher Mike Sturges Steve Reeves learns that his herd of horses have been stolen and most of his riders killed. Tracy survives the ambush and makes it back to alert Mike about the theft of horseflesh. Mike rides out with his kid brother Roy Franco Fantasia of Hercules Samson  Ulysses and their ranch hand Bobcat Bates Mario Maranzana of The Nephews of Zorro to recover the stolen horses because they have their fortune tied up in them. They ride to the farthest water hole at Dragoon Springs and camp. During the night a stranger enters their camp. Mike recognizes Marlin Mayner Wade Preston of A Man Called Sledge and Marlin warns them that they are sleeping on the right of way of the Southern Pacific Railroad. Marlin lies that he serves as a Southern Pacific investigator. He explains to Mike that the railroad is uneasy with drifters encroaching on it land since several robberies have occurred. Moreover he points out to Mike that the exconvict turn ranch hand Bobcat Bates would arose the suspicions of any lawman. As it turns out Marlin was the dastard that arranged the ambush of Mike's horse herd but Mike doesn't know this at this point. After Marlin leaves Mike rides out to investigate. An unknown assailants floats a lariat over Mike's head pulls him off his horse and shoots him in the leg.Meanwhile the Southern Pacific train pulls up the water tower at night to replenish the boiler of the locomotive. Marlin's outlaws open fire and pour a barrage of lead into the train. They wipe out all the guards and then dynamite the boxcar containing the loot. They make off with 80thousand in gold coin. The authorities Sheriff Max Freeman Mimmo Palmara of Bullets Don't Argue arrive not long afterward and question Mike about the robbery. Savagely he tries to beat any information out of Mike. As it turns out the evidence is incriminating because Bobcat's dead body has been found near the railroad tracks. Later despite a courtroom scene that was never shot Mike and his brother Roy wind up in the infamous Yuma Prison. The scenes showing Mike smashing rocks in a quarry is the first time that Reeves bares his Mr. Universe chest. An evil Prison supervisor tortures Roy and kills him. Mike takes advantage of a prison riot to break out of Yuma. Eventually he tracks down the villains wipes them out and returns the 80thousand that Marlin had buried in a safe place.A Long Ride from Hell is nothing special and only the combined star power of Reeves and Preston make it worth watching.".

Bazzoni doesn't stage the shootouts with any sense of verve like either Sergio Leone or Gianfranco Parolini. Carlo Savina's music sounds like a leftover score from his sword and sandal features but the theme song is rather catchy. Mind you Steve Reeves looks like he was born to wear a sixgun and Stetson but cleanshaven as he remains throughout the film he never looks like a traditional Spaghetti western protagonist. Meanwhile mustached Wade Preston makes an evil adversary with Spaghetti western stalwart Aldo Sambrell of Navajo Joe fleshing out the cast of this 85 minute horse opera.Cast as rancher Mike Sturges Steve Reeves learns that his herd of horses have been stolen and most of his riders killed. Tracy survives the ambush and makes it back to alert Mike about the theft of horseflesh. Mike rides out with his kid brother Roy Franco Fantasia of Hercules Samson  Ulysses and their ranch hand Bobcat Bates Mario Maranzana of The Nephews of Zorro to recover the stolen horses because they have their fortune tied up in them. They ride to the farthest water hole at Dragoon Springs and camp. During the night a stranger enters their camp. Mike recognizes Marlin Mayner Wade Preston of A Man Called Sledge and Marlin warns them that they are sleeping on the right of way of the Southern Pacific Railroad. Marlin lies that he serves as a Southern Pacific investigator. He explains to Mike that the railroad is uneasy with drifters encroaching on it land since several robberies have occurred. Moreover he points out to Mike that the exconvict turn ranch hand Bobcat Bates would arose the suspicions of any lawman. As it turns out Marlin was the dastard that arranged the ambush of Mike's horse herd but Mike doesn't know this at this point. After Marlin leaves Mike rides out to investigate. An unknown assailants floats a lariat over Mike's head pulls him off his horse and shoots him in the leg.Meanwhile the Southern Pacific train pulls up the water tower at night to replenish the boiler of the locomotive. Marlin's outlaws open fire and pour a barrage of lead into the train. They wipe out all the guards and then dynamite the boxcar containing the loot. They make off with 80thousand in gold coin. The authorities Sheriff Max Freeman Mimmo Palmara of Bullets Don't Argue arrive not long afterward and question Mike about the robbery. Savagely he tries to beat any information out of Mike. As it turns out the evidence is incriminating because Bobcat's dead body has been found near the railroad tracks. Later despite a courtroom scene that was never shot Mike and his brother Roy wind up in the infamous Yuma Prison. The scenes showing Mike smashing rocks in a quarry is the first time that Reeves bares his Mr. Universe chest. An evil Prison supervisor tortures Roy and kills him. Mike takes advantage of a prison riot to break out of Yuma. Eventually he tracks down the villains wipes them out and returns the 80thousand that Marlin had buried in a safe place.A Long Ride from Hell is nothing special and only the combined star power of Reeves and Preston make it worth watching.";

Further exploration discovers a strange living amoebalike organism and a damaged supergravity beam weapon aimed toward earth.  Many members of the crew are lost and the ship is eventually deflected back to earth by the accidental discharge of the gravity beam.The movie IS choppy without a doubt because the American distributor Crown International cut the film by over one half hour.  I'd certainly LOVE to see the excised footage however since the film is East German  I doubt if a complete print still exists.

	schema:reviewBody "The amazing imaginative fiction author Stanislaw Lem wrote this visually stunning East German space exploration film with a dated but still thoughtful message. The Sets of Der Schweigende Stern are detailed and beautiful  giving the film an amazingly alien feel. The cinematography varies from excellent to mediocre and the visual effects are cleverly done  relying on actual props and set devices as opposed to split screen and blue or green screen trick photography. Lem's plot is poignant and wellpaced but unfortunately most of the acting in this film is a bit difficult to watch. Finally the overuse of voiceover narration in the early part of the film detracts from its otherwise good artistic and technical merit.The story begins with the discovery that in 1908 an extraterrestrial space vehicle crash landed on earth. An electronic recording from the ship is recovered and linguists set about trying to decode its message. An international team of scientists astronauts and engineers who are scheduled to undertake a manned flight to Mars are then diverted to Venus to make contact with the Venusians. On the way they decipher the electronic cosmic document and learn that the Venusians were planning to attack the earth using nuclear warheads. To venture further in the plot would involve spoilers.This is a film full of mysteries and a film of its time  near the height if the cold war. A powerful point concerning the proliferation of nuclear arms is well made in this film though it is perhaps the only truly predictable aspect of the plot. Lem's plot heavy brand of highly imaginative science fiction is very dense reading and often carries similar ethical messages but rarely translates well into visual media. This is a worthy effort maintaining the slightly wild and surreal feel of Lem's aesthetics and yet driving forward the film's plot at an entertaining pace.Recommended for Lem fans serious scifi film fans and those interested in the connection between film and the social history of ideas. Unfortunately for Der Schweigende Stern the average movie fan won't be able to handle this one.".

It was written by Stanislaw Lem and is therefore quite interesting shocking and full of suspense  another aspect I wouldn't have expected to get in a film like that. Of course the acting is stiff dialogues are reduced to a necessary minimum and the romantic element in the plot is too weak to be convincing. Probably the screenwriters have removed most of the depth of Lem's original novel. Nevertheless the whole film manages to evoke Kubrickesque feelings at times note that it was made before 2001 A Space Odyssey! and serves as an interesting historical document but also as good scifi fun on a Sunday afternoon.".

	schema:reviewBody "Since this movie was covered fairly early on by the MST3000 crew along with Rocketship XM and King Dinosaur my initial perception of this movie was something on the lines of 'Ehhhh pretty cheesy' although it was clearly one of the better films they covered. Undoubtedly I saw the chopped up 93 minute version instead of the longer more coherent original version mentioned by other reviewers. However I saw a standalone DVD edition on sale at a clearance store and picked it up for a couple of bucks on some obscure impulse and one fine evening I gave it a spin. You know...in spite of the dated message and foreign cultural references and the problematic dubbing and Engrish translations 1st Spaceship To Venus does have a certain quality about it that I've come to respect. There's a certain gravity and solemnity to the proceedings. There's a certain wildness and inventiveness to the art direction and the sound design. And while none of the actors here are going to win any awards or even by remembered by American audiences if you pay attention you will see humane approachable performances undercut by poor dubbing that make the film much more watchable than glib junk like Rocketship XM or space flight oriented stuff out of the Roger Corman sausage factory. When I first saw 1st Spaceship I had the impression that it definitely had an East European vibe to it and the only Slavic speculative fiction author I was familiar with was Stanislaw Lem whose best known work is probably Solaris although my favorite piece is Non Serviam. Sure enough this movie turns out to be based on a Lem piece from decades back. Lem's dispassionate Kabbalistic voice and speech rhythms and his gift for oddly moving plots and characters somehow survived the adaptation to film and the tiny budget and the Engrish translation leaving a dignity and substance to the proceedings that many contemporary American sci fi flicks can't match. No this will never be anyone's first choice for a space opera shootemup but under the crappy dubbing and hackedup editing the sympathetic eye can see that there is some good work being done here. A good item to add to the collection of the sci fi completist and archivist.".

There's a certain gravity and solemnity to the proceedings. There's a certain wildness and inventiveness to the art direction and the sound design. And while none of the actors here are going to win any awards or even by remembered by American audiences if you pay attention you will see humane approachable performances undercut by poor dubbing that make the film much more watchable than glib junk like Rocketship XM or space flight oriented stuff out of the Roger Corman sausage factory. When I first saw 1st Spaceship I had the impression that it definitely had an East European vibe to it and the only Slavic speculative fiction author I was familiar with was Stanislaw Lem whose best known work is probably Solaris although my favorite piece is Non Serviam. Sure enough this movie turns out to be based on a Lem piece from decades back. Lem's dispassionate Kabbalistic voice and speech rhythms and his gift for oddly moving plots and characters somehow survived the adaptation to film and the tiny budget and the Engrish translation leaving a dignity and substance to the proceedings that many contemporary American sci fi flicks can't match. No this will never be anyone's first choice for a space opera shootemup but under the crappy dubbing and hackedup editing the sympathetic eye can see that there is some good work being done here. A good item to add to the collection of the sci fi completist and archivist.";

This may be the first space film from that country since 1929 but there were other films from Germany that would be considered science fiction.

	schema:reviewBody "When this movie was being made  1960  there was an attempt to make a fairly decent film. Discerning individuals will pick this up right away. There wasn't a astronomical amount of money being spent to create this slightly tarnished gem but that which was available appears to have used quite efficiently. The costuming and the sets are essentially not bad. The casting was a bit of a surprise. Star Trek likes to tout their use of multiple ethnicities in their cast commanding significant roles. This movie predates them by over half a decade. I wonder whether Roddenberry didn't use this movie as a partial inspiration? On the other hand this movie isn't a U.S. product so that may account for much of the laxity. Meanwhile the story while not on a razor's edge by today's standards must have been topnotch scifi a nod to Forry Ackerman here in 1960. The story is a good and still credible idea that would hold together well today if remakes are in order. There are the obvious science blunders in the script 'meteorites' being used when 'meteors' is more accurate  'asteroids' would probably be even more accurate but these flaws don't damage the final presentation. The premise is simple enough. We find an artifact on Earth and somehow determine it came from Venus. It is discovered to contain a message of destruction for our planet and we decide to go to Venus and see if we can prevent the promised Venusian attack. What awaits on the Venus is the point of this movie. The Venus sets though inexpensive are handled nicely through lighting forced perspective some matte work superb direction and editing etc. It seems to work and the effect is frequently nightmarish. There is a message buried in the story which is obvious and as noted not unknown in today's scifi goulash but it doesn't hit you over the head. It has its say and comes to an end as they return to Earth whether they like it or not. I believe this movie deserves better than the dismal rating given by those who have already voted. The story alone is worthwhile and the fact that an attempt was made to create a good movie despite finances is worth a 6. I was reminded of 'Forbidden Planet' when watching this. Another movie which also had a decent script as well as a better budget. One thing I will opine is that the sound effects were better in this movie than 'FP'.".

	schema:headline " Superb Science Fiction Tale Written by Lem";
	schema:reviewBody "Der schweigende Stern First Spaceship on Venus is a superb science fiction film produced behind the Iron Curtain at the height of the Cold War. Fortunately communist ideology does not feature prominently in the film though no doubt the producers were keen to create something that would rival  and exceed  the Hollywood films of the era. In this they succeeded.With a screenplay written by no less a science fiction luminary than the great Polish author Stanislaw Lem the film is relatively realistic in its depiction of space flight giving it a grittiness that the frequently camp offerings from the United States all too often lack.The set of the rocket ship's interior feels far more realistic than the garishlypainted plywood sets that would feature in Star Trek in just a few years' time.Likewise the rocket's exterior model is strikingly stylised giving it a unique appearance.The early realism gives way to a kind of surrealist feel when the ship lands on Venus. Special effects are used to good effect to create an atmospheric thoroughly alien world of mists and sinkholes.In contrast to Lem's later Solyaris the alien culture encountered here is comprehensible to humans. A paradox is presented in that the alien artifacts indicate that they were significantly more advanced on a scientific level yet still retain the aggressive warlike tendencies that the humans in this utopian tale have left behind.Indeed the film follows the wellworn but still valid path of warning that our moral development has not kept pace with our scientific achievements. Here the Venusians intent on invading Earth have unwittingly inflicted a nuclear apocalypse upon themselves.The cry for peace and nuclear disarmament gives this film its timeless appeal. Also of interest is the fact that the rocket from earth consists of an international crew working in harmony. Again this predates the ideas in Star Trek by several years and there seems to be a greater emphasis on true egalitarianism in this film there is no American captain lording it over his crew which did so much to undermine Trek's message. Unfortunately despite these good intentions much more character development is needed as one feels little sympathy for the crew. They are all largely interchangeable characters.Unfortunately the film does have weaknesses both technical and in terms of plotting. The film stock is of poor quality the camera work quite static and some of the acting is wooden. There are no bravura moments from the director it is all very workmanlike.Furthermore some cringeworthy moments do creep in despite the overall feel of gritty realism. For instance the ship's scientist gives the robot a heart within moments by simply plugging a few wires into the machine. The fact that the archive recordings are stored in robotic insects is never explained nor is the gravity repulsor that pushes the rocket away from the planet at the end.Depending on one's view the revelation that the alien mud is in fact energy that has been converted back into matter is either very clever or ludicrous.Pacing is a little problematic at times with the momentous nature of the discovery that the Tunguskan artifact is in fact Venusian in origin being very rushed.In summary despite its problems this film is far superior to virtually all Hollywood science fiction chiefly due to its realistic portrayal of space flight grittiness and atmosphere.Its attempt to portray a utopian future in which all nationalities can work in harmony is a heartfelt one at the height of the Cold War.Its message of peace is also timeless and means this film is as relevant today as ever.Without doubt then this is one of the greatest science fiction films and one that is sadly overlooked in favour of lesser offerings from the West.".

	onyx:emotionText "Der schweigende Stern First Spaceship on Venus is a superb science fiction film produced behind the Iron Curtain at the height of the Cold War. Fortunately communist ideology does not feature prominently in the film though no doubt the producers were keen to create something that would rival  and exceed  the Hollywood films of the era. In this they succeeded.With a screenplay written by no less a science fiction luminary than the great Polish author Stanislaw Lem the film is relatively realistic in its depiction of space flight giving it a grittiness that the frequently camp offerings from the United States all too often lack.The set of the rocket ship's interior feels far more realistic than the garishlypainted plywood sets that would feature in Star Trek in just a few years' time.Likewise the rocket's exterior model is strikingly stylised giving it a unique appearance.The early realism gives way to a kind of surrealist feel when the ship lands on Venus. Special effects are used to good effect to create an atmospheric thoroughly alien world of mists and sinkholes.In contrast to Lem's later Solyaris the alien culture encountered here is comprehensible to humans. A paradox is presented in that the alien artifacts indicate that they were significantly more advanced on a scientific level yet still retain the aggressive warlike tendencies that the humans in this utopian tale have left behind.Indeed the film follows the wellworn but still valid path of warning that our moral development has not kept pace with our scientific achievements. Here the Venusians intent on invading Earth have unwittingly inflicted a nuclear apocalypse upon themselves.The cry for peace and nuclear disarmament gives this film its timeless appeal. Also of interest is the fact that the rocket from earth consists of an international crew working in harmony. Again this predates the ideas in Star Trek by several years and there seems to be a greater emphasis on true egalitarianism in this film there is no American captain lording it over his crew which did so much to undermine Trek's message. Unfortunately despite these good intentions much more character development is needed as one feels little sympathy for the crew. They are all largely interchangeable characters.Unfortunately the film does have weaknesses both technical and in terms of plotting. The film stock is of poor quality the camera work quite static and some of the acting is wooden. There are no bravura moments from the director it is all very workmanlike.Furthermore some cringeworthy moments do creep in despite the overall feel of gritty realism. For instance the ship's scientist gives the robot a heart within moments by simply plugging a few wires into the machine. The fact that the archive recordings are stored in robotic insects is never explained nor is the gravity repulsor that pushes the rocket away from the planet at the end.Depending on one's view the revelation that the alien mud is in fact energy that has been converted back into matter is either very clever or ludicrous.Pacing is a little problematic at times with the momentous nature of the discovery that the Tunguskan artifact is in fact Venusian in origin being very rushed.In summary despite its problems this film is far superior to virtually all Hollywood science fiction chiefly due to its realistic portrayal of space flight grittiness and atmosphere.Its attempt to portray a utopian future in which all nationalities can work in harmony is a heartfelt one at the height of the Cold War.Its message of peace is also timeless and means this film is as relevant today as ever.Without doubt then this is one of the greatest science fiction films and one that is sadly overlooked in favour of lesser offerings from the West.";

	schema:reviewBody "No space monsters no death rays no strange alien beings. Perhaps I've been conditioned by too many cheesy scifi and horror films of the 195060's era but First Spaceship on Venus is simply so boring that it overrides the few inventive elements that it otherwise contains.There is one humorous idea though that stands out. Filmed in 1960 the story takes place in the way distant future of 1985 when an extraterrestrial spool is discovered in the Gobi Desert area of Siberia. Voiceover narration states that a connection has been made between the alien artifact and a meteor explosion that took place there in 1908 some seventy eight years earlier. On the spaceflight to Venus in the Cosmostrater 1 world renowned scientists have made a breakthrough regarding the spool's information  the Venusians have targeted Earth for conquest and intend to decimate the planet's population. Frantic to warn Earth the scientists are frustrated in their inability to break through space interference to get their warning heard. Now in thinking about this and piecing together information from the film that places the Earth to Venus trip at about thirty one days my question would be  What's the rush? The communication is almost eighty years old wouldn't they have gotten around to it by now? The reason the Venusians haven't gotten around to it is because their own advanced technology had already done them in. Landing on Venus the exploratory force runs into nothing more ominous than metallic insects and black lavalike attacking ooze but nothing else! Though the astronauts have set a destruct sequence into effect they quickly find a counter measure that reverses it. One almost begs for a big goofy alien like the one from The Phantom Planet to appear to lighten things up a bit.On the flip side the movie assembles an impressive though no name international cast including Asians a black a Russian and a German. Seven men and one woman from the scientific community form the astronaut team though why Sumiko is given a bright red jumpsuit to wear instead of the same color as the men is intriguing. She's also portrayed as the most human of the team suggesting a heart for the robot that continuously beats Professor Orloff at chess.I guess my main problem with the film is that it takes itself way too seriously. The constant narration in the first half of the film seems to neglect the players instead of letting them move the story along through their own interaction. With no comic relief to counteract the monotony I found myself wanting this one to be over quick which it was at a seventy nine minute run time but it seemed much longer.".

Somehow There is an awful lot of unexplained Somehow in this film this is connected with a supposed meteor that hit Siberia 75 years before. Lots of International scientists are given access to the world's biggest computer and it is very big  must be lots and lots of vacuum tubes in there they manage to decipher some of the message  but not all. We must renovate it! cries one of the vaguely ethnic International Scientists We must soak it in a catalytic medium then subject it to radiation!Very good idea says another not bothering to ask why radiating a heatdamaged magnetic recording would do any good whatsoever. Though I must remember that trick next time I accidentally erase one of my answer machine messages.Meanwhile another scientist who has big shiny hair has worked out that the trajectory of the alien ship means it can only have been launched from Venus! How? I mean how DID he work that out 75 years after the event? Find some 100 year old Yak farmer who saw it crash and asked him which way it came from? As luck would have it the World League of Super Scientists have just finished building a pretty nifty looking space ship that not only looks like a Stark lemon squeezer but has Artificial Gravity a machine shop and a fully equipped operating theatre. Why after going to all that effort they didn't manage shoehorn in a small kitchen somewhere is beyond me but if they had the crew wouldn't have got to drink great Science Fiction Chocolate Flavoured Smoothies for the whole trip. Wow! The future is so exciting! The crew their cute robot and GASP! a woman doctor! blast off for Venus. Suddenly there is an unexpected meteor shower  didn't these people ever see any crappy old SF films?  there is ALWAYS a sudden unexpected meteor shower. One of the crew goes outside to fix something before they hit an even bigger slightly more expected meteor shower. He fixes it apparently by letting off a fireextinguisher in its general direction they swerve at the last moment and aren't doomed any more.This whole sequence is deathly dull. One of the most boring unexpected meteor shower scenes ever.After 45 days in space sick to the back teeth with chocolate smoothies and just three days away from Venus they decipher the rest of the message which basically says All your base are belong to us  Mwahahahaha! EEK! Dilemma! Go on? or go back and warn Earth?They grimly go on. One of the crew goes ahead to scout for a good landing site. He looses radio contact. He lands. He gets out to go for a walk and falls down a hole where he is attacked by metal insects. Note Attacked in this context means a Not Very Special Effects guy up a stepladder bounces some totally nonscary kid's toys on thin elastic in front of the camera. His scout ship explodes. The big ship nearly lands on top of him. Everyone meets up.Look your ship exploded because you parked it on top of that buried power cable.It didn't say anything about not parking near power cables in the manual. Who do I sue? They follow the power cable. It leads to a strange ginormous glowing ball.They follow it the other way. It leads to a strange ginormous underground control centre place  an entire planet to land on and they arrive at the Venusian's High command's secret underground bunker...! Nice one! Suddenly they are attacked by a bezzillion tons of malevolent black porridge which chases them up a spiral ramp. Trapped at the top one of them pulls out his disintegrator ray and fires. The porridge runs away but things start happening. Lightening flashes. The strange ginormous glowing ball turns red and gravity starts getting stronger! The spaceship can't take off! Everyone rushes back to the spaceship where they sit around and talk for ages. The cute robot goes berserk well rolls backwards and forwards a bit and God knows how manages somehow to seriously injure someone.The most Asian member of the crew remembers he caught a glimpse of a control panel down the bottom of a very deep hole back at the Secret Bunker and is convinced he can reverse the process. He sets off with the only black member of the crew and lowers HIM down the very deep hole for some reason before getting a puncture in his space suit and dying.Suddenly again for no explained reason the whole process goes into reverse. Gravity reverses. Energy is being converted into mass! Now they are struggling to keep the ship on the ground! They fail. They are flung into space leaving the black guy and someone who went off to rescue him behind. They go home. Sombrely they step from the ship and make little speeches. Big Shiny Haired scientist is reunited with someone who was cut out of the earlier part of the film. The Lady doctor consoles someone else who was cut out of the earlier part of the film. I wonder who they were because we had seen neither of them before.The original 130minute version may well have been great but its 93minute American version is just rubbish.".

Yeah that's right  First Spaceship to Venus is a commie scifi movie. And while the dialogue may be dubbed inappropriate music may have been added and story elements changed to fit American sensibilities of the time a lot of director Kurt Maetzig's vision gets through. There's a level of intelligence and seriousness often missing from American scifi films of the period. I'm certainly no astrophysicist or any kind of physicist for that matter but a lot of what the scientists discuss and argue about at least sounds good. The special effects are certainly much better than the cardboard cutouts found in similar American films. The special effects especially the Venutian landscape really help to create a surreal atmosphere for the film that's more than a little compelling. Finally though a little too stoic at times the acting is quite good. The characters are played with realism. While it may never match something like Star Wars as an entertaining scifi film First Spaceship to Venus is at a minimum a nice little curiosity piece that actually provokes some interesting questions about the role of technology in the world.For my first viewing I actually watched the MST3K version of First Spaceship to Venus. And while I'm an unabashed fan of the show I feel comfortable in my ability to separate the movie being presented from the nonsense going on around it. And while I found First Spaceship to Venus a real revelation this episode of MST3K is one of the weakest I've yet seen. The jokes are too inconsistent and lack any sort of flow. And the running gag concerning Servo's nonstop sarcasm gets old real quick. Overall on my MST3K rating scale I give this episode of MST3K a 25  find another episode to add to the top of your to see list.".

The Venusians evil plan not only fails but takes all of them with it!The spaceship looks VERY good and the acting though a bit stilted isn't bad. The dubbing isn't good but I'll let that slide.Over all this is an enjoyable film from the tincan spaceships era. For me it gets high marks for the sheer imagination it employed as well as the decision to depict the fact that if humanity is going to explore beyond the surface of our little world ALL of mankind as portrayed by the use of an ethnically diverse crew of astronauts which includes a woman! have a right and a duty to be included in the attempt! Moreover the film's closing message that we MUST continue to reach out and explore the vast Unknown even if we stumble and suffer on the way is most pertinent today in light of our own space program's occasional heartbreaking failures.".

	schema:reviewBody "I hear a lot of people yearning for some mysterious original version of this film which is supposed to last for around 4 hours or so. Well DEFA has recently released an original version DVD and it still runs for exactly 1 hour 30 minutes. If you think the English version was badly dubbed  be prepared for a treat of your lifetime. The multitude of actors this word should be used in parentheses who worked on this film came from Germany Russia Poland China France the Japanese actress is French and Africa and God only knows what mishmash of languages they used on the set. It's all dubbed in German in a sound booth that has the acoustics of a bucket regardless whether the actors are in their space suites in an SoundofMusiclike mountain paradise or fighting the boiling tar on Venus. Amazingly the original version takes place in the year 1970 not 1985 as the version released in the US. I can't really say anything redeeming about this overlit underdirected yarn. There's a bunch of extremely unexciting actor wannabes with the average age of somewhere around 55 who in real life would probably have hard times climbing the stairs to second floor let alone flee from the living slime which at one point is supposed to be so sticky that the slightest drop glues the female to the floor and which a minute later pours over the protagonists like a sea of mud which it is with no visible effect. Everything is shot in a rather small sound stage as opposed to Russian scifi classic Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet and how some viewers can deem this dermatineplasticine world to be eerily alien is far over my head. I remember the time when every Socialist coffee house had furniture like the glass forest of Venus. The way the director the cameramen and the lighting crew have managed to neglect their tasks is biblical. The scriptwriters probably just were somewhere else from the very beginning. The actors are quite often a real pain to behold especially the black astronaut who probably was simply the only black man they had in East Germany and who is so miserable that the director on his more sane moments has wisely asked him to turn his back to the camera while delivering his dialog. Another horrible character is the TVwoman with her bedroom eyes don't forget it's a 1959 Socialist bedroom who covers the event globally on a live Intervision network. Then there are some excitingly unnecessary characters like Brinkmann's mother and Arsenjew's wife who were cut from the first part of the film for US release but for some inexplicable reason can be seen at the ending thus making the whole mess even more perplexing.Oh and let's not forget the despicable but unavoidable precious little robot one of which you can unmistakably find in every 50s scifi flick so you can marvel how it's cute little light bulbs start flashing frantically when it starts talking in a funny little voice! Even though it looks like a tiny toy tank it manages to run over the stomach of a 7 foot Russian astronaut thus giving the petite female surgeon excuse to undress the heroic male and operate on him to save his vitals sorry not shown!.I find Stanislaw Lem one of the best writers in this genre and that makes me wonder whether the fact that his name was used for this miserable screensoiler tormented him throughout his life. Please don't waste your time on this film otherwise you'll want to waste some more time to write a comment about how you wasted your time in the first place.".

This 1959 production by the EastGerman DEFA was the first German produced science fiction film since Fritz Lang's FRAU IM MOND 1929. The special effects seem somewhat dated by today's standards but were quite impressive 40 years ago. This film could stand a comparison with George Pal's DESTINATION MOON 1950. The color photography and the lavish sets are quite an achievement for such a financially restricted studio as the DEFA. The acting sometimes seems a bit wooden but the film is still fun to watch. The only drawback is that this movie is only available on video in a dubbed version in the USA. Although the dubbing job has been done rather well severe cuts have ruined the story and let it look like a fragment film. The USversion was cut by 52 minutes which is almost half of the whole movie. I therefore would like to see the the original version in order to understand the end of this film better.".

	schema:headline " An enjoyable failure";
	schema:reviewBody "Die you Zombie bastards is a film that attempts to tell a humorous tale about world domination via a zombie making machine. The main conflict is between a cannibalistic hero an alien mad scientist. While this is an enjoyable film the end product contains almost no redeemable film making. In essence the film is a lengthy inside joke told very poorly.The main problems with the film lie in the assumptions that it presumes. First odd and sociopathic behavior are used as the driving force of humor. This assumption is not in and of itself flawed. However use of socially taboo behavior as a joke does require some finesse and context to be effective. DYZB provides the bare minimum of context. The audience is made aware that the story takes place on earth and is conducted by people best described as stupid. Such a stark and simplistic context causes all attempts at humor to appear as puerile silliness and shock rather than comedy with any depth. A second assumption is that taboo characters are something that people want to see. To be fair the idea of a cannibalistic hero was a drawing point. Yet the utter lack of any development leads a viewer to disconnect the character from the actor. Essentially one sees a person moving around and one knows that the character is a cannibal yet one does not necessarily care. The attempt to bolster a shockingly low budget film with quirky characters is a complete failure. A last assumption is that stringing a series of sketches together will lead to a full story and film. This is only half correct. DYZB is technically a film however it is quite fairly critiqued as being devoid of story. Basically the film is summarized as A man searches for his wife and also saves the world from a zombie machine. While it is true that many great ideas begin small this is neither great nor an idea really. DYZB is a fragmented set of scenes loosely tied together by an incoherent idea and characterless characters.The above critique is purposefully harsh. The film is actually objectively bad. The production qualities are nil. The camera and camera work are subpar. The acting ranges from wooden to overdone. The editing and story pacing is amateur at its best moments. The sound and special effects are all clearly purchased at a dollar store. In essence this is a terrible film. With all of the above said the film is actually enjoyable. The bad of this film is humorous. DYZB is clearly a stupid idea loved into existence by film students who are probably slightly behind the curve. The point that shines through is that fun was had during the making of this film. Despite being a technical and storytelling failure the film has brief moments that are both fun and humorous. Basically this is a film made more for the people in it than for an audience yet sometimes the audience is included in the joke.On a personal note I will recommend this film to exactly one friend. It is technically a zombie film and thus part of the full zombie experience. The only other advice I have is 1 Watch this with a group of people. 2 Be drunk or somehow intoxicated. 3 Expect nothing of value.".

I mean tone it down some your'e not a Troma movie get over it. Over the top is one thing but this overly ambitious silliness almost resembles something like Drawn Together from Comedy Central more so than a Troma which just has to be what they were going for. That and maybe Chris Seaver and let me tell ya this one ain't no LBP epic either. On the other hand Die You Zombie Bastards! still has a lot going for it that is if you're only watching for the excessive comical gore. Otherwise this movie is just irritatingDie You Zombie Bastards is about a serial Killer Red Toole. Red Toole enjoys murdering mutilating and eating human flesh and like a lot of confused young men Red also really digs superhero's or I guess he think's he is one I don't know. Anyway Toole is a fairly easygoing fellow he seems to really enjoy life and why shouldn't he? Red's hobbypassion is not only tolerated by his wife but the gorgeous Violet has also embraced his love for cannibalism and murder. It's just an all around healthy marriage.For every superhero there has to be the bad guy. Meet Nefarious. A mad scientist with some rather unique fetish's which cant't really be explained on this website. This guy is searching for the perfect woman and on this day he finds her. that's right Toole's girl Violet. With the help of some Zombies and some other fakelooking things Nefarious steals his new girlfriend right from under Toole. From here Red Toole embarks on a world wide New England journey to rescue his hot wife from the clutches of this new rather disturbed enemy named Nefarious. From here everything is just joke after gag after pun after baby noise after confusing inside joke Peanutch?. I was expecting a lot more after reading a lot of the positive reviews. Thank's a lot guys. That money could've gone to something awesome like The Undertaker And His Pals or TeenApe Goes To Camp.What also gets under my skin is all the little flashbacks sorta like in the TV show Scrubs. It's OK for Scrubs because Scrubs isn't as stupid as this. Just doesn't fit in something like this or maybe it does what the hell do I know? Die You Zombie Bastards! is just a little too selfaware for my taste it comes off more like a spoof of Bhorror which can be a good thing but this movie just rubs me the wrong way. Aside from all this were looking at some bold outlandish Exploitation that will leave you exhausted if you try to understand it. Die You Zombie Bastards will force at least a couple laughs out of you regardless of how stupid or pathetic you might or might not think it is. Recommended to those who will give anything a chance as long as superhero's are involved even an overlysilly scifiish Tromawannabe about a serial killing superhero on a stupid little mission called Die You Zombie Bastards! But hey there's always the gore. 410".

When it comes right down to it this movie goes on a little too long and gets too tiresome at times. It's awfully crude and immature  there's more than enough penis jokes on hand  but then one has to assume that that was the whole point. All things considered Die You Zombie Bastards! is still a reasonable amount of fun and gets by on its incredible enthusiasm and fearlessness as it adopts a let's throw all kinds of stuff at the wall and see what sticks approach. It does feature some appreciably wacky ideas as a highly unlikely hero named Red Tim Gerstmar finds that his wife Violet Pippi Zornoza has been abducted by a scheming villain appropriately named Don Nefarious Geoff Mosher who's constructed a diabolical machine dubbed the EnormoZombotron that turns unlucky schmucks into pink haired green skinned zombies. Unfortunately one thing that happens here is that the movie gets a little repetitive as Red has one encounter after another as each supposedly helpful individual he meets refers him to another person. Still there are some fun character moments spread throughout. Sandra Kennedy is particularly delicious as Super Inga. Some schlock fans watching should note the generous dose of bare female flesh on display. The eclectic soundtrack includes a number of entertaining alternative artists with Paul Leary of The Butthole Surfers prominently featured rockabilly artist Hasil Adkins plays himself in the movie and is a hoot even when his dialogue gets incoherent. In a special guest star role is porn legend Jamie Gillis in the role of Stavros making his last appearance in a feature film. Makeup and visual effects are strictly of the aggressively tacky and therefore highly amusing variety. Not that any of us would expect much else from a movie with this title anyway. With nods to Clash of the Titans and Jaws along the way Die You Zombie Bastards! isn't as fun as this viewer would have liked but is also pretty hard to dislike. At least it goes all out for an everything and the kitchen sink style finale. Just don't take the title too literally and expect much in the way of actual zombies.

There's tons of nudity and notsosubtle sexual innuendo. There are many many things that look like penises. There are boob jokes and horribly deformed nipples thanks to Olaf the Cheese Demon!. There are squished heads and zombies in pink suits.

One of the main problems with this film is that it's boring. Several times we found ourselves fast forwarding through some scenes because they were dragging along and have no meaning or relevance whatsoever. Also the gore in this movie isn't great either. I know that it's meant to be cheap but it just sucked. And on top of that the movie really isn't that funny. There were maybe a handful of short scenes that actually made me laugh the scenes with the two cops especially got me giggling Peanutch!. Other than that there's not much else to say about this movie the jokes are dumb the characters are too irritating to be endearing the guy who plays Red is especially annoying and like I said it's boring. So in all I would advise skipping this one even if you're into purposely bad movies this one just isn't worth it.

On the contrary the other characters are little more than clichs Guendalina's father the usual handsome woman chaser  her mother a beautiful unsatisfied woman and the pathetic boyfriend too stupid to capture any empathy from the viewer. What particularly disappointed me is the representation of the scenery. A poor and insignificant photography gives no idea of the emotions that the Versilian landscape was used to communicate to poets artists and especially painters such as Boecklin and Carr. And please...at the end of the movie we are informed that the location is Viareggio. But all the shots at the seaside are taken in Forte dei Marmi a place which is famous for its magic light also in Autumn and Winter. Where did that stunning light go?".

He doesn't perform as much wushu as he does in Shaolin Temple but it is still beautifully performed BY HIM. On alot of his later films especially after Born to defence where he hurt his back severely he has substituted stunt men for the more intensive and dangerous fight choreography which is fair enough considering he is not a trained stunt man.

Jet Li is brilliant when he gets to show emotion other than stoic determination his last 6 films or so. The ensemble cast was brilliant. This is sort of a Chinese 7 Brides for 7 Brothers which actually has a very similar feel and great choreography as well worth checking out seriously. I'm not kidding. Most of the characters are archetypes but never stereotypes. A lot of people will be turned off by this film but I really feel that that would be due to an understanding of Chinese comedy. A particular instance would be when a character nearly gets his face planted in dog leavings and it turns out he hadn't taken the fall. If you haven't seen Jui Kuen Drunken Master starring Jackie Chan you won't get it. I have. I did. If you watch enough movies you tend to understand the genre more. And if you haven't fast forward to the end battle and enjoy the mayhem. I bought this movie on DVD at my local Wallgreens for 3.99 and after watching it I would easily pay 15 or more for this great piece of film. Jet Li in drag little kids kicking ass musical numbers what more could you want? Great DVD transfer from Saturn Prodictions as well. Subtitles that are easy to read full widescreen. Great stuff.".

They see it for the martial arts. This film's emphasis isn't so much on people beating the living daylights out of each other. Instead it's the acrobatics that are most on display. Of course Jet Li as the oldest brother is a brilliant athlete but he isn't the main attraction by far! The kids in the title are DAZZLING!!! There are a few scenes where the clan of Shaolin boys compete with the clan of WuTang girls trying to show each other up. These scenes are some of THE MOST IMPRESSIVE acrobatics I've seen anywhere. During these scenes the background is filled with the beautiful and dramatic steep mountains and winding rivers of China. I really can't say enough about these scenes which easily make the movie great.

	schema:reviewBody "This was Jet Li's second movie and was once again a Mainland Chinese production. The tone is on the opposite end of Shaolin Temple's lighthearted and fun. The movie tells the story of two families on different sides of a river Yu Hai's family of Shaolin martial arts'trained boysone of whom is Jet Li and another guy's family of Wudang Wu Tang swordsmanshiptrained girls. There's been a rivalry between the families and that's interfering with the wedding between various members of the families who love each other. Also there are some vicious bandits who want revenge after Yu Hai rescued the boys and injured their leader.The cast is made up of authentic wushu stylists and it shows. Everyone knows how to fight in this movie. The little girls the little boys the men the women the thieves etc. Therefore all the action is pure authentic Chinese martial arts pole sword 3sectional staff etc. The choreography is a lot different than people today are used to. However if you like your fighting wo extensive use of wire and special FX this is definitely worth checking out. My only gripe is that Jet Li has to compete with the rest of the cast in showing off his skills.The main flaw of this film is that although everyone in the cast are martial artists the ensemble casting and numerous subplots take away from character development and not every subplot gets to be developed. The story jumps from one character's story to the next and therefore not everyone gets to be fully developed.I must say that the story and the children made the film more endearing. Jet Li is probably at his most likable he's up there with his performance in Fong Sai Yuk. The little children are pretty enjoyable little scamps just don't go into the film expecting a deadserious martial arts movie. It's lighthearted and fancy free.".

I also think that the kids are really fun and worthwhile to look at.  My only regret is that they as per usual draw the fights out forever but at the same time that is part of the charm I guess.I wish the DVD or IMDb would have had a better casting with pictures since I simply cannot read the Chinese and I really would like to know other movies that the tomboy girl had played in if anyone knows her name i would appreciate an email All in all quite an OK movie with good kungfu with a no harm done stamp.".

This is not a musical this is martial arts. It also was a little too weird for me. There are some traditions here that really raised my eyebrows. The kids encourage spankings from their Father and a Mother gives birth continuously from what I saw. I realize that may be part of a tradition of sorts but it didn't fly with me and tuned me out even further. I'll continue. Jet Li's character is extremely silly. We do get some fight scenes but I was so angry at what I was seeing I wasn't able to enjoy them. Not everyone will feel the same way but this is just too crazy for its own good.Final Thoughts I'm not a big fan of the first one either but it's at least proficiently done.

This movie is one of my alltime favorite martial arts films because I haven't found many films that highlight young children sparring off besides the My Father is a Hero boy who's name I forgot and I personally love to see the women get in the action.  The last fight scene is great but what did it for me was the children's competition.  Seeing them play fight in animal styles was magic.

The only real links between Shaolin Temple and Shaolin Temple 2 are that they both have Shaolin monks and feature a cast of real life Wushu champions. Many actors from the original appear again playing different characters.As opposed to the first Shaolin Temple movie the tone in this one is that of a lighthearted funny family film. The movie itself is about two rivaling family on opposite sides of a river a Shaolin family of all boys and a swordsmanship family of all girls. The father of the sword family despises the other family. Jet Li still a teenager when he made this film is at his absolute prime and looks simply amazing. He plays the eldest son of the Shaolin family. He demonstrates some amazing skills mainly his staffwork and 3sectional staffwork.Jet Li may be the main attraction but he's not the only one. Another amazing aspect of this film is the children from both families. The children cast were from the junior national Wushu team and it shows. Everybody knows how to fight and all of the children have tremendous talent. It's a real shame none of them grew up to be action stars. Just like in the first Shaolin Temple the actors choreographed all of the action scenes themselves and all the fight scenes are done in long shots to make it look more realistic.Do be warned before letting real young ones watch this though. There is some comedy revolving around private parts and certain personal parts are briefly exposed in the movie. Other than that a pretty awesome movie and an excellent job by Jet Li. 910.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the tradition of other horror movie franchises Phantasm takes the action route for this sequel. The horror and scifi are still there but there's more combat stuff blowingup and gore than there was before. I suppose it does keep things fresh but it does get a bit too tongueincheek sometimes. Kinda like Evil Dead II I'm not sure if this really fits in with the tone set by the first film.Phantasm II begins right after where the first film left off. The freaky dwarfs have invaded Mike's home and Reggie must foil the Tall Man's attempts at kidnapping him. Flash forward seven years and Mike is in a mental institution. He is released upon admitting that the whole Phantasm experience was made up only to find that in his absence the Tall Man has been plundering many of America's small towns and thousands of graves are empty.After the Tall Man kills Reggie's family in a gas explosion Reg teams up with Mike to hunt him down and kick his head in...again. All they have to do is follow the trail of dead people right? And this time they are ready for whatever outlandish tricks he's ready to play on them armed to the teeth with quadruplebarrelled shotguns flamethrowers and chainsaws. Complicating matters are Mike's inexplicable visions of the future and psychic connections to a mysterious girl he has never met before.As before the Tall Man is the best thing in the film. Angus Scrimm is so wonderfully silent and unholy that no matter how slick and entertaining the rest of the film is he'll come out on top.Don Coscarelli was given a budget 10 times that of the original by Universal but they did interfere with production quite a lot much to his annoyance. They said that only one of the original cast members could return so he chose Reggie Bannister and recast Mike with James LeGros after turning down Brad Pitt!. It does kind of ruin the continuity a bit but it's not terribly distracting.They also demanded a more simple and linear story so don't expect any of the bizarre dream sequences and flashbacks. If you're a big fan of the first this might seem disappointing but you know how studios love to think less of their audiences.The higher budget helps Phantasm to have a bigger scope than the original. The first half of the film feels like a road movie with lots of pretty scenery while the rest is kind of like a lowrent GhostbustersLost Boys clone. Which sounds like a negative point but the hokey tone of the film vanishes when it heads off into HP Lovecraft territory.If you're looking for answers as to what the first film was all about then you won't find many. In fact it raises more questions than anything else. But it's still a fun ride. I'm just kind of annoyed that the music took the more generic synth approach that was common in the 80's instead of the funky 70's beats we got before. The main Phantasm theme is still there for your enjoyment however and gets a great finish on the end credits.".

If Liz was such a threat to his evil plans as the plot asserts then wouldn't the Tall Man want to make sure she's dead?  Still when you have a couple psychics an exice cream vendor a mysterious hitchhiker an army of dwarves flying spheres and a rather omnipotentand scarylookingold guy called the Tall Man rolled into one picture the movie promises to be interesting and it delivers for the most part.Compared to the other Phantasm movies I liked Phantasm II better than Phantasm III and Phantasm Oblivion but it's not quite as good as the original Phantasm.".

Frankly I feel this was as good or better than the first but the required shock ending that punctuates each of the films in this series has grown tiresome and makes each feel like they do not truly stand on their own as their own experience. Nevertheless the entire series is original imaginative and involving. Phantasm II really should have capped off the series with it's big budget backing as the very next film in the series felt a lot like Alien 3 where the film picks up characters from the second film discarded in a very unfortunate and disappointing manner...but I digress.

If you agree to go along with it providing suspension of disbelief you'll probably get a nice kick out of P2. IMHO elements of the film music sound effects lighting pacing etc. all contribute well to that end. So if you are genrefriendly let's bump my 7 UP to 8! If the horrorterror genre usually isn't your cup of tea well let's round DOWN to 6...Fair enough? In this case I'd say having seen the original PHANTASM would add tend to add a Star to rating P2 so it does help but isn't absolutely indispensable.I really had forgotten how much gruesome gore there was in the original. There's probably even more here but a lot less than in recent offerings undoubtedly influenced by PHANTASM 1 and 2 like the SAW franchise YECH! As is typically the case in B movies the acting and dialog usually leave a lot to be desired but hey we don't watch these scouting for potential Oscarnominees now do we?!? Bottomline ALL of you who are or have been horrorterror film buffs a semicult classic you won't want to miss or that you'll want to REDUX! If not in the above group...MAYBE NOT!

Despite Universal's interference and insistence on a less dreamlike narrative the backbone of all the other Phantasms director Don Coscarelli manages to give this installment the most polished look and measured exciting pace of the series.While being stuck telling a more onthesurface story than the first film he manages to plant extremely frightening original surrealistic images throughout the film that stick in the viewer's mind foreverI first saw this when I was 12 in a theater and have never forgotten it. A priest's worried look over his shoulder at his empty town a writhing screaming parasite burning to death.. auto parts hanging from a burning tree after a car crash..gasmasked beings carting exhumed coffins across a porcelain hallway an abandoned mortuary..full of freshly lit candles! The stark simplicity of the doorway to the villain's homeworld. Hooded creatures storming Reggie's kitchen in the dark. And on and on..The story is simple enough seven years after the original a teenaged Mike now played by James Le Gros is released from an asylum and is immediately drawn back into the Tall Man's game traveling through an emptied America into a nightmare that could very well all be in his mind. This early in the series the mysterious Tall Man is just that.. he probably has ten minutes screen time in the film and yet the mood and pacing always make you nervous that he'll appear behind you and cart you off to be part of his experiments. Where IS he? What is he doing when we do not see him? This lack of resolution actually works for the picture's benefit and not against it. Indeed though Phantasm spawned an additional two intelligent emotional sequels as we learned more about the villain Mike and Reggie are up against we're much less frightened of him.Angus Scrimm is at his creepiest in this installment. Reggie begins to take his place as audience favorite a reluctant hero on par with Ash Evil Dead and Dr. Loomis. Le Gros does well as the buff but still doubtful Mike. Kudos to character actor Kenneth Tigar for his role as the tortured priest who can't close his eyes to the things he's seen who manages to draw us in with his nuanced emotional performance. He could have easily shown up to give exposition and get killed instead he manages to keep the viewer hooked AND meet his untimely end.Full of suspense scares and action Phantasm II may not be the mindbender of the original but it's no a less worthy chapter of the most surrealistic thoughtprovoking horror series ever created.".

His film used great special effects and a very creepy score by Fred Myrow Soylent Green Rubin and Ed. Nine years later Coscarelli teamed up with actors Reggie Banister and Angus Scrimm again to make the appropriately titled Phantasm II.While certainly not as creepy as the first film Phantasm II is certainly very fun. Coscarelli was able to use better special effects than in the first film and it certainly is noticeable. Also this sequel goes with the Evil Dead II logic of bigger is better. Chainsaw duels and explosions are added not to mention an arsenal of extremely cool weapons including a home made flamethrower and a really cool double shotgun. But bigger is not always better...One problem that this film has is that it does not capture the coming of age theme that the first film has. While this is understandable because all the characters have aged nine years the feeling the first film had of investigating something creepy in town is something we can all relate to. Stand by Me Blue Velvet and the first Phantasm all used this very appropriately but I only wish that the sequel did as well. Another problem I have is that the character of Mike is so different. In the first he was a curious youngster similar to Jeffrey Beaumont in Blue Velvet but he is much different in this film as he is much more level headed. However it is better that his character has changed because he fits the mood of this film.Phantasm II is not a spectacular film but I really do enjoy it and that's why I rate it a nine out of ten. It is a rather different film from the first but is still extremely fun and that's the reason why I rate it as one of my favorites. Don't go expecting the same mood of Phantasm but rather the mood of Army of Darkness...THIS MOVIE GETS BONUS POINTS FOR...Angus Scrimm great special effects creepy soundtrack".

Phantasm II is probably my fave in the series not because of the action most phans say it's the most action packed but I think part III holds that honor but really this is the only one where Reggie and Mike are side by side and in my opinion thats why it's the best in all the others Reggie being the horn dog he is is trying to find mike AND get laid...which is still cool.  I can't believe that no other phans have mentioned how much Phantasm II mirrors Evil Dead 2 I know they've had to notice it that however is not a problem cause right next to the Phantasm series is the Evil Dead series.  Just look at it and you will see what I'm talking about.  Phantasm II follows Evil Dead 2 by going into comedy at times others have complained that Phantasm III had comedy but they for some reason they forget II did also....it just wasn't as campy but still was funny like when Reggie beat a dwarf creature into pieces by going crazy on it with the end of a shot gun or the look on his face when Alchemy is riding him and smacks him on top of his head and when he pulls a chainsaw on the graver at the end only for the graver to pull out a really LONG chainsaw...and of course just about everything Reggie says is funny.  And like Ash getting equipped with his chainsaw in ED 2 Reggie gets his now trademark 4barrel shotgun and the scene where the mortician gets a sphere in his back and bounces all over the room makes me think of ED 2. But believe me Phantasm II is not a copy cat of ED 2.  It still has some creepy stuff in it like the scene where the grandfather is getting his mouth sewn up.  But this movie screams atmosphere more than anything with it's great score and visual style really helping to push that home.  All the actors give great performances and The Tall Man is the ultimate villain thanks to a great creepy performance by Angus Scrimm...all he's gotta do is twitch an eyebrow.  Also the scene where the priest gets it is really cool you can tell that the MPAA made them trim it though but thats just my opinion.  But I think what really separates this horror series from most is that in almost all the other you root for Freddy Jason or Michael Myers and even though I love The Tall Man God bless you Mr. Scrimm Reggie is without a doubt THE man.  Some people may have Indiana Jones or any of those guys as their fave characters but mine will always be Reggie played perfectly by Reggie Bannister along with the Ash character from Evil Dead Bruce Campbell...need I say more Herbert West from the ReAnimator series Jeffrey Combs...one of the funniest actors around and the best character Kurt Russell no introduction needed EVER played....no it's not Snake Plissken...but Jack Burton from the great Big Trouble in Little China. Sorry for going off on a rant there just wanted you to know.  Anyways Reggie is the glue that holds the series together.  Why Universal has not put this and part III out on DVD is beyond me yet they will do another DVD edition of The Mummy remake.  I think the reason this series is not as well known is because of the studio's killing it's chances check out the web site on how they released Phantasm II and instead of going in different directions to gain mass appeal like the Elm Street series....which if I'm right Don Coscarelli was offered to direct part 2...the most under appreciated of that series the Phantasm series as they went and hopefully go on tried to please it's core audiance.  And the series keeps the same characters through out so you really care for these guys and like them want to know what the hell is going on.  I love these movies more than any other series and hope they are continued to be made.  Hopefully we will see that Roger Avary penned script be made into a movie soon.".

We've got a chainsaw dual cool characters in the Regman Mike and the Tall Man and a hell of a lot of action!! Right from the opening title when you hear the atmospheric theme which is amazing by the way the tone is set and you know you're in for something special.With the help of some dark and fantastical imagery the story is laid out. Mike and Reggie are hunting down the Tall Man a mysterious undertaker from another world who plunders graveyards and carts the dead off to be crushed into evil slave midgets. The movie strikes a chord with some of its imagery especially those of embalming. What better way to be reminded of your mortality than to see a cadaver having his mouth sewn shut and later another being drained of his blood and pumped with chemicals? Perhaps the Tall Man sums it up best when he says You think when you die you go to heaven? You come to US!! It may make you uncomfortable to think about such things but that is the point at least partially.Don't get up to get a beer on this one either. The movie has such a quick pace you'll be left behind and might miss one of the many memorable scenes Reggie and Mike walking through an empty graveyard Father Meyer's encounter with a sphere the quadbarreled shotgun or the aforementioned chainsaw dual!!All in all Phantasm II is a film that surpasses its predecessor itself a classic and takes you on a 90minute rollercoaster ride. It's fun actionpacked and above all highly entertaining.".

I Also like the Plot Setting Script and of course The Truly Scary Climaxes.I Also enjoyed the fact that this Movie played with the ending of the Original. Is This Movie something that could be called a Cult Classic? Yes. Any Horror Fan Who has not seen this Movie needs to pick this Stuff up Today! I was very Pleased to see that the Tall Man made it on an Essential horror D.V.D. entitled Boogeymen. If You saw Part One and were Disappointed Don't give up hope. SEE THIS MOVIEAs Far as others in the Series go Part One is rather Average Part Two is the best Three is Okay but better than Part One And Part Four A.K.A. Phantasm Oblivion is better than Part Three but Slightly worse than this One.I give this 10 out of 10.Fans of this Might like Puppet Master Leprechaun Nightmare on Elm Street Halloween The Dead hate the Living Night of the living Dead Slumber Party Massacre Sorority House Massacre The Evil Dead I and II City of the Living Dead Prison of the Dead Hideous!

	schema:headline " A fine example of how a good sequel should be";
	schema:reviewBody "After watching the Phantasm movies again and again for years I've always thought that this second installment is the best.First of all it starts the saga as it is. Don Coscarelli has stated many times that he never intended part I to be followed by a sequel so if you check out the continuity between the two it's incredibly perfect and accurate in this one. In my opinion it's got the best prologue of the saga. Phantasm II picks up the best things of Part I and takes the plot onto a whole new direction a path that will be followed by the other sequels. Guys if there's a Phantasm Saga it's because of Part 2.Apart from this all ingredients and characters are very well balanced and developed horror scifi action humor Alchemy the priest. If for example you compare P2 next to P3 you'll realize that sense of humor goes over the top in the latter. Also P3 seems to forget that the real main hero of the story is Mike. OK Reggie is my favorite character but I've always thought that he works better as a sidekick P2 rather than as the leading guy.Another important reason is that to me this is the darkest and most adult entry in the series it's got the goriest moments and the creepiest atmosphere and takes the plot very seriously. Special effects are great too although being a low budget Bmovie and the cheapest film produced by Universal in 1988 it looks like a superproduction. And what can we say about the girls? Liz is the best partner Mike will ever have and Chemy the most dangerous and sexiest chick Reggie will ever meet. Next to these characters the other girls in the series look terribly underdeveloped Lady in Lavender in Part I Jennifer in part IV or too far out Rocky and Edna in Part III.Some people complaint that this sequel unlike its predecessor spells everything out for you. No doubt P2 is the most linear installment in the series but that doesn't necessary mean that spells everything out for you. OK more dream sequences wouldn't have been bad but I prefer a standard plot well developed and executed rather than a twisted story full of holes forced elements and unsatisfying explanations P3 and P4.P2 is separated from P1 almost 10 years in time. Universal Pictures planned that the target audience for P2 should include people who never saw the original. They didn't want to take too many risks with the sequel of a movie that wasn't a huge success at the time and was released a decade before. That's the main reason why Universal executives forced Coscarelli to cast somebody else for Mike's part and write a more linear plot without mixing dreams and reality. Because of this P2 is the only installment in the series that you can watch and understand without having seen P1.Now James LeGros is THE BEST Mike EVER. He portrays a strong tough grown up Mike. But he can also look sensitive and fragile. Michael Baldwin was great in Part I but sometimes when an actor grows up he doesn't fit in the same role as good as in the past. In P3 and P4 Baldwin looks weak and lost and his lack of charisma and sex appeal is what makes Reggie take the leading part. James LeGros is a better actor and a better choice for Mike.".

I loved they used more flying spheres in this movie and added a little more gore new monsters it's a new ride from the first!

	schema:headline " Ingenious horror sequel!";
	schema:reviewBody "Phantasm 2 is a proud member of a select group of films  sequels that are better than the first. The pace of the movie doesn't let up for a second and it does therefore manage to stay exciting and entertaining for it's duration. The sequel picks up at first where the first film left off with Reggie Bannister battling dwarfs that have overrun his home. From there the film switches to seven years later. Mike James LeGros in the role of one of the hero's of the first film is now being released from a mental hospital after seven years of therapy. Despite this therapy and admitting that it didn't actually happen Mike still knows that the horrible goings on that landed him in the hospital in the first place actually happened and when he gets out he means to do something about it and that is something that he does.As Mike says to Reggie at one point in the film I'm a nineteen year old kid and you're a bald middleaged exice cream vendor and that's what sets Phantasm aside from all the similar films in this vein of horror. The characters here despite being in an abnormal situation are not comically overblown and they don't have subhuman abilities they're just normal people thrown into an abnormal situation. Reggie Bannister who as mentioned takes the role of 'Reggie' in the film makes a great horror hero. Although not up to the high standard of Ash Evil Dead or most of the other hero's that the horror genre has given us Reggie has a niche of his own. Most hero's aren't bald middleaged exice cream vendors but the fact that Reggie is not only highlights the tongue in cheek theme of the Phantasm series but also gives the film a place of it's own within the horror genre.You'll be glad to know that this sequel features a chainsaw. The chainsaw is a weapon of such undeniable greatness that I find it hard to understand why anyone wouldn't want a chainsaw in their movie. The weapon is so far apart from all other melee weapons in terms of horror credibility that it almost has a life of it's own just the way it sounds is enough to strike fear into the heart of many a viewer. The chainsaw enters the fray in a delicious sequence that sees our hero's raid a hardware store and tool up a la Evil Dead II. At first I thought that the movie would tease me in terms of the chainsaw as in the early stages of the movie it only features in a few scenes that see Reggie tear doors down and such but the film doesn't disappoint as later on we get treated to a great sequence that involves Reggie battling another chainsaw wielding foe. I love chainsaws.One of the most memorable things about Phantasm were the silver spheres that flew up and down funeral parlour corridors and we've got more of that here. The sequel is a lot more gory than I thought it would be and that is no bad thing. The flying spheres feature a lot in the movie's more gory scenes and I for one think that they are an ingenious creation. These balls attach themselves to their victim via two prongs on the front and then proceed to drill a hole through their head which results in plenty of bloodshed coming out of the other end of the sphere. Lovely. Also like the first film a lot of this movie takes place in funeral homes and other such morbid areas and that creates a great horror feel that few horror films have matched.Overall Phantasm 2 is a must see for fans of the original and a must see for those that aren't yet fans of the original after they have seen the original. Don Coscarelli would later go on to direct one of 2002's best films in 'Bubba HoTep' but it easy to see that the Phantasm series is his labour of love. The kind of heart that has gone into this series is overwhelming and even if you don't like the movie you have to admire it if only for the obvious amount of love that Don has for the series he created.".

	schema:reviewBody "Phantasm II is as good a sequel to Don Coscarellis' original shocker as one could hope for. Essentially it's to its predecessor what Aliens was to Alien a genre crossing movie that puts the accent on action and lots of it. It's exciting gleefully macabre stuff that has a real fun factor going for it.It gets down to business fairly quickly picking up where the first film left off and then fast forwarding to several years later when Mike James Le Gros is being released from a mental hospital. Mike is still determined to battle the nefarious Tall Man Angus Scrimm and convinces his good buddy Reg Reggie Bannister to join him in the fight. They track their nemesis down to a small Oregon town named Perigrod and find that he's still up to his old tricks.One has to take some bad with the good considering that this was a major studio sequel to an independently made classic. The budget allows for greater scope and superduper effects but Universal flexed its muscle and made sure that this was a more linear and less surreal movie than Phantasm one. They also made Bannister and A. Michael Baldwin audition for their old roles and in the end would only let Coscarelli keep one of them. It was also their idea to give Mike a love interest a sweet gal named Liz Paula Irvine to whom Mike is psychically connected.What's truly a delight here is seeing the affable Bannister ascend to the role of a badass hero. He and Le Gros make a good team as they vow to fight evil. Their impromptu shopping trip calls to mind a similar sequence with Arnold in the action favourite Commando. Scrimm gets barely any screen time but in this case a little does go a long way we always look forward to his next appearance. Samantha Phillips adds some sex appeal as hitchhiker Alchemy busy character actor Kenneth Tigar does alright as a frightened priest and Stacey Travis Hardware has a brief part as Liz's sister. The atmosphere is still good one of the most successful aspects to the film is seeing the damage wrought by the Tall Man and his minions as Mike and Reg pass through towns that have become forlorn wastelands and Daryn Okadas' cinematography is excellent. The infamous spheres are back and the makeup effects and gore supervised by Mark Shostrom are fun to watch  and not as unrelenting as Leonard Maltins' paperback review would have you believe. The music by Fred Myrow and Christopher L. Stone is the icing on the cake that theme still has the power to chill.Overall Phantasm II is a must for horror and action fans and holds up as prime '80s entertainment.Eight out of 10.".

It had a good spooky finish and this movie sort of ruins it. Angus Scrimm is good as the tall man and the guy who played Reggie is back as well. Jodie however is played by a different guy though it doesn't detract to much from this one as he was a kid in the first so you don't really notice. However when they switch back to the original kid in the next one it is a bit noticeable. Here we have Reggie and Jodie going after the tall man. He has basically wiped out both of their families so they now have nothing left to lose. They get themselves an arsenal that includes two shotguns secured together that for some reason would become popular. So popular in fact that they would return in the next movie even though it was clearly dropped and left behind in this one. The tall man has his weapons two as he has three spheres of doom here. In the next movie they would pretty much be the main focus but here they are still just a weapon used by the tall man. He also has his dwarfs and his creepy morticians. This one is a bit more action oriented than the first and not as creepy but it does work rather well and is entertaining.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is probably my favorite film in the Phantasm series and not to mention one of my favorite films during the VHS revolution of the 1980's and early 90's. The sequel to the cult classic Phantasm contains all of the campy weirdness and comical elements that made that era so significant for true horror film fans. Taking place much later after the events of the first film an already grown Mike James Le Gros is released from the Morningside psychiatric facility unconvinced that the Tall Man Angus Scrimm and his dwarf minions are products of his imagination. He must persuade his longtime friend and companion Reggie Bannister that the events from 8 years ago were in fact a reality. After Reggie's house explodes along with his entire family its time to hit the road with the classic 1971 black HemiCuda 426 and shopping carts full of weapons to stop the Tall Man's quest to rob every grave and kill every person who inhabits the small towns of the Northwestern United States. This is classic 80's actionhorrorcomedy filmmaking with Director Don Coscarelli once again at the helm for what is a wild twisted and bizarre journey into skewered reality and fantasy. Every device from the original Phantasm is back and better including the flying killer silver spheres which get much more screen time in this chapter. A likable cast is in top form including Mike's love interest Paula Irvine whom he as a psychic link with and the unfortunate Father Meyers Kenneth Tigar. Reggie and Mike make a great team of hunters battling the forces of the undead with flamethrowers chainsaws modified shotguns and other various weapons. This has much more gore and bloodshed than the first film and the relationships between the characters especially Mike and Liz have good chemistry. There's never a dull moment and plenty of comic relief make this a memorable addition to the ultraweird world of Phantasm. Reggie and Angus return for Phantasm III in 1994.".

Looks like they're finally going to get to the bottom of the enigma of Phantasm right? Wrong! What you do get is more flying spheres attacking folk more weirdness bigger set pieces and a lot of fun.

It's hard to describe a plot which involves people chasing each other about but this time our heroes have also got to contend with the Tall Man's assistants all of whom meet very gory deaths. The film is a lot more linear than the last one so 'linear' fans might get a kick out of that.".

	schema:reviewBody "One does not need to have seen any of the other films in this series to enjoy Phantasm II. The story though odd is easy to pick up on. Once we are introduced to everyone it is easy to figure out what they represent and what they have on their agendas. The story centers around two men Reggie Bannister and James Legros attempting to track down and kill The Tall Man played with sinister creepiness by Angus Scrimm. When you are name Angus Scrimm its a pretty good bet you are going to end up as a horror movie actor. Angus Scrimm the Pediotrist just doesn't sound right. But this Tall Man and his minions travel from one small town to the next robbing graves and turning the corpses into evil dwarfs resembling Jawas from Star Wars. And in Phantasm II The Tall man has apparently made the jump from not only harvesting the dead to also preying on the living. Needless to say he must be stopped.This is a gory campy film that is fairly wellpaced. The acting is as good as one could ask for though the experience of the cast is fairly limited to this series itself and other genre pics. Only James Legros really went on to do more high profile projects after this. And he seems to have peaked in the 1990s. The action is played out in a series of explosions characters battling each other with hardware store equipment and using mortuary devises to inflict painful death. The Tall man has quite a lot at his disposal. He has his dwarf army creepy mortuary workers gas maskwearing grave diggers and chrome spheres that seek out and suck the brains from the nearest person they find. But our heroes are also heavily armed drive a fast car and have a determination to see this thing through to the end.The only trouble is this is just one of four parts to this series. Even though things seemed to be wrapped up nicely until the final frames apparently this story goes on and on. And though I enjoyed this film I'm still not compelled to seek out the other three. I got the point just fine with this one. The writerdirector of this film has not done a lot else outside this series. Perhaps he has ideas and just can't get funding. Or maybe just no additional ideas. If you are a true fan of this series more power to you. If not and you still come across Phantasm II give it a look. Its wellmade gory suspenseful and the production values aren't dirtcheap. 7 of 10 stars.The Hound.".

The vague phallic symbolism of the Candyman's hook is here expanded upon the sociological issues toned down while the beautiful theme is ditched in favour of a generic pop beat. Lead Donna D'Errico has gorgeous breasts but do we really need to see them all through the film? A plastic temptress who like Kelly Rowan couldn't hold a candle to Virginia Madsen she fails to wear a bra in any single scene. She even goes topless on two occasions one of four actresses in the movie to do so. That's Day of the Dead all over gratuitous nudity bad language gore and a total lack of credibility.The Mexican element is in no way stereotypical. No instead characters make love to Latino guitar music after downing Tequilas. S277nr. While a group of Candy disciples obviously spent so long in worshipping him they had no time for acting lessons. Poor old Candyman marginalised in his own franchise in favour of D'Errico's nipples resorts to saying be my victim about ten million times. Maybe he's really saying bee  my victim! in reference to those lamely CGIed insects that fly around him? Perhaps not. Candyman states he wants to reclaim his dignity.

There was not a good capturing of the Day of the Dead Mexican festival atmosphere Candyman movies rely on their atmosphere and mythology to survive. Missing were the crowd celebration scenes which would make the Day of the Dead seem more real. I did not achieve any greater an understanding of the festival of the dead. The story writers did not bother to tie the Mexican mythos very tightly to the story elements. They semitried with the oraclelike grandmother but it turned out laughable rather than mysterious. The Candyman himself was not mysterious or hidden enough which made him less scary. They gave him plenty of dialogue with the repeated phrase Be my victim  sloppy dialogue writing.Gone was most of the the eerie hypnotic and romantic Philip Glass music score which was Candyman's signature. The filmmakers opted for generic horror movie music which boots the movie down immediately.Consistency was one problem of Candyman 3. In the flashbacks the filmmakers changed the origin of the Candyman from a field in the daytime of part 2 to a nighttime forest hanging scene. The final showdown with the Candyman in the painted tin shack was a letdown compared to the Cabrini bonfire of 1 and the flooding Gothic mansion of 2. Believability did not exist enough to draw me into the story. What was with that strange Candyman cult  could people be that misguided? The love connection between the leading lady and her love interest was hardly believable. The law enforcers in the movie were utilized unconvincingly only to wrap up the story.The lead actress was too beautiful and unintelligent to be convincing or sympathetic. I didn't care whether any of the characters in the movie survived.It was a shame minor spoiler Annie fought so hard in Candyman II  only to be disrespected in part 3. This movie seemed more like a bad dream than a true entry in the Candyman franchise. Artisan dropped the ball on this sequel. If they do ever another one I hope they can return it to its creepy roots.What did this movie have going for it? Not much. I wouldn't recommend it to the rental crowd.

Not only can he still be summoned by saying his name 5 times in the mirror this curse was supposed to be broken in the last film now he just kills anyone who doesn't believe in him indiscriminately...even if they don't summon him.Though mostly it's people around the main character Caroline Donna D'Errico the daughter of Annie and thus great granddaughter of Daniel Robataille from Candyman 2.This is basically the almost softcore porn version of Candyman.Literally almost every scene has the potential to bust into porn...there are a few close calls too...and at least one instance where it kinda does.Seems like they used the porn stars own kids as the child actors in this as well.That being said I can see why Tony Todd took the part...I would too...Ironically it probably has the creepiest Candyman. Tony Todd must have been extra motivated or something. And they definitely have the best full shot of Candyman with his jacket open in this.Not many special effects utilized in the kill department though other than people getting impaled by hooks. They just use the same gag over and over. Though the one scene with the bees on the girl had notably better CGI and that bee in the blood egg thing was cool too.They did set themselves up for some sweetsosweetness with that twist that leads to the massacre...but they don't even show anything! The fck is that?! The aftermath scenes in this just don't live up to those from the first film.Anyways...it turns out Candyman gets triggered when Caroline allows his art to be exploited. And thus acts in the exact opposite way that he does in the previous film by specifically trying to kill his remaining relatives wanting to bring them over to the dead side with him. He holds her to the same Faustian bargain that he does Helen from the first film.How many ways is there to kill a Candyman?! That's what I want to know...Cause this is getting ridiculous. But to be fair...this seems like the more true of the two sequels4.5 out of 10.".

The fck is that?! The aftermath scenes in this just don't live up to those from the first film.Anyways...it turns out Candyman gets triggered when Caroline allows his art to be exploited. And thus acts in the exact opposite way that he does in the previous film by specifically trying to kill his remaining relatives wanting to bring them over to the dead side with him. He holds her to the same Faustian bargain that he does Helen from the first film.How many ways is there to kill a Candyman?! That's what I want to know...Cause this is getting ridiculous. But to be fair...this seems like the more true of the two sequels4.5 out of 10.";

But her gallery presenter the building is his wants to instead publicize the myth in order to call attention to the show and orchestrate potential revenue. Miguel Mark AdairRios urges Caroline to look into a mirror and say Candyman's name five teams if she doesn't believe in the myth and through this action appears to have genuinely resurfaced him from whatever beyond he belongs. An actor hired by Miguel David Jsu Garcia A Nightmare on Elm Street 1984 appears as a Candyman nut with hook hand to scare up the attendees and Caroline as a pub stunt. When Miguel and a model Rena Riffel are found murdered thanks to the Candyman Caroline she found them becomes a possible suspect but David is specifically under suspicion. When Caroline's actress roommate  pal Alexia Robinson is gutted by the Candyman and literally dropped her in her arms she becomes the official arrest for the supernatural killer's crimes. Meanwhile Candyman calls out for Caroline to come to him take her own life and join him wherever that is. A racist cop Wade Williams with a short fuse temper is out to get Caroline for the murder of his partner yet another given the hookgut treatment. It will all culminate in some old warehouse where the paintings stolen from Caroline's gallery and Candyman await. It seems there's a Candyman cult in LA who want to summon him having showed up at the gallery and become totally enthralled by the mythos. Plot is a mess too much of Candyman yapping constantly in one visit to Caroline after another a significant interest not that this bothered me too much in showing lead Donna D'Errico's bust and walking around scantily clad diminishing results in the special gore effects this goaround and a laughable finale where all it takes is tearing up a painting of Candyman in order to harm him Candyman Day of the Dead is a pitiful proclamation that the series was not on life support as much as totally flatlined. No atmosphere or a Philip Glass score to save it this time. Todd owns this character and even if tasked to talk too much instead of smoothly emerging in and out of the story less is more was always beneficial in letting Todd be appreciated when he appears instead of getting him as much as possible to the point where the power in seeing him deteriorates the actor still has a presence and chemistry that is undeniable. The use of bees to suffocate Riffel and how they emerge from Todd's mouth and rotted torso are a bit much. Much like Pinhead a series of films which feature Candyman gradually rusted his sinister sheen. D'Errico is definitely nice to look at and her tight Tshirts emphasize her impressive chest while her performance always seemed secondary in importance. Virginia Madsen she is not. Major sin not making the Day of the Dead more colorful and alive a backdrop even though D'Errico goes through a crowd while Wade Williams gave chase with police behind him. D'Errico constantly fainting and collapsing every time Candyman is close becomes more than a bit tiresome. While Todd's made a lot worse than this the 2000s became a decade where he would take whatever role would come his way Candyman Day of the Dead marked a disappointing conclusion to the franchise it started out so well too. Sadly the end of the 90s led a decline in quality parts Todd would be offered after. Williams as the cop from hell is clearly a purposely abusive and overtly violent dirtbag representing bigots on the force in LA. When the very first scene has D'Errico in short shirt and panties walking into a bathroom it is obvious the film will desperately beg for the audience's attention...her figure certainly doesn't hurt.".

	schema:reviewBody "And so we have the second sequel to a film that worked best as a standalone horror outing. Clive Barker's mix of fairytale and the macabre made 1992's CANDYMAN a splendid little movie evocative and atmosphere and a breath of fresh air amidst the latest NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET or Friday THE 13TH sequel. Sadly the rules of movie moneymaking never change and so two unnecessary sequels followed that added absolutely nothing to the story and served only to besmirch the original's reputation.CANDYMAN 3 DAY OF THE DEAD offers by way of story a straightforward repeat of the first film's plot a young woman is haunted by a ghostly killer who nobody else believes exists. She's subsequently blamed for the murders carried out by this ghost and she must find a way to stop it before either a she goes mad b she faces a life in prison or c she herself dies. The law of diminishing returns means that everything on screen is a lesser imitation of that which has come before and the excruciatingly predictable script means that there's nothing in the way of originality or genuine scares here.Director Turi Meyer had little experience of filmmaking before this but the direction can't really be faulted  even if it is a little bland. No the biggest problem lies in the casting of former Baywatch starlet Donna D'Errico as the heroine. D'Errico is a horrible actress excruciating when it comes to her 'fear' scenes and she's just paraded around in a variety of tightfitting vest tops and knickers. Nice body shame about the talent. The supporting cast are all very bland with the exception of the sorely underused Ernie Hudson Jr.  son of the GHOSTBUSTERS actor  who seems to have inherited some of his dad's talent. And then there's Tony Todd who is menacing and brilliant as the Candyman and the only real reason to watch this. Todd is one of those actors generally stuck in Bmovies who always give a decent performance and Danny Trejo is another. He isn't required to do anything other than stand around and whisper 'be my victim' but he even does that well.There are some repetitive gore sequences here generally involving people being impaled by Candyman's hook as well as a plethora of nude scenes in a bid to attract some male attention. Sadly these don't distract from the crappy script and general tired air surrounding the proceedings. CANDYMAN is a good film but the sequels are best forgotten about.".

The law of diminishing returns means that everything on screen is a lesser imitation of that which has come before and the excruciatingly predictable script means that there's nothing in the way of originality or genuine scares here.Director Turi Meyer had little experience of filmmaking before this but the direction can't really be faulted  even if it is a little bland. No the biggest problem lies in the casting of former Baywatch starlet Donna D'Errico as the heroine. D'Errico is a horrible actress excruciating when it comes to her 'fear' scenes and she's just paraded around in a variety of tightfitting vest tops and knickers. Nice body shame about the talent. The supporting cast are all very bland with the exception of the sorely underused Ernie Hudson Jr.  son of the GHOSTBUSTERS actor  who seems to have inherited some of his dad's talent. And then there's Tony Todd who is menacing and brilliant as the Candyman and the only real reason to watch this. Todd is one of those actors generally stuck in Bmovies who always give a decent performance and Danny Trejo is another. He isn't required to do anything other than stand around and whisper 'be my victim' but he even does that well.There are some repetitive gore sequences here generally involving people being impaled by Candyman's hook as well as a plethora of nude scenes in a bid to attract some male attention. Sadly these don't distract from the crappy script and general tired air surrounding the proceedings. CANDYMAN is a good film but the sequels are best forgotten about.";

There is virtually no suspense no thrills and absolutely no scares. Not only that but it's really boring. There are far too many times where I felt like dozing off. That shouldn't be happening with Candyman. There is gore but I didn't care. We get your usual hook carnage and some CGI bees. The acting is pretty bad. Tony Todd looks disillusioned and embarrassed by this sequel. He knows what a piece of crap this sequel is. He's shown way too much and the mystique is gone. What a shame! Donna D'Errico felt like a model and nothing more. Her performance is amateurish and she had no business being the heroine in this movie. Needless to say she failed to evoke sympathy from me. Jsu Garcia NOES fame grabs a quick paycheck. A reviewer on this site called this a pathetic end I couldn't have said it any better. It ranks as one of the worst endings to a horror franchise.

But overall this is a good sweet one with plenty of action and excellent animation. Penlope Cruz sounds sexy as usual and Nicholas Cage is unrecognizable as Speckles the mole I didn't know it was him until I saw the credits but he's terrific. And though they appeared for a total of a little over few minute Bucky the hamster who is a quarter ferret and the three mice were adorable.I'll recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good laugh on a lazy afternoon. And for the kids! 7 out of ten!".

But overall this is a good sweet one with plenty of action and excellent animation. Penlope Cruz sounds sexy as usual and Nicholas Cage is unrecognizable as Speckles the mole I didn't know it was him until I saw the credits but he's terrific. And though they appeared for a total of a little over few minute Bucky the hamster who is a quarter ferret and the three mice were adorable.I'll recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good laugh on a lazy afternoon. And for the kids! 7 out of ten!";

But that it is not what kids want they would want to see action blazing through their ways. As this being a Jerry Bruckheimer production you can expect at least a car chase and some explosion but only more mild. Trevor Rabin did a good work in creating epic music. Though a kid movie expect some rude humour but also at the same time some lessons to teach your kids.Overall Definitely not as bad as what haters say.

	schema:headline " A fun adventure but a cookiecutter and ridiculous plot spoils it.";
	schema:reviewBody "GForce the family adventure by producer Jerry Bruckheimer Pirates of the Caribbean isn't a bad movie by any count and works as a fun kids movie. But a tired and formulaic plot means the movie is no 'mustwatch' by any means and caters mostly to the little ones. The story follows a specially trained team of secret agent guinea pigs that work for the US government. Their mission is to stop an evil billionaire Bill Nighty who manufactures home appliances from taking over the world through a microchip he has planted in them.To begin with the positives the animation is topnotch. The guinea pigs look very photorealistic and after a few minutes you forget they're CGI. There is an inherent cuteness factor to them and just like last year's Alvin and the Chipmunks the filmmakers know that this will be the biggest draw for kids and their parents. There are plenty of jokes to keep a smile on your face although the toilet humor gets old after a while.But that brings me to the story. How many times have you heard this Evil genius wants to take over the world and only the unlikeliest of heroes can save the world.? Too many to count I imagine. And GForce fits right into that category. The plot is tired and doesn't attempt to bring anything new to the table. There are subplots strangely similar to last year's Bolt and the finale has an uncanny resemblance to Transformers. Aside from being predictable from the very start the biggest problem here comes out in the final reels  the villain's motivations are laughably ridiculous. As if it wasn't hard enough to stomach the improbability in an evil billionaire's plan to take over the world by installing timed microchips in every home appliance he manufactures the final act tries to implement a twist so ridiculous and farfetched that one wonders what was going on in their mind when coming up with it. Sure kids will chew it up but adults are sure to gasp at the screen at the stupidity of it all. Still lessons are learned and there's a bit of emotional quotient towards the end that makes partially saves it.Another problem is the action scenes. There are too many of them and most of them are uninvolving. The movie opens with a 10 minute long covert operation that gets tiring a quarter of the way through. And every other ten minutes or so comes another chase or mission that only serves as eyecandy and gets monotonous and unfocused especially in the finale. The special effects are great but what's the need for exploding cars and buildings in a kid's movie?The voice acting is impressive. Sam Rockwell Penelope Cruz and Nicolas Cage do a great job bringing their characters to life. Bill Nighty plays a stock villain with no character development or motivation and it comes across badly. Zach Galifianakis impresses as the leader of the team but Will Arnett is wasted in a small and too serious of a role for a comedian of his caliber.So is GForce recommended? Mostly if you have kids or are between 313 years old. It's not a bad movie by a stretch it's much better than last year's Beverly Hill Chihuahua and you will not get bored in the theaters but it's a shame that the movie could have been so much more. They had an interesting bunch of characters on screen but unfortunately they settled on making cookiecutter Hollywood fare than something truly unique.Rating  2.5 out of 5 stars.".

There were references to well known movies like Apocalypse Now Scarface and The Untouchables but even those I couldn't find funny because it was as if the writers didn't put them in because it worked naturally but rather set out to make references to the movies and just inserted them into any place that sort of made sense. There were also quite a few fart jokes in this movie something that Disney never should have stooped to.The music selections were nothing but the latest Top 40 hits and each seemed to be used at least three times in the movie.

Or something along those lines.I watched this one because it was available in 3D. My first Disney Digital 3d film. From the aspect the kids will enjoy the things that pop out at you. This film has a few of those moments water debris and glass. Although it just didn't do it for me. The 3D in this film didn't enhance the film or astonish me. Thus it ultimately feels like a gimmick and will until a certain film that is planned to be released in the near future apparently plans to change that. I'm not saying it wasn't well done I just expected more.The film is mixed animation and live action. The animation is obviously the rodents and insects while the cast is formed of Hangover star Zach Galifianakis Will Arnett and Bill Nighy. Galifianakis is really timid here and Nighy does his whole British thing while Arnett plays the GRated version of an Ahole. Nothing memorable and the kids won't care about these people. They want to see the funny guinea pigs do funny things. Yet in the theatre I was in which was full of kids had hardly any laughs. That's not to say they won't enjoy themselves because the film is entertaining. It's just not that great a comedy.The voice acting is great Sam Rockwell plays Darwin the lead commando. Tracy Morgan is Blaster if anyone has seen him on 30 Rock it's the same here. Penelope Cruz is the female character who toys with the boys on which one she likes. Nicolas Cage plays Speckles the mole who is a tech whiz. In this film if you did not know it was Cage playing this character you would never know it was him. The voice is so different that is makes you scratch your head well done on all parts.The child favourite without a doubt is Hurley the guinea pig that our team meets in a pet shop. He has a bad case of flatulence and is the 'dumb' friendly character. He gets the most laughs which like I said wasn't many. Finally Steve Buscemi has a small role as a hamster and he plays it exactly as you would picture Buscemi to play it. The voice work from everyone was top notch but if I were to hand it to anyone it wold be cage for his transformation to the unknown.The animation is well done the final action sequence does feel like it comes straight out of transformers but it looks neat. The interaction between human and creature is still noticeably fake even after all these years they can't seem to perfect this. Since this is a Bruckheimer film you know there has to be nonstop action. This involves car chases left right and centre covertoperations and battles with giant creatures. The film is fuel injected to the bone with this. There are moments here and there to slow everything down yet they are extremely short and don't seem to do much to create conflict for the characters. When the guinea pigs are told they aren't special they get doubt themselves this lasts all but one scene because in the next they get a pep talk and are back to the chase sequences.The plot is one that we've all seen before. Unlikely heroes stopping someone from world domination. So don't expect anything new in the story department. The reveal at the end is lame and predictable the whole bad guy plan is extremely far fetched and doesn't make sense. Although if you're expecting this film to make sense I guess you're in the wrong theatre. These are talking guinea pigs after all.The film is entertaining and the kids will most likely enjoy it. It does seem like a typical Hollywood kid flick and it is exactly that. There's no life lessons learned and by the end of the film your kid will want a new pet.".

It will not win any Oscars and it is far from the best film of the summer but I was pleasantly surprised going in with low expectations. The entire first half of the film starting with the raid on Saber's mansion and continuing with the FBI's termination of the guinea pig project is just enjoyable from start to finish. It has imagination flavor and everything you could expect from something made for kids but partially geared at adults. It knows its audience and while it throws a lot of technical jargon at the audience it stays firmly within the realm of straightfaced fantasy even as we absurdly view guinea pigs taking part in flight simulators and parachuting off rooftops.Even the characters obvious archetypes as they are seem somewhat well thought out and put to screen. Darwin is the noble leader never wavering from his goal. Blaster Tracey Morgan is the wiseass clown of the group prone to being gutsy and showing off. Juarez Penelope Cruz is the sexy lady of the group complementing the attitudes of both guys with an unparalleled levelheadedness. And then there is Speckles an almost totally unrecognizable Nicolas Cage a mole with some serious computer skills. Yes I realize I just described the personalities of CGI rodents but these early moments of the film make any cynically minded film fan wonder why they doubted this insane idea for a movie in the first place.But as the second half begins with the team stuck in a pet store alongside chubby farting guinea pig Hurley Jon Favreau and zany bipolar hamster Bucky Steve Buscemi the film comes to a screeching halt. Yes the entire plot of trying to stop Saber continues but for some reason perhaps due to the general audience the film is directed to the film becomes enamoured with the concept of family. While this should not be a problem it totally chips away at almost everything that has come before it. The audience understands the ragtag team has a special bond together it does not need a batch of no less than six writers to tell us this. It makes for uncomfortably boring scenes and horrendously bad dialogue. Some of the silly oneliners are comically bad enough and rip off classic lines from actions movies like Die Hard and Raiders of the Lost Ark for the mere fun of it but the forced dialogue about not having a real family is just downright atrocious. It slows the film's pace down far too much and it barely picks up afterwards. And an action movie like this especially coming from the Jerry Bruckheimer camp needs to be fast paced.What I also found a bit off was the comedy. I was expecting the film to be filled to the brim with juvenile laughs but even they are conspicuously missing. The crowd of children laughed at the obvious moments like the irritating Poop in his hand! bit from the trailers but they did not seem to even budge at other moments that could have been funny but were not. I found it instead focused more on the action which includes the requisite Bruckheimer car chase. And while some of those scenes are handled more epically than I ever could have imagined specifically the chase scene others could have done with a bit more work. The sheer amount of ballstothewall action is still rather impressive for a kid's movie.The CGI for the most part is actually very well done. In any scenes involving humans who are not Galifianaskis the guinea pigs look incredibly fake and obviously not real. But when they are interacting with each other their gear and even the setting around themselves they are incredibly lush and believable. Some scenes look so advanced that it becomes frightening to think these animals are not the least bit real. Their hair moves in the wind gets soaked in water and dries just as fast and their noses twitch incessantly. Their movements against the CGI appliances that inexplicably turn the movie into Transformers III near the end are a bit questionable but for the majority of times it is very well done. Seeing it come to life in 3D is one of the better presentations this year outside of the breathtaking detail of Coraline and sheer wonder of Up and wowed me more than I thought it would.While none of the real life actors really gets a moment to really make something of their character aside from Galifianaskis who does a total 180degree turn from his offthewall socially inept performance in The Hangover the voice acting is stellar across the board. Everyone puts an excellent amount of effort into their characters and really make them sound alive and real. I think Rockwell and Cruz could have done a bit more but the almost totally unrecognizable Cage adds yet another character to his bizarre resume.GForce will not please everyone but its imaginative attempt at originality makes it a worthwhile film to watch. It has some great action pieces and some really good CGI. With some massive story tweaks and a bit more comedy it could have actually really astounded me. But as it is it's still better than Transformers.610.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have to hand it Jerry Bruckheimer is there anything this man can't do? I never thought he could pull off a family animation film and he has without a flaw. 'GForce' Disney's new animated 3D movie experience is a wonderful and fun film that kids as well as parents can enjoy. My wife who is in her 40's loved it and laughed intensely throughout the film particularly at Tracey Morgan's guinea pig character 'Blaster'.The story is about a team of specially trained secret agent guinea pigs that take on a mission for the US government. They're dispatched to stop a diabolical billionaire who plans to taking over the world with household appliances. A bit ridiculous right? Yes but it's made for infants.The voices here are top notch except for Penelope Cruz who seemed uncomfortable voicing animation. I always have thought that is a talent very different from being in front of a camera and not everyone will equate their onscreen performances with their offscreen performances. Tracey Morgan was the highlight but it was Nicolas Cage who surprised everyone by changing his voice for the mole character 'Speckles'. The voice was unrecognizable. On a interesting note at a press conference Cage spoke about how his kids didn't know he voiced the character and the same goes for all his work because he wants to shield them from his celebrity. Essentially he implied that his children have no idea he's a big time Hollywood superstar and will do everything from them ever knowing. Interesting huh? The 3D experience was the best I've ever seen and I'm not just saying that. Kids are so lucky that this film was made for them and not adults. The director Hoyt Yeatman a visual effects guru personally told me that he finished rendering the film just last week. Are you kidding me?! Not to get too technical but the reason for such an onerous task is the attention to detail. According to Yeatman the rendering took years with several hundred people working on it. If this isn't a labor of love than I don't know what is but it shows and we're all lucky for it.Overall I thought the film was funny visually pleasing and the pacing was never dull or incongruent. 'GForce' is made for kids but parents are going to be pleased applauding right into first place at the box office. Funny enough I asked Jerry Bruckheimer if there was a sequel in the works and he said If we fill the seats with happy customers we'll do another one. That's not going to be a problem.".

Things went wrong when FBI decided to shutdown the Unit making GForce members to crack down the classified case of Leonard Saber Bill Nighy.Written by Cormac Wibberley Marianne Wibberley tells the amazing story of Guinea pigs happens to be Secret Agents. Even tough the plot evolves with usual UnderdogPixar 3D story lines it really makes a mark during the second half. They managed to created unique personalities to their characters but at some parts I smelled Stereotypes.The voice actors were brilliant especially Penlope Cruz as Juarez the female Spanish Guinea pig Tracy Morgan as Blaster and Steve Buscemi as Bucky the Hamster. The much surprise came from Nicolas Cage as Speckles the StarNosed Moleand I don't know why he altered his great sound for this character I found it difficult to recognizance the original voice. All in all it was Sam Rockwell who wind up the show with his Heroic character Darwin.And the soul created for this movie by Trevor Rabin was stunning. The score really toned the action sequences and the story development.As a VFX student I enjoyed this movie from start to end it's a great fun movie I recommend it to everyone. In story wise and in technically wise it's eyecandy. I must say I never seen such a CGI execution in detail not even in Transformers such a brilliant work from director Hoyt Yeatman. He truly deserves some recognition. And also the legendary producer Jerry Bruckheimer teaming again with Walt Disney for his first 3D feature. By GForce he really marked his position again.I give this movie 10 out of 10. And I am waiting for the Sequel!GForce  Be the Force with YOU.".

	schema:reviewBody "The subject of child abuse is not a pleasant one and often the madeforTV dramas dealing with this subject present a onedimensional view. But this movie gets very deeply into the complex dynamics of a such a case. The story revolves around tenyearold Oliver Sam Bould who lives with his divorced mother Hannah Joely Richardson and her boyfriend Frank Jason Flemyng. The boy loves his mother as well as his father Martyn Martin Donoval who precipitated the divorce in order to live with his male partner Tom Ian Hart.The movie starts with Oliver having run to his father's house with a bloodied face. Oliver passes it off as his having been in a fight. Martyn is a medical doctor and takes Oliver to the hospital and finds out that his physical wounds in this instance are not threatening. But sometime later when Oliver shows up with broken bones in his wrist that he tries to blame on having been caused by slamming a car door on it Martyn checks it out and determines that the injury is not consistent with Oliver's story and he initiates court proceedings to get custody of the child. Frank and Hannah are very much in love and Hannah cannot believe that Frank is to blame for Oliver's injuries and she feels that Martyn is just trying a power play to get custody of Oliver and irritate her.This is a pretty straightforward setup but it is here where the movie becomes very involving. We come to understand why Oliver tries to hide the truth and stay with his mother even though he wants to be with his father. We get enough insight into Frank to understand why he behaves as he does and even though we cannot forgive his actions we see that he is not a total monster and we can even have some sympathy for him. And then there is the whole issue of whether homosexual men should be allowed to have custody of a child and that is explored in some depth. Martyn and Tom have the most natural homosexual relationship that I have seen in film but the relationship is not idealized. There are visits by social workers and a court hearing that is viciously brutal especially the questioning of Martyn about intimate details of his relationship with Tom.One reason that this story is so affecting is the superb acting by all concerned particularly by the young Bould. He is totally believable in conveying the traumas he experiences and you suffer with him.The saddest thing about the situation these people find themselves in is that none of them is really a bad person but they are drawn into circumstances that are psychologically damaging to all of them particularly the boy.This movie successfully treats many themes child abuse the farreaching and longterm effects of divorce sexual discrimination society's duty to children and the suitability of gays as parents.At the end there is no nice neat resolution in this honest and realistic film.".

I was held spellbound from the very beginning and as a mother myself wonder why the child's mother was not aware something was wrong with him. It was painfully obvious to me as an observer in just observing Oliver that something was not right. Did she honestly not know and then I would have to consider how close she truly was to her son or did she know and ignore which is so much worse. Can a quest for happiness or fulfillment even make us blind to our obligations to our children? I sincerely hope not.

But it has two things going for it that elevate the film above soap opera.The first is the performance of young Sam Bould as the abused child.  One of the best performances from a young actor I have ever seen without a trace of cutesiness mugging or selfconsciousness.The second is the character of Hannah.  Here is a deeply flawed woman who willingly puts her own son through hell and yet so skillfully written and played by Joely Richardson I sympathized with her throughout.  This is an extraordinary character and I was really impressed by the way she was handled.The one major flaw of this film is that the two gay men are wonderful parents and the straight couple are such awful parents...the film is so progay it verges on being antistraight.  But as stated above Joely Richardson's performance keeps you from making any easy judgments about Hannah.  She saves the film from treacly melodrama.".

But it has two things going for it that elevate the film above soap opera.The first is the performance of young Sam Bould as the abused child.  One of the best performances from a young actor I have ever seen without a trace of cutesiness mugging or selfconsciousness.The second is the character of Hannah.  Here is a deeply flawed woman who willingly puts her own son through hell and yet so skillfully written and played by Joely Richardson I sympathized with her throughout.  This is an extraordinary character and I was really impressed by the way she was handled.The one major flaw of this film is that the two gay men are wonderful parents and the straight couple are such awful parents...the film is so progay it verges on being antistraight.  But as stated above Joely Richardson's performance keeps you from making any easy judgments about Hannah.  She saves the film from treacly melodrama.";

	schema:reviewBody "Ordinarily I might have rated this film a bit higher but on a recent second viewing I overcame my annoyance with the dad's floppy hairdo and concentrated on more important aspects of the drama. In doing so it became apparent to me that  as others have pointed out  an element of fullness in the main characters is frequently absent.That is especially true of the mother's character. I find no fault with the acting but with the writing. No sensitive mother I know of would ever tolerate seeing her child harmed physically even if it did mean giving up the illusion of total fulfillment as a wife. The only such instances of which I am aware that even come close are those involving equal physical abuse of both mother and child a condition that allows no sympathy or secondguessing at all for the paternal abuser.Similarly I find the otherwise brave but confused responses or nonresponses of the child somewhat contrived. Most children I know of that approximate age would be far more demonstrative or would act out their frustrations in such a way as to provoke a quicker catharsis. Those who do not will withdraw completely and become intensely compliant so as not to incite even greater violence which is an even worse reaction because as they grow older it becomes something that warps terribly their adult perceptions of who they are and the world around them.These critical elements aside I applaud the film for its obvious effort to address what are in fact very frequent and common marital issues in an adult manner. Most movies of this kind are quite simplistic working out a plot in which there are good guys and bad guys as defined early on. This one rises well above that level.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had reservations about a sequel to the cult classic Clerks. The charm of the first movie was how Kevin Smith relied on convoluted dialogue and effervescent characters to launch the movie. I was not confident that he could return to those roots after 12 years of success under his belt.Fortunately this movie does not disappoint. Smith's trademark witty dialogue is ubiquitous as ever. The characters argue and rant about meaningless topics with the same intensity as family members faced with the decision to pull the plug. O'Halloran continues to portray Dante as the hapless slacker who simultaneously makes us feel sorry for him and urges us to smack him for not doing anything about his circumstances. The latter feeling is embodied by Anderson who plays the irresponsible malcontent Randall. Fans of the first Clerks movie will be amused by their continued antics. One of the new characters is Becky played by Rosario Dawson. Dawson performs admirably making us fall in love with the free spirit who took a wrong turn in life and ended up managing a Mooby's restaurant. Becky provides a refreshing contrast to the stodgy and suffocating Emma played by Mrs. Smith. Emma appears a bit too onedimensional but her purpose as Dante's fiance is clearly to show yet another disappointing facet of Dante's life. Another new character is Elias played by Trevor Fehrman. Elias's role is a bit overthetop as the hobbitobsessed geek whose life is enriched by the promise of a liveaction Transformers movie. The flaw is that Elias is too repressed and weird and cannot garner much sympathy from the audience. This might be Smith's intent as we enjoy a little schadenfreude every time Randall torments him.The story is fairly basic and picks up where the first movie leaves off. Dante and Randall seamlessly move from the end of Clerks to the beginning of Clerks II. This may seem sad since they are now 30somethings working as clerks and that is intentional. The sequel shifts the focus from young clerks trying to determine what to do with their lives to clerks approaching middle age trying to figure out why they're still in their deadend jobs. The story of Dante whining about his life and Randall putting him in his place is rehashed from the first movie but with a sudden afflatus Dante is finally able to do something about it.The humor is still strong with Kevin Smith as he throws ridiculous sight gags at us in between the labyrinthine dialogue about Transformers Star Wars racial slurs blogs and life in general. Fans of Kevin Smith naturally will enjoy this movie and do not need to fear that he has sold out. It's hard to say if newcomers will enjoy the movie. If they are into the humor of the movie then they logically should already be aware of the first Clerks as well as Dogma and Chasing Amy. I can only suggest for the moviegoer who is unaware of Kevin Smith's credentials to go rent Clerks. If the story bores you then Clerks II probably won't appeal to you though there are more sight gags that may appeal to some audiences. Those who are easily offended are also urged to stay away as this movie contains scenes of profanity bodily fluids and for most people sexual deviance.All in all it is a solid movie. It has a few pacing problems or did at the screening but nothing that negatively impacts the movie. Some scenes are utterly ridiculous but it is par for the course for this type of movie.".

	schema:headline " CLERKS II  A great conclusion to the NJ saga!";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie was everything I hoped it would be. It is especially or maybe even primarily for fans of Kevin Smith's ViewAskewniverse. And yes it's in color...mostly. Also there was no subtitle...it was titled simply CLERKS II...no the second coming or the passion of the CLERKS.I don't want to hit any spoilers this soon before the movie comes out but the general idea is that it is a coming of age story for the Gen X slackers who finally in their 30s find themselves not having advanced very far in life careers personally or even in general this is primarily Dante's role anyway. He decides due to some things beyond his control to FINALLY move on grow up get married and leave Leonardo New Jersey and its band of bad influences behind.Randall of course is not so keen at his only friend leaving NJ is perfectly happy living with his parents and doing as little as possible and a good part of the movie is spent on Randall challenging Dante's decision and exploration of their friendship.Now this may sound like some kind of melodrama BUT IT ISN'T!!! That basic story is weaved between the plot devices smart dialogue and gritty or pushing the limits humor we come to expect from Kevin Smith.There's Jay and Silent Bob of course who have a minicharacter arcgrowth experience themselves Jason Lee in with an all new character for one short scene I think this is his 5th new character in Kevin's ViewAskew franchise and Ben Affleck with a mercifully brief one or two line cameo. Jay and Bob's antics are always a great break from the other action never an intrusion even when they are TRYING to intrude by making asses of themselves literally in the background of the primary action.Plus a couple of new characters a crew member at Mooby's a McDonald's type fast food joint named Elias who is a very religious naive counterpoint to Randall's ruthless and jaded personality and therefore the butt of many jokesgags. His and Randall's comments regarding Lords of the Ring vs Star Wars are priceless and vintage Kevin Smith.Another new character Becky is played by Rosario Dawson who is the manager at the same restaurant. She plays the part of the good female friend who depends on Dante and challenges Dante to consider if he really wants to settle for a girl who is merely tolerable.As with the first CLERKS this movie pushes the limit of what can be put on film and actually get released in theaters. I hope the more controversial parts make the final cut because I think the shock value that makes you say NO THEY DIDN'T! is a valuable part of the equation and expected from this film franchise. Without giving anything away there are particularly two of the films ongoing jokes one having to do with bestiality the other in which some very NONPC racial terms are used REPEATEDLY including the Nword. No one else has the guts to address these issues and make them funny. 'Cept Kevin Smith.Finally the movie really does have a story without being preachy we're treated to known characters without it being a nostalgiafest for instance Jay and Bob are in their signature places in front of the Quick Stop but Jay utters not once Snootchie Bootchies...but not to fear he finds a NEW way to crack us up...Bob's discovered a way to keep Jay's mind off of drugs. Fans of Jay will NOT be disappointed.And the movie goes through an interesting story arc with surprises and twists resulting in a satisfying ending.I'm concerned that the more risqu scenes might have to be neutered for ratings' purposes hopefully not. If so they will be on the DVD for sure. I can say that even in very conservative KC the audience laughed A lot no one walked out during the most offensive part and everyone seemed to really enjoy the edgy wit smart dialogue as well as the bathroom humor that kept the film at a fun pace.EDITI've since read that 3 people walked out which isn't bad from an audience of nearly 500 and with a movie this edgy. I guess I was enjoying myself too much to notice the walkouts!The movie is also more realistic than some of the other View Askew movies more like Clerks obviously. None of the comic book type stunts like in Mallrats Silent Bob's batman utility belt and flying around with a cape or Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back with the fake lightsaber scenes and flying on the bicycle through a wall and not getting hurt or all the special effectsmythology and divine interventions of Dogma Alanis Morisette as God appearing at the end to save the world. There are no scenes to groan at and think ah right like that could happen. These characters are real and real things happen to them no special abilities creatures from the underworld or new age messiahs. Just real people that many of us can relate to.In closing...don't take your grandmother to this movie. It is full of obscene language profane concepts drug references unnatural sexual references etc. Unless you know your girlfriend is hip and not easily offended test her with a DVD of CLERKS first to see if she gets the humor.Otherwise get a gang of friends go to this movie and get ready to laugh your freakin' BUTT off!".

	onyx:emotionText "This movie was everything I hoped it would be. It is especially or maybe even primarily for fans of Kevin Smith's ViewAskewniverse. And yes it's in color...mostly. Also there was no subtitle...it was titled simply CLERKS II...no the second coming or the passion of the CLERKS.I don't want to hit any spoilers this soon before the movie comes out but the general idea is that it is a coming of age story for the Gen X slackers who finally in their 30s find themselves not having advanced very far in life careers personally or even in general this is primarily Dante's role anyway. He decides due to some things beyond his control to FINALLY move on grow up get married and leave Leonardo New Jersey and its band of bad influences behind.Randall of course is not so keen at his only friend leaving NJ is perfectly happy living with his parents and doing as little as possible and a good part of the movie is spent on Randall challenging Dante's decision and exploration of their friendship.Now this may sound like some kind of melodrama BUT IT ISN'T!!! That basic story is weaved between the plot devices smart dialogue and gritty or pushing the limits humor we come to expect from Kevin Smith.There's Jay and Silent Bob of course who have a minicharacter arcgrowth experience themselves Jason Lee in with an all new character for one short scene I think this is his 5th new character in Kevin's ViewAskew franchise and Ben Affleck with a mercifully brief one or two line cameo. Jay and Bob's antics are always a great break from the other action never an intrusion even when they are TRYING to intrude by making asses of themselves literally in the background of the primary action.Plus a couple of new characters a crew member at Mooby's a McDonald's type fast food joint named Elias who is a very religious naive counterpoint to Randall's ruthless and jaded personality and therefore the butt of many jokesgags. His and Randall's comments regarding Lords of the Ring vs Star Wars are priceless and vintage Kevin Smith.Another new character Becky is played by Rosario Dawson who is the manager at the same restaurant. She plays the part of the good female friend who depends on Dante and challenges Dante to consider if he really wants to settle for a girl who is merely tolerable.As with the first CLERKS this movie pushes the limit of what can be put on film and actually get released in theaters. I hope the more controversial parts make the final cut because I think the shock value that makes you say NO THEY DIDN'T! is a valuable part of the equation and expected from this film franchise. Without giving anything away there are particularly two of the films ongoing jokes one having to do with bestiality the other in which some very NONPC racial terms are used REPEATEDLY including the Nword. No one else has the guts to address these issues and make them funny. 'Cept Kevin Smith.Finally the movie really does have a story without being preachy we're treated to known characters without it being a nostalgiafest for instance Jay and Bob are in their signature places in front of the Quick Stop but Jay utters not once Snootchie Bootchies...but not to fear he finds a NEW way to crack us up...Bob's discovered a way to keep Jay's mind off of drugs. Fans of Jay will NOT be disappointed.And the movie goes through an interesting story arc with surprises and twists resulting in a satisfying ending.I'm concerned that the more risqu scenes might have to be neutered for ratings' purposes hopefully not. If so they will be on the DVD for sure. I can say that even in very conservative KC the audience laughed A lot no one walked out during the most offensive part and everyone seemed to really enjoy the edgy wit smart dialogue as well as the bathroom humor that kept the film at a fun pace.EDITI've since read that 3 people walked out which isn't bad from an audience of nearly 500 and with a movie this edgy. I guess I was enjoying myself too much to notice the walkouts!The movie is also more realistic than some of the other View Askew movies more like Clerks obviously. None of the comic book type stunts like in Mallrats Silent Bob's batman utility belt and flying around with a cape or Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back with the fake lightsaber scenes and flying on the bicycle through a wall and not getting hurt or all the special effectsmythology and divine interventions of Dogma Alanis Morisette as God appearing at the end to save the world. There are no scenes to groan at and think ah right like that could happen. These characters are real and real things happen to them no special abilities creatures from the underworld or new age messiahs. Just real people that many of us can relate to.In closing...don't take your grandmother to this movie. It is full of obscene language profane concepts drug references unnatural sexual references etc. Unless you know your girlfriend is hip and not easily offended test her with a DVD of CLERKS first to see if she gets the humor.Otherwise get a gang of friends go to this movie and get ready to laugh your freakin' BUTT off!";

What will Randal do without his heterolifemate? And speaking of heterolifemates what are Jay and Silent Bob up to these days? Brian O'Halloran and Jeff Anderson give stellar performances. Dante and Randal are back and in fine form. Trevor Fehrman is an excellent addition to the cast as Elias new coworker and perfect whipping boy for Randal. I absolutely fell in love with Rosario Dawson as Becky Mooby manager several times over. Jay and Silent Bob pop in and out without disappointment. I can't tell you how fantastic it is to see Jason Mewes looking healthy and in top form.Those looking for the intelligent wry and vulgar humor of Clerks will find it here. Can you top screwing a dead guy in a bathroom? Oh yes you can! Those who appreciated the heart of Chasing Amy will find that here too. Only Kevin Smith can pull off that combination.

There is no long monologues or actors stumbling over lines. There's this freedom in Smith's work that doesn't feel forced or attempting to impress anyone...but he impresses everyone with just the beautiful way of putting together his scenes.I wholeheartedly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone but especially those who are on the verge of 30 and the rest of your life. It definitely impressed me and touched me in a way that I didn't expect. It's a fitting end to the Jersey Viewaskewverse.Hopefully in 10 years they do another Clerks movie. I'd love to see these guys in their 40s. Randal and Dante are the most engaging of couples and Smith writes such an engaging story about friends in their 30s without pandering or compromising the vision of their piece.You will love it.

	schema:reviewBody "Clerks II Clerks II is a strong and poignant retelling of the story of when two slackers grow into adulthood. In many ways this is writerdirector Kevin Smith's most adult film in that we see four characters that we've grown up with over the past 12 years finally grow themselves. It opens on the final day of work for Dante who is finally getting up and out of Jersey with his fianc leaving Randal figuratively alone at Mooby's. Randal hasn't changed much over the past years and in many cases neither has Dante. Randal still wrestles with the customers in pitiful pop culture debates among them whether the LOTR trilogy is better than the Star Wars trilogy but this time around he has a new foil in a 19 year old gamergeek named Elias. The banter between these two is really funny especially when Randal tells him what he has planned for Dante's departure gift but you'll have to see the flick to find out what that is because it is too gross for me even to write. After a short stint in rehab Jay and Silent Bob have found solace in the Lord but this doesn't stop them from the dispensing with the drugs. Its odd to find that in the past decade it is Jay and Silent Bob that have changed the most true they still are up to their perverse antics such as ass rubbing on the window and the disturbing recreation of The Silence of the Lambs dance but they have grown more sensitive to other people's emotions and needs especially Jay. I haven't mentioned Rosario Dawson who gives a very charming performance as the clerks' boss. She brings a lot of presence to a slightly underdeveloped character. But it is Jeff Anderson Randal that deserves the full attention this time around. He gives an award worthy performance and delivers it with an astonishing amount of sympathy. He's loosing his best friend which though he'd never show it absolutely devastates him. The last 20 minutes are really tear jerking I know I was in tears and couldn't stop the flow. This film sort of keeps to the feel Smith created with Chasing Amy and Jersey Girl in that they lay the drama on thick and it almost works better than the comedy an oddity for Smith proving he too has grown as a writer. It isn't all drama though you do get great comedic scenes such as my favorite the porch monkey scene. I nearly had laughing tears during it. This is probably Smith's best looking film elevating it to the quality one would get whilst watching a really good episode of television. The camera even moves! And a neat little digital effect is shown at the beginning where the clerks' world seamlessly transforms from black and white to color I was shocked because I didn't even realize it was happening. This is one of Smith's best films and one of the year's best. I give it a high recommendation but I ask that you stick with it a little while because it moves at a slower pace then any of the other Jersey Chronicles it may take a bit of getting used to for some but this is a film that can not be missed.".

Smith really presents a dramatic tone with his directing a tone which is rarely set nowadays with most directors trying to match the style of Spielberg Hitchcock or insert successful director here and leave the movie looking like an impression Smith isn't afraid to use his own style. Most movies today are very cookie cutter but this is a refreshing change. What happened to directors just directing instead of trying to follow a formula to get rich? Smith is a genuine and modest filmmaker we can only hope that he keeps making movies and maybe he'll inspire more Hollywood directors to stick to goodoriginal material rather than weak big budget movies with all the latest young stars stinking up the screen.

So here is my contribution to wordofmouth advertising if you liked ANYTHING about Clerks I go see Clerks II. More of the same and then some and then some more. I have always been hitormiss with Kevin Smith and sadly the original Clerks was still my favorite of the group. And this movie is his best yet.In fact the only way I can appreciate Mallrats is to watch it with the audio commentary on. To me Mr. Smith is a lot funnier when he's just addlibbing. He said during his Q  A last night that they spent more time on this movie in preproduction than all the other movies combined and it shows. I am sure he was kidding but this movie is actually well written very well acted Rosario especially she is the topping that is going to make this movie sell and just well thought out in general. Good pacing especially with the sight gags one after another and the Decalogue that I've come to appreciate is priceless. Like the argument over which franchise has the better Return movie Lord of the Rings or Star Wars. Clerks II has become my favorite movie of the summer and I hope it becomes the sleeper hit of the summer because it is just that good. Oh and Kevin if you're reading this sorry about the title I am sure you pondered it. Maybe if you hadn't already used Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back?".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw an early screening of C2 and I must say that the flick is way better than anyone thought it would be. Mr. Smith is back in prime form and I would dare to say that this is quite possibly his best work yet. Granted this is not a film for everyone but if you are not offended by purposefully vulgar humor C2 should be on your must see list. Dante Brian O' Halloran and Randal Jeff Anderson are back with their humorous banter as if a whole decade had not gone by since we saw them last. DanteBrian is practically flawless as the straight man while RandalJeff is one of the funniest actors around and their onscreen chemistry is simply wonderful. The new guy Elias Trevor Fuhrman from Now You Know is a clever addition to the group while Rosario Dawson shines her irresistible charm on this little world of dysfunctional employees. The combination is a winning one and if you add an healthy dose of Jay and Silent Bob to the mix and even a musical number worthy of The Blues Brothers you have quite possibly the best comedy of the summer. This film is enjoyable even if you are not familiar with the original Clerks but it's even better if you are. To top it all off Kevin Smith shows us that he has learned from his mistakes and has now mastered the fine art of balancing comedy with truly heartfelt moments staying clear of the sappiness that sunk Jersey Girl. At the end of the film there were quite a few shiny eyes in the audience... bravo Mr Smith! You pulled off your best trick yet.".

Mr. Smith is back in prime form and I would dare to say that this is quite possibly his best work yet. Granted this is not a film for everyone but if you are not offended by purposefully vulgar humor C2 should be on your must see list. Dante Brian O' Halloran and Randal Jeff Anderson are back with their humorous banter as if a whole decade had not gone by since we saw them last. DanteBrian is practically flawless as the straight man while RandalJeff is one of the funniest actors around and their onscreen chemistry is simply wonderful.

Rosario Dawson vs. Veiny Cokehead Anorexic WashedUpPornStarlet looking girl doesn't really come off as a fair fight. But I'm being mean. Sorry.

	schema:reviewBody "A review of CLERKS II or any of Kevin Smith's films must begin with the obligatory reference to CLERKS. I liked CLERKS when I first saw it years ago. But since then the quality of Smith's films including my interest has dropped steadily since culminating in the god awful JERSEY GIRL. My interest was piqued however when CLERKS II was announced. I thought it was a mistake for Smith to do a sequel but since it was the one film of his I enjoyed I figured I would give him the benefit of the doubt.Nope. Mistake. Smith's trajectory downward continues unabated. I really wanted to like this film. However just because I wanted to give CLERKS II a pass and like it couldn't prevent the fact that it's a poorly written acted and directed film. And at it's very core it was created by a lazy auteur. Little attempt is made to create realistic dialogue believable characters or even a credible fast food restaurant.Taking place some 10 odd years in the future CLERKS II finds our heroes Dante and Randal played respectively by Brian O'Halloran and Jeff Anderson from CLERKS still slaving away at their dead end jobs at the Quick Stop and Video Store until a fire forces them to finally move on. Moving on however only means moving down the street to another dead end called Moobys a fictional fast food restaurant Smith resurrected from his View Askewniverse. The other cast of characters includes Mooby's manager Becky played by Rosario Dawson with an inexplicable crush on Dante Emma poorly cast Jennifer Schwalbach Smith's wife with an inexplicable engagement to Dante and goody two shoes employee Elias played rather bizarrely by Trevor Fehrman. Also the previously defunct Jay Jason Mewes and Silent Bob Kevin Smith make appearances as well. Also several of Smiths celebrity friends Wanda Sykes Ben Affleck and Jason Lee make uninspired cameos.So Dante is moving to Florida with his fianc Emma to live happily ever after. The movie takes place on his last day at Moobys. Dante's coworkers are unhappy with his decision to leave for the sunshine state for their own various reasons. Becky Dante's occasional lover secretly pines for him. Randal his long time coworker wants his best friend and foil to stay put in New Jersey. And the plot line that follows is in spirit if not in story a rougher version of JERSEY GIRL with the same sappy and forced sentimentality but with profanity and lots of sex jokes.I could accept the contrived plot if the film was funny but it really isn't. What worked in CLERKS was that it seemed fresh and original. Hearing essentially the same dialogue ten years on doesn't prompt laughter as much as it does boredom. Smith's characters have always been mouthpieces for either his sophomoric philosophy or his humor. But as I've mentioned they might work once or twice but seven films in? It's the same thing over and over. His characters sound exactly like the writer himself.This is most evident during a argument between Randal and Elias about Lord of the Rings vs. Star Wars. Randal in defense of Star Wars points out that LTR is merely a film about walking and proceeds to demonstrate. This is the same bit Smith used once on the Tonight Show a awhile back. Interestingly no one in Leno's audience really laughed at the bit a harbinger of things to come for CLERKS III guess.The acting is pretty poor and the ensemble cast comes across more as a group of friends getting together to play with some camera equipment they found then actual actors. The exception to this is Rosario Dawson and Jeff Anderson. Both do pretty well with the material they're given. As for everyone else well there wasn't much there. Trevor Fehrman plays Elias as an exaggeration and as such the character comes across as retarded and almost nonfunctioning. Either Fehrman isn't a very good actor or Smith didn't give him much direction probably a combination of both. As for Jennifer Schwalbach did anyone mention to Smith that since she's already sleeping with the director he didn't have to give her a part. Schwalbach isn't a good actress and comes across fairly wooden much in the same way that O'Halloran does and was clearly miscast. She looks much older then the others 40ish to their 30ish anorexic and with her bleached hair completely out of place. Not only did I have trouble believing that she'd be interested in Dante but also that she'd even live in New Jersey. The make out scene between Dante and Emma is one of the most unnatural love scenes I think I've ever scene. Awkward and unnatural for both the performers and audience.It's easy to pick on Smith for his weight or make other personal attacks but he may find the following the most insulting. Kevin Smith needs to either read some books on filmmaking or take some film classes probably both. I'm certain they have some good screen writing classes out in Los Angeles. Whatever indie rebel status he once had with the quirky gem CLERKS is now completely lost as he churns out one tiresome dud after another.Watching CLERKS II is like watching a very poor public speaker give a presentation. Just as you'd cringe at every stutter and nervous rambling with a poor speaker hoping they'll get better the more I cringed watching CLERKS II and hoped it would get better. It never did. Relief came only when it was over.The best way to sum up my experience with CLERKS II is with Becky's line upon entering the donkey scene It's disgusting and revolting yet I can't look away. Kind of how I felt throughout CLERKS II. However in the future as far as Kevin Smith's films are concerned I intend to look away.".

Clerks 2 is utterly dreadful. This is absolutely pathetic filmmaking. Smith has never been much of a visual director his films have always been slow and static. But now any flair for dialogue he ever had has gone. What you get are completely unlikable characters spouting foulmouthed chunks of awful bile. None of it is funny or fresh. It all sounds like the stuff a desperate fanboy might come up with. And I guess that's all Kevin Smith is at heart. He should go and work in a video store where he might amuse the odd customer with a speech about Lord of the Rings. His career in film should be over.Contender for worst sequel of all time.

Director Kevin Smith makes the exact same mistakes he made in the his first train wreck he wrote another terrible meandering script filled with his unoriginal opinions on pop culture and sex he cast the same fumbling and predictable actors once again he shows absolutely no consistency or vision as a director and he tops it all off with a haphazard editing style. Clerks II is awful from start to finish the product of a diseased mind with nowhere to go but down.To be fair I walked into the screening fully expecting to hate Clerks II like I hated Mallrats 1995 like I hated Chasing Amy 1997 like I hated Dogma 1999 and like I really hated Jersey Girl 2004. Kevin Smith is proof that anything is possibleas long as the Weinstein brothers have chosen you as a pet project. I just feel sorry for the notalent slackers out there who will watch Clerks II and think I can do that! Sure you can if Harvey Weinstein writes you a check for 5000000 and promises to have MGM distribute whatever crappy movie you produce. Yep any dream can come true. A decade of poor filmmaking hasn't made any difference in the quality of film Smith produces because he had no talent to begin with. There is no reason to pay good money to see this movie when you will eventually find it at Salvation Army for 0.75. Spend thirty seconds on any comic book forum or bestiality chat room and you will read material that is far more interesting and original. And if you randomly steal threads off those sites and cram them into an uninspired plot line then you will end up with Clerks II.Some of the high points include interspecies erotica Jason Mewes's butt crack vomit ass to mouth geekbashing and a punch line that goes You weren't the one who got mayo in her cooch. Or were those the low points?Rosario Dawson must've really been shooting up heroin in her Rent 2005 role to get dragged into this disaster. She is miscast because SHE CAN ACTUALLY ACT. She makes the rest of the cast look exactly like the amateur Jersey mooks they really are. Did you see the size of that cock gasps Dawson in a moment that pushes cinema backwards about 50 years. Don't be surprised if Kevin Smith now has to make his living at Comic Con selling autographs because making movies just isn't his bag.The notes I took during the film should be enough to keep you away Terrible opening. What is the opposite of funny? Dialogue couldn't be worse. It's like a vulgar commercial for ITT Tech. I keep waiting for someone to say 'Call now for your free brochure.' Awful.

	schema:reviewBody "Okay first thing's first of course it is not a patch on the original. It was never going to be. Clerks numero uno is probably one of the funniest films of all time and certainly one of the most verbally graphic too and it wouldn't have mattered had the laughter count in its sequel outweighed Smith's debut by ten to one I doubt there is any way even the most devout Smithite would have the same affinity to his latest project. So stop making pointless comparisons between the two. If anything a much more apt comparison to be made would be between Mallrats our director's sophomore effort. I simply came into this movie expecting to see Dante Randal et al do what they do best. Smith has returned to doing what he knows best following Star Wars loving comic book reading uberslackers as they f' up yet another establishment from the inside. Jay And Silent Bob are back too. Surely this wouldn't misfire as much as his recent project did. SurelyIt's been over a decade since their original incarnation and it is safe to say our trusty time wasters haven't been up to much. The first shot of the film is a black and white one of Dante opening the now infamous 'quick stop' to find it up in flames. Colourful flames I might add. It is by far the best gag in the movie. Along with best friend Randal he embarks on a new career in fast food where he shares a rather ambiguous relationship with store manager Becky Dawson whilst planning a move to Florida with fiance Emma Smith's real life muse Jennifer Schwalbach Smith.Everybody hated Mallrats but I loved it. Nobody watched Chasing Amy but I loved it. Some people wanted to crucify Kevin Smith after Dogma but I thought it was pretty darn enjoyable. So after a career with quite a few bumps and some pretty steep divots has the return to home really given Smith his best project since Clerks I? I'm afraid not. I have fond memories of these characters but then nostalgia does dent one's view occasionally. Perhaps going on the same holiday twice isn't always a good idea. Randal was the guy everybody wanted to be. He was rude to customers unashamedly embracing of all things unholy and was funny as hell. IN this movie he just comes across as a loser a really annoying git who can't resist running around and generally behaving like a five year old. Dante is still making the same stupid relationship blunders as before and most of the supporting cast do little to liven up proceedings  Trevor Fehrman's godfearing Elias only existence in the film appears to be on the receiving end of most of Randal's grossed out wisdoms whilst the various cameos Jason Lee Ben Affleck Wanda Sykes are all too brief to aid things along.The problem is none of this would matter had the script been dealt some killer gags. But there are none. I can't remember a single memorable line from the film and the only set piece that sticks in the mind is the bestiality sequence which is neither as intriguing nor as amusing as it sounds. The humour is too esoteric and verbose to appeal to Will Ferrell fans and too bland too please old Smithians. And it kills me to say that because I love Kevin Smith and feel he has been dealt an unfair hand in the past. This time however I feel he really has hit a bump in the road.".

Surely this wouldn't misfire as much as his recent project did. SurelyIt's been over a decade since their original incarnation and it is safe to say our trusty time wasters haven't been up to much. The first shot of the film is a black and white one of Dante opening the now infamous 'quick stop' to find it up in flames. Colourful flames I might add. It is by far the best gag in the movie. Along with best friend Randal he embarks on a new career in fast food where he shares a rather ambiguous relationship with store manager Becky Dawson whilst planning a move to Florida with fiance Emma Smith's real life muse Jennifer Schwalbach Smith.Everybody hated Mallrats but I loved it. Nobody watched Chasing Amy but I loved it. Some people wanted to crucify Kevin Smith after Dogma but I thought it was pretty darn enjoyable. So after a career with quite a few bumps and some pretty steep divots has the return to home really given Smith his best project since Clerks I? I'm afraid not. I have fond memories of these characters but then nostalgia does dent one's view occasionally. Perhaps going on the same holiday twice isn't always a good idea. Randal was the guy everybody wanted to be. He was rude to customers unashamedly embracing of all things unholy and was funny as hell. IN this movie he just comes across as a loser a really annoying git who can't resist running around and generally behaving like a five year old. Dante is still making the same stupid relationship blunders as before and most of the supporting cast do little to liven up proceedings  Trevor Fehrman's godfearing Elias only existence in the film appears to be on the receiving end of most of Randal's grossed out wisdoms whilst the various cameos Jason Lee Ben Affleck Wanda Sykes are all too brief to aid things along.The problem is none of this would matter had the script been dealt some killer gags. But there are none. I can't remember a single memorable line from the film and the only set piece that sticks in the mind is the bestiality sequence which is neither as intriguing nor as amusing as it sounds. The humour is too esoteric and verbose to appeal to Will Ferrell fans and too bland too please old Smithians. And it kills me to say that because I love Kevin Smith and feel he has been dealt an unfair hand in the past. This time however I feel he really has hit a bump in the road.";

I haven't read all the previous comments but enough to be aware of the spectrum they cover and that the majority are highly favorable. So far I've yet to encounter a Religious reading though this is at one level fairly obvious Our protagonist Antoine is seen first as a twelve year old he emerges again as a mature man not perhaps the 30 that Christ was when we next meet him in the bible Jean Rochefort was in fact 60 at the time with no visible means of support yet reasonably welldressed and well nourished. We have no idea and nor are we ever told whether he got his bac went to university or even gaol became a doctor lawyer or Indian chief. Nothing. But he does arguably perform a miracle by bringing true love into the life of another. I'm also slightly surprised that the feminists haven't jumped on this bandwagon and seen valuable ammunition in this story of a man who defines himself only in relation to a woman. In both French Le mari de la coiffeuse literally the husband of the hairdresser and English The Hairdresser's Husband Antoine exists only as an appendage to a member of the opposite sex in much the same way as for years women were defined only by THEIR husbands the doctor's wife the bus driver's wife or even just Eric's wife. Antoine makes the choice to define himself in relation to a woman  at that stage unspecified as an individual  when at the age of 12 he states unequivocally his desire to become not a train driver or a biologist but a hairdresser's husband a singular ambition whichever way you look at it. And so it comes to pass one day years later he walks into a hairdressing salon owned and run by a very attractive young woman Anna Galiena was 36 at the time 24 years Rochefort's juniorand proposes marriage within minutes. Now this is where in the cold light of day we stop and ask some very pertinent questions. I've already dealt with half of them  where has Rochefort been since he was 12  but now we must consider why an attractive and sensual young woman who as an extra incentive owns her own business has no man in her life none on the horizon and seemingly none in her past  though later she does tell Rochefort that she has known other men but none like him. In the interests of sustaining the fantasy on which this movie is predicated the young attractive business woman having initially ignored the proposal accepts in a cold matteroffact manner on their very next meeting a couple of weeks later and then against all the odds to say nothing of the age difference and Rochefort coming across as eccentric rather than the answer to a maiden's prayer they fall madly in love and enjoy an idyllic insular relationship rarely straying far from the salon and punctuated by Antoine's unique dancing to Arabic music. I've dwelt on what we might term 'realistic' aspects in order to illustrate the kind of obstacle the movie must overcome in realistcynical viewers before it can begin to exert its peculiar charm and I can only say that it is totally successful because even as these caveats enter your mind they are destroyed effortlessly by the strength and conviction of the two central performances and the strong support  including that of Michelle Laroque who somehow succeeds in suppressing her natural glamor and sensuality in what amounts to a cameo. Nothing can last forever as Noel Coward said so memorably in one of his minor songs and Mathilde's interest in the gradual ageing of regular customers verges on the obsessive until in one of the most romantic gestures in the history of film she takes her own life rather than face what she sees as the inevitable decline of passion and romantic love. Leconte shot this movie right after Monsieur Hire and followed it three years later after some TV work and a short film with 'Tango' another quirky story in which Rochefort by then 63 had a small role as a bellboy and I have no hesitation in adding my voice to the 'yeas' and scoring this one 910".

Asking nothing of us but acceptance as it plays out. Although it is relatively brief the short running time actually suits the material too. In an American movie Antoine would have lost her somewhere in act two and had to battle to get her back from a person not deserving of her before having happiness again. They might have thrown in a subplot centering around their best friends too. That's the way Hollywood movies are. Thankfully there are no contrived plot points or useless characters thrown about here. It's all a tight package. It's sad seeing things ending up back at step one as shown at the start but that does nothing to impact this foreign film I recommend to anyone with a sense of empathy.".

	schema:headline " A VERY charming movie but I disagree with almost every other review of it I've read";
	schema:reviewBody "Le mari de la coiffeuseThe director Patrice Leconte has a gift for helping us see people from other perspectives e.g. The Man on the Train. As in that movie Jean Rochefort is one of the leading characters.As there can be no one single meaning to a work of art so any movie will evoke many. But I strongly disagree with the narrative described in most other reviews of this charming movie thinking my own makes far more sense.Antoine a boy about 12 years old on the cusp of puberty enjoys the sensuality of physical closeness to the woman barber who cuts his hair his head often cradled against her ample bosom.His father has aspirations for his children and one evening at supper he asks this son what he wants to be when he grows up. He mistakes Antoine's answer groping toward his awakening sexuality and wanting to marry a woman barber for a lack of ambition. He disapproves of his son's announced goal and overreacts chastising him at the supper table and sending him immediately to his room. We see a hint that then both he and his wife wonder if he's been overly punishing.But instead of being hurt or angry Antoine takes further solace in his fantasy very much as Max did in quite different ways in the classic book Where the Wild Things Are. Whereas Max became king of the Wild Things the rest of this movie is Antoine's dream of what his future would be if married to a woman barberhairdresser.As in a dreamas in a 12 year old boy's simplified view of what it means to be a married adult and what an adult world is likemany parts of reality are missing e.g. it's as if he needs no job as if love and marriage happen in almost an instant as if his wife's life revolves only about him and his about her as if all their adult life takes place in his wife's barber shop where he's constantly present and as if his wife would of course prefer death to the risk of losing him. The somewhat bizarre little recurring dance which he does underscores the nonreality the dreamlike quality in this major part of the movie.This is an utterly charming movie of the world of a boy who is just coming into puberty trying to make sense of this delightful experience of being close to a woman's body.That's the meaning to me and this view is so very compelling I cannot believe the director intended any other.".

Antoine's first encounter with Mathilde is not exactly one that would endear himself to the young woman who is lovely in a mysterious way that is music to him. Eventually they marry and seem to live a good life until fate intervenes to separate them in a way Antoine didn't envisioned.This lovely comedy directed with great charm by Patrice Leconte is a joy to watch. The director was lucky in engaging one of the best French film comedians Jean Rochefort. As Antoine he is the best thing in this tender story of love and loss. Anna Galiena who plays Mathilde is perfect. Both actors are amazing in the film.The Hairdresser's Husband is an enjoyable love story that will please fans of Mr. Rochefort and Mr. Leconte.".

The film had some strange scenes and some strange viewpoints on life although I noticed much of the same secular and superstitious liberalness in many films from France. Unfortunately that secular viewpoint can lead to tragic endings as is the case in this story which finished in a shocking manner.However there is some nice humor in this drama too such as the funny dance scenes by Jean Rochefort.One thing about French films they don't need a lot of action to keep your interest.

	schema:reviewBody "This is another romanticdrama that only the French seem to know how to make. The key to these films isn't necessarily the story but the casting and its hard not to like a film that has Jean Rochefort. This is a story about a man named Antoine Rochefort who has always dreamed of marrying a hairdresser. The film starts with Antoine at the age of 12 and we see him constantly going to get his hair cut by the local hairdresser who is a widow and very bosomy. She dies unexpectedly and Antoine spends the next 40 years searching for another one that he can try and marry. Now he's 52 and he meets Mathilde Anna Galiena who is the new owner of a shop and during his first haircut with her he blurts out Will you marry me? She ignores him but three weeks later he returns and she says Yes. They get married and seem perfectly suited to one another. They rarely go out and don't seem to have much contact with the outside world. Mathilde gets depressed by listening to her clients problems and she is under the assumption that one day they're love will end.SPOILER ALERTOne day it starts to pour down rain and they make passionate love. Mathilde gets up and says she is going out for yogurt but she never returns. She ends up jumping into the ocean and drowning herself. Later Antoine finds a note that says she didn't want to go through the experience of not being in love anymore. Some have regarded this as one of Patrice Leconte's finest films but I have to think that The Man On The Train is certainly better and a lot more interesting. But this is a romantic fable that for the most part works. The best thing about this film are the two leads of Rochefort and Galiena. Rochefort is perfectly charming as the whimsy Antoine who spent nearly his entire life searching for the perfect hairdresser. And Galiena is of course beautiful and even though the gap in their age is noticeable we can still understand why she would find him enchanting. But this is far from being a classic and the films faults lie in the lack of character development. Who is Antoine and why doesn't he work? And why would a beautiful woman like Mathilde be such a shutin? She says she has no photo's of herself when she was younger but we never find out why. Leconte is content to just have these two get together and allow the viewer to witness their romantic life. The film ends on a very sad note and it has Antoine telling a customer that the hairdresser will be right back. Antoine has spent his life finding her and he's not about to give her up. Even though the story has many incomplete plotlines the film does work effectively as a romantic fable.".

It's probably the sexiest film I've ever seen even though there is no nudity and there are no sex scenes. Leconte perfectly captures the emotional power women can have over men and the joy of submitting to it.By the way I didn't notice until the second viewing of this film that there are several clues that Antoine' s father was having an affair with the voluptuous hairdresser who Antoine became imprinted on as a child. This is finally confirmed for me by the brisk comment that his father promptly died of a heart attack when told his son was marrying a hairdresser. See what you think.  The film is very French you can't predict how the plot will evolve and along the way there are little comments on relationships parenthood and the problem of explaining our existence. For me the most wonderful thing of all is the repeated theme of the North African music which Antoine dances to in a bizarre attempt to connect with sensuality and mystery. The final scene must be one of the most poignant moments in film history.".

This idea was produced by a strange interconnection of circumstances The woollen cloth of the swimming trunks knitted by his mother won't dry and chafes at the genitals thereby sexual desire is produced which focusses on Madame Sheaffer a voluptuously built Alsatian hairdresser that attracts him even more when Antoine succeeds in throwing a glance at one of her only meagrely covered breasts during one of his innumerable haircutting sessions.But sexual reverie comes to an abrupt end at least for the time being when Antoine discovers Mme Sheaffer dead on the floor of her hairdressing salon.In the long run the inexplicable suicide can't suppress his most ardent ambition. On the contrary his visits at the hairdresser's become a passion and about forty years after the terrible incident Antoine finally encounters the hairdresser of his dreams.Straight away he asks for Mathilde's hand without having talked much to her without having noticed a trace of willingness on her part to see more in him than a mere customer. Therefore she meets his audacity with chilly silence so that Antoine has to present his apologies and leaves the salon confusedly. Will his life ambition be doomed to failure?A couple of weeks later Antoine returns though a little timidly and it seems unlikely that he might dare to repeat his proposal. But quite surprisingly it's Mathilde who refers again to the unusual request and accepts it as if all she needed was a little bit of time to think about it. An almost silent relationship develops in which the two partners cling to themselves in an uncompromising manner offering hardly any space for the outside world. They experience their happiest moments of love when after the completion of daily work they lock themselves in the salon and spend their nights in states of euphoria.Such idyll would be perfect if there weren't any disturbing shadows falling on the radiant image. At the beginning they are nothing more than some apparently casual remarks made by Mathilde referring to certain customers for instance when she discovers on their departure that they walk more stoopedly than they used to. It is  progressing time that haunts Mathilde the fear to lose passion all of a sudden. Such an idea seems to be unbearable for her and finally leads her to a fatal inspiration...Again Antoine finds himself alone disheartenedly like after that first death. He has to admit that although life ambitions are generally fulfillable it is impossible to hold on to them. There is nothing else for him to do now but to be the guardian of a deserted hairdresser's salon in which although he may be able to wash the hair of the next customer he then can only tell him to wait The hairdresser will surely return.".

The film has a fairy tale quality especially with the way the film is lit with Mathilde looking positively heavenly and angelic but in a hyperreal way. It succeeds in that we truly feel the fascination Antoine feels and the adoration he feels for female hairdressers but without the film moving into any sort of deeper level the story fails to move the viewer. It stays on a superficial level and if anything the character of Antoine seems somewhat despicable the way he objectifies these hairdressers. I feel the film could've been much more powerful if the director decided to dig deep into his characters' obsessions instead of creating a shallow homage to objectifying hairdressers.But the cinematography was gorgeous and the dance sequences were nice.".

But then I remembered being warned by teachers about how love and theatre should be serious undertakings because they were essentially dangerous. Even in my literature class sexual morality was emphasized. Whenever a heroine was involved in passionate sex two things seemed to happen. First her lover left her. Second she killed herself. Tolstoi's Anna Karenina Flaubert's Madame Emma Bovary Shakespeare's Juliet and Zola's Therese Racquin all killed themselves. But perhaps because of my stagecrew teacher on the other hand who joked a lot  and was fond of Wagnerian music don't ask me why  I was familiar with Brunhilde who also killed herself. Her reason was religious though. The other ladies couldn't bear living in social disgrace but Brunhilde wanted Odin her spiritual father and the people who worshipped him to know that dying in love was as honorable as dying in battle. Patrice Leconte uses Brunhilde as a dramatic model in this movie The Hairdresser's Husband. Like the supernaturally powerful warrior Brunhilde Leconte's hairdresser Mathilde wields a knife. The point was sharp and true a fearsome cutting blade Wagner said. Mathilde kills herself differently than Wagner's Brunhilde did but the meaning is the same. Mathilda throws herself into a surging river from a bridge but surely this is meant to be symbolic because  there is a bridge in France called Brunhilde's bridge. Moralists will be completely confused by this movie and selfish people will resent it. I loved it and hope you do too.Mary Cadney Oklahoma City".

The thing about Chuck is he just LOOKS like a film star. Just driving a car he grabs your attention. The supporting cast here are less engaging. An afro and 'Hey man' too many perhaps. The writers seemed desperate to tap into 70s pop culture. A surefire way to date your film.The camera crew on this film must have gone straight onto 'Quincy' after they'd finished this. It's bizarre.

It goes from the brilliant main title theme to the woeful chase music when Heston pursues the leading lady. There's also the typically almost pinktinted blood.

Set in a postapocalyptic future for the audience of 1971 the film attempts to show a world populated by a single solitary man. Well a man and a cult of malcontented zombiemutantvampire beings. Robert Neville Heston is the lone survivor of a germ war that turned the population of the world into freaks. Based on the amazingly brilliant book I Am Legend by Richard Matheson the film shares most of the qualities of the book yet excludes the portions that make Legend fantastic.The idea of being the last man is intriguing. I used to fantasize about being Neville as a child probably not the healthiest thing for a kid. Neville has paradise but with the highest price possible. He can have anything he wants but no one to share it with. And come night time he must hide in his fortress away from the angry mob of mutants.The apocalyptic world that makes the first half so captivating is destroyed by the second half's plot device. I won't go into details for those who haven't seen it. However I will say the film starts to slide downhill from the midway point. But the lesser parts can be enjoyed as early 70's camp.Even with its faults The Omega Man is a great Scifi movie. It also gives Heston a chance to play his quintessential role of a man at the end of civilization. The film's weaknesses don't ruin the experience entirely. It is a film that myself and my friends talk about to this day despite the fact that most of my friends only saw it once or twice when forced by me.Related note I Am Legend was also made into the film The Last Man on Earth starring Vincent Price.

	schema:headline " Sci Fi Action At Its Explosive Best!";
	schema:reviewBody "This action packed and thoughtprovoking scifi drama has been one of my personal favorites for over 30 years. Charlton Heston found his definitive role here as the last man on earth a scientist fighting a single handed battle against hundreds of mutant creatures of the night. On the basic level this movie has some of the most explosive action I have ever seen. Heston is at his best as a bloodless technocrat a stone killer exterminating mutants with machine guns pistols grenades and his bare hands all the time giving off an icy air of detachment. Put Chuck up against Clint Eastwood or Charles Bronson and he definitely holds his own purely as a Seventies action hero. On the other hand this is also Chuck's best performance as an actor. The fact that he literally has the screen to himself for the first half hour allows him to do things he never did in his epic star mode. Watch him buy that used car making small talk with a rotted corpse. Chuck puts across so much loneliness and yet entirely avoids self pity as in thanks a lot you cheating bastard. It's a scream to watch the bigger than life Moses dealing with life's everyday hassles not in reality but in wistful fantasy. Then watch the WOODSTOCK scene in the movie theater. Here's right wing idealist Charlton Heston watching leftwing hippies dance and frolic. Here's the last man on earth watching huge mobs of people crowd up the world that is now empty. The ironies are razor sharp and Heston just lies back and lets the dialog work for him. Just to see just to really realize that if you have to be afraid to smile at someone if you have to be afraid to walk down the street what kind of world is that? Right? Note well the master's restraint. He doesn't sneer he puts much more sadness into the lipreading bit with a little selfloathing on the side. The dialog and situation are tailormade for Heston's cold decisive vocal style. It's not hammy stuff it's Heston giving you the same kind of chill Deniro achieved in TAXI DRIVER. It's the paranoid loner as tragic hero. This cold withdrawn stuff is right down his power alley and Chuck sends this scene into the upper decks. Once the movie gets started Heston gets superb assistance from Anthony Zerbe as the religious fanatic Brother Matthias. Zerbe is superb and the commentary on religious fanaticism is even more relevant today than it was thirty years ago. Then there's the sizzling racial subplot the killwhitey fanaticism of Brother Zachary striking far too close to home in 1973 but remaining as provocative as ever today. It's disturbing indeed to note the subliminal message of the interracial love affair  the nice white man is happy to take care of the black woman and her children but only after the assertive black man is dead. A movie that provokes entertains and combines scorching social issues with riproaring adventure THE OMEGA MAN is Heston's best. Nope  they sure don't make pictures like that any more.".

But I have this feeling the producers will take the easy way out.Boris Sagal the veteran television director who died under the most grisly of circumstanceshe walked into a helicopter bladehelms a brilliant adaptation of the book. Sure they changed the vampires into psychotic albinos. And they also injected a heavy dose of the Seventies counterculture. But the essential themes resist the tampering by the new screenwriters and remain solid story chestnuts. No one handles a weapon with such verve as Mr. Heston. He fires at random and generally hits something. Always a good approach in this type of movie. I enjoy his conversations with Caesar's bust in his Honky paradise. The sculptures and paintings on the walls are actual reproductions of the immortals they represent. Also check out the art work on the back of Dutch's jacket. It packs a wallop. Ron Grainer's score is legendary and has a elegiac feel punctuated by strange sounds from obscure instruments. The action scenes rival the best. Catch Heston's despair and loneliness when he jogs by a large office building along side a reflecting pool. Every scene is chock full of memorable lines and quirky bits of business. The bodies of the dead pop up randomly with a wild note on the soundtrack. There is a brief nude scene that for once fits into the plot. A standing ovation is in order for anyone left alive.".

It is a depressing  and in many ways thoughtprovoking  story set in a future where the human population has been wiped out.Robert Neville Heston is the only remaining survivor of a worldwide plague other than a race of vampiric mutants who come out at night. When the plague was first reaching epidemic proportions numerous scientists were given serums to try  Neville was the one who got the correct serum but he never managed to get back to HQ in time to report the good news. Most of the world's people went on to be killed by the plague but those who survived have evolved into lightsensitive mutants. Every day Neville drives around the empty streets of LA scavenging for food fuel and useful objects every night he returns to his ultra highsecurity house from which he fends off the creepy minions who come out to taunt him and perhaps one day kill him. The mutants are led by Matthias Anthony Zerbe formerly a TV newsreader now an antitechnology crusader who encourages his followers to destroy the scientific and technological items they find as he blames meddling scientists for ultimately decimating the world's population.What's so chilling about The Omega Man is that Neville is gradually shown to be the real mutant. He is the only man left from the world as it WAS Zerbe and his mutant hordes are the evolutionary creatures of the world as it IS. Distressing as it is The Omega Man is saying that in the event of a worldwide catastrophe human life would find a way to prevail but the remnants of previous human life might need eradicating first. From the sensational opening  in which Heston screeches his car to a halt on an empty street and starts shooting at an unseen being in a skyscraper  to the climax which is simultaneously happy AND sad The Omega Man constantly raises questions and manipulates our fears. It has weaknesses  sometimes the metaphors and morals are too heavyhanded parts of the film are slowgoing with an excess of talk which merely goes over plot details already mentioned there are dated elements music decor costumes vehicles slang speech which deny the film its topicality over 30 years on.

I cried and cried when Neville died. Even now when I watch the film the bleak feeling which runs as an undercurrent throughout never ceases to move me with the tragedy of the ending.This was Heston's best in my opinion even surpassing Planet of the Apes and many times more entertaining than the dreadful Soylent Green sorry but I really didn't like that one. I really believe that the films you see when you are between 12 and 16 remain with you forever because its the most impressionable time of your life. At least it was for me.

	schema:reviewBody "Charlton Heston just has that presence that arrogant demeanor where he screams at the world that doesn't understand what is going on. Some might think it becomes annoying but it actually works very well in this movie. The Omega Man is actually a unique little look at the world which here is populated by one man Charlton Heston. For a Science Fiction movie this movie is pretty deep. He is combating a group of zombies that seek to kill all humans.The zombies think that the human beings and their machines have caused the world to go into disarray and that because of it the humans must be destroyed. While the zombie types are evil they make some sense after all the reason they were zombies are on account of germ warfare. The movie is surprisingly effective for a movie with a 70s wackadum soundtrack and manages a lot of thrills the oldfashioned way through no special effects.Charlton Heston also manages to be an interesting character. He seems to be a man in a bit of a conflict a military man who has no choice but to defend himself but also a scientist an imminently intelligent man who seems weary of all of the fighting. He goes through the streets of Los Angeles with all of the products in all of the stores available to him for free. After all who's left to charge him? He seems a little crazy and he probably is after all he has gone years without sex that would drive a lot of men crazy. The action sequences in this movie are cool. There isn't any karate no Matrix slow motion just beating people up and a cool motorcycle ride through Dodger Stadium where Heston escapes execution as does Reggie Jackson haha. I digress.Germ warfare was something far ahead of it's time. The black and white context of this Science Fiction movie also adds a great dimension to this film. The symbolism of the ending where Heston is essentially crucified saving mankind is appropriate though some will find it silly. This isn't an Oscar winner but this is a fun little Science Fiction movie that will make you think.".

	schema:reviewBody "Yes this film is dated. However I respectfully submit that Mr  Mrs Corrington with input from Seltzer Sagal  Heston knew that most visions of the far future are going to appear deficient with the passage of time. See Soylent Green. Accordingly they set the film in roughly the same time period that Matheson used in I Am Legend. In the novel the story covered the period of 1975 to 1979.In this way the 1971 film is best viewed as a kind of alternative reality for the way American culture was evolving in the turbulent late '60searly '70s. When so viewed the film is not only clever but is really inspired.  SPOILER ALERTMatheson's concept was to try to use science fiction to give some credibility to the vampire legend. That had been tried to a point in House of Dracula when the scientist isolated a microorganism that had infected Dracula. Matheson went further and in so doing overextended the premise. The novel is very poignant in parts. However its primary problem is that tried to create a kind of moral equivalency between Neville and the vampires. That weakened the strength of the narrative. In the novel Neville drank canned tomato juice like the vampires drank blood? Parts were just silly vampire women disrobed to lure Neville outside after dark the head vampire resembled Oliver Hardy. By the end Matheson was apparently trying to persuade the reader that the vampires were just an alternate form of life infected with vampirus that was just trying to survive and deserved pity. For in different circumstances normal is relative and Neville became the fearsome legend for the new breed of humanity i.e. he became the new Dracula. Not so for the 1971 concept no relativism here. The world war to which Matheson only alluded was made explicit. Neville became a highlevel military scientist who better to have access to a potential vaccine? not Matheson's layman who was trying to teach himself about microbiology.The victims of the virus became vicious homicidal collectivistic antitechnologists beyond reason and compromise. Colonel Robert Neville US Army Medical Corps became the object of their fury. His antagonist Jonathan Matthias TV newsmanpundit adept at influencing an audience. Media Monster. He is the fallen one who creates the Mansonesque Family rejecting all traditional American values. It is the counterculture. Colonel Neville by contrast is the establishment. Harddrinking exceedingly wellarmed thank you NRA! and not averse to zapping the zombies. However he is compassionate and enlightened. He falls for an AfroAmerican woman the late Rosalind Cash and tries to help her Heston also marched for civil rights in the early '60s with Rev. King.By the end we realize that He is the savior. If we partake of His blood we will be saved. Christians call that the Eucharist. Ultimately he sacrifices Himself for the good of humanity so that the normal world America will be reborn. The little girl survivor senses it He is God or at least a man chosen to be God's agent on Earth. He is of course also a soldier one who is willing to lay down his life so that others might live. No relativism here.Very nice fusion of ideas Mr  Mrs Corrington. You took Matheson's basic story and made it much better. Neville became the legend he deserved to become. The Ultimate Hero.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1977 the American scientist and colonel Dr. Robert Neville Charlton Heston is the last man on Earth. All the human race died or became mutants due to the use of biological weapons in a war. During the war Dr. Neville was researching an experimental vaccine and in a flight to a hospital to use his latest experiment the pilot of his helicopter died and the helicopter crashed. Dr. Neville used the vaccine on himself and it worked making him the last survivor of human race. The race of mutants selfcalls 'The Family' and is leaded by the fanatic Matthias Anthony Zerbe in the middleages standards without the use of any facility of the Twentieth Century. Dr. Neville finds some other survivors and intends to use the anticorpus of his blood to prepare vaccines for them. The apocalyptic story has a tragic open end.Yesterday I saw this movie maybe for the tenth time. In my opinion it is one of the best Apocalyptic SciFi movies of the 70's together with 'Soylent Green' when the world had the cold war to threaten and the population had a great fear of a biological weapons. In Brazil 'The Omega Man' has not been released on VHS or DVD and I have a VHS recorded from the open Brazilian TV in the 80's dubbed in Portuguese with a terrible image but what else can I do to see this movie if the distributors and the cable TV do not show interest to release it in my country? For persons of other native languages like me I would like to explain the original title of the movie. In accordance with 'The Heritage Illustrated Dictionary' omega is not only the 24th and final letter in the Greek alphabet but also means the ending the last of anything. I hope that Tom Cruise does not spoil this magnificent story since I heard he had the intention of preparing or spoiling a remake. Remake of good movies should be forbidden! My vote is nine.Today 06 September 2006 I have watched The Omega Man again now in the original language.Title Brazil 'A ltima Esperana da Terra' 'The Last Hope of the Earth'".

Admittedly it's now more campy and dated and has some unintentionally funny scenes but that tends to simply add another dimension to the entertainment value.  Great period detail and Charlton Heston in fine form.There have been rumors of a remakerevision of the film actually of  the source novel I Am Legend by Richard Matheson.

I've encountered enough people over the course of my 41 yrs who perk up at the mention of it to be aware of its place in a lot of our memories. This has been satirized on the Simpsons which proves it has embedded itself in the national pop culture consciousness. Anyone who has read the book its based on the incredible I am Legend by Richard Matheson knows that this film has very little in common with it beyond its initial premiseand even that is not followed too closely. All of the criticisms of THE OMEGA MAN are valid it is very dated and not at all scary or intense and some of the stunts and special effects are laughably ludicrously cheesy. The villainswho should have been more terrifying than even Romero's zombiesare just crazed albino hippie Luddites and the last half of the film once Chuck hooks up with Rosalind Cash and the kiddies is really a let down. But the scenes that open the film of Heston hefting a coollooking submachine gun while decked out in Austin Powersstyle finery staring in angst at an old calendar or losing his mind for a moment hallucinating the sound of telephones ringing in the deserted city still pack a punch. This was the second movie after 1959's THE WORLDTHE FLESH AND THE DEVIL to successfully pull off the eerie effect of being the last living human being in a huge empty city. Both films established the visual motif of streets filled with blowing waves of newspapers and swirling trash.After years of seeing this on TV  a guaranteed late September or early October event every year for a few years on the local TV station during my Pacific Northwest childhood in the old Dark Age before cable TV and the videocassette revolution its nice to see this movie on DVD with a beautiful widescreen transfer. It looks and sounds great. As a child I always liked the music particularly the surprise party theme that plays when the villains make their first appearance.

Damn...he's all out of gum.The film is crafted well with a great score for a B film. I'd get it on CD if I could. Too bad IMDb doesn't list the soundtrack. HINT HINT IMDb...get the soundtrack listings!!!There are two types of people in this world those who like HestonOmega Man and those that don't. The former group consists of men and heroes  the latter mere Ethan Hawke apologists and Spice Girl fans. Don't be that guy. Be a real man enjoy vintage Heston";

And though Christopher MacDonald who play's Doyle's father is a real creep he is a great comedian as well and you just can't help to laugh whenever this guy is around uh...that's a good thing.This is the early part of John Hughes's transition into strictly doing family films. He passed the teenage films the brat pack series then films with slightly younger supporting and main casts Uncle Buck Curly Sue Dutch and then went straight for the youngestaged family film series Home Alone Baby's Day Out etc. The early part of the John Hughes family film series which started somewhere around 19891990 and continued into the early 90s are comedies that I still enjoy watching I haven't cared to watch many of his later movies because Baby's Day Out and Beethoven etc. just doesn't interest me. They had two great elements the social commentary though it tends to be repeated in many of his filmsscreenplays and the comedy element. Disappointed that his father Christopher MacDonald is in London on a supposed business trip which translates into a holiday with a woman instead of his son and won't be spending time with him on Thanskgiving spoiledbrat Doyle Ethan Embry decides that he doesn't want to spend the holiday with his mother either. They don't get along well especially considering he is more like a mirror of his incredibly obnoxious father while his mother Jo Beth Williams is a sensitive kinder woman who just wants to get along with her son. Don't worry 'Dutch' is on the case!Dutch Ed O'Neill is sort of a bafoon character as we see from the introduction at the party where he engages in something like a mini version of Peter Sellers in 'The Party'. But he's a goodnatured fellow with a heart of gold. He'd have to be to make a promise to Doyle's mom that he'd bring the boy home for the holidays Doyle goes to private school.It proves to be no easy task. Not at all. Since Doyle doesn't want to come home at all let alone with his mother's goofy boyfriend. Doyle despises Dutch because Doyle comes from major money Dutch works in construction and sees himself as a much classier person than Dutch who can get pretty gross when he wants...if only to annoy Doyle. But Dutch is going to do whatever it takes and it takes a lot not only to keep his promise to Doyle's mother but to try and get the tense little boy to lighten up and see that the world is not entirely against him. So there you have the typical elements of Hughest 1 social commentary via class divisions and 2 unecessary youth angst. With a guy like Ed O'Neill who even offers some great slapstick comedy you can be sure that you'll be in for a lot of laughs. This guy truly is one underrated actor.".

As in all of his films for the most part but to a certain degree even more so in this.  A gradual escalation from hateful to loving from cold to warm and from angry to happy.  It's most assuredly one of the best scripts ever written.I give it a 9 out of 10 10 being the highest.

	schema:reviewBody "I recently saw that this film was scheduled to air on TV.  Thinking to myself I really liked this movie I went to IMDb to see what others thought of the film. I was utterly surprised to see the mediocre score that was it given so I perused through the comments.  Almost all the comments listed praised this film as did I.  So why the low score? In the context of recent films such as Shindler's List The Pianist Gangs of New York and other heavies this film is quiet and unassuming. But should NOT be overlooked! I had never cared much for Ed O'Neill in his neanderthal 'Al Bundy' role but my opinion of him turned 180 after this film.  He conveys depth restraint humor and pathos without resorting to the caricature of his previous work.  And it is the chemistry between O'Neill and Embry as the spoiled prep school brat that carry this film so well. This is a charming unassuming film about growing up and first impressions. An excellent family film that will amuse the younger children and still thoroughly entertain the adults in the room.  All of this while reminding us to never judge a book or a movie by it's cover.6.5 out of 10".

	onyx:emotionText "I recently saw that this film was scheduled to air on TV.  Thinking to myself I really liked this movie I went to IMDb to see what others thought of the film. I was utterly surprised to see the mediocre score that was it given so I perused through the comments.  Almost all the comments listed praised this film as did I.  So why the low score? In the context of recent films such as Shindler's List The Pianist Gangs of New York and other heavies this film is quiet and unassuming. But should NOT be overlooked! I had never cared much for Ed O'Neill in his neanderthal 'Al Bundy' role but my opinion of him turned 180 after this film.  He conveys depth restraint humor and pathos without resorting to the caricature of his previous work.  And it is the chemistry between O'Neill and Embry as the spoiled prep school brat that carry this film so well. This is a charming unassuming film about growing up and first impressions. An excellent family film that will amuse the younger children and still thoroughly entertain the adults in the room.  All of this while reminding us to never judge a book or a movie by it's cover.6.5 out of 10";

	schema:reviewBody "Yet another movie were the antagonist takes advantage of the protagonist's mistakes and tries to make comical situations out of it but ending up just failing. It reminds me of Home Alone 2 were some of the falling scenes sounding like failed punches from a comic book movie. The iconic cracking of the nose and other stupid sounds. The only difference between this and Home Alone 2 is that at least Home Alone 2 was funny.I know I gave this movie two and a half stars but for the wrong reason. Let me just say that excluding Ed O'Neill I hate every character in the movie. The two and a half stars basically go to him since I'm a sucker to see him in movies and portray his funny middle class self. But this movie got on my last nerve in points.Lets stop and think about how many times we have seen this before let alone in a John Hughes movie. It's almost like they tried to continue Uncle Buck in points of the film. This movie is very hard to relate to seeing as this kid is spoiled and yet still miserable. This kid as an annoying smart ass tone to him which make you want to punch the kid. Plus with a sucker mother and a comical father he's not living royalty.Dutch Dooley Ed O'Neill has a relationship with single mother Natalie JoBeth Williams. Making a promise to his girlfriend he agrees to drive to pick up her twelveyearold son Doyle Standish Ethan Embry from his private school in hopes that the drive back they will become friends. I have to stop and note that Doyle reminds me of that bratty kid from Full House that had and elegant way of talking and just a certain way of saying everything in a knowitall way.Then....you guessed it. Doyle and Dutch have a less than brotherly relationship together. In fact there like two kids fighting over the front seat in the car. The one kid instigates Dutch or the guy who tries to have a relationship with the other one but in an unnatural way. Or like the guy who says ha ha I got the front seat. Doyle tries to be mature about it but yes in the wrong way. He says things in an annoying way just to be an instigator.This movie is not original at all it's the same recycled concept we have seen on the big screen and in real life. You know what will happen. The mom's got a new boyfriend the boyfriend tries to be nice to the kid the kid pulls juvenile pranks on the adult the adult takes no grown up charge towards it then they work it out movies over wasted 10. I think thats all the nitpicking I can do on this. In all honesty this isn't bad but I've said this before it goes in every way you would expect it. There's no uniqueness toward the movie.But I will go as far as saying it's a watchable John Hughes movie. But it doesn't live up to the other forgotten ones like Curly Sue Flubber The Great Outdoors and my second favorite John Hughes movie Career Opportunities. I also have to be honest in saying that I laughed in parts of this movie. Plus there were a few parts in this that actually stood out that when I look at the title Dutch I'll remember this movie.Starring Ed O'Neill Ethan Randall JoBeth Williams and Christopher McDonald. Directed by Peter Faiman.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film sort of reminds me of the film Over the Top without the sweaty men arm wrestling and smacking themselves to psyche up for their next match. This is a very good thing. This film is also a comedy and not an overly serious drama sorry but a travel film such as this should be a comedy rather than a sappy drama. This film does get sappy here and there but not as bad as that one. The reason I compare the two is because it has two men going after a military kid on behalf of the mother. Granted the mother was dying in Over the Top I still find the two similar. This one has O'Neil of Married With Children fame as the new boyfriend of a mom. He offers to go pick up her son at a military type school so that they can bond. Well things of course do not go as planned as you end up with a bit of a crazy trip. Though nowhere near as crazy as the trip John Candy and Steve Martin had in Planes Trains and Automobiles. The kid has a bit of a problem with his mom and worships his dad who is actually a bit of a stand offish type not really involving himself in his son's life other than the phone call promising he will be there for sure next time type. The comedy is rather good but it suffers from its similarities to the superior Planes Trains and Automobiles movie. You see some of the same jokes however they don't have the edge of that movie. Still it is a tolerable enough flick though they kind of made fun of it on Married with Children as the wife spots the movie on sale at a really low price an she kind of dismisses it completely. However I do not think it is worthy of that kind of scorn as it has some good moments Over the Top on the other hand deserves its scorn.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE WAGON IS NEVER AN EASY RIDE.In the wake of Paramount's enduring classic Lost Weekend 1945 comes this equally absorbing tale of alcohol addiction from Warner Bros. entitled COME FILL THE CUP. It is one of the best pictures of its kind thanks in no small measure to the presence of James Cagney who delivers a powerful performance first as a down and out alcoholic on the skids and then later as a reformed victim trying to sway others away from the demon drink. Produced in 1951 for the studio by Henry Blanke it was nicely written for the screen by Ivan Goff and Ben Roberts and was based on the novel by Harlan Ware. Beautifully photographed in crisp Black  White by Robert Burks it was directed with fine care and attention to detail by Gordan Douglas.Cagney plays Lew Marsh a reporter with The Sun Herald. But Lew has a problem. He drinks too much and his career is in tatters. Because of drink he can't hold down his job and is fired when he is five days late with a story. He becomes a hopeless vagrant. A dishevelled drunken bum staggering along the streets of the city waiting for the bars to open. Collapsing on the roadway he is taken to a hospital's alcoholic ward. On his release I hope I never see you again Marsh the doctor tells him he becomes acquainted with an ex alcoholic Charlie Dolan James Gleason who takes him in and rehabilitates him. Without ever drinking again he manages to secure his job back on the newspaper and after some years he is promoted to chief story editor. But now his boss Raymond Massey sends for him and asks for his help to stop his nephew Gig Young drinking. Reluctantly Lew takes on the job but faces a mammoth task.The acting is superb from the entire cast. Cagney in particular is simply brilliant and here gives one of his very best performances. The film's early scenes of him drunkenly making his way along the city streets are quite riveting and harrowing in the extreme. Excellent also is James Gleason and the always polished Raymond Massey but extraordinary is the performance from the illfated Gig Young here revealing a remarkable talent. The sequence where he goes cold turkey and madly rummages through his apartment desperately searching for an elusive bottle of booze is a stunningly profound and concentrated piece of acting. Gig Young quite rightly was nominated for an Acadamy Award for his efforts in the picture. Also of note is the music score which features an attractive piano concerto written by Warner's music supervisor Ray Heindorf and the eerie background score which was composed by the uncredited Max Steiner.COME FILL THE CUP is a great movie that hasn't dated at all since it was made and is just as vital pertinent and appropriate today as it was in 1951 or sadly perhaps even more so.".

My most vivid memory is about two particular scenes. The first is between Cagney and his boss Raymond Massey. When Massey virtually orders Cagney to sober is young nephew up Cagney replies can't be done . When the boss inquires why ? he is told that the drunk must first hear the sound of angel feathers . The feathers he relates is the fear of death. The other scene is the one in which Cagney meets the young nephew who's name is Boyd played by Gig Young. While completely drunk and laying down on a bed couch ? in Cagney's apartment the two men engage in some banter whereby Cagney keeps referring to his guest as Boydeee. The nephew having enough of Cagney's mispronunciation informs him that if he calls him Boydee one more time he will knock his block off! Cagney then informs him that he is drunk and that he will knock nobody's block off. This last line is delivered with a smile and style that only the great Cagney was capable of. Upon hearing Cagney's reply the nephew agrees with a smile of his own and then doses off to sleep. While watching the oncoming sleep Cagney's expression changes from a smile to a face of concern and something else. The something else may be angerdisgust and or fear. But whatever it is it in itself sets the tone for the rest of the film. And that look which once again only Cagney could deliver tells the audience that someone is in for a great deal of trouble and part of the trouble is that Cagney doesn't know who is in for the worst of it.".

Cagney has hired several former drinkers who are making a success on the paper and he thinks that Cagney is just the man to help straighten out his nephew Gig Young who is going down the same path. Young is a promising composer who has let his talent go to waste in a sea of booze.Two things complicate the picture for Cagney. First Young is married but separated from Phyllis Thaxter who used to be Cagney's girl. But also Young is now getting himself involved with Charlita a little chanteuse from south of the border who gangster Sheldon Leonard has put his brand on. And to top that all off Leonard is the target of Massey's newspaper.

Young lost in the Oscar sweepstakes to Karl Malden for A Streetcar Named Desire. The guy who should get some acclaim here is James Gleason who plays Cagney's roommate and sponsor in helping to kick the booze habit.

	schema:reviewBody "I consider it to be one of Cagney's best. A very entertaining film not merely a morality play complete with a good plot witty dialog and humor. In one scene the local crime boss Sheldon Leonard forces two alcoholics to drink whiskey at gunpoint. In an ironic twist one of the drunks deciding whether or not to quit the bottle in the film is Gig Young a reallife alcoholic who later killed his wife and himself. The difference between this film and most others is its' contention that the alcoholic must want to quit and that this desire must come from one's self. I nearly said antibooze film but that is not true. In it most of the characters are able to drink without becoming alcoholics just like in real life. Alcohol aside this is a classic crusading newspaperman versus gangster story of the 40s and 50s with music and humorous twists for spice. This is definitely one of my favorite films.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm talking about Raymond Massey as newspaper owner John Ives in my title but I'll get to that later.James Cagney plays Lew Marsh a hard hitting newspaper man who just can't stay away from the bottle. The last straw is when he comes back from a bender and starts to write a story that is five days old. His long suffering editor finally cans him. He is obviously well liked at the paper and he even has a best girl  Paula Phyllis Thaxter who also works in the newsroom.After he is fired Lew tells Paula to forget about him to go find a young healthy guy. Time passes and we see Lew staggering down the street looking haggard and dirty. He falls in front of a passing truck but is barely missed being hit. An ex alcoholic Charlie James Gleason sees all of this. Lew is taken to the hospital and tied down to a bed until he is past the DTs. He swears off drinking because he claims he heard angel feathers. Drunks may be running from life but they are running from death even more and this brush with death is what did it for Lew. Charlie an ex drunk himself meets him as he comes out of the hospital gives him a home and a job doing construction. A big test of soberness is when Lew sees news of Paula's marriage to the nephew of the owner of the paper he was fired from. He passes that test  barely.Then comes news he is wanted back on the newspaper. The owner himself John Ives Raymond Massey believes Lew has changed and gives him a second chance. Years pass  six of them to be exact  and then one day John Ives calls Lew to his office. The guy who married Paula Lew's exgirl has become a hopeless alcoholic and since Lew has had so much success himself and success with picking employees for the newspaper who are exdrunks that stay sober he wants Lew to help straighten out the nephew who is like a son to him  Boyd Gig Young.Lew says what the nephew needs are doctors and nurses. Ives is insistent on Lew being the guy to set the nephew straight. This is where my title comes in. Apparently Ives is a handson owner so he has got to know something about Lew and Paula being in a relationship years before. Lew could just not succeed on purpose to get Paula back  Paula and Boyd's marriage is already on the rocks or being around Paula that much could have Lew falling off of the wagon and being Boyd's new drinking partner. There is even an unexpected gangster angle thrown into all of this. How will all of this work out? Watch and find out.It's funny Cagney left skid marks on his way out of Warner Brothers after Yankee Doodle Dandy but that studio always seemed to have him pegged for the right roles. The stuff he did independently never seemed to work out and click yet Warner's put him in films where he made three of his best mature performances  this film Mister Roberts and White Heat and in all three he plays completely different kinds of guys and plays them well.As far as supporting performances here they are all excellent. Thaxter is lovely but demure here first the long suffering girlfriend of one drunk and then the long suffering wife of another. Sheldon Leonard is terrific as a gangster just shortly before he becomes the most successful producer in television. Raymond Massey is very good as gray character John Ives giving Lew a second chance at the paper years before he knows he'll even need him but when he needs him to reform his nephew he rather undoes that good deed by using it to propel Lew forward to do his bidding. And then there is James Gleason in a small but vital get wise to yourself kind of role that he had been doing in front of the camera so well for twenty years.The Lost Weekend it is not  but just barely. It does stress the point that alcoholism is a permanent disease one that the alcoholic is always battling. As Lew Marsh says One drink is too many and all the drinks after that are the second drink. Highly recommended if you can ever find it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Come Fill The Cup might actually be the first film to realistically describe alcoholism as a disease and the surprise here is how the story tackles the idea that no one can help an alcoholic get sober except the alcoholic himself. For Charley Dolan James Gleason the road to sobriety began when he heard the sound of 'angel feathers'. Lew Marsh James Cagney described it like more of a whirring sound when he took a peek into the void and realized that he was afraid to die. It's pretty unusual to get all of this kind of psychological insight in a 1950's Warner Brothers flick most of the time they were simply portraying the ills of society while allowing the viewer to make up their own mind about things. But here the story makes it fairly clear that there's really no cure for alcoholism and that most drunks have to hit rock bottom fairly hard before climbing back up.In Cagney's case his character probably made it look a bit too easy going cold turkey after five lost days in a drunk tank. A fired newspaperman he claws his way back to respectability with the help of friend Charley returning as a reporter at the SunHerald. Eventually he's asked by his editor Julian Cuscaden Larry Keating to get involved with the publisher's nephew a would be composer Gig Young who's having his own troubles with the bottle. Complicating things is the presence of Paula Copeland Phyllis Thaxter Lew's exgirlfriend now married to Boyd Copeland Young. Perhaps as a nod to Cagney's success in the gangster film genre the story introduces a criminal element as a result of Boyd's extramarital involvement with the girl of big time hood Lennie Garr Sheldon Leonard. I think the story could have been effective without the mobster angle as it kind of drew your attention away from the main plot but I guess it served it's purpose. A critical scene near the finale had the exdrunks facing down the thugs giving the good guys a chance to redeem themselves on a number of different levels.There was a fairly clever scene I thought about midway through when it became apparent that Boyd Copeland was on the way to staying sober. His only friend was a dog he called 'nameless' but through no effort on the dog's part he earned the name of Corky. That was a pretty insightful comment on an alcoholic's new found sense of self worth.At some point in the picture I was reminded of 1962's Days Of Wine And Roses another movie dealing with alcoholics hitting rock bottom and then trying to get straight. In that one it was a couple Jack Lemmon and Lee Remick that had to deal with their personal demons. Coming a decade later it's probably the stronger of the two stories but that doesn't diminish the effect that Come Fill The Cup will have on you. The story draws you in quickly and you find yourself totally engrossed in the characters making it's almost two hour run time breeze by pretty quickly.".

	schema:headline " Worth seeing just for Gig Young's performance alone!";
	schema:reviewBody "When I saw Jimmy Cagney in this movie way back in 1951 I thought it just a routine melodrama. Now of course it shines like a beacon of Hollywood craftsmanship Gig Young was nominated for an Academy Award  and fully deserved it! Normally a somewhat dull actor it's hard to believe he had such a convincing tourdeforce performance in him. Admittedly he gets a bit of assistance from makeup plus the atmospheric photography by Robert Burks but it's nevertheless an interesting and astonishingly credible portrait. In fact the film's strengths lie in its acting plus its atmospherically bleak low key film noir photography plus its punchy dialogue its racy direction and its colorful probing of the world of the alcoholic.True not all the acting is totally A1 Massey tends to overact and is somewhat unconvincing and Thaxter makes a somewhat colorless heroine. And the screenplay tends to be a bit preachy at times but it holds the attention nevertheless. What does tend to undermine our interest is the familiar premise that newspapermen are the salt of the earth. Why did Hollywood genuflect before newspapermen?

	onyx:emotionText "When I saw Jimmy Cagney in this movie way back in 1951 I thought it just a routine melodrama. Now of course it shines like a beacon of Hollywood craftsmanship Gig Young was nominated for an Academy Award  and fully deserved it! Normally a somewhat dull actor it's hard to believe he had such a convincing tourdeforce performance in him. Admittedly he gets a bit of assistance from makeup plus the atmospheric photography by Robert Burks but it's nevertheless an interesting and astonishingly credible portrait. In fact the film's strengths lie in its acting plus its atmospherically bleak low key film noir photography plus its punchy dialogue its racy direction and its colorful probing of the world of the alcoholic.True not all the acting is totally A1 Massey tends to overact and is somewhat unconvincing and Thaxter makes a somewhat colorless heroine. And the screenplay tends to be a bit preachy at times but it holds the attention nevertheless. What does tend to undermine our interest is the familiar premise that newspapermen are the salt of the earth. Why did Hollywood genuflect before newspapermen? The reason is of course that before TV became fully established as a household necessity newspapers easily stripped radio as the number one choice to feed movies to the masses.

	schema:reviewBody "Perhaps no other cinematic depiction of revolt against colonial rule is so detailed vivid and specific as the 1965 Battle of Algiers La battaglia di Algeri just reissued in a new print and having limited distribution in the US. It's a vivid and very specific recreation of the insurrection against the French in Algiers in the late Fifties that shows how the French systematically eradicated that insurrection. It's also a story repeated with variations in dozens of parts of the globe now as then. But as I'm not the first to note it's neither a partisan tract nor a user manual. It was therefore foolish of the Pentagon to watch it recently as if tips on how to control Iraqi resistance''terrorism' were to be found in it and it has been equally foolish of the Black Panthers or other revolutionaries to watch it seeking tactical information for their struggles. Those tactics did not succeed but neither did the effort to quell the independence movement the French won the battle but lost the war. A process that might have proceeded peacefully in a matter of months takes years to happen. The film documents the sad foolishness of solving conflicts with violence the maximum loss and suffering on both sides and the protraction of the inevitable outcome.The insurrection The Battle of Algiers describes was effectively quelled through the leadership of the bold methodical French Colonel Mathieu who as we see succeeds in eliminating the organizational structure of the resistance triangle' by triangle' using torture to ferret out names and locations of the autonomous terrorists''partisans' then killing the head' of the worm' their structure represents so it can't regenerate.' Once this happens after a merciless French campaign following a general strike the sympathizers in the majority Algerian population are totally demoralized but two years later a vigorous national independence movement suddenly' spontaneously' springs forth and not long afterward France has to grant Algerian independence. It's at this point rather than at the moment of Mathieu's momentary triumph that the film ends.Gillo Pontecorvo undertook his masterpiece after prodding from the resistance leader Saadi Yacef but he made a film equally sympathetic toward and critical of both sides. We see as much of the French dissection of the situation and repression of it by the police chief then Colonel Mathieu as we see of the terrorists''partisans' planning and execution of their actions. We see Colonel Mathieu as an appealing macho hero with moments of noble fair play a shadeswearing cigarette puffing veteran who moves around with clarity honesty and panache he himself has a partisan' background. The terrorist''rebel' leaders are serious intensely committed men of various types from the sophisticated intellectual to the young firebrand. There are no heroes' here or alternately if you like they're all heroes.'Mathieu appears before the press beside the captured rebel''terrorist' leader  an unusual move in itself  and expresses his respect for the man's courage and conviction. The rebel' leader in this scene is eloquent in defending terrorist''rebellion' methods such as the use of baskets filled with explosives in public places. Give us your bombs and we'll give you our baskets.' Mathieu for his part effectively explains to the journalists the necessity of torture to short circuit the rebellion''terrorism'. After this explanation the film typically systematic at this point begins showing a series of tortures of Algerians being carried out.The first image we see in the film is the shattered face and body of the small tortured Algerian man who's broken down and revealed where Ali La Pointe' the firebrand the last remaining leader is hiding. Then we see the terrorist''terrorist' leader Ali and his closest supporters trapped like deer in their hideaway their faces soft and beautiful. The splendid black and white photography works like William Klein's Fifties and Sixties images he's one of the key visual commentators of that period stylistically to powerfully capture the edgy soulfulness of the North African people and their gritty Casbah milieu. Much of the film's power comes from the way Pontecorvo was able to work through Saadi Yacef directly in the Casbah among the real people  as Fernando Meirelles worked in the favelas of Brazil recently with local boys to forge the astonishing City of God.The voices which are dubbed as was the fixed Italian filmmaking style work somewhat less effectively because of obvious disconnects between mouth and sound at times but the French is so analytical and the Algerians' Arabic so exoticsounding even to a student of Arabic that they work and the insistent exciting music composed by Pontecorvo himself in collaboration with Ennio Morricone is a powerful element in the film's relentless forward movement.The fast rhythms of the editing are balanced by the stunning authenticity of the hundreds of Algerian extras who swarm across the screen it's in the crowd scenes that The Battle of Algiers really sings. There are many superb sequences of street fighting of people massing at checkpoints of the French victims innocently assembled in public places and like an exhilarating coda there is the scene of joyous victory as Algerians celebrate their independence in the last blurry moments. This is a film again like City of God of almost intoxicating  and nauseating  violence complexity and fervor. Pontecorvo's accomplishment though is the way through showing the leaders analyzing and debating the action he freezes any impulse toward partisanship in its tracks. The evenhandedness of the coverage works a Brechtian Alienation Effect' so you don't get caught up in rooting for one side or the other.The sequence of three pretty Algerian women carrying out an operation is a particularly memorable one  but only one among many. First they take off their burqas and cut their hair and doll themselves up French style and then they get past the checkpoint into the French quarter to leave handbags full of explosives in a bar a dance club and an airport lounge. Again closeups of faces in the bar and the jive dancers with jaunty jabbing elbows in the club show a brilliant use of image and classic editing first the innocent vulnerable faces then the explosions. Here our sympathies for the French victims are fully awakened. Another sequence of Algerians removing bodies from a building has all the power and sadness of Christ's Passion.There's no point where as in a conventional thriller we feel excitement and sympathy for the perpetrator because we see the cruelty of the perpetrator and the humanity of the victim every time. The Battle of Algiers is a final triumphant use of Italian cinematic neorealismo. The killing is observed neutrally but with sadness as part of a stupid game caused by ignorance and played out compulsively when a political settlement would have been infinitely better  a stupid game observed with astonishing zest.Revived thirtyfive years later in a new 35mm. print its grainy beauty pristinely vivid The Battle of Algiers remains a superbly made machine that plays out the addictive game of terrorism' repression torture revolt and fullfledged insurrection as effectively now as when it was first issued. Like any classic it's of its time and of all time. There's a lesson here but it's not for partisans or colonialists it's for all people.".

Even though you are told at the beginning that no documentary footage is used it is at times hard to believe as many of the images you see have a stark and often unsettling reality to them. Considering that this was a co production between Algeria and Italy the film is remarkable in that it does not turn itself a political tirade by taking sides. Instead the camera is a sort of neutral observer allowing us to witness events that spiraled from individual demonstrations to a full scale war of savage intensity. French officers who fought the Nazis a few years before degenerated into the mode of their former enemy while Algerians had no problems exploding bombs that would kill their own people.

When the movie starts we see 4 people hiding from the French Army. Then all of a sudden this amazingly haunting music starts and we're told the story in flashback of how the Algierian people tried to revolt against the French Soldiers.From what I understand the movie uses no documentary footage which is amazing as some of the scenes in the movie must have taken a great deal of effort to produce. There are some pretty amazing crowd scenes and the explosion scenes are just breathtaking.Also I guess some of the actual revolutionaries are in the film as well. They are pretty hard to point out as  all of the acting here is amazing very realistic.So looking for a war movie? Dammit don't go for Private Ryan go to Algiers.".

	schema:reviewBody "Battle of Algiers might well be the best historical film ever. It stands out as a splendid work of art as an extremely accurate depiction of a specific time and place as a political hymn to independence and as a thoughtprovoking philosophical reflection on violence and on the relationship between ends and means.It depicts the crucial years 19561957 in the Algerian war of independence from French colonial rule the leaders of the independentist FLN decide to make Algiers a battlefield through strikes and terrorism in order to shake colonialism and to unite Algerians. The French respond to this urban guerilla with a ruthless control of space separating European and Arab the 'casbah' parts of the city and with a brutal hunt of the FLN leaders through the torture of lesser militants. The French paratroops under gen. Massu col. Bigeard and cdt. Aussaresses blended in the film into a synthetic and fictitious character col. Mathieu eventually 'win' the battle of Algiers but they end up 'losing' Algeria as their repression has only fueled nationalism. The film therefore ends with the vision of Algerian crowds demanding independence 'Istiqll' as they march through the streets of Algiers in 1960.While this is an accurate enough analysis of such a complex war even though interestingly de Gaulle is absent from the film as it intends to show how independence was conquered not handed from above by French authorities it is also a metaphor as the film works on many different levels.It is a masterpiece of editing and cinematography. The combined use of space and music is stunning when the french paratroops take possession of the Casbah literally filling up the frame gaining control of the streets rooftops hallways courtyards their superbly choreographed movements are underlined by a haunting theme by Morricone  director Pontecorvo. In these sequences he rivals not only Rossellini but Eisenstein.It is also strongly influenced by the New Wave in its manner of filming faces of protagonists. Some of the most beautiful moments in the film as the beginning in Ali's hiding hole or the scenes before the explosions in the bars consist of protagonists' faces victims perpetrators bystanders shot in close up in a beautiful black and white without comment or voiceover their common humanity is shown as well as the determination the inner flame of those fighting for independence.I would disagree with other reviewers saying the movie is is unbiased the film was commissioned and encouraged by the newborn Algerian state and Yacef Saadi a leader in the war of independence appears in prominent role. While the violence of both sides is coolly examined the film justifies that of the Algerians if only by showing in a slightly dishonest way that it always responds to the violence of the French. This question of precedence who started to be inhuman? though in the end quite pointless has long poisoned mutual understanding between French and Algerian memories of the war. Another bias explained by the FLN financing and staging is the almost complete absence in the film of the middle ground those neither in the terrorist FLN or in the paratroops desiring to live in peace. They have existed in both sides as the examples of writer Albert Camus and his friend Mouloud Ferraoun show. This is quite understandable as it might not fit in the epic text depicted in realistic manner by Pontecorvo. However in the film the Algerians that are not committed to war are shown to be gangsters and pimps this is a minor flaw of the film and its only touch of propaganda.All that said the film is a stunning visual historical and ethical masterpiece. Sadly and ironically it capture a fiery desire for liberty at the very time 1965 a military coup by Boumediene overthrew Ben Bella in Algeria repressing liberties for the decades to come. Most of all it is one of the most potent depictions of and reflections on violence in the twin and extreme forms of terrorism and torture to be seen on screen.The most powerful image of the film remains the vision of a FLN militant broken by torture and forced to confess the hiding place of his chief. His haunted look exhausted stance empty eyes grotesquely dressed in a paratroops' uniform stand as an indictment of colonialism.".

The French government sends the military forces under the command of the abusive Colonel Mathieu Jean Martin that does not respect the human rights and uses torture to destroy the NLF command.

A couple of months ago I saw Mon Colonel another magnificent movie about this dark period of the mankind history. In both movies we see no difference between the methods used by French in Algerian or the Nazis in World War II or the South American's dictatorships in the 60's 70's and 80's or by the American in Iraq of the Chinese in Tibet. Liberty Fraternity Equality for us but torture and abuse of the human rights for the others should be the correct sentence applicable to most nations. Therefore the writing of Machiavelli in The Prince about the behavior of the princes along history could be updated to the disrespect of human rights by powerful nations against weakest ones in the name of their best interests. This movie is impressive because it seems to be a documentary with grainy cinematography and nonprofessional actors in a perfect contemporary Neorealism. I am not familiar with the work of director Gillo Pontecorvo but I really believe that this movie is his masterpiece. My vote is ten.Title Brazil A Batalha de Argel The Battle of Algiers".

	schema:reviewBody "We all go to the movies because we love to be entertained and it's hard to argue that it's the greatest form of entertainment but when serious viewers talk about film in terms of being important you would have to expect this title to be instantly brought up. This film covers the years from 1954 to 1962 in Algeria when the Arab section of Algiers started an uprising to fight the French and gain their own independence. Ali La Pointe Brahim Haggiag is a petty thief and hustler and when he gets out of jail he teams up with Elhadi Jaffar Saadi Yacef and together they form the Algerian National Liberation Front FLN in which they start terrorist attacks.SPOILER ALERT French authorities bring in Col. Mathieu Jean Martin to head the antiterrorist unit and he uses methods of torture to slowly eliminate the insurrectionists who hide behind walls in apartments in the Casbah. Eventually Col. Mathieu kills Ali and it seems that everything will go back to what they were but two years later the Arabs take to the streets in huge numbers which causes the U.N. to take notice and in 1962 Algeria finally gained it's independence.This was made by Italian filmmaker Gillo Pontecorvo who shot this in the actual locations in Algeria and used mainly nonactors in his cast Martin is the only professional and the story is based on a book by Yacef who not only is a survivor of these true events but is cast in an important role. Pontecorvo has created a film that seems so real that he had to have a disclaimer put into the credits stating that no newsreel or documentary footage was used which is incredible because there are so many scenes in which it appears that real events were caught on film. The script does it's best to show both the positive and the negative of both sides of the French and the FLN but it does seem that Pontecorvo leans towards the side of the Arabs. This all takes place in a time when most American viewers were not aware of what terrorism was about and in 1965 it was probably easy to just point at the French and think they should just get out but now in our day and age audiences are a little more sophisticated to the world and it's politics. There are scenes that take place that we will probably never see done again because of the lack of safety especially the shots of the bombs exploding and the socalled actors scrambling for their lives. Another point in the film shows a French soldier bursting into an apartment to search it and accidentally stepping on a crying baby! There is no doubt that this is one of the most important films ever made not just because of the subject matter but in the skill that Pontecorvo applies to achieve his vision. In 1965 this may not have been perceived as a truly great film but now 40 years later it's looked at as one of the most important films ever made and one that is studied by military personnel and those in the Pentagon.".

And I know what I'm talking about as I was there in Algeria during the 'Dark Decennial' while we were fighting against our own people whom turned terrorists in the name of Islam.So for those who will watch this film please just remember not to judge any of the parties  Algerian or French. It was a war and no war is nice people die and those who survive will suffer. Filmsart are a form of exorcism for that pain we keep silently inside.I like this movie because I saw tears in the beautiful green eyes of my grand mother every time she watched it and it always gave her a good opportunity to cry for my grand father that she lost during the war. I saw my father crying for his father that he never knew and saw him also being closer to his mom because. For me this movie will always be a 'Good movie to watch in Family'".

	schema:reviewBody "The problem with films like The Battle of Algiers is that while they offer a stark portrait of a truelife event they also lack any kind of emotion and so connecting with the film is not easy. The film follows the events of the revolution in Algiers but doesn't give you much of a story as to why it happened and so prior knowledge of the event is required from the viewer. I know practically nothing about Algiers so this wasn't a very good aspect of the movie for me and through it's lack of emotional connection I can't help but think I'd have been better off watching the news or a documentary on the subject. The Battle of Algiers is unpleasant throughout and we watch as coffee shops are blown up and the French Foreign Legion tortures the locals. Like Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer this film begs a question of it's viewer  namely why are you watching this? However while Henry had the whole 'slasher' craze on it's side to help answer the question  the events in this film are far more brutal than those in Henry and are also on a far larger scale. Not to mention far more tragic as they definitely did actually happen. Couple this with it's lack of an emotional side and we have the question indeed why ARE you watching this? It's not entertainment that's for sure.The cinematography is very bleak and offers a stark portrayal of the events that the film is depicting. This is the film's major strong point  it looks very nice. None of the cast stands out individually but the ensemble comes together nicely and the acting is extremely realistic so much so that what is being depicted could easily be documentary footage. The main backbone of the film's substance focuses on the common 'war has no winners' theme that a hundred films have depicted before and after it except even this is brought down by it's emotional void. While films such as Lewis Milestone's All Quiet on the Western Front gave you characters to feel for The Battle of Algiers has none and even though it's message is still felt it's not as potent as it could and by rights should have been. Due to the current state of the world most notably the current mood in the USA The Battle of Algiers can easily be used as a benchmark to draw parallels with nowadays which in a way has given it a new lease of life in today's society. On the whole I respect this movie for it's technical achievement and the fact that it offers an unbiased account of an important event in history. But I don't like it.".

The same strategy was used most effectively by the British in Malaya in the 1950s where it crushed a communist insurrection  though it was painfully ineffective when the Brits used it in Afghanistan 50 years later . We can all remember the hurtful comments about France being shouted from The White House during Dubya's era but didn't stop the irony  if not out and out hypocrisy  of the same politicians watching this film in order to pick up a few tips on counter insurgency warfare in Iraq and Afghanistan Before tonight I saw this almost 20 years ago and have never forgotten it . What I remembered most was the very even handed dealt out to both sides . This doesn't mean it tries either side as light gray  more like very very dark gray which neither side should be proud of . Based on the grim realities of the time . The French are happy to carry out black ops against the rebellion by blowing up innocent Algerian citizens making out houses are used for bomb factories and brutally torturing interned suspects while the Algerian rebels  FLN  blow up innocent civilians at coffee bars and sports stadiums  their victims not being the French military but innocent men woman and children . There are moments that can only be described as surreal irony where for example an Algerian child is stopped from being beaten to death by a French gendarme This is a political film that shows a neutral point of view . In this type of conflict nearly everyone is neutral . Both the French and FLN try and make a headway in to turning the neutral in to being on  Our side . Watching it in 2012 however you must be aware of one thing The FLN are Muslims but they don't want to make a liberated Algeria in to a theocratic Islamic state  they're  Relatively secular  nationalists fighting again French colonialism . They're offering the Algerian people freedom from France not freedom from freedom . There's a subtlety to the ideas being put forward by both sides . The French realise not everyone is a terrorist whilst the FLN realise not everything can be solved by violence  revolutions need the will of the people . I could spend all day discussing the complex views put forward but there's a word limit of 1000 words . Just watch it and understand it There's some obvious flaws to the movie . One is that many of the deaths are a bit too bloodless . Another is that we never see what is happening outside of the Algerian capital though the war in the countryside is referred to . Perhaps the biggest complaint is that two years after the main action the story jumps forward where more violent demonstrations take place without the benefit of historical context but if you understand revolution it's because the occupying power hasn't provided any political gains to the wider Algerian population after temporarily beating the FLN . All insurrections are political in nature and if politicians can't bring a political carrot to the table after beating the insurrection to death with a stick then the violence will continue periodically and ultimately end in defeat . I do hope all politicians in charge of a NATO country realise this".

And yet the movie is not about the fight against terrorism. Or it is but it's also about the fight against foreign invaders and occupiers.The film is noted both for its style as well as its neutrality. A bit more time is spent with the FLN but we also see much of the events from the point of view of Colonel Mathieu Jean Martin the leader of the French forces. And both these sides commit terrible acts of brutality during their fight for Algiers. Bombings mass slaughter torture everything goes.And apparently all this happened in the 50s on Frenchcontrolled soil. Shows how much I know about history. In fact the movie almost forces you to know something about its backgrounds and general situation. Very little is explained and it's more of a newsreel slash documentary style look into the methods used by the two sides. Very little is talked about motivations or politics. Which is both of a strength and a weakness. Those that have studied history in detail andor those that lived during those times are going to find the film poignant and heavy. Those that did not will have an increasingly hard time with it as years pass.Nevertheless despite belonging to the latter camp of viewers I did find the film a good watch. It's perhaps more interesting than truly enjoyable but I would recommend it to anyone interested in history.".

	schema:reviewBody "1st watched 11302007 6 out of 10DirGillo Pontecorvo Fascinating portrayal of Algerian revolution in the late 50's and early 60's from France's occupied policerule. This is one of those movies that takes you places American audiences aren't used to seeing and brings you a perspective that is sometimes hard to swallow. This is a very good recreation of a true story about a country of people who will go to all means to bring about their independence including terrorist bombings on innocent people to get their point across. For us it's initially hard to determine who are the good guys and who are the bad guys because both groups use similar methods to try and control the other group. The movie starts in the middle of the conflictit's really not a typical battle at a point where a member of the rebellion after being tortured gives away the hiding place of the last leaders in the city of Algiers. It then goes backwards to the beginnings of the rebellion and kind of shows how the main core of the group is formed and where they came from. There is an obvious slant toward the Algerian rebels despite some of their not so kosher cleansing process and terrorism tactics but their oppression from the French government is shown as needed to be toppled at any means. The movie then continues up through the initial scene until the eventual independence that occurs but not without many casualties. This realistic documentarylike movie does not back away from actual violence and it's aftereffects but keeps us interested with a linear Americanlike story. There is definitely a little lacking in the portrayal of the characters at the expense of the story but overall it keeps your interest. The movie is definitely not like most battles but instead is a calculated series of incidents done by both sides until someone has to give in. Eventually the French find all the leaders in the rebellion in the city but the rebellion leaks to the countryside where it wins out in 1962. Again the interest of this movie for me was learning a new society it's history and it's ways more so than seeing an actionfilled movie experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "I disagree with the comments here stating that Gillo Pontecorvo's The Battle of Algiers is an evenhanded account of the Algerian uprising in the Fifties. I had always thought perhaps simplemindedly that the movie was clearly on the side of the denizens of the Kasbah. After all the script was inspired by the life and activities of a FLN leader who also literally acts in an important role in the movie. Seeing the movie again  via Criterion's absurdly lavish 3disc ! edition  did nothing to alter my opinion though it DID provoke some new perspective on why the movie may SEEM evenhanded.In two words? Jean Martin. He plays Colonel Mathieu a former Resistance fighter and concentration camp veteran now in the untenable position of winning a battle in a war doomed to failure for the French. Martin happens to be the only professional actor on the premises and this probably explains his dangerous magnetism on screen and his ability to get us to immediately latch onto him for identification. Everybody admires a good soldier and Mathieu is exactly that. Cool worldweary competent tactically brilliant not above admiring his enemies sophisticated. Everybody admires a good actor also and Martin gets all the good lines in The Battle of Algiers which is really unfortunate because we should be admiring the Algerians instead of this professional oppressor. This is the flaw in Pontecorvo's movie that in my opinion prevents it from being a true masterpiece. Col. Mathieu damn near unbalances the whole thing when he irrupts into the movie about a halfhour into it.The problem is that there are no equally compelling Muslim figures in the film to balance off Mathieu. Jaffar played by the abovementioned reallife FLN leader Saadi Yacef is an important character to the plot yet has no interiority. The young man playing the fiery Ali La Pointe LOOKS magnificent but the script doesn't do much for him other than to tell him to look angry. We don't get to know the three women who tart themselves up as French sophisticates in order to sneak past the checkpoints so that they can plant bombs in civilian areas. The teenage boys who shoot the gendarmes to death are just faces in the crowd. Pontecorvo's magisterial NeoRealism manages to be both dry and diabolically partisan after all a nameless mass of people avoids having character flaws and Pontecorvo and Yacef don't want to muddy the waters with unlikeable individuals. But perhaps we don't want that either as the Algerians' cause is eminently just. If you want to be politically correct you may congratulate Pontecorvo for refusing to present the Muslims in a traditionally melodramatic way but this approach fails the test of great drama development of character.Having said all that I also don't want to be misconstrued The Battle of Algiers is a great and important film that is an almost mandatory viewing experience given the shocking and scandalous similarities between what's going on in Arabia right now and the events of the Algerian uprising depicted in this film. It appears that officials at the Pentagon screened this movie for themselves a couple of years ago one hopes that the scenes of torture in The Battle of Algiers didn't give them some kinky ideas for Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay though it's rather hard to imagine what other uses they could get out of the movie besides of course the obvious lesson don't mess with the Muslims. The scenes of torture terrorism and the loud clamoring for freedom will alternately raise blood pressures and stoke outrage regardless of an individual's political bias. The cinematography by Marcello Gatti is a culmination of NeoRealist and cinemaverite techniques and the score by Ennio Morricone is groundbreaking.Make an effort to see The Battle of Algiers it will truly pay off. No film released in the Sixties has more relevance for us today than this one. 7 stars out of 10.".

	onyx:emotionText "I disagree with the comments here stating that Gillo Pontecorvo's The Battle of Algiers is an evenhanded account of the Algerian uprising in the Fifties. I had always thought perhaps simplemindedly that the movie was clearly on the side of the denizens of the Kasbah. After all the script was inspired by the life and activities of a FLN leader who also literally acts in an important role in the movie. Seeing the movie again  via Criterion's absurdly lavish 3disc ! edition  did nothing to alter my opinion though it DID provoke some new perspective on why the movie may SEEM evenhanded.In two words? Jean Martin. He plays Colonel Mathieu a former Resistance fighter and concentration camp veteran now in the untenable position of winning a battle in a war doomed to failure for the French. Martin happens to be the only professional actor on the premises and this probably explains his dangerous magnetism on screen and his ability to get us to immediately latch onto him for identification. Everybody admires a good soldier and Mathieu is exactly that. Cool worldweary competent tactically brilliant not above admiring his enemies sophisticated. Everybody admires a good actor also and Martin gets all the good lines in The Battle of Algiers which is really unfortunate because we should be admiring the Algerians instead of this professional oppressor. This is the flaw in Pontecorvo's movie that in my opinion prevents it from being a true masterpiece. Col.

There were many scenes that were a little hard to watch because of all the people that were killed in the bombings while living their everyday lives. It was interesting to see how many men and women join together to seek revenge against another group. The director cleverly uses imagery to make the viewers see the insight of a terrorist mind. The attacks and battles are insane among one another accusations towards the innocent. It was an interesting film to watch if you enjoy battle and war films. I personally don't do well in sitting still in these type of films but I did understand what the director portrays. I only recommend this film if you enjoy learning about history and wars.".

	schema:reviewBody "When 'La Battaglia di Algeri The Battle of Algiers' premiered in the United States in 1967 it carried a disclaimer assuring the audience that not one foot of actual newsreel footage was used in the compilation of the film. This should give you some idea of the picture's startling documentaryrealism. It's plain that director Gillo Pontecorvo began his career producing documentaries and it is thoroughly exciting to see him exploit his knowledge of the medium to achieve incredible resonance through its brutal and frank depiction of an anticolonial revolution. There are countless moments when you could swear that Pontecorvo made use of historical footage surely such a passionate rally comprising hundreds of people could not be recreated so flawlessly for the screen. The camera sits amid the protesting civilians is jostled by the crowd reacts frantically to the spatter of machine gun fire and trembles with each horrific street bombing. Accompanying these images booms a suspenseful musical score composed by both the director and the great Ennio Morricone.'The Battle of Algiers' recreates the Algerian War of Independence from November 1954 to December 1960 focusing entirely on the capital city of Algiers. Unsatisfied with remaining a colony of France a selection of determined civilians Brahim Hagiag Yacef Saadi  the latter playing a fictional version of himself form the National Liberation Front FLN who sought to reclaim their independence through acts of terrorism and bloody violence. The escalating bloodshed leads to the introduction of French paratroopers led by Colonel Mathieu believed to be a combination of reallife officers Colonel Bigeard and General Massu and played by Jean Martin. In a bid to combat the frequent streetbombs and police officer shootings Mathieu employs any possible means including lynch mobs murder and harrowing methods of torture. The colonel's justification for ordering these acts is chillingly simple should we remain in Algeria? If you answer yes then you must accept all the necessary consequences.Another element for which 'The Battle of Algiers' has been praised is its relative lack of bias. Though the end of the film betrays an unmistakable support for the rebels' cause an unsurprising outcome considering that it was partially funded by the Algerian government it is often difficult to decide for which side you should show sympathy. Perhaps it was just my postSeptember 11Bali bombings mentality coming through but having entered the film without any background knowledge I spent much of it cheering for the charismatic Col. Mathieu and his paratroopers hoping that they'd quickly and efficiently destroy those cowardly cafbombing terrorists. Unlike other seeminglysimilar revolution pictures such as Eisenstein's 'The Battleship Potemkin 1925' 'The Battle of Algiers' doesn't attempt to push any clear agenda every character on each side possesses a staunch inability to accept defeat every character achieves great things and every character commits acts of violence too horrifying to even imagine. There are no clearcut heroes and villains here everybody is a hero and everybody is a villain. This is the way that life is. This is a revolution at its most truthful.".

When the war started french civilians living in Algeria were killed by the Algerians and didn't get any kind of support from the french government. Actually there is been a massive killing of french people and the french army received the order not to move to help them. Algerians people were walking down the streets with the head of french people on spikes. Other were catching french men cutting their sex and sew it in the mouth. Then when finally my family received the order to go back to France they left everything in Algeria memories house clothes money youth and were allowed to travel with a luggage. They arrived in Marseilles people were spitting on them and they had to build their life again. Algeria is the richest and biggest country in Africa but still Algerians keep on immigrating in France because their country is one the poorest in Africa. There are no jobs no money no democracy. French cemetery have been desecrated. Algerians do not take advantages of their resources Gas Agriculture. And every year the French Government gives Algeria huge amounts of money otherwise the situation is Algeria would be way worse. For people who were in Algeria during the war like my grandpa who died couple of years ago they died without having the satisfaction of knowing that somebody cared what happened to them or listened to what they had to say.".
