There is one survivor however  Richard Martin Salerno  a renowned fast gunslinger who attempts to take on the gang singlehandedly. There is previous history between the gunmen and to remove the threat Kane shoots and cripples both of Martin's hands ending his gunslinging days for good.Years pass and Martin is now travelling from town to town hosting a gunslinger show. Fate brings him face to face with escaped convict Ricky Shot Jenkins who he takes under his wing passing on his prowess with a gun with the aim of using the young hotshot to gain his revenge on Kane. As it happens Ricky Shot has his own motive for facing Kane as we find out as the story unfolds.Bandidos is a classic spaghetti western in the revenge sphere. Whilst the cast features none of the usual spaghetti stalwarts that we know and love it is well casted particularly Salerno in the part of Martin. It is also superbly directed by Dallamano a man better known for his thrillers.The film contains some superbly tense gunfights matched with a decent soundtrack. The story is at all times riveting making Bandidos a highly recommended film for all lovers of Italian westerns and maybe a few more besides.".

As it turned out it's a pretty good example of the genre though I wouldn't quite place in the top rank. Star Enrico Maria Salerno brings intelligence to the genre  much like Gian Maria Volonte' did in FACE TO FACE 1967. The credits are quite modest but Egisto Macchi's score is certainly exemplary interesting characterizations too are somewhat nipped in the bud by a mostly unfamiliar cast.Still the complex plot keeps one watching featuring a travelingshow backdrop it's essentially a revenge saga between old pals one trains a young gun to eliminate the other because he can no longer use his smashed hands  but the villain is revealed to be the one man who could clear the mysterious boy of murder! Though the film's tone is generally serious an anarchist streak surfaces during one scene where Salerno's current protg is murdered in cold blood by a cowboy in the audience just for a lark. The climactic shootout is somewhat drawnout but it's capped by a clever bit involving a mirror.I watched this via a slightly trimmed German DVD  where one graphic shot to the neck is missing from the main feature but curiously present in the accompanying theatrical trailer! it also seems to cut off a little too abruptly at the very end.".

This movie is loaded with style and style is the reason why the Italian westerns are so much more fun to watch than the ones made in the U.S.There is a lot of great camera work in this movie. The interesting use of camera angles here gives the film a distinct character in much the same way that the use of closeups marks the Leone westerns.My favorite scenes in the movie are the ones that take place in saloons. There is one especially amusing one in which a man who has just lost a gunfight is sitting at a table drinking and harassing customers and saloon girls while he waits to die from his bullet wound. This old woman tells him to hurry up and die and he decides he wants to shoot one of the saloon girls so that he can take her to hell with him.Bandidos is a mustsee for anyone who likes their westerns Italian style.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rugged famous gunslinger Richard Martin an excellent performance by Enrico Maria Salerno has both of his hands shot in a brutal holdup on a train by ruthless former student Billy Kane a perfectly nasty turn by Venantino Venantini.

	schema:headline " Where Life Is Worth the Price of a Bullet!";
	schema:reviewBody "Seasoned Spaghetti western cinematographer Massimo Dallamano who lensed both Sergio Leone's A Fistful of Dollars and For A Few Dollars More with Clint Eastwood as well as Ricardo Blasco's Gunfight at Red Sands with Richard Harrison settles into the director's chair with this rugged violent Eurowestern about revenge. They Paid with Bullets Chicago 1929 cinematographer Emilio Foriscot's evocative widescreen camera work and The Assassination of Trotsky composer Egisto Macchi who provides a traditional Ennio Morricone style orchestral soundtrack complete with vocals make Bandidos both look and sound good. Scenarists Luis Laso and Juan Cobos have penned a fairly gripping outlaw opus about revenge. A grownup student betrays his older mentor in this bulletblasting Italian western about revenge. The villainous student maims his mentor permanently but the stubborn mentor never relents in his efforts to square accounts with his murderous pupil. Laso and Cobos insert a surprising revelation about an hour into this lively horse opera that gives it a deft twist. Bandidos takes a cynical approach to issues involving life and death typical to most spaghetti westerns. Namely life is as cheap at the bullet it takes to kill you. The only real flaw is that Cobos turns the tentative hero from the first hour into a hopeless victim and a secondary character emerges as the true hero.Bandidos opens with a train conductor shouting We're doing you a favor after he has thrown a man without a ticket off a Southern Pacific Company train. The conductor confiscates the guy's saddle for the company. Scrutinize this scene if you haven't watched Bandidos before because it figures prominently later in the plot. Yes this is an example of an Italian western worth seeing twice! The conductor's triumph is shortlived. A triggerhappy outlaw Kramer Marco Guglielmi of The Battle of El Alamein stabs him to death in the stomach not long afterward. The same gunman shoots both the locomotive engineer and the fireman in cold blood. Kramer halts the train. A lean mean unshaven Billy Kane Venantino Venantini of The Killer Likes Candy and his cronies show up but show no mercy. They rob the passengers and then massacre them all without a qualm. Incidentally the train is another of those Spanish engines modified to resemble an old West relic and the producers forgot to put a tender filled with either wood or coal behind the locomotive to fuel it.One passenger gives them more grief than they had expected. He is a welldressed individual in a white hat Richard Martin a mustached Enrico Maria Salerno of Hercules and the Captive Women that we earlier saw polishing his Smith  Wesson revolver. He steps off the train to face Billy in a showdown. Billy surprises Richard and shoots his holstered sixgun off his hip with surgical skill. This amounts to Billy's calling card. The outlaw leader explains his indiscriminate homicidal urges . . . only beginners leave witnesses. I never do. Ain't wise. I don't like to have my picture up on walls and have people shoot me in the back to get a reward. Clearly the train massacre distinguishes Bandidos from an American western where the villains would have worn bandanas. Bandanas wouldn't have made as commanding a title as Bandidos. Nevertheless despite this selfavowed philosophy Billy lets Martin live. Instead he shoots his mentor in both hands crippling him so that he cannot wield a gun again. The chief problem here is that the hero behaves foolishly when he acquiesces to Billy's demand for a trackside showdown.After an unspecified number of years Richard Martin reappears looking drastically different. An unshaven cigarsmoking entrepreneur he owns an itinerant onewagon Wild West sharpshooting sideshow. Since he cannot fire a sixgun he relies on his fists in close quarters combat with his opponents. Martin has experienced his unfair share of woes. The first time that we see him after the train massacre he is boasting to his crowd about his latest sharpshooting sensation Ricky Shot. An armed spectator casually guns down his sharpshooter without the least provocation. This is another example that sets Bandidos apart from the conventional Hollywood western. Martin attacks the gunman in a saloon brawl with his bare hands and an unidentified hombre pitches in on Martin's side. Later the man Terry Jenkins of Paint Your Wagon signs on as Martin's next sharpshooting attraction Ricky Shot Martin calls each sharpshooter Ricky Shot. Later we learn that the new Ricky is a fugitive on the lam.Anyhow Martin teaches him how to shoot and they split the concession money fiftyfifty as they travel from town to town. Meanwhile Kramer defects from Billy's gang and Billy is hot on his trail. At the same time Martin has tried to get money out of the treacherous Mexican bandit Vigonza Chris Huerta of Ursus Son of Hercules so he can kill Billy for him. Billy shows up in town and wounds Kramer in a saloon shootout. After Billy leaves town Ricky arrives at the saloon where the wounded Kramer flaunts his sixshooter and talks defiantly. Ricky plugs him and then rejoins Martin. On their way to another town Ricky proves that his marksmanship has improved when Martin and he happen upon three Mexicans that have just robbed a stagecoach. Ricky wipes them out with his swift accurate shooting and they rescue Betty Star Maria Martin of Dr. Zhivago and her saloon girls.Director Massimo Dallamano and company have crafted an entertaining oater on a low budget. One famous Hollywood producer has been quoted in a book about The Virginian TV series as saying that a low budget western usually can afford to have only four horses drawing the stagecoach while an expensive western always has a six horse team hauling the stagecoach. Bandidos relies on a four horse team but it doesn't look cheap. Nevertheless this leather slapping saga belongs in the top 50 Italian oaters. Dallamano stages several neat shootouts. Altogether Bandidos qualifies as an aboveaverage Spaghetti western.".

Although Ricky has his own reasons for being interested in Kane's gang.BANDIDOS is a story of revenge and retribution but it isn't as dark as other Spaghetti westerns. It's still quite dark but the story is told in a sensitive and thoughtful manner. The film does have a few moments of quickbut mostly ungraphicbrutality and the opening slaughter of the train passengers and the subsequent aftermath are indeed very chilling. However the film ends on a sad but positive note. The Italians and Spanish could pen a script a hundred times stronger than any American screenwriter in the employ of a top Hollywood studio.Herethe script and plot are the best things about the film it's definitely more story driven than most Spaghetti westerns. The script is one of the most robust in the genre with great dialogue and thanks to concrete built characters the film succeeds . Unlike other Spaghettis where the avenger is just as corrupt and immoral as the villains he hates the avengers in this filmRichard Martin and Ricky Shotare decent and upstanding. Martin is a gentlemanalbeit a lonely onewith chivalrous morals and a genuine respect for others including the law. Even when thirsting for revenge he upholds these characteristics. He becomes an affectionate father figure to Ricky which I found quite heart warming. At one point he even urges Ricky to give up on killing Billy Kane whereupon Ricky suggests to Martin that he come and live with him on his ranch. Ricky is an appealing character one innocent mistake in his past forced him onto the wrong side of the law. It is fate that brings himself and Martin together and this is worked cleverly into the script.He's not a bad man and in the end carries out Martin's will. Enrico Maria Salerno gave a fantastic performance as Martin. Terry Jenkins was solid as Ricky. Jenkins was a British actor and it was nice to see a new face. There is fine chemistry between Salerno and Jenkins which is reflected in the scenes in which Martin is teaching Ricky to shootit is in these scenes that the brilliance of the script shines through. The script has a couple of unexpected twists and surprises which made the film even more engrossing.BANDIDOS benefits from amazing cinematography.The film is stylishly shot with some sequences filmed in first person view.There is a scene in which Billy Kane enters the saloon and I felt as if it was me who was walking in.The camera also pans around in a lot of scenesa technique favoured by cameramen and directors in many Spaghetti westernstherefore the film is not reliant on awkward cuts. Another point of interest is the camera following a bottle of Whisky as it slides down the bar which I thought was rather incredible. The shootouts are also extremely well lensed enabling the viewer to witness the action from a more interesting perspective.Egisto Macci's soundtrack although not one of the best compositions to feature in a Spaghetti western is really atmospheric and evokes the film's tone excellently. After the attack on the train haunting vocals are added to a scene as the camera pans over the lifeless bodies of the victims. These vocals were really effective and made this scene suitably grim. As I've mentioned previously the film is driven more by it's characters and story rather than by action scenes. The action is tightly restrained with short bursts of violence only exploding when truly necessary. The film begins on a thrilling high with outlaws chasing the train accompanied by a shootout. The stuntmen also do their thing awesomely in the final shootout. Although it was rather drawn out the climatic showdown between Ricky and Billy Kane was absolutely gripping with the director squeezing out every last drop of tension.At times the film moves at a slow but satisfying pace. The quality of the DVD print that I watched could have been better but it was alright.The picture was good but the audio could have been revamped to give some scenes more of a staunch oomph.BANDIDOS is not one of my favourite Spaghetti westerns but it's definitely on the best side of westerns as a whole.Overallit is a filling plate of Spaghetti Bolognaise skilfully directed by Massimo Dallamano.810.".

	schema:headline " As mean and nasty as Spaghetti Westerns get!";
	schema:reviewBody "Although very obscure and unsung this is truly one of the best spaghetti westerns I ever saw! Massimo Dallamano's Bandidos has a good and compelling plot albeit working from familiar western themes like blood vengeance and dueling gunmen and most of all it's unrelenting meanspirited vile and extremely violent! First a word of advice that I sadly must mention in too many of my usercomments do not read the plot synopsis that is described here on the website! You are not supposed to know from beforehand who the protagonists of the story are and what connects them! The synopsis bluntly gives away why the three lead characters Richard Martin Billy Kane and Ricky Shot hate each other's guts but only in the final act of the film the pieces of the puzzle fit neatly together. Everything obviously revolves around the extremely bloody train raid at the beginning. This is undoubtedly one of the cruelest massacres in western history! Relentless gangster Billy Kane and his fierce gang rob a driving train steal all the passengers' belongings and then nihilistically execute everyone on board. Well everyone except one the meticulously sharpshooting Richard Martin whom Billy Kane clearly knows from a previous life. Kane shoots holes in both of Martin's hands though so that he can never operate a pistol again. Years later Martin desperately tries to make a living out of training young gunslingers into masterful shootists and perform liveacts at town squares. His pupils keep getting killed by jesters however but then he meets a handsome and mysterious young stranger. Martin's intention is clearly to train his new pupil to be capable of murdering Billy Kane for him but the clever Ricky Shot has his own secretive reasons for wanting to confront Kane. Bandidos certainly hasn't stolen its title! It's full of loathsome egocentric doublecrossing and furious men whose lives aren't worth more than the price of the bullets that kill them. The three relatively unknown lead actors give away terrific performances and Dallamano's direction is downright stupendous. I don't know what it was about this man but practically every genre that he touched turned into gold! His What have you done to Solange? is my alltime favorite giallo and I've seen more than 120 of those and his Colt .38 Special Squad is one of the better Poliziotesschi thrillers out there. With Bandidos he also nailed the Spaghetti Western genre! As I watched the film in its original version my sole complaint is that the characters' names sound ridiculous when pronounced in Italian.".

	onyx:emotionText "Although very obscure and unsung this is truly one of the best spaghetti westerns I ever saw! Massimo Dallamano's Bandidos has a good and compelling plot albeit working from familiar western themes like blood vengeance and dueling gunmen and most of all it's unrelenting meanspirited vile and extremely violent! First a word of advice that I sadly must mention in too many of my usercomments do not read the plot synopsis that is described here on the website! You are not supposed to know from beforehand who the protagonists of the story are and what connects them! The synopsis bluntly gives away why the three lead characters Richard Martin Billy Kane and Ricky Shot hate each other's guts but only in the final act of the film the pieces of the puzzle fit neatly together. Everything obviously revolves around the extremely bloody train raid at the beginning. This is undoubtedly one of the cruelest massacres in western history! Relentless gangster Billy Kane and his fierce gang rob a driving train steal all the passengers' belongings and then nihilistically execute everyone on board. Well everyone except one the meticulously sharpshooting Richard Martin whom Billy Kane clearly knows from a previous life. Kane shoots holes in both of Martin's hands though so that he can never operate a pistol again. Years later Martin desperately tries to make a living out of training young gunslingers into masterful shootists and perform liveacts at town squares. His pupils keep getting killed by jesters however but then he meets a handsome and mysterious young stranger. Martin's intention is clearly to train his new pupil to be capable of murdering Billy Kane for him but the clever Ricky Shot has his own secretive reasons for wanting to confront Kane. Bandidos certainly hasn't stolen its title! It's full of loathsome egocentric doublecrossing and furious men whose lives aren't worth more than the price of the bullets that kill them.

	schema:reviewBody "I no longer follow the Western genre with the huge pleasure I had in my childhood. I prefer Thriller Science Fiction Comedy a good Documentary. Except for Sergio Leone his films I'm reviving cyclically about 10 to 10 years with great great pleasure. Not just for Leone's sake and his unique original stories though sometimes inspired by Japanese like Kurosawa but also for Morricone's music and some actors especially Gian Maria Volont Lee Van Cleef Klaus Kinski Charles Bronson. Clint Eastwood never fascinated me not in Westerns I liked him in The Bridges of Madison County and Escape from Alcatraz. Why am I saying all this here? Because Max Dillman the director of this western is none other than the one who filmed Fistful of Dollars and For a Few Dollars More Mr. Expert Cinematographer Massimo Dallamano dead at the tender age of only 59. He just tried his luck like many others with a not too great story in fact one very predictable to copy the success of Leone's dollars. The Cinematography also very professional as Master Dallamano's is not signed by him as would have been natural but by the Spanish Emilio Foriscot. The distribution is made up of unknown actors which despite the slim scenario they pay off somehow honorably. The music of the film signed by Egisto Macchi is clearly the Morricone clone with guitars and trumpets but not so successful as the original. Surprisingly Venantino Venantini after seeing him in many roles totally opposite to the tough guy is here trying to equate Gian Maria Volont as a villainous gunman. Of course he does not succeed no one can do that but he is not bad. The second reason I wanted to see this movie apart from Massimo Dallamano was the presence of another huge talent another delight of my childhood the Italian actor Enrico Maria Salerno. In spite of Salerno's talent and the only cool idea of the film somehow like a christian symbol in my humble opinion the bullet holes in his character's hands just like Jesus the idea had to be exploited and the script developed exactly there the film is somewhere between average and mediocre. Only for those obsessed by Western.".

The whole film plays out like that.Yep this one starts with a train robbery and a massacre and the only man left alive is or was a sharpshooter named Martin. Shot in both hands but left alive for some unknown reason Martin seeks revenge against those who robbed the train and for other reasons that aren't explained at this point either. What he finds first is a young potential trainee sharpshooter but as this film is full of mysteries he may not be what he seems either.So gorgeously filmed fully of inventive camerawork great actors in front of the screen loads of twists and turns. This one has it all and is one of the better Spaghetti Westerns out there and that's me saying that! I love most of them!. There's plenty of shootouts too and the final duel is very creative only eclipsed for me by a more emotional shootout a wee bit earlier in the film. Enrico Salerno has a certain aura about him in every film I've seen him in  I can't put my finger on it but he's probably the best thing in this.".

The movie tells the story of Kalyani the all suffering selfless sacrificing and strong yet week Indian woman. She must make a choice between two very different men.A female role centric movie Bandini revolves around Kalyani or Bandini meaning imprisoned. How could she commit a crime? We learn the circumstances in flashback. Kalyani falls in love with a freedom fighteranarchist  Bikash Ashok Kumar during the British Raj who latter leaves her in the village promising to come back but never does. The society treats them the best way it could in the situation the family is the butt of mockery. Broken by her father's misery and that of her own Kalyani moves to the city to the singing of the O jaanewale ho sake to laut ke aana. In the city she works as a caretaker of an almost insane woman who is also the wife of Bikash. When Kalyani is told her father came to the city looking for her and died in an accident she decides to poison her lover's wife identifying her as the cause of her miseries. Bimalda captures her emotions with light and darkness falling on her face due to a welder's torch and the thumping of Iron in the background.In the jail Deven Dharmandra the jail doctor falls in love with her. Kalyani is not ready for it and starts to stay away from him. They are always shown with a partition in between after Deven proposes her. Another symbolism used in the movie is the occasional shouting of All is well by the prison guard when nothing in the movie is.The lines Main Bandini Hoon Piya ki Main Sangini Hoon Saajan ki in the end score of the movie tells us that Kalyani is imprisoned by her love. Mere saajan hain us paar is sung by the musician S D Burman himself. The climactic song it beautifully expresses Kalyani's dilemma of having to choose between Bikash  Deven. Though the movie features excellent songs they all depict the situation like nothing else could. This should not be looked upon as the traditional dance and sing Indian style of cinema. Without wanting to add more spoilers in my comments I will give some little details.The character of Kalyani gets lifted from that of a woman who is a prisoner of destiny to one who defines her own freedomNutan is considered the finest actor in Indian Cinema. Nutan is strongly supported by Ashok Kumar whose flawless performance matches Nutan scene for scene and Dharmendra just beginning to make an impact in the film industry. Bimal Roy is another one of the best. He won eight filmfare awards in his career the last one for Bandini and the first one for Do Bigha Zameen which incedently was the first filmfair award. S D Burman is another one of the best. The songs are sung by Mukesh Lata Mangeshkar Asha bhosle Manna Dey and S D Burman again all of them are either the best or one of the best singers. Bandini is brilliantly photographed by Kamal Bose with its rich tonal quality and evocative framing.".

	schema:reviewBody "I finally got the DVD of Bimal Roy's classic masterpiece 'Bandini'. 'Bandini' revolves around Kalyani played beautifully by the one and only Nutan. We see most of the movie through Kalyani's point of view. During a time when women's rights were much more limited compared to today Roy tells us a womanoriented story part of which is set during the British Raj.Kalyani is a strongwilled vivacious educated caring and happygoing young lady who lives with her father and cousin in a small village. She then meets a much older Bikash who's a freedom fighter and is intrigued by his ideals. They gradually fall in love but as fate would have it Bikash has to leave and he promises to return and marry Kalyani. Time rushes through as Kalyani and her father wait to hear from Bikash. Soon Kalyani hears that Bikash has already married and settled down with someone else. Kalyani is devastated but she has to be strong and prevent her father from finding out. The villagers raise questions and harass Kalyani's father. Kalyani not being able to bear her father's humiliation leaves for the city and manages to find a job. Yet she commits the most unexpected deed and ends up in prison.The movie is at it's simplest form of filmmaking. It could have been high on melodrama but hardly anything about it is exaggerated. Even the background sound especially in the scene where we hear the banging iron when Kalyani is about to commit the crime is used very effectively. Songs are beautiful and flow with the narration instead of hindering it.Dharmendra gives a charming performance in a brief role while Ashok Kumar brilliantly plays Bikash but Bandini clearly belongs to Nutan. Her facial expressions especially her eyes reminds us what true acting really is such expressions are hardly seen in movies of today especially in the climax where she has to make a choice her expressions are unforgettable. She portrays her character's inner conflict the guilt and rejection of her second chance in life the belief that she deserves the worst of punishment the temptation she feels to live a life with Deven and complex emotions with near perfection if not perfection and is flawless in terms of acting.Thanks to Bimal Roy for telling us a beautiful story about a strong minded brave young lady in a time when hardly much attention was given to women.".

	schema:reviewBody "Vintage Bollywood films are a new source of wonder for me. With less than ten titles under my belt I still enjoy the bigeyed optimism of a neophyte and being something of a film buff in other genres the critical demands of a cranky old arthouse fop. That being my background I approached Bimal Roy's film Bandini with few expectations and was pleasantly surprised so pleasantly. The intelligentlyhandled scenes by director Bimal Roy took me back to a few of the great American and French directors of the 1930's when realism was eschewed for style and drama was willing to risk sentimentality if it meant giving strength to the ultimate story. The type of filmmaking I'm thinking of was a breeding ground for humanism's values complete with conflict tears and heroic resolution. In Hollywood Frank Borzage would be one example early Capra was another even the uberstylist Von Sternberg. And in France similarities can be identified with the work of betweenthewars Renoir and a slightly later Yves Allegret. But of course what these forerunners to the Bandini movie didn't utilize and which so many Hindi films demand is the placement of musical numbers. The musical numbers in Bandini were excellent not an easy accomplishment given that the dramatic storyline takes place in a woman's prison during the Raj's last dark chapter before Indian independence. Not exactly Ethel Merman territory. The musical compositions and lyrics in Indian movies during 1963 the year of Bandini's release were still in it's golden era and playback singers were being revered as national treasures. Listening to the voices of Asha Bosle and Lata Mangeshkar delivering S.D. Burman compositions is a treat to remember for a long time. And though I only know the lyrics through subtitles their poignancy seemed a very high mark in the marriage of lyric music and story.Which brings me to the real revelation of this film the extraordinary actress Nutan as she developed our lead prisoner's character into the embodiment of a strongwilled yet tender heroine of considerable depth and spirit. She captures the screen like very few actresses I've ever watched as the saying goes the camera loves her. But I'm not here to try more than a thumbnail review of this wonderful film. The production value the acting which also included Ashok Kumar in his sincere portrayal as a multifaceted freedom fighter the exacting and accomplished black and white camera work of Kamal Bose all these found just the right tone to create an unexpected masterwork of romantic drama. Glory to Bollywood. Oh and if you liked this movie I recommend Pyaasa and Kaagaz Ke Phool both by the incomparable Guru Dutt. High art indeed.".

It talks about how she braves all those hard things life puts in front of her. As the second half starts the plot increases in pace and the story reaches crescendo revealing shocking points. The last fifteenminutepart is pure classic which also manages a song.Performance given out by Nutan  Ashok Kumar is exceptional. Supporting cast and the characters involved are truly magnetic.

The very day it comes out on DVD please God I'll be at my local outlet happy to pay full retail. Moon Zero Two has to contain some of the most Faroutman!! Yeahbaby!! ladies fashion and hair sculptures of the late 60s. This point alone demands the film be brought back to life on DVD. The story itself is an adventurous romp it doesn't try to be deep and has been billed by many critics as being the first Space Western. What struck me the first time I saw MZ2 was the fact that all the actors appeared to really enjoy playing in this film. This is just one of many reasons why the film immediately endeared itself to me and continues to do so. As for the special effects?POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD ...Well they're not too bad. There's a scene in a moon canyon where a moon buggy's driving along and it's obvious beyond reason the buggy's a Tonka Toy. But really there's a lot of impressive attention to detail in this modest budget film. Some of the sets are truly fascinating.Overall I'm very surprised that this film has received such low ratings overall. MZ2 is a unique science fiction film which I believe would be included in serious scifi fans DVD collections when it does come out on DVD please God. The story is original how many of todays scifi films can serious claim this?? and  I have to say it again  the ladies fashion and hair sculptures are so good they take on a life and personality of their own.".

Yeah if you can catch it on cable or maybe the SciFi Channel it'd be worth a look. Just to see how events were extrapolated from the reality of 1969. Sadly the politicians killed Apollo just when they were getting good at going to interesting places on the moon i.e. Apollo 17 at TaurusLittrow  incredible scenery. So we never established a moon base like the one in the movie. Sad.It is indeed a Western set on the moon. You'll love the bar scene and all the women. Sorry if that sounds sexist but hey this was the sixties and even 11 year old boys liked girls in miniskirts. So if you ever have a chance to catch it grab a sixpack sit down and enjoy.".

SF fans will enjoy early appearances by James Olson The Andromeda Strain and Catherine Schell Space 1999. Also Hammer alumnae Warren Mitchell as the chief villain Adrienne Corri as a cop loved her boots Bernard Bresslaw as a heavy and of course Michael Ripper scarfing up distilled rocket fuel at the saloon. The special effects are not that bad. Great '60s kitsch and fun if you don't take it seriously Austin Powers fans may dig it.When you see Eddie Murphy's upcoming Pluto Nash you'll be surprised just how many ideas were taken from this film.".

It had a great over the top 1960's pop score. It was one of the first movies I saw that tried to turn space into a western except with women in miniskirts and everything in bright euro 60's colors. Olson plays a down and out astronaut who once was famous for commanding the first mission to mars. He and his Russian partner run a charter space ship business on the moon. Their space ship moon zero two is old and barely up to code. But Olson is an old hand on the moon. He accepts two jobs that turn out to be related. A beautiful woman from Earth wants him to find her brother who is missing from his mining claim. Second a rich bad guy with a plan to crash an asteroid into the moon. This movie more then anything else was fun with a great deal of style.".

There is a conflict in the movie about the tone is it a scifi thriller with action and danger or a tongue in cheek effort with Moonopoly even?  The effects are good in some areas and really poor in others but apart from 2001 you can say that about most sci fi films of that era.  It shares something else with 2001 that other more famous scifi movies don't and that's no sound in a vacuum.  Full credit to the film makers that they paid attention to their science.  In fact the movie script has some basis in real science about conditions on the moon and in space groovy sequence of a spacesuit puncture causing the crushing of a hired goon.  So we have no noise in a vacuum but do they give us just silence? No they fill the soundtrack with what can be only described as the kind of music known as PornoJazz.

	schema:reviewBody "I have nothing bad to say about this movie. Other than the fact it is as of July 2013 an on demand DVD meaning it has NO special features even though the two principals James Olson and Catherine Schell are still alive to provide an interview and commentary track and any number of film historians would take about 50 and a shot of scotch to review it. Set in 2021 the plot concerns Olson's Capt. William H. Kemp an aging astronauthero who runs a space salvage operation on the moon where he scratches out every buck for survival. He gets involved with the stunningly lovely Schell's Clementine Taplin who is trying to find a lost miner brother on the far side of the moon. Throw in a no nonsense do anything for a Lunar Dollar businessman and an asteroid made of sapphire and there is the standard action conflict. This movie has been described as a Space Western and I see the tropes and along with what would be called homage today  six shooter bad guy vs. good guy aging hero and show downs. But the same plot devices are used in Robin Hood Ivanhoe Ben Hur Hornblower etc. and were long before Akira Kurosawa provided a shorthand for lazy film critics. This film is closer to The Treasure of the Sierra Madre than Seven Samurai. And it gets the science and technology of the moon down right and explains it in a way that even Kubrick could have learned from on 2001  make it simple and don't drag it out. The science is pretty bang on. That is the problem with a lot of 60s productions about space they were slightly a notch above the bug eyed monster craze of the 50s in terms of believable science. But audiences were savy by 19691970 having been exposed to coverage of the real NASA lunar program and other space exploration efforts. I would say this movie owes a little to Gerry and Sylvia Anderson's Journey to the Far Side of the Sun and the then in production television show UFO in terms of realism and look. Stylistic look with props that make sense and good looking 60s women in future clothes. It all makes one long for the future we were promised but never realized in the late 60s. Now where is my food in a pill and hover car?".

	schema:headline " Good Genre Blending Kitsch";
	schema:reviewBody "Interesting effort here by the usually predictable Hammer Studios best known for all those low budget Dracula movies with Christopher Lee and Frankenstein movies with Peter Cushing. Hammer actually worked in a number of genres during their heyday with spy films and crime thrillers wartime potboilers pirate escapades. They had already crossed their usual horror motifs with a heavy dose of science fiction with their Quatermass series but for whatever reason Hammer never made a traditional looking western even though some of their principal talent had contributed to a couple. Too bad I am sure they would have had an intriguing go at it.This was their compromise a clearly 2001 inspired concoction mixing some of the more obvious elements of a western  six guns saloons claim jumping gunslingers a fetching damsel in distress a cynical hero  with the then familiar trappings of science fiction space epics. Space suits instead of cowboy attire moon buggies instead of stagecoaches and a lady moon sheriff who packs twin pistols in holsters attached to her thighhigh Go Go boots. Whatever. The idea was viable enough for Peter Hyams to revisit in a more sober manner with 1981's Outland a subtle remake of High Noon set at a mining complex on one of Jupiter's moons.The blend of genres will either go over well or create profound disbelief as is evidenced by the film having been enshrined in Mystery Science Theater 3000's hall of fame of parody screenings with all those annoying smug comments from the dorks in the front row superimposed on the screen. The film is silly enough in itself without their schtick I'm not a big MST3K fan sorry and just as with Elvira just because they choose to send up a given movie that doesn't mean it may not have some redeeming parts.This one does mostly in an endearing willingness to try anything and for Hammer what was actually a pretty significant budget that let them pull off some ingenious little effects sequences. My favorite touch are the little Moon Fargo buggies which sure are radio controlled models in the long shots but by golly they have a sort of charm about them that belies their phoniness. We forgive because in the context of the kind of entertainment we are looking at namely 1960s European made science fiction they work just fine.The story isn't much but then again the whole show is in the production design which as others point out apes Apollo era technologies as much as it does a 2001 inspired antiseptic shiny rubberized look. Some may poke fun at the silly hairstyles and clumsy looking costumes I say they fit in perfectly with the movie's aesthetic.

	onyx:emotionText "Interesting effort here by the usually predictable Hammer Studios best known for all those low budget Dracula movies with Christopher Lee and Frankenstein movies with Peter Cushing. Hammer actually worked in a number of genres during their heyday with spy films and crime thrillers wartime potboilers pirate escapades. They had already crossed their usual horror motifs with a heavy dose of science fiction with their Quatermass series but for whatever reason Hammer never made a traditional looking western even though some of their principal talent had contributed to a couple. Too bad I am sure they would have had an intriguing go at it.This was their compromise a clearly 2001 inspired concoction mixing some of the more obvious elements of a western  six guns saloons claim jumping gunslingers a fetching damsel in distress a cynical hero  with the then familiar trappings of science fiction space epics. Space suits instead of cowboy attire moon buggies instead of stagecoaches and a lady moon sheriff who packs twin pistols in holsters attached to her thighhigh Go Go boots. Whatever. The idea was viable enough for Peter Hyams to revisit in a more sober manner with 1981's Outland a subtle remake of High Noon set at a mining complex on one of Jupiter's moons.The blend of genres will either go over well or create profound disbelief as is evidenced by the film having been enshrined in Mystery Science Theater 3000's hall of fame of parody screenings with all those annoying smug comments from the dorks in the front row superimposed on the screen. The film is silly enough in itself without their schtick I'm not a big MST3K fan sorry and just as with Elvira just because they choose to send up a given movie that doesn't mean it may not have some redeeming parts.This one does mostly in an endearing willingness to try anything and for Hammer what was actually a pretty significant budget that let them pull off some ingenious little effects sequences. My favorite touch are the little Moon Fargo buggies which sure are radio controlled models in the long shots but by golly they have a sort of charm about them that belies their phoniness. We forgive because in the context of the kind of entertainment we are looking at namely 1960s European made science fiction they work just fine.The story isn't much but then again the whole show is in the production design which as others point out apes Apollo era technologies as much as it does a 2001 inspired antiseptic shiny rubberized look. Some may poke fun at the silly hairstyles and clumsy looking costumes I say they fit in perfectly with the movie's aesthetic. There is even a healthy dose of realistic science thrown in alongside such recurring SF themes as artificial gravity miniature space colonies and foxy babes who casually strip down to their space age underwear once the air conditioning gives out.Newly rereleased by Warner's on a double movie DVD along with the equally long overdue When Dinosaurs Ruled The Earth.

It's not meant to be Star Wars and it isn't.  But for its time and we have to kind about such films it's actually technically very accurate no sound in space etc. and if you can ignore the kitsch design and costumes it's actually quite good fun.  I can imagine that the Moon of Moon Zero Two was a realistic and plausible view of human colonies on the Moon as seen from 1969 and why it might be a lot like the wild west.  Every plot element of the film is lifted from cheap westerns but it's a favourite of mine perhaps because I was a child when I first saw it.Just remember it's actually more intelligent than many of the brainless and plotless movies which people seem to accept today without question!".

	schema:reviewBody "I read these other reviews of this film here and see where people who wish to come across as OhSoSavvy and smart condescendingly make fun of the period look the soundtrack and the costumes. 'Oh yes by all means let's show everyone how chic and up to date we are...' I swear I don't know whether to be more disgusted at the shallowness or the stupidity. It truly is a toss up...Anyway that is PRECISELY why I personally read EXTERNAL reviews of films here on IMDb and along those lines I became aware of this very little known film by way of the excellent MORIA movie review site which I consult regularly about any and all Horror and Sci Fi films. I don't always agree with the fellow there and sometimes I quite violently disagree with him such as with 'THE HAUNTING' 1999 and 'THE LOST BOYS' However he has a very nice three star review of this film and I pretty much agree with his assessment. YES of course the film was made in 19 frigg'n 69 for God's sake so give it a break. OF COURSE it's gonna look like the period but I'll tell you that it looks a HELL of a LOT better than any film made around 1978 or so which when I see the 'styles' and look of that period I immediately and simultaneously lose consciousness and take a colossal dump in my pants.Sorry... I got a bit off track there. So as I was saying... As Richard says at MORIA it IS a bloody HAMMER film after all and the script is quite solid really. The story is very engaging and the acting and direction are a LOT better than a number of other horribly goofy films made around that time. With an obviously severely limited budget I think that they did quite well with the look and design of the Lunar buildings machinery and landscape. They did the best they could with the cinematography clearly taking a lot of effort to make the best out of what they had.I really enjoyed the soundtrack another thing that some mindlessly tasteless sshole reviewer snidely and contemptuously said to 'ignore'. GEEZ is it REALLY illegal to kill people like that...? Anyway seriously the soundtrack went everywhere from Psychodelic power pop to sounding like Miles Davis or Herbie Hancock to Jazz Flute you name it. Not bad at all. Even the 'dancing girls' kind of had a seductive charm. What is amazing is that this film was made at that time and with this very low of a budget and yet it always seems to stay just barely this side of CHEEEEEEEZ. You know what it sort of reminded me of especially being a British production is the most excellent and truly hip UFO series which I dearly love. It wasn't THAT sexy but I will tell you that in my lowly and wretched opinion the mood style execution and design were frigg'n LIGHT YEARS  orders of magnitude better than Gerry Anderson's later series SPACE 1999. GEEZ that was a real stink'n turkey in just about every way.No I think what really kept this one entertaining and engaging was that it was seriously and competently done. Roy Ward Baker had just come off directing some excellent HAMMER films like one of my ABSOLUTE all time favourites 'QUATERMASS AND THE PIT' aka '5 MILLION YEARS TO EARTH'. He was a very good director and really knew how to put together very entertaining films that many MANY other directors would have turned into a HUGE CHEEEEEEZ fest.So if you happen to like older Sci Fi films I'm not talking about the REALLY creaky 1950's Sci Fi here but sort of the 1960's stylized hip Sci Fi sort of like the excellent Space Operas that came out of Italy at that time like 'WILD WILD PLANET' for example  although this one isn't nearly as stylish as that one then you should really enjoy this fun little Lunar Science Fiction movie.".

Of course the main star here James Olsen is probably more familiar from his roles in The Andromeda Strain a couple of years later or the Arnie vehicle Commando some time later. Also present is that stalwart of Carry On movies Bernard Bresslaw.Of course this movie has its bad points. The least of which is the music. It's just so 60's its almost criminal. Add to that the PVC clothes which we all will apparently wear in the future along with the garish often lopsided wigs which must have been reused in UFO methinks and you have a film which will always be dated to the time it was made.Other bad points include the acting. I won't go into the many instances but at one point big Bernie Bresslaw who plays a heavy has to look bored and almost asleep during the plot exposition by the bad guy's scientist. He does this so well that you think he really is bored of the film not the scene he's in.The science isn't too bad for a film of this era. No one wandering about on the lunar surface without a helmet for instance or other foolishness.But unfortunately the costumes wigs and music will always make this movie a bit of a chuckle. I suspect this was something of an experiment by Hammer to see if they could break out of the horror genre. I don't know how well it went down at the time but I guess it wasn't that well as I can't recall any other Hammer scifi projects.Anyway a dated piece but worth a look if there's nothing better on or you just want to laugh at 60's fashions.".

	schema:headline " Curious space western which shows flashes of imagination but is infuriatingly infantile most of the time.";
	schema:reviewBody "1969 was a year for classic westerns with such titles as True Grit Butch Cassidy  The Sundance Kid and The Wild Bunch. It was also the year of the first space western. Moon Zero Two is a bizarre offering from Hammer studios who evidently wanted to try out something a little different to their traditional horror fare. The film starts well with a genuinely likable cartoon credits sequence a la Pink Panther but then the real business actually starts and it's a downhill affair from there onwards. Classic western this most definitely ain't! Kemp James Olson and Karminski Ori Levy are a couple of space pilots who eke out an existence by collecting floating space junk and ferrying passengers aboard their battered old space shuttle Moon Zero Two. In between jobs they while away their time at the bar in Moon City it's 2021 you see and the moon has been extensively colonised. A wealthy businessman J.J. Hubbard Warren Mitchell approaches the Moon Zero Two pilots asking them to help him to intercept and divert a geologically valuable asteroid so that it will crash land on the dark side of the moon.

	onyx:emotionText "1969 was a year for classic westerns with such titles as True Grit Butch Cassidy  The Sundance Kid and The Wild Bunch. It was also the year of the first space western. Moon Zero Two is a bizarre offering from Hammer studios who evidently wanted to try out something a little different to their traditional horror fare. The film starts well with a genuinely likable cartoon credits sequence a la Pink Panther but then the real business actually starts and it's a downhill affair from there onwards. Classic western this most definitely ain't! Kemp James Olson and Karminski Ori Levy are a couple of space pilots who eke out an existence by collecting floating space junk and ferrying passengers aboard their battered old space shuttle Moon Zero Two. In between jobs they while away their time at the bar in Moon City it's 2021 you see and the moon has been extensively colonised. A wealthy businessman J.J. Hubbard Warren Mitchell approaches the Moon Zero Two pilots asking them to help him to intercept and divert a geologically valuable asteroid so that it will crash land on the dark side of the moon. But is there more to his request than meets the eye?

For me it didn't work. Apparently Hammer didn't really understand Westerns they were a British film studio after all or hard Science Fiction at least if it didn't have a horror element like X The Unknown and here they tried to combine two genres they didn't do well. The results were disjointed and somewhat cheesy in a way they didn't intend. I give them and the director credit for trying something different from their usual run of horror and drama.Still there are glimmers of a good and interesting movie under the kitsch. It does have a sense of humor and sometimes an actor will deliver a pretty good line that's mildly funny. James Olson apparentlyfresh off Andromeda Strain does as good a job as the screenplay will let him and his performance holds the film together even as it jitters around trying to decide what shtick or tone to adopt next.My biggest problem the soundtrack. I understand that a lot of reviewers liked it and that's fine. I liked about 30 of it.But if this screenplay is trying to be a Sci FiWestern the soundtrack seems to think it is supposed to be swinging James Bond era John Barryonly with the volume and the drama turned up to 11 and the singers having vocal orgasms. Check out the title song as the credits roll an entirely unfunny animated cartoon sequence that seems to have nothing to do with the rest of the movie.It would crank up at the oddest times like when a vehicle was leaving a hanger to go out to the Moon surface. OK I got it we're having an ADVENTURE...but if it's Sci Fi something a little bleaker and more ominous would be better and if it's a Western you'd want twanging guitars and majestic brass and a sense of historic grandeur. But again once in a while things would calm down and we'd get something actually cool and echoey something appropriate to being you know on the surface of THE MOON.One GREAT line delivered by a minor character No one dies slowly on the Moon. The actor pulled it off perfectly. Plus one star just for that.In summary Moon Zero Two doesn't hold up well but there's enough good in it to leave some room for enjoyment.

	schema:reviewBody "If you read the late play by William Shakespeare THE WINTER'S TALE there is a moment when a character has kidnapped a child and dropped it off in the wilderness of the seacoast of Bohemia. That error by itself would be enough to make the scene famous as there is no seacoast of Bohemia. But the scene continues with the kidnapperabandoner being sighted and chased by a bear it is an instruction in the play and later his death due to the bear is reported. What's this got to do with ROGUE SONG or with Laurel  Hardy?Well as most fans of Laurel  Hardy know ROGUE SONG is the only sound feature film of that pair of comedians that no longer exists. The sound track exists totally but not the film. Except for two sequences one fortunately including Laurel  Hardy but also Lawrence Tibbett and his leading lady Catherine Dale Owen the film is gone. UCLA's film archives includes the two surviving sequences on film from the movie. I am glad to announce that YOU TUBE now seems to have the sequence with Stan and Ollie. I watched it today and liked what I saw.Of course one can't judge an entire movie by the one sequence. Tibbett has been giving orders regarding the imprisonment of Owen but a tempest has hit his Cossack camp and the tents have to be tied down. While most of the camp is tying down the tents we see one blow away leaving Stan and Ollie under their covers. Ollie's action at seeing the loss of the tent is to turn over and go back to sleep in that heavy downpour. Soon they spot a cave and run to it. The cave is totally dark and no light appears. They are talking and Ollie asks Stan when and where he got the fur coat. Stan explains he has no fur coat. A moment later a bear's roar is heard and the boys run back out into the soggy night. The bear does not chase them though. As for Tibbett he tenderly puts Owen who has fainted into a tent before the sequence ends.From what I have read THE ROGUE SONG was a work that really fit the 1920s and 1930s not the 2000s. Tibbett is a Cossack chieftain who's life gets twisted with Owen's due to her brother raping his sister and driving the sister to suicide. Tibbett kills Owen's brother. To further complicate matters Owen and her brother were Russian aristocrats. Finally as it was an operetta Tibbett's and Owen's mutual anger at each other's families is curbed by their gradually falling into love.The highpoint of the original film was when Tibbett is captured due to Owen and whipped by the Tsarist authorities. In this scene Tibbett sang while being whipped. It was a hit in 1930 with audiences and was one of the reasons that Lawrence Tibbett got an early nomination for an Oscar for best actor.The operetta was by Franz Lehar whose best operettas are THE MERRY WIDOW THE LAND OF SMILES and THE COUNT OF LUXEMBURG. THE ROGUE SONG ZIGEURNERLIEBE is not one of his best works.I wish more of the Laurel  Hardy scenes were found as the story had an interesting twist towards the end. Hardy always overly impressed by his own importance tells the other Cossacks that Tibbett whom he claims is dead wanted them to elect him the new chief. While the Cossacks are laughing at him for this ridiculous demand Tibbett turns up. It would have been a nice moment to see Hardy's embarrassment or Laurel's reactions.The film was directed by Lionel Barrymore of all people. John McCabe in the biography MR. LAUREL AND MR. HARDY mentioned that Barrymore was usually more at home with serious films rather than operetta. However it is interesting to note that once one of the first family of the American Theater in the early 20th Century was involved with these two leading comics of the 1920s and 1930s in American motion pictures.".

	onyx:emotionText "If you read the late play by William Shakespeare THE WINTER'S TALE there is a moment when a character has kidnapped a child and dropped it off in the wilderness of the seacoast of Bohemia. That error by itself would be enough to make the scene famous as there is no seacoast of Bohemia. But the scene continues with the kidnapperabandoner being sighted and chased by a bear it is an instruction in the play and later his death due to the bear is reported. What's this got to do with ROGUE SONG or with Laurel  Hardy?Well as most fans of Laurel  Hardy know ROGUE SONG is the only sound feature film of that pair of comedians that no longer exists. The sound track exists totally but not the film. Except for two sequences one fortunately including Laurel  Hardy but also Lawrence Tibbett and his leading lady Catherine Dale Owen the film is gone. UCLA's film archives includes the two surviving sequences on film from the movie. I am glad to announce that YOU TUBE now seems to have the sequence with Stan and Ollie. I watched it today and liked what I saw.Of course one can't judge an entire movie by the one sequence. Tibbett has been giving orders regarding the imprisonment of Owen but a tempest has hit his Cossack camp and the tents have to be tied down. While most of the camp is tying down the tents we see one blow away leaving Stan and Ollie under their covers. Ollie's action at seeing the loss of the tent is to turn over and go back to sleep in that heavy downpour. Soon they spot a cave and run to it. The cave is totally dark and no light appears. They are talking and Ollie asks Stan when and where he got the fur coat. Stan explains he has no fur coat. A moment later a bear's roar is heard and the boys run back out into the soggy night. The bear does not chase them though. As for Tibbett he tenderly puts Owen who has fainted into a tent before the sequence ends.From what I have read THE ROGUE SONG was a work that really fit the 1920s and 1930s not the 2000s. Tibbett is a Cossack chieftain who's life gets twisted with Owen's due to her brother raping his sister and driving the sister to suicide. Tibbett kills Owen's brother. To further complicate matters Owen and her brother were Russian aristocrats. Finally as it was an operetta Tibbett's and Owen's mutual anger at each other's families is curbed by their gradually falling into love.The highpoint of the original film was when Tibbett is captured due to Owen and whipped by the Tsarist authorities. In this scene Tibbett sang while being whipped. It was a hit in 1930 with audiences and was one of the reasons that Lawrence Tibbett got an early nomination for an Oscar for best actor.The operetta was by Franz Lehar whose best operettas are THE MERRY WIDOW THE LAND OF SMILES and THE COUNT OF LUXEMBURG. THE ROGUE SONG ZIGEURNERLIEBE is not one of his best works.I wish more of the Laurel  Hardy scenes were found as the story had an interesting twist towards the end.

This is an early musical so you'll need to adjust to the slow pacing awkward transitions clumsy acting and lethargic direction courtesy of Lionel Barrymore more suited to ham acting than directing. And it's an operetta not the most popular or wellloved musical form around nowadays. Nor are the songs first rate.But none of this matters too much because the heart and soul of The Rogue Song is Lawrence Tibbett who joyfully breathes fire into the film. Despite the limitations of early film sound equipment Tibbett's voice remains one of the most powerful to ever boom from the screen. He's in magnificent form and clearly having a ball he loved making the film and showed a personal print to friends for decades. His zest informs his acting tooforget all those stuffy stickuptheass opera stars who infected so many other early musicals this guy is largerthanlife in the best way. Tibbett's shattering baritone throbs with a vitality that rescues the otherwise humdrum score turning The White Dove When I'm Looking at You and the title song from limp operetta fodder into passionate statements of intent.The Rogue Song has a couple of other attractions too. As adapted for the screen the plot has some precode kinkinessthere's murder committed by the good guys a horny countess and a sensational scene of the hero flogged shirtless while singing away like a madman. There's also Laurel and Hardy popping in between major scenes to add brief comic relief.

	schema:headline " The first hour is amiable enough but the story is unengaging and the characters unconvincing";
	schema:reviewBody "Mace Bishop is slumming his way across Texas when he hears that his brother has been caught robbing a bank and is due to be hung along with his whole gang. Posing as a hangman Mace manages to convince the Sheriff of his stolen identity and merrily sets about preparing for the execution. When the day comes Mace goes through the motions until the first chance he gets to slip Dee a gun unseen  allowing them to escape. While all the men ride out of town Mace finishes off the bank that Dee failed on and rides on to meet up with the gang fleeing to Mexico  however even with a hostage the Bishop gang are closely pursued by an angry Sheriff Johnson.From the very start this film marks itself out as a strange mix that relies on its stars more than anything else. The opening scene is edgy but then the credits are laid back with an almost comic theme tune. The first half continues with this tone and is quite relaxed and enjoyable while also being a bit amusing however once the Bishops escape things begin to go downhill but yet there is still over an hour to go. The film forgoes the amiable tone it had in the start and tries to build a story and characters but does neither very well at all. It all drags and is never really convincing with the actual 'chase' sort of petering out in a distracting subplot involving Mexican bandits while the rest of the characters change and act totally unconvincing. It affected my enjoyment of the film  not because it got more serious but because it never got involving. The ending is a massive gunfight that is more silly than exciting and is just a lot of noise to satisfy the audience rather than a good conclusion to the story.The characters are a problem because they seem to have been written to suit the stars rather than being true to the story and situations. The best examples of this are Maria who falls in love too easily Dee who is just Dean Martin and not an end of the road bandit and Mace who is just James Stewart. People on this site have said that this film gave the stars the chance to play bad guys but this is nonsense  the 'bad guys' here are the gang who are set as mangy in order to help us see how likable and honourable the Bishops are. Martin plays to his smile but does nothing else  certainly he is not the tough criminal that the opening scene would have us believe he is. Stewart suits his role but there is nothing to him other than a watered down version of his personae and a bit of relaxed charm this makes for dull viewing though. Welch looks gorgeous and yet she cannot make us believe in her character at all and she is all about being Raquel Welch rather than being a character  heck even an attempted rape seems to have been shot to show off her back and legs. Kennedy just saunters along in a wasted role and the rest of the gang just do the best they can with thin characters.Overall this is a pretty poor film that has an enjoyable little first half but then unsuccessfully opens up into an attempt at a story with characters and such. The story is weak and falls down in the second half partly due to the characters just not convincing at all. The stars try to work with the material but they are only ever partly successful  Stewart being OK Welch forcing the emotion and Martin just smiling and relying on his celebrity status. The first hour is OK but this is one for real fans of the actors but nobody else.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having paid my debt to the library I was once again able to rent DVDs from them and I got right back into the swing of things with this western from 1968. I like westerns as much as the next guy but honestly I checked it out because it was a Raquel Welch film and like most of her oeuvre it's basically harmless but hardly ever aspires to be anything other than mildly satisfying.There's some odd casting in Bandolero Dean Martin !! plays Dee Bishop a ne'er do well and Jimmy Stewart !! plays his brother Mace what is this Star Wars? a slightly more noble ne'er do well. Will Geer  best known as Grandpa on the Waltons  is along for the ride as a cantankerous old outlaw named Pops and George Kennedy rounds out the cast as the simple but goodhearted sheriff with a name far better than the rest of the film July Johnson. Lastly of course we have Welch note how I avoided using the 'rounding out' joke on her? who plays Maria Stoner a Mexican exwhore who has married a rich man and is his trophy wife shades of Anna Nicole Smith. When Dee kills Stoner in the first reel Maria is left all alone and is taken hostage by Dee after his narrow escape from the gallows.The plot is fairly straightforward the sheriff loves the woman who will have nothing to do with him and he tracks her all over God's brown earth i.e. Mexico to get her back. Inexplicably she falls in love with her husband's murderer Raquel falling for Dean Martin? That's like Natalie Portman falling for Patrick Dempsey. Come on as they travel deeper into bandito country. As we get to know the characters we find that pretty much everyone other than Dee and his brother in the outlaw gang is a rotten apple which is such a shock seeing as how they are bank robbers and only Mace really has any couth at all.Martin ostensibly the star is okay here. I never considered him much of an actor but he's serviceable here. Welch is okay mostly she has to look good which isn't hard for her her hair and nails are always impeccable. I liked Will Geer's worldweary sarcasm and venality mostly because it was such a change from Grandpa. And Kennedy tries his best to be a likable simpleton playing everything straight and honest July's a good guy but there's not enough to him to tug much at our sympathies. The big surprise is Stewart who doesn't really seem right for the role of an aging desperado but his insistence on playing it just less than serious is terrific and most of his scenes right up until the end are highly amusing. In fact he and Martin have surprising comedic chemistry and several of their scenes play as asides everyone stopping what they are doing to listen to the two brothers riff. Stewart imbues the film with some muchneeded humor and steals the show at the same time.Bandolero isn't remembered as a classic with good reason but it isn't a bad film. It would be forgettable if not for Stewart but with his comedic licks it rises to be a moderately engaging comedy. There are scores of better westerns and even better Welch films and many better Stewart films but overall for an evening's diversion you could do much much worse.".

They hightail it over the Mexican border with the recently widowed vistoso Mexican Raquel Welch as their hostage while sheriff George Kennedy and his posse follow in hot pursuit. Truth be told Kennedy is more hot for Raquel than the pursuit of justice and who wouldn't be? Racky 28 here and at the peak of her sex goddess phase looks terrific and acts very passably. She makes for a very convincing Mexican although in real life her father was Bolivian and her mother of English descent. Stewart need it even be said? is fine as always and supplies much of the film's humor with his double takes and slowpoke delivery. This is no Anthony Mann Western however and Stewart was ever so much more impressive in oaters such as Winchester '73 1950 and especially The Naked Spur 1953. Dino it should be added is also fine as a decent guy who just can't seem to make good. Bandolero! also features some amusing lesser characters particularly that hangman! and a surprisingly gritty and quite violent conclusion. It's no Peckinpah bloodbath but following what is essentially a fun lighthearted Western it does shake the viewer. Lesson to be learned Don't press your sexual favors on a Mexican woman if she's anywhere near a sixshooter!".

It seems the rest of the gang except for Stewart  Will Geer want a piece of her for themselves so both Martin and Stewart have to keep them in line in order to make sure nothing happens to her.The film is entertaining enough and the ending gun battle with the Mexican bandits in the deserted Mexican town is fairly exciting although the bandits kill Stewart and Martin while sheriff Kennedy is too busy shooting back at the bandits himself.  The tears shed by Welch over her loss look unconvincing and overacted but that's all beside the point I guess.With our two antiheroes dead there's really not much of a happy ending to this one but I'll still give it 5 out of 10 for being rousing and slightly entertaining.".

As stated in a previous comment on this site Mr. Stewart does steal the movie away from everyone. He was a genius. He should be loved for much more than Harvey and It's A Wonderful Life but people just don't seem to grasp his true genius which is such a crime. He is one of the finest actors that has ever lived. A brilliant performer.The two other actors who I feel should be mentioned as providing excellent support are Will Geer and George Kennedy. Both took their threadbare characters and really made something out of them.All the good points go to waste unfortunately in a boring movie with a thoroughly unsatisfying ending. I certainly applaud a nonHollywood ending but this one was screwedup pretty badly thus removing any impact.This film is proof once again that great actors are only able to soar when the words they speak are worth listening to and the director provides the right environment for the listening to take place.A missed opportunity overall but gets a 4 from me primarily for the superior performance of Mr. James Stewart.".

	schema:reviewBody "Despite having Jimmy Stewart and Dean Martin this is a purely average Western that is eminently skipable. While some of the story elements are new and interesting the vast majority of the movie just doesn't provide much that is new or believable. The problems? Well first it is very difficult to believe that Dean Martin and Jimmy Stewart are brothers. It's not just that they look so different but they sound so different as well. Then the whole plot about Stewart trying to get his brother to go straight BUT only after Jimmy broke a whole lotta laws. And finally the romance between Dean Martin and Ms. Welch just seemed stupid. Now I know that she didn't love her husband but she did care about him...and then to fall for the man responsible for his murder just doesn't make sense. The film is just too farfetched and the payoff too small to make this anything other than a time passer.FYIMs. Welch plays a Mexican. Hearing this accent from her was weird though I guess she played the role okay.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bandolero was release on July 1 1968 in United States theaters. Bandolero is a 1968 western directed by Andrew V. McLaglen starring James Stewart Dean Martin Raquel Welch and George Kennedy. Andrew V McLaglen directed the movie.Summary Posing as a hangman Mace Bishop arrives in town with the intention of freeing his brother Dee from the gallows. Dee and his gang have been arrested for a bank robbery in which Maria Stoner's husband was killed. After freeing his brother Mace successfully robs the bank on his own after the gang has fled with the posse in pursuit. Dee has taken Maria as a hostage. The posse led by local sheriff July Johnson and Deputy Roscoe Bookbinder chases the fugitives across the Mexican border into territory policed by Bandoleros whom Maria describes as men out to kill any gringos foreigners that they can find. Maria further warns Dee that the sheriff will follow because they have taken the one thing that July Johnson has always wanted her. Despite initial protestations Maria falls for Dee and finds herself in a quandary. She had never felt anything for the sheriff nor for her husband who had purchased her from her family.Questions Why did the outlaws take Mrs. Stonier? Who was the hangman? Did the Hangman have anything to do with Dee Bishop? Why did the sheriff go after the outlaws? Was it for the robbery? Was it for Mrs. Stonier? What happen when the Bandoleros and the sheriff crossed paths? What happen to Dee? Who shot Mace? Who shot El Jeffe? My Thoughts I really didn't think that Raquel Welch could hold her own in a western picture. However as in the past I was wrong again. Bandolero has a starstudded cast that featured James Stewart Dean Martin Richard Greer and George Kennedy. There was a lot of good action in movie that kept you on the edge of your seat. Raquel Welch was fantastic in this picture. Her ability to speak the Mexican language brought her to the for front of this movie. As also watching Raquel Welch bake in the Mexican sun was worth watching in itself alone. I give this movie 10 weasel stars for Raquel Welch talent and her acting ability".

Stewart and Dean Martin are lessthanconvincing as the brothers but Martin holds his own with Jimmy playing up the sentimentality and romance.

The new Fox DVD is crisp with wellsaturated color and a surprisingly directional matrixed stereo soundtrack livening up immensely Mr. Goldsmith's contribution.".

On his first day he meets Sa5m the 5 is silent finding out about an event called Bandslam a competition for local bands to win a record deal. Charlotte is forming a band and decides to make Will the band manager...On paper Bandslam shouldn't work as well as it does. The story is predictable it's very clichd and in places corny. The plot also has a number of plot holes in it. But despite all this it is very enjoyable and very well done.One of the key reasons for this is the script. Cowritten by the director Todd Graff and Josh A. Gagan the script takes time to flesh out it's main characters although in parts the character Sa5m does feel underwritten but this could be due to scenes being edited out. There are twists to each character which helps explain their actions especially towards the end. Graff as director handles the material well right up to the musical finale.The cast are pretty good too. Vanessa Hudgens is the one getting most attention due to the High School Musical movies does okay as Sa5m an outsider. Aly Michalka as Charlotte is better but as I said I think this is due more to her part being written better. However the real standout performance is from Gaelan Connell as Will. Lisa Kudrow gives good support as his mother and in fact there isn't a bad performance in the movie.The songs themselves aren't that bad if not entirely memorable which in a movie about a music contest is important. At a time when the bigger summer blockbuster movies are sacrificing character for visuals it's good to see a movie that while not setting it's sights very high gives it's movie proper rounded characters. It deserves huge credit for that. In fact the best complement I can give this movie is that it has a John Hughes vibe to it.And that isn't a bad thing at all. Go enjoy.".

	schema:reviewBody "If bad marketing can torpedo a film's chances at the box office then Bandslam is one such unfortunate victim to fall prey to shoddy promotional efforts where its High School Musical kiddylike trailer would have put off the nonDisney fans and unfairly slapped on a juvenile perception on this film that had so much of a mature aspect and indiespirit going for it from its sensitively crafted characters to its eclectic choice of songs that just did wonders.The gist of the film centers on its protagonist Will Burton Gaelan Connell who is the new kid in town moving with his single mom Karen Lisa Kudrow to a new town to try and start things afresh. He broods a lot and narrates his letter of the day to his idol David Bowie. Priding himself as a musical encyclopedia of sorts his human studies classes will see him paired up with goth chick Sa5m the 5 is silent played by HSM alumni and Efronless Vanessa Hudgens and in his afterschool hours his good Samaritan turn and easy going nature sees him making friends with senior year Charlotte Alyson Michalka. Not bad for a new kid actually to have been taken notice of by some of the hottest chicks in school.Then there's Bandslam the competition where Charlotte ropes Will in to be their manager and he has to assemble a rag tag team of musicians and basically be pushed to the forefront of making things happen from recruitment to song selection demo tapes website the whole works. From a nobody before to having his school life all planned out for him this of course leads to plenty of zero to hero moments that you would be familiar with especially if you're a fan of such genre from the Japanese. But director Todd Graff had injected the film with enough maturity to avoid being just another clone and as such made this highly enjoyable from the get go.But the strength of this movie laid in its portrayal of teenage relationships be it parental where one's teenage life starts to fill up leaving out one's parents who feel that you're abandoning them for more happening peers or the platonic which is often the catalyst for jealousy and misunderstandings. Then there's the romantic angle which is typically saccharine sweet if not for well placed humour to break things up a little bit. Being a film primarily about contemporary teenagers who grapple with perennial issues like confidence believing in oneself identity crisis and the sense of belonging this growing up tale also had enough backstory built into it that just led to a richer experience without having the need to show everything explicitly.However the film played down the typical stereotypes that come to plague the teenage movies such as the blonde who has to be Ms Popular  in fact she's Ms Quirky here  or that Goth Chick who has to be Ms Emo. On the contrary it shattered some of the stereotypes through excellent characterization that makes you look beyond their physical make up and come to understand the common concerns that you would have identified with given old blokes like me who are way past the teenage years. The great looking leads well some geeks here are pleasing to the eye at least also helped and what more having real life singers and performers like Michalka Hudgens and the other performing bands helped to lend some authenticity to the film's musical elements too. As the main relativey unknown lead Gaelan Connell held the ground firmly and while his character had the weightofthe worldonhisshoulders look Connell was charismatic and likable to have made you want to root for him and his cause without bringing in any irritation of smugness.If you subscribe to the mantra of no music no life then Bandslam is your film. Being a sucker for zero to hero type stories that I've weaned on from Japan this film had those formulaic elements done right and more with its cast anchoring a solid emotional core and a finale that you'll find hard pressed not to groove to. Forget its marketing people otherwise you'll be unfairly missing out on what I would shortlist for my end of the year top 10 list. Definitely highly recommended and watch out for that surprise at the end which just summed the theme of hope in the film really nicely!".

But director Todd Graff had injected the film with enough maturity to avoid being just another clone and as such made this highly enjoyable from the get go.But the strength of this movie laid in its portrayal of teenage relationships be it parental where one's teenage life starts to fill up leaving out one's parents who feel that you're abandoning them for more happening peers or the platonic which is often the catalyst for jealousy and misunderstandings. Then there's the romantic angle which is typically saccharine sweet if not for well placed humour to break things up a little bit. Being a film primarily about contemporary teenagers who grapple with perennial issues like confidence believing in oneself identity crisis and the sense of belonging this growing up tale also had enough backstory built into it that just led to a richer experience without having the need to show everything explicitly.However the film played down the typical stereotypes that come to plague the teenage movies such as the blonde who has to be Ms Popular  in fact she's Ms Quirky here  or that Goth Chick who has to be Ms Emo. On the contrary it shattered some of the stereotypes through excellent characterization that makes you look beyond their physical make up and come to understand the common concerns that you would have identified with given old blokes like me who are way past the teenage years. The great looking leads well some geeks here are pleasing to the eye at least also helped and what more having real life singers and performers like Michalka Hudgens and the other performing bands helped to lend some authenticity to the film's musical elements too. As the main relativey unknown lead Gaelan Connell held the ground firmly and while his character had the weightofthe worldonhisshoulders look Connell was charismatic and likable to have made you want to root for him and his cause without bringing in any irritation of smugness.If you subscribe to the mantra of no music no life then Bandslam is your film. Being a sucker for zero to hero type stories that I've weaned on from Japan this film had those formulaic elements done right and more with its cast anchoring a solid emotional core and a finale that you'll find hard pressed not to groove to. Forget its marketing people otherwise you'll be unfairly missing out on what I would shortlist for my end of the year top 10 list. Definitely highly recommended and watch out for that surprise at the end which just summed the theme of hope in the film really nicely!";

The dialogs are well written  witty and not contrive. Each characters and their dynamic are well developed and relatable. You laugh you cry but at the end you leave the theater with a smile on your face forgetting that you have just spent almost 2 hrs in a theater. All actors were on point in playing their characters.

	schema:reviewBody "This high school musical movie actually contains one of HSM's stars Vanessa Hudgens plus Lisa Kudrow as the single mother of the protag Will Burton Gaelen Connell who is delighted when his mom finds a way to take them to live in a new place Lodi New Jersey. He was more then ready for a change. In one of the chatty emails to David Bowie that provide the narration he calls his old high school Guantanamo with lunch breaks. What happens at the new school? Will gets lucky. Real lucky. He gets paired off with Vanessa Hudgens in a class and they become a couple. A former Alpha Female called Charlotte junior prom queen head cheerleader played by Alyson Michalka finds out Will has an encyclopedic musical knowledge and recruits him to meld her garage band into one that can beat the high school's reigning Glory Dogs and win the tristate NY NY CN bandslam. One obvious motive is that she wants to beat the Glory Dogs to trounce its lead singer Ben Wheatly Scott Porter because he is her snotty former boyfriend. Aside from Ben a generic model of testosterone overconfidence Graff mostly steers clear of high school stereotypes.This sets up a trajectory for the film that's like an older kids' version of Richard Linklater's 'School of Rock' but Gaelen Connell is no Jack Black and the pathway to the big event isn't as cute  or as climactic. That was one of Black's triumphs but on the other hand Connell himself is way cuter than Jack Black whose closest lookalike is the base guitarist a Flea imitator who calls himself Bug Charlie Saxton. Resembling young Tom Hanks or maybe John Cusack with a weak chin a sweet little smile a mini Afro and a wrinkled brow you can almost believe Connell's Will might actually be in the constant company of the school's hottest chicks. Not quite. He's not as articulate and soulful as Cusack and not as edgey and dark as Christian Slater was in 'Heathers' or 'Pump Up the Volume.' But then Hudgens isn't the shiny prefab girlfriend of Zac Efron this time. Au contraire. She gets to be the dark one. She calls herself Sa5m the 5 is silent wears dark clothes and she reads all the time even when Will's trying to kiss her.When you think of Eighties youth classics like those two Slater was in Bandslam looks generic. We'll just never relive that great Eighties youth movie moment or see the likes of the late great John Hughes again. But when you compare Bandslam to 'High School Musical' you realize this is not the kind of movie that you pan. It deserves encouragement. The screenplay by Graff and Josh A. Cagan is packed with inessential cuteness and never takes its dark moments seriously enough  even though it pushes them too hard. The music Will leads the band into is bland  and loud. There's none of the joy in rock frenzy that Jack Black comically evokes. Maybe Wil's expertise  his celebratory and still pretty touching visit to the ruins of CGMG where punk began  may seem more a reflection of the 50ish director than a teenager. But none of that matters enough to maul this movie unless you're desperate to show how musically hip you are. The cast is just too appealing and the action is just too much fun to write them off.When Will reshapes the band by adding brass and an Asian girl classical keyboardist Lisa Chung and an elphinspouting nerdy girl cellist Elvy Yost and a boy drummer called Basher Ryan Donowho whose majors are machine shop and anger management if feels like he's bringing something to life however silly the music and Jack Black was just a puppet master. It's also good that Kudrow really seems like a single mom trying not to get too much in the way of her son's new life but still protective and sometimes forgetting herself and making him a friend or as he says doing that thing of talking to me like I'm Oprah. Sometimes Todd Graff's perky cuteness seems pretty real. Connell has been compared to a Michael Cera without the sweetness. Thank you Shia LaBeouf and Michael Cera is something Connell has actually said for paving the way for someone like me to be the leading guy in a movie. But Connell is Connell. LaBeouf would be a lead weight here and Cera would swamp the movie with his indie quirkiness. The best thing about Connell is he's not a scene stealer he's a catalyst. He makes this movie built around him an ensemble picture and everybody looks pretty good.".

He also meets Vanessa aka Sa5m the 5 is silent and becomes her partner in the class project.The whole cast are wonderful and they mesh well together. There were a lot of funny scenes that made me almost pee on myself. so be careful when drinking soda And the cast performance were all spot on.The screening that I was in was mostly of people in their late 20s60s. And when we came out of the theater there were definitely a lot of smiles. In fact one of them was even in the bus and couldn't stop gushing about it.I definitely think that Summit should have marketed this to older folks as well because coming out from that theater it was the older audience that enjoyed it the most.

It's about making friends maintaining friendships a single mother worrying about his son growing up and going after the success you want. I liked how all of them were different types of people so to speak. My favorite had to be the chemistry between Gaelan Connell and Vanessa Hudgens. Sa5m was unique and very complex and I thought it was cool how they just worked so well together. It's throughly predictable I won't lie but I sure had a way better time then I did watching overrated Oscar type crap like Up In The Air. Bandslam's main ingredient to success is the strength of its characters by far. They are all likable they all have their little problems but we can identify with them all even Lisa Kudrow as the mother was likable!.Performances.Gaelan Connell is an unknown for me but I really liked what I saw. He made Will into a likable geek and I look forward to seeing more of him. Alyson Michalka is really goodlooking but also a fine young actress. She has her selfish traits but we can see what's behind it. Vanessa Hudgens is gorgeous and I adored her character. I'm not like those annoying teeny Boppers who go crazy over her but she did very well her. Her character was very complex and hard to relate too but somehow she managed to make us care for her. Lisa Kudrow's charisma and trademark Goofyness works well here but I also enjoyed her serious moments with Will.Bottom line. Bandslam is now a favorite of mine and one of the best movies that came out in 2009. It reminds me of why I love movies so much in the 1st place.

	schema:reviewBody "For the first time this year a teen film actually appeals to teens. It's painfully routed in fantasy a trend most adolescent movies tend to follow but with interesting characters and a hip soundtrack the target audience is likely to be thoroughly entertained. Formulaic at times but unpredictable at others Bandslam isn't as unique as it is welltimed. Amidst the really sour teen flicks popping up in theaters this is less immature more comedic and generally more fun.Will Burton Gaelan Connell trudges through high school life in Cincinnati at a school he describes as Guantanamo with a lunch period. It's Novocain for the soul providing him a constant source of boredom and bullying. His mother Karen Lisa Kudrow brings him great news that they're going to move to New Jersey and although he feels that his classmates will provide much of the same old annoyances at least it will be a chance to start fresh as an unknown.At Martin Van Buren High he quickly attaches himself to a quiet dark and mysterious girl named Sa5m Vanessa Hudgens  the 5 is silent. He also discovers that the cafeteria is used for live band performances and to support the local group the Glory Dogs led by Ben Wheatly Scott Porter a singerguitarist who is too cool and too old for school. Glory Dogs enters every year into the Bandslam competition a battleofthebands contest that awards the winner with a 10000 record deal. ExGlory Dogs singer Charlotte Banks Alyson Michalka discovers that Will has an uncommon knowledge of music and uses him to jumpstart another band to compete in Bandslam courageously going headtohead against the school favorite. With his new career as a band manager the confusing advances by Charlotte a boundtobetrouble blonde with her own Wikipedia page who refuses to answer Why questions and his occasionally overbearing mother will young Burton have time for Sa5m the girl he really likes? It seems that teen dramedies always get carried away with pure fantasy most notable when the dorky lead character immediately makes friends with the two hottest girls in school. In similar fashion to School of Rock he also luckily unites several of the most talented musicians in the state to somehow work together and form an amazingly original band in which everyone has mastered improvisation and spontaneity. Anyone who's actually been through high school will probably wonder where exactly miracles like this take place. Fortunately although the reality is slim Bandslam employs enough humor and drama to keep things interesting along with a good twist at the end and naturally catchy music. It's a film that may not boast the most original premise but at least teens won't be disappointed in the entertainment value even if they have to look past the mild PG rating. It's certainly a level more realistic than the High School Musicals.Mike Massie".

Wrong! Well not 100 wrong because there's quite a lot of formula in here but the movie does move off model from time to time as well. There is at least an attempt at rounding out the main characters and some of the more obvious plot developments either don't happen or else don't happen exactly in the way you expected.At the heart of the story is misfit music nut Will Burton trying to fit in a new school his unexpected friendship with hottie senior Charlotte and his growing love for quiet nonconformist Sa5m no it's not a typo. As Will Gaelan Connell does well in a part which might have been written for Michael Cera. Alyson Michalka is an effective Charlotte and while Vanessa Hudgens isn't stretched Sa5m enables her to show off some comedy singing and decent guitar picking.I thoroughly enjoyed the climactic musical number though not much of the rest of the music.And there's a terrific first kiss scene  great fun and summons up very clearly what it's like to be in that first flush of love.I liked this little film a lot.".

Would recommend this to all ages. Some very funny lines with this one sit back and enjoy Will as he leaves one school and begins anew in Lodi NJ. As an outsiderloner he is paired with SAM for a class project. The outcome is both fun to watch and makes you feel good about him and his role in the film. Partly told via Will's emails to his idol David Bowie the film concludes with a Bowie cameo. The film's web site should be looked at only after you see the film as it will give away too much of the story line. The soundtrack is excellent and contains tracks from the various bands performing in the annual Band Slam competition.".

	schema:headline " Surprise of the summer!!!!";
	schema:reviewBody "Look at my surprise as I went to see the awful looking Bandslam for a  sneak peak of the highly anticipated New Moon. And I came out  disappointed at the New Moon angle. Yeah the footage was great but  hardly enough to merit buying a ticket to see it. So I got over my  disappointment I mean what am I gonna do. And crossed my fingers hoping  the 87 percent of positive reviews for this film wouldn't make me  regret my ticket price. The film is written and directed by Todd Graff so i wasn't expecting much because that film got great reviews to. Well I'm the first to admit I'm wrong. And I was wrong. Majorly wrong. Shocked? I am too. Bandslam is  such a genuinely endearing funny clever great teen flick that has  just been so wrongly advertised. The talented Gaelan Connell stars as  Will Burton a young man whom moves from Cincinatti to New Jersey. His  mom gets a new job and he's glad to leave his loner lifestyle behind  because of a shady past and hopefully make a new start. Once there he  meets a shy emotionless girl named Sa5m the five is silent which is  kinda dumb. And Charlotte Banks played by Aly Michalka whose looking  for a band manager. the whole plot line is centered around this  competition Bandslam. Kind of like a battle of the bands where the  winner gets a record contract. This film is so unpredictable and feels  so genuine. It has the feel of a film by the late great John Hughes.  It's a very cool movie about very cool misunderstood kids. Ignore the  Disney casting session the film has depth. The performances aren't all  perfect but they feel real and the great bits outnumber the awkward  ones by far. Connell is so endearing as Will Burton. He's a real dork  at first. And just a movie dork. He's a little odd looking a loner and  not in a cool way and is way bad with being social. But by the end you  will love him and think he's a very cool guy. His love of music alone  is enough to set him apart. the film sports surprising knowledge of the  Velvet Underground the birth of punk at CBGBs The Ramones and even an  cameo by David Bowie himself. Lisa Kudrow is surprisingly great as  Will's mother. She shows a great range of depth emotion and comedic  timing. Hudgens is less successful as Sa5m but has some truly endearing  moments and has great chemistry with Connell and Michalka is even less  successful as Charlotte but when her characters storyline takes a  surprising turn so does her performance. The film is just really great  much along the lines of last years surprise Nick and Norah's infinite  playlist. the film is smart funny and genuine. A new classic for this  generation. Too bad not many will see it just as no one really showed  up for Charlie Bartlett Nick and Nora or the girl next door. The film  is really solid the surprise of the summer you should definitely check  it out.".

You know how teen movies  especially ones involving kids competing against each other in school related events  tend to be highly predictable? Well this movie had real unpredictable moments I mean real ones. Like when Will is upstage and everyone is chanting his name this is not a spoiler don't worry I didn't know what was going to happen until it happened. I know this might sound kind of lame it's only a detail but the fact that they managed to surprise me with it was really something.And the mirror scene. How many people wish they had thought of this for show and tell? And the kissing scene! HAHAHAHAHAHA. With the hat and the hair. God that was funny. I'm still laughing just thinking about it! The only reason I'm giving it a 9 is because one small detail bothered me. How in the world did they come up with the song at the end? It was a little farfetched which kind of clashed with the rest of the movie because the rest made sense if you've seen the movie you'll know what I mean.And I cried! Twice! One time because I was touched and the other time because I was sad...So this is a FAMILY movie that is CLEVER FUNNY SAD TOUCHING. I highly recommend this if you're hanging out with your younger sibling or if you are babysitting a 12 year old not younger than 12 though because they might not get all the jokes... They will LOVE it and so will you!".

All I can say is that if you go in thinking this movie will be completely dreadful you'll be proved wrong. I really enjoyed it. I mean the actors weren't great. There was some good writing in there and they didn't really embrace what they had to work with or showcase it in any way. But they weren't awful. Lisa Kudrow was great though. Really liked her. I was completely satisfied with the ending. This movie showed the Disney stars taking small steps towards growing out of their roots. 910 is my final grade. Go see it.Also Honor Society who plays a song on the soundtrack were at the screening. They also open up for the Jonas Brothers! They went straight to the concert after signing autographs and shaking hands with people. So cool. I also won a DVD for naming their band correctly. Had a fun time.".

Another thing that this movie has is an actual good sense of music not that Corbin blah junk that most of these stupid Disney movies have. This movie has famous Indy rocker songs from the 90's! if that's not different for this type of movie than i do not know what is. Though some of the commercials are very dumb for this movie it does include a Taylor Lautner interview for Twilight 2 New Moon for all you twilight fans out there. Also Alison Michalka who in this movie has made a big comeback did an excellent job playing Charlotte as did Vannessa Anne Hudgens as Sa5m the 5 is silent. Lastly i think that the love of music that the main character has can teach us all something about faith love and band slam.".

I thought this would be a movie on the heels of HSM Camp Rock etc etc GREAT MOVIES that I enjoyed but were made for the whole family and ESPECIALLY for kids but Bandslam is well and truly a Teen movie and which even adults would thoroughly enjoy.Bandslam is the story of Will an unpopular kid who lacks friends and a social life so when his mom breaks to him the news that they are moving to another town he greets it initially with enthusiasm and excitement but it was short lived as he realizes it wouldn't be much different there as he believes his personality and character would always be that of an 'social outcast'. However when he does arrive at his new school an occurrence makes him pose a question to Sa5m the 5 is silentwhich turns out to Will making his first 'friend' and future crushlove interest. He is also eyed by Charlotte a reformed ex cheerleader and junior prom queenwho recognizes Will's extraordinary encyclopedic knowledge of music and recruits him to be her band's manager who also soon becomes Will's best friend. The rest of the story revolves around how Will starts fitting into socially and making friends......thereby making the title 'Bandslam' quite irrelevant. The title indicates it to be a movie about a dance competition like Camp Rock but in reality the 'Bandslam' competition is just a subplot of this movie which actually revolves around the life of Will and him making new friends. This movie actually kind of touched me as it shows how troubled and lonely some kids are however they shouldn't ever lose hope there is always somebody who is going to be your friend you should be able to go and talk to them as communication is always the base of friendship. I absolutely loved the characters Vanessa Hudgens playing Sa5m acted brilliant in the mysterious mystical character her role required but I absolutely loved Aly Michalka's performance as Charlotte does anyone else think she greatly resembles Chelsea Staub?It makes you as a guy want to have a best friend like Charlotte. Overall all the actors played their roles brilliantly and there weren't any real so called 'Bad Boys' it was a movie about friendship and it greatly lived to it.My only disappointment was how it was handled commercially bad marketing ridiculous title although Bandslam is a cool name it was totally inappropriate and it's meaningless tag line.I would recommend everybody to watch Bandslam it's a very enjoyable experience.".

I enjoyed the movie its difficult not to given the smart script great and perfectly appropriate music great performances engaging characters and interesting plot developments. I actually enjoyed it more the second time round than the first. Its main problem is its pacing which is too fast and doesn't allow one to savor each scene and its music. Since the second time around I already knew the plot I felt much more comfortable and was laughing out loud before something happened. While my first viewing had me in a constant state of bewilderment the film is in too much of a hurry.The film also suffers to a degree from Vanessa Hudgens as Sa5m there is just not enough of her! Her romance with Will Burton is undeveloped and it seems they develop into a couple overnight. Not to mention her involvement with the band is never shown even though she ends up being a critical part of it by the end of the film. Also her effect on Wills self confidence is never shown but it obviously exists. Of course the film is already long at 1 hour and 50 minutes but if anything I think it will only make the movie easier to follow and more amenable to our faculty of reason.Overall a good film that suffers from pacing issues and an underwritten character. I want a directors cut!  After seeing it 5 times you can scratch my complaints and upgrade my score to a 9 cause this is the best teen movie I've ever seen. Profound iconic and affecting this is the film that just keeps giving can't wait to see Todd Graff's next movie.".

The film is corny and predictable like few reviewers are saying but the building of the character and the direction and the way the creators decided to go with this actually made it really enjoyable. It's basically about a student in high school that moves to another school just to be a loner all over again until he meets these two girls he ends up getting along with. And there is a few stereotyping in this film from just how the characters look. What got a bit annoying with the protagonist of this is how he falls for both girls but pretends he likes another girl just to end up using her as a back up unless the relationship with the other girl fails. But it sort of helped the film progress and sort of helped it make it into a good ending. Anyways he is really into music and tries to form a band for a competition called bandslam. This is a feel good movie that kids and adults can really enjoy my smile grew wider and wider while watching this.

It is set in the mythical city of Limerick  Montana  a wideopen frontier town where rules by the iron fisted Bullock Guy Madison who submits firmly the citizens and possesses an impressive castle transported  sandstone by stone  from Europe . With an army of bandits  led by the diabolical murderer Kossock Ricardo Garrone  Bullock enforces a reign of terror without equal in history . Then  the Mayor Jos Maria Caffarel announces an offer by publicizing posters along the town captioning  Wanted sheriff  need enterprising champion of peoples rights to rid small mining town of vicious gunman  slow guns need to apply  signed  Mayor . The greatest heroes of the West have attempted to stand up to the Monarch of Limerick but all have failed . There turns up Meriweather P. Newberry Tom Bosley of Happy Days and Charlie's Angels a mildmannered traveling doctor who has never been in a gunfight in his life  he says he can turn into a gunslinger to help clean up the town . In a desperate manner  the people of Limerick rest their hopes on him . Unbeknownst to Kossock and his gang  Newberry has decided to use Limerick to try out his newest invention  a mechanical gunslinger  the Bang bang Kid  robot CAX107. Also joining the resistance fighters are the Mayor's daughters  the lovely Gwenda Sandra Milo  and the beautiful Betsy Dianyk Zurawoska two women who will stop at nothing to avenge the injustice of Bullock's reign .This amusing  engaging movie is crammed of fistfights  punches  kicks  moving stuntwork  colorful outdoors and lots of humor . Bang Bang Kid is just a mildly amusing action comedy Western  about on the level of a lesser BambinoBud Spencer  TritinityTerence Hill movie .

With an army of bandits  led by the diabolical murderer Kossock Ricardo Garrone  Bullock enforces a reign of terror without equal in history . Then  the Mayor Jos Maria Caffarel announces an offer by publicizing posters along the town captioning  Wanted sheriff  need enterprising champion of peoples rights to rid small mining town of vicious gunman  slow guns need to apply  signed  Mayor . The greatest heroes of the West have attempted to stand up to the Monarch of Limerick but all have failed . There turns up Meriweather P. Newberry Tom Bosley of Happy Days and Charlie's Angels a mildmannered traveling doctor who has never been in a gunfight in his life  he says he can turn into a gunslinger to help clean up the town . In a desperate manner  the people of Limerick rest their hopes on him . Unbeknownst to Kossock and his gang  Newberry has decided to use Limerick to try out his newest invention  a mechanical gunslinger  the Bang bang Kid  robot CAX107. Also joining the resistance fighters are the Mayor's daughters  the lovely Gwenda Sandra Milo  and the beautiful Betsy Dianyk Zurawoska two women who will stop at nothing to avenge the injustice of Bullock's reign .This amusing  engaging movie is crammed of fistfights  punches  kicks  moving stuntwork  colorful outdoors and lots of humor . Bang Bang Kid is just a mildly amusing action comedy Western  about on the level of a lesser BambinoBud Spencer  TritinityTerence Hill movie . This is a nice and funny juvenile story for kiddies with some touches of humor in charge of the mechanical artifact .

In BBB both of them are able to show their true potential.  Unfortunately it came a bit too late for Diether Krebs  he passed away shortly after the movie was released.I have one minor criticism though  Alexandra Neldel.

The characters of course unforgettable the pornowichser Ich bin der Geilste. enough enough alles auf Horst!!! Anyway i'm a bit sorry for all the people that are not from Germany or that do not speak German because i think they don't get all the jokes. i guess it's the same problem when nonAmericans see Good morning Vietnam or Fargo and the translation can't save the jokes which relate to speech or regional specifity. If you watch it and i strongly recommend it! watch it German with subtitles to get the intonation etc. like allmost good German movies like Die Musterknaben Lammbock Absolute Giganten... this one works because it doesn't purely try to imitate American cinema but uses specific German setting and authentic dialogue.check out the hidden quote just before Till Schweiger gets knocked down. someone offscreen sreems  Ey Chegebabbas ? mach ma locker! hahahahah.

	schema:reviewBody "Bang Boom Bang  Ein todsicheres Ding is a German film from over 15 years ago that runs for 110 minutes and was written and directed by Peter Thorwarth. He was still pretty young at this point and considered one of Germany's rising stars in terms of filmmaking. However he has not really delivered great work since then and I actually have to say I am not too impressed by his early efforts either. And this includes this one. Maybe you wonder what klamauk means the word I used in the title to describe this movie. If you do not speak German you probably have never heard of it. It basically stands for something that is loud and annoying while offering nothing of value. And this fits the film pretty nicely.Most of this is due to the script but it also needs to be said that the cast here is very limited in terms of range. All the people here who have several minutes screen time are actors that have a career because of their charisma and recognition value but none of these are particularly talented besides that. Korittke is probably still better than most of the others even if I have to say I am positively surprised by Martin Semmelrogge who was hardly recognizable in here and played a clearly different character than he usually does. Thorwarth himself also appears as an actor but is as forgettable as Richter Neldel Knfken and Kahrmann. Til Schweiger has a very small part too. And this is the last work of Diether Krebs a very talented German actor. Sucks to see him go out on a low note like this movie.So my overall verdict for this film is obviously negative. It has a couple okay moments but in the end it simply does not deliver in terms of drama or comedy despite trying really hard on several occasions. People who see this and not much else probably have not the highest opinion of German cinema as this film is far more popular than it deserves to be. The awards recognition is undeserved and the rating here on IMDb is far too high. I give a thumbs down and do not recommend watching it.".

This guarantees an entertaining plot that keeps you watching and doesn't let boredom stand a chance. More so the actors seem to feel their characters and bring life into the dull stereotypes they are to play.I wouldn't say that this is a superb movie it is still largely based on prejudices and doesn't carry any message. But it is brave enough to not just follow a classic film scheme and take even the a bit ridiculous characters serious.All in all I really enjoyed the film. It is surely one of the better German movies of that time.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've been wanting to see BANG RAJAN for a good three years  and in this age of dvds and internets it's not often I have to wait that long to see something but life seemed unwilling to give this film a readily available release with English subtitles. Finally though after sitting on the title for 2 years and almost missing out on firsttomarket to Oliver Stone in the US HKL spinoff Premier Asia got round to releasing it  in a 2disc special edition with numerous interviews for extras no less.BANG RAJAN was a landmark for the Thai film industry a blockbuster hit that helped to create the recent surge in film production and production values. It tells the true story of a village called Bang Rajan whose people stood their ground and managed to fight off the northern flank of an invading army from Burma in 1765. Without their bravery Thailand might just be a province of Burma right now. Bang Rajan wasn't exactly a small village as it turns out but they were far from a trained army and were still vastly outnumbered by the invaders. How they managed to hold them off for so long is still a bit of a mystery.As far as I'm aware there had never been a film made on as large a scale as this in Thailand before  though Tan Mui would have been well into preproduction on Suriyothai when BR was made. Director Tanit Jitnukul seems to be specialising in historical epics a bit and has made several more since  including the very enjoyable KHUNSUK which reunites many of the cast members from BANG RAJAN but weaves a more personal story into the tapestry of the wars and times. BANG RAJAN wants to tell the story of the village rather than any single individual  though about half a dozen characters are picked out to receive the main focus of the story or to represent the village as a whole I guess. The director's storytelling skills aren't quite up to the task of weaving together these threads into a coherent picture but you do get to care somewhat for the characters eventually. The main aim of the film is to show the heroism and predicament of a whole village of ordinary people thrust into extraordinary circumstances forced to fight to protect their families and their country. In most war films the fighters are soldiers and their battles are pretty much divorced from their everyday lives photos of girlfriends back home etc aside the villagers of BANG RAJAN are caught up in a war that they just happen to be stood in the way of.What makes BANG RAJAN into a war film though are the battle scenes  of which there are many of a surprising scale and brutality. There's a lot of serious injury and the sound of flesh being sliced pierced or lopped off is sometimes relentless. The level and realism of the gore in the film is very high  possibly even higher than Korea's MUSA almost as if the opening scene of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN had been filmed with machetes axes hammers spears and arrows. And still with guns and cannons too for that matter. The Premier Asia set includes a very nice interview with the producer of the film where he explains that he knows they can't achieve the degree of perfection in battle scenes that Hollywood films can because of their higher budget but he hopes that the film does at least stand up to international scrutiny in terms of realism. Apart from a few dodgy CGI explosions I'd say it certainly does.I wish that BANG RAJAN had got a wide release right after it was made as it would probably have been pretty successful. 5 years later it's thunder has been somewhat stolen by other films like MUSA SURIYOTHAI HERO WARRIORS OF HEAVEN  EARTH and THE LAST SAMURAI. Compared to these BR must be judged inferior well except for Suriyothai which was more expensive looking but a less captivating film. The storytelling isn't too tight and most of the acting is unimpressive. It is filmmaking on a grand scale though with impressively high production values for its budget far lower than any of the other films mentioned and a visceral impact that still stands up. Compared to MUSA it might look a little amateurish but you have to remember there was no MUSA to compare it to when it came out. I don't suppose BANG RAJAN had much if any influence on those other historical epics that have followed it since it was probably not seen far outside Thailand but at least its impact on the Thai film industry must be taken as a credit.Viewed in 2005 it's unlikely to be a lifechanging film for anyone but it's still definitely worth a watch  and I hope that it will sell well enough for Premier Asia to take a few more risks on releasing lesserknown films that don't already have good subtitled releases elsewhere.".

The comparison with braveheart is easlily made since this movie has one of the last massarmies scenes that is not computer enhanced like 10 soldiers digitally multiplied by 1000Which is a very impressive sceneThere are a few flaws. I thought the fight scenes a filmed a bit messy. It does creatw a feeling of the chaos that is melee but unfortunately if one can't tell one villager from another the all look alike which makes the action scene little difficult to followcompare Black Hawk Down where all were mostly caucasian and had short trimmed hair underneath the identical helmet all wore in combination with the same desertpaterned uniforms. Concerning the main characters this problem is solved by giving one a babyface another a mowhawk hairsyle and britishlike moustache and another a beard etc. The more you watch the the less this problem becomes The other flaw are the special effects these are really bad. BUT I must say that didn't annoy me.The story is easy to follow even the flashbacks are easily spotted. The acting is good for me I watched bodylanguage facial expressions and intonation of voice what else can you do when you don't understand the language The actionscenes are very impreessive especially those with lots and lots of people fighting. The music is great as well maybe no John Williams but more than adequate enough to accompany any feeling a scene should return whether it's a gentle look between 2lovers or an all out end battleGreat movie I'm still impressed!".

	schema:headline " An engrossing Eastern war epic";
	schema:reviewBody "Thailand is fast making a name for itself in the International film market thanks to the success of a certain Mr Jaa in a film called Ong Bak. If you are reading this review I have no doubt in my mind whatsoever that you will know exactly what I'm on about and will be nodding your head in agreement smiling to yourself as you recall the headsplintering chaos that that martial arts thrill ride provided us with but despite all it's successes Ong Bak really was quite a low budget feature and it's limitations were plain to see. Bang Rajan however is an entirely different kettle of fish. It is not another martial arts movie but a war film set in the 18th century and having been made several years previously was Thailand's first major attempt to secure its reputation as a moviemaking rival to the likes of Hollywood and Hong Kong. And unlike the Tony Jaa star vehicle it has the budget behind it to stand toetotoe with any of its rivals.Set just before the fall of Thailand's old capital city Ayuttaya to the invading Burmese army the film tells the story of the people of Bang Rajan a large village that despite insurmountable odds stood up to the approaching horde. With legions of soldiers marching on their doors the untrained poorly equipped and vastly outnumbered villagers still managed to give the Burmese a brutal lesson in Thai hospitality and their story has become a popular example of patriotism in their home country so needless to say the transition to screen makes for a riproaring war film. To this end director Tanit Jitnukul resists the urge to focus on solitary figures and instead concentrates on a small number of characters from various backgrounds to represent the Bang Rajan community. There's Taen the elderly leader who is injured early on in the running time but still manages to be a significant player in the proceedings Chan the jungle warrior who succeeds Taen and becomes the figurehead of their resistance Inn a younger warrior who fights to defend his newly pregnant wife TaengOnn the village drunk whose slovenliness masks the highlyskilled axe man lurking within him and numerous other characters who all get plenty of scope illustrating that it is not just the warriors who are effected by battle but the wives priests elderly and children as well. This is one of the film's strongest points and allows it to illustrate a whole patchwork of emotions and situations affected by the chaos. And it is difficult to pick a highlight because no actor ever really outshines any of the rest you come to care about all of them and when the deaths inevitably occur some are very sad to behold.But of course emotional depth is one thing but what everybody really comes to Bang Rajan for is fighting and boy does it deliver. The opening ruck sets the tone instantly as the two opposing armies clash in the middle of a muddy field that soon becomes a mass of flailing limbs and blooddrenched bodies that is all watched by a steadicam that rolls and pivots with the warriors as muddy water splashes the lens. It may be a lesson in camerawork lifted straight from Saving Private Ryan but nonetheless it is highly effective in taking you right into the heart of the maelstrom. Later skirmishes in the jungle lose none of the brutality as axes and swords are used in evermore inventive ways to destroy human bodies and the whole thing climaxes in glorious fashion in the jaw dropping final battle. The last Burmese assault flings itself upon the walls of Bang Rajan cannon fire erupting all around blowing apart people and buildings as the people we've known for the last two hours contort and die in a hideous barrage of limbchopping insanity.As far as action goes then Bang Rajan is definitely an impressive romp and as an Eastern alternative to the bloated overstylised likes of Alexander or Troy it is the far superior choice. Provided you are confident in your sexuality enough to put up with the sight of around two hundred halfnaked men getting covered in mud and sweat for two hours you'll find a goodold fashioned war story with a great big ruck at the end.".

If you are reading this review I have no doubt in my mind whatsoever that you will know exactly what I'm on about and will be nodding your head in agreement smiling to yourself as you recall the headsplintering chaos that that martial arts thrill ride provided us with but despite all it's successes Ong Bak really was quite a low budget feature and it's limitations were plain to see. Bang Rajan however is an entirely different kettle of fish. It is not another martial arts movie but a war film set in the 18th century and having been made several years previously was Thailand's first major attempt to secure its reputation as a moviemaking rival to the likes of Hollywood and Hong Kong. And unlike the Tony Jaa star vehicle it has the budget behind it to stand toetotoe with any of its rivals.Set just before the fall of Thailand's old capital city Ayuttaya to the invading Burmese army the film tells the story of the people of Bang Rajan a large village that despite insurmountable odds stood up to the approaching horde. With legions of soldiers marching on their doors the untrained poorly equipped and vastly outnumbered villagers still managed to give the Burmese a brutal lesson in Thai hospitality and their story has become a popular example of patriotism in their home country so needless to say the transition to screen makes for a riproaring war film. To this end director Tanit Jitnukul resists the urge to focus on solitary figures and instead concentrates on a small number of characters from various backgrounds to represent the Bang Rajan community. There's Taen the elderly leader who is injured early on in the running time but still manages to be a significant player in the proceedings Chan the jungle warrior who succeeds Taen and becomes the figurehead of their resistance Inn a younger warrior who fights to defend his newly pregnant wife TaengOnn the village drunk whose slovenliness masks the highlyskilled axe man lurking within him and numerous other characters who all get plenty of scope illustrating that it is not just the warriors who are effected by battle but the wives priests elderly and children as well. This is one of the film's strongest points and allows it to illustrate a whole patchwork of emotions and situations affected by the chaos. And it is difficult to pick a highlight because no actor ever really outshines any of the rest you come to care about all of them and when the deaths inevitably occur some are very sad to behold.But of course emotional depth is one thing but what everybody really comes to Bang Rajan for is fighting and boy does it deliver. The opening ruck sets the tone instantly as the two opposing armies clash in the middle of a muddy field that soon becomes a mass of flailing limbs and blooddrenched bodies that is all watched by a steadicam that rolls and pivots with the warriors as muddy water splashes the lens. It may be a lesson in camerawork lifted straight from Saving Private Ryan but nonetheless it is highly effective in taking you right into the heart of the maelstrom. Later skirmishes in the jungle lose none of the brutality as axes and swords are used in evermore inventive ways to destroy human bodies and the whole thing climaxes in glorious fashion in the jaw dropping final battle. The last Burmese assault flings itself upon the walls of Bang Rajan cannon fire erupting all around blowing apart people and buildings as the people we've known for the last two hours contort and die in a hideous barrage of limbchopping insanity.As far as action goes then Bang Rajan is definitely an impressive romp and as an Eastern alternative to the bloated overstylised likes of Alexander or Troy it is the far superior choice. Provided you are confident in your sexuality enough to put up with the sight of around two hundred halfnaked men getting covered in mud and sweat for two hours you'll find a goodold fashioned war story with a great big ruck at the end.";

	schema:reviewBody "I have to say I enjoyed the film even though I am one of those 'Evil Burmese' . I am a big fan of Asian cinema being originally from the region. I am happy for the Thais for their world class cinematography and western style action films. Bang Rajan is truly a good action film. One which gets you in the spirit of their struggle and determination to fight off invading foes. However it is a dramatised one sided modern day 'propaganda' film. Comparisons to Brave Heart I understand. Like Brave Heart this would have inflamed past bitterness towards the neighbouring country men and women. May have even resulted in some public disturbance and crime. Film makers should be more responsible in what they make as films do influence the way people think. I have seen this with many historical genres in films such as 'American Indian Wars'  'The Vietnam War' 'WWI and WWII' etc. Where film makers start off with seeing the other side as the complete epitome of savagery and evil but later films view them as humans as well. I hope that some Scots and Thais rise up from their past bitterness and see that the people who oppressed them are humans too and things have moved on since those medieval times.The action here is relentless and bloodthirsty. It does not glorify war. You will see war as it is. Crime against humanity with civilian loss and suffering and not the televised clean stikes against enemy targets like some computer game that you see today .The characterisation is however lacking. If the director had spent a little more time for the audience to get to know the main characters better the overall impact of their courage and sacrifice would have been greater. Where Brave Heart is a drama set in the background of the Scottish struggle against the English Occupiers Bang Rajan is a merely an action film about Thai villagers bravely defending their homeland and died free against a much larger superior Burmese invading force. Ordinary Thai citizens stood their ground while the proper Thai armies ran away without even protecting their own Capitol Ciy. Ony if they had such courage as these ordinary folks. A little reminiscent of the Alamo or The Seven Samurais as someone said but not as well polished.".

We have a hero with a big moustache. A drunk with a beard. A guy who is younger than everybody else. And thats about it. The rest of the men look like each other with the same haircuts and facial hair. And the names being so different from western names makes it harder to follow. Luckily it doesn't really matter who of the men did what. This is a film to watch for its fighting scenes.If you liked the fighting in Braveheart you just have to see this.

That's impressive alone seeing as the budget is about a thousand times lower than the Mel Gibson epic but when you consider that the bloody battle sequences are just as good as in that and the likes of THE LAST SAMURAI you'll realise that BANG RAJAN is a very good film indeed. The movie tells a SEVEN SAMURAIstyle tale about villagers holding out against an army and that cues two hours of bloody mayhem heartfelt speeches strong character building and tons of suspense. The budget is low and the camerawork sometimes choppy but that's where the negatives end in all other respects this is an epic movie with a high entertainment value.I always feel that 'true story' movies  like this one  have an extra 'oomph' to their fictional counterparts and knowing this really happened makes BANG RAJAN a really interesting film to watch. Some Western viewers have found problems with the villagers themselves seeing as they all have the same haircuts are all mostly naked and all look pretty much the same. That's not too much trouble though as the main characters are easily distinguishable from the drunken axewielding guy who reminded me of Ajax from TROY to the moustachioed hero and the younger family man and his pregnant wife. Acting from the unknown cast is surprisingly strong and combined with a workable script you end up with characters you really care for  and shed a tear or two about  in the battle sequences.The latter are varied and exciting and easily the best parts of the movie. This film is chockfull of action and it never lets up delivering more and more bloodshed until the exciting climatic showdown. Thai filmmakers don't skimp on the gore either so there are tons of bloody arrow hits decapitations flying limbs and people being blown to smithereens sure they're all shown very quickly almost glimpses but somehow that makes the battles seem more realistic and more hardhitting. Sometimes the film transcends predictability and becomes inspired like the bit where the heroes ride massively horned buffalos into battle or when the villagers decide to make their own cannons from scrap metal. Other images like the husband and wife on the battlefield or the warriors emerging from the river really stick in the mind for days to come. All in all this is a highly rewatchable war film that offers pretty much everything for fans of the genre even the cheapo special effects like the digital explosions are good enough to convince.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let's start with the positive aspects of this film  Firstly the baseline is rather unique and very strong. A village is opposing an invading army. Where profesionnal soldiers run ordinary villagers are determined to make a stand to the last man if need be.Secondly the potential of the characters is very strong. Instead of trained soldiers we see ordinary people and their family. Instead of one hero there are several protagonists.Thirdly the final act is simply grand. The fact that heroes appear mortal ads to the realism and the emotional impact of the film.Finally the film has some very good ideas and strong images like the guard ignoring command and leaving his post the burning of the dead or the explosion of a self forged canon.Continuing with the downsides however  The viewer doesn't get a clear view of the map of the village and its defences. It is also unclear how the birmese army command is composed and what their soldiers geographical position is in respect to the village. This makes the attack on the village difficult to follow.The characters of the main villagers should have been more developed. It would have been very interesting to see them in their everyday life before the war.The actors are all rather plain without great facial expression or gestures. Their foreign names are hard to remember and all but the protagonists look the same. The English dubbing obviously also spoils part of the emotional impact.At first the fighting scenes are rather clinic. People are hacking away at each other but there is hardly any close up or blood and guts flying around. Mostly in the final act we see actual butchering and gore.The storyline is meandering and sometimes chaotic. Direction is not very tight and straight forward.In conclusion the film certainly has a lot of merits. However a western remake in a medieval setting with a straighter storyline more development of character and a better geographical picture would take this story to the absolute triumph it deserves.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are some films that are bad infamous bad and Barb Wire is one of those I have heard about. Some bad films are trashy but can be a bit fun like Showgirls and some can just be wrong like Striptease. Barb Wire is a film I guess in some way I'm kind of undecided on it has the making for just a bad movie with Pamela's bad acting but has the action scenes and cheesy lines that make it fun as well. This movie is a retelling of Cassablanca and isn't so quick to hide that fact so I guess this is the exotic remake. Pam Anderson is a sexy female lead and isn't that hard to believe that at times she can be tough she does wear that leather well I have to admit but some of the way she delivers the lines was a little too Shaquil O'Neil I think if you're going to do a movie like this you might as well go over the top go a little James Woods it's all good. But we need a fun action film with the lead being female just sad that this is a bad film that got overlooked. Set in 2017 during the Second American Civil War Barb Wire owns the Hammerhead a nightclub in Steel Harbor the last free city in a United States ravaged by the civil war and she brings in extra cash by hiring out as a mercenary and bounty hunter. Her club is raided by Chief of Police Willis who is looking for the fugitive Dr. Corrina Cora Devonshire. Devonshire a former government scientist has information about a bioweapon being developed by her former superior Colonel Pryzer of the Congressional Directorate she is trying to escape to Canada in order to make this information public. Meanwhile Devonshire has turned up at the Hammerhead. She is accompanied by Axel Hood a freedom fighter whom Barb had known at the outbreak of the war but the two were separated soon afterward. Axel is now married to Cora and is trying to help her get to Canada. They are trying to find a contraband pair of contact lenses which will allow Cora to evade the retinal scan at the Steel Harbor airport. The lenses pass through the hands of several lowlifes before also ending up at Barb's nightclub.Barb Wire really wasn't as bad as I was expecting even though it's just a remake of a classic romantic movie it does have some cool moments. I loved some of the action scenes the fight on the fork lift was a lot of fun to watch and since the movie doesn't take itself too seriously it's all good and makes the fight scenes that more exciting. I guess I could say that I enjoyed the movie a little bit I suppose it's a new guilty pleasure. Pam Anderson may be an awful actress but it's not like I was looking for an Oscar worth movie when I decided to watch it. But I have a feeling that the director has some serious sexual issues considering some of the strange erotic torture devices used in the film are a bit much maybe I don't want to know. If you have an open mind and are looking for a good bad film I think you'll get a kick out Barb Wire. However just think if you're looking for an actual action film with good acting just look at the cover enough said.510".

Of course if you expect a great film you certainly will be disappointed the set decoration is pretty cheap and the plot is stolen from Casablanca.

	schema:reviewBody "Picture this a Pamela Anderson science fiction double bill on television. I mean you'd just HAVE to watch it wouldn't you? Just to see how bad it was.1995's Naked Souls kept making me look for the TV Movie credit that wasn't there. A cheap and exploitative erotic thriller where Pammie exposes her left breast within the first three minutes of the movie. Anderson is an artist specialising in plastercasting nude women rubbing mixture over their breasts while they proclaim it feels kinda sexy. Her boyfriend decently played by Brian Krause is studying brain wave patterns and accidentally crosses his own with that of a serial killer. It's all very silly and derivative also involving a Faustian pact with a mysterious benefactor. What disturbs is that all the victims of the killer are nude women  I mean who gets into a swimming pool naked?  meaning the film uses sexual violence as titillation. Dean Stockwell in a minor role is wasted in stuff like this.If Anderson's role in the predictable Naked Souls was peripheral and also completely irrelevant to the plot then Barb Wire sees her take over the screen. Released the following year this saw the now Pamela Anderson Lee as the titular character a Barbarella of the 90s. Of course she can't act  she only manages one expression throughout the whole two hours  but her assured performance is wonderful here. While it's easy to lump both these films together as trash entertainment Barb Wire is so much more than that. A vibrant witty and welldirected cartoon for the screen its constant energy is a delight. What really appeals is in seeing the sheer amount of cinema pastiches the film rigs up. Batman Never Say Never Again and even The ATeam are all parodied. But most significantly it shares multiple plot similarities with Casablanca and I honestly suspect that this was intentional. Or would its 2017 planes really be so oldfashioned? Barb is a neutral bar owner during a war by day ring a bell? a vixen for hire by night. The landscape she occupies is an excitingly neon world of legalised prostitution engineered diseases and sophisticated contact lenses.Maybe the opening moments  Anderson Lee exposing her bare nipples while water washes over them to a baying crowd  are tacky and unnecessary. The scenes that follow also contain a torture sequence that is not only misguided in its attempt to arouse but also transparent in its purpose for expository dialogue. Yet beyond those first few scenes we have an action movie that contains aboveaverage scripting for the genre and some fun moments. It's amusing to try and guess whether Pam knew she was being kitsch or whether she genuinely believed she was giving a good performance. But whatever the answer it still gets a laugh when a rowdy customer finds his genitals in the mouth of her rabid Rottweiler. Sit she tells the dog much to the drunk's displeasure. Now you don't want to see her roll over do you?All the criticisms that can be made against this film  that it's badly acted appallingly scripted dumb and sexist even though none of them are 100 true anyway  can be disputed by the fact that it's SUPPOSED to be badly acted appallingly scripted dumb and sexist. This is a film that never pretends to be anything other than a pumpedup camp and downright silly movie. What's more it succeeds in being more entertaining and convincing than many of the straight versions of the same format with particular note drawn to it's fight scenes. They may be excessive and lack maturity but they're shot beautifully and are fun to watch. I'm not a huge fan of action pictures but I thoroughly enjoyed this one. If you want a film that possesses depth and integrity then see something else. If you want a lovably stupid movie with Pamela Anderson sticking out her little finger as she burns rubber on a motorbike then watch this. Tremendous fun.".

Pamela also resembles the comic book Barb to an uncanny degree and the supporting cast is wonderfully cartoony.

I realize that it isn't high art but this movie just has a level of silliness and seriousness that's hard not to like. The music story and dialogue all give the movie its cheesiness and in some way it's made to be entertaining.Pam is extremely sexy in this movie and great to watch. She has a scowl all the time and is dressed to kill in low cut tight outfits. Sadly we don't get that much nudity which alone could have carried the movie. The scenes where there is some it's pretty clear and we get a good look at Pamela's incredible body and the atmosphere and her poses are always very sexy. But there isn't enough of this. It's a fun blend of action silly dialogue nudity and... well Pamela Anderson. Go rent it. It's not a great movie but it's not a terrible one and one that's a heck of a good time. NOTE I suggest the unrated version. It contains more nudity there isn't that much to begin with and a ten minutes of footage at the end with Pamela nude in a bathtub which is really great.".

If you get distracted and call Ms. Wire the dreaded B word you may find yourself dealing with her nastytempered Rottweiler Camille a sidekick with bite. This highly anticipated comicbook actionadventure starring the pinup star of Baywatch lasted only a short time in theaters before going bust so to speak. I'm sure the backers couldn't care less as their investment was made back in advance by tremendous worldwide sales. Barb Wire was sold on the star's face and form long before there was a story concept or anything resembling a script. Good thing too. Yes the futuristic plot does bear some parallels to Casablanca but the family resemblance is strictly skindeep. Barb is a nightclub owner who helps an old flame now a freedom fighter and his wife escape from a corrupt police official and some neoNazi types. Of all the gin joints in the world Axel had to walk into Barb's. Barb has just been hosed down while performing a torrid dance onstage and is feeling well charitable. The movie gets off to a pretty good start with tongue well in cheek but grows wearisome when it forgets to laugh at itself. The explosions shootouts and chases are eventually numbing. Must say however I did love the deathbyspikeheel scene which comes early on. Steve Railsback as the head meanie Colonel Pryzer comes across as Tommy Lee Joneslite. Ms. Anderson Lee as Barb the Buxom is game however firing oversized weapons and kicking fanny without mussing her makeup. Too bad they couldn't afford some better wigs for her stunt doubles.".

However when a former government scientist named Dr. Corina Devonshire Victoria Rowell escapes from the Congressional Directoret and arrives in Steel Harbor carrying some special contact lenses worth 2 millionalong with Barb Wire's former lover named Axel Hood Temuera MorrisonBarb Wire becomes indirectly involved. And that spells bad news for whichever side she's not on. Anyway rather than reveal the rest of the details and possibly spoil the film for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this movie was widely panned by the critics when it first came out. As a matter of fact Pamela Anderson received several Razzie Awards for her performance which included Worst New Star and Worst Actress. Other Razzie Awards for the film included Worst Picture along with being nominated for Worst Screenplay and Worst Original Song. So judging from these awards and nominations one would think that this was an extremely bad movie. However rather than simply going with the proverbial crowd I happen to have my own opinion which is quite different. First I didn't think her performance was that bad. As a matter of fact I kind of enjoyed it. Not only that but I have seen a lot worse movies than this particular one. Now that's not to say that this film was great by any means because it clearly wasn't. But it was hardly the worst movie for that year. Nowhere close. Likewise although I didn't especially care for the performance of Temuera Morrison I thought the performance of Udo Kier as Curly was actually quite good. Anyway there you have it. Again while Barb Wire may not be a great film I didn't think it was necessarily that bad either. I rate it as average.".

It's Pamela's film pure and simple.It wouldn't be overstating it to say that I thought the opening credit sequence was quite good. Pamela in tight black leather half out of her top being soaked by a hose? I would say there's four good ideas in there all in one. Unfortunately this is where the film peaks and we are only two minutes in. Sadly a story kicks in at this point and spoils things. But seriously Ms Anderson is perfect for this flick. Her pneumatic figure couldn't be any better for the role she's playing. She is quite ridiculously sexy throughout the entire picture and the film frankly flags when she is not on screen. She is more than serviceable in this action role too. It's worth pointing out here that I am a big Russ Meyer fan and therefore it's perhaps no surprise that I have a huge weakness for dangerous sexy buxom women. The biggest compliment I can pay Pammy therefore is that on this showing she would not have looked out of place as one of the lead bad girls in 'Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill!' High praise but quite frankly true.The only criticism I can level at Pamela here is she doesn't get naked enough.".

This was her naked scifi Hollywood film the opening of the movie shows her stripping showing her breasts and getting hit with water. Ooooh so sexy. This was probably the one scene many kids watched over and over. The film itself is regarded as one of those it's so bad it's good. I can totally see that and once I got pass Anderson's wooden acting I actually enjoyed myself. Guilty as charged.I said I would have loved this when it first came out. I say that because I was around 10 years old and a film like this that is drenched in so called sexiness would have been imprinted on my mind. Seeing it for the first time in full when I'm 22 went to film school and have been on the internet since I was whatever age the film doesn't strike me as sexy. Anderson does look good though and seeing her prance around in tight leather doesn't hurt either. Much better than what Halle Berry tried to do with Catwoman. Anderson became famous for her breasts and that was the focus of the film. Every other shot is of her massive cleavage. Am I complaining? Not really. But we have porno for that the catch is that Anderson is someone somewhat famous. There is a special feature on the DVD called SEXY OUTTAKES. This is ten minutes long and it is of her stripping with the water. Basically the entire opening but for ten minutes. Jango Fett from the Star Wars prequels is in this film I found myself saying Hey it's that guy a lot every time a character came on screen. The film is campy what else do I need to say? The acting is campy the script is godawful and taken from Casablanca the nudity isn't even that good. I expected more the film feels like a tease. Barb Wire is like Showgirls. Made to appeal to the perverted crowd only this one has explosions. I'm giving this one a high rating for it's campiness feel. It's trash but golden trash.".

Clearly there is no relevant story in the movie all revolves around Barb to show her off in different ways. The mentioned costumes are almost offending to the audience. Whoever responsible for them clearly did not work very hard. Barb competes with herself to wear some leatherthing that shows off as much as possible but actually must be considered well dressed as compared to other ladies. The villains wear something that bear a striking resemblance to naziuniforms. Well sure we know who's the bad guys thank you. And some other people wear broken calculators and other piece of machinery that you'll find in a scrapheap as hats and are automatically dressed up like guys from the future. If it was this easy to make a good movie I could have made it myself. Fortunately it is not and Barb Wire is not a good movie.But and this is a mysterious but I actually didn't get bored out of my mind and switched off. The movie actually in some way had some small piece of entertainment value throughout that made me stay. And that something whatever it was is what ultimately saves the movie from being complete junk.So if you have absolutely nothing else to do you may want to watch this one once. You may get some ideas how to or not to dress for the next masquerade.310".

In fact I didn't expect more of the movie than to see Pamela Anderson naked. That was the primary reason I bought it no reason to deny that. But the movie was just so entertaining in every scene there was something so ridiculous that you couldn't help laughing at it. And that's the point. Don't sit down and analyze this movie save that for intelligent movies. I knew from the very first scene that this wasn't going to be intelligent or great or whatever. But it was fun to watch and it does have a plot and scenes that go together to create a meaning which is more than what could be said about several new moviesScary movie 2 just to name one. I didn't for one single scene find it to be boring slow or just the least bit intelligent. And that's exactly what it was made to be. Entertainment. Nothing more.As an added bonus it has some great parodies on Bond and Batman movies. You should definitely watch it if you're into B moviesnormally I'm not but this was just too good to miss. 710".

Many longtime adult film fans regard this as their favorite Metzger movie undoubtedly based on a couple of knockout erotic sequences that are among the most memorable he  or any other carnal creator for that matter  has ever put upon the blue screen. Personally I think the film is a bit uneven with a faltering narrative primarily designed to accommodate the required number of frequently hot sex scenes which makes it forever a runnerup to the likes of MISTY and THE PRIVATE AFTERNOONS OF PAMELA MANN.Exception to the rule is the first 20 minutes or so set in the restaurant where celebrity prostitute   la Xaviera Hollander  Barbara Broadcast industry icon Annette Haven is interviewed by eager beaver journalist C.J. Laing. This lengthy sequence is bustling with all sorts of naughtiness rendered even more arousing by the surreal humor sprouting from the casual attitude adopted by the participants like an extended version of MISTY's airplane footage. Customer Zebedy Colt who played the bisexual manservant in Gerard Damiano's STORY OF JOANNA is served lunch in the form of waitress Clea Carson a reliable secondstringer in both Armand Weston's TAKE OFF and Chuck Vincent's BAD PENNY. Wellendowed waiter Peter Andrews nicknamed the Horse for obvious reasons memorable as the star's partner in the opening scene of ALL ABOUT GLORIA LEONARD supplies his own brand of salad dressing on the spot before he's whisked away by extremely hungry customer Susan McBain the lonely call girl from Damiano's ODYSSEY for one of the all time great oral encounters. She also has one of the film's funniest lines as she remarks how you really have to keep track of your waiter at a Caucasian restaurant because they all tend to look alike ! A lovely black actress identified in the credits as Shirley Peters who also appeared with Harry Reems in Tim McCoy's ultraobscure EROTIC DR. JEKYLL shows up for her salad at Barbara's table but is quickly distracted by the amorous advances of handsome Alan Marlow. Waitresses break dishes all over the place for which they have to pay the Maitre d' the late Bobby Astyr in kind and admirers watch for a youthful David Savage the frisky office boy who kept unloading onto secretary Day Jason's face in one of PAMELA MANN's most memorable running jokes keep interrupting Barbara's interview for signatures and a little head ! The pace and structure of this entire sequence shows Metzger at his finest and made me wish the whole film had been like that.Unfortunately the movie tends to fall apart somewhat at this point or at least settles into a more conventional adult film format. Barbara excuses herself to turn a trick across town at the office of busy business man Michael Gaunt an excellent actor in Richard Mahler's American BABYLON that is almost entirely devoid of dialog in sharp contrast to the previous scene. C.J. a vastly underrated performer with a distinctly submissive slant in fabulously filthy fare like Shaun Costello's SLAVE OF PLEASURE does her one better however in the legendary kitchen encounter with sweaty dishwasher Wade Nichols star of Chuck Vincent's ambitious VISIONS. Great buildup as they longingly stare at each other from across the steamfilled room. Laing grins in defiance as she squats to urinate into a bowl before receiving a killer rectal reaming that's on pretty much everyone's short list for best sex scene ever.It's off to the disco next with Annette and C.J. making out on the dance floor while burly guys armwrestle at a nearby table huh ? oblivious to the girls' groping. They retreat to a stairwell where they are joined by Barbara's business partner Jamie Gillis for an intriguingly shot threesome that employs extreme closeups to obscure the identity of the participants for a good part of the scene. Finally Jamie and Annette flash back in horror to their experiences with a stuckup PAP Protestant American Princess who worked for them just an excuse to stick in some leftover footage from MISTY with Jamie and Constance Money that's heavy on BD with ropes and nipple clamps. After that the movie just stops rather than ends.The way I see it Metzger got a bit frustrated with the limitations of the hardcore format having taken it as far as he could go with MISTY. The luxurious restaurant scenes shot in the grand lobby of New York's bankrupt and boarded up Royal Manhattan Hotel at 44th and 8th  furnishings and fancy dinner ware being actively auctioned off while filming was still very much in progress !  currently living out its life as the Milford Plaza as was part of his last porn film MARASCHINO CHERRY shot semisimultaneously but released the following year suggest that he entered into the project with great enthusiasm but much of what follows feels slightly formulaic as if he felt thwarted in the lofty ambitions he hoped to achieve but couldn't because of time and budgetary restraints not to mention MISTY's arduous postproduction period. Don't get me wrong it's still a terrific adult film. Lighting and cinematography in particular are as good as you're ever going to find in the porno field.".

The film does attempt to be a bit more than merely another porn flick and it seems like the director is trying to make some sort of social commentary though of course the sex is always the star and for the most of the duration I couldn't really care much less about what the film is trying to say. In terms of the sex scenes themselves I have to say that there isn't much here that I haven't seen already in other porn films but what makes this one stand out really is the music which features throughout most of the film and gives it a feeling all of it's own. The film is a bit choppy and doesn't really follow a strict narrative  there are times when you are likely to know what is going on and many when you won't have a clue. I can certainly recommend that hardcore fans check this one out because it is well worth seeing but I wouldn't put it at the very top of the genre.".

Waiters and waitresses stop by tables quite frequently to satisfy their customers or find somebody who can in due time and quickwitted questions like Barbara is your business still open for pleasure? and It's past my headtime are exchanged amongst waitresses and customers.Director Radley Metzger who gave us the decorative and elaborate pornographic film The Opening of Misty Beethoven gives us Barbara Broadcast in the same sort of light and position as his other films. For one this film is captured in a surrealist state of mind in a world where casual sex most specifically public sex isn't a taboo or something to bat an eye at. Metzger keenly imagines a world robbed of the societal taboos and double takes people do upon seeing public displays of affection much less sex. Secondly he conducts everything in a very beautiful almost picturesque manner with soft lighting not overembellishing the light colors onscreen and very moodsensitive music to compliment the decadent setting.Our titular character is played by Annette Haven and is being interviewed by a local women determined to get to the bottom of Barbara's seasoned history as a server of her valued customers. Right in the middle of her interview Barbara stops to give a young customer a blowjob and immediately after asking is he could finish in her mouth she stops her performance to say that he is not old enough. How old do I have to be to cum in a woman's mouth the young customer asks Barbara. Old enough not to ask she states before batting her eyes and devoting her undivided attention back to her interview.Metzger who serves as the film's writer and director joyfully plays with the film's tone here and doesn't skimp on the eroticism. While a plethora of sex scenes have that occasionally jarring series of closeups on the actions but Metzger is always one to make his sex whatever the position or the situation classy in a way that a great deal of early pornography could struggle with. Consider the sex scenes of Mona the Virgin Nymph a film I proclaimed limp and remarkably forgettable had it not been the first pornographic film to obtain a wide theatrical release in theaters. That film beared so many washed out sex scenes ruined by angles and cloying music.Barbara Broadcast has a much more elegant presentation with sex scenes that emphasize eroticism music that is actually immersive to what's occurring on screen and a plot that's somewhat interesting based on the simultaneous inanity and the destruction of sexual taboos. With this and The Opening of Misty Beethoven Metzger has firmly shown his true colors for pornographic filmmaking and they are colors that shine brighter than a great deal of his contemporaries.Starring Annette Haven.

	schema:headline " What is evil?";
	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERSI keep saying nonsecular when I mean secular so I'm going to have to be especially careful when talking about this final in the trilogy which has been shown on telly for consecutive weekends on the graveyard shift. The other two were made in the seventies thus bestowing coolness upon them. At the start of the film Damien is sitting in a viewing theatre and is somewhat miffed. Trite cliched inane he complains. But enough about 'The Final Conflict' Damien what about the advert you just watched? The eighties are truly upon us and are apocalyptic. Poor Sam Neill was described as a 'hacktor' after appearing in this but just how do you go about playing the AntiChrist? Dracula disappears for most of Bram Stoker's novel to great effect and the best move would have been to do a 'Dead Zone' type plot with one man having visions after shaking his hand and trying to off him for the duration with Damien very much in the background. Instead Neill goes for a hilarious pantomime turn of twitches eyeball rolling furtive glances and failed charm. All that is missing are the cape mustache and tall black hat. His speech is mannered. The daggers are the only thing on EARTH...pause...that can kill me. DANDAN! Not the only thing script starvation is another. This portentousness extends to the incomprehensible Father DeCarlo. The mark 66.....long pause...6! Did he forget? It's not like a long zip code is it? What you also don't want to do is hire a British tv director Graham Baker to direct a genre he is unfamiliar with. The action mostly revolves around people coming in and going out through doors and the setups are flat. Hey Graham horror films have lightening don't they? So bung them in too in a highly risible manner knocking a man off his feet in Keystone Cops fashion. Another problem is Jerry Goldsmith's score which makes an old style Ben Hur epic sound like a mere tap on the door. It's deafening appearances during the staid proceedings is laughably incongruous.The devil changes his modus operandi in this film. Why the change from crow to dog? Well in a recent London stand up comedy act a comedian found that the duck he hired cost 250 a day 100 more than the Equity standard actor's pay for a WEEKS work. So he hired an actor in a duck's costume I kid you not. So the change to a dog is not just satanic it's smart. This dog is unusual though it's point of view shot when stalking the American Ambassador in Hyde Park appears to be floating at least a foot off the ground and doesn't disturb twigs. Damien later explains that the breed once marched with the imperial Roman army. Must have been a sight a load of soldiers with a row of dogs floating in the air. Keeps the sand off their paws I guess. But a man's best friend is not his dog but his personal secretary. Harvey Dean for it is he reminds me of the hilariously inept personal secretary played by Barry Foster in the 'Sweeney!' Film only going one better and adding baby killing to his CV. The nonetoobright Dean happily twitters on to Damien about family life seemingly unaware unlike the rest of us that the devil has a propensity towards nihilism. But unlike Barry Foster Dean's assassins are competent and it's the God Squad's on a sacred mission that are inept. And don't say they're not used to that sort of thing have you forgotten the Spanish Inquisition? Anyway one of DeCarlo's priests goes to kill Damien in a tv studio. From ahem a gantry. What was he planning to do jump down break both his legs then crawl over to Damien and try and stab his toes? Embarrassed by this incompetence Father DeCarlo tells the other priests that this time they're going to plan things down to the finest detail. So two of them wait in some ruins while another priest lures Damien to his demise. Sadly they get stuck in a hole doomed to starvation. But hang on doesn't planning down to the finest detail entail everyone knowing where they were heading thus ensuring a search party? But it's only me who thinks of these little things such as Damien moaning to Dean that Christians like sticking to the letter of their prophecies. But do they? Killing Damien on consecrated ground and crucifying him with all seven daggers seems to have gone out of the window. Also 'Revelations' states that Christ will do battle with the AntiChrist but he doesn't. Probably because he's a little short. In fact he's a baby a salient point lost on our Damien who stalks through an Abbey yelling come out and face me Nazarene! Er Damien he's a baby. He can't even walk yet. Do you expect one of the priests to run out and try and nut you with him? Instead Damien is stabbed in the back by a journalist. Honestly as the son of Satan he really should have seen THAT one coming.This film bludgeons you with pious scriptures and pompous choirs but is hypocritically exploitative. The series was silly but tapped into superstitions supposedly forgotten in this secular yes made it! age so it's a shame they went for easy sleazy rather than something thoughtful. What if as a recent song writer posed you had to believe in Jesus and the saints? If it was all true? The theological moral and historical implications would have made for some philosophically interesting films. 'The Final Conflict' throws away the really big philosophical question of history what is evil? Damien says that true evil is as pure as innocence and that people confuse it with their own lusts and perversions. The trouble is Damien has a statue of Christ crucified the wrong way to a cross and also sodomises his girlfriend Kate Reynolds telling her birth is pain life is pain beauty is pain which suggests he's a bit confused as well. But Satan being the father of lies is bound to produce a hypocrite. The other problem with this film is Damien isn't really well evil enough. He's big on hyperbole Grandeur of melancholy divinity of loneliness God doesn't lift a finger to do any housework etc but he's only managed the death of a few relatives himself. What's shocking about being the head of a multinational corporation nowadays? Thorn produces everything from Nuclear weapons to Soya Beans but if you've ever been to supper at my motherinlaws you'll know which is more lethal. Damien involves himself with a coup in Botswana to gain financially for Thorn industries and set himself favourably up with the president while blithely missing the fact that with a bit more effort he could have stirred some real trouble up in the middle East between two of the worlds oldest religions thus precipitating armageddon well ahead of schedule. It does at least prove however that although the devil may have all the best tunes don't hold your breath for the CD he's a real slacker. In fact the most shocking moments in the whole film come when Kate Reynolds a BBC journalist no less! Seems to approve of her son fox hunting and being traditionally blooded and also let's a complete stranger into her house late at night just because he tells her he's a priest. A sobering thought for our nonsecular times. Oh !".

	onyx:emotionText "SPOILERSI keep saying nonsecular when I mean secular so I'm going to have to be especially careful when talking about this final in the trilogy which has been shown on telly for consecutive weekends on the graveyard shift. The other two were made in the seventies thus bestowing coolness upon them. At the start of the film Damien is sitting in a viewing theatre and is somewhat miffed. Trite cliched inane he complains. But enough about 'The Final Conflict' Damien what about the advert you just watched? The eighties are truly upon us and are apocalyptic. Poor Sam Neill was described as a 'hacktor' after appearing in this but just how do you go about playing the AntiChrist? Dracula disappears for most of Bram Stoker's novel to great effect and the best move would have been to do a 'Dead Zone' type plot with one man having visions after shaking his hand and trying to off him for the duration with Damien very much in the background. Instead Neill goes for a hilarious pantomime turn of twitches eyeball rolling furtive glances and failed charm. All that is missing are the cape mustache and tall black hat. His speech is mannered. The daggers are the only thing on EARTH...pause...that can kill me. DANDAN! Not the only thing script starvation is another. This portentousness extends to the incomprehensible Father DeCarlo. The mark 66.....long pause...6! Did he forget? It's not like a long zip code is it? What you also don't want to do is hire a British tv director Graham Baker to direct a genre he is unfamiliar with. The action mostly revolves around people coming in and going out through doors and the setups are flat. Hey Graham horror films have lightening don't they? So bung them in too in a highly risible manner knocking a man off his feet in Keystone Cops fashion. Another problem is Jerry Goldsmith's score which makes an old style Ben Hur epic sound like a mere tap on the door. It's deafening appearances during the staid proceedings is laughably incongruous.The devil changes his modus operandi in this film. Why the change from crow to dog? Well in a recent London stand up comedy act a comedian found that the duck he hired cost 250 a day 100 more than the Equity standard actor's pay for a WEEKS work. So he hired an actor in a duck's costume I kid you not. So the change to a dog is not just satanic it's smart. This dog is unusual though it's point of view shot when stalking the American Ambassador in Hyde Park appears to be floating at least a foot off the ground and doesn't disturb twigs. Damien later explains that the breed once marched with the imperial Roman army. Must have been a sight a load of soldiers with a row of dogs floating in the air. Keeps the sand off their paws I guess. But a man's best friend is not his dog but his personal secretary. Harvey Dean for it is he reminds me of the hilariously inept personal secretary played by Barry Foster in the 'Sweeney!' Film only going one better and adding baby killing to his CV. The nonetoobright Dean happily twitters on to Damien about family life seemingly unaware unlike the rest of us that the devil has a propensity towards nihilism. But unlike Barry Foster Dean's assassins are competent and it's the God Squad's on a sacred mission that are inept. And don't say they're not used to that sort of thing have you forgotten the Spanish Inquisition? Anyway one of DeCarlo's priests goes to kill Damien in a tv studio. From ahem a gantry. What was he planning to do jump down break both his legs then crawl over to Damien and try and stab his toes? Embarrassed by this incompetence Father DeCarlo tells the other priests that this time they're going to plan things down to the finest detail. So two of them wait in some ruins while another priest lures Damien to his demise. Sadly they get stuck in a hole doomed to starvation. But hang on doesn't planning down to the finest detail entail everyone knowing where they were heading thus ensuring a search party? But it's only me who thinks of these little things such as Damien moaning to Dean that Christians like sticking to the letter of their prophecies. But do they? Killing Damien on consecrated ground and crucifying him with all seven daggers seems to have gone out of the window. Also 'Revelations' states that Christ will do battle with the AntiChrist but he doesn't. Probably because he's a little short.

	schema:headline " The Antichrist Ups The Ante OR Getting His Kicks On Route 666";
	schema:reviewBody "By the end of the 1976 megahit The Omenone of the most successful films of that year returning 60 million in domestic box office receipts on its 3 million budgetthe foster parents of 5yearold Damien Thorn both lay dead...as well as most of the personages who had had anything to do with the kindergartenage Antichrist. His mother Katherine Lee Remick had been offed by the literal nanny from hell Mrs. Baylock a remarkable performance from Billie Whitelaw while his ambassador father Robert played with classy gravitas by the great Gregory Peck had been killed by the cops while in the act of attempting to slay his adopted Satan spawn with one of the Daggers of Megiddo. By the conclusion of the film's sequel 1978's Damien Omen II the guardians of 12yearold Damien also lay dead Uncle Richard William Holden had been knifed by wife Ann Lee Grant while Ann herself had perished in a conflagration. Viewers would have to wait another three years to see what deviltry young Damien would be up to next but were well repaid for their patience when part three of the trilogy The Final Conflict was released in March 1981. The film performed only 13 as well at the box office as compared to the original Omen installment and does not seem to be highly regarded today which surprises me. The picture certainly does up the ante of the previous two films and while necessarily not as original or fresh in conception more than makes up for that with some truly shocking developments.In the film the viewer learns that Damien has graduated from both Yale and Oxford is now in his early 30s and as portrayed remarkably well by Sam Neill is not only the supremely wealthy head of the Thorn business empire but in consequence of the Satanically induced suicide of the U.S. ambassador to Britain is next in line for that august position as well. The film basically consists of two running parallel plots. In the first Father De Carlo the great Italian actor Rossano Brazzi giving the film's most likable performance head of the San Benedetto monastery in Subiaco Italy which featured prominently in the original film along with six select priests each armed with one of the seven Daggers of Megiddo go out into the world to slay the Antichrist. In the second Damien searches throughout London to find the newly born Christ child and to slay him before his own powers are greatly diminished. He is abetted by his personal assistant Harvey Dean some nice work here by Don Gordon whose own newly born son may or may not be the Christ child himself while British investigative reporter Kate Reynolds Lisa Harrow interviews the new ambassador and learns a little too much about him. And so a genuine conflict arises Can Damien kill the newborn Christ before the seven priests kill him?Unlike the previous two films here we have a Damien in full knowledge and acceptance of his Satanic lineage. For the first time the Antichrist doesn't just slay the pesky meddlers surrounding him but actively goes after Jesus Christ himself! THAT'S what I call upping the ante! As in the previous films Damien's and his Pops' slayings make for memorable set pieces and the deaths of the Subiaco priests are brought about most impressively by fire knifing lightning dog attack and so on. Surprisingly however these infernal homicides are not the film's most gripping scenes. Ratherat least for this viewerit is the pair of speeches that Damien makes that manages to impress the most. In the first he addresses a Jesus crucifix with the most shockingly abusive language calling Christianity a grubby mundane creed and declaring ...2000 years have been enough...Nazarene charlatan since the hour you vomited forth from a gaping wound of a woman you've done nothing but drown Man's soaring desires in a deluge of sanctimonious morality...I will drive deeper the thorns into your rancid carcass you profaner of vices.... After which Damien Thorn a genuine thorn in mankind's backside does indeed drive the thorn crown on the Christ effigy deeper into Jesus' head remarkably making the image cry bloody tears! It is a flabbergasting sequence supremely well performed by Neill. And in his other great speech Damien exhorts his heterogeneous minions to track down and slay the new Christ child with these words ...Slay the Nazarene and you will know the violent raptures of my father's kingdom. Fail and you will be condemned to a numbing eternity in the flaccid bosom of Christ. For the first time thus the viewer is witness to a genuinely evil Damien one who is not only fully aware of his devilish ancestry but reveling in it. The Final Conflict besides showcasing some shocking violence and speechifying is perhaps most startling in its willingness to feature infanticide as a subplot indeed by the film's end no less than a dozen male infants have been exterminated throughout England in Damien's quest to eliminate the Christ child! Screenwriter Andrew Birkin's script certainly does not flinch from taking risks here and he is ably complemented by some nice work from director Graham Barker and still another fine score from Jerry Goldsmith. Oh...and for all the gals out there who are attracted to socalled bad boys in this film they will get to see what a bout of lovemaking with the ultimate bad boy might be like. And for once we have an Omen film that ends on a happy noteeven Damien himself smiles as one of those blessed daggers plunges into his back! Damien may finally be vanquished here but for those viewers who are interested in seeing what kind of mischief his demon daughter Delia is capable of spreading there is always the TV sequel Omen IV The Awakening....".

	schema:reviewBody "Damien Thorn is a full grown man and recently appointed Ambassador to Great Britain the same position his father had years ago. And he is fully aware of his unholy destiny as the Antichrist the false prophet. He has carefully been studying the signs for Jesus Christ's return to Earth and has decided the time is near. He sends his disciples all across Great Britain when an alignment of stars signifies his birth to kill any baby boy born on the morning of March 24 between the hours of midnight and six o'clock. Even one of Damien's closest assistants son is not exempt from this decree.But Damien's human side is getting the better of him as he starts seeing the popular journalist Kate Reynolds and they begin a relationship. He also forms an attachment to her son Peter whom Damien takes under his wing and manipulates for his own evil.While this is going on the seven daggers of Megiddo have been rediscovered from the rubble of the old Thorn Museum which was burnt down in the last film. They are bought out of an auction and are sent to the Monastery that Damien's father visited when he was investigating the truth behind his son. Seven priests led by Father DeCarlo go to Britain and resolve to finish what Robert Thorn and his brother Richard started by killing Damien and reassuring the second coming of the Messiah. The plot for Omen 3 has a lot going for it but there's a lot of things that could've been done that weren't even touched upon. The relationship between Kate and Damien could've been an emotional struggle to the story since it could allude that Damien might achieve redemption due to their relationship. Even one of his associates say that Reynolds is dangerous to be around but Damien is resolute in his path and not even 'love' can affect him. The priests are underdeveloped as well. Six are killed off rather quickly and DeCarlo isn't as strong a protagonist as Robert or Richard Thorn. The once brilliant supernatural death scenes that The Omen series is famous for are sort of replaced by intentional murders and accidents. Some are still impressive but they lose the sense of demonic intervention that the other two films had. Instead it is either Damien showing off his power or one of his disciples that commits a murder. There's not a lot of speculation in them in that they all don't look like they could be common accidents. However the film does have its fair share of disturbing scenes. There's a scene where a woman sees a vision of her baby burnt. She then takes an iron and approaches the baby and the rest is left to our imagination. Another scene involves Damien on a hunt with a group of Beagles. Two priests ambush him and while he kill one of them off himself he tells the pack to kill the other and they proceed to tear him apart. The acting in the film is also quite good. Sam Neill as Damien provides a dark and rather frightening performance for the now adult Antichrist and he does an excellent job throughout the movie. The rest of the cast perform their roles well but there's nothing that really stands out in the ensemble. Jerry Goldsmith provides us with another excellent score that builds up suspense and makes it clear that evil is at work. For all three movies his score remains as one of the best in the Horror genre.Overall The Final Conflict has a lot of problems but the film isn't entirely bad. It's worth watching to bring a conclusion to The Omen series but will probably leave a few fans wanting a better ending.".

	schema:headline " Packed With ThoughtProvoking Symbolism";
	schema:reviewBody "Of course Michael York's version of The Final Conflict was much more literally on the mark even though Sam Neill's no less chillingly charmingly magnetic performance was packed with an even more indepth thoughtprovoking element of symbolism. In this connection beyond the drawing of a few logically plausible inferences in conjunction with various questions of military strategy it would be quite an ambitious leap to attempt a clinically psychological analysis of Satan. It's certainly beyond much real doubt that having lost everything he'd been so abundantly handed on a proverbial silver platter he was again as Damien so passionately expressed it in a bit of his own kind of agony although for all that there were apparently no regrets except for what only his enormous pride as so well expressed by Milton had blinded him to foreseeingnamely the inherent inevitability of his losing the War in Heaven he started. Thereafter the thought of anything short of taking what he wanted by force had still been no less unbearably demeaning and compromising to him particularly in the form of his having rather attempted to more honestly earn his rightful place God's way although about as selfcompromisingly albeit unavoidably one can just about hear him even now putting his enormous rhetorical skills into action once they'd been about all he'd had left by way of personal defense in his argument to the effect that it was God and not he who amounted to the real Tyrant! . . . Moreover now that Satan has had about sixthousand years to no less incorrigibly continue inadvertently proving himself so categorically deadwrong one should not even need the prophecy so graciously provided in advance as to how utterly unbroken he shall prove to have been even subsequent to a yet future onethousand year period of confinement in the Bottomless Pit of Revelation 2013!Which is undoubtedly one important reason from among others too fascinatingly lengthy to delineate here why God patterned the prophetic sequence of events in precisely this way in answer to the logical question of at least a few as to whether it would have done any good for even the Infinite Compassion of God to have provided some kind of savior or whatever even for him that is merely assuming but only in the most academically insoluble sense that such a thing would have been possible at all or at least somehow provided for under an alternativelypredetermined Plan had the Lord foreseen such a fruitfullyredeeming necessity to have been the case. . . . However either way one can be certain that God takes no pleasure in having to forfeit any of His most magnificently angelic creations just as He considered Satan to have been no less personally than symbolically judicially and even didactically more than worth the kind of sixthousandyear Trial of the Ages at human expense which is now about near its end. Of course God had been sporting enough in the process to have given Adam the choice as to whether each individual's morally free options would subsequently have to be decided on the easy road rather than the hard one one which could have rather resulted in Satan's having lost his wager right on the spot thereafter no longer to have been potentially useful for anything eitherother than the Lake of FireRevelation 2010! Afterall Adam's choice could not have been a real one if this hadn't also constituted a correspondingly real possibility. But alas it didn't actually materialize afterall! . . . Finally there's no comparing the Fairest of Trials having been granted by the alleged Tyrant God to Satan with the kind of Trial Satan delivered to the Only Begotten Son of God in return!

	onyx:emotionText "Of course Michael York's version of The Final Conflict was much more literally on the mark even though Sam Neill's no less chillingly charmingly magnetic performance was packed with an even more indepth thoughtprovoking element of symbolism. In this connection beyond the drawing of a few logically plausible inferences in conjunction with various questions of military strategy it would be quite an ambitious leap to attempt a clinically psychological analysis of Satan. It's certainly beyond much real doubt that having lost everything he'd been so abundantly handed on a proverbial silver platter he was again as Damien so passionately expressed it in a bit of his own kind of agony although for all that there were apparently no regrets except for what only his enormous pride as so well expressed by Milton had blinded him to foreseeingnamely the inherent inevitability of his losing the War in Heaven he started. Thereafter the thought of anything short of taking what he wanted by force had still been no less unbearably demeaning and compromising to him particularly in the form of his having rather attempted to more honestly earn his rightful place God's way although about as selfcompromisingly albeit unavoidably one can just about hear him even now putting his enormous rhetorical skills into action once they'd been about all he'd had left by way of personal defense in his argument to the effect that it was God and not he who amounted to the real Tyrant! . . . Moreover now that Satan has had about sixthousand years to no less incorrigibly continue inadvertently proving himself so categorically deadwrong one should not even need the prophecy so graciously provided in advance as to how utterly unbroken he shall prove to have been even subsequent to a yet future onethousand year period of confinement in the Bottomless Pit of Revelation 2013!Which is undoubtedly one important reason from among others too fascinatingly lengthy to delineate here why God patterned the prophetic sequence of events in precisely this way in answer to the logical question of at least a few as to whether it would have done any good for even the Infinite Compassion of God to have provided some kind of savior or whatever even for him that is merely assuming but only in the most academically insoluble sense that such a thing would have been possible at all or at least somehow provided for under an alternativelypredetermined Plan had the Lord foreseen such a fruitfullyredeeming necessity to have been the case. . . . However either way one can be certain that God takes no pleasure in having to forfeit any of His most magnificently angelic creations just as He considered Satan to have been no less personally than symbolically judicially and even didactically more than worth the kind of sixthousandyear Trial of the Ages at human expense which is now about near its end. Of course God had been sporting enough in the process to have given Adam the choice as to whether each individual's morally free options would subsequently have to be decided on the easy road rather than the hard one one which could have rather resulted in Satan's having lost his wager right on the spot thereafter no longer to have been potentially useful for anything eitherother than the Lake of FireRevelation 2010! Afterall Adam's choice could not have been a real one if this hadn't also constituted a correspondingly real possibility. But alas it didn't actually materialize afterall! . . . Finally there's no comparing the Fairest of Trials having been granted by the alleged Tyrant God to Satan with the kind of Trial Satan delivered to the Only Begotten Son of God in return! Additionally just about anybody worth everlastingly salvaging by now should have wellsurpassed Satan's continuing level of denial in his insistence that even democratically capitalistically scientific competition the kind which has allegedly synthesized the principle of universal selfishness with a system of lawful checks and balances which externally if not motivationally serve to prevent the unscrupulous victimization of anybody in the process thus at least potentially opening the way for the individual selfactualization of all is anything better than the inevitably decisively unacceptable failure it is still very terminally proving itself to be. . . .

If that wasn't enough a group of seven priest's from Italy now possess the seven daggers of Meggido which are the only things on Earth which can kill Damien  are on a mission to do just that an Antichrist's life is just never easy is it?This English American coproduction was directed by Graham Baker  I actually thought it was a decent horror film that passed the time harmlessly enough. The Final Conflict was the third entry in The Omen 1976 series of films  while probably not quite as good as the previous two films I don't think it deserves some of the stick it gets I mean what about Omen IV The Awakening 1991 for heavens sake? Anyway the script by Andrew Birkin now has Damien the Antichrist as an adult who has to fend of killer priest's  the birth of the new Christ as well as continuing his quest to wipe out mankind. The one area where The Final Conflict disappoints is that it's not done on a grand enough scale for a film that supposedly deals with the end of the World  ancient religious prophecy's it all feels very flat empty  a bit too basic. For the majority of the film the script offers nothing more than a string of novelty supernatural setpiece deaths which are good to watch but they don't really drive the central story forward until the birth of the second Christ but even then this seems like just an excuse for more deaths  nothing significant becomes of it. Don't get me wrong because as a horror fan I love death gore  mutilation but I must admit I expected something with a bit more resonance. The character's  dialogue are OK but apart from Damien they don't stand out it moves along at a fair pace  has entertainment value although I did think it was a bit too long  the climax is a big let down.Director Baker does a decent job  the film has a nice basic but quite stylish look about it. There isn't much continuity between The Final Conflict  the other Omen films for instance according to the original Omen the Antichrist Damien was born on the 6th June 1966 yet here The Final Conflict is set in 1982  he is said to be 32 years old not that it really matters though. There's a decent atmosphere although I can't say it's particularly scary or tension filled  that ending is very weak which really hurts the film as a whole because you are then stuck with negative feelings as the end credits roll despite what has gone before being alright. There's some good gore here including a burnt corpse  a great scene where someone gorily has their brains blown out I then love how his leg twitches! which is one of those cool film moment bits that is definitely worth watching on DVD  slowmotioning it.Technically The Final Conflict is well made  it obvious had a decent budget. Largely shot in England in London  Cornwall the scenery is nice enough although as a side note Fox hunting as shown in The Final Conflict has since been made illegal so you animal lovers out there needn't worry about such things anymore... The acting is OK but no one stood out apart from Sam Neill in his first starring role  he would obviously go on to achieve lots of success as an actor unlike anyone else in this film. I was surprised to see loud mouth TV show hostess for hire Ruby Wax had a small role in this film...The Final Conflict isn't the greatest film in the World that's for sure but it ain't too bad when all said  done not the ideal way to round the trilogy off but it could have been worse. I'd say it's worth a watch if nothing else. Also known as Omen III The Final Conflict.".

Damien is in full command of his power here and it's exciting to see him at the helm rather than the omnipotent hand of Satan. Of course he still has his minions and another Rottweiler helps him do his bidding but seeing Damien at the head of Thorn Industries and how he worked his rise to power makes for a thrilling way to move the story forward.

He has colleague entanglements as he must kill the child of his assistant to rid the world of Christ he has romantic complications with Kate at one point disturbingly raping her in a bid to show how pain can be beautiful and he ultimately has to face off against God himself. There's a lot more dramatic material there than there ever was in the Final Destinationlike crux of the original two films. The vendetta the seven kamikaze priests vow against Damien also really puts the antiChrist at risk wherein the first two films his safety was always assured. Writer Andrew Birkin most famous for his Peter Pan writings of which you can certainly see lost boys aspects here does a wonderful job of putting it all out on the tablelaying it all on the alter? for one truly thrilling battle for the ages.Not only is the story as sound as ever but horror fans are really going to like the viciousness of the deaths throughout. With the seven vigilante monks going after Damien and Damien himself killing off many others who stand in his way the body count here is quite high and like with the first two films the producers don't hold back in staging an elaborate death scene. Since this had the films of the slasher era to compete with the brutality of the carnage has been upped once more and some of the deaths are quiet unsettling. The most notable being when the ambassador ties tape around the door knobs in his office linking it all to his shotgun trigger so when his colleagues enter his brains get splattered all over the presidential crest. Another sees a woman burn her infant son with a hot iron and we memorably see the charred remains of the baby's face. One more still is when the first priest tries to kill Damien at a TV station slipping up from the rafters and being dangled and burned in plastic as he melts in pain. The effects work is quite accomplished done by A Clockwork Orange makeup artist Freddie Williamson matching the menace of the acts themselves. Even the events that aren't gory still have a sinister quality to them like when Damien after killing an adversary at a fox hunt rubs what he says to be fox blood on the face of a boy in initiation. With that and that uncomfortable rape scene The Final Conflict certainly doesn't play it safe like a Hollywood movie should.A riveting thriller through and grue The Final Conflict certainly lives up to its title and offers Damien a fabulous final send off. The scope is so much larger than the first two films and more than just a thriller it ends up becoming some grand theological statement of our times. It's pretty ballsy for a horror sequel to depict Christ on screen but this one goes one further and gives us an ending so grand and fitting that it looks cut from BenHur. As far as horror sequels go the Omen III is certainly upper echelon. It's a shame it ended when it was just starting to hit its stride but then again given what would follow with the illadvised fourth film maybe they did good and quit while they were ahead. A must see! THE FINAL CONFLICT is quite an interesting film Damien grows up and the series ends on a satisfying note.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Final Conflict 1981 is about Damien Thorne's Sam Neil rise to power and his eventual fall. A brotherhood of monks is preparing to stop Damien from seizing even greater power but his cadre of minions put and end to that. Whilst the surviving monks prepare to confront him again Damien is eliminating the competition and raising up ground support. He wants to make sure that the resurrection never comes to be so he starts to have his goons kill all the male babies. As his power grows so does his ambitions of ruling the world.

But in the end his empire collapses and Damien goes out with a whimper instead of a big bang.I was slightly disappointed by the way the trilogy ended. I new Damien had to go but I thought he would do it with his guns blazing. Oh well they should have left well enough alone because they tried to revive the series with a television movie sequel. That was a bad move on Fox's part. This coaster disc of a D.V.D. can be found in the box set. It's not worth watching. But this one is. It has some nice gory set pieces and Sam Neil's pretty convincing as the Prince of Darkness.Recommended for horror fans.".

	schema:reviewBody "As far as horror films go I believe The Final Conflict has gotten a bad rap. Now this is obviously not some all time greatest movie of all time or anything like that but it really is a well made film and a good horror film. Considering that I only watch horror movies and every review I've done on IMDb has been extremely negative of really horrible horror films hence my name this being the first positive review I've given is really saying something at least for me anyway  In The Final Conflict our hero or rather not I guess since he IS the antiChrist Damien is all grown up and using his demonic ways to basically take over the world for Satan. The one melodramatic scene where he gives his little speech to his father Satan is pretty stupid and could have done without although the scuptlure of Christ in that scnece is actually a pretty amazing work of art but other than that this is a fine horror film. The atmosphere is great decent performances. His scene with the president played by Mason Adams makes you chuckle and ties in so well how all politicians as well as everything to do with politics are so deeply in league with Satan.A couple shocking violent scenes really creepy atmosphere great cinematogrpahy  this film is clearly from an analogue age before digital anything was in use. Perhaps this is part of the reason many don't like this movie today's horror films are a lot easier to make due to digital advances which is a good thing so they appear to have high production quality but are really terrible made written and directed. The final conflict is well made and of course the score by Jerry Goldsmith is excellent and adds much to the film definitely would have been a worse movie without his score I can't say enough how good it is. The mix of very old musical ideas with modern ones as well as a few tritones of course really makes the movie in many ways for me.So see The Final Conflict if your a horror fan.".

	schema:reviewBody "Damien Omen II must reside in the Land of the Worst Sequels of All Time and I absolutely cannot stand people saying that this film was worse. The Final Conflict the startling compelling and above all wellmade conclusion to what should have only been the Omen trilogy is almost as good as the original.As the tagline promises ultimate evil now resides not in a child but in a grown man. And while that idea sounds like a letdown compared to the owleyed coincidence of the character in the original film it serves the purpose of a continuing story far better than having Damien as a boy of 12 and 13. It also provides a semi romantic subplot and it means that the task of killing Damien has just become immensely more difficult.Taking up that holy job is the responsibility of a group of priests carrying Bugenhagen's seven knives led by the evertalented Rossano Brazzi. But there's another threat to the power of evil the Second Coming of Christ. And most of the movie deals with Damien's twisted attempts to find and dispatch the infant Jesus.The music cinematography visual quality and dialogue are infinitely better than those of Damien and even the grandiose moments dealing with Christ's rebirth are legitimately entertaining and make sense within the plot. It also allows for the main character to at last expose the true depths of his villainy and make people talk about how Armageddon is really going to play out.Finally what completely validates this as a great sequel for me is the ending which I won't give away here. All I'll say is that though highly controversial it really pays off and the series couldn't have ended any better.And it certainly didn't Omen IV The Awakening is too mindbogglingly awful for words and the 2006 remake of the original is just plain pathetic. There are only three true Omen movies and only one sequel worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as the original The Final Conflict.".

It implied that the USA would be destroyed once and for all in an all out battle between good and evil. Such was not the case.This story centers around Damien taking the position his father Gregory Peck from the first movie once held as American Ambassador to Britain and the priests who have found the holy daggers which can kill the Antichrist. If you don't expect what the hype offers you won't be too disappointed in this movie. I wasn't disappointed at all. Sam Neill is wonderful in this presentation although the end was a bit trite and way over christianized but you really shouldn't expect anything more from a premise which is based in religiochristian myth.It rates a 6.910 from...the Fiend .".

One of the small problems is the fact that this one doesn't seem to go anywhere while he just spends the entire time pontificating on his mission and journey without actually doing much of any interest. These scenes of him going around his office attempting to explain his plans using his connections with the Biblical passages back to his overall plans which aren't in the slightest bit interesting in the long run of simply being too overlong in the first half. The later parts here are almost as bad with the completely overblown love story and the concurrent plot to deal with the children that just tends to drag on for a while as the discussion of the events plods along with barely anything happening during these scenes. As this is understandable considering the particular storyline portrayed in here this really tends to undermine the whole second half hat really just limps along lifelessly during this half while trying to make the valiant attempts of suspense and mortal terror but never doing anything to do that. That also leads into the last problem here in the film as it really does a pretty lousy job at really delving into his evil business as very little of what he does throughout the film actually manages to make the main characters who is supposedly the Devil incarnate come off like an ordinary psychopath with a devious plan. There's a few areas here that does come off rather nicely which mostly centers on the activities of the priests to stop his plans from coming to fruition which allows this one some rather creepy supernaturallycharged action scenes. The early thwarted ambush at the TV station is rather fun with the actual kill being the highlight the assassination at the office works nicely with the surprise shock of it and the attempt on the hunting grounds is mostly memorable for turning one of the most beloved dogbreeds into vicious killers in a supposedly chilling scene only for the breed itself to make it amusingly cheesy. About the only other positive beyond these fun scenes is the rather nice way it goes about ensuring the Devilish identity of the main protagonist holding over the events of the previous film playing off the more charming and level headed characteristics that would be expected of someone like him which helps keep his identity a secret. Otherwise it's all that works here.Rated R Graphic Violence Language Brief Nudity intense themes of child death and a shadowy sex scene.".

	schema:reviewBody "The original Omen is one of the most chilling movies I have ever seen. Despite being slightly askew theologically it boasted outstanding performances from Gregory Peck Lee Remick David Warner etc. an intelligent script and above all chilling atmospherics thanks to director Richard Donner and the powerful Jerry Goldsmith score.    You really did believe that the end of the world had begun when it was all over.The first sequel Damien Omen II failed to match the original but still maintained reasonably good continuity from the first film and also had some fine performances too.    In a sense it was a lot like Jaws 2.   Not as good as the original but still okay on the whole.The Final Conflict however is a lame miserable final chapter of the trilogy and brings the terrifying events of the original to a lame and utterly weak climax that on the way is filled with some of the most gaping plot holes imaginable.    None more spectacular than adult Damien at one point saying he wants to run for the Senate in 84.   Were the producers director and writers so dense and stupid that they didn't realize that by saying that they were retroactively placing all the events of the first film in the 1950s?  Gregory Peck's lapels and David Warner's hairstyle not to mention the automobiles seemed pretty 70s to me!  What's the big deal with these events in Israel and Egypt that are being talked about frequently yet have no relevance whatsoever to the final climax?   What happened to that child that Father DeCarlo says is now safe and what does it have to do with the climax?   How was Father Spiletto the priest who saw the birth of Damien and arranged the adoption in the first film able to confess to Father DeCarlo since we saw in The Omen that he was unable to speak and could only scribble random things with his left hand?  And does the ending truly represent the return of Christ and the final judgment of humanity? Evidently not since we were served up a TV movie a decade later that I don't think I'll waste my time seeing.    Watching Sam Neill recite his Satanic prayers evoked howls of laughter from me.    A far contrast to Billie Whitelaw's nanny in the original who truly seemed like a servant of Satan.    I guess perhaps the moral of the story is that its better to depict the antiChrist as a child than as a man where the whole sense of unanticipated terror about what the future will bring when he comes to power is still there.   Indeed the terror of The Omen was in the fact that you could sense that the beginning of the end had arrived but the terror of what was still to come was still in your imagination to fear and worry about.   The Final Conflict by tackling subject matter that I think is impossible to depict or envision in a credible fashion when the gimmick has already worn out after two previous movies was in a sense doomed to fail from the outset though perhaps if there had been some actors the stature of Peck or Holden this time out the results would have been better.Stick to the first film and the second and envision your own scenario of how it all resolved itself.   You'll scare yourself a lot more that way than this film ever will.".

Had it been in the hands of a more convincing director I think it would have been better.There are moments when the film is surprisingly shocking without applying graphic effects as seen in the previous 2 films the most chilling of which are perhaps the events at the old church ruins halfway through the movie.Performances and script are very good much less cliched than Omen II and the almost lolitaesque relationship between Damien and Peter is somehow very unsettling however the original momentum is lost as the end draws near and you can't help feeling that the ending just isn't right.A superb new music score for this chapter does add to what is best described as 'disappointing'.".

	schema:headline " A Shameful Waste";
	schema:reviewBody "Recently Film4 in the UK ran all three Omen films on three consecutive nights. Having rewatched and enjoyed Omen 1 and 2 from which the combination of Jerry Goldsmiths score and creepy camera work left me pretty disturbed I was looking forward to the third and final instalment which I hadn't seen before.What a massive disappointment.This film is a complete and total waste of so many good talents.Sam Neill is pretty good as Damian Thorne. Sly authoritative when necessary and pretty twisted in certain scenes. Check out the first scene in his satanic chapel as a perfect example of how the character should be played. Excellently done.The problem here is that the basic premise of the Omen films has been thrown out of the window. I'll admit the writers here did have a challenge. They had to fulfil the prophecy elements stated in the earlier versions and somehow tie all that together with some sort of satisfying conclusion.So many story points are present but have no bearing on the rest of the plot. Damian becomes the US ambassador to the UK like his adopted father before him. This seems to have been required in the story because it's stated in the earlier films that he will rise through the world of politics. Damian also becomes the head of the UN's children's program and this point is given a fair amount of attention at the beginning of the film but once again this comes to nothing in the story.The prior two films set this story up and it's quite clear to me how the story was intended to progress. Why on earth didn't they follow this? The story as intended by Damian Omen 2 should run as follows...Damian as head of Thorn Industries has bought up huge amounts of the worlds agricultural land and holds power over food distribution creating famine wherever he pleases. It's through this that he is able to bring the world into conflict and bring about the end of days.Once again this plot point is mentioned at the beginning of the 3rd film but nothing ever comes of it. Such a frustrating waste.The staple of The Omen films is the bizarre random sometimes overly complex death scenes to those characters who threaten the antichrists ascension but once again this core element of the films is abandoned. This was the coolest signature of the films inspiring a feeling of dread in the viewer. You know they're screwed but you don't know when it's coming. The idea was taken forward by the Final Destination films with good effect. That's the fun part... and unfortunately it's missing.Instead we have Rotweilers with hypo abilities seen in the first film when the nanny hangs herself and this is massively overused. The whole thing feels like a particularly bad episode of tales of the unexpected.There is also a bizarre scene where Damian addresses his followers. The location is never disclosed and the followers appear to be a collection of Monty Python caricatures. Perhaps the most silly of these are the two boy scouts...I found myself laughing out loud at some of the supposedly terrifying death scenes especially the one at the BBC which is so silly you can't help but laugh.In my opinion this film needs to be remade to service the overall story with the ending it deserves. I want to watch each of the various strands of Damian Thorn's devilish plans slot into place perfectly as age of Satan draws closer by his design. Whether he fails or succeeds is irrelevant... We deserved a better ending than this!".

	schema:headline " Lana Clarkson II Back On The Rack";
	schema:reviewBody "Ok I'll admit it.  I'm a Lana Clarkson fan.  Her torture scene in Barbarian Queen was one of the best mainstream B movie bondage scenes ever.  Lana can moan and twitch with the best of them and make it look like fun.  Barbarian Queen II supposedly the sequel to the first film really doesn't have anything to do with the original.  None of the characters from the first film are back and Lana is the only returning actor and even her character's name has been changed.  Like the first film you can see most of it in fastforward mode on your VCR and just hit play whenever you see Lana in a dungeon.In this film Lana is a noblewoman whose evil brother usurps the crown and gains rule over the land.  Lana escapes into the woods and gains the friendship of a band of woman warriors by defeating their leader in a mud wrestling match Lana gets topless at the end of it.  They attack the castle in an attempt to restore Lana to her rightful rule.  Unfortunately the attack is defeated and Lana is captured.  Those who have seen the first film will appreciate these scenes.Lana is again bound to an upright rack though initially clothed this time.  The torturer makes a brief speech before removing her top.  Just as he is about to begin the day's activities a young girl enters the room stands in front of the rack and announces I will enjoy this part when I am queen. Lana retorts and the torturer starts his demonstration of the new rack.  This time instead of a silver hand with a needle embedded in the finger pricking Lana's body the rack itself is lowered onto a bed of sharpened spikes.  This shot would've been much better if we could've seen a fullview of Lana tied to the table.  Instead we have a profile of Lana's head and the other two actors bending over into the shot.  Obviously Lana is NOT tied to the table but is just leaning over too.  Such a waste of potential.Anyway while everyone is away at dinner Lana manages to free her hands and escape.  She's soon recaptured while trying to decide what to do with a magic sceptre apparantly the source of power and is sentenced to death by torture.  Just as this movie is Barbarian Queen II so too we get to see Lana On The Rack Twice and I'm glad we do.  I have to give Lana credit for these two movies and their torture scenes.  She really does do a good job of playing the strong defiant torture victim though I wish the second rack scene had been a bit longer with more buildup and drama.  Same with a later scene where the young girl places a spider on Lana's arm as Lana is on her back on another rack or perhaps the same rack rotated horizontally.  It would've been a better scene if Lana's character had been conscious and could squirm as the spider is placed on her arm and crawls up her shoulder. It could've made the similar James Bond scene look like amateur film.Barbarian Queen and Barbarian Queen II were made several years apart and in that time Lana Clarkson became more womanly.  Don't worry  they're real.  And they're spectacular.  I'm hoping that Lana can be convinced to do a Barbarian Queen III and give us 3 long rack scenes if she's still got the body for it.  Lana if you see this hit the gym and let's get one more film on that filmography girl.  Do it for your fans.  We're counting on you.Anyway Lana is eventually freed by a knight and they go on to defeat the evil ruler and liberate the land.  You can take her top but you can't take her FREEDOM!".

Greg Wrangler does a nice job as the conflicted love interest and best of all is the young Cecilia Twerina as the evil little Tamis. Who the heck let a kid on this picture? Who cares? she's great.The plot is simply Athalia's father the king may be dead and the evil Ankaris wants the throne but needs the magical scepter to hold it. For some reason never really explained Hofrax Cudney is helping him. Tamis is Ankaris's wicked daughter. OK the budget is obviously low but the film doesn't look that bad and the performers appear to be trying. Note the convenient barrel of water that spills off the back of the wagon so Althalia and a barbarian babe can mud wrestle!! the fights aren't too badly staged and the plotting is pretty decent.

The plot is stale and formulaic the acting stiff but there's still that charm of scantily clad amazon warriors led by their rather randy queen in a revolution against the Great Evil which is in power. This is from the eras before Hollywood became so concerned with accusations of smut mongering the films of the last decade or so have been lacking the delightful skin scenes which used to be a standard component of such films. If this film were being made today the amazons would be covered much more thoroughly and Ms. Clarkson would not share her bountiful charms with us. If it sounds like I miss those days I do. Many a mediocre film was made worthwhile by a liberal splashing of young nubile skin.

Pretty much the same stuff with less often less intense bondage etc. but a nice mudwrestling scene near the beginning.  In movies like this when I think some of the acting is pretty bad this does not include Lana I guess I have to be understanding in realizing they have programmed wooden lines and delivery so...

The whole film is a lineup of crappy battle sequences hilariously stupid dialogue bared breasts and unintentional? hilarity. The late Lana Clarkson once again plays the sexy eponymous heroine Barbarian Queen Princess Athalia. Actually I don't really see why the people in this flick are referred to as 'Barabarians' since it clearly takes place some time in the middle ages although the first part took place in times of the Roman Empire. Both movies of course are actually set in some indefinable fantasy time but while the first film equally mixed up medieval and more ancient elements everything looks predominantly medieval here well except for the Amazon warrior chicks in buckskin mini skirts and tank tops. The battle sequences are extremely crappy and so is the entire choreography. During fights it always looks as if the 'actors' are going to drop their weapons anytime since they act so amateurish. The performances are plain awful and the dialogue is even worse in a hilarious way though not to mention that all the medieval 'Barbarians' talk in American English. Even though this film is about as awful as it can get you can't really get bored. One hilariously awful fight literally hunts the other and each time this seems to become monotonous Lana Clarkson bares her breasts for a change. Both the Barbarian Queen films are hilarious examples for movies that are 'so bad they're good'. This Barbarian Queen 2 must be one of the silliest and most amateurish films ever brought to screen but it sure is great fun to watch!".

	schema:reviewBody "Not too sure what the title means here there was no Empress in the first film and the plot doesn't relate in any way to the first film either. Characters are also different to the original film despite starring Lana Clarkson in both.What we have here is a slight play on Robin Hood. A king is killed in battle so his unruly son claims the throne for himself including the magical scepter which is the source of the kingdoms power. The kings daughter Clarkson protests this naturally and is marked for execution to get rid of her...naturally. She escapes joins up with some other female rebel warriors just like that and they all band together to win the kingdom back hurrah! Now I hope your not expecting too much here you know what this will entail much like the previous film and all the 'Deathstalker' films. Plenty of tits and ass skimpy outfits females killing poorly skilled swordsmen Clarkson on the rack again topless and errr more poorly skilled baddie swordsmen trying to rape big breasted women happens a lot in these films.Pretty much exactly the same as the first film there's a good rescue scene from the gallows which is similar to the sequence in 'The Adventures of Robin Hood' with Errol Flynn. There is a nice sadistic little girl Princess who is heir to the throne if Clarkson's character is gotten rid of the whole point of the film whom I liked her spoilt bratty ways are fun to watch as all around her cower in fear. Just like the first film the finale is way better than the rest with a semi decent sword battle within the castle. Costumes are quite nice in this film it must be said a kind of Crusades thing going on with the good guys whilst the sets look suspiciously like sets used before oh well. The lead male hero in this looks the part too he actually looks like he could be in a proper film the same can't be said about the clichd blonde lead Clarkson. Well by now you will know if you like these films or not a guilty pleasure possibly just for a laugh and some naked girlies perhaps. Not as good as 'Deathstalker' though.310".

	schema:headline " If you quite like the idea of halfnaked barbarian warrior girls then this might be the film for you";
	schema:reviewBody "Barbarian Queen is one of the cycle of sword and sandal flicks that were popular in the mid 80's. Back then the formula seemed to incorporate lots of sword fights and lots of semi naked girls. This flick certainly adheres to this principle that's for sure especially the bit about the naked girls. In fact I guess if you were inclined towards political correctness you could label Barbarian Queen as a film that is a little bit sexist. But I myself am quite partial to salacious genre movies and I lapped this one up quite a bit. The story really isn't too important but suffice to say it features a group of Amazonian type women on a quest to get vengeance on a tribe of incredibly misogynistic men who opened up the movie by raping and murdering their people.There's lots of sex and violence in this one. And for what it's worth the breast count appeared to be astronomical as well. It's certainly a movie that delivers on its promise and that is certainly not a bad thing. Lana Clarkson plays the titular heroine with some gusto. She's pretty good in the action scenes as well as the nude ones. Of the latter there is a somewhat erotic scene where she is tied up in a torture chamber. Somewhat notably she escapes from this seemingly doomed situation by defeating her jailer by way of a rather extreme application of the Cleopatra Grip I'll let you look that one up!. You have to give a film marks for originality for the likes of this that's for sure.Barbarian Queen has a story and action that is bythenumbers really but it gains points for gratuitous excess. They don't really seem to make them like this anymore and that is a bit of a shame.".

Rather this movie is one that can be seen in fastforward mode on your VCR and you won't miss a bit of the plot which I'll give in a bit.  The impression it made on me was one of Lana Clarkson who plays the lead role topless and tied to an upright rack while she's tortured with a needle by a smallish man with large glasses.Now the reason she's there  Amathea Lana Clarkson was about to be married to the prince of her village when soldiers charge in and slaughter just about everyone.  The prince is captured and Amathea escapes into the woods where she joins up with 3 other warriors.  They plan to go to the city and rescue the prince.  Along the way they manage to kill a few straggling soldiers rescue a woman tied to fence who's topless and has been whipped and make friends with rebels seeking to overthrow the local ruler. Amathea's sister allows herself to be captured by the ruler so that she can be his concubine and Amathea is captured while trying to rescue her.  The king thinks Amathea is part of the rebel movement and orders her to be tortured until she identifies the rebel leaders. After the 5 minute torture scene Amathea throws the torturer into a vat of acid and escapes freeing the gladiators and the prince and creating a mediocre fight scene wherein the ruler is overthrown and the people are free.Don't see this movie for the plot.  Don't see it for the dialogue.  You'll want to see it because the 4 main actresses in the film eventually have nude scenes in this order rape nipple play wrestling woman on the fence topless rape stripped topless Lana's torture scene.  The rape scenes are weak the wrestling is short.  I'm convinced that the only reason they made a sequel was to show Lana Clarkson on a rack again see Barbarian Queen II. Unless you're into bad barbarian swordandsandle movies mild rape Lana Clarkson andor bondage you can skip this movie. Me I saw it for Lana Clarkson.".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched Barbarian Queen after seeing several movies made by Argentina filmmakers at the United States Film Festival a.k.a Sundance back in the 80s. A large chunk of these films were about the justended military Junta that took place in that country. Thousand went missing dead or were tortured during those very black days. One of the films  Night of the Pencils was made by the very same director Hector Olivera of Barbarian Queen. Pencils is a serious film that examines the brutalization of several young folk during the Junta years. When I came across Barbarian Queen I was some what surprised that this obvious exploitation sword and sorcery was made by the same guy. However some of very antiJunta sentiments are buried in this rather mercenary Conan ripoff. Barbarian Queen is about a group of villagers taken captive by an evil regime. It also features a sinister and very creepy torture doctor. These are very familiar to the victims of the military Junta. And while the film does wallow in the same rape fantasy that populated a big chunk of these sword  sorcery bmovies there is one sequence I think that more honestly displays Olivera's view. In that scene Clarkson comes across a young women that is chained to a pole. She is bruised beaten and scarred not in the least bit sexy. A hideously brutish soldier stands before her. He takes her bruised face in his hands and orders the captive to smile. Clarkson rams a sword through his neck. This lit bit of business is not in the least bit titillating. The last thing we want is for the loathsome soldier to have his way with this broken woman. It is very satisfying when he gets his at the business end of Clarkson's sword. It is quite a powerful scene probably the best in the movie. I am not foolish enough to look at this sleazy bit of exploitation shot on the cheap by Corman and crew as some sort of political statement. Still it is kind of interesting to see the impact the Junta made on Olivera creep perhaps unconsciously into this Corman quickie. I never would have made the connection at all if I hadn't just seen a bunch of Argentinean movies before this. It certainly makes Barbarian Queen more interesting for me than it probably deserves.".

Most of these cheaply produced and trashy Sword  Sorcery or should I say Boobs  Sorcery flicks are awful as hell but they're hilarious unintentional comedies and Barbarian Queen is the epitome of such a hilarious semi? unintentional comedy.

It's often stated that this is set in the times of the Roman empire but the villains really have nothing Roman about them I'd say the movie is set in a typical undefinable Sword'n'Sorcery fantasy time some of the folks look like medieval knights others like Barbarians from more ancient times...The whole movie is quite similar to an earlier Lana Clarkson movie Deathstalker of 1983 In which she played a role that was almost the same as in this one. I personally enjoyed Deathstaker more since it was gorier and the unintentional comedy factor was at times even higher but Barbarian Queen is definitely also recommended if you're looking for a good laugh. The acting is unsurprisingly godawful and the settings sometimes make you wonder if the hilarious flaws are really unintentional. Apart from its value as an unintentional comedy Barbarian Queen delivers a good amount of sleaze and a busty female cast that gets topless every five minutes.Barbarian Queen may be a godawful film but people with a sense of humor should have a good time watching it and laughing their asses off.".

Amethea teams up with her friend Estrild played by future director Katt Shea and the innocent Taramis Dawn Dunlap to take on the depraved bad guys assisted by an underground rebel movement.One has to give these filmmakers credit as they know exactly what kind of movie they're making. The first shot of a womans' breasts occurs no more and no less than 37 seconds into the story as two creeps aim to have their way with Taramis. Although there's not a great deal of actual story here Barbarian Queen moves along fairly well and clocks in at an acceptable 72 minute run time. Things never get particularly gory with doses of the red stuff being somewhat limited. The attractive cast all look very nice in their assorted skimpy costumes. The aforementioned score is pleasing even if the compositions from Horner are lifted  in typical Roger Corman fashion  from the earlier Battle Beyond the Stars.Clarkson is an appealing heroine and Shea does well as her equally strong friend. The studly Frank Zagarino is a decent hero. Armando Capo snarls adequately as our thoroughly evil antagonist Arrakur. Tony Middleton is fun to watch as the torturer Zohar in a sequence that's sure to delight viewers.Filmed on location in Argentina this can boast some respectable production value.Six out of 10.".

As a fan of these types of movies the sword and sandal genre I have seen quite a few. Even in the most cheaply produced ones I can point to at least something I liked in the movie.However with Barbarian Queen there is not a single good scene or even one bit of dialogue that distinguishes the film. An hour into the film it still has not advanced beyond the warrior women being pursued by lusty meninterspaced with swordfight scenes.One of the most annoying things in the movie is the unconvincing nature of the lead actresses. Basically they are Playboy Playmates pretending to be Amazons. They can hardly lift a sword and deliver unconvincing and wobbly strokes against men who are twice their size.The music contains excerpts from other Corman films like Battle Beyond the Stars and Deathstalker. The costumes of the evil guards and soldiers such as the headware are lifted also from the latter film.Of course with a Cormanproduced film you aren't expecting Ingmar Bergmanlike quality. But even a low budget swordfest like Deathstalker was much more enjoyable than this. Zero effort seems to have been put into making even a passable script.This movie is sure to put you to sleep.".

Even in the most cheaply produced ones I can point to at least something I liked in the movie.However with Barbarian Queen there is not a single good scene or even one bit of dialogue that distinguishes the film. An hour into the film it still has not advanced beyond the warrior women being pursued by lusty meninterspaced with swordfight scenes.One of the most annoying things in the movie is the unconvincing nature of the lead actresses. Basically they are Playboy Playmates pretending to be Amazons. They can hardly lift a sword and deliver unconvincing and wobbly strokes against men who are twice their size.The music contains excerpts from other Corman films like Battle Beyond the Stars and Deathstalker. The costumes of the evil guards and soldiers such as the headware are lifted also from the latter film.Of course with a Cormanproduced film you aren't expecting Ingmar Bergmanlike quality. But even a low budget swordfest like Deathstalker was much more enjoyable than this. Zero effort seems to have been put into making even a passable script.This movie is sure to put you to sleep.";

This film in question Barbarian Queen is my least favorite of the four films and the one out of the four that does not have any fantasy elements. To be fair it is more of an ancient world action picture and a true endurance test for me to get through beginning to end without falling asleep. Former Playboy model Lana Clarkson does look good here and so does the rest of the female cast. While this film does deliver the goods for maximum boobage it is pretty much all it has going for it. Our story is set in Roman times but the film does little to make it period correct or Roman. Lana Clarkson and friends unite to fight the evil empire but mostly must avoid rapeand attempted rape by fighting real stupid and horny men. Do not get me wrong the Deathstalker films are totally ridiculous as well but they pull off being entertaining where Barbarian Queen fails miserably at. Lana Clarkson appears in the first Deathstalker film to boot and has less screen time but is much more memorable than she is here. I have no problem with women kicking ass but this film is poor and I would have found my time better spent rewatching Red Sonja or episodes of Xena Warrior Princess.".

Again you must check out the poster for this film so so very sexy and awesome yet as usual nothing like the actual movie such a shame.Set in the Roman era apparently never noticed myself the plot revolves around a small band of female warriors and their Queen trying to save the Queens sister from nasty Romans. Nothing really happens for the entire film to be brutally honest and its really rather dull.Of course there are the obligatory topless scenes for many female characters and some soft porn sexy moments which will keep any hot blooded male interested but not for long. The finale is pretty good with a semi decent fight sequence within a semi decent set. All the sword fighting is pretty hokey looking but its fun to watch all the extras pretend to be proper swordsmenwomen.End of the day I watched this because of the cool film title. Yep I'm a perv but for what other reason would any male watch this? certainly not for the epic historic story line or quality acting oh no. Its Corman and its all about big breasted blonde women in skimpy outfits with swords killing men expect nothing less.210".

	schema:reviewBody "Umberto Bossi leader of the Northern League Lega Nord and minister in Berlusconi's coalition Government has a bit part in this film I failed to spot him. The film was sponsored by the Italian Cultural Ministry. Nothing wrong with taxpayers' money subsidising cultural projects beyond the reach of commercial reward. I applaud how French local government sponsors recordings of obscure but delectable baroque operas. Unfortunately 'Barbarossa' is more soap opera than great cultural project. This is a pity because it tells an important story. The film works best when it concentrates on the known history. Rutger Hauer makes a very good Barbarossa  the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick 1st who oversaw the canonisation of his predecessor Charlemagne as part of his bid to recreate a Universal Empire. This warrior king is supported by his feisty second wife Beatrice who bore him 12 children and his cousin Henry the Lion who finally abandons him before his famous defeat at Legnano. There is some attention to historical detail  his standard Charlemagne's crown the outbreak of plague in Rome the destruction of Milan Henry's refusal to help before Legnano.Opposing Barbarossa's imperial ambitions we have the film's hero one Alberto da Giussano a mythical figure in the mould of Robin Hood and William Tell. Alberto is also an icon of the Lega Nord. He inspires the Lombard League of rival Northern cities to unite against Barbarossa with such cunning devices as  an unbreakable bundle of sticks!! The writers weave an unconvincing story around Alberto. There is a distracting romance with a 'seerwitch' whose sister is pursued by archvillain and imperialsupporting Milanese 'traitor' F. Murray Abraham. The subplot of what happens to these fictitious characters does nothing for the film at all. It simply dumbs down and spoils the film's central theme pace and dynamic. Alberto is onedimensional and has little to recommend him. There is much plain silliness clich and banality.There is nothing intrinsically wrong in mixing fact and fiction in a feature film. Interweaving the lives of the mythical Alberto and the real Barbarossa is a useful device which personalises the political struggle. It is a pity that the quality of the very good opening scene is not sustained. The film degenerates into a flabby unfocused meander through some 20 years of history. Hildegard of Bingen prophesying Barbarossa's watery death is an unnecessary distraction which has nothing to do with the film's theme. It should be possible to make a much better 'pro Lombardy' film than this one. Frederick bearing off the Magi Relics from Milan Cathedral to Germany where they still reside added insult to injury after he destroyed Milan. But this is omitted. Script and direction needed to be much tighter.The battle scenes are mediocre when compared with recent medieval films. The portrayal of the climactic Battle of Legnano is inaccurate. A central role is assigned to scythewielding peasants in carts who wreak destruction among the imperial cavalry. The one Carroccio cart bearing the standard and crucifix of the rebels has been multiplied and transformed into a division of 12th Century tanks! This is a laughable end to a disappointing film. The battle was in fact decided by the late arrival of the Brescian cavalry. Why these North Italian cities opposed Frederick is never clearly explained. We witness some taxavoiding swordsmiths butcher imperial officers who catch them smuggling. A written demand from Frederick to Milan is ground underfoot with no explanation. Alberto and friends spend a lot of time crying 'Freedom!' Rivalries between and within cities are alluded to but the F. Murray Abraham character is left to shoulder the burden of the proimperial cause. This is shown simply as cowardly and selfserving.All history is partial and I have no quarrel with an Italian film singing the virtues of the Lombard League. North Italian cities have made a great contribution to Western Civilisation. They were but one player in the forces arrayed against Barbarossa. These included Pope Alexander III the Norman king of Sicily and innumerable German princes who had already drained power and wealth from the office of emperor which was fast becoming elective. None of these appear as protagonists in this film. This complex political struggle lasted centuries and sowed the seeds of future German and Italian disunity. In this respect at least the film renders good service in highlighting an important piece of history. This longlasting disunity eventually produced two manic nationalisms wars of unification and unstable modern unities which quickly degenerated into the FascismNazism whose shadow still hangs over us. So the obscure story told here is an important component of European history which raises the perennial issue of Centralism versus Localism.Bossi and his Lega Nord wish to rally rich Northerners against corrupt Romans and Mafiaridden Southerners. They would no doubt like to remind us that Barbarossa was able to establish a tight control over Central Italy and a marriage alliance with the Norman South. It seems that only sturdy Northerners can be trusted to maintain freedom from corruption indolence and outside interference! Having defeated the great Barbarossa the Lombard League's modern descendants must unite to prevent their hardearned cash being syphoned off to an unworthy South. So the film's message serves modern identity politics. Nothing wrong with that. All politics is identity politics. Another historical interpretation would argue that Barbarossa ceded very little to the cities after his Legnano defeat that his 40year struggle to build a power base in Germany Burgundy and Italy left him feeling secure and wealthy enough to embark on the fatal Third Crusade. The premature deaths of Frederick and his son conspired to prevent Germany from developing into a united hereditary monarchy with all the consequences this entailed. The relations between the North Italian cities and their subsequent rulers remained tense because cities produce great wealth which rulers want to get their hands on. Clearly these tensions remain!".

So I watched this as a very entertaining view into a sadly forgotten part of history this fight over the lands how they had become when the Roman Empire was crumbling leaving a massive power vacuum and the German tribes had begun to finally become united.The film depicted this fight over the desolated areas in northern Italy as far as I can tell very well showing both the reasoning of Emperor Barbarossa and his queen Beatrix who appears to have been his personal cheerleader and the opposing side the Company of Death a loosely formed army from the Italian city states. This opposing side bears a strong resemblance to both the historical American Revolution from which it seemed like they loaned half of the freedom slogans as well as from Braveheart which probably provided the other half. Don't get me wrong I like freedom but one can only do so much with it and the cries for freedom became a little silly at times  especially since it appeared to me that they only went to war because they didn't like to be taxed by a German emperor...Speaking of which The film is called Barbarossa but most of the film and the very evident sympathies lies with Barbarossa's enemies. This is not a biography film but it would have earned even better marks if it would have been.So how was it then? It was grand in scope ranging in at several years and the SFX  especially the 'Bagdhad by Night  medieval style' sequences were great. However using such large time frames makes one loose sight on events and details which is a shame.Rutger Hauer makes an excellent if somewhat downplayed Barbarossa and the rest of the cast make solid performances  no one mentioned no one forgotten.It will take a couple of hours to sit thorough this film but those are hours well spent.".

This opposing side bears a strong resemblance to both the historical American Revolution from which it seemed like they loaned half of the freedom slogans as well as from Braveheart which probably provided the other half. Don't get me wrong I like freedom but one can only do so much with it and the cries for freedom became a little silly at times  especially since it appeared to me that they only went to war because they didn't like to be taxed by a German emperor...Speaking of which The film is called Barbarossa but most of the film and the very evident sympathies lies with Barbarossa's enemies. This is not a biography film but it would have earned even better marks if it would have been.So how was it then? It was grand in scope ranging in at several years and the SFX  especially the 'Bagdhad by Night  medieval style' sequences were great. However using such large time frames makes one loose sight on events and details which is a shame.Rutger Hauer makes an excellent if somewhat downplayed Barbarossa and the rest of the cast make solid performances  no one mentioned no one forgotten.It will take a couple of hours to sit thorough this film but those are hours well spent.";

	schema:reviewBody "The producer should be shot for calling his film Barbarossa since it's definitely not a biopic of the Frederick I Hohenstaufen. It's rather like titling Braveheart Longshanks since Barbarossa's relationship to the action of this film is precisely that of Edward I' in Mel Gibson's classic. These two films share much in common which should come as no surprise given the zeitgeist across Europe at the timetoo many men who would be king too little land left to conquer and peoples unwilling to be conquered.This film would probably have been quite good had the producer either scrapped dubbing some of the worst in the history of that precarious art altogether or at least coughed up another million for firstclass dubbing. That mistake probably cost him dearly as did releasing a film about medieval Italian patriots to an Italian audience in English. The boxoffice take in Italy tragically proves this point. And while international casting often enriches our enjoyment of a film I think it might have hurt in this one but once again dubbing makes such a judgment impossible however it's no surprise F. Murray Abraham gets such praise for his performanceyes he's good but he's also a nativeborn speaker of English so we Anglophones don't miss a word he says.Because Barbarossa is so difficult to comprehend there's not much that can be said about it. Perhaps there's a great film beneath the layers of excruciating dubbing. I wanted to love it I did not want to feel that I'd just wasted my freedom enslaved to Barbarossa's mindnumbing dubbing.The nonverbal acting was fine the camera work was excellent the art direction set design and costuming 'felt' authentic and there is much to be praised for the work with horses. Alberto da Giussano deserves a better film however and Hildegard von Bingen who was far greater mind than either Barbarossa or da Giussano deserved better treatment. That great polymath and visionary was no swooning saintit's hard to produce so much music literature and scientific writing whilst in a faint.I've read the name of the film's been changed to Swords of Fighting or some such rot. But unless Barbarossa' been redubbed it will stink just as much. If you want to learn more about Alberto da Giussano see this film. Or better yet visit a library!Where is that Spanish Inquisition when you need it?".

If you love history as much as I do don't watch this movie as it is really really bad couldn't believe this movies rating is above 4! too high for this movie.The only decent actor is Rutger Hauer and I have no idea why he agreed to do this movie must have been a promise to a friend or a lot of money. All other actors especially the protagonist are really painful to watch.Besides that apart from being based on a historical event it is very inaccurate some people stated this before. That doesn't have to be bad as long as the entertaining value is there look at Braveheart  Kingdom of Heaven for examples those movies are highly inaccurate but very entertaining.This movie is also the perfect example that love stories are more a burden on a movie than added value. It was not convincing at all and sounded too forced. If this is what Italy has to offer then please stop making movies!".

All other actors especially the protagonist are really painful to watch.Besides that apart from being based on a historical event it is very inaccurate some people stated this before. That doesn't have to be bad as long as the entertaining value is there look at Braveheart  Kingdom of Heaven for examples those movies are highly inaccurate but very entertaining.This movie is also the perfect example that love stories are more a burden on a movie than added value. It was not convincing at all and sounded too forced. If this is what Italy has to offer then please stop making movies!";

Apart from an instance where a horse made a sound I considered unlikely under the circumstances based on my experience with them my beef is that this movie is so much less than what it could have been. It could have been an epic but they missed the bar. It could also have made a good patriotic film such as the Russian film 1612 had they shifted the focus a little more on the Milanese and slightly less on Barbarossa filmed it in Italian It is an Italian film after all. and livened it up a tad.Bottom line if you're a fan of this sort of movie as I am watch it. It isn't that great but I do not regret the time spent watching it. It just could have been better. If on the other hand you feel no attraction to films of this type and are merely looking for a good movie to burn some time on you might want to look elsewhere. Not to scare you off though. Who knows you might enjoy it.If you like this movie try 1612. That is the movie I was most reminded of watching this one.".

Ice Cube Cedric the Entertainer and the rest of the guys at the downtown Chicago barbershop return for another round but the usual sense of community and their outrageous discussions is threatened by urban developers who hope to replace the small barbershops with big national chains. Like its predecessor Barbershop 2 is pretty much plot less as the characters are what people want to see. I thought the first one was decent but nothing special and that's exactly what I think of this one. Ice Cube Eve Sean Patrick Thomas Troy Garity and Michael Ealy are all back and they are enjoyable this time around as well. The one person I couldn't stand was Cedric the Entertainer he had some funny lines but most of the time he was really annoying also those flashback scenes he was in were really stupid. There's a couple of new additions including Queen Latifah. I thought she was very funny and I might check out Beauty Shop sometime in the future. The other addition is Kenan Thompson he isn't very interesting in the film but also doesn't have a lot of scenes so that's nice. Kevin Rodney Sullivan directs this time around and he does a good job replacing Tim Story who was apparently busy with Taxi and The Fantastic Four. Absent from the sequel is Anthony Anderson who isn't missed in fact you probably won't notice. The film talks about a lot of different things like R Kelly The Washington Sniper and others you may not agree with what their saying all the time though. The sequel is a bit more warm hearted this time around but the dialog is still sharp and funny. Rating 610 In the end if you liked the first one then you will probably like this one but if you didn't then its best if you avoid the sequel.".

Seeing the trailer for this months ago it just didn't seem to have the same spark the original had.  After watching this last night that feeling hasn't really changed.  I enjoyed Barbershop 2 but it's miles behind the original especially in the comedy area.  The original was a 'cute' movie it tapped into everyone's childhood neighborhood memories of the local barbershop that was a mainstay in the community....all while having a nice story behind it Ice Cube not seeing the importance of the shop and threatening to sell it.  The sequel just seems to go with the motions you can tell that its trying its best not to rock the boat particularly with the jokes.  The story in BS2 is arguably more relevant than the one in the original  a bigger more attractive industrialized barbershop chain comes into the neighborhood threatening the 'mom  pop' stores on the block who have to fight to survive.  As far as comedy the movie on a whole isn't as funny as the original as it takes a more serious tone.  Its obvious that the makers tried their very best not to step on anyone's toes or if they did not step on them too hard.  The success and exposure of the original in this case worked against them as I felt the makers held back a little too much as far as the comedy goes. Nevertheless I enjoyed Barbershop 2 but I just hope the franchise doesn't get too bland with the seemingly inevitable spinoff coming Beauty Shop.  out of  stars.".

Barbershop owner Ice Cube and his fellow cutters outofplace female Eve African immigrant Leonard Earl Howze super white boy Troy Garity excon Michael Ealy and loudmouthed veteran Cedric the Entertainer have a new problem on their hands. Business opportunist Harry Lennix wants to open a Nappy Cutz a fictional Super Cutsstyled ripoff shop across the street. Immediately the group is worried about the possibility of being run out of business by the upstarts. Former barber Sean Patrick Thomas now working for Illinois state governor Robert Wisdom realizes the situation and does what he can to help. Naturally though Wisdom is just as crooked and suspicious as Lennix so thus another dilemma occurs. Ice Cube is also constantly bothered by one of his wife's Jazsmin Lewis relatives a priceless turn by Kenan Thompson. Thompson also has the itch to become a stylist and hangs around the shop in spite of the fact that no one trusts him with their hair. Also along for the ride is beauty shop owner Queen Latifah who doubles as Cube's old love interest and Cedric's acidtongued equal. A little history into Cedric's background is hilarious heartbreaking and thoughtprovoking all at the same time. He thinks about a lost love Garcelle Beauvais and also remembers Cube's kind and decent father Javon Jackson. Flashbacks to a Civil Rightstorn landscape of 1960s Chicago becomes a strangely poignant part of a franchise that people do not think of as serious. All in all Barbershop 2 Back in Business is a noble work. Once again the screenplay and direction are adequate but the amazing characters are still the series' primary calling card. Lennix and Wisdom are really not quite as good as antagonist Keith David was in the original. I also missed neighborhood troublemakers Anthony Anderson and Lahmard Tate but their absences do not shatter the overall effectiveness of the sequel. 4 stars out of 5.".

The sequel is a lot more in depth with its characters and we learn a little more about each one and how they have improved since the first film.  If Back in Business has any flaws it's that there is not enough action inside the barbershop where most of the action took place in the first film.  There is a little more drama with Back in Business that never slows the film down a little drama never hurt anyone did it?  Either way I did thoroughly enjoy myself watching Barbershop 2 Back in Business and I rated it a 910.".

	schema:reviewBody "Barbershop 2 Back in Business 2004 Dir Kevin Rodney Sullivan  Cast Ice Cube Cedric the Entertainer Sean Patrick Thomas Queen Latifah Eve Here is a comedy that not just continues the story of the hit film but it also addresses being yourself and making others comfortable with your world. It opens with a 1967 flashback centering upon Cedric the Entertainer escaping the law and finding refuge in a barbershop that he would remain at for the next forty years. Business is going well until a bigger corporation begins buying up businesses on the block and establish a rival barbershop. Structured in sitcom fashion with a clever conclusion. Director Kevin Rodney Sullivan gives a realistic view of the barber scene. Ice Cube is excellent as the second generation manager who struggles against the decline in business in the area as well as competition. Cedric the Entertainer is given a back story involving romance on a subway. Fine supporting work by Sean Patrick Thomas who left the barbershop and took up politics which come into conflict with his old friends. Queen Latifah plays Cube's exgirlfriend who remains friends and opened a beauty salon next door. She and Cedric do not get along. Eve also makes an appearance from the music industry. While much of this is predictable it is still a worthwhile and entertaining sequel deserving of business. Score 8  10".

This time around though it's not just some loan shark threatening him. In addition to Leroux he's facing opposition from a crooked politician alderman Brown Robert Wisdom who's taking payoffs from Leroux. Faced with what appears to be an unbeatable pair alongside a new business filled with flash and pizzazz Calvin tries to compete by sprucing up his place and hosting a cookout for the neighborhood complete with free cuts for the kids. The odds are stacked against him though. At a vote before the local board determining whether or not to allow construction in the neighborhood to go forward Calvin steps up to speak. Leroux has made him an offer of more money than he's ever seen before. Will he choose to take the money and advise the other business's around him to do the same? Or will he stand up for what's right?While all of this sounds serious and it is the movie is fueled by the humor that is wrapped around this story. All of the characters from the previous film are back on board and their lives have changed in different but positive ways. In particular this time we get to know more about Eddie Cedric the Entertainer his back story and a romance we never knew about.

	schema:reviewBody "2002's Barbershop didn't necessarily reinvent the wheel of comedy but it's something quite unique. Hearkening back to Ice Cube's 1995 hit Friday the film tries to make use of the non story. Instead thriving on its characters and slow plot exposition.In Barbershop 2 they try to duplicate the first one but doesn't quite work as wellalbeit almost. Whereas the writers in the first Barbershop seem to be on their own level making their own rules Barbershop 2 seems to channel a little too much Tyler Perry. It's a slightly more predictable and silly and transparent and tries to please the audience too much. An exception is the return of Cedric the Entertainer as the old man barber Eddie who never cuts hair but will tell you every last thing that's on his mind. He's still got the edgy dialogue that would make today's PC crowd shiver in their organic Uggs.In Barbershop 2 Calvin Ice Cube learns of a Supercutsesque barbershop opening up across the street. The word around town is buzzing because this place is supposed to be like the country club of barbershops. Eventually he finds out that the whole community is getting a facelift which forces out all of the businesses who have worked hard establishing themselves as mainstays for the neighborhood.The pacing is about the same but feels much slowermostly due to the reduction of sub stories and Bplots. There are so many different characters but each one's significance is lessened in order to better focus on the premise.Both films are about integrity and doing the right thing but this one just says it a bit differently.It's funny because as the film tries so hard to be deeper the characters become less so. They're all just as likable but the dynamics just aren't as strong.As a stand alone film Barbershop 2 isn't bad at all. In fact it's quite enjoyable. The jokes won't really leave you rolling in the aisles but there is plenty of smileworthy dialogue. The content means well and provides us with the similar warmth that the first one gives us. A little less cool Barbershop 2 can pride itself on at least giving us another taste of what made the first one so special without tarnishing anything.Twizard Rating 74".

Cedric the Entertainer is indeed pretty entertaining here. Sean Patrick Thomas is an underrated actor although this role was far from his best. Michael Ealy is almost certainly the best actor in the bunch. Kenan Thompson...well...he's okay. And Queen Latifah is very appealing on the big screen.Don't worry you're not going to have to wade in too deep here but there is a decent story about character. And surrounding the serious story are lots of belly laughs...and not just Cedric's belly. Well worth a watch even though it probably won't end up on your DVD shelf.".

So it's a disappointment....but a minor one.At the end of Barbershop the shop's owner Ice Cube is able to keep the shop from being bought out and its future seems secure. Well now only a short time later the future of this independent shop is once again in doubt as a haircut chain store is moving right across the street. The new shop has everythingglitz a basketball court inside the store an aquarium and style. So it looks like the quaint old place is about ready to go belly up as soon as the new place opens for business. In addition to this plot the old characters are back and have changed in a variety of waysmostly for the better.One big difference between this and the first film is the presence of many flashback scenes featuring Cederic the Entertainer's character back in the late 1960s. While these flashbacks are all very interesting since the times were so explosive I really wish they'd put this in a separate movie as they seemed more like filler and distracted from the rest of the film. So either remove these segments OR stretch them into a film in their own right. As it was it felt awkward.Overall while the film wasn't quite the original in quality and originality it was entertaining. Plus as I liked the old film so much it was like visiting with old friends here in Barbershop 2.".

Sure the plot is just about the same as the first but the movie still entertains and the cast is even better since we have a few new characters such as Queen Latifah who plays Gina the owner of another barbershop near Calvin's. Ice Cube returns as Calvin Palmer the owner of a very popular barbershop on the Chicago Southside. The entire cast does return and offers something a little new to the film surely Eddie Cedric the Entertainer for in this film he rambles about the Kobe Bryant trial R. Kelly and Michael Jackson as well as a few others. Eve returns as Teri Sean Patrick Thomas Michael Ealy Troy Garity and more. I should also point out that this installment is directed by a different director Kevin Rodney Sullivan who made his debut with this film and he keeps the franchise going more than well. Barbershop 2 Back In Business is rated PG13 for Language Sexual Material and Brief Drug References. The language is a bit bawdy and rough there's also sexual innuendo nothing explicit though. The film has already been a hit and surely deserves to be one I'm not too sure if it's better than the first but it sure is as good. Head down to the theatre and check out Barbershop 2.".

The promoters were pleased I'm sure that one of the many names on the venue actually appeared and entertained! Cedric is a real LADIES man. He is always smiling and the attention is received with positive feedback. He was the life of the not so organized event. He could have walked but he knew there was much disappointment in the air with all the noshow names on the venue at Kartuche night club in Jacksonville. Some like me paid 175.00 for VIP passes that were entry to An upstairs room filled with herbal essence in the air! An area Cedric and Pimpen Ken did not enter! Cedric saved the show by taking over and handled it like the PRO Entertainer that he is. Despite the no show names of various artists and players scheduled to appear. The man has it going on. It's no wonder he is so loved. The life he leads is that of a respectful man who cares about all of his fans! He is a top notch fun guy to KICKIT with. I had my digital camcorder and got a lot of good footage of the camera friendly ENTERTAINER My kids are really excited about all the great stuff I got on camera. We will cherish the recorded footage of a real down to earth CEDRIC THE LADIES MAN ENTERTAINER! All his movies are GREAT and will be watched for many years to come by his adoring fans! Barber Shop is my favorite I think THANKS CEDDIE! Jodi ChambersWilson Jax Bch. Florida".

	schema:headline " A 'black' film with a soul. It can be done";
	schema:reviewBody "When I first saw the plot and cast for this movie I was filled with little hope that this film would be any more than a stereotypical look at blackurban culture with the characters rhyming words for supposed comic effect ad the scriptwriter fitting a screenplay around the jokes. It us easy to forget that the film's protagonist Ice Cube who gave a fine performance had just come off making the awful 'All About the Benjamins' which fell into the trap of so many of these comedies based around black people. Added to the fact that 'Barbershop' was released when there had been a spate of these substandard pictures such as 'How High' Friday After Next' and 'State Property' you can understand why I approached this movie with no expectations.Thankfully I was proved wrong as 'Barbershop' followed a simple structure to work. It had solid direction a commendable screenplay was well acted but more important than any of that it was a story worth telling and that is the one thing that good films have in common. However this does not mean that this movie followed the conventional ways of Hollywood and 'sold out' to appeal to a mass audience. If anything pleased me most about the film it was the fact that it retained a true sense of representing the black community and credit for this goes to the high standards of dialogue and acting. People who live in the suburbs can watch in the knowledge that they're getting a window into another culture while people in urban communities can watch this with a comforting sense of familiarity. Another reason for this is that the screenplay is informed enough to not 'pigeon hole'. The characters are well rounded with both positive and negative traits and the movie is not surrounded by gunssingle mothers and drugs. This is not not to say these issues are ignored as they are connected with one the film's major plot strands but despite the mass media sterotype to which not all black people are unaccountable the 'ghettos' of America are primarily filled with honest hardworking people who just trying to make the best of an unenviable situation. While previous urban films have made a point of blaming 'whitey' and 'the man' for the troubling issues surrounding black people 'Barbershop' looks closer to home and encourages black people to take responsibility for themselves and to break away from nature of 'frontin' that is slowly paralysing urban communities. One of the films best quotes is 'Dont buy yourself a Benz when your living with your mama! And black people please can we be on time for something other than free before 10 at the club'. I think this is a wonderful statement and it encourages black people to reject the notion of style over content as that is what the film does as well.Added to this the wellrounded nature of the film is a diatribe from Cedric The Entertainer who's performance is almost as hilarious as his standup act about black icons such as Rosa Parks Jesse Jackson and Martin Luther King. This is probably the most provocative section of the film and initially made me question the validity of these icons but after reflection it made me realized that even Martin Luther King was a human being with flaws but that doesn't take away from his legacy. Regardless what's been said about Jesse Jackson he's still the first black man to run for President and nothing will ever take that away from him.While Cedric the Entertainer took most of the acting plaudits this was a great ensemble piece that was well acted all round. My only gripe is that why can't other films of this nature stay true to black culture but also have a cinematic soul".

	schema:reviewBody "Thanks Ice Cube. You did a great job in creating and showcasing a part of AfricanAmerican life that was truetolife. There were so many diverse elements that all came together they seem too many to mention. But all of the main characters had a measure of character development and an intimacy that you couldn't forget.Even the minor characters played a big role such as Lamar J. David Shanks. Though introduced briefly very early in the movie he played a major but again brief role near the end. Minor character major input. The robbery of the convenience store five characters interwoven all with lessons to learn Craig Ice Cube Ricky Nash Michael Ealy Detective Williams Tom Wright Samir Parvesh Cheena and of course JD Anthony Anderson. The timing in various scenes were impeccable. The following sequence the radio voice of Chicago deejay Howard Magee Billy's mother ? Gabby Jasmine Randle Billy Lahmard J. Tate and JD was wonderfully choreographed.I know some will say Hey it was predictable. I knew beforehand the resolution of some most or all of the character's plights. And that may be true. But it's the manner in which each character was interwoven how one touched another and yet crisscrossed each other that gave this movie special meaning. How each character had their strengths or weaknesses to overcome. Great stories being told by Mark Brown Don D. Scott Marshall Todd and with Tim Story's direction. Every major character was and is a character study.Terence Blanchard does an admirable job supporting the scenes with his score.And regarding the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks controversy the writers qualified that diatribe very clearly as it progressed. Did people hear just want they wanted to hear?Another important feature that I admire was the honesty sometimes brutal on other issues such as foreigners owning businesses in the AfricanAmerican community or how dangerous it can be for anyone living in certain parts of the ghetto or how we yes I'm AfricanAmerican help keep each other from prospering.It wasn't until I started viewing Barbershop a second time and dissecting it where I saw additional insightful and valuable revelations. An example being Hustle Guy DeRay Davis. Dogs and Pampers? Many times we see the local hustler as a comedic tool hustling whatever heshe can get their hands on. But he's only trying to earn a living void of a storefront for lack of investment capital. And we find out how valuable Hustle Guy is also before the movie ends. Minor character major message.If you haven't seen it see it. If you've seen it and just saw it for it's entertainment value see it again for some valuable lessons.Not only will it be in my movie collection but it will be used as a teaching tool for my grandsons and granddaughters if I'm blessed with any.Believe it or not to me Eddie Cedric the Entertainer's character was the most unbelievable. Not that Eddie wasn't valuable because he was. It was Cedric's interpretation of Eddie and the lack of age lines on his face that was a pure turn off for me. For those reasons I wanted to remove 1 point. But because of the strength of the other characters and the story I'm keeping it a 10.The 7.1 rating as of this writing is an injustice to the quality and caliber of this production.I give it a 10.00 haircut plus a 5.00 tip.Great job Ice Cube to you and your production company Cube Vision. Great job.".

	schema:headline " Talk About a Real Clip Joint....In More Ways Than One.";
	schema:reviewBody "Hilarious picture that is held together just well enough by a somewhat mediocre screenplay to be one of the funnier movies of the past few years. In innercity Chicago barbershop owner Ice Cube hates where his life is at. He has a very pregnant wife Jazsmin Lewis and is drowning in debt due to his late father's apparent lack of business sense. He looks at the shop as a burden and wants to unload it to shady neighborhood businessman Keith David and his very large bodyguard DeRay Davis. What Cube does not realize is just how important the business is to many in the neighborhood and he also fails to realize that David cares nothing about the people and wants to turn the place into a gentleman's club. Some of the other cutters include intellectual Sean Patrick Thomas West African immigrant Leonard Earl Howze racially confused white boy Troy Garity twotime criminal Michael Ealy lonely and outofplace Eve who is involved with twotiming boyfriend Jason Winston George and priceless veteran barberloudmouth Cedric The Entertainer very politically incorrect as well. Simultaneously two local losers Anthony Anderson and Lahmard Tate have stolen an ATM machine from a convenient store near Cube's barbershop. The two try and try to get the money that is not even inside out with painstakingly outlandish results. Unwittingly they have taken an empty money machine. AfricanAmericans like Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson rubbished this movie as being demeaning and rude to black communities. This was never the intention of the filmmakers I don't think. Cedric has a tongue of acid here as he takes on Jackson Sharpton O.J. Simpson Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Rosa Parks Rodney King and even Walter Payton. I believe the real point of Cedric's character is to show that the titled location is a place of comfort and respect regardless of an individual's views or perspectives. In this regard it makes you realize just what a closeknit group the characters are to each other. All the players are very different and sometimes don't like one another but still they respect and welcome everyone else. Overall I liked the project even though it is not the most fundamentally effective film ever made by a longshot. Comedic timing and fresh characters make a subpar script and hohum direction look much better than they really are. Watch for former Michigan FabFiver and current NBA standout Jalen Rose as one of the many diverse customers. 4 stars out of 5.".

Cedric the Entertainer was good but not truly believable as an elderly man. Ice Cube turned in a quite good performance. In some of his previous films I had thought he was pretty good but rather onedimensional. Anaconda Three Kings Here he definitely extends his acting range enough to be taken seriously. And wherever the onenamed Eve came from she nailed her character. There's a lot more to this movie than the controversial lines from Eddie Cedric. It was interesting to see some black characters be aware of and concerned about the pathologies in the black community. But I guess this is spoken of only in barbershops or elsewhere away from whites. Overall definitely worth a look. Grade B".

He has an incredible relationship with the camera.  He has charisma that you cannot learn in all the drama workshops in creation.  He has authentic charm. He does not overplay his character and believe me it would have been easy to go that route. I've recognized some talent before they became stars and this guy has it.  I could not take my eyes off him for a second.  I think a star is born.Eve is also very good and has a future in movies if she wants one.  If she could just keep track of her damn apple juice. Cedric makes the movie.  He's the heart of the movie the center and hilarious to boot.  I watched this movie three times to make sure I didn't miss any of his dialogue.  I've seen MUCH worse performances receive Oscar nominations and its a real injustice that he was ignored. He's just great.For an old timer like me it was also nice to hear The Staple Singers over the closing credits too. On the other hand...Ice Cube does not register more than one emotion the subplot wAnthony Anderson and the cash machine is unworthy of the rest of the movie and Keith David who I normally love is terrible.This review is not as mixed as it may appear to be.  I rated it an '8' mostly cause of Ealy and Cedric. I may not be seeing Barbershop 2 anytime soon obviously not because I didn't enjoy the first one but because I don't support or have interest in sequels.  They're not worth the time and all the producers are really saying is that they had an idea did well with it now want to exploit every good feeling you had about the first one. Almost no movies require a sequel anyway.".

However the film frequently cuts to an annoying and mostly unfunny subplot about two bumbling crooks Anthony Anderson and Lahmard Tate trying to break into a stolen ATM machine. This is almost entirely unrelated to anything else in the film and even though it connects with the main plot at the end it still feels like dead weight that could have easily been entirely cut from the movie.This is a good movie full of heart and worth checking out just for the performances by Cube and Cedric as well as the good tunes on the soundtrack.

Producers were quick to place rapperselfproclaimed actor Ice Cube in another dayinthehood comedydrama as soon as copies of the equally drab Friday and its sequel hit sales racks. Here the viewer is given a look at the day in the lives of characters in a south side Chicago barbershop hence the clever title.

	schema:headline " BAD movie! A tiresome string of lame and insulting cliches";
	schema:reviewBody "Barbershop is a deceptively BAD movie. The surface level setup is appealing and almost criticproof. Note the ensemble cast nonstandard nonplot virtually all black cast real people patois etc. The all white collegetown theater audience I attended the movie with gave numerous arthouse chuckles those selfconscious and forced public laughs that selfappointed phonyartsy cognoscenti wannabes whip out for foreign movies such as Amelie and offcenter domestic fare such as Barbershop.Please note Amelie was a GOOD movie but not a great one in my opinion. The fawning and toadying over it by the artsy wannabes was the only unpleasant thing about it. Barbershop is not even good however so the fawning of the wannabes is not just unpleasant it is actually embarrassing recall the old fairy tale wherein the emperor walks around naked while the toadying subjects trick themselves into admiring his new clothes. Well same here Barbershop in my opinion is one totally naked dude!The characterizations in Barbershop were thin and tiresome media cliches. Everyone was depicted as mean selfish dishonest stupid and argumentative. Sure such people DO exist in all cultures and all communities but somehow the collection and presentation here was unconvincing and actually insulting. Barbershop is the worst kind of artistic laziness because it parades itself as bold truthful somehow reallife and nittygritty where in fact it is a sloppy rehash of old TV characters and already passe collegecircuit tripe. Overall the movie is lame and boring.Upon arriving home from Barbershop I flipped on the TV for something entertaining and I saw 20 minutes of Eddie Murphy in Coming to America. Murphy's movie has its faults too but is very entertaining if light fare. Watching one of the barbershop scenes in Coming to America I saw a quick brilliant and effective execution of the entire concept that Barbershop the movie struggled with yet failed to deliver.So if you want a truly funny version of a day in life of an innercity barbershop populated with diverse and endearing characters go out and rent something else. I gave Barbershop a 1 out of 10.".

The whole Idea of what trouble it is to steal an ATM machine and then what happens when you borrow money from the wrong people was like a vehicle to progress when it comes to comedy in this film.I guess my take on Barbershop is that the acting is very much OK the comedy is well delivered and always straight to the point causing you the watcher to make regular withdrawals at the laugh bank. The movie was like a helping hand to acting newcomers Eve and Michael Ealy and it featured some wellrounded actors like Anthony Anderson Cedric the Entertainer and Keith David.Barbershop makes you laugh all through and plays on the issue that bothers many What matters most me or others? Well that was the question Calvin Palmer Jr. had to answer as he Calvin played by Ice Cube was faced with a dilemma he either sells the barbershop and chase his dreams or keep it and continue to slug it out with life.Well Calvin decided to go with the later believing his dream is bigger and better so he gave up the barbershop that he inherited from his father by selling it to Lester Wallace Keith David who fooled Calvin to thinking he will still keep it as a barbershop when he actually will just keep the name Calvin's Barbershop and turn the shop to a gentleman's bar.After a while Calvin learnt he had made a big mistake then he decided to take back the money which ended up being the whole problem that the film is based on well actually that is half of what the film is based on because let's not forget the theft of an ATM machine by JD Anthony Anderson and Billy who believed that they could pry an ATM machine open with power tools.I just can't tell you which was funnier to watch The tale of the ATM or Eddie Cedric the Entertainer in the barbershop. Both were just funny to the core and in the end of the whole movie both incident ended up in the middle with everyone going home happy.The huge success of the movie led to a sequel Barbershop 2 Back in Business being done two years later and then a SpinOff Beauty Shop. Both movies didn't make as much money as the first and didn't get as much critical approval also.So if you are like me looking for some good homemade laughs go see barbershop again.www.lagsreviews.com".

	schema:reviewBody "After digging through Ice Cube's filmography and finding some mediocre films like All About the Benjamins and Janky Promoters I finally found a gem shining out from the pile. Barbershop is to smart to have its characters fall into an endless pit of clichs. It knows that somewhere these characters exist and they give them a sense of individuality. They are being themselves not who they should be. And not what movies expect them to be.Barbershop takes place all in one normal work day. Calvin Cube runs the barbershop that was once occupied by his father and grandfather. Calvin gets by working there but isn't as into cutting hair as his former generations. Desperate to try and get his record company on its feet he sells the shop to a shady loanshark named Lester David. Regretting his deal he tries to undue the damage and call of the negotiation but Lester refuses.The other subplot is two bumbling thieves Anderson and Tate steal an ATM machine and spend the whole film trying to get inside to the money. Their antics are idiotic and sometimes humorous but ultimately these two subplots make the film a little less enjoyable.When I look back on Barbershop I will remember very funny dialog realistic characters and an enjoyable setting. I will not remember the loan shark or the idiot thieves. If the whole movie would've been set in a barbershop with these characters I would've loved it even more. The screenwriter and the director probably figured it would be too boring. But with these characters it probably wouldn't.The rating seems to hold back the film as well. A PG13 rating on any comedy movie holds it back from being not necessarily funny but daring. Some comedies like Just Married for example could've been better if they would've gone further and not watered their material down. Barbershop doesn't water it down too much but you can tell at times the characters are holding back their true feelings.The employees at the barbershop are some of the funniest and cheeriest of people you'll ever meet. We have Ricky a felon Jimmy a College graduate looking to make more out of his alive Terri a hostile women with a passion and devotion for apple juice Issac the token white barber who says he is just as black as the other employees in the shop Dinka the Nigerian barber with a love for poetry and harbors a crush on Terri and my personal favorite the sixty year old veteran barber Eddie who seems to be on a continuous break.These characters have their own place and purpose and each are as welcomed as the next. Barbershop has enough passion and soul to be labeled a drama or even realistic fiction. It's a comedy but not always. I feel that if the two subplots were removed the tonality would completely change and we would have a bunch of people doing what they do best talking and cutting hair. It's more than a barbershop it's a constant social hour amongst employees and customers.Starring Ice Cube Anthony Anderson Sean Patrick Thomas Eve Michael Ealy Troy Garity Leonard Earl Howze Keith David Lahmard Tate DeRay Davis and Cedric the Entertainer. Directed by Tim Story.".

I thought I was going to hate this movie but I watched it and it was actually pretty good. I saw in 2004 Queen Latifah is in Barbershop 2 back in Business Queen Latifah stars in this movie. Queen Latifah is staring in a movie called The Bueaty Shop just like the Barbershop but it is an all girl salon. I think that may be what is called a re make or a Barbershop 3. Personally I think that it is a all over good movie. If they wanted to take a new level is to make a trilogy and make a new thing called Funky Barbershop something like that. The point is is that this movie is a second of the best on my list. I would vote this a A for it's effort oh and the funny thing is it is filmed in Chicago but the set looked like it was filmed in Philedalphia. That was just funny. Keenan Thomapson should have been in the first one too. I rate this move A and 1010 along with Barbershop 2 Back in Business.".

	schema:reviewBody "Army of One is an actioner obviously made by people who truly love the genre. It was directed and produced by Vic Armstrong stunt coordinator and second unit director on films like Total Recall Starship Troopers and the two latest Bondfilms Tomorrow Never Dies and The World Is Not Enough. This man is responsible for some of the best action sequences ever made so he obviously knows what he's doing.The film was written by Steven Pressfield. He cowrote Steven Seagal's first film Above the Law as well as Freejack. Based on this film he might just be the perfect writer for tough action films. He successfully takes a basic concept a man convicted of a murder he didn't commit sets out to find the true killers and get his revenge and elevates it above similar films with his characters scenes and dialogue. He takes the film and it's subject matter with just the right dose of selfirony but never lets it become a parody. The dialogue flows nicely and occasionally there are some truly classic lines for example Alfonso You're not a very nice person. You've hurt several people. Lundgren I never said I was running for pope.This is quite a bit smarter than your average actioner. As I said the plot is formulaic and fans like myself want an action film to have a formulaic plot but the characters and dialogue are interesting. Dolph Lundgren has the right stuff for an action hero. He's got the looks and the voice and he knows his way around action scenes. But it's George Segal and Beau Starr as the nagging duo who really steal the show.Of course there's the beautiful woman Kristian Alfonso as Lundgren's sidekick but they don't portray her as a helpless victim. Instead she's a cop and more than able to take care of herself. Luckily she does still wear tight jeans Lundgren even notices this and teases her about it! and there's the obligatory love scene. The scene where Lundgren and Alfonso check in a hotel is a classic! Alfonso immediately takes a shower and even asks if she has enough time to wash her panties!. Alfonso uses a body double who turns around and around for the camera to the extent that the scene is almost comical. This scene is so gratuitous that it's hard not to like it. Because the film shows so much class in other scenes it becomes clear that this scene isn't just here to fill time and show TA. It's here because an action movie like this always has gratuitous nudity. It's one of the trademarks of this masculine genre and if you love the genre you will include a scene like this.All this is nice and well but what really counts is the action. And the action here is absolutely breathtaking! The actionscenes are choreographed so beautifully that I'm still impressed while watching them although I've seen the film for over 30 times. First there's a major shootout during which Lundgren kills probably over 30 guys using his fists a shotgun and two handguns this ain't John Woo and it doesn't really try to be but the fans of his style will probably still like this. When he runs out of bullets he just picks up another gun from the floor. Once again this scene is not a parody but it is so overthetop that it obviously isn't meant to be taken too seriously. Anyway there are some great stunts here and Armstrong has directed the scene flawlessly. All this amounts to one of the coolest shootouts in recent history and one which has since been copied in countless bactioners. Then there's the car chase with a red Ferrari and a black Lamborghini. Phenomenal!The score by Joel Goldsmith is brilliant. There's a strong theme atmospheric background music for the opening scenes and really energetic music during the action scenes. Also the cinematography by Daniel L. Turrett works well. And even the acting is pretty good. As I said Dolph Lundgren makes a good hero Alfonso has the looks and Segal and Starr are responsible for the film's class and laughs there aren't that many laughs in the film but when there are they work.Army of One is a film which might seem like just another action movie but as a true fan of the genre I recognize when the director is just filming something for money and when he's passionate about his work. And this is clearly a film made with passion for the genre. This isn't a story that needs to be told nor is this anything original or groundbreaking as far as the story goes but this is definitely one of the best action films made in the 90s and a mustsee for fans of the genre. I can't recommend this highly enough. I give this a full 10. Kudos for everyone involved!The film is available as R and unratedversions. The unratedversion adds one fight scene and has a slightly different ending. Otherwise they're the same.".

	schema:headline " Where's the multi disc DVD release?";
	schema:reviewBody "What do you get if you cross Dolph Lundgren with a red shirt and a red car? A pretty good movie.What's the main problem with this movie? It's not available on DVDBlu Ray.Why? Your guess is as good as mine. A movie that I've only heard about through a friend repeated rants about why it should be on DVD and how it's such a good film I must admit I had my doubts. But with everything being on DVD these days it's shocking and a sin that this isn't. When literally everything these days is available  whether it be dead cheap or hideously expensive  from your TV movies adapted from books to your endless TV shows the question should be where is Joshua Tree's release? Is it because it comes from the same name as a U2 song? Hence the name change to Army Of One in places which makes very little sense. The rights to this movie are probably floating around somewhere just waiting for someone to snap them out and give this film the true release it deserves.From the opening shots it starts as an almost peaceful movie. It's mainly set in a baking hot desert and it stars the very wonderful genuinestraightuptoughguy Dolph Lundgren as Santee. When he's not speaking Dolph just steals the film even just by standing there. He's just driving along when suddenly something happens and he's arrested for the murder of a patrolman. But he didn't do it and is being set up. He escapes and grabs a hostage supposedly for her car but I suppose she has other attributes that Santee plans to make use of. Kristian Alfonso makes a stereotypical female hostage role her own by not only giving as good as she gets but actually providing a lot of chemistry with Dolph. The scene where they are handcuffed together and lying in bed was so sizzling that I would have needed a cold shower afterwards.The only grumble I have with Joshua Tree and it's a tiny one I promise and you probably won't notice it is the storyline. Is that the best storyline in the world ever? No. Is it the worst storyline in the world ever? No. But it's nothing that we haven't all seen before. But I do think the film would have been a lot worse if it hadn't had the delight of Dolph's onscreen presence. I mean this guy has faced up to his old nemesis in The Expendables recently and there's another reason why this film should be released.The action in Joshua Tree is simply incredible. There's one particular scene where Dolph kills all these Chinese guys who seem to be never ending and seem to double in numbers every time two of them get killed. And boy do they get killed! The actors also make great use of their very short screen time by overacting their death scenes  it does have to been seen. There are quite a few well known faces in this from George Segal to Matt Battaglia has appeared in every TV show going it seems from Baywatch to Sabrina The Teenage Witch to Friends  Phoebe's boyfriend Vince in TOW Ross's Thing  if you don't recognise the face you'll recognise the voice. But the only ones you really pay attention to are Dolph  Kristian.Now if someone can just cough up the money literally for this film to be rereleased at the cinemas and then have a major blu rayDVD release with plenty of extras it would make my friend and me very happy. And it would get a whole lot of other fans. So  cough up!!!".

When literally everything these days is available  whether it be dead cheap or hideously expensive  from your TV movies adapted from books to your endless TV shows the question should be where is Joshua Tree's release? Is it because it comes from the same name as a U2 song? Hence the name change to Army Of One in places which makes very little sense. The rights to this movie are probably floating around somewhere just waiting for someone to snap them out and give this film the true release it deserves.From the opening shots it starts as an almost peaceful movie. It's mainly set in a baking hot desert and it stars the very wonderful genuinestraightuptoughguy Dolph Lundgren as Santee. When he's not speaking Dolph just steals the film even just by standing there. He's just driving along when suddenly something happens and he's arrested for the murder of a patrolman. But he didn't do it and is being set up. He escapes and grabs a hostage supposedly for her car but I suppose she has other attributes that Santee plans to make use of. Kristian Alfonso makes a stereotypical female hostage role her own by not only giving as good as she gets but actually providing a lot of chemistry with Dolph. The scene where they are handcuffed together and lying in bed was so sizzling that I would have needed a cold shower afterwards.The only grumble I have with Joshua Tree and it's a tiny one I promise and you probably won't notice it is the storyline. Is that the best storyline in the world ever? No. Is it the worst storyline in the world ever? No. But it's nothing that we haven't all seen before. But I do think the film would have been a lot worse if it hadn't had the delight of Dolph's onscreen presence. I mean this guy has faced up to his old nemesis in The Expendables recently and there's another reason why this film should be released.The action in Joshua Tree is simply incredible. There's one particular scene where Dolph kills all these Chinese guys who seem to be never ending and seem to double in numbers every time two of them get killed. And boy do they get killed! The actors also make great use of their very short screen time by overacting their death scenes  it does have to been seen. There are quite a few well known faces in this from George Segal to Matt Battaglia has appeared in every TV show going it seems from Baywatch to Sabrina The Teenage Witch to Friends  Phoebe's boyfriend Vince in TOW Ross's Thing  if you don't recognise the face you'll recognise the voice. But the only ones you really pay attention to are Dolph  Kristian.Now if someone can just cough up the money literally for this film to be rereleased at the cinemas and then have a major blu rayDVD release with plenty of extras it would make my friend and me very happy. And it would get a whole lot of other fans. So  cough up!!!";

I had taped it off Sky Movies and expected it to be just another action film and would have enjoyed it had it been just that. But there is a very quiet tongueincheek feel and a slightly ironic edge to the film that really appeals to me. Unfortunately the version I saw was sanitized by the BBFC to the point of ridiculousness.Dolph Lundgren stars as Wellman Anthony Santee yeah you read that correctly a racecar driver who is sent down for a 2035 year stretch in the funhouse for the murder of a highway patrolman. Only he didn't do it and escapes custody in order to trap the real culprit. Along the way he kidnaps Rita Mareck Kristian Alfonso an offduty police officer for the sole purpose of using her 4x4 as an escape vehicle. But Rita's natural detective abilities and curiosity make her stick around and observe the plot as it unfolds. It's fun watching her being manhandled just as she secretly likes by Santee who is just the kind of genuine straightup tough guy she's been looking for.George Segal doing a Groucho Marx impersonation and Beau Starr are the crooked cops out to get Santee and spare no effort lying and sleazing their way across the desert before he exposes their corruption. The odds are against Santee but behind the wheel of a fast car he can hit the dirt and disappear without a trace.The action in Joshua Tree is incredible. The centerpiece scene in which Santee massacres half of China in a desert chopshop has to be seen to be believed. It goes beyond violence and into an orgy of blood and death that very few movies manage to reach. There are also a few references to other films most notably the I need a shotgun scene from The Getaway as well as the rather Hitchcockian wrong man on the run theme.Joel Goldsmith provides a lovely musical score too full of melodic atmosphere and pounding rhythms. It's never been available on CD which is a shame.The film itself has had a truly shocking release history. The long defunct Live Entertainment had the video rights back in the day but they changed the title to avoid confusion with the U2 music video. When the time came to release a DVD they just ported the video transfer to disc instead of giving us a proper 2.351 version. The rights have since been lost and the film will no doubt fall into obscurity which is a shame. Vic Armstrong probably THE top action man in Hollywood never got to do a definitive Director's Cut of the film and for his maiden voyage and so far only as a standalone film director it's probably heartbreaking and very frustrating for him.I can't say the film is perfect though. There are far too many shots of generic police cars driving through the desert. Cutting out all this dead weight would have tightened the pace considerably. I can't help but grimace every time one of these pointless cutaways pops up.It's nearly impossible to find Joshua Tree these days but if you do happen upon it preferably with the shorter ending and not the horrible extended version then it is well worth the time and money.".

	schema:reviewBody "Adventure  thriller movies are always big on action. At some point through the running time decisions have to be made whether to accept fate or try and change the oncoming outcome. This kind of balance needs to be checked because if not monitored either the viewer will end up being stuck in an explosive marathon in nothing but action after action without any story or too much exposition and no action at all. No matter what the extreme either or will bore its viewer. Unfortunately that is the case for this action flick and surprisingly it suffers from both extremes believe it or not. After being framed for murder of a police officer Santee Dolph Lundgren is sent to a penitentiary only to almost be killed by the man who framed him. After escaping Santee takes one offduty cop named Rita Marek Kristian Alfonso hostage while having Lt. Franklin L. Severence George Segal on his tale close behind.Directed by usual stunt coordinator veteran Vic Armstrong his directorial debut and written by Steven Pressfield Above the Law 1988 this action thriller is very low on the entertainment and high tension meter. There's only a few good areas to point out. Its strongest element are its cinematography captured by Daniel L. Turrett. Although this is Turrett's ONLY cinematography credit to date it is decent. The rest of Turrett's work is credited as camera operator and although that is a totally different task Turrett did what he could. The entirety of this movie is set in the desert and Turrett shot as much footage as he could get to include wide landscape and long running mountain ranges. It sure is nice to look at. The second best aspect to this movie are most of its cast and how they act. Sadly the cast that is respectable are not on screen as much as the actual main cast.For Lundgren himself there is no complaint. He has all the best lines and works well with that alone for this particular film. Aside from him though George Segal as the Lt. Severence is wholesomely uninteresting because of his sniveling voice. Even the young Kristian Alfonso is remarkably banal in her performance. Yet audiences will have supporting cast performances from the underrated Geoffrey Lewis as the local Sheriff helping Lt. Severence. Backing up Lewis is a younger Nick Chinlund as a Deputy. He's easy to pick out. Then there's the cameos not really but because they show up for all of about 5 minutes. Ken Foree known from George A. Romero's Dawn of the Living Dead 1978 and Texas Chain Saw Massacre III Leatherface 1990 plays Eddie Santee's partner. Along with Foree is another young Khandi Alexander playing Eddie's wife. Too bad they didn't have longer roles. Finally the last part that works here is the action partially. What is meant by partially is that the shootouts are well staged and set up. Those are fun.But now we hit the bad territory. The bad side to the action are the car chases and fist fight scenes. For sequences you'd think would move quickly and get your attention does not happen here. This is the movie's biggest problem pacing. When the sequences occur it gets old really fast. So quickly in fact it feels like its drawn out just for padding purposes. Then there's the scenes that involve exposition which don't even get told correctly. This is said because Lundgren's character says nothing about what's going on the whole time. The only way viewers will understand what's going on is by listening to Alfonso's character  why? Because she asks all the questions that don't get answered and she figures them out on her own. The thing is the information to understanding this plot is held back for such a prolonged amount of time there comes a point in the movie where the viewer just may not care anymore and wish for the film to end because they won't understand why things are being done without any reason.Pressfield's writing is very mediocre here. Another thing that is eye roll inducing is how clich the execution is. You have the protagonist a muscular dude out fighting the way he wants to and doesn't care if he dies and runs across this hot young chick. There's no guessing to what'll happen between them because it has been seen time and time again in these kinds of actionadventure thrillers. Of course they're going to hookup why wouldn't they? There's also a subplot that sort of explains Santee's relationship with an old man played by Bert Remsen but it has no effect on the plot so why it was included was beyond understanding. Lastly bringing the list of bad components to a close is composer Joel Goldsmith's musical score son of legendary composer Jerry Goldmsith. Here Joel Goldsmith's score hardly warrants any recognition even with a couple of repeating themes for certain scenes. Much of the score uses the cheap 1 or 2 instruments that would be required for a Richard Band production and its more disengaging than anything else. Thankfully it hasn't been released to the public.The title correctly portrays what it says and that's Dolph Lundgren mowing down bad guys without getting a scratch. But this doesn't happen that often. Besides good looking cinematography and a few actor cameos that tease the audience more than anything else this cat and mouse chase is boring half the time with bad pacing clichd writing and poor sounding music.".

Along with Foree is another young Khandi Alexander playing Eddie's wife. Too bad they didn't have longer roles. Finally the last part that works here is the action partially. What is meant by partially is that the shootouts are well staged and set up. Those are fun.But now we hit the bad territory. The bad side to the action are the car chases and fist fight scenes. For sequences you'd think would move quickly and get your attention does not happen here. This is the movie's biggest problem pacing. When the sequences occur it gets old really fast. So quickly in fact it feels like its drawn out just for padding purposes. Then there's the scenes that involve exposition which don't even get told correctly. This is said because Lundgren's character says nothing about what's going on the whole time. The only way viewers will understand what's going on is by listening to Alfonso's character  why? Because she asks all the questions that don't get answered and she figures them out on her own. The thing is the information to understanding this plot is held back for such a prolonged amount of time there comes a point in the movie where the viewer just may not care anymore and wish for the film to end because they won't understand why things are being done without any reason.Pressfield's writing is very mediocre here. Another thing that is eye roll inducing is how clich the execution is. You have the protagonist a muscular dude out fighting the way he wants to and doesn't care if he dies and runs across this hot young chick. There's no guessing to what'll happen between them because it has been seen time and time again in these kinds of actionadventure thrillers. Of course they're going to hookup why wouldn't they? There's also a subplot that sort of explains Santee's relationship with an old man played by Bert Remsen but it has no effect on the plot so why it was included was beyond understanding. Lastly bringing the list of bad components to a close is composer Joel Goldsmith's musical score son of legendary composer Jerry Goldmsith. Here Joel Goldsmith's score hardly warrants any recognition even with a couple of repeating themes for certain scenes. Much of the score uses the cheap 1 or 2 instruments that would be required for a Richard Band production and its more disengaging than anything else. Thankfully it hasn't been released to the public.The title correctly portrays what it says and that's Dolph Lundgren mowing down bad guys without getting a scratch. But this doesn't happen that often. Besides good looking cinematography and a few actor cameos that tease the audience more than anything else this cat and mouse chase is boring half the time with bad pacing clichd writing and poor sounding music.";

It marks the theatrical first unit directorial debut for Vic Armstrong a longtime veteran of stunt work and second unit direction. This is one man who knows how to deliver action on a grand scale and he does so here. He makes sure that this always energetic thriller never stops moving. The story isn't anything special and there is some bad dialogue but at the same time there are some good lines such as the one mentioned in this review summary. Joshua Tree isn't quite wall to wall action at least not to begin with but it definitely kicks into another gear in its second half starting with an homage to John Woo an over the top massacre of bad guys by our stoic hero Wellman Santee Dolph Lundgren.Santee ain't no angel which is refreshing. He's been a runner of exotic cars but things go very wrong when a highway cop pulls over him and his partner Eddie a much too briefly seen Ken Foree. Soon he's in jail framed for murder but gets his chance to escape. Knowing he was set up he embarks on a mission to find the man who he knows was responsible  and get paid. Exhibiting some ruthlessness he's willing to take a hostage Rita Marek Kristian Alfonso. It turns out that he's actually abducted a sheriffs' deputy who's a pretty tough cookie and Rita decides to stick by his side when she's convinced of his innocence. Hot on Santees' trail are cops including Geoffrey Lewis as Sheriff Cepeda and a pair of detectives Severence George Segal and Rudisill Beau Starr.If one is partial to scenes of very cool cars driving very fast Joshua Tree does deliver the goods especially in an intense climactic chase that also shows off the beauty of the desert vistas the movie was smartly shot using the 2.351 aspect ratio. But the aforementioned massacre of assorted Chinese goons is a beauty with all of the bloodletting going on the hammy acting of the guys getting shot and Santees' acrobatics.Dolph's never been that much of an actor but then he doesn't need to be in this sort of thing. He just needs to be totally bad ass which he does succeed at. Alfonso is very good at both providing the eye candy and playing a sidekick who can take care of herself. Lewis is under utilized but Segal and Starr are fun and the supporting cast features a number of familiar faces that add to the enjoyment Bert Remsen who's a hoot in his one scene Michael Paul Chan Matt Battaglia gorgeous Khandi Alexander and Nick Chinlund.Fans of this genre should be more than satisfied. As testosteronefuelled escapism goes this is pretty good and above average.Seven out of 10.".

	schema:headline " It's a true Shame";
	schema:reviewBody "Of all the foreign action stars mass produced and exported to America and cast in over the top movies I feel that Mr. Lundgren is my favorite. Schwarzenegger comes off as unrealistic. Vandam is just laughable. And honestly anyone else is just forgettable. When it comes down to it Dolph Lundgren is VERY underrated and until I watched 'Joshua Tree' I did not even come close to knowing it. To me he was just the bad guy in the Rocky movie that I never watched.Lundgren is a steamroller. He plows through cops thugs and anyone else that gets in his way. They are left in a wake of insanity and the whole while he keeps a cool composure and it never gets overly comical. 'Joshua Tree' is in no way realistic though it has a grittiness to it that movies like 'True Lies' and 'Commando' will never have. Casting Schwarzenegger as 'John Kimble' or 'Harry Trasker' takes me out of the film. With that brutal accent and and the overbearing brawn he will never be a street smart American protagonist that he is cast to be and this is detrimental to his character and the movie as a whole. Lundgren is the antithesis. He has the cold European gaze but he adds a different flare that actually fits. He can riddle a body with bullets and give a snappy line and the audience will laugh but they are laughing with him and not at him.Action directors today can learn a lot from this film. It should be mandatory viewing for action directors in film school. Directors today rely too heavily on CGI. This movie is raw. Everything was done by hand and it adds to the realism that a Schwarzenegger flick like I mentioned before lacks. Sure you can see camera reflections on shiny surfaces and guns fire countless rounds without any need to reload but it is just fun.I stated that Lundgren was a superior actor when compared to his European action star peers that does not by any means make the acting in this movie great. Regardless the characters are vibrant and colorful. The cops are crooked and gaudy. The babes are buxom and bodacious and any all stereotypes are laid on thick and smooth.Without giving away a whole lot the infamous warehouse scene is amazing a true high point. I am sure this movie was not the first to do a shot like this but it was executed wonderfully or at least a hell of a lot better than many action movies that would follow. When combined with the great car chases and countless fight scenes I cannot speak highly enough.From all of this I cannot help but wonder what the world would be like today if it were Lundgren cast in The Terminator or Predator. I will definitely check out more of his work and rewatch 'Joshua Tree' again and again.On a side note does anyone know why my copy of the film is titled 'Army of One' instead of 'Joshua Tree'?".

	onyx:emotionText "Of all the foreign action stars mass produced and exported to America and cast in over the top movies I feel that Mr. Lundgren is my favorite. Schwarzenegger comes off as unrealistic. Vandam is just laughable. And honestly anyone else is just forgettable. When it comes down to it Dolph Lundgren is VERY underrated and until I watched 'Joshua Tree' I did not even come close to knowing it. To me he was just the bad guy in the Rocky movie that I never watched.Lundgren is a steamroller. He plows through cops thugs and anyone else that gets in his way. They are left in a wake of insanity and the whole while he keeps a cool composure and it never gets overly comical. 'Joshua Tree' is in no way realistic though it has a grittiness to it that movies like 'True Lies' and 'Commando' will never have. Casting Schwarzenegger as 'John Kimble' or 'Harry Trasker' takes me out of the film. With that brutal accent and and the overbearing brawn he will never be a street smart American protagonist that he is cast to be and this is detrimental to his character and the movie as a whole. Lundgren is the antithesis. He has the cold European gaze but he adds a different flare that actually fits. He can riddle a body with bullets and give a snappy line and the audience will laugh but they are laughing with him and not at him.Action directors today can learn a lot from this film. It should be mandatory viewing for action directors in film school. Directors today rely too heavily on CGI. This movie is raw. Everything was done by hand and it adds to the realism that a Schwarzenegger flick like I mentioned before lacks. Sure you can see camera reflections on shiny surfaces and guns fire countless rounds without any need to reload but it is just fun.I stated that Lundgren was a superior actor when compared to his European action star peers that does not by any means make the acting in this movie great. Regardless the characters are vibrant and colorful. The cops are crooked and gaudy. The babes are buxom and bodacious and any all stereotypes are laid on thick and smooth.Without giving away a whole lot the infamous warehouse scene is amazing a true high point. I am sure this movie was not the first to do a shot like this but it was executed wonderfully or at least a hell of a lot better than many action movies that would follow.

She's like a hurricane a really strong force of nature and we see that especially by the way the movie ends You just can be together with her or against her! The acting of Ludivine Sagnier is also superb by the way she plays this character she really does it very well!

	schema:reviewBody "Pieds Nus sur les Limaces 2010 literally means barefoot on slugs. We see Ludivine Sagnier and Diane Kruger as the two sisters Lily and Clara with different characters. Lily lives with her mother is extremely sensitive. She appears to be light autistic. Clara is the house wife of a lawyer and lives in Paris. The film begins with the fatal accident of their mother. She suffers a heart attack in the car and rolls slowly against a hay bale while Lily is still waving her goodbye. It brings Lily in trouble because she is left alone and can't take care of herself. She does all sorts of weird stuff but there is always a deeper meaning behind it. Strangers arrive at her place and seem to misuse the situation. Or at least her hospitality. Clara comes to the countryside and we get a game of attraction and repulsion between a civil city girl and a autistic moron. That leads to a lot of crazy situations. Lily is in love with the boy next door but cannot act accordingly and is almost f by three young boys. Diane saves her just in time. Eventually Clara is caught by the free life without obligations of Lily. She experiences a hot night with one of the strangers under the open sky. Lily has freed her sister! Well that kind of things. It ends that Lily and Clara find each other in the free living. They start selling the curiosities of Lily in an old van while crossing the country. How idyllic. Pieds Nus sur les Limaces is nicely filmed and the subject is interesting. Despite the truly impressive acting of Ludivine Sagnier and the good antichemistry with Diane Kruger Pieds Nus sur les Limaces does not really impressed me or touched me. I think the scenario is on one hand too clichd on the other hand too stilted. Already the death of the mother leads to a kind of incomprehension. The attempt of Clara to murder Lily in the bath is overthetop. Instead of shocked or moved I almost dropped out. But go see the movie for the two excellent French actresses!".

I think the scenario is on one hand too clichd on the other hand too stilted. Already the death of the mother leads to a kind of incomprehension. The attempt of Clara to murder Lily in the bath is overthetop. Instead of shocked or moved I almost dropped out. But go see the movie for the two excellent French actresses!";

Techine's subject may be what's in between humans in crisis but these referants give the film an almost religious dimension and also a sense of that inbetween the grey neither great heights nor depths.  Although the drama and Romance of the film's music thrillingly recalls Bernard Hermann and various plot elements borrow from films such as VERTIGO and NORTH BY NORTHWEST the film's calm distance prevents it from ever falling into such Hitchcockian traps as narrative excitement or humour.From what I can make out the film is a political thriller about how the murky realm of politics infringes on ordinary people not in the sense of laws and taxes but literally in terms of life and death.  The film is set on the eve of an important election which seems less like an open democratic contest than an underworld struggle for power.  Samson Gerard Depardieu a smalltime boxer is bribed to admit his abuse as a child by one of the candidates.Seeing the money as a possibility of escape for himself and his longtime unemployed fiancee Laure Isabelle Adjani he accepts but under pressure from the other candidate who gives him the same amount to keep schtum he decides to scarper with Laure to begin a new life.  Before they meet at the train station however Samson is kidnapped by the first set of thugs. Laure sleeps all night waiting for him  and this is crucial because the conventionalenough boxinggangster melodramatics take a bizarre dreamlike turn.Suffice it to say an assassin who is the spitting image of Samson probably because he's also played by Gerard Depardieu shoots him.  This is a bit confusing for those like myself with limited French but the rest of the film consists of the assassin chasing Laure for the money and then the two planning escape from the gangsterspoliticianspolice.  The VERTIGO idea of the lead character being forced to paralysingly watch as a lover is murdered reaches its  logical conclusion when Samson's burial is intercut death and rebirth with his assassin remaking himself in the boxer's image just as Scottie did Judy.So on one level the story is a gendered reclamation of VERTIGO.  Like Scottie Laure seems to have the active power in a plot which is in many ways about the development of the female character in a male genre.  The film opens with Laure masked like a terrorist or Muslim wending through bleak fog past an accident and the film in one way reveals this mystery removes the misogynistic idea that women are sphinxes to be worked out. But her power is eventually as passive as Scottie's witness the shocking denouement.  There is a very strong possibility like VERTIGO that the film is a dream  the splitting of her desire is very Bunuel and the nocturnal locations strange plot motivations and stylised movements are very dreamlike.The splitting of the male lead literalising a metaphorical current in French crime cinema becomes the determining motif of the miseenscene. The film is renowned for both its style and use of colour and while the latter wasn't much in evidence in the dreadful print I saw the yellow at the end should GLEAM the widescreen compositions are highly formalised symmetrical reflecting themselves suggesting wholes the plot continually rupture and the camera movements constantly travelling right or left often against the action ironically creating a static circularity. Unfortunately like much of the film this style is neither one thing or the other  it is too stylised to be realistic but too timid to be outlandishly artificial as a Chabrol.BAROCCO's analysis of power is similarly muted.  France in the 1970s  must have been a grim time an inverse to 1968 here revolution is threatened by the 'management' criminality corruption.  But Techine's analysis rarely goes beyond ironically showing smiling posters of candidates suggesting the complicity the media or setting political backroom activity in shrouded gangsterlike milieux.  It seems a pity to invoke Genet with theatrical metaphors and a very public brothel central here to ideas of family commerce politics and then not to do much with them.".

The chemistry between the two lead characters just doesn't feel right and it looks as if Tchin made a great error of judgement to cast Depardieu in the role of both Samson and his killer.  Certainly Depardieu makes little effort to differentiate the two characters except by wearing a wig and as a result the underlying premise of the plot is lost completely.However it is the general mood of the film that is the most irritating aspect of this film.  It is just so relentlessly grim and dark that it seems to stifle the plot and imbue the moments of great tension with an air of thirdrate melodrama.It is difficult to believe that with such a wealth of talent on both sides of the camera such a film could have failed so badly to hit its mark.".

It is odd to see the very young Isabelle Adjani when she still had puppy fat in her face as she does not look particularly like Isabelle Adjani at all except in the eyes at that age. It was a big mistake to cast Gerard Depardieu in the role of two characters one a boxer who is murdered and the other the killer who murdered him for money. When the boxer's girl friend Adjani shows no sign of recognition of Depardieu the killer when they meet we know the film is hopelessly contrived because anybody can see that it is Depardieu. This is really stretching things too far. The film is gloomy washedout laden with hopelessness a bleak vision. Andre Techine the director shows some directorial skill so that the film is not what one would call 'badly made'. It is instead badly conceived and a failure. Also it is rather affected to try to achieve some kind of mockprofundity by a 'study' of a girl who wants to get together with the killer of her boy friend. If this is meant to have some deep existential meaning it flops. The profundity can be measured in millimetres.".

The castle's ghost is also very funny and the battle between the Rosenstens and the Ravenfelds are superb. The elderly baroness and the young Gitta Nrby's controversy gives the movie an extra dimension.The funny scene at dinner Skal jeg sige det p den mde...Ja gr som jeg siger...meget vel......HA HA HA HA HA HA HA";

	schema:headline " Underrated and forgotten but classic Western";
	schema:reviewBody "Lee Van Cleef had already become an international star late in his career following his success in the Sergio Leone Spaghetti Westerns when he starred in Barquero made in 1970. The film is clearly influenced by the Spaghetti tradition most clearly displayed in the druggedup psychotic villain Jake Remy who bares similarities to the character of Indio in For a Few Dollars More. However Barquero is far superior to the many Spaghetti imitators and deserves to stand on its own as a great Western.The plot is fairly simple beginning with the massacre and plundering of a peaceful town by Jake Remy and his crew of assorted bandits. Their only escape from capture is to cross the river to safety but the only person who can help them is the Barquero played by Lee Van Cleef who refuses and a violent standoff ensues.The film is aided immeasurably by the performance of Warren Oates as Jake Remy in one of his best roles. Remy makes even most the evil Western characters look saintly in comparison as he kills and butchers anyone who gets in his path check out the scene in which he sleeps with a woman and then casually kills her and his only redeeming feature is his loyalty to his men. This is perhaps the only Western in which the bad guy is given more screen time than the hero and is one of the most complex villains ever seen on screen. Remy has a past which he is haunted by and is slowly driven mad by his determination to cross the river and by the stubbornness of the Barquero.The film does not really have a hero as the only two characters to resemble this are the Barquero and Mountain Phil a truly bizarre character excellently played by Forrest Tucker. The Barquero is prepared to help the endangered townsfolk against Remy but only because he wants to bed one of the women and Mountain Phil does not help out of kindness but more so because he is slightly insane.Barquero was directed by the undistinguished Gordon Douglas although he did direct the classic 1954 SciFihorror Them. Fans of Sam Peckinpah will be pleased to see the villainous pairing of Warren Oates and John Davis Chandler although Van Cleef fans may be disappointed as he is given little to do besides having to wear one of the worst shirts ever committed to film.Barquero should be seen by anyone who is serious about Westerns and is required viewing for fans of the great Warren Oates.".

Who will ultimately win this cat and mouse game as each leader tests the other's resolve in order to maintain control of the barge? The movie opens with a sensational 20 or so minute shootout where Remy's men open fire on a town of innocent people for their materials and valuables including bags of silver stolen from the bank. Remy and his men are so despicable they not only shoot the men but women as well.Travis and Phil uncover the truth about Remy's plans to use the barge to get across the river burning it down afterward thanks to the blabbering of Fair..a really young John Davis Chandlerwho they take prisoner. Getting across the river Travis will be damned if he'll give up his barge and Remy attempts through various methods to persuade him to. Kerwin Mathews is Jacob's French lieutenant the brains of their outfit attempting to convince him to split their loot evenly separating before things get out of hand. But Remy is determined to get that barge slowly driven to the brink of madness as Travis often outsmarts him including a successful rescue of a kidnapped squatter.The film is worth watching if just for the performance of Warren Oates who vividly and impressively conveys a madman deteriorating psychologically bit by bit as his attempts to retrieve the barge fail. Van Cleef oozes confidence and charisma..it's so effortless he's such a cool cat this guyas the cerebral hero and Tucker is an absolute hoot as his calm breezy undeterred comrade who remains loyal to him as they match wits with their enemies. Great closing gun battle as Travis gathers his troops together for one final showdown with Jacob Marquette and their goons as they attempt to get across the river another way.A legitimate sleeper definitely worth pursuing if you are a fan of Van Cleef and Oates.

What sets Barquero apart from all other westerns is that this is the first time that a horse opera has been made where the hero is a ferry man. Indeed he doesn't ride a horse he owns a ferry. In other words Barquero qualifies as unique. Furthermore the William Marks  George Schenck screenplay is simple clearcut but violent. The guys blast it out with each other and the filmmakers throw in a lot of tongueincheek tough guy humor.A crazy potsmoking outlaw Jake Remy Warren Oates of Return of the Seven and his bloodthirsty gang shoot up the town of Buckskinthough massacre might be a more descriptive wordand then hightail it for the border to make their getaway. Travis is the only man who stands between Remy and freedom and Travis isn't about to let Remy cross. A lot of bloodshed ensues as the villains try to make the crossing. Composer Dominic Frontiere contributes a memorable orchestral score. Lee Van Cleef is at his gimleteyed best and Warren Oates is as slimy as a villain can come. As Mountain Phil Forrest Tucker is fun to watch as a roughhewn frontiersman who joins forces with Travis. There's an amusing torture scene between iconic western character actor John Davis Chandler of The Outlaw Josy Wales and Forrest Tucker's mountain man. Surprisingly Mariette Hartley is cast as Travis' woman.One of the highlights of this offbeat western is the river attack when Jake's men construct small wooden craft and attack Travis. Lee Van Cleef had only recently made a name of himself in Europe as a star and this United Artists movie takes advantage of his rejuvenated career. Anybody who calls himself a Lee Van Cleef fan should definitely watch this solid shoot'em up.".

	schema:reviewBody "Around 1970 the Western genre had a new lease of life from the success of the Spaghetti Western.  This is one of many attempts to marry the classic Western with this new style and it does it quite convincingly.  In the title role we have Lee van Cleef as the most impressive ferryman in film history  making his colleague at the Styx worry about the security of his job.  Lee is up against Warren Oates and his bandits who need his ferry to transport their booty.  Consequently we are treated with the rare sight of a naval battle in a Western.The villains of this piece are rather traditional Western villains John Davis Chandler plays a delightful little dirtbag while the heros van Cleef and Tucker all enigmatic and a bit on the shady side seem to have been borrowed from Cinecitta. The excellent music by Dominic Frontiere is also presented in Italian style.".

	schema:reviewBody "Barquero is directed by Gordon Douglas and written by George Schenck. It stars Lee Van Cleef Warren Oates Forrest Tucker Kerwin Matthews and Mariette Hartley. Music is by Dominic Frontiere and cinematography by Gerald Perry Finnerman.When is a Spaghetti Western not a Spaghetti Western? When it's Barquero is the answer. It has the feel of a Pasta Oater from the colour photography and musical scoring to the pungent dialogue delivered in various guises of grizzle and accents Barquero clearly takes its lead from Europe. Which as it happens is absolutely fine because this is a hugely enjoyable exercise.I would give anything in the world to spend the night with you... Except my bargePlot basically involves a cat and mouse scenario played out on each side of a river. On one side is a gang of thieves led by Warren Oates' Jake Remy who after executing a robbery in town are trying to leave the country. On the other side is the townsfolk headed by Cleef's Travis who is the most important man in the play because he owns the ferry barge that is apparently the only means of crossing the band of water.Back east I read books about men taming the wilderness. I dreamed about those men. They weren't like you. They weren't like you they were statues that people could look up to. The only resemblance you bear to a statue is pigeon droppingsWhat unfolds is a twin telling of the character dynamics at work in either side of the camp. Remy is a mercenary bastardo who rules his gang with a rod of aggressive iron Travis is hard bitten by life and actually doesn't care much for the townsfolk he serves. The two men are battling for supremacy not just of the barge situation but of their psychological well beings. Hostage situations come into play there's plenty of scowling at each other across the water some piercing violence and it builds to a grand finale with a battle fit for some viking based epic!Casting aside the cheese laden dialogue and it's best just to run with it to fully enjoy the picture it's a production of some serious quality. With two of the genre's best brooders leading the cast the acting side of things is in good hands. Backing up Cleef and Oates both excellent are Tucker Travis' comic sidekick but still hard as nails and Matthews Remy's voice of reason and although she's under used the adorable Hartley hits the right notes for the key female role that tempts and taunts Travis' core masculinity. The Colorado location photography is gorgeous the beautiful shimmering landscapes alive in De Luxe Color. Frontiere's Hang 'Em HighChisum score is dynamite blending Spaghetti style clangs with military percussion it swells and explodes at all the key points of plotting. Douglas Rio Conchos is unfussy in direction maintaining interest during the talky character expansion scenes. And finally I simply have to mention the sound mix Robert Miller and Ben Sad it's tremendous the thunder of hooves and the crack of gunfire literally splinters the ears joyously so. I viewed this in HD on UK TCM on my home cinema system suffice to say if possible I recommend you see it that way as well!Awash with caricatures and the sort of tongue in cheek scripting that lends it a vibe to not be taken serious it's clearly not a hidden masterpiece but this is fascinatingly muscular fun that also looks and sounds tremendous. 7.510".

	schema:headline " Helluva casting combo with Van Cleef versus Oates but subpar execution";
	schema:reviewBody "Barquero has really no excuse for not living up to its full potential. The inspired casting choice of piting genre stalwarts Lee Van Cleef and Warren Oates in opposite sides of the river against each other and the idea behind the film  a group of ragtag cutthroats led by Oates transporting rifles and silver after a successful raid at a nearby town to the Sonoran territory in Mexico and desperately in need to cross the river before the army gets them while Lee Van Cleef as the boatman holds the barq at the other bank and refuses to pick them up. That should have been enough to keep Barquero afloat and my terrible puns at bay ahem.What really keeps the film down is the unpolished roughly sketched script. The first and closing acts sustain interest through lengthy bouts of gunfighting but some kind of semicompelling plot needs to be assembled for the middle act where sadly Barquero fails to kick the conflict into high gear a hard feat to accomplish with a story that seems to invite conflict and could have gone into so many different places. Instead what we get by the end of act two is the good guys outwitting the bad and saving the hostage Warren Oates was keeping tied up and Oates half mad and desperate as the army draws closer with every passing moment shooting holes at the water and saying to his henchman I shot the river. Not particularly endearing don't you think? Forrest Tucker steals scenes in the role of anteating Mountain Phil while Van Cleef and Oates seem to be representing two different western archetypes  Van Cleef the romantic hero eclipsed by the coming modernization of the west represented in the movie by a bunch of squatters he's called to protect Oates the roughhewn murderous son of a bitch the gritty and hardboiled aspect of the western pioneered at the time by spaghetti westerns of whose villains he's somewhat reminiscent of.Definitely better seventies westerns to keep the genre aficionado occupied out there but it's worth a watch for its marquee value Van Cleef and Oates a dream match made in heaven and both in pretty good shape.".

	schema:headline " AmericanItalianate Western that burns out too soon";
	schema:reviewBody "Finally saw this tonight its been called the most Italianate of American Westerns by some critics more so than Eastwoods contemporary Hang em High and I'll have to admit it really starts off like gangbusters after the unusual opening credits sequence its shot to resemble an oil painting looking as if the film is being projected upon a canvas. Director was Gordon Douglas who did Rio Conchos Chuka Them Robin  The Seven Hoods and In Like Flint to name a few. Its initial first half has a way more SW feel to it than Hang Em' High.Unfortunately what I watched was a fullscreen pan  scan a bit blurry with the colors seeming a bit too strong recorded off a broadcast so it wasn't quite the best way to watch it.It was shot on location in Colorado.We see two groups a small army of mercenary outlaws and a trio riding in opposite directions with a river valley in the b.g. One side of the river leads to the Mexican border.Lee Van Cleef is Travis the Barquero the ferryman and we see him plying his trade as he pulls a wagon of settlers across his only weapons are a bowie knife and some sort of long range rifle of a Sharps or Spencer type. He has one prop from his SW days and that's his Angel Eyes tobacco pipe.We first see Jack Remy Oates in bed with a plump sweaty Hispanic whore Layeta wearing his black hat with a fancy gold hatband in a saloonwhore house the Double Eagle in the town of Buckskin very frontier looking with a lot of log cabin buildings he's looking his sleaziest best. Some sample dialog.Whore fawning am I not beautiful senior? Jack looking disgusted I need a drink. Whore Say it senior. Jack you're beautiful...oh are you beautiful. Whore why do you wear your sombrero? Jack  why do you wear your stockings Whore because they are pretty Jack my hat's prettya bit later the whore is splashing perfume on herself while singing...Whore do I smell senior'? Jack yea you sure do.The massacre of the town starts and Jack is shooting from the windowA Mexican male breaks into Jacks room and asks whats going onJack we're shooting people. and Jack blows him away. Jack to whore you live in a lousy neighborhood you ought to move.Jack is in his command post for the raid on the town by his small army of misfits. Their goal is the bank and a shipment of Winchester Rifles that an army patrol is escorting. Oates' second in command is a Frenchman Marquette Kerwin Matthews. Jack dresses Layeta asks Senior wouldn't it be nice to take Layeta with you Jack no Layeta will I see you again? Jack I don't think so and he shoots her.The action sequences are pretty good throughout the whole massacre. There are some very good character actors Forrest Tucker Mountain Phil  puts in an over the top memorable performance as a mountain man. All I remember of Tucker is his TV F Troop performance but he's a hoot in this flick too.Marie Gomez plays Nola Chiquita from The Professionals she is Travis's woman. Mariette Hartley plays the unfaithful wife of a squatter who offers herself to Travis a type of person she loathes but is attracted too if he'll save her husband he does and she does and Nola doesn't mind.The film looses steam unfortunately once the confrontation becomes a Mexican standoff at the river it even quotes FAFDM with a bit where Jack smokes reefer and has a flashback but it just doesn't work. The flash back recalls how he got his hat not exactly a major plot point and it feels as if it was stuck in there just to be going with the flow of the late 60's early 70's idea of cool. The film had potential but ends up loosing its way and feels more like a TV program at the end. The barge battle was a bit hurried but you have to admit different.The final duel between Travis  Jack is flat has no dramatic build up at all almost as if they ran out of time. Score is nothing special.Van Cleef should have had a bit more screen time he's just not featured enough in my opinion but he is acting in a very different role not a cool efficient killer not and ex outlaw not a drunk more of a pioneering business man. And this come to think of it in hindsight may have been his biggest career screwup he was typecast for years by Hollywood as an outlaw then he got that role of a lifetime as Mortimer he could of or at least his agent could have really tried to do as Eastwood did and parlayed the MWNN character into an American film career if they had held out. If he had played another strong Mortimer type in a successful American film here who knows how far he may have gone. This would have been a great Leone or Corbucci or Sollima film if they had the guts to bring an Italian director over and give him a budget Peckinpah would have been excellent also too bad it was a unique story and they would have made more out of it. This needs a widescreen DVD transfer release please.".

Van Cleef is always watchable although he seems a little uneasy at playing a character that is neither the classic bad guy he was so good at nor a typical good hero. In the hands of another actor it may have looked bland but not with Van Cleef.The film is daring enough to grant equal screen time to its main villain played by Warren Oates who gets one of his very first cinematic leading roles here. Oates is the multilayered Jake Remy colourful bad guy and arguably bettercharacterized by the script than the ferryman Van Cleef. Oates delights in his role in what seems like planned hamminess good thing because the role calls for it coupled with authentic danger and ferocity. Mariette Hartley is beautiful but unnecessary. The climax hurts the film. There's a good chance at the end to choose from two original endings both dying or both getting away but the screenplay takes the clich way and lets Van Cleef shoot Oates in a spiritless thankless twosecond duel.

Lee Van Cleef does a superb job!If you want to watch an oldfashioned shoot'emup with a hero his partner and a whole lot of others thrown in to make it interesting then this is the movie for you.Quite simply put it should be shown on The Western Channel a lot more often  and it should definitely be released on DVD  what are they waiting for? I loved it if only for the fact that it does NOT have gobs of special effects all done with computers!!".

	schema:reviewBody "It's all about the two stars in this Western drama. Lee Van Cleef and Warren Oates square off in this tale about a maniacal bandit named Remy Oates who has his gang stage some wholesale slaughter while they make off with some booty from a robbery. However it's vital that they obtain a barge in order to cross a river and make it to freedom. And the man in charge Travis Van Cleef turns out to be a very cool customer. The balance of Barquero shows what happens as two men engage in a battle of wills.Being a fan of Van Cleef and Oates this viewer would have liked to have enjoyed this a bit more. The problem for him was that the movie ended up overlong and didn't have as much tension as he would have liked. The frighteningly intense action scenes early on seem to be setting us up for something different for several minutes there's a multitude of gunfire and a rather hard edge to the proceedings that may turn some viewers off. Barquero ends up turning into a not uninteresting if plodding character study as we get to see bit by bit the mental deterioration of the Remy character. He clearly wasn't expecting to have such problems trying to secure his transportation.Barquero is a MUST for those who love Van Cleef and Oates though. The two actors are at their best. Van Cleef is as cool as can be and Oates is wonderfully flamboyant. The strong supporting cast includes such familiar faces as fantasy genre star Kerwin Mathews who's damn good as a Frenchman who rides with Remy lovely Mariette Hartley and the entertainingly weaselly John Davis Chandler. It's costar Forrest Tucker however that steals much of the show. He makes the most of his colourful part as Mountain Phil who delights in showing Chandler his idea of fine cuisine.Decent enough guidance by journeyman director Gordon Douglas excellent music by Dominic Frontiere and gorgeous cinematography by Gerald Perry Finnerman help to result in a reasonably rousing show. The unusual action climax makes it worth the wait.Six out of 10.".

An interestingly hearty western that's a little more than your copy and paste genre effort and helping out are the imposing two leads Lee Van Cleef and Warren Oates. Oh they were outstanding adversaries but when it came to shove they were given too little to do as they basically standoff against each other from across a river. Yep that's right. After an earsplitting gunfight to open up proceedings it really does slow up midway and even stalls before reaching a crackerjack climax where Cleef and Oates come to blows. It's all about the slow winding suspense of the morality situation than just cracking out the gritty and bloody violence. The script tends to focus on the struggle for control where it's a game of tug of war to grab the upper hand. Quite a personal angle too with an odd sense of humour. It could've have been more memorable even compelling if it wasn't as wellworn in its occurring developments.A highlight of the feature would be the professional scope of the cinematography as it captured the glittering river and beautiful backdrop. The leering camerawork would focus on the faces and actions just as well. At times it feels like a TV movie but director Gordon Douglas' accessibly tight handling and patient style seemed to be influenced by the material's drawn out structure. The support cast are fine additions with a lively Forrest Tucker giving the best performance.".

But the river stands between the bandits and freedom. And the only way they can escape is on the barge owned by LEE VAN CLIFF. But CLIFF is attached to his barge and wont let go. The villagers led by CLIFF and FORREST TUCKER escape to the other side of the river on the barge leaving the bandits stranded in the village. Tensions run deep in both camps regarding the next plan of action.One of the reasons I bought the Bluray DVD was because the film had LEE VAN CLIFF and WARREN OATES facing off against each other. The muscular and sweaty CLIFF is terrific. I wonder whether the director had a soft corner for him because I'm sure the ladies would find him to be eye candy. WARREN OATES does not make much of an impression  his role is ill etched and he looks way too slight and wiry compared to CLIFF. And the supporting cast is poor  the gorgeous MARIETTE HARTLEY in the role of a posh woman coveted by CLIFF's character is irritating at best the unremarkable MARIE GOMEZ plays CLIFF's girlfriend NOLA JOHN DAVIS CHANDLER is a poor man's Klaus Kinski while the pudgy FORREST TUCKER and his torture of the bandits were a distraction at best. The dialogues and plot developments are uninspired. It could have been a terrific little film. It had so much going for it  the story and the location had a lot of potential. The final action scene was pretty cool. Everything in the film looks very authentic including the sweaty sex scene between OATES and a Mexican prostitute. It is sort of a huge opportunity lost. I guess its too late to wish for a remake. Nobody makes westerns anymore.".

	schema:reviewBody "While there is plenty of Van Cleef time in Barquero and the Warren Oates factor is a plus this talky western borders on boring. Almost the entire film takes place in one location and the script just doesn't make a lot of sense.

As it is with all the shouting back and forth across the river nothing really happens for long stretches. Barquero to me was somewhat of a disappointment and in no way challenges Lee Van Cleef's performance in The Big Gundown or some of his other non Leone westerns.  MERK".

Michael CatonJones is not Paul Verhoeven neither Henry Bean and Leora Barish are Joe Eszterhas. Basic Instinct 2 is just an entertaining average thriller and besides the addition of Jerry Goldsmith original score keeps little resemblance to its predecessor. Even Stone gives her character a different dimension creating a lustful devilish Catherine Trimell who can perfectly well rank among other monsters like Hannibal Lecter. She is an intelligent actress who is not afraid of taking risks and can play with camp at her leisure. Unfortunately she seems to be the main target for those who enjoy trashing this flick. She became too successful too much of a main icon and like all those actors who have reached that level her time has arrived and she is now bound to be destroyed by Hollywood audiences.The rest of the cast is outstanding giving performances that are far better than the material deserves. David Morrissey is a much better actor and by far more interesting than Michael Douglas his acting is flawless giving a dense complex dimension to an otherwise one dimensional character. Since he has more screen time and is the axis of the movie he can keep your attention from beginning to end.I am not recommending Basic Instinct 2 as a great movie I am just expressing my disagreement with most of the comments on this site and my conviction that agendas other than the movie itself are shaping the opinion of most spectators.".

I mean my gosh just because the wide crowd does have to have a victim each year they can pick on not everybody has to join them. So yeaaah maybe those movies aren't perfect but c'mon how many movies are? Not every movie is supposed to be a new The Lord of the Rings! Not everybody will enjoy these movies but I bet there are more than who admit they do. Hudson Hawk 1991 who is just hysterical funny Color of Night 1994 which may not be Oscarworthy but is definitely a not dumb at all thriller with some nice twists Swept Away 2002 which I thought is a great mix of sick humor and a beautiful romance Gigli 2003 which was great entertainment with some really memorable lines and not badly acted at all from the former BenniferCouple and this year it's Basic Instinct 2! Well when I heard the rumors of a sequel to one of my favorite movies I was very sceptically and although I really love Sharon Stone I stayed sceptically until I've finally seen this movie. And really I was very positively surprised! I can't understand why it gets such a bad press and such a bad voting here. It never simply copies the original it has a quite clever story has tension action humor and the absolutely stunning Sharon Stone reprising the role of her life! With 47 years when shooting the movie she looks hotter than many stars in their 20s but it's more than her being beautiful it's brilliantly acted with all her looks her famous smile the way she speaks and moves... from the very first frame she's in you can't take your eyes off of her. It's simply a pleasure to watch her as Catherine Tramell and all of the other actors deliver solid performances too! So I really can't see what's wrong with this movie... it has a dark thrilling sexy and gritty look strong performances and you never felt bored! Maybe the story isn't Oscarcaliber but it never even tries to be! It's an entertainmentmovie and by this standard it absolutely delivers in my opinion! So give it a try!".

	schema:reviewBody "I think the reason for all the opinionated diarrhea on this movie is that most people have it out for Sharon Stone being around 50 and getting naked while playing sexy. No one cared when the Golden Girls sat around eating cheesecake and discussing their first orgasm but to see someone post menopausal getting digitally pleased while driving I guess is just too much for some to handle. Let's face it she looks good she's light years hotter than my mother who's the same age! It's not an Oscar or a cult classic like the first but ever since the turn of the century that's all movie goers seem to expect a cinematic experience that will touch your soul. As such it never claims to be either. It's an erotic thriller that is both erotic and thrilling and is a continuation of a brilliant character that we all love to hate. It's the character of Catherine Trammell that helped give way for this sequel. Fans of the first movie want to see more of that frosty ice queen.The cinematography and art direction were lush and extravagant and made me want to move to Britian for sure. The score is amazing as well.Sure there's some overacting from some characters but there's some brilliant work from David Morrissey who's virtually unknown.There's a setback in that the script is virtually the same as the first movie only plugging in a psychiatrist in place of the cop. As well as the criminal decision of the MPAA to force the movie to be cut down even more which takes away from the guiltypleasure raunchiness that the story is known for.At the very least it's entertaining and fun to look at it and that's the movie's only intentions. So if you've got beef with Mizz Stone maybe you should actually SEE the movie and draw your own conclusions before you spew forth your projectile vomit?".

	onyx:emotionText "I think the reason for all the opinionated diarrhea on this movie is that most people have it out for Sharon Stone being around 50 and getting naked while playing sexy. No one cared when the Golden Girls sat around eating cheesecake and discussing their first orgasm but to see someone post menopausal getting digitally pleased while driving I guess is just too much for some to handle. Let's face it she looks good she's light years hotter than my mother who's the same age! It's not an Oscar or a cult classic like the first but ever since the turn of the century that's all movie goers seem to expect a cinematic experience that will touch your soul.

	schema:reviewBody "Finally after years of awaiting a new film to continue the sexual mayhem of Basic Instinct we have been given a great sequel that is packed with the right elements needed for a franchise such as this! I remember everything about the original the steam the romance the sex the interrogation the music by the master Jerry Goldsmith and everything else from violence and murder to intense confrontations of all kind! Make no mistake Basic Instinct was a real winner for audiences everywhere. I can remember in 2001 when we were first given the news about such a sequel. Five years later we have it. I never would have thought it to end up such as this. When it was declared a dropped project time sure couldn't tell if it was ever a real possibility to begin with. Well I guess we now know anything's possible in this case. Even if the original director or writer are not present all we need is the glamorous always reliable Sharon Stone and we have a done deal! Please hear me out...When people say that this film is bad I think it is only due to the fact that the style is extreme and slightly dated. I use the word dated only because we have not seen a certain film of the like in many years and audiences have become adapted to the pointless boring storytelling seen in other movies that actually make money and the only reason they make such big numbers is because those films are family friendly. Who needs hole some and clean? Of course it's a pleasant thing to have but c'mon! Escapism is really seldom these days and Basic Instinct 2 gives us real fans what we've been expecting. This film is not an Academy Award winner nor does it try to be. It simply delivers the diehard fans what they have been expecting. It's a film for fun. Movies today seem to take themselves way too seriously but this film is just loose and fun not taking itself seriously not too seriously anyway. That said I shall evaluate the film.The film is a fastpaced film from the first second as we see Cathernine Tremell in a car speeding at 110 MPHand enjoying lustful thrills doing so. Perhaps sex and driving does not mix because our sexy novelist takes a bad turn and...well she gets away unharmed but her studly partner doesn't fare too well. Once again Tremell is the primary suspect of the accident and will be put under analyst's and psychiatrists. Dr. Michael Glass Morrissey is automatically drawn to to her from the first moment he meets her. Like another criminal investigator before him he is entranced and seduced slowly and surely. His denial of it all begins to crumble around him as she weaves a spell only she has the power to do. Tramell is possibly more dangerous now than she was beforebut like the first one we'll never really know will we? Once the seduction is in motion jealousy rage drugs and a plateful of erotic scenery ensues!This film does not recycle the first one but rather mentions the previous films incidents briefly from time to time. This is a good thing. It lets us as an audience know that the script has been written to bring the level up a notch or two. Sharon Stone dazzles us again as though 14 years has not come to pass. Her second run of the deceitful novelist is right on the spot as earlier. Just awesome! David Morrissey is well cast and manages pretty well. The fact that a nonpopular star was chosen makes his performance all the more enjoyable because we as an audience have no background on him just what we see him perform. My final thought8.5 to 9 out of 10. So it's not the first one nor can it live up to the first ones prize winning place. It can however live up to the standards set by the first film and it does folks! It does.".

Anyone who says she is horrible in this film must have felt the same in the first one bc she is back acting the same way she did in Basic Instinct 1. Catherine is hers and she plays her to perfection. Her one liners are great much like in the first one. Who can forget in the first film when she tells the cops If you're gonna arrest me do it...otherwise get the fk out of here! Great scene and believe me she does it again in this one. I was captivated by her. Her outfits the way she smoked her cigarettes believe me its worth the price just to see Stone's performance. I cannot wait for this film to be released on DVD uncut because I can only imagine how much better it is going to be. And yes there are lots of twists as in the first one including the ending!".

Thrilling sexy trash but trash nonetheless. It was also a film that tapped into a certain sexual zeitgeist. After a decade of antisex AIDSinduced hysteria a film about a wildlysexual hotbod who thrillkills to heighten her sexual pleasure was pretty enticing stuff. Basic Instinct 2 was always going to struggle to provide the same social relevance and immediacy so the fact that it's desperate attempts at raunchiness are so lame can sortof be overlooked. All it really had to provide was that thin veneer of titillation and a mildly engaging story and all would have been watchable. That it resoundingly fails on so many levels and in such a way to be a career nadir for everyone involved is really quite extraordinary to watch. Let's state the obvious for starters  Sharon Stone is too old for the part of sexual magnet Catherine Trammell. What was so photogenic thru Verhoeven's lens looks like mutton dressed as lamb in the hands of gunforhire Michael CatonJones who's flat drab colours and static camera render her undeniable beauty totally moot. I like Sharon Stone a lot but if the first film launched her career BI2 could kill it. She has no chemistry with stuffedshirt David Morrissey  their only sex scene is embarrassing too watch. His doughfaced mamma's boy of a character made me yearn for the swaggering orangeskin machismo of Michael Douglas. Supporting turns by David Thewlis and Charlotte Rampling waste these fine actors on talky exposition scenes and clichheavy posturing. And what of the muchtouted sexual shenanigans? Poorlylit fleetinglyglimpsed as utterly mainstream as an episode of Desperate Housewives  the European sensibilities that Verhoeven brought to the sexual content of the first film are sorely missed. Don't watch this film for carnal thrills  there are none and what there is is tragic. The film is as a whole convoluted to the point of utter confusion boring and laughable. The last 40 minutes in particular where you come to the realisation that the film is in fact not going to go anywhere of interest at all are particularly gruelling and hilarious in equal measure. As a failed sequel Basic Instinct 2 will come to occupy similar cinematic ground as Exorcist 2 The Heretic Beyond The Poseidon Adventure and XXX2. As a vanity project it rivals Battlefield Earth in its misconception. As a multimillion dollar piece of Hollywood filmmaking it's a travesty that will be hard to top as the years worst.".

The saddest parts are when she tries to be aggressively sexy and says things like I want to beep you  and it looks like let's say it gently a very very mature woman acting rude and not sexy at all. That erotic tension from BI1 is totally gone. From the technical point of Basic Instinct 2 is a mediocre movie  better than typical straight to DVD but on a far lower lever than the original movie. For instance the scene of crazy joyride is done poorly. The director of Basic Instinct 2 is no Paul Verhoeven and it shows. The new composer is no Jerry Goldsmith and its shows. The script is done by people who are no match for Joe Eszterhas. There's no substitute for Michael Douglas in it. The film looks cheap and badly edited at times. I'm sorry but my first thought after I left the theater was Why heaven't they made this movie earlier and with original talents behind the success of the first movie? All to all the original movie is like Citizen Kane compared to this. The first Basic Instinct is a classic and was a kind of breakthru in the popular cinema. It was provoking sexy and controversial. It had the best Sharon Stone's performance in her career. It had this specific Paul Verhoeven's style. Unfortunately Basic Instinct 2 is a unintentionally funny movie badly directed and a sure Razzie Award Winner in many categories. It's a pity that they made this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "It has been over a decade since the original Basic Instinct was released and more resources have came along that provide easy access to information. Have these very resources caused more harm than people realize? Have people become stuck up and overopinionated for their own good? In the recent years it seems to be pointed in that direction some people are dependent on popular belief and with these new resources it can sometimes cause a negative reaction. More on this later right now let's move onto the review.Basic Instinct 2 is the longawaited sequel at least by Sharon Stone of a raunchy classic that was released back in 1992. Sharon Stone reprises her role as Catherine and once again finds herself mixed up in some trouble. After surviving a car crash tragically leaving her momentary lover dead Catherine is put to psychiatric care with one Dr. Michael Glass and is diagnosed with Risk Addiction. After a very intimate session more murders are taking place and Michale starts to gain an obsession over the mightbe murderer. Is she really capable of such unspeakable acts? Is there someone else out there after her? Or are they after him.The plot is very basic indeed if not a little exacerbated by me but the movie really isn't as bad as everyone says it is. The suspense might not be high the sexual tension isn't always there but that doesn't mean the movie isn't interesting. The plot holds it's ground and can keep your attention if you don't try to take it all seriously. Despite what other people might say Sharon Stone steals every scene she is in no matter how over the top it may be. I guess we'll have to wait until the unrated DVD to be released to see all of the goods which may be very shortly from the looks of it.Since the announcement of the movie people have been trashing it before the production even began. Even the negative votes were coming in long before the movie was released which is something IMDb really needs to fix because how can people rate a movie that isn't even released? Most of the trashing is towards Sharon Stone according to some once you hit over 45 you're not allowed to be sexy anymore. The fact is that Sharon Stone still is sexy and she can still deliver the goods she did over a decade ago. So what if she's up there? Let me see you at her age and try to pull off anything she did in this movie.It really seems that this movie didn't have a fighting chance because now it seems to be a popular thing to not give anything a chance. Even when given a chance a hard headed person will still trash something despite them enjoying it. Which is why I gave this movie a 10 it really doesn't deserve it but somebody has to bring some balance to the ever opinionated and biased world.".

She is handled by Scotland yard in this one a far cry from the San Fransisco PD and Detective Nick Curan who is sorely absent. Rather than prance around with her sexuality tugging at the police and seducing them blindly she is more a bully here and she pushes authoritative figures especially Michael Glass the professional assigned to her case into her game this time around.Sharon Stone turns in a mostly witty and sharp no pun intended continuation of Catherine Tramell Complete with incomparable physique sexy sultry voice and some more blonde poison. Her costars however do not measure up.U.K. veteran Charlotte Rampling is the only other cast membercharacter on Stones level. The rest of the cast are like fish out of water. I think it's part of why the film doesn't work. We have very stiff European authoritative figures bent on the unraveling of the case as well they should be except it doesn't feel like Basic Instinct and the good moments that are had are reminders that it might have been better had they stuck with the original idea which was to have been set in NYC.The production design and art direction are diabolical though again no pun intended and it's a scene set greatly if only the expectations were met. Ultimately I feel the writing was the biggest let down. It's as if Leora Barish and Henry Bean didn't know the character of Catherine and thusly could not completely tell her story. Whatever they have for every one else is a more or less lacking shadow of what the original was.Michael CatonJones is okay but this flick released in 2006 looks like EVERY other action thriller from that time period and that's sad. The original was a cut there I go againabove the rest of what was released back in 1992. It had so much style and charisma and even charm mixed with an extremely interwoven and complex even abstract plotstory. This is just a runofthemill follow up sequel that is as bland and boring as every other product that was churned out by studios at the time. It's all in your face at value which is not very high.

No. She also has clearly had plastic surgery on her face and her haircut in this movie is somewhat unappealing. She doesn't look as soft or genuine or innocent as she did in the original  which is sort of the whole point of being an evil seductress and whatnot.The rest of the performances range from bad to terrible  and Michael CatonJones a typically safe director  one who doesn't always do great work but manages to make worthwhile movies has officially delivered his first true turkey a movie so bad people were laughing at certain moments that were intended to be serious.I hear the film went through multiple editing sessions and it's very clear from the start. Nothing makes much sense. The whole plot is a cosmic mess and the ending  oh my! Talk about stupid AND unbelievable. Still predictable though. I saw Gigli I saw Son of the Mask  and although I'm not looking to smear this film I can say with my own authority which you don't have to agree with at all mind you that I prefer both those films over this catastrophic failure.By the way Stone left five minutes before the movie began and people in the theater began throwing things at the screen during a particularly outrageous and insulting scene inside an orgytype nightclub.Basic Instinct 2  basically it stinks too.".

	schema:headline " Amazing Sequel being unfairly bashed!";
	schema:reviewBody "I just saw Basic Instinct 2 again and my opinion of the movie changed. Initially I had a lot of issues with the movie. And then I read all of the negative press and reviews and coupled with the awful box office I really went in a second time with a much dimmer impression. But oddly I very much came to love this sequel. I went back to see it looking through the lens that was created by all of the negative and vicious criticism. I went out of my way to pay attention to why people were saying this was one of the worst movies andor sequels of all times and I was very happy to realize that are all dead wrong. Warning some of this may contain slight spoilers First people are attacking Sharon Stone like she dressed up like the Prophet Mohammedand defecated on the screen. Her interpretation of Catherine is no different than it was in the first movie. She is SUPPOSED to be over the top. They did add a little more sarcasm to her character though but it's because her position in the movie is different. This story definitely told from Catherine's P.O.V. She is purposely being a sarcastic and nasty and blatant about her machinations to see just how stupid these people really are. If you notice it's mostly directed towards Glass. It's a form of antagonizing him and making him angry enough to fight her which is what she wanted. Catherine is much more exacting and evil in this sequel. I really enjoyed how much it fully exploited her character's potential.The screenplay is just as implausible as the first movie. It takes no more leaps in logic that the original. The same goes for the dialog. Actually the dialog is a little more restrained in the second one. Am I the only one who remembers She's evil! She's brilliant!? The acting in this one is also a lot more restrained. Michael Douglas wasn't all that subtle if you remember correctly.The sequel was darker and more focuses on the mind games than the first movie which I prefer.A lot of criticism has been placed on the sex scenes or rather the chopped and butchered ones in the R rated cut. Again I felt the same way the first time I saw the movie. But I was wrong. People are viewing the sex through the lens of the first movie. The first movie's view of sex was very titillating and very much told from a softcoreporncablemale point of view. It was so choreographed and so overdone. It worked brilliantly for the first movie. The sex in the second one is completely different. It's much more realistically done. It is not as staged. Also the sex in the sequel is like the rest of the move dark and violent and disturbing. That doesn't mean that it's not hot it just means that the sex in the sequel is used for a completely purpose. Every sex scene has a very specific purpose and that is control andor manipulation.To be sure the first movie has sequences that can't be beat Johnny's death interrogation scene the club scene but the sequel isn't trying to oneup the first movie. It stands by itself. It's a completely different feel and angle. But the sequel has its own great moments as well the scene where she straddles the chair in his office threesome scene was hot and a great example of her power over him the Jacuzzi Milena's apartment. But especially the ending! It was far much more satisfying than the original. Evil dark and uncompromising the ending was awesome.People are condemning this movie for reasons that go far beyond tastes and preferences. They really seem to be punishing this movie for its existence. They are also not comfortable with a woman being that unapologetic about her sexuality. Also Sharon's age is being repeatedly attacked and used as a negative slant. That's just stupid and indefensible. We should celebrate age and sexuality. Condemning them just shows how ignorant and pathetic the purview of this country has become.I do agree that the timing of the release was very poorly chosen. This just isn't the market for erotic thrillers or for a more serious frank view of sex period. It's a really safe time for movies. No one's really taking chances. And Brokeback Mountain doesn't count! I loved it but it was defiantly very carefully done. It wasn't really all that envelope pushing. The fact that people think the idea of two men falling in love as radical or envelope pushing or new should probably stick their heads back in the sand.If this movie had been released in a less restrictive time it would have done better. It certainly wouldn't have been as vilified as it has been. Further more the MPAA wouldn't have felt the need to cut the thing to all hell. It is an excellent sequel. It deserves far better treatment than it is receiving. It's really a shame actually and it's also very telling of major issues within our overly judgmental and uneducated culture.If for some odd reason Sharon Stone ot some one from her team reads this review I have seen Basic Instinct 2 three times now. The second and third times I saw the movie with two different people and they were totally surprised at how good the movie was and how much they really enjoyed it. They were also equally surprised at how unmerited and how cruel the reception for this movie was. And whatever each of our issues were with the movie we all agreed on one thing  your portrayal of Catherine was everything that we had hoped for and more!".

	onyx:emotionText "I just saw Basic Instinct 2 again and my opinion of the movie changed. Initially I had a lot of issues with the movie. And then I read all of the negative press and reviews and coupled with the awful box office I really went in a second time with a much dimmer impression. But oddly I very much came to love this sequel. I went back to see it looking through the lens that was created by all of the negative and vicious criticism. I went out of my way to pay attention to why people were saying this was one of the worst movies andor sequels of all times and I was very happy to realize that are all dead wrong. Warning some of this may contain slight spoilers First people are attacking Sharon Stone like she dressed up like the Prophet Mohammedand defecated on the screen. Her interpretation of Catherine is no different than it was in the first movie. She is SUPPOSED to be over the top. They did add a little more sarcasm to her character though but it's because her position in the movie is different. This story definitely told from Catherine's P.O.V. She is purposely being a sarcastic and nasty and blatant about her machinations to see just how stupid these people really are. If you notice it's mostly directed towards Glass. It's a form of antagonizing him and making him angry enough to fight her which is what she wanted. Catherine is much more exacting and evil in this sequel. I really enjoyed how much it fully exploited her character's potential.The screenplay is just as implausible as the first movie. It takes no more leaps in logic that the original. The same goes for the dialog. Actually the dialog is a little more restrained in the second one. Am I the only one who remembers She's evil! She's brilliant!? The acting in this one is also a lot more restrained. Michael Douglas wasn't all that subtle if you remember correctly.The sequel was darker and more focuses on the mind games than the first movie which I prefer.A lot of criticism has been placed on the sex scenes or rather the chopped and butchered ones in the R rated cut. Again I felt the same way the first time I saw the movie. But I was wrong. People are viewing the sex through the lens of the first movie. The first movie's view of sex was very titillating and very much told from a softcoreporncablemale point of view. It was so choreographed and so overdone. It worked brilliantly for the first movie. The sex in the second one is completely different. It's much more realistically done. It is not as staged. Also the sex in the sequel is like the rest of the move dark and violent and disturbing. That doesn't mean that it's not hot it just means that the sex in the sequel is used for a completely purpose. Every sex scene has a very specific purpose and that is control andor manipulation.To be sure the first movie has sequences that can't be beat Johnny's death interrogation scene the club scene but the sequel isn't trying to oneup the first movie. It stands by itself. It's a completely different feel and angle. But the sequel has its own great moments as well the scene where she straddles the chair in his office threesome scene was hot and a great example of her power over him the Jacuzzi Milena's apartment. But especially the ending! It was far much more satisfying than the original.

	schema:reviewBody "I saw the original Basic Instinct when I was 13 years old and thought it was absolutely fantastic with a slam bang ending. The sequel Basic Instinct 2 Risk Addiction is surprisingly well done with a lot of plot twists that I would not dare give away. POSSIBLE SPOILERS Sharon Stone gracefully steps back into the shoes of cinema's most notorious female vixen Catherine Tramell. The film opens with a smash and as the result of the death of a sports star Catherine Tramell is once again the prime suspect in a murder. She is as we all know diagnosed with what Dr. Michael Glass calls a 'Risk Addiction' a need to prove to herself and others that she is basically invincible. The story carries out with great dialogue and Catherine speaks as freely as she always has. Like Detective Nick Curran in the original Dr. Glass is entranced in her web of lies and seduction meanwhile taken into the seedy undergrounds of sex and violence. David Morrissey is perfect for this role. Unlike most sequels this manages to be unique rather than attempting to imitate the first film. There are some obvious homages but nothing over the top. Catherine Tramell is brilliant and masters her ways of manipulation stonger than ever. This film helps fans of the original understand her character better. Michael CatonJones Scandal is a man of genius by taking risks and directing something from an old formula and making it fresh again. John Murphy the composer does the film justice by reinventing the Jerry Goldsmith theme from the original which is one of the best scores in Hollywood history. All actors are brilliant and the cinematography is breathtaking. If you liked the original and are willing to see something different than most sequels I urge you to go and see this film. It's one to be experienced on the big screen and sit back and enjoy.".

Sharon Stone is the only really big name in the cast compared to her and Michael Douglas etc in the first part. I also think BI2 would have been better had Sharon Stone been a bit younger but she is still quite stunning in her looks and has only improved concerning her charisma. Her Brate assistants are not so bad either although I would have wanted some bigger names to the cast.I think there are quite good improvements in the basic plot.

	schema:headline " Powerful Collins novel watered down good but lacklustre";
	schema:reviewBody "WARNING there could be SPOILERS ahead it's difficult to make my comments without perhaps giving something away. But I'll try not to!This is a reasonably interesting film that unfortunately suffers from deviating too wildly from the original plot by the Victorian writer Wilkie Collins. To modern audiences this film may seem slow or without much point a shame since the Collins novel it is based on is extremely exciting Collins was an unorthodox writer considered very shocking by many people of his day  far more explicit re. violence and sex than say Dickens.Jared Leto stars as a young and naive aristocrat 'Basil'who suffers from having his friendships and imagination restrained by an overbearing and classconscious father. He longs for excitement. When love arrives he is overwhelmed but learns that passion and duplicity bring suffering and dreadful consequences. Basil will learn that the world and other people are seldom as innocent as they seem. Basil is placed in situations where as the film's jacket says he has literally 'everything to lose'. Claire Forlani plays the woman with whom Basil falls in love. Forlani is a fine actress but unfortunately isn't given much to do here. The luminosity vivaciousness and littlegirl behaviour which makes Basil love her that her character has in Collins's book just isn't there. The remarkable way in which Basil meets her in the novel is completely missing. Christian Slater also appears as Mannion whom Basil befriends but again the film script has entirely altered how he and Basil meet and changes many dynamics of their relationship he becomes Basil's friend rather than an enigma Basil is intrigued with not exactly Collins's intention. The wonderful Derek Jacobi also appears but again isn't given much great material to work with. He remains a very important character but his behaviour and personality also differ from in Collins's 'Basil' some important details are completely changed. Basil's relationship with 'sister' Clara also changes. Watchers could still enjoy this quite thoroughly if they don't previously know the book. Those however who know the book will probably be disappointed. Modern films generally tend to try to intensify the plots of classic novels when they adapt them this film instead dampens Collins's plot. The Collins book is considerably more intense he was one of the best plotters in Victorian fiction and great at character psychology. Clearly the intent here was not a faithful adaptation but I see little reason why the director and screenwriter here didn't keep his major plot points.Those who like this film should perhaps read the book they will then know a far better version of the story especially a far more powerful version of Mannion I thought Slater miscast or his role basically wrecked. Basil is meant to be naive and honest but too often in this film we see him doing or saying things that don't make sense or go too far again deviations yet Leto isn't as intense in his portrayal of Basil as I would like Basil's mental instability is mostly missing still he is easy to like and certainly remarkablelooking. He is the best among the cast the others are not particularly engaging. The scriptwriting and editing as other reviewers noted are not so good but the film looks beautiful and has good locations and period detail. A 6.5 out of 10.".

	onyx:emotionText "WARNING there could be SPOILERS ahead it's difficult to make my comments without perhaps giving something away. But I'll try not to!This is a reasonably interesting film that unfortunately suffers from deviating too wildly from the original plot by the Victorian writer Wilkie Collins. To modern audiences this film may seem slow or without much point a shame since the Collins novel it is based on is extremely exciting Collins was an unorthodox writer considered very shocking by many people of his day  far more explicit re. violence and sex than say Dickens.Jared Leto stars as a young and naive aristocrat 'Basil'who suffers from having his friendships and imagination restrained by an overbearing and classconscious father. He longs for excitement. When love arrives he is overwhelmed but learns that passion and duplicity bring suffering and dreadful consequences. Basil will learn that the world and other people are seldom as innocent as they seem. Basil is placed in situations where as the film's jacket says he has literally 'everything to lose'. Claire Forlani plays the woman with whom Basil falls in love. Forlani is a fine actress but unfortunately isn't given much to do here. The luminosity vivaciousness and littlegirl behaviour which makes Basil love her that her character has in Collins's book just isn't there. The remarkable way in which Basil meets her in the novel is completely missing. Christian Slater also appears as Mannion whom Basil befriends but again the film script has entirely altered how he and Basil meet and changes many dynamics of their relationship he becomes Basil's friend rather than an enigma Basil is intrigued with not exactly Collins's intention. The wonderful Derek Jacobi also appears but again isn't given much great material to work with. He remains a very important character but his behaviour and personality also differ from in Collins's 'Basil' some important details are completely changed. Basil's relationship with 'sister' Clara also changes. Watchers could still enjoy this quite thoroughly if they don't previously know the book. Those however who know the book will probably be disappointed. Modern films generally tend to try to intensify the plots of classic novels when they adapt them this film instead dampens Collins's plot. The Collins book is considerably more intense he was one of the best plotters in Victorian fiction and great at character psychology. Clearly the intent here was not a faithful adaptation but I see little reason why the director and screenwriter here didn't keep his major plot points.Those who like this film should perhaps read the book they will then know a far better version of the story especially a far more powerful version of Mannion I thought Slater miscast or his role basically wrecked.

As a young kid Leto catches his father en flagrato with another woman so when his beloved and sickly mother dies Leto is rather inclined to do like Dad does not like he says.All of which makes him putty in the hands of Christian Slater who has a deep seated hatred for Jacobi and you have to see the film to know what it's about. Content yourselves with what I've already told you Jacobi and you can figure it out. He and his girlfriend Clara Forlani set young Leto up good and proper and he becomes the second son to have been cast from his father and Bonham Carter was similarly thrown out.Like David Copperfield we see the protagonist over the years grow from little kid to full adulthood and like Copperfield Basil gets involved with two women the second being the one that counts in the person of Rachel Pickup a young girl taken in by Jacobi and whom he grew up with. But some truly dark impulses involving sex and infidelity that Dickens would not have explored for a protagonist of one of his novels are present in Basil and in Christian Slater's character of John Mannion.Leto and Slater are present in this British Victorian novel clearly for American box office. Still both do an excellent job with Slater not even attempting a British accent in the tradition of Clark Gable from Mutiny On The Bounty. Basil is not in the league with that MGM classic but it stands well on its own merits.".

The plot twists are quite startling and some aspects of the story don't make that much sense in a but it's a suspenseful and satisfying yarn to watch on screen.The filming is quite well done with atmospheric locations and sets. The cast is interesting with Jared Leto and Christian Slater both playing English characters with accents that aren't quite spot on of course.

These mysteries add up to a story that reveals and creates new puzzles as it advances. I totally recommend it.I'm conscious that I normally give movies and TV series a higher score that the average given by my IMDb mates nevertheless I think that 6.1 is way too low for a movie that has so many aspects well taken care of. Maybe I should give a 9 because its not one of my all time favorites but I decide to give it 10 stars in order to try to compensate that 6.1 that I believe it does not deserve.Thanks for readingDavid del Real.

	schema:reviewBody "Basil based on the Wilkie Collins novel has little of the novel in it. In the novel John Mannion is a man in his forties who is completely calm at all times and intrigues Basil as a mystery. Basil's brother Ralph is an ambassador and quite a playboy. Clara is Basil's younger sister. The Julia character called Margaret in the book is an innocent but spoiled girl. Basil has finished college and is of age. The agreement with Mr. Sherwin is to keep the marriage a secret for a full year. The book is generally regarded as a classic Victorian pot boiler. It may be but I prefer the movie. I like the inclusion of Basil's imaginary masked man stories as a child. In having already exiled Ralph we see clearly what the father will do if he finds out about the relationship between Basil and Julia. Mannion here is a worldly genial friend to Basil introducing him to smoking cigars and talk of sex. He seems to be Basil's salvation. Clara being a child taken in by Basil's parents rather than a sibling seems contrived only for one scene but it doesn't detract that she is not his sister. Basil being only 20 and still at college makes it far more believable that he would not suspect those around him of being anything but honest and honorable. The idea that the relationship must be kept secret for only three months makes the story move along faster and is more believable. The incident Basil sees as a child involving his father makes his Father's talk of family pride ring false. In the book Basil insists that his father is a good man though blatantly classist and cold to his children. In the movie we know that he is not as good as he wants people to think.Basil's having to do manual labor and being shocked at the pittance he gets for it is still a social issue and one Collins did not address. The inclusion of the child shows Basil to be a much more honorable moral and principled man in the end than his father ever was. It's an interesting movie the acting is suited to a Victorian drama and I enjoyed it very much.".

SPOILER What really hacked me off was the simplistic approach to women the blonde women were sacrificing and obedient the dark one were untrustworthy and sluts. I really tried to like this  and wasn't looking for much  but I really couldn't get into it.And the Cinematherapy hosts don't help. They twice misnamed one of the characters. It would be a better show if you actually believed the hosts had seen the film!";

	schema:reviewBody "Minor Spoilers Basil starring Jared Leto and Christian Slater isn't a movie most filmbuffs will recognize. Even fewer people know that it was an adaptation of a nineteenth century novel by English novelist Wilkie Collins which  unlike the vast horde of ignoramuses who also never saw the movie  I happen to have read.So if you're wondering whether I'm gonna be that guy the answer is 'Heck yes' but with a crucial caveat.Most filmmakers tasked with converting a novel from the 1800's to a film palatable to today's viewers take the low road. The easy way out. They Bayize plots modernize characters and in doing so strip the themes entirely. The end result is at best a somewhat decent movie which shares many similarities to an amazing novel but with a lot more zing. Sometimes they just literally throw in explosions or zombies or whatever which if you ask me nobody has might be the better way of going about it. Pride and Prejudice and Zombies at the very least does not purport to be a straight take on Austen nor does it affect any highclass bearing.That isn't what happened with Basil. They either didn't change enough or changed too much without adding anything useful. It's a failure in adaptation since they're taking a novel several hundred pages long and condensing it into ninety minutes. Obviously some fundamental changes are required to trim the fat and focus on the meat of the story. If you don't you end up with the '98 adaptation of Basil a flat obtuse take on nuanced literature whose themes quite frankly didn't have a lot to offer your average 21st century moviegoer in the first place.The eponymous hero is played by Jared Leto of recent undeserved acclaim for his minuscule role in the latest Superhero crapfest Suicide Squad. The first sequence however features Basil's boyhood and a series of traumas brought on by his overbearing aristocratic father. The father's shown browbeating any sign of creativity or independence from Basil culminating when he exiles and disowns Basil's older brother for the crime of loving a woman below his station.The very next scene reveals his hypocrisy and the root of his prejudice yup you guessed it fornicating with one of the serving girls out on the manor grounds.By the time Jared Leto steps into Basil's shoes it's obvious he's on the path to rebellion. A chance meeting with mysterious John Mannion from London Christian Slater kicks Basil's rebellion into full gear. John introduces Basil to a common man's world an experience utterly foreign to the sheltered nobleman which culminates when John introduces Basil to Julia Sherwin Claire Forlani. Despite her cold reception Basil's instantly infatuated by Julia and to add fuel to the narrative fire she's the daughter of a London merchant. Sure her house makes mine look like a refrigerator box in an alleyway but a London merchant is to an aristocrat what Burger King is to a fivestar steakhouse. The forbidden love blossoms over the course of several scenes delving into a world of intrigue and betrayal which Basil's father wouldn't have approved of even if it was all roses and daisies which it's anything but. Julia Sherwin one way or another is bound to be his ruin.Sidenote I racked my brain for a specific example in the above metaphor but I guess I'm just a classless pauper the nicest steakhouse I've ever set foot in was a particularly wellappointed Longhorn with a killer porterhouse. Radha Bharadwaj ambitiously produced wrote and directed Basil and I think it's obvious he was in over his head. They Bayize some of it sure replacing a few of the novel's turning points and climaxes with scenes more likely to appeal to the modern audience who won't settle for anything less than overthetop. But it's not as if Bharadwaj butchered the thing I can't point to any single example so egregious as to claim they've fundamentally irreparably ruined the story.What Basil lacks is depth and nuance. Wilkie Collins worked in the realm of literary prose utilizing a set of authorial tools entirely separate from those in film. It might as well be the difference between a watercolor painting and opera. So much of the nuance of character and story is lost when it's compressed into a film of any length and Bharadwaj's take is continually flat. The relationship between Basil and John Mannion  despite the underrated Slater's noble attempt to carry the weight of the entire film on his shoulders  ends up looking more like a Buddy Movie or Bromance in the first half of the flick abandoning novelBasil's infatuation with a more enigmatic John Mannion.Furthermore Wilkins was a master of the serial and is often cited as singlehandedly inventing the modern detective story. His style is apparent even in a novel as early in his career as Basil relying on chapterbychapter suspense and all the hooks and cliffs you'd expect of his more famous contemporary Dickens. There's nothing about any single scene in Basil's adaptation which hooked me or left me on a cliff it drags ponderously even for a historical drama. The twist is predictable even to someone unfamiliar with the work.I can't call the movie a total fail. Certain audiences would eat it up it would probably do well on Lifetime or Hallmark. But I if you couldn't tell am not the kind of person who'd be caught dead watching anything on Lifetime.So no it's not 'The Hobbit' ugh. Cherished literature hasn't been slaughtered here. It's a decent movie on its own right. The costumes scoring and cinematography are all proficient if not engaging.Yet in the end it's just another middling conversion and that's probably the best I can say of it.".

The result is sometimes rather sanctimonious at others preachy not to mention parsimonious. Wilkie Collins embarked on such ideas and found fame with his two most wellknown novels  Moonstone' and The Lady in White'. However his themes suffer from certain overladen stylism absent from novels by his very good friend Charles Dickens. Thus any serious attempt at transposing such works to the screen is bound to bump into all kinds of problems however Radha Bharadwaj resolves most of them with a certain degree of panache such that the end result in this film is more or less acceptable. There is that sense of proprietary so correct to the times in question which pervades the essence of capturing those times of social inequality rule by power the burgeoning heavy hand of the upperclass bourgoisie the Indiarich dwellers of mansions in London and the farflung provincial counties. But it must be said Wilkie Collins drove himself to his own despair and this is clearly shown in his novels though not so clearly perceived in this film. He tried the Russian technique thus missing out on the Dickensian style  much more to the point  incorporating ideas which could only come to fruition a little later by such novelists as Joseph Conrad. If you like he was the masculine equivalent of Virginia Woolf who also drove herself to despair and attempted suicide. But do not compare this film with the recent The Hours' q.v. nor even with The Portrait of a Lady' q.v. Jane Campion's exquisite film based on the novel by Henry James.Notwithstanding how good that word sounds in Dickens' novels! the film has its interest not necessarily because either Christian Slater or Jared Leto have anything special to offer on which to comment as they are both merely acceptable nor for Claire Forlani's part nor for yet another appearance by yet another member of the BonhamCarter family  in this case Crispin cousin to Helena. The film stands up for its merits as a carefully directed and produced period piece which is nicely photographed within and without London. How much of the film is made in Cornwall or even Yorkshire will have to be guessed.An interesting film for its storyline with not much real tangible evidence as to the Victorian scene but which worked hard to transport the book to visual contemplation.".

	schema:reviewBody "Frank Hennenlotter's Basket Case highlights the problem with horror films of today. Back in the eighties films would be made with an idea and no budget and the result would nearly always see the release of an inventive and interesting horror film. Basket Case is no exception to this as despite hokey effects a rather silly story and some very suspect acting Basket Case is a trash classic all the way and it's a film that's guaranteed to delight fans of horror. The story capitalises on the fact that many people including yours truly find the subject of deformity uncomfortable and the subject of living with it even more so. The plot follows a strange young man that carries a basket around with him. Inside the basket lies his hideously deformed Siamese twin and the deformity wants it's revenge! This leads the two brothers to seek out the doctors that separated them and brutally butcher them and delivering us with a great camp horror movie! The central creature  namely the deformed brother is a masterpiece of creature design. The thing itself looks ridiculous but in spite of this it actually manages to be quite frightening and once you've gotten over the initial giggles it takes on a life of it's own and even manages to become quite believable. The film is sufficiently gory which will no doubt be good news for everyone that wants to see it. Frank Hennenlotter is one of those directors that obviously has talent and flair for making films but also hasn't been given a real chance to realise it. It's a massive shame that the endless amounts of remakes continue to get released on huge budgets while someone that could make a great movie is blessed only with chicken feed to make them with. Just wait until the part where the brothers' story is told  that's inventiveness for you! One thing I do love about the director is the way he casts his lead the one here is certainly odd enough in a naive loser sort of a way. On the whole fans of intricate deep cinema should stay well clear  while everyone else is preparing themselves for a damn good time!".

I now realize it was meant to be funny in many places it gets more campy with every viewing that's not bad and the overthetop gore effects help it hold that position. Like the title of this review says you seriously might think of steering clear of New York City after watching this movie. The only two movies I can think of that make New York look like a filthy dirty abyss would be the ones mentioned in the other reviews TAXI DRIVER and HARDCORE. To rebutt a fellow reviewer's point Casey the prostitute is not hairy but is on the chunky side! This movie is highly recommended as campy viewing at best.

	schema:reviewBody "It's rare to see a horror film that is actually good featuring an original premise and decent actingplot.  Some films should have been classics because they feature both but are mocked years later for their horrible special effects think about it  most classic horror films feature human or humanlike villains e.g. slasher flicks and Rosemary's Baby.  Well Basket Case is no exception.The premise is one of the most original then and probably still now.  Duane carries his brother Belial around in a basket and the two are trying to find and murder the doctors who separated them.  It reminds one of Freaks with the deformed Belial and his brother Duane as antiheros of sorts getting revenge on the normal people that treated them so cruelly.  A flashback to Duane's and Belial's separation and events in the film actually made me feel sorry for both Duane because Belial won't let him have any time or romance for himself and Belial because everyone is deathly afraid of him but his brother.For a low budget '80s flick Belial actually looks really good for the most part though the first few deaths in the movie where he remains invisible are still more effective.  When Belial jumps at some people it looks sort of funny but when he is stationary must've been a better puppet he looks either frightened or damned frightening.  Belial also makes some thankfully short appearances as a decent stopmotion animation.It should also be noted that the lower quality grainy film stock does add to the seediness of the film and its badsideofNew York setting to give it a more creepy and realistic quality.  There's a fairly high amount of gore and the events leading up to the ending are eerie and shocking it should be noted that though it has some weak comedic aspects this film isn't the intended horrorcomedy its sequels are.  Some of the acting isn't the greatest but that's to be expected.  After all this is a horror film and after all it's low budget.  Knowing that just makes this film seem all the more classic.".

'Basket Case' was one of THE great late 70searly 80s low and I mean looooow! budget horror movies linked in my mind with such genre classics as 'Phantasm' and 'Evil Dead'. Watching it now I don't think it's QUITE as great as those two but it's still enjoyable to watch and along with 'ReAnimator' 'Motel Hell' and 'Dead And Buried' it's one of the essential horror movies of the 1980s. Look it isn't perfect the animation sequences in particular are pretty poor but considering the lack of funds it's creepy bizarre and doesn't take itself very seriously and Kevin VanHentenryck Duane actually gives a very good performance. Writerdirector Frank Henelotter went on to make the even better 'Brain Damage' and 'Frankenhooker' as well as two sequels which I haven't seen but sadly hasn't made a movie in the last ten years. Henelotter mixes horror and comedy as good as if not better than vintage Sam Raimi and Stuart Gordon in my opinion. Why isn't he making movies?! Why doesn't SOMEONE give him a million dollars and freedom to make anything he wants?? I really really hope he makes a comeback soon. Until then check out 'Basket Case' it's cheap nasty and LOTS of fun!".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is a classic. That's all there is to it. You need to watch it. You need to go watch it now. If you don't know what it's about protect your innocence get a bunch of friends and a bottle of the poison of your choice and gather round the old boob tube. You won't be sorry. SPOILERS... Okay if you've already seen the movie or already know what it's about we can talk about it. If you don't know what it's about I warned you and you're only hurting yourself. But you'll live. The movie concerns the case of Duane and Belial Siamese twins who were separated at what looks like the age of 14 or something. Belial looks like a head with a small monstrous hand and a larger arm. They put the picture of him on the DVD box which annoyed me because if you're seeing this for the first time it's great not to know what he looks like. When they were separating them one of the doctors said of Belial that I'm not sure it's even human and you can tell from his reaction that he is just so so hurt. You know people shouldn't say hurtful things. As the doctors find out when the infuriated headhand thing hunts them down and brutally murders them one by one. One of the best things of the movie is the Hotel Broslin and its residents. This is the cheap Times Square hotel that Duane takes up in while he tries to locate the doctors who operated on him in his own home don't you know. The hotel features a number of wild characters who don't seem that far off from who you'd find living in a seedy Times Square hotel circa 1982. First there's Josephine who meets Duane in the hallway and starts yakking his ear off with this bizarre story then SUDDENLY turns and walks away. Then this Patti LaBellelooking clone invites herself into his room to look around and make passes. She later has a notable quote with I've got some heavy boozing to do. There's also the owner of the hotel and some of its other residents and let's not forget the drug dealer who lists off every possible drug known to man as Duane walks along ignoring him until he finally gives up and says what is wrong with you man? What I love about the first third of this movie is that nearly every character introduces themselves with an extended soliloquy. These folks had to learn some lines for this! And then there's Duane! This movie is CLEARLY on the cusp of the 80s as Duane's hair is this sort of Rick Springfield thing just really huge and lumpy. He has a long scene where he is required to whip out the acting chops whether he does or not I won't reveal in supposedly having a psychic conversation with his headarm former twin. I also love the scene where Duane has bought a TV for Belial to watch while Duane goes out on his date. In his haste to get rid of his brother and leave Duane turns it on to a channel showing nothing but static and just takes off. Oh did I mention the head thing is psychic? And let us not forget the splendorof Sharon the receptionist. Sharon is a desperate New York woman in the Miss Piggy mold with this obvious wig and slightly clunky body and she is a HOOT and 910s of another hoot throughout! The way she just throws herself at Duane is amazing as is the sudden affection she develops for him talking about how she feels so much for him after they met once in passing in a doctor's office! And then there's the scene in which he tosses a blanket over her head and THROWS her out of his hotel room and she's pounding on the door wanting to talk it all out and work on their relationship as she's hearing insane animalistic shrieks emanating from the room where she thought her boyfriend was alone! You know you just shouldn't give up on love. Some things take time to work out. How do you keep the music playing? She also has a notable delivery of Take me Duane as he's about to make love to her. And let me tell you one look at Duane ain't nobody asking him to take them unless it's to take them a six pack back from the corner bodega. There is SOME kind of sexual subtext going on here but I'm not sure it holds together well enough to really examine. If I had to guess I would say that Belial represents Duane's penisisn't it always the penis? and the whole thing is about masturbation. I guess this because he shares a bond with it but others are telling him it's disgusting and eventually separate him from it. Then he starts to develop a relationship with a woman wherein he might have actual sex and Belial freaks out. This would also make a funny pun out of the title. There is a shot at the end that is unmistakably Belialaspenis but overall the story just doesn't hold together well enough to come out with a consistent argument. Ah well. Regardless this movie is in the top ten total hoots of all time. Hey there are lot of other reviews of bad and cheesy movies on my website Cinema de Merde which you can find through the URL in my email address.".

The way she just throws herself at Duane is amazing as is the sudden affection she develops for him talking about how she feels so much for him after they met once in passing in a doctor's office! And then there's the scene in which he tosses a blanket over her head and THROWS her out of his hotel room and she's pounding on the door wanting to talk it all out and work on their relationship as she's hearing insane animalistic shrieks emanating from the room where she thought her boyfriend was alone! You know you just shouldn't give up on love. Some things take time to work out. How do you keep the music playing? She also has a notable delivery of Take me Duane as he's about to make love to her. And let me tell you one look at Duane ain't nobody asking him to take them unless it's to take them a six pack back from the corner bodega. There is SOME kind of sexual subtext going on here but I'm not sure it holds together well enough to really examine. If I had to guess I would say that Belial represents Duane's penisisn't it always the penis? and the whole thing is about masturbation. I guess this because he shares a bond with it but others are telling him it's disgusting and eventually separate him from it. Then he starts to develop a relationship with a woman wherein he might have actual sex and Belial freaks out. This would also make a funny pun out of the title. There is a shot at the end that is unmistakably Belialaspenis but overall the story just doesn't hold together well enough to come out with a consistent argument. Ah well. Regardless this movie is in the top ten total hoots of all time. Hey there are lot of other reviews of bad and cheesy movies on my website Cinema de Merde which you can find through the URL in my email address.";

	schema:reviewBody "After first glancing at the article of this movie in the book Cult Movies 2 some 25 years ago I finally watched Basket Case today having bought the VHS from a used video store about a month ago. It concerns conjoined twins Duane Keven Van Hentenryck and Belial which is a mixture of a puppet and stopmotion animation and their revenge against the doctors that tore them apart. There's also a romance between Duane and one of the doctors' receptionist Sharon Terri Susan Smith. Written and directed by Frank Henenlotter Basket Case is obviously lowbudget and amateurish with cheesy moments to spare especially whenever Belial attacks someone. But it can also provide some genuine scares and shocks especially when Belial encounters Sharon. So on that note Basket Case comes highly recommended. P.S. One of the players a Dorothy Strongin who played Josephine here died in my current hometown of Baton Rouge LA on May 25 2006.".

	schema:reviewBody "SpoilerBasket Case is a grotesque classic from director Frank Henenlotter. It's the fairy tale story of two brothers separated at age twelve literally. You see Duane and Belial Bradley are as close as two brothers can get they're Siamese twins. But they're not quite identical. Belial is an angry little mutant while Duane is a regular looking kid except for the mutant protruding from his side. Their father hires a team of doctors to perform an operation to separate the brothers hoping that Belial will die in the process. But the surgery only makes matters worse now Belial is free to wreak havoc. Years later the Bradley brothers travel to New York to find the doctors responsible...and rip their faces off. Basket Case scores with originality. This plot concept has not been attempted before or after this movie. It's a fairly simple story of revenge. One brother is carrying the other around New York in a large wicker basket to find the doctors who separated them. That's the main idea. But there's more here than just revenge. There's a love story. Yes I said a love story. But there's hate too. And that hatred could tear the brothers apart. The film has a dirty grainy quality that is highly reminiscent of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. In fact everything about this movie is dirty from the seedy Hotel Broslin to the streets of New York at night. It proves that you can do a lot with a little budget you can tear people's faces off create a gruesome stopmotion freak and spawn two sequels. There are some things I didn't like though. The acting for example. I can honestly say that no real actors were used in filming except the cop he seemed believable. Most of the people in the film are just plain CRAZY. Kevin VanHentenryck boy what a name stars as our hero Duane Bradley. He's subpar yet believable in the role. He did do full frontal though so maybe that's how he got the part. I thought the scenes of Duane running nude through the city streets were totally unnecessary. For the ladies I suppose. The rest of the cast seems like people they found on the streets. While they're not classically trained actors and actresses they do fit with the realism of movie. I still enjoy the film's savageness and think it's a great addition to the horror genre. If you don't like Basket Case don't give up on old Frank. Check out his movie Brain Damage and watch for the man with the wicker basket.".

And they always say Huh?Basket Case is I think the greatest independent movie ever made and perhaps the last great midnight movie.  Originally produced as a quick 42nd street horror cheapie it is actually a very thoughtful well done poignant and indeed tragic film.  Watch how brilliantly Henenlotter lays the movie out to the viewer right from the start.  A man in upstate New York is stalked and killed by...something something we don't see something horrible.  Blood sprays on a manila file during the murder this manila file being very important.  Already the audience is engaged.  Who was this man? Why was he killed?  What killed him?  And Henenlotter using the blood spray to not only reveal but also help the audience remember the the folder later in the film is a bit of pure genius.  The film just rolls along from there like gangbusters as we cut to New York's Times Square via 1980 in all its filthcoated glory where we meet Duane Bradley Kevin VanHentenryck as he takes a room at the Hotel Broslin and acts very shady about the large basket he is carrying.  In room 7 he settles in and we see once again the blood splattered folder as well as Duane drop about a dozen hamburgers into the basket from which ravenous chomping sounds emit.  Again Henenlotter is keeping the audience on their collective toes.  Who is this kid?  What is his relationship to the murder?  And most importantly what's in the basket and what is his relationship to that?  I don't want to give anything else away even though most of you probably already know the story but for those who know nothing about the film the storytelling is a true twisty treat and Henenlotter's directorial style is very quirky and unique.I can vividly remember seeing this movie when I was a wee lad very late on USA Up All Night way back when Gilbert Gottfried was hosting and even when it was edited horribly I was still absolutely spellbound by it and immediately went out and bought it.  I was a twisted little kid I guess. It stayed with me throughout the years and is still a movie I watch annually.  It's a total cult movie lovers dream complete with wild gore whacked out characters great overacting scenes that are simultaniously funny and scary a wonderful setting in the scummier corners of New York but with the tourist stuff thrown in too hey dig the Twin Towers in that one establishing shot even jumpy stopmotion animation that Henenlotter has said is something like Gumby on acid.  I see something new in it every time and it hasn't lost a gram of it's power.At heart Basket Case is really a story about brotherly love and all the complications that go with it loyalty jealousy betrayal.  A sort of sicko comingofage film about growing up and moving on and how thats not always so easy for some.  It all builds up to a genuinely tragic and yes even moving ending well I was moved.  Henenlotter against all odds really gets you to care to care about Duane and that little inarticulate piece of rubber known as Belial.Something Weird Video released a DVD of this movie a year or two ago with a bunch of cool extras and a brand new transfer that made me appreciate the film even more.  For years I had been watching a crappy video of the film that was incredibly dark and muted.  I never knew what I was missing because I just thought this was how the film was shot but no it was a bad transfer of the film.  The new transfer of the film looks amazing showing Henenlotter had better mastery of the camera in this film than previously thought.  It's sharp and crisp and the colors are vivid and rich.  If you see this film I strongly advise you seek out the DVD for full enjoymentappreciation.Basically I really love this movie.  I could go on about it for days and dissect it shot by shot and I sort of feel like I already have.  Go out and see it right now.  I also strongly recommend Henenlotter's other films the Basket Case sequels especially part 2 Frankenhooker his flatout funniest film and Brain Damage his most thoughtprovoking film. Viva Belial!".

It's very remarkable what this guy pulled of with almost no budget. He's the living proof that you only need a dose of healthy creativity and a good basic idea to make an important movie.

Even the main character  I don't know him but his name sounds like he has Dutch roots  is a very bad actor but they're all trying very hard. The creature effects are amazingly cheap and cheesy but at the same time entertaining and they make you wish Hennenlotter had more money. He spent most of his budget to fake blood so therefore the killing scenes are nasty gore and even a bit disgusting. Just how a true culthorror fan likes them in other words.But like I said before it is the story that fascinates you the most. About a boy who takes a basket case with him everywhere he goes. It contains his horrible deformed twin brother. They were Siamese Twins but it  which is called Belial  only exists of a head claws and some other flesh. They were separated when they were young and Belial now wants to avenge that. All persons who were involved in the operation have to die. At the same time Belial is very jealous whenever his brother makes contact with girls and he develops his own sexual feelings Director Frank Hennenlotter made two sequels to this one  which I haven't seen unfortunately  and two other very good titles. Brain Damage and Frankenhooker. Basket Case is without a doubt the best one and at the same time an important film for the genre. The idea of a Siamese Twin is just brilliant in my opinion. I would love to see what this director is capable of when he can use a bigger budget. The creativity he used here sure was promising but he seemed to have stopped filmmaking since the early 90's. Highly recommended if you ain't easily disgusted. A must see for fans of cult and milestones as well !".

I would love to see what this director is capable of when he can use a bigger budget. The creativity he used here sure was promising but he seemed to have stopped filmmaking since the early 90's. Highly recommended if you ain't easily disgusted. A must see for fans of cult and milestones as well !";

They embark on a journey to kill all of the doctors that were responsible for their operation of being cut apart. And they do seek revenge. There is no actor for the part of Belial it was a puppet much of what the NERD character used to be made from don't mistake me though it looked real. And when Belial goes crazy in one scene they use believable stopanimation claymation that looks great. This movie is under some circumstances believable. The hotel that they stay in is so REAL that if you think about it hard enough you can actually smell the grime and dirt on the walls. I took a real chance of getting this movie not knowing anything about it but what I read on the net. But believe me it is a worthwhile movie to buy or rent. Hopefully this can help you out to determine whether or not to see it. But I highly recommend it being such a wonderful movie and all.".

	schema:reviewBody ".....right up there with Evil Dead and The ReAnimator however...With Basket Case what you have here is a lowbudget horror film that has an utterly fantastic plot but unfortunately was made with only a passably mediocre level of execution. Also the fact that it was made back in the early 80's on a slim budget does much in explaining why virtually every frame of it looks painfully dated. However shortcomings aside the films strongest attribute would undoubtedly have to be it's diabolical devious plot which is simply wicked as hell to the core. At the same time I can't help but think how great Basket Case and all the wickedly twisted material that comes along with it could have been in more capable hands  it could have been taken to the next level. For instance who knows how great this could have been if Sam Raimi had directed it. One wonders... but regardless of that Basket Case certainly has it's moments of brilliance be sure of that a few of which are simply enthralling  in a corny lowbudget kind of way of course.The movies plot is one that circles around revenge but it's really more than that as you'll see throughout it's twisted 90 minute duration starting off with murder things are quite offthewall from the get go. Basket Case offers us many different colorful moods and moments such as looselipped drunkenness serial killings telepathic interplay voyeurism dream perversions etc. and yet unfortunately that also causes the movie to be inconsistent and vary drastically in it's ability to entertainment  which is bound to frustrate some viewers. All this results in a film that's as uneven as it is singularly unusual in other words when Basket Case is at it's best it's thrilling however when not thrilling it can and does get quite boring at times and even downright irritating. Note the amount of shrill screaming heard throughout the film. It's a lot even for a horror film. But when looking at the whole picture the good usually prevails over the bad the bad such as Kevin Van Hentenryck's hilariously bad hair. Is that a dead woodchuck on top of his head or what?! Being as specific about it as I can without giving away spoilers I think most will agree that the movie is at it's best during the revenge killing sequences where you get to see the basket case itself in it's full and gruesome glory. Which brings us to the effects. The effects that were used to bring the monstrosity to life sure couldn't have cost much and are primitive at best but at the same time are pretty effective especially the closeups of it's face which are punctuated by a series of funny moans and a few screams. Not to mention the film has a few wonderfully corny stopmotion sequences to enjoy those are certainly good for a chuckle. But beyond that... well let's just say the effectsbudget sputter's out pretty quickly after that. Oh yeah keep a heads up for the scene when it evades detection by hiding in the toilet when the police are in the room scanning for clues. Wait for that toilet seat to rise now THAT'S quality schlock AND comedy gold!All in all Basket Case is a lot of fun some scenes especially just don't expect it to ever rise above anything other then what it is a cheap and corny horror film from the early 80's.Lastly if Basket Case doesn't tantalize you then perhaps it's two sequels from the early 90's will.".

This is the first film of his and the first chapter in the Basket Case series. I never knew about this horror film series until 2013. At that time I wasn't really looking into recommendations on the net and I wasn't even active on social media. My Dad was the man who would recommend movies to me. He was a massive horror fan and would always go to cinemas and check movies out of video stores back in the '80s. Then one day back in 2013 he told me Son you don't know sht about horror until you have seen what I've seen. I asked him Dad what awesome horror films have I missed out on from the 70s and 80s? He gave me a huge and I mean massive list which just goes on and on. I had to write all of them in a book. The first one he told me to look for was Basket Case. I said Dad what's that? He told me Just get it and you'll see. It's one of the best films I have ever seen son. So I found it online and got it along with its sequels. When I saw this for the first time I was like Wow Dad no joke this movie is just filled with horrifying bizarre blood gushing sleazy screaming fun until the end. It's one hell of an entertaining film. Kevin was so damn incredible on screen he was excellent. With Terri Susan Smith Beverly Bonner and others. They were all perfect. Frank Henenlotter did an awesome job. I watched it over again with my Dad. This movie is special to me because this was his last horror film and I hadn't seen it since my dad passed until today. It brought back great memories. And every horror fan should own this movie including its sequels on home video. It's a masterpiece truly a gem!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "of Jean Michel Basquiat and the art world of the 80's. Granted the film is a bit abstruse and some viewers have complained about the music tracks actually Basquiat's own music from his band but it does serve to show the disaffected life of an artist who seemed to gain fame money and fairweather friends despite himself.Jeffrey Wright is very understated but believable as Basquiat. Apparently he and his father were estranged until he became famous. Then everyone wanted something from him. Not just another story of fame and its vices however because the film does NOT show his life as glamorous indeed once he has made it we still see him dining at Lutece people critiquing being unaccepting of him as a person. Perhaps in real life this was one of the sources of his insecurities and reason for his drug addiction. Certainly if one believes even half of what is written about the NY art world it cannot have been a forgiving place.That aside the film also has some interesting cameos David Bowie as Warhol is excellent Dennis Hopper as the Zurich art dealer Bruno Bischofsburger is very believable. An amusing cameo with Christopher Walken as a James Lipton character a pretentious interviewer. The only annoying performance was Parker Posey as gallery owner Mary Boone who perhaps portrayed this person too close to the mark.Keeping in mind that Basquiat was under age 30 when he died this story is credible. An artist who rose too fast was used and discarded apparently in real life Basquiat had a tendency to be generous and gave away many of his paintings. There is one scene where he is beaten up so two street people can take steal a SAMO inscription on a piece of metal.The visuals are also noteworthy while an earlier review critiqued the surfboarding sequence I find that a preferable segue to Basquiat's need to escape apparently he owned a good deal of property in Hawai'i and spent time there as well.The scenes with Claire Forlani are also effective Basquiat's sometime girlfriend we see her as a waitress then a junkie then a cleanedup version going to Columbia. The NY street sequences are realistic It is not glamorous though the accompanying jazz music is. It shows the schizophrenic nature of NY Lutece a homeless person sleeping outside a man selling stuffed animals on the street and Bruno BischofsbergerHopper who mistakes Basquiat for a homeless person trying to clean the windows on his Mercedes. Very realistic.I highly recommend this film it does not glamorize the story and while it may not be completely accurate it rings true and portrays a life many artists may wish for until they get it. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "I thoroughly enjoyed the movie 'Basquiat'. It is a subtle portrayal of a complex character beautifully acted by Jeffrey Wright. It would have been easy for the filmmakers to go over board with this movie. Basquiat sure did have the character to allow that. And the fact they didn't feel the need to do that is why I like this movie so much. It'd been easy to concentrate more on the drug taking on his immense paranoia and on his lively lifestyle that went beyond Andy Warhol and Madonna. And doing that would have probably got the movie more hype attention and plaudits. Instead the makers of this movie just give glimpses of his life and merely suggest a whole lot more and this works well. It's a movie that goes along more at a stroll than a run and grows in stature and depth as it does so.But the 'problem' if you can call it that with 'Basquiat' is that you need to know this man's art and this man's character to really enjoy and appreciate this movie. And that's why I think it maybe doesn't get the sympathetic reviews or attention it deserves. If you didn't know about this man's life before seeing the movie then I don't know what you could take from the film.  And if you watch it without knowing about him and his art then I can imagine it wouldn't really hit the mark.What makes this movie beautiful in it's subtlety is that it does great justice to the wonderful talent and nature of Jean Michel Basquiat. And if you love his art then do watch this movie it's well worth it.910".

	schema:reviewBody "Basquiat is a film with an agenda. Far from being a neutral stage upon which the life and emotion of the artist is played out for us to observe this film wants to make a point about the art world casting Basquiat as Oliver Twist. If you are looking to find out what drives an artist you are not going to find it here  unless the answer is money. The filmmakers did not go very far into the head of their subject  either that or he was a very shallow and vapid person. I did not get the feeling from this film that Basquiat was a true artist rather he came off as an opportunist who figured out how to capture the mechanics of bad abstract impressionism and pass himself off as one. Then a lucky break combined with silly art collectors who have way too much money and not enough of their own thought processes multiplied by a guilt ridden population of white people flush with 1980's cash combine to equal the phenomenon of Basquiat.I am not saying that this is or is not the truth. In the world of art there are no truths anyway. What I am saying is that this is not a neutral biography. It may pay to do a little bit of research into Basquiat before watching the film. As for myself I admit to watching it only because I was bored and nothing else was on. I knew vaguely the story and who Basquiat was but had no opinions of and no real knowledge about him. Since I am not the type of person who forms his opinions on any subject based on information from only one source I did some research into Basquiat after the film before coming to any sort of conclusions. What those conclusions were are irrelevant as far as this review is concerned  but what does concern me are the many people who undoubtedly had their opinion about Basquiat fed to them by this film and who now consider themselves educated on the subject.As far as the film itself it is not bad. Not great but not bad. It had a certain feeling to it. But it is hard to get beyond its portrayal of the subject as he is the reason for the film. As noted Basquiat comes off as an empty headed and shallow individual without a lot of talent or original thought who likes to use drugs and drink a lot. The film's Basquiat seemed not to care much about art that it was an afterthought to him. He was shown as a dabbler  dabbling in music too but not doing much or giving it much effort. Perhaps that is the truth I don't know because overall the film is more a study of art and what constitutes it and gives it value than a biography of an artist  and postulates that today's art is more about the name than the actual piece. The same thing that is given away for free by a homeless man who lives in a box can be worth six figures if the right people decide that it should. I also felt that he filmmakers relied on clich' a bit too much for my liking. The scene that sticks out in my mind is the one where Basquiat was on a schoolyard basketball court with his buddy who was trying to get him to play. Basquiat was totally inept at the game and had no desire to play whatsoever. The filmmakers were obviously trying to demonstrate either one or both of two things  that Basquiat was so much of a cerebral artist that he was incapable of physical sport or that Basquiat was a black man who could not play basketball. Whatever the case the scene was painful to watch. It was hamfisted imagery at its worst. A well done scene with some good conversation and emotion could have sent the same message intended in the schoolyard  actually could have done it better because as blockheaded as the schoolyard scene was it still did not send a clear and defined message.The acting in Basquiat was for the most part serviceable with David Bowie turning in the most inspired performance as Andy Warhol. Bowie brought a subtle warmth and humanity to a person who is often portrayed as a cold cartoon character. Although Warhol was clearly intended to be an exploiter in the film Bowie managed to show him as a person who felt that Basquiat was a true friend and not just a paycheck. This is an Andy Warhol who cared about people and who could have his feelings hurt just like anyone else. This is not the stereotypical movie Warhol playing with people like the proverbial chess pieces. This Warhol genuinely admired the work of his protgs. And David Bowie would know wouldn't he? He was there. I got the feeling that Bowie took the part to make a statement about Warhol  as if he was annoyed by younger filmmakers using the stereotypical Warhol image in an exploitative way. I felt that he was subversively reading the lines between the lines. Good for him.This film is more a commentary on the art world on racism and on exploitation than it is a biography. I would say that it is better to look at it this way for as a biography it is biased and somewhat meanspirited. Remember the first line of this review? It seemed to me that the filmmakers were saying that Basquiat was bereft of talent and inspiration  that he was a bum and a drug abuser who got lucky. Perhaps he was but I'd prefer to make up my own mind. So it would pay to know a bit about the subject before watching  this Basquiat is a light dessert not the main course.".

No matter whether or not you likeliked Basquiat's art this movie is amazing.  In fact you'll probably enjoy the movie more if you don't like his art.  Basquiat was a crackhead who chose to live on the street.  None of his art demonstrated amazing artistic technique yet with the help of some exorbitantly rich twisted and influential people in the art world he rose from the gutter and gained international stardom.  Whether he deserved his fame wealth and glory is addressed throughout the film but the movie is more about how his selfdestructive tendencies managed to get the better of him and lead him to an early death.  The movie is very depressing but also inspiring.  The acting is fantastic overall although Dennis Hopper was awful as Bruno and I wish that Courtney Love were not cast as Big Pink.  The film itself is even a work of art.  Don't see it if you're only into mystery horror suspense or action films but if you like art or are at all intellectual see it see it see it see it see it!".

No matter whether or not you likeliked Basquiat's art this movie is amazing.  In fact you'll probably enjoy the movie more if you don't like his art.  Basquiat was a crackhead who chose to live on the street.  None of his art demonstrated amazing artistic technique yet with the help of some exorbitantly rich twisted and influential people in the art world he rose from the gutter and gained international stardom.  Whether he deserved his fame wealth and glory is addressed throughout the film but the movie is more about how his selfdestructive tendencies managed to get the better of him and lead him to an early death.

This film reminds me so much of the artist himself. It has a ton of style it is fun to watch somewhat uneventful and like the artist it is destined to be remembered because style never dies.

Bowie here remains the best ignorant art screen Warhol ever and his sidekick Dennis Hopper is perfectly toady. arguably in this context Jeff Wright was a better Basquiat than Basquiat himself. Gary Oldman is also very memorable. Maybe Dafoe wasn't fully employed but it was a glorified cameo and other cameos by Vince Gallo Christopher Walken Courtney Love and the like were perfect spices.this is not a serious movie people. it's a very tasteful loving joke by some of the folks who knew Basquiat. it's not high art like Basquiat himself but then Downtown 81 isn't altogether as amusingly crafted as this is. It's all round fun in nearly the vein of Royal Tannenbaums except halfway true".

I will concede that I have little use for Basquiat as an artist but I also have no use for Jackson Pollack as an artist and the recent movie on his life was very good.  The problem was not the subject it was the presentation.This film on Basquiat's life not only fails to leave you caring about Basquiat but with about 20 minutes to go in the movie it honestly had me wishing someone would spring out from nowhere and murder Basquiat in some act of random violence which would at least end the film.Jumpcuts being used for no apparent effect brolling of audio tracks of conversations that would have been happening only minutes prior to the time of the visual image on the screen when NOTHING is happening in the visual image that advances the story.  This technique works great as a means of compressing time showing a visual image to tell one part of a story while simultaneously presenting audio from another time and place and allowing the viewer to absorb both in half the time.  But here it was used for NO purpose.In a later scene in one of Basquiat's nonfatal heroin overdoses we are shown what his girlfriend sees when she finds him with his heart temporarily stopped and we are to realize as she did that it was a drug overdose. Well this is fine when you are watching on DVD and can go back to take a second look at the shot but when the tight shot of the syringe is simply not tight at all and when the thing is shown amid clutter and for only a second and a half I timed it the director and editor fail to allow us the opportunity to see what they are trying to show us.The movie has recurrent visual images of surfers and watersports that might have some great significance to Basquiat's life but which the director fails to even begin to convey.  They might as well be random images on the screen.The movie in a nutshell stinks and to see reviews here praising it make me wonder what planet the authors are from.This was the first directorial effort of Julian Schnabel and it is amazing anyone else trusted him with their money or careers to direct another on in 2000.  That 2000 film Before Night Falls was his only other directing effort.".

	schema:headline " An incomplete life an incomplete film";
	schema:reviewBody "This film biography of the artist JeanMichel Basquiat left me wanting to have a better understanding of him as a person and as an artist. The movie takes us from Basquiat's being a graffiti artist sleeping in a cardboard box to being a major superstar cavorting with Andy Wharhol in such a halting way that I never felt I got to know the person or his art. You might think that in covering a decade of a person's life in less than two hours director Julian Schnabel could only skate on the surface and leave us with the superficial story we get here but Schnabel himself proves that a more complete and satisfying film portrait can be accomplished by having given us a treatment of the entire life of the Cuban writer and poet Reinaldo Arenas in his magnificent Before Night Falls. The contrast between these two movies illustrates the problems I have with Basquiat. For example we are told that Basquiat came from a middleclass family so why did he wind up sleeping in a cardboard box in a New York City park? We are given a few hints about his relationship with his mother who winds up in a mental institution but not enough information to form any solid ideas about it. His father appears in one scene at an art opening but we are left with no idea about the relationship between Basquiat and his father. So whereas we come away from Before Night Falls with a firm grasp on Arenas' young life we are left with knowing almost nothing about the early Basquiat. Basquiat's personality remained opaque to me. I got very little feel for his work habits and almost no feel for his art. I knew little about his art going into this movie and was disappointed that we did not get to see enough of his work to have an opinion about it. After all that is what he was famous for. Don't most artists say that in order to know them you should know their art? If that is true Basquiat does not give us much of a chance to know the person. However if Schnabel agrees with the statement made by a person in the movie that only about twelve people in the world understand art then maybe he felt it would be pointless for us to see much of Basquiat's paintings. But Schnabel didn't seem to feel that way about his own work though since much of the art we do see is Schnabel's.Scenes that could clarify only confuse. Take for example the scene where Basquiat is being interviewed by a Larry King type reporter. Basquiat not only confounds the reporter but us as well. Was he being arrogant or rude or inarticulate or embarrassed or shy or conflicted or what? He must have signed off on giving the interview so why behave like he did?What accounts for Basuait's decline and ultimate death by heroin overdose? In one scene between Basquiat and Andy Warhol Basquiat claims to be clean and there is an indication that his work has been on the decline at that point. Is the implication that drug use fueled Basquiat's work? This is not pursued. It is shown that Warhol's death was a tremendous blow to him.The movie has a great cast with some cameo appearances being throwaways. Willem Dafoe appears as an electrician with the soppy advice to Basquiat You'll get there you'll get there. For a moment I thought I was seeing a Disney movie. And Christopher Walken is pretty much wasted in his role as an interviewer. But there is some great work by Jeffrey Wright as Basquait by Benicio Del Toro as Basquiat's early friend as well as by Dennis Hopper as an art dealer. David Bowie steals ever scene he is in as Andy Warhol  he alone makes this movie worth seeing.One area where Basquiat feels authentic is in its depiction of the New York art scene. The complex interactions among art dealers gallery owners artists critics patrons and hangerson gives us an insider's view. Clearly Schnabel knows what he is talking about here.The music is all over the map from the Rolling Stones' Waiting on a Friend to Henyrk Grecki's third symphony.As in Before Night Falls Schnabel promotes the idea of art as the manifestation of an artist's pursuit of freedom. In a scene near the end of Basquiat we see the artist standing up in a jeep and delighting as it speeds along. We get the idea that Basquiat's life was a pursuit of personal freedom that was blunted in his confronting the real world.".

Watch Biography on AE or something for an historical account of his life if that's what you're looking for. This movie is a beautifully filmed tribute to an artist by an artist. There is a scene in the film where we watch old 8mm clips of Basquiat's friend Andy Warhol. I get the feeling Julian Schnabel wished there was a big collection of 8mm home movies with which to make a tribute out of but lacking that did the next best thing and made a movie. I felt like the whole movie was a film version of friends getting together and saying remember that time he.... The film does tend to jump around a bit and not everything is explained fully. Think back on someone close to you who died. Think of how you remember that person. Not as a complete biography but a collection of memories. Times that make you laugh times that make you cry times you wish others had experienced so they can know fully what the loss means to you. This movie captures that feeling and draws you into this close group of friends. It lets you share those times from the inside. Each person is represented by at least one clip. Each person has at least one memory to share. Basquait drifts around the film in a dreamy disconnected way. These scenes are only memories. The character does not grow or change because we remember our friends the way they were when they died. We freeze them and wrap them in a protective blanket that repels all fault we may have placed on them in life. I have never watched a film that captures these feelings so well. This film made me feel like I was invited to Basquiat's wake and allowed to share in the memories.".

Perhaps they tried to make him seem aloof and mysterious but it came out wrong i.e. right. Even his walk appears to be suspiciously weird  Basquiat really did talk it like he walk it. Yet this guy lived quite recently so all the nuances of his behaviour should be wellrecorded so maybe he was really this screwed up.

Also some scenes of people acting outrageously seem made just to shock  for example when Rene Ricard rips into Basquiat's dinner party because he's accepted an offer which does not include Ricard in any way. What on Earth is a party guest doing dancing from table to table and singing in a falsetto? Snobbery of the worst kind. If I had seen this film when it came out and while I was active in the art scene I would have blindly accepted it as the Next Major Vanguard Film About An Artist but seeing it for the first time as a much older person I can't see it I don't get it because creativity is not that profound and painful and doesn't warrant that much existentialism.".

	schema:reviewBody "Crook or Basta  Rotwein oder Totsein what a cringey title is a German 100minute movie from 2004 and it is directed by Oscar winner Pepe Danquart. He is also one of the several writers working on it. The most known other name from the writing staff is probably Chris Kraus and you can check his body of work to see other fairly famous works. For Danquart it is one of his more recent films especially if you ignore his documentary and awards show works. Anyway this one we have here will have its 15th anniversary in 2 years and quite a few cast members are pretty wellknown today still not just Hbchen who plays the title character but also the likes of Bleibtreu Harfouch and Brennicke. And you also find Hader Dringer Friedrich and Weisz who are all considered among Austria's finest these days plus the late Hackl and for quite a while so no surprise the country of production here is Austria besides Germany.Now about the story I am sadly not really convinced. For a film that is basically 100 comedy well maybe 90 comedy and 10 crime it has simply not even close to enough funny moments even if the actors may all be gifted. The film stands or falls with its script and here it is unfortunately the latter. I think it is roughly on the same level as another German mobster comedy namely Mord ist mein Geschft Liebling  Killing is My Business Honey. But that one isn't particularly convincing either. Finally a few more words on Crook I never thought the central character played by Hbchen was really interesting enough or his intended transformation from crook to cook was something we could really cheer for to happen. And as if it wasn't bad enough already that this did not work out things did not look better for the supporting characters. Some of them were too gimmicky some were boring and bland. They almost never hit the right mark with this film. Don't watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "1943 audiences already knew how Bataan would end before they went to see the film but they went anyway since this Tay Garnettdirected combat picture is a rugged tribute to the 'expendable' men of the Philippines of 1942. I can't do better than James Agee's fine review when the movie came out but would like to add a few things of my own.Rather than try to show the entire evacuation and abandonment of the Phillipines which would be perhaps overwhelmingly depressing the filmmakers decided to focus on one small fictional incident that could in effect stand in for everything else. They chose wisely. What happens is that we watch a group of soldiers defend and then destroy a bridge so as to slow down the Japanese army's advance if only by a few hours to buy precious time for everyone else. None of these men wants to be a hero. They're all stuck there and would rather be someplace else. While some are more aggressive than others no one is wholly brave and though there is a good deal of nervousness and occasional cowardice they all pull together admirably in the end. Though filmed on the Culver City lot the film cleverly and expressionistic ally suggests a tropical environment. As the story progresses the jungle gets foggier. It was never too inviting to begin with by the movie's end it is absolutely forbidding. The acting is variable. Some of the casting is peculiar. Thomas Mitchell plays a corporal named Feingold but can't seem to get rid of the slight Americanstyle brogue that was so much a part of his screen persona. Desi Arnaz has a small role. There is a fairly straightforward presentation of a black man whose color is the least important thing about him. Robert Walker in what I believe is his first film has a showy role as a garrulous yarnspinning sailor. His character is I imagine supposed to be a typically charming bumptious AllAmerican boy along the lines perhaps of Van Johnson. I find Walkerwho was an excellent actorobnoxious in the part. Lloyd Nolan is tough as nails as a hardcase soldier with a dark past. The movie's biggest asset in the acting department also happens to be its star Robert Taylor. This pretty boy matine idol gives a fine performance as the sergeant with a job no man in his right mind would want. And he is in his right mind. Taylor has no vanity in the part. He is as dirty and unshaven as everyone else in the cast and at times shows flashes of depth and insight that are startling given his lightweight reputation. Taylor pulls the film together with no Duke Wayne ostentation or posturing and proves like the film to be stronger and truer to life than we might at first have imagined.".

	schema:reviewBody "In addition to Bataan being one of the finest World War II films ever done it also marked the final transformation of Robert Taylor from romantic leading man to tough action star. After this one Taylor NEVER got cast in any powder puff roles.He's a tough believable army sergeant who's in command of a squad that's been cobbled together from remnants of other squads and given a suicide rear guard mission to hold off the Japanese from taking and crossing a key bridge. Some of the other men of his squad are Lloyd Nolan Thomas Mitchell Robert Walker Barry Nelson Desi Arnaz. There's an army pilot with a plane to be repaired played by George Murphy and when Captain Lee Bowman is killed Taylor is in command.So they hold the Japanese off the Battle of Bataan in microcosm hoping for aid that never came because the United States had no aid to give at that point. In the tradition of The Alamo they all go down one at a time.Of the cast I'd single out Lloyd Nolan and Desi Arnaz.

But Lloyd Nolan was never bad in anything he ever did.Desi Arnaz is quite a revelation. His accent is pretty thick he never got to be a Latin Lover leading man like Fernando Lamas or Ricardo Montalban did. In fact that accent was part of his whole shtick with his wife later on in I Love Lucy. But Arnaz shows her he was capable of being far more than the patient but sometimes exasperated Ricky Ricardo. Too bad he never got more opportunities like Bataan.No derring do heroics in Bataan. These are ordinary people of the greatest generation doing a job that had to be done.".

	onyx:emotionText "In addition to Bataan being one of the finest World War II films ever done it also marked the final transformation of Robert Taylor from romantic leading man to tough action star. After this one Taylor NEVER got cast in any powder puff roles.He's a tough believable army sergeant who's in command of a squad that's been cobbled together from remnants of other squads and given a suicide rear guard mission to hold off the Japanese from taking and crossing a key bridge. Some of the other men of his squad are Lloyd Nolan Thomas Mitchell Robert Walker Barry Nelson Desi Arnaz. There's an army pilot with a plane to be repaired played by George Murphy and when Captain Lee Bowman is killed Taylor is in command.So they hold the Japanese off the Battle of Bataan in microcosm hoping for aid that never came because the United States had no aid to give at that point. In the tradition of The Alamo they all go down one at a time.Of the cast I'd single out Lloyd Nolan and Desi Arnaz. Nolan is another army veteran a hardbitten hardcase almost a mirror image of Taylor. Their scenes have some real bite to them.

Taylor Robert Walker as a gumchewing homesick sailor Lloyd Nolan Dezi Arnaz surprisingly effective in a dramatic role and others make splendid contributions. Special mention should be made of Philip Terry's medican underappreciated actor who is shown as committed to his job in a selfless way but finally going berserk under the pressures of war.

The Bataan of the film's title refers to both the World War II Battle of Bataan and the place Bataan which is a Central Luzon region province on Luzon island in the Philippines which occupies the whole of the Bataan Peninsula on the island . This movie's dedication states that it is dedicated to the heroes of Bataan. This classic warlike movie is nicely starred by Robert Taylor at one of his best roles as a tough sergeant  he's accompanied by a plethora of firstrate secondaries . This exciting actioner warfare completed with slice of military stereotypes although some characters are very onedimensional  as well as presenting an African American in an intelligent and sympathetic manner  attempting to avoid any racial speeches in the script . The original plot belongs to Lost patrol 1934 by John Ford  whose screenplay has been pretty imitated and remade many times but it's still a magnificent entertainment .

But never forget the very real and common  and ubiquitous  Japanese atrocities which they still are loathe to admit. Here a small number of Americans  are acting as a rear guard preventing the invading Japanese from driving south on Bataan in 1942. They have to blow a bridge and hold a ravine and are subject to snipers air attacks and infantry assaults.  It is superbly done with a great cast Desi Arnaz was quite good too. Robert Taylor cast off forever his pretty boy image of the 1930's with Garbo in his very tough portrayal of the sergeant. Most notably Bataan stands out for perhaps the best and most violent handtohand combat footage ever filmed certainly the best of its era. Also and often neglected in reviews is that Bataan featured a fully INTEGRATED Army a Jew a black an Hispanic a Filipino and so on. They were all treated equally and heroically. Bataan could not even be shown in parts of the South in the 1940's due to this. Only two other movies of the WW II period featured a black fighting bravely  Sahara and Crash Dive but none as well as here. Bataan is a marvelous film on many levels. A classic.".

Yes this is a studio shot production yes there is model work involved and yes this is unashamedly a flag waving chest thumping rally call of heroism. Based around actual events this is a fictionalised telling that also has no shame in being disparaging towards the Japanese in the film. Now are these things really a problem? This is after all 1943 a time when the US was struggling in the Pacific conflict. A loose copy of John Ford's 1934 film The Lost Patrol Bataan served as a moral booster for the public back home. The message is clear this may be tantamount to a suicide mission because well war is indeed hell but sacrifices are necessary to achieve the bigger freedom objective.Nicely directed by Tay Garnett The Postman Always Rings Twice and tightly scripted by Robert Hardy Andrews The Cross of Lorraine the film stars Robert Taylor George Murphy Thomas Mitchell Robert Walker Desi Arnaz  Lloyd Nolan. Violent and brutal for its time the hand to hand bayonet sequences are brilliantly realised Bataan is also notable for portraying a racially integrated fighting force having to come together for the greater good. This group of men are a mixed bunch different backgrounds different races and different classes. But they are in the same boat as the Japanese start to pick them off one by one and not only that but Malaria is in the camp as well. The tension is racked up the atmosphere stifling we the viewers are witness to a unique show of heroism as we live with these men during their last soul sapping days.The cast do really well when one considers they are in fact playing disposable characters. Taylor in particular is effective as the tough Sergeant forced into command of the group. While some scenes such as a moodily staged camouflaged Japanese approach are truly memorable and linger long in the memory. The end also is terrific one which puts one in mind of Sam Peckinpah watching and nodding approvingly. High on suspense and beating a real brave heart Bataan is up with the best that the war genre of film has to offer. Belyng its budget restrictions it achieves its aims and then some. 8.510".

Walkers acting was top notch.....the scene where he breaks down after writing a letter to mum....awesome. I looked at all his expressions in the film and they were so real...so authentic. Baatan is a good movie superb cast NOLAN TAYLOR...even DesiArnaz makes me wish he had done more of this type of role.A good ending splendid visual effect.....TAY Garnett did it again. This with So PROUDLY We Hail has got to be one of the greatest war movie ever.....and i also forgot the wonderful work of Thomas Mitchell and George Murphy. Bravo".

Of course when seeing the film today the viewer may think that this film is a bit anachronistic especially considering todays jaded skepticism and mentality of question everything trust no one. But given the year when the movie was made 1943 it falls right in line with the mindset of the times. The acting and sets are pretty much of the standard 30's and 40's Hollywood flair with the bad guys being very bad the good guys being very good and those that die in battle doing such without much complaint or bloodshed. But all aside I was able to get drawn into the characters lives to the point to where I was concerned with who lived and who died as well as being on the edge of my seat with all the ensuing tension that only a good war picture can give. All in all I would rate this film a must see. No this film won't deliver the intense realism as does Band of Brothers or Saving Private Ryan but it also doesn't deliver the always painful to watch introspectiveflashback ponderings that Thin Red Line does. Another plus is that there ISN'T a love story plunked down in the middle of the story line!".

	schema:headline " A very effective propaganda war film";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a very good war film with so many excellent performances and wonderful writing. About the only strikes against it were that it tends to occasionally portray stereotypes instead of true people and because the audience knows that regardless what occurs in the film the US DID lose the Battle of Bataan. First as far as the characters go I can easily forgive this. Since the film was made during the war it was meant to encourage and rally the folks at home so they made sure to put in some clichd characters to illustrate certain themes such as the sweet sailor the jivetalking Chicano or the proud and hardworking Black soldier. These people weren't played badly but they just seemed like characters pulled from a formula instead of being real folks. The same thing also occurred in such wartime films as SAHARA and DESTINATION TOKYO. However despite this the rest of the characters were very good captivating. As far as losing the battle goes this can't be changed but the Americans in the film are practically supermen because they kill off so many Japanese soldiers and make some incredibly lucky shots. Again this is because the film was intended as positive propaganda so I can look past this as well.As for the rest of the movie despite a very simple plot the film did a very good job of keeping my attention and providing a lot of realism. In particular I noticed late in the film that the surviving characters were just coated in blood splatterssomething you'd almost never see in contemporary films.Excellent acting didn't hurt as wellparticularly by Robert Taylor who previously had been seen as more of a pretty boy than a rugged actor. Ironically I saw this just after I saw Taylor in CAMILLEwhere he played a pretty simpering wuss!!! BATAAN was such a welcome change!".

	schema:headline " Simple but effective genre movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Actually it's a kind of remake of John Ford's Lost Patrol only this time in the jungles of the Bataan peninsula. A mixed group of men with varied background are pinned down by the enemy and picked off one by one in colorful ways.Characters and incidents are out of a comic book. This is not a subtle movie. If you want a greater dose of something resembling reality try Pride of the Marines or Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo or They Were Expendable. This is the kind of thing that passed for uplifting entertainment in 1943. But given the usual strictures of the genre and the times it's fairly well done. The shooting was done in a studio and looks it. The model work looks like model work too. But again if you don't expect too much in the way of authenticity it's engaging. The plastic bushes and the layer of studiogenerated fog give the film an eerie reality of its own. To be engaged though you must put up with things like there being no question of pulling out or surrendering. We fight to the last man. And there is a brutal battle towards the end in which both sides charge with bayonets. We litter the ground with Japanese dead while they manage to kill only two of our men. We shoot them grenade them bayonet them strangle them stab them and the air is filled with flying body parts all Japanese.The Japanese are referred to as Japs baboons monkeys twice rats and animals in case we hadn't got the point yet. If they capture one of our guys they work him over good before putting him out of his misery. There's a certain historical truth in much of this. Bataan was an exhausting conflict. American and Philippine troops defended the peninsula until forced to surrender and many of them died from wounds illness and malnutrition. If I recall the Japanese under General Yamashita were in almost as bad a shape. And of course the infamous death march to the prison camps doomed many of the captives. A good number of the victims were from a unit formed near Deming New Mexico where a small memorial has been built. There is nothing much worth saying about the acting. Not much acting is called for. The black soldier has a terrific baritone. Robert Walker turns in a nice performance as a wimpy sailormusician although he too is allowed to kill a number of enemy soldiers in handtohand combat. Thomas Mitchell doesn't come across as a Jake Feingold. Desi Arnaz is one of those nonnative speakers of English who use a lot of jazzy lingo when they talk. Amusing. Loyd Nolan is the most interesting character and gives by far the most droll performance. That really bothers me what you think. The best that can be said for Robert Taylor b. Spangler Arlington Borough is that he doesn't get in the way of the scenery. He began his career at MGM in the 1930s as a handsome leading man. As he grew older his features coarsened as features will but MGM kept him soldiering away in epics and ever cheaper features. His acting didn't change much.There's a curious and coincidental aspect to the casting here. Of the men in the patrol three are San Franciscans Barry Nelson Loyd Nolan and Philip Terry the medic. One of those random juxtapositions whose likelihood can only be pinpointed by use of the Poisson distribution. After all San Francisco has always been a small city at the time these actors were born probably no more than 500000. The reason Loyd Nolan sounds like a New Yorker is because so many New Yorkers came to San Francisco in the 19th century and settled in the Mission District as part of what sociologists call a chain migration. You can still hear the remnants of that New York accent in elderly San Franciscans today.".

The Japanese do not take their bridge being blown up lightly. Realistic WW2 combat scenes as a few brave men fight for survival in the South Pacific. Great ensemble cast featuring George Murphy Lloyd Nolan Thomas Mitchell Robert Walker Desi Arnaz Barry Nelson Phillip Terry and Tom Dugan. One of my favorite scenes is when the enemy invades as a group of 'walking shrubs'. Plus the energy of Arnaz as he finds Tommy Dorsey on the radio. The finale is memorable as Taylor is berserk with desire to defend himself surrounded by the enemy. Thanks to AMC and TCM for showing this classic as much as they do.".

	schema:headline " A strong entry into Hollywood's WWII propaganda movies solid performances by Robert Taylor and Lloyd Nolan";
	schema:reviewBody "This wellacted tough World War II propaganda movie is an excellent example of the MGM style Solid production values some good acting...and a tendency to hit the message out of the ball park and then hit it out again. And again. The story of a small group of soldiers fighting and dying to buy time for MacArthur to regroup around Bataan was I suspect a powerful movie when it came out in 1943. Now it's a curious mixture of Hollywood theatrics mixed with some genuinely moving moments. At nearly two hours it also goes on too long. For those who may believe that brave men can survive in propaganda war movies read no further. It's early 1942 in the Philippines and Sergeant Bill Dane Robert Taylor with a mixed bag of semivolunteers are given the assignment of blowing up a bridge which would otherwise be a primary crossing point for the invading Japanese army as it races south. They must also set up a defensive position across the chasm to keep the Japanese from rebuilding. Dane is a competent nononsense Army lifer. The only other regular Army men he has is Corporal Jake Finegold Thomas Mitchell a wise old hand and longtime friend and Corporal Barney Todd Lloyd Nolan a cynic who may have a history with Dane. The other ten men include an enthusiastic Navy corpsman an engineer an air force pilot a medic and a supply corporal. The story line is simple. As we learn about these men and their histories the Japanese pick them off one by one. And as they die the dedication of the remaining men only grows stronger. We're left with the image of a row of graves barely visible as ground fog sweeps among them with the rifles of the dead men thrust into the ground as headstone markers. Then the movement of Japanese soldiers creeping in for the final attack...with Sergeant Dane exhausted and wounded the last remaining man rising to his feet clutching his machine gun and blazing away at the charging enemy. Come on suckers he screams come and get it! We're still here! We'll always be here!The cast is small and gets smaller. Demographically it matches Hollywood's idea of America. There's an Hispanic a black a Jew a misfit a young kid a Philippine scout a...well you get the idea. Thomas Mitchell as Corporal Finegold plays his patented role of giving us some of the movie's messages. When early in the movie Dane bemoans how unprofessional his group of soldiers is Finegold just says You can't always tell sergeant. Some of those kids learn pretty quick and kinda good. Later when Dane is discouraged and says I wonder how long these guys can stand up to this stuff Corporal Finegold says to Dane and to the theater goers Those kids signed up for this just like you and me. They'll get tired sure. Things'll get tough sure. But I don't think they'll put their tails between their legs and run anymore than you would. Robert Walker in his first credited film role plays the very young gum chewing corpsman. It's wise to remember that in propaganda movies it can be fatal to start dictating a letter home to your Mom. George Murphy plays the pilot who manages to get his biwing aircraft off but is wounded in the process. As with the other men he chooses to die heroically. Even a conscientious objector who signed on as a noncombat medic winds up throwing grenades. Robert Taylor and Lloyd Nolan are particularly effective. I couldn't help but admire the professionalism of the movie. Yet knowing the men are going to get picked off combined with the length of the movie had me tensing every time someone decided to stand up write a letter peer over a sandbag talk about his life back home or sing a spiritual. The tension is effective for the first hour but after a while it got to be a strain. The one facetoface fight towards the end of the movie when Japanese soldiers camouflaged to look like brush and bushes begin to move toward the remaining men and the men respond first with machine guns and then with bayonets was a relief. It also was a brutal look at handtohand combat. It's hard to beat war propaganda that lets us see average men and women gladly dying for a cause nobler than their own lives. At that level the movie works. Bataan may be dated but if you enjoy older war movies you might like this one.".

Other action includes more deafening explosions shootouts and battle scenes which all make very heavy use of Gattling guns springfield rifles and grenades.But at times there is a lot of dialogue and the film is very bleak as with most war movies. There is a lot of quite frightening and harrowing scenes some which include several characters dying of malaria or being killed in battle for a 70 year old film there is quite a lot of blood and gore. In the aftermath of a skirmish many of the main characters are dead or wounded and one character is nearly completely covered in blood and the rest of the characters are nearly covered in their comrades or their enemys blood very disturbing now i know why its hardly on TV.At the end of the movie every single character apart from Robert taylor is dead. Taylor finds himself surrounded by enemy soldiers and in a state of frenzy begins machine gunning every soldier he can see. The film ends with a front view of the machine gun relentlessly firing out shots as a message appears on the screen. After this the usual The End card appears.All in all quite a brutal and hard hitting antiwar drama but still one of the best. Highly recommended for war movie fans.".

I love the odd mixture of servicemen all lumped together at this forgotten outpost with a single yet futile mission. Destroy the bridge and keep on destroying it. Men are lost one by one yet they stay. Everyone has character flaws and everyone rises to heroic proportions when duty calls for it. That spirit of sacrifice and true grit fight is why the allies won the war.All Americans knew of the fate of Bataan  McCarthur's retreat the death marches and the horrific loss of life. This film captures that tragic story magnificently with fine performances from all of the characters and excellent direction. A perfect screening for a Memorial Day weekend.".

	schema:reviewBody "Many Wars Ago 1970 Dir Francesco RosiThe First World War has been the subject of countless works of art in the last ninety years and with good reason. It's the conflict we remember from our studies as the most needless of all years of reckless leadership territorial stalemates and extremely high casualties all reverberations from a single political assassination in Sarajevo. If ever there was a true story that could be used to illustrate the horrors of war and the societal implications of diplomatic oneupmanship the Great War was it. It was a conflict without ideologies where millions died simply because they felt obliged to represent their country. With this film Francesco Rosi addresses the fundamental foolishness of blind obedience in the bluntest way he can. We are not shown the characters' civilian lives nor are we privy to their hopes and dreams. There is very little psychology explored either and no moments of empathy for the enemy. Many Wars Ago is almost devoid of humanity the soldiers we follow simply trudge onwards advancing and retreating abandoning vantage points only to reclaim them the next day. In this way it is a pure war movie because it excludes all but the faltering military machines and the devastation they cause across forgotten fronts.The film focuses on the futile actions of an Italian division in the Balkans. There are many slow shots of the dirtied infantry marching onward into the mist then we cut to an Austrian ambush or an Italian offensive at varying times of day. Some are over hills some in the forests. General Leone is in charge and seems eerily invincible as well as violently mad. His patriotism is the only excuse necessary for putting thousands of men in unnecessary danger even in the context of a difficult open combat situation and sending many to their deaths for cowardice insubordination or mere clumsiness. Two lieutenants are the closest the audience will get to traditional protagonists and they are compellingly played as downtrodden and pragmatic. They are never passionate because the war has sucked it out of them they only try to make the best of Leone's wild commands and save as many lives as possible.There is rarely respite in the bleak delivery of this material. It makes war seem utterly wretched and that's exactly what it's supposed to for which Rosi should be commended. It is a serious war movie free of sentimentalism and clich although it may be too clinical for some viewers. In the eyes of Lieutenants Ottolenghi and Sassu we can see a back story that most directors would be happy to include if only in a monologue or a brief stilted conversation but not here. Rosi gives us nothing in the way of emotional reference points  these soldiers are young but weathered and we can only guess at what made them this way. Two especially decent scenes should be mentioned one in which we see the soldiers showing Leiutenant Sassu that the Austrian snipers have their guns aimed precisely to fire through a tiny metal shutter in the Italian defensive wall and another at the end of the movie where Leone discovers that Sassu has fought in all of his conflicts without being wounded. Both of these scenes cleverly exemplify the edgy nearmutinous condition of the ailing Italian forces at this point in the war. They are debilitated and disillusioned the pointlessness of it all is staring them in the face and the audience has no idea how their movements affect the bigger picture of the Balkan front or the rest of the war at all. This may be the film's most skilfully communicated concept  there is no sense of scale no back story only mountains and cavalry and suicidal charges and endless mist mutiny and strafing gunfire. That's why this is one of the darkest Great War movies ever made. Rosi tells us that his beginning is not a beginning that his end is not an end and that the machine of war pushes onward through the everdeveloping chaos.".

Tori Black is a good substitute for Lee Merriweather thankfully she does not even try to be Julie Nuemar but then who could and Evan Stone is hams it up nicely in place of Frank Gorshin as the Riddler. Neil Hamilton look alike Jack English stoically keeps the dignity and closet homosexuality of Coms. Gordon in tact and Lexi Belle just about fills Yvonne Craig's costume.As a parody as an homage and as a remake the best porn parody of a major motion picture since Flesh Gordon.I tip my hat to you guys.".

	schema:headline " More Fun When the Cast Keep Their Clothes On";
	schema:reviewBody "A lovingly made Xrated parody the sets and costumes of which satisfyingly capture the 60's Pop Art look of the TV series and which producerdirector Axel Braun's affectionate script shows fond knowledge of the original.Dale DaBone and James Deen pass the Adam West test by acquitting themselves beautifully in their early scenes as Bruce  Dick playing threedimensional chess at Wayne Manor although Deen should have trimmed his sideburns a common anachronism that regularly destroys the illusion in films set prior to the late 60's. Evan Stone is sublimely out of his mind as The Riddler and the scene in which he has his evil way with Bruce Wayne's girlfriend Lisa Carson  and she plainly enjoys it  fulfills the sexual tension Frank Gorshin brought to the part in the original he always had the hottest henchbabes and it would have been great to see Riddler and Anna Gram slowly unzip one another before even more slowly slipping out of their spandex and into each other and promises to take the plot in an interesting direction which it unfortunately doesn't follow just as none of the obvious jokes about the feminine allure of The Catwoman coming between Batman and his little buddy Robin are ever attempted. No serious attempt is made to make Lexi Belle resemble Yvonne Craig as Barbara Gordon but she amply compensates for this with her ditzy Batgirl who is far more sexually knowing than she ever was in the TV series.Ironically it's the lengthy sex scenes  which account for the whopping total running time of 119 minutes  that hold up the fun and which for the most part I found myself tempted to fast forward like the songs in a Bollywood movie. The exceptions to this reservation are The Riddler ravishing Lisa Carson although it would have been better still had the Prince of Puzzlers been exercising droit du seigneur over conquered adversary Batgirl or cementing their partnership in crime horizontally with fellow archcriminal The Catwoman and  at last!  Batgirl making out with Robin although her costume comes off far too quickly and we don't even get to see her remove it which would have been ninetenths of the fun!Most perplexing of all is the extremely delayed entrance of the film's most obvious asset Tori Black as The Catwoman who certainly looks the part although her grasp of the character isn't really up to much including wearing her belt up round her waist rather than down round her hips as Newmar et al did but incredibly doesn't appear until the second half and doesn't come centre stage until the final third. 'Batman XXX' draws most of its inspiration from the very first episodes of Season One  in which The Catwoman only appeared once  so we sadly get none of Eartha Kitt's Season Three interaction with Batgirl which had included tying her up a couple of times and a brief facetoface tussle in a courtroom although the script does include Batman's magnanimous description of Eartha's Catwoman as she may be evil but she... is attractive. Black's classic Catwoman look is also so uniquely sexy that the inevitable result is Catch22. The film would have been far far sexier had it lingered longer on her sprawled about in her black wetlook catsuit rather than rushing with unnecessary haste into undressing her SPOILER COMING for a final threesome with the Dynamic Duo that I frankly found  if you'll pardon the word  anticlimactic and even in the throes of erotic abandon would such a wellbred pair of gentlemen as Bruce  Dick really have sworn so much? although made up for by a satisfying final twist implying a sequel never alas made.".

	onyx:emotionText "A lovingly made Xrated parody the sets and costumes of which satisfyingly capture the 60's Pop Art look of the TV series and which producerdirector Axel Braun's affectionate script shows fond knowledge of the original.Dale DaBone and James Deen pass the Adam West test by acquitting themselves beautifully in their early scenes as Bruce  Dick playing threedimensional chess at Wayne Manor although Deen should have trimmed his sideburns a common anachronism that regularly destroys the illusion in films set prior to the late 60's. Evan Stone is sublimely out of his mind as The Riddler and the scene in which he has his evil way with Bruce Wayne's girlfriend Lisa Carson  and she plainly enjoys it  fulfills the sexual tension Frank Gorshin brought to the part in the original he always had the hottest henchbabes and it would have been great to see Riddler and Anna Gram slowly unzip one another before even more slowly slipping out of their spandex and into each other and promises to take the plot in an interesting direction which it unfortunately doesn't follow just as none of the obvious jokes about the feminine allure of The Catwoman coming between Batman and his little buddy Robin are ever attempted. No serious attempt is made to make Lexi Belle resemble Yvonne Craig as Barbara Gordon but she amply compensates for this with her ditzy Batgirl who is far more sexually knowing than she ever was in the TV series.Ironically it's the lengthy sex scenes  which account for the whopping total running time of 119 minutes  that hold up the fun and which for the most part I found myself tempted to fast forward like the songs in a Bollywood movie. The exceptions to this reservation are The Riddler ravishing Lisa Carson although it would have been better still had the Prince of Puzzlers been exercising droit du seigneur over conquered adversary Batgirl or cementing their partnership in crime horizontally with fellow archcriminal The Catwoman and  at last!  Batgirl making out with Robin although her costume comes off far too quickly and we don't even get to see her remove it which would have been ninetenths of the fun!Most perplexing of all is the extremely delayed entrance of the film's most obvious asset Tori Black as The Catwoman who certainly looks the part although her grasp of the character isn't really up to much including wearing her belt up round her waist rather than down round her hips as Newmar et al did but incredibly doesn't appear until the second half and doesn't come centre stage until the final third.

	schema:reviewBody "Having losing gaining... to a generation of kids this WAS Batman. Only when Tim Burton reinvented the big screen perception of the caped crusader did it become outdated. The third of the new films Batman Forever parodied this film and the series with a holy joke. Unfortunately the movie in question was the first to be directed by Joel Schumacher and so was consequently brash and bereft of wit. Yes thanks to ShoeMaker this version of Gotham has suddenly become the coolest yet again. It's all such brilliant fun awash with the irony so gloriously absent from Batman  Robin. Michael Keaton was a wonderfully dark Batman but the other two were planks. Adam West is knowingly hammy as the title role and relishes the deliberately cheesy lines. He has a potbelly and a costume that looks like it was made out of an old binliner. Anyone who cannot see the genius of that is beyond help. Burt Ward's brilliantly overacted Robin is also hilarious and far less irritating than the asinine Chris O'Donnell version. The Batmobile is ace too. I remember having a chunky Corgi model of the car that shot out matchsticks across the room. Much better than a CGIenhanced penile extension. Even the rubbish filmed backdrops are fun. Everything's a batsomething in this film a rope ladder having a large Bat Ladder sign tied to the end. This is a fantastic movie how could anyone not love it? Some hilarious scenes include the shark fight the trap door spring and Batman with the biggest and longestfused bomb in history. Look at this dialogue exchange where they try to work out which supervillain is behind the mayhem But wait! It happened at sea. See? C for Catwoman. An exploding shark ... was pulling my leg. The Joker! It all led to a sinister riddle. Riddle er. Riddler? Fortunately it turns out they're all involved along with Burgess Meredith as the Penguin. The scenes set on the villains' hideout are shot with the camera at slanted angles an inspired touch. All the poor things about this film work in its favour  Cesar Romero as the Joker looks about 80 and clearly hasn't bothered to shave off his moustache but it works as does the fullbore acting of Meredith and Merriwether. Only Frank Gorshin as the Riddler slightly disappoints though that's because he's nowhere near as over the top. He is of course infinitely preferable to Jim Carrey. Anyway they all work superbly together and the film doesn't feel topheavy. A huge flaw of the new series where more than one villain never quite clicked can you imagine Nicholson Pfeiffer Carrey and DeVito all in the same movie? Of course it'd be impossible not just in budget but in egos so having modest TV actors here serves the story well. One strange element of characterisation is seeing the Joker getting bossed around by the Penguin something that would never happen in the comics. Some of it's so wilfully silly it almost goes too far. If you put your tongue into your cheek you may choke and seeing a Pentagon head playing tiddlywinks eggs the joke a little though the whole thing is so wellmeaning that you simply can't hold it against the movie. The plot though really isn't up to much at all something I never noticed as a child but then I never realised it was a comedy when I was a child either. A repetitious sequence of events that sees the villains constantly trying to destroy Batman and Robin from afar the heroes trying to locate their secret base. It goes round in circles but a glorious Biff! Pow! fight on a submarine and a sideways swipe at eugenics make sure it all ends in style.Lastly look out for the scene where Ward and West run up and down on the spot Luckily we're in tiptop condition! while a film background of a street and the theme tune play  a classic. Simple silly fun and almost relentlessly appealing. So much so I nearly added another point to the total... 610.".

	schema:reviewBody "1966 was among many other things the year of Batman. This campy color TV series very loosely based on the classic comic strip was originally planned for a fall debut. But the ABC network which commissioned the show had already seen several of their new programs fail dismally in the ratings. Desperate for some promising new material. they gave Batman the green light and it premiered in January. Thanks to it's 'hip' humor an eyepopping kaleidoscope of bizarre color backgrounds and a cast of guest villains second to none Julie Newmar Cesar Romero Anne Baxter Burgess Meredith the list goes on and on the show was an immediate smash. Suddenly America became batty and it's popularity was so great that stars scrambled for a chance to appear on the program. Along with its ratings success came the brilliant merchandising campaign  everything from bubble gum cards and records to underwear and cereal. Inevitably a movie was planned supposedly either to introduce audiences to the show which wasn't necessary after all because the program was picked up first or to sell the series overseas. It's main function of course was to cash in on the Batmania flooding the country while it was still hot. So with a slightly bigger budget  mainly to accommodate the construction of the batboat and the batcopter a feature version of the show was quickly filmed between the end of the first season and the beginning of the second. By the time of the movie's release in August 1966 however the Batman craze had already begun to fade. The critics for the most part dismissed the film and audiences chose to ignore it. And in recent years there has been some speculation as to what happened. Although it has been written that Twentieth CenturyFox did little to inform the public that this was a project made exclusively for the big screen and not as with The Man from Uncle a compilation of previously seen television episodes edited into a feature. In fact the movie was promoted both in advertising materials trailers posters etc and magazine features as being All New Made Especially for the Giant Motion Picture Screen. It appears that the viewing public felt that it was probably just more of the same figuring there was no point in paying to see what they got for free at home. So despite mass bookings in every theater available the film came and went. But seen today Batman holds up well capturing perfectly what was one of the biggest fads to come along in the sixties. Adam West and Burt Ward personify the clueless but virtuous Superheroes  always ready for a challenge and as usual lionized by their puny police force led by Commissioner Gordon Neil Hamilton and Chief O'Hara Stafford Repp. Alfred alterego Bruce Wayne's faithful butler Alan Napier and Harriet Cooper Madge Blake aunt of Robin's alter ego Dick Grayson are on hand as well. The chief delight here though are the four Supervillains  The Catwoman Lee Meriwether subbing for Julie Newmar The Penguin a rakish Burgess Meredith The Joker onetime Latin lover Cesar Romero and The Riddler a manic Frank Gorshin. The plot the usual nonsense involving this crew's attempt at world domination serves as a suitable background for sight gags and pratfalls galore. Meriwether and Meredith are the Villains with the most footage each getting to disguise themselves during the course of the story. Posing as Russian reporter Miss Kitka and sporting a commendably convincing accent the incredibly lovely Meriwether is understandably successful in a scheme to lure Bruce Wayne into a kidnapping hoping Batman will dash to the rescue! Meredith is not quite as able in his guise as the villain's hostage Commodore Schmidlapp though he does manage to get into the secret Batcave. And the plot thickens...West and Ward perform their chores with appropriately deadpan dispatch but as usual the devils have the best parts with Lee Meriwether offering a deliciously different interpretation of The Catwoman and Burgess Meredith who was born to play The Penguin standing out. Batman is great fun both for younger viewers who won't pick up on the intentional parody and older ones who will. Holy time capsule! Sevaral years ago a wide screen DVD was released. It boasts an excellent transfer Stereo sound and many extras including a running commentary track with West and Ward trailers still galleries and new featurettes about the film and the Batmobile with creator George Barris. A MUST for Batfans!".

	schema:reviewBody "Tim Burton's BATMAN is for people who take comic books seriously. The Adam West BATMAN TV series and movie is for the rest of us.Batman is the role West was born to play.

It was always intended as comedy and the special effcts acting etc. were designed to that effect. Maybe it's okay in comic books but can anyone take seriously a bunch of crazy herovillains running around in capes and tights? You have to look back to those 13 chapter scifi serials of the 1940's to get the showmovie each chapter ended with the heroes getting blown up then the next chapter showed the last 5 minuts of the previous chapter except with the added footage showing the hero's escape. Then another 5 minutes of the characters recapping the entire story for the benefit of the audience if they hadn't seen the previous chapters. Quite amusing to watch today I would recommend Lost City of the Jungle which loosely inspired Indiana Jones and has those credits that stream up the screen like in Star Wars. That's why the Batman series were always 2parters with ridiculous cliff hanger endings with Batman uttering If I can only reach my utility belt... Adam West's performance can only be characterised as sublimely surreal he really deserves an award. The only thing that comes close to this is Mystery Men which many also unfortunately don't seem to get.".

Yeah it's a complete turn around from the original comic books but it's just non stop laughter and even the actors were aware of that.

Not to mention the fun villains who are just so filthy and diabolical.I am in love with this script I mean it's so cheesy but it did it on purpose. Like when Batman finds out the true identity of Catwoman and Robin says Holy Heartbreak!. Or my favorite scene that is possibly my favorite scene of all time where Batman has a bomb in his hands and is trying to get it out of people's way so they won't get killed but no matter what he keeps bumping into the same marching band in the streets or finding people in the way and finally he just sighs and says Some days you just can't get rid of a bomb.

	schema:headline " HOLY INSERTJOKEHERE! this is one of the corniest awesomecamp movies ever made!";
	schema:reviewBody "Try not to put it too much at all in line with the other Batman movies first of all. The difference between Christopher Nolan's Batman films and the 1960's TV show and subsequent spinoff movie is the difference between a hat and a boot they both fit but never in the same sections unless one likes walking on a hat or wearing a boot. Weird comparison? Try some of the oneliners in this movie man! This is filled with so much comedy both intentional and not so one has to keep a tally on when things are meant to be crazy and when they just are by design of whatever's going on in the lowbudget but high concept stratosphere. This is NOT your darker Frank MillerGrant MorrisonAlan Moore Batman work but rather the byproduct of a period where superheroes were just frigging goofy. And hey why not camp it up for all it's worth? My high rating for this movie is and isn't ironic. It's got some of the cheesiest lamest most whatinJebuzweretheythinking sets and props the shark is something Ed Wood would've cut out dialog exchanges and superobvious stereotypes not the least of which on commies but also the UN room! and it looks like half of its 30day shooting schedule was used to play pingpong when things got boring on the set. It is at its core for Bob Kane's creation what the 1978 Holiday Special was the George Lucas's Star Wars it's so bad it's truly and utterly awesome for every moment it can squeeze out a frame. Watch it with friends make wisecracks right alongside the characters make your own Joker makeup and put it over your mustache and try and put out of your mind HOLY ALMOST!BUT at the same time some of the writing by Lorenzo Semple Jr is genuinely clever and wellworded.

	onyx:emotionText "Try not to put it too much at all in line with the other Batman movies first of all. The difference between Christopher Nolan's Batman films and the 1960's TV show and subsequent spinoff movie is the difference between a hat and a boot they both fit but never in the same sections unless one likes walking on a hat or wearing a boot. Weird comparison? Try some of the oneliners in this movie man! This is filled with so much comedy both intentional and not so one has to keep a tally on when things are meant to be crazy and when they just are by design of whatever's going on in the lowbudget but high concept stratosphere. This is NOT your darker Frank MillerGrant MorrisonAlan Moore Batman work but rather the byproduct of a period where superheroes were just frigging goofy. And hey why not camp it up for all it's worth? My high rating for this movie is and isn't ironic. It's got some of the cheesiest lamest most whatinJebuzweretheythinking sets and props the shark is something Ed Wood would've cut out dialog exchanges and superobvious stereotypes not the least of which on commies but also the UN room! and it looks like half of its 30day shooting schedule was used to play pingpong when things got boring on the set. It is at its core for Bob Kane's creation what the 1978 Holiday Special was the George Lucas's Star Wars it's so bad it's truly and utterly awesome for every moment it can squeeze out a frame. Watch it with friends make wisecracks right alongside the characters make your own Joker makeup and put it over your mustache and try and put out of your mind HOLY ALMOST!BUT at the same time some of the writing by Lorenzo Semple Jr is genuinely clever and wellworded. Amid the stupidity and pandering and things that only kids would think are somewhat OK in the comicbook setting and even I when I saw this as a kid knew it was WAY outside of the usual Batman ground one marvels at some of the puns and gags and things that work tremendously.

	schema:reviewBody "Batman The Movie is a tiein to the camp classic Batman TV series starring Adam West and Burt Ward. The long running problem with this series is how easy it for people to insult it and say how it tarnished Batman's name. These people obviously did not get the joke or they have honestly never picked up an actual Batman comic from the 60s Look up BatBaby and then tell me this series wasn't tame in comparison to the actual comics back in the day. This movie is the only film on DVD that shows true parody of the censorship act that comics had undergone during the late 50s and throughout the 1960s. This show whether you like it or not saved Batman from extinction so that he could move into the more serious medium we have today.Enough about the history of the show! Batman The Movie takes the manic energy of the infamous TV show and takes it up a notch something that seemed impossible. The film is just downright funny plain and simple especially if you fully understand what it is that they are making fun of bad campy propaganda filled comics of the 1960s. Sure with films like Batman Begins and The Dark Knight it's hard to take Adam West seriously but then again you aren't supposed to take him seriously in the first place! The plot is ridiculous yet consistently entertaining as the dynamic duo of Batman and Robin are pitted against the fiendish supervillian team which consists of the wisecracking Joker Cesar Romero the sneering Penguin Burgess Meredith the scheming Riddler Frank Gorshin and the seductive Catwoman Lee Meriwether. What is the villains' dastardly plan? To dehydrate the world's leaders into dust and hold the world at ransom! Batman and Robin will have to pass through a multitude of fiendish gizmos and traps in order to prevent universal chaos but on the way they will undoubtedly bring laughter to the audience.From an exploding shark questions with an answer involving a machine gun toting sparrow and cheesy romantic interludes this movie is a riot! Adam West's and Burt Ward's deadpan delivery of their lines is always perfect given the absurd nature of the situations they constantly find themselves in.Anyone who doesn't get this series' humor and thinks it's a stain on the Batman franchise seriously needs to lighten up and go back to the older comics and find out how great their beloved Caped Crusader was during the censorship laws. Doing that you'll probably have a greater appreciation for the humor of the Adam West era of the character's development.So if you like comics or just like manic paced comedies with straightfaced acting See The Naked Gun Get Smart Batman The Movie is definitely worth looking into! I recommend buying the 'Holy Special Edition' version of the film most because it has the best packaging and sets you up for comedy the new DVD case is obviously modeled off of the Tim Burton Batman film's cases and just looks too serious considering the subject material contained within. I don't know about you but I like my DVD cases and art to tell me what I'm in store for. Putting the case aside both DVDs come with the same special features features that are sure to make any BatFan smile! If you haven't already done it Do yourself a favor and purchase 'Batman  The Movie'".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is simultaneously one of the best comic book movies and one of the best parodies of a comic book. This film is simultaneously silly and surreal. This film is simultaneously subversive and earnest. A young kid can watch this and think it is deadpan serious a young adult can hoot and jeer and a 40yearold can simultaneously do both.That this film can contain such paradoxes and can remain appealing 46 years after its release is due to a variety of factors that all worked together. Set and costume design are excellent writing and directing were spot on perfect and the cast were all great. From a visual standpoint few films can even rival this one's mimetic resemblance of classic comic books.But the single strongest and most miraculous thing that which holds it all together is the sheer inspiration of Adam West's performance.Bruce Wayne has a remarkable amount of screen time here especially compared to any episode of the TV series. Note also that in 2 out of 3 fight scenes Adam is dressed as Bruce Wayne. It is highly gratifying to see Batman alone and outnumbered outfight the villains without so much as a Batarang to aid him.By means of some incredible unknown energy Adam West was able to convey a character who is compelling intense brave noble and suave. Yet if one possesses just the slightest bit of insight Batman is also completely ridiculous. Of the many many hero parodies that came from the 60's and later from Maxwell Smart to Matt Helm to Captain Nice James Coburn as Derek Flynt is the only other with the potential to come across as a credible heroic lead. But Batman unlike Derek Flynt shows a few precious and very brief moments of emotional vulnerability. Derek Flynt is 1dimensional Batman is 2dimensional. The bitter truth is that very very few fictional characters really achieve 3dimensionality.Thus it is that this wonderfullywritten and perfectlyexecuted character straddles the razor edge that usually separates parody from epic. Despite the absurdity of the character and the situations Adam West with his leading man good looks supercool manner and heroic intensity causes one to simultaneously jeer at him and admire him. In all the annals of adventure he resembles no one so much as Don Quixote.Because Adam West's Batman in the TV incarnation at least was so influential because it so thoroughly skewered every heroic clich and because the TV show ultimately succumbed to the lowest of buffoonery this film is singularly reviled by many Batman fans and comic fans in general. And yet because this film so deftly places one foot knowingly in the world of absurdity and one foot earnestly in the world of the heroism there are few better cinematic translations of comic book material.To be sure this film took huge liberties with the source material. But so has every other successful comic book movie. And most fail to capture anything of the spirit of the comic book. This is why this film continues to be hugely popular after all these years why it is still one of the most watched films of the 1960's and why it is vastly superior to a modern mess such as 'Batman Returns.' I have watched this movie at least 10 times in my life and there are many many people who have seen this even more often.The currently available DVD is a decent package and the featurette of Adam West and Burt Ward is OK although it is a little sad to see how tubby Robin has become and what a creepy guy Adam seems to be in real life. In the featurette they tell many stories that you might already know if you read any books or internet articles on the show. The interactive menu is cool and fun. There is a photo album from the series that is also cool. There is a horribly painful Batmobile featurette wherein the car's creator George Barris leans against the car and confabulates wildly about it. I love the Batmobile but this is truly sad and pathetic to see this once great hotrod king unable to even accurately describe or remember the truth about his most famous creation. My guess is that the guy had the beginnings of some form of geriatric dementia when this portion was filmed. Honestly this portion should be expunged out of respect for George Barris in particular and all senior citizens in general.".

	schema:headline " Holy deus ex machina Batman";
	schema:reviewBody "This is the Batman movie made shortly after the television series started in 1966. I actually kind of enjoyed the film. Granted Adam West and Burt Ward were pretty hammy the special effects were pretty cheap probably even for back then and there was more cheese to be found than on a tour of a Kraft factory. However it seemed to serve as a period piece to some extent of the late 1960's. Everything in the film was intentionally cartoonish probably because they wanted to keep the feel of the Batman comics of the time and it did have some fine actors as the villains you know Ceser Romero Lee Meriwether Burgess Meredith and Frank Gorshin. Here's the plot. Batman and Robin figure out that the Joker Catwoman the Penguin and the Riddler must be in on some kind of plot to take over the world after a yacht carrying an eccentric inventor and his invention go missing en route to Gotham. The villains decide that they'll lure Batman to their secret lair to kill him by kidnapping Bruce Wayne if you don't know his secret identity you're probably the only person in the world except for the citizens of Gotham. They lure Bruce in by having Catwoman disguise herself as a Russian reporter who woos him. You'll have to see the rest to figure out what is going on and the rest of the plot I don't want to give it away and it's pretty wacky. Oh and the Penguin managed to buy a prenuclear submarine from the US Navy leaving only a P.O. Box number as his address. Apparently the Navy is as haphazard as the rest of Gotham and admirals play tidily winks with their secretaries when they should be reviewing important documents.The thing that always struck me about the Batman TV series and movie is that no matter what obscure form of death the villains had for Batman and Robin they always had something on their utility belts that would save them. It's like they each had the entire contents of a woman's handbag on their waists plus a few other things that no one knows what the hell they are. Of course they're always saved in the nick of time. The other question I've always had is how the hell didn't they figure out that Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson are Batman and Robin. It's like the frigging SupermanClark Kent mystery. Just look at their faces and listen to them talk. Even with the masks on it's not that hard. Sheesh the citizens of Gotham have to be the most gullible people in the world.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is the Batman movie made shortly after the television series started in 1966. I actually kind of enjoyed the film. Granted Adam West and Burt Ward were pretty hammy the special effects were pretty cheap probably even for back then and there was more cheese to be found than on a tour of a Kraft factory. However it seemed to serve as a period piece to some extent of the late 1960's. Everything in the film was intentionally cartoonish probably because they wanted to keep the feel of the Batman comics of the time and it did have some fine actors as the villains you know Ceser Romero Lee Meriwether Burgess Meredith and Frank Gorshin. Here's the plot. Batman and Robin figure out that the Joker Catwoman the Penguin and the Riddler must be in on some kind of plot to take over the world after a yacht carrying an eccentric inventor and his invention go missing en route to Gotham. The villains decide that they'll lure Batman to their secret lair to kill him by kidnapping Bruce Wayne if you don't know his secret identity you're probably the only person in the world except for the citizens of Gotham. They lure Bruce in by having Catwoman disguise herself as a Russian reporter who woos him. You'll have to see the rest to figure out what is going on and the rest of the plot I don't want to give it away and it's pretty wacky.

Not only is this movie wellanimated exciting and tautlyplotted it's also refreshingly understated.  Unlike its liveaction cohorts more specifically the Schumacher duo Phantasm does not rely on splashy effects ridiculous action sequences and a hokey soundtrack to pull it through.  As much as I love Batman Returns I have to admit this is probably the bestwritten of the Batman films.  And tell me you don't get chills down your spine the first time Bruce Wayne puts on that cowl.

A dark story darker than in Batman Returns but also an excellent portrayal of Batman. The characters are nicely drawn the female character is very attractive looking and the voices are perfect. The origin of my favorite superhero has been overdone so many times and yet the filmmakers easily succeed to bring new insight and depth to the man that is the bat. I feel like I should write something more about it there's definitely a lot of stuff I forgot since seeing it but this was definitely an overlooked movie.810".

The animation in this movie is excellent the script isn't a masterpiece but it's very good and the actors involved include some great talents like Stacy Keach 'The Ninth Configuration' 'Star Wars' Mark Hamill as The Joker John P.

This story tells of a character not ever quite named but called here as 'Phantasm' who is killing off some of the highrolling gangsters in town. Meanwhile Bruce Wayne meets an old love of his Andrea and old wounds are opened over a brief and untimely ended engagement. And then there's also Andrea's father who... OK not much to try and spoil here lets just say at some point the Joker gets involved and everything jets into a 'laughing matter'.Even as it was meant originally for TV the directors Radomski and Timm through their writer collaborators have applied a drawing style that is distinctive amongst other cartoons of its ilk from the period very direct lines and sharp jagged edges lots of smoke at specific times the right blend of noir when it comes to revealing the caped crusader when he enters a room in the dead of night. In a sense they're stylists as are the good directors of the franchise liveaction films. Only here there's a catch the running time is short originally the filmmakers thought it would be meant for TV before WB changed their minds so there's only so much time to dig into the dilemma Wayne is caught in in the movie where his identity is being crosschecked all over as the killer of the gangsters and then the personal connection with Andrea and her father. Its some fairly significant probing into the character if not the deepest there's ever been.But also aside from the slightly darker impulses Mask of the Phantasm is a lot of fun even up to a point if you didn't watch the series much. Just seeing Hammil ham it up as the Joker is a blast even though he doesn't appear almost one might think as a lark until halfway through the movie! But he via the filmmakers trying their best to give fans the best of the animated basics supplies a hugely entertaining climax one which involves a big fight among an immense diorama of Gotham City rigged with explosives!".

	schema:headline " The Best Batman Movie of All Time";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie made perfect use of the BTAS theme music for Bruce WayneBatman several times. The best example of such use was in THE BIG CHASE. THE BIG CHASE is the greatest Batman Scene ever made. The story is quite tragic and doesn't have a happy ending. Batman is being blamed for a series of highprofile murders in Gotham and the police quickly turn against him. In reality the Phantasm is the one killing the mobsters. Andrea Bruce's former love flies into Gotham weeks after the murders begin.She triggers several flashbacks throughout the story that show us the events that led to Bruce becoming Batman. This includes the incredibly sad movement that prompts Bruce to don the cowl. Alfred's shocked gasp of My God . . . says it all.This is a continuation of the famous BTAS Batman the Animated Series of the 1990's. Many fans consider it to be the definitive version of Batman. Kevin Conroy is THE voice of Batman.The series was widely praised for its thematic complexity darker tone artistic quality and modernization of its title character's crimefighting origins. IGN listed The Animated Series as the best adaptation of Batman anywhere outside of comics the best comic book cartoon of all time and the second best animated series of all time after The Simpsons. Wizard magazine also ranked it 2 of the greatest animated television shows of all time again after The Simpsons. TV Guide ranked it the seventh Greatest Cartoon of All Time out of 60. The universal acclaim led the series to win four Emmy Awards including Outstanding Animated Program.".

	onyx:emotionText "This movie made perfect use of the BTAS theme music for Bruce WayneBatman several times. The best example of such use was in THE BIG CHASE. THE BIG CHASE is the greatest Batman Scene ever made. The story is quite tragic and doesn't have a happy ending. Batman is being blamed for a series of highprofile murders in Gotham and the police quickly turn against him. In reality the Phantasm is the one killing the mobsters. Andrea Bruce's former love flies into Gotham weeks after the murders begin.She triggers several flashbacks throughout the story that show us the events that led to Bruce becoming Batman. This includes the incredibly sad movement that prompts Bruce to don the cowl. Alfred's shocked gasp of My God . . . says it all.This is a continuation of the famous BTAS Batman the Animated Series of the 1990's. Many fans consider it to be the definitive version of Batman. Kevin Conroy is THE voice of Batman.The series was widely praised for its thematic complexity darker tone artistic quality and modernization of its title character's crimefighting origins. IGN listed The Animated Series as the best adaptation of Batman anywhere outside of comics the best comic book cartoon of all time and the second best animated series of all time after The Simpsons. Wizard magazine also ranked it 2 of the greatest animated television shows of all time again after The Simpsons. TV Guide ranked it the seventh Greatest Cartoon of All Time out of 60. The universal acclaim led the series to win four Emmy Awards including Outstanding Animated Program.";

In many ways it was way ahead of its time daring to be surprisingly gritty and solemn in way in which no other Batman film Not even those directed by Tim Burton was before.The animation is dark and brooding the characters are fleshed out and complex and the plot is very deep and compelling. The viewer is given a true insight into the troubled psyche of Batman the archetypal Byronic hero and the continuous tribulations that afflict his life as a superhero from his complicated relationship with Andrea to his inner conflicts with his level of responsibility and his uncertainty that arises from it.One scene in particular  in which Bruce kneels at his parents' grave and begs them to let him live his own life  gets me a tad choked up every time I see it. This is powerful serious drama as any Batman story should be.Batman Mask of the Phantasm is a fantastic film which I highly recommend to any fan of Batman the DCAU and animation in general.".

Each episode or couple of episodes acts as its own minimovie. The structuring of the story in each one is just so well executed. As well the animation for its time was quite good and still holds up well enough today. Another difference from other animation is that the color palette is quite dark which again only makes it more interesting. All of the great villains are here and others you may not have heard of but they get a very serious and at times philosophical explication. One of my favorite things about the series is that every episode has its own orchestral score meaning the music that you hear is tailored to fit the exact moment you are watching. Shirley Walker manages to come up with so many subthemes and variations on the main theme and works them in so well with the happenings on screen. For those of you that have seen the series and remember it fondly you might be interested to know that a boxset of the first 28 episodes was recently released you can get it just about anywhere.".

This is a great movie because it doesn't really reference the show even to make the audience confused as to what is going on. Then again I guess everyone is so familiar with the Batman mythology there's probably no reason to do that anyway. The best thing about this is the fantastic animation. It makes me miss the days where every beloved animated show got a theatrically released movie based on it but now most TV shows haven't switched to CGI like movies. It's easily the best movie I've seen for Superhero Month. Another great thing is how well this film works as an origin story.True it doesn't show Batman's direct origin but we get to see through flashbacks a gradual change that makes Bruce Wayne don the costume. It's great to see him actually propose to someone although we all know it didn't work out. I had in fact heard of the twist ending but it's still tons of fun to watch. It truly did remind me of the classic Max Fleischer superhero cartoons and how beautifully animated they were although they did stuff with Superman not Batman. My only complaint is that the movie is too short! It was so epic I wanted to see more! Still it's definitely worth your time and probably my second favorite Batman movie next to The Dark Knight. 12".

	schema:reviewBody "Bioshock's iconic opening was surely inspired by that of the one in Batman Mask of the Phantasm. They both use the same Futurist steeped sleek Art Deco style which inspire the towering structures of the city and swoop in out and between the 3D models to establish their mood and atmosphere. The film is from a time when animation was getting more and more comfortable with these types of three dimensional sequences which turn the traditionally flat canvas into a visual playground think Quasimodo swinging around the bell towers of Notre Dame like Spiderman or the iconic chandelier shot in Beauty and the Beast. It's an altogether more classical rendition of Gotham City and its inhabitants cobbling together various anachronistic elements to resemble something of a neonoir steel arches fedoras figures ripped straight from Edward Hopper's Nighthawks shameless womanisers bikers with chains and bats and the long halls and longer shadows of Wayne Manor. This is a far cry from the recent realist depictions of Nolan's Batman trilogy which evoked a frantic terrorstricken post911 atmosphere in a setting far larger than what a simple animated figure could cover in one night. Nolan's Gotham has slums within slums and cities within cities indulging in panoramic widescreen IMAX shots and reflect a reality where the enemy isn't merely thugs with guns but larger sociopolitical and economical structures. It is worlds away from the moralities that Phantasm initially implies in its art stark boldly lined clearly drawn. Like a true good old fashioned noir the story dives almost immediately and often into flashbacks that dole out the backstory. The film avoids the usual familiar territory that has been etched out in previous cinematic adaptations but also effectively revisits the mythos of Batman and the fear surrounding the dark knight that makes him such a fan favourite. Early on in his crimefighting career Bruce juggles intimidation tactics and the conflict between the streets and the empty family home  never before has a cinematic Batman skipped the double murder in the alley and instead shown a torn Bruce Wayne bargaining at his parent's grave struggling to reconcile his promise to clean up Gotham's grime and his desire for romance and a normal life. When he proposes to Andrea he gets more than a telling sign an ominous column of bats curling and fluttering into the sky like the first ever bat signal. The ending suggests more of the same that Bruce Wayne and Batman are two separate entities that only one of them can truly exist in more than empty shape and form and that other figures have also experienced similar tragedies and conflicts. The true success of Phantasm is being able to tie these difficult questions into what the caped crusader is truly beloved for a hammy superhero with an entire arsenal of gadgets and gizmos who fully embraces what he is. The Batman figure has always been a little bit ridiculous  why not go with it? What will endless vengeance solve? It's a good question for an adult in a bat costume but aside from trying to answer it there's also classical action taken straight from the animated series and the comic books they are based on with the type of hits and blows where you can almost visualise the outlines of the 'KAPOW' on the screen. The set pieces are appropriate the huge full moon illuminating the city and the Batman and his archrival posed like giants as they battle in the model future world exhibit. Mark Hamill is the voice behind the excellent Joker who might be the only supervillain able to make brandishing an electric mixer even remotely menacing. With his wide grimaces and infamous cackle Hamill turns any fight sequence into a heightened battle of the wits alternating oneliners and swinging fists. Shirley Walker's brass heavy theme is reminiscent of Danny Elfman's from the Burton movie retaining most of its grandiose darkness and mystery as the opening surveys the city skyline. And Kevin Conroy's steely tones are worthy of being included in the best of the onscreen Batman portrayals. He's just formidable unwavering  until he is confronted with a glimpse of a second chance at a different life.".

	schema:reviewBody "Well if you've seen The Animated Series this shows pretty much all the positives of it. Think of the best episodes from the show and what comes to mind? TwoFace Part 1? Perchance to Dream? It's Never Too Late? While I wouldn't say this movie is as good as those episodes it comes very close. If you're a fan of the series like me you'll enjoy it. I liked the story the new characters the twists etc... but I have two problems that keep this from being as good as Under the Red Hood or Batman Year One.Problem one how does The Phantasm teleport? Obviously The Phantasm is supposed to be a ghostlike figure but he's able to teleport seemingly at will even bullets and sharp objects pass right through him. They don't bounce off or anything. Now this wouldn't be a huge concern if The Phantasm was a ghost but he isn't so how does stuff phase through him? It's never explained and it seems kind of random that they wouldn't write in a reason.Problem two what happened to Joker at the end? So it turns out that Joker was a gangster that killed The Phantasm's dad years ago and now The Phantasm wants to kill him. So during the climax The Phantasm grabs Joker and disappears in a cloud of smoke. We see what happens to The Phantasm after the climax but what happened to Joker? Did he get away? Did The Phantasm let him go? Did the whole thing just not happen? It's never explained. You'd think with a character as iconic as Joker they'd have a solid conclusion for him in the movie. Maybe it was supposed to be left open to interpretation but it comes off as more lazy to me than anything. And don't tell me he's dead he shows up later in the series.In the end even though I had some problems with it the movie is essentially an extended episode of the show and that's cool. While I still prefer episodes like Feat of Clay Part 2 and Heart of Steel Parts 1  2 over it it's not hard to sit through and pretty enjoyable.".

The people who make this historic series they were put to made a movie based on the series in order to create demand and profit from the love that children and surprisingly adult show towards it. The production was done in a hurry and lasted only eight months and in Christmas on 1993 it open and flop making only 55 million against a budget of 6.I though that like the rest of the animated superhero before 2004 movies this also was made for television or sold in video form and when I discovered the fact that had a theatrical release then my respect for it went up. In my point of view this is one of the best Batman interpretations and the story the mystery the characters work very well and it is an entertaining movie which kids and adults can enjoy. So here comes the question why did it go so bad?? The answer not many went to see it I know is inconceivable but those things can occur if you do not make our product known to the public. The Warner Brothers market it for only two weeks before its opening week and remember is 1993 and the internet exist but is far from the omega high way of information we all know  and this had as a result many never either learn about it only months or years later when a lot of people rent or buy it of rent shores!!! The saddest part is not that a good Batman movie was overlooked and for a time everyone though that Batman would not be taken seriously after the Schumaker versions came out lets not talk much about them their are maximum awful but animated superhero films never really took of like their live action counterparts. The reason for that is that after this economic fail studios in general stopped investing to them and it does seem that this trend continues because apart from the Incredibles that came out in 2004 and Big Hero 6 in 2014 animated capes and cowls are few and far in between.With the sequel to the Incredibles coming out in 2017 in hope that more movies like that are going to be made and now more than twenty years later I believe that studios have learn their lesson. It speaks for itself the fact that we know about Incredibles 2 a year before it came out. So go want this movie and if you want a second opinion trust me has quite a cult following so is not to difficult to find a person to say to you that is good. Have fun .".

I just really don't care about Batman Forever decent but nothing special and its miserable punish franchise killer Batman and Robin anymore.Mask of the Phantasm is basically what I truly loved the animated series. It is Very Very dark story toneddown humor and comedy and most of all The Clown Prince of Crime and The Phantasm which I've never read or heard of in any of the 80's or 90's variations of Batman andor Frank Miller's graphic novel Batman Year One. And I just saying that in a comic nerd's standpoint is that the original cast from the show just nailed it and lend their voices into the big screen.It sucks that this film flopped at the box office despite Warner Bros. Was supposed to release the movie on home video but decided to hand it over to a sorta blockbuster movie but that didn't work as planned and the film as of today still has legions of Batfans everywhere who didn't see the movie.It's a mustown movie. I probably wished it was a new episode of Batman The Animated Series but kudos to the people whoever made this movie. If it's on Netflix then I probably watch it right this instant.".

Equal time is spent with the present day mystery of the Phantasm and Bruce's early experiments with vigilante justice. It's great to see Bruce Wayne get equal focus in the story and in many ways the scenes with him out of costume are the most interesting and pivotal to the story. The Joker plays a crucial part in the plot and a woman is introduced who had a powerful influence on Bruce's decision to become Batman. What more could the true Batman fan ask for? Mask of the Phantasm is worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as The Dark Knight and Batman Returns. There's a classic story within its animated trappings.".

	schema:reviewBody "THIS POST MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS Although it was 5 years after the series ended and WB was currently working on Justice League this animated movie is a welcome addition to the video library. Why? Well if Mask of the Phantasm compliments the first 70 episodes of Batman The Animated Series and SubZero compliments the 15 episodes of the Adventures of Batman and Robin then Mystery of the Batwoman compliments the final 24 episodes of the Gotham Knights version of Batman. Kevin Conroy once again delivers a voice over performance that is nothing short of excellence and perfection. I admit I was a bit leery when I heard about Batwoman and all I could think about were the old 50's comics of Batman. But I was blown away by the Batwoman character her look her costume which I assumed inspired Bruce Wayne to create the costume on Batman Beyondand the fact that this movie keeps you guessing who Batwoman is all the way through. If you want to know who Batwoman is then buy or rent the DVD. Barbara Gordon makes a cameo appearance and I think the writers were trying to hint that Bruce and Barbara had something going on between them like they did in Batman Beyond. Tim Drake appears as Robin but his role is a small one and sadly there is no sign of or mention of Dick Grayson alias Nightwing which leads me to believe he has established himself in Bludhaven his city in the comics.Of the three suspects for Batwoman my favorite is Kathy Duquesne who looks an awful lot like Halle Berry. Kelly Ripa did a great job as one of the other suspects. When it comes to the villains I'm glad the Penguin was one of them but I did not like the fact that they replaced Paul Williams with David Ogden Stiers. Pengy just didn't sound right. Same thing goes for Robin. The new guy did okay but just as I was starting to get used to Matt Valencia they replaced him. It's interesting to note that Kevin Michael Richardson who voices Carlton Duquesne is now the voice of the Joker in The Batman series. And we finally see what Rupert Thorne looks like revamped since he didn't show up in the Gotham Knights episodes. The late John Vernon will be missed. Although I enjoyed Henry Silva as the voice of Bane if he had to be replaced they got the right man in the form of Hector Elizondo. I only wish they could have used Two Face Riddler or the scary new version of the Scarecrow.The musical score and especially the soft sounding intro were superb. I wish that was on a soundtrack and I especially enjoyed the beautiful and talented Cherie in the Iceberg Lounge along with her song Betcha Neva. While some feel that this movie is weaker than the Mask of the Phantasm and Subzero I find it just as strong and enjoyable as the rest plus like I said earlier it's a full length movie based off the Gotham Knights version of Batman which I think gives a good balance. I would at least recommend renting this DVD first before buying it for those who might be leery of this movie but personally it's well worth the purchase. I give Mystery of the Batwoman a 9.".

	schema:reviewBody "Batman The Mystery of the Batwoman is about as entertaining as animated Batman movies get.While still true to the feeling of the comic books the animation is done with a lighter spirit than in the animated series. Bruce Wayne looks much like he has before but now he appears somewhat less imposing. The Dick Grayson Robin has been replaced by the less edgy more youthful Tim Drake Robin.Kevin Conroy as usual invokes the voice of Batman better than most live action actors.Kelly Ripa did a much more decent voiceacting job than I was expecting.As in the live action Batman films the movie lives or dies based on the quality of the villains. My alltime favorite the Penguin is here. His design is sleeker than it has appeared before hearkening more to the Burgess Meredith portrayal of the '60's than the Danny DeVito portrayal of Batman Returns. David Ogden Stiers is the perfect choice for the Penguin's voice. The Penguin is finally portrayed as a cunning sophisticate just as he most commonly appears in the comics. Hector Elizondo's voice creates a Bane who's much more memorable than the forgettable version in Batman  Robin. And finally Batman has a descent mystery to solve putting the Detective back in Detective Comics that is what DC stands for after all. The revolution to the mystery is a delightfully sneaky twist.The score adds to the mysterious ambiance of the movie. It sounds like a mix between the score from Poirot and the score from Mission Impossible. All in all it's more entertaining than your average cartoon.".

	schema:reviewBody "It aired on TV yesterday so I decided to check it out. This was one of the last Bruce TimmPaul Dini DTV projects related to their old 1992 Batman the Animated Series after that Jeff Matsuda came along and reimagined Batman with his new The Batman series but anyway the story of this new Batman movie centers around the appearance of a new vigilante known as Batwoman however Batman feels the need to stop her because of her extreme methods and also in the meantime take down The Pengiun and Ruphert Thorn who both are secretly working with Carlton Duquesnewho's having family troubles and another villainwhich is later revealed in the movie on a weapons smuggling operationthey also put a bounty on the Batwoman. The question is who is this mysterious Batwoman and is it possible that they could be more then one? It's up to Batman to solve this mystery and stop Penguin's latest operation. For an animated movie it has a fairly complex plot and a serious tone which is good. Another plus was the complete redesign of the Penguin who looks much more like the sophisticated Mob Boss we're used to seeing in the comics unlike his previous designs that borrowed elements from Tim Burton vision of Pengiumsewer rat and circus freak. Even though the movie contains a love subplot it's never carried that far and doesn't derail the movie like say Batman Forever. The voice acting is standard quality for these directtovideo projectsif only Batman Mask of Phantasm took this route Kevin Conroy still shines as BatmanBruce Wayne. And like I said despite running for some very short 80 minutes it manages to make a pretty goodand complex storyline complete with a few minor twists and bucket loads of action. There are a few downsides however Nightwing is nowhere to be seen and I'm sure Barbara Gordon and Bruce Wayne don't click as a couple even though is just referenced Tim Drakeaka Robin does very little in the movie and to be quite frank I was never a big fan of Paul Dini and Bruce Timm's Batman character designespecially in their Batman shows postBTAS this The New Adventures of Batman and Robin well it kinda makes Batman look fat then rather a wellbuilt bulked up individualkinda like the Jeff Matsuda character model from The Batman. Bruce Wayne seems a bit awkward those blue eyes make him look more like Clark Kent then Brucethough it's true they do look very much alike. Another downside is Rupert Throneno explanation as to why he is in this deal but it's safe to say he's has goons and what's a cut of the deal which does very little more then hang out with the Penguim or get himself hurt every time he points a gun at someonecount how many times this happens in the movie and you'll be surprised. Overall a good Batman animated movie worth at least a rental.".

Still it is very good and there's not really much to complain about in the character designs. Some fans as I'm well aware of criticize the The New Batman Adventures but consider this movie for example. Bane looks great and though the voice actor is Hctor Elizondo instead of the usual Henry Silva the character retains the same intelligence and prideful personality as in the comics. Penguin's design changes drastically from the original Batman The Animated Series design now free of the Danny DeVito look and being pretty awesome in the movie. John Vernon reprises the role of Rupert Throne though he does little in the movie to my distaste. Then of course there's Batwoman and I can't reveal too much but she is a badass character. There's less focus on Batman in this one you could say but it's in order to allow the audience to explore new characters and this is done very well.Lolita Ritmanis a regular composer from the show does the music for this film and while I find it okay it's a tad much of a departure from the usual darker music. Still all in all Mystery of the Batwoman has complex characters great animation and an intriguing storyline that delivers action and mystery. I definitely recommend it.".

The music is full of haunting atmosphere too and never feels out of place while the writing is sharp and provokes thought and the story even with the filler has great suspense a sense of mystery and some exciting action. Batman is still the dark and brooding character we know and love and Penguin who's always been one of my favourite Batman villains is a delight to see. The voice acting is terrific Kevin Conroy can do no wrong and Kelly Rippa is also surprisingly good. David Ogden Stiers may have inevitable comparisons to Paul Williams but I think he does do a more than worthy job with Penguin's voice. All in all a very good movie while not the strongest Batman animated movie it is hardly bad either. 810 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "For starters I have always been a fan of the Batman cartoons because the theme is so universal 'that everyone alive has an alterego'. This is true in the Mystery of Batwoman. While the overall story is good I'm disappointed that they haven't really done much for the franchise with this.Throughout the movie you are trying to find out who the identity of Batwoman is unfortunately you can find out by easily looking at the cast of credits posted on this website so if you haven't seen it already don't go there. I was sort of disappointed that they didn't make the movie longer. 75 minutes is way too short for any movie. The secret identity of batwoman also comes far too early in the movie sort of midway and becomes anticlimatic afterward because you know the good guys will always win and that the new character known as Batwoman will disappear after the movie is over.I'm also not too sure about the new animation style used in this movie. I love the sleek new characters but there should be some more detail where detail is called for. Some parts of the animation look so awkward and rigid that it grabs your attention right away diverting your attention away from the storyline. I also didn't really like the bright atmosphere used in most of the scenes it sort of loses its dark and gothic feel which is Batman. Similarly we should've gotten to know more about batwoman's personality so that we can build the same deep compassionate feeling that we do with Bruce Wayne. Also I think the fight with Bane should have been done better. In typical children's fashion the bad guy meets his demise too easily either by tripping falling getting electricuted or doing something dumb that works against them. Come to think of it there wasn't even one drop of blood spilled in this movie either.Bottom line its a good entertaining flick and I recommend anyone who's a Batman fan to watch it. It has good storyline universal appeal and even great acting to top it off. I just wish that they could have delivered more permanent change to the story by making Batwoman stay to make things more interesting. Not just introduce her and then kick her off once she's done. I'd also like to see someone else figure out the mystery for a change finally. To have some other than Batman solve the mystery and fill him in later with the details.I hope there are more animated movies to come and look forward to the time when we will actually be able to see the breakup between Bruce Wayne and Barbra Gordan. He's been stringing her along forever and doesn't even like her and I can't believe that she was dumb enough to fall in love with someone 20 years older. I also want to see the time when Tim Drake leaves because he is getting sick of the old man. In short I want to see all of the things that led the characters to where they will be in Batman Beyond. Otherwise the same repeated formula will just end it faster than if they just decided to move on with the story.".

But it is still good animation to watch and i do like the design of Batwoman but different to the comics and i love addition of the Glider such a cool addition for Batwoman which wasnt even in the comics.The Voice acting in this one is amazing Kevin Conroy again voices Batman and this guy just is Batman such an iconic voice and always brings back nostalgia when i hear it and watch is version of Batman.I also think there was no reason to have Robin in this story he dosent really do anything and we only see him in the suit towards the end when we see them fighting Bane and his men and at this point Batwoman is already helping Batman i think this would of been a better story if it was personal to Batman.Verdict 710 pretty good batman story but sometimes feels abit convoluted and would of worked better if it was a personal story for Batman".

	schema:reviewBody "Like most of the other films set in the universe of 'Batman The Animated Series 1992' 'Batman Mystery Of The Batwoman 2003' comes across as more of an extension of the specific show on which it is based 'The New Batman Adventures 1997' than a standalone feature. As such it doesn't spend time setting up its preexisting characters or world jumping straight into the action as if it is an extended episode of the series. Yet unlike some previous animated adventures this entry does a good job at feeling fairly cinematic without any 'commercial breaks' or an odd 'cliffhanger'centric structure and will be recognisable to anyone familiar with any incarnation of the Bat and his friends. It isn't as cinematic as 'Batman Mask Of The Phantasm 1992' but it's more cinematic than 'Batman  Mr. Freeze Subzero 1998'. The flick favours its eponymous mystery above almost all else giving 'the world's greatest detective'  and the audience  some decent detective work to do instead of just resorting to fullout fisticuffs. The enigma is believable intriguing and satisfying once it is eventually resolved. There's also a fair bit of action though. All of it is impressively animated and sometimes pretty painful. The best thing about the piece is that the Dark Knight is constantly at the centre of a story with characters that have proper motives and arcs that pay off pretty nicely. Each player feels like they have a reason to act as they do which is refreshing because noone feels like a cartoon character. The piece is as engaging as it is entertaining a fun adventure with an interesting mystery at its heart and it serves as a nice 'farewell' to this particular 'universe' too. 710".

	schema:headline " Geez Leweez its a woman. I love this Movie!";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie is very nostalgiac to me and my siblings and we try to watch it whenever we can because we love it so much however i will try to be unbias in this review. First this movie is AWESOME! During the period of the first straight to DVD batman movies each one was created to be vastly entertaining memorable and close to perfection. This movie uses the batman 4th season art which is more smoother than the first season and i think it helps the animation to be way more fluid in this movie. Batman is still played by the amazing Kevin Conroy and tim drake is the robin in this film i always kind of saw them as brothers just based on their dialogue. Bat woman is awesome! shes played by kyra sedgewick has a great design  Always did like the silver instead of red and black and is hilariously snarky and witty. Batmans asks her  who are you why are you doing this? her response ' your the great detective figure it out! i love all her lines. The best part is the mysterybatman actually has a hard time and is given 3 very probable suspects the first is the new latina detective on the force named Soniathe second is the clumsy but cool scientistrocky and last is the snarky halle berry clone Kathy who is the daughter of one of the villains and actually starts a interesting relationship with batman. Batman is a player! Each has great motivations to be bat woman and batman spends time watching each of them. And then the greatest plot twist I've seen in all of batman  except the joker reveal is that bat woman is all 3 of them at separate times! That still kind of blows me away. The villains are a now legal penguin who has a very classy iceberg lounge now  one day i would love to have my own lounge like it but still secretly does illegal things. There are 2 mob bosses one is Kathy's father and is played Kevin Micheal Richardson and the other is Rupert thorne  who i didn't find too interesting but after watching him in the original series i like him more and they hire bane to fight bat woman his voice is really good in this version i tried to make my own Spanish accent sound like his a couple of times. The fights are jaw dropping the final fight between batman and bane at the end is far better than the one in rise of the dark night. i didn't really like that batman is trying to stop bat woman simply because shes a vigilante after all hes one too even though he works with the police and she is a far more brutal vigilante...i guess i made my point. The music has this spy like theme and is kind of jazzy which makes me feel like this is in the 20's or something but is very likable and whats probably the best song I've ever heard in an animated movie is a underrated song called Betcha Neva by Cherie who is shown singing it in penguins lounge my siblings and i would watch that scene and the end credits a hundred times because its just that good and is very nostalgic for us now. i am well aware many people think this movie could have been just an episode but i disagree this movie not only has a very mature and involving plot but you seriously cant tell who bat woman is because she has a separate voice from the other women she even maintains a single personality throughout the animation is wonderful the soundtrack i adore the dialogue is wittyand most importantly as a kid this movie helped me to learn to respect nonsuper powered women and see that they are equally capable of being badass for a cartoon meant for boys this is a very valuable lesson. if this isn't reason enough to buy this movie there is a bonus episodemusic video called Chase me starring cat woman and batman with this really jazzy music that you will just love. This is my 3 favorite batman movie and i recommend everyone to watch it.".

	onyx:emotionText "This movie is very nostalgiac to me and my siblings and we try to watch it whenever we can because we love it so much however i will try to be unbias in this review. First this movie is AWESOME! During the period of the first straight to DVD batman movies each one was created to be vastly entertaining memorable and close to perfection. This movie uses the batman 4th season art which is more smoother than the first season and i think it helps the animation to be way more fluid in this movie. Batman is still played by the amazing Kevin Conroy and tim drake is the robin in this film i always kind of saw them as brothers just based on their dialogue. Bat woman is awesome! shes played by kyra sedgewick has a great design  Always did like the silver instead of red and black and is hilariously snarky and witty. Batmans asks her  who are you why are you doing this? her response ' your the great detective figure it out! i love all her lines. The best part is the mysterybatman actually has a hard time and is given 3 very probable suspects the first is the new latina detective on the force named Soniathe second is the clumsy but cool scientistrocky and last is the snarky halle berry clone Kathy who is the daughter of one of the villains and actually starts a interesting relationship with batman. Batman is a player! Each has great motivations to be bat woman and batman spends time watching each of them. And then the greatest plot twist I've seen in all of batman  except the joker reveal is that bat woman is all 3 of them at separate times! That still kind of blows me away. The villains are a now legal penguin who has a very classy iceberg lounge now  one day i would love to have my own lounge like it but still secretly does illegal things. There are 2 mob bosses one is Kathy's father and is played Kevin Micheal Richardson and the other is Rupert thorne  who i didn't find too interesting but after watching him in the original series i like him more and they hire bane to fight bat woman his voice is really good in this version i tried to make my own Spanish accent sound like his a couple of times. The fights are jaw dropping the final fight between batman and bane at the end is far better than the one in rise of the dark night. i didn't really like that batman is trying to stop bat woman simply because shes a vigilante after all hes one too even though he works with the police and she is a far more brutal vigilante...i guess i made my point. The music has this spy like theme and is kind of jazzy which makes me feel like this is in the 20's or something but is very likable and whats probably the best song I've ever heard in an animated movie is a underrated song called Betcha Neva by Cherie who is shown singing it in penguins lounge my siblings and i would watch that scene and the end credits a hundred times because its just that good and is very nostalgic for us now. i am well aware many people think this movie could have been just an episode but i disagree this movie not only has a very mature and involving plot but you seriously cant tell who bat woman is because she has a separate voice from the other women she even maintains a single personality throughout the animation is wonderful the soundtrack i adore the dialogue is wittyand most importantly as a kid this movie helped me to learn to respect nonsuper powered women and see that they are equally capable of being badass for a cartoon meant for boys this is a very valuable lesson. if this isn't reason enough to buy this movie there is a bonus episodemusic video called Chase me starring cat woman and batman with this really jazzy music that you will just love. This is my 3 favorite batman movie and i recommend everyone to watch it.";

	schema:reviewBody "Batman Mistery of the Batwoman isn't a bad film not bad at all but it is nowhere near the lever of Batman The Mask of the Phantasm and Batman Beyond The Return of the Joker. Despite that as for animated films of the DCAU goes it is decent entry but it came out in 2003 when this animation was becoming obsolete and so it didn't receive great reviews. The story is an interesting one in Gotham a new Heroine comes out and calls herself Batwoman and she is going after two of the most famous crime bosses in Gotham the Penguin as well as Rupert Thorne. The issue is that this emulator of the Dark Knihgt is more ruthless than Bats and it is up to the dynamic duo of Batman and Robin to find out what is her identity and why she is targeting those two gangsters.So the story is fine the fight scenes cool now where is it lacking?It lacks a bit to the emotional connection that Batman The Mask of the Phantasm and Batman Beyond The Return of the Joker had. Also an other issue is the tone it is too light for a Batman film. Now I know that it isn't necessary to have it all dark and depressing but it doesn't needs to become that the two previous animated mentions and the 1989 live action film I won't compare with the Nolan versions because they weren't release yet so it better to use as measure Batman films that were made up to 2003 were darker in tone but also had a lot of dialogues and scenes with fun excitement and delight!Also and this my take the animation though well made it is dated by toady's standards and even for the 2003 levels. If the flick had come out before the millennium it would have been praised but after the millennium with series like Justice League Teen Titans and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2003 the levels had went up. In short the market demands were a bit to high for it!In general it is a OK Batman film and if you are a fan of the Cape Crusader I recommended you to added in your collection of Batman films if you haven't already! To the rest give a try and if you don't like it it is OK.".

	schema:reviewBody "Even though the identity of Batwoman is pretty obvious the story and action make up for it. I'm not sure why they waited til after The New Batman Adventures ended to make a movie with it. Maybe because unlike Batman Beyond or Batman The Animated Series it had less than 30 episodes so they weren't as concerned with it as say Mask of the Phantasm or Return of the Joker. Regardless the action's really well animated and fluid the plot's good and it all adds up to an entertaining watch. I only have a few negatives with the movie though believe me the good outweighs the bad but I still have to address these.One what was the point of Barbara being in the movie? She only has like 4 lines of dialogue and never shows up in the movie besides this. Was it for fan service or something? I know it's such a small thing to complain about but it kind of irked me. Two why was Tim downplayed in this? Again another minor thing but as a guy that actually loved Tim Drake as Robin in the show I thought he'd have a bigger role in this. Then again it's more centered around this new character in Batwoman so I guess it made sense for him to have a smaller supporting role. Three the twist of Batwoman's identity being three people. It's a good idea but once you realize that the characters are exclusive only to this movie it makes it pretty obvious. Oh hey these three women that have never been in any episodes of the show before are suddenly here. I wonder who Batwoman's likely to be? Granted it's not as obvious as say Mask of the Phantasm and they at least changed it up by having it be three people.Despite the negatives which are admittedly really easy to ignore the movie's really good. I hate to nitpick like this about a 75 minute animated movie but like I said the negatives are easy to look over. It's all just a matter of perspective I suppose. I don't like it as much as Under the Red Hood or Year One but it's still very entertaining.".

It's structure is much more intricate much more solid than that of Return of the Joker and it's intrigue can delight children and adults alike. The story as some might know revolves around a new BatFigure and it's up to old Bats to find out who she is and what she wants. The way the plot unwinds will surprise kids and might even confuse some adults. The outcome is quite unexpected but not in the semifantasy caliber that Return of the Joker tried to pull off. All of the known casts reprise their roles and do a superb job. We actually get to see Bruce Wayne conflicted about his morality a bit due to his playboy lifestyle. This is expertly executed by director Curt Geda who never crossed the line that would make this title more visceral that it should ever be. The animation and design is awesome as it is to be expected of any older DC feature film. Batwoman's design is a bit bothering at times it's just illogical overall but it's not that big of a gripe. Mystery of the Batwoman is one of the best DC animated movies and I dare rank it just below Mask of the Phantasm. Batfan animation fan random kid or adult  you are guaranteed to enjoy this film.".

This isn't a bad thing though it contains a lot of the quirkyness of some of the more lighthearted episodes a lot of which were brilliant while still having a lot of content that adults could enjoy as well.The animation for this one is superb it really shines through particularly on facial expressions and even the explosions look great. The mystery had me guessing for the good first 23s of the movie but in the end once it's all revealed the motives seem a little hazy and while I did enjoy the several love interests happening at once it did seem a little unnecessary and the very ending seemed a tad off. The music was great but the Quentin Tarantinoesc credit scene was a little out of place. All in all a good movie7 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "Bat Pussy 1973 BOMB out of 4 A married redneck couple are in bed trying to perform oral sex on one another while at the same time screaming insults. The husband wants his wife to reenact pictures in his Screw magazine. After nonstop fighting Bat Pussy eventually shows up after riding her bouncing ball and joins the action.I'm giving BAT PUSSY a BOMB rating because on every technical level imaginable it's a horribly made movie. There's really not a single good thing that can be said about it but that doesn't mean you shouldn't watch it. In fact this is a very rare example of where a film's awful reputation actually lives up to the hype. Yes BAT PUSSY is without question one of the worst films ever made and it's perhaps the most pathetic porno ever made but that's just part of the entertainment.You can read up on the actual film but not too much is known about it. Apparently a print of it turned up in a Memphis porn theater and was eventually sold to the great folks at Something Weird Video. They released it and sure enough with a title like BAT PUSSY it became a huge hit and has gained a pretty strong cult following over the years. It's easy to see why because this is just one downright insane and totally messed up film.The white trash couple just has to be seen to be believed. I can't help but think that they're actually related in some way and the strangest thing about their sex scenes is that not much ever happens. There's a lot of oral sex but for some reason no actual sex. The entire scene is just the two people cussing each other out calling each other names and throwing one insult after another.

	onyx:emotionText "Bat Pussy 1973 BOMB out of 4 A married redneck couple are in bed trying to perform oral sex on one another while at the same time screaming insults. The husband wants his wife to reenact pictures in his Screw magazine. After nonstop fighting Bat Pussy eventually shows up after riding her bouncing ball and joins the action.I'm giving BAT PUSSY a BOMB rating because on every technical level imaginable it's a horribly made movie. There's really not a single good thing that can be said about it but that doesn't mean you shouldn't watch it. In fact this is a very rare example of where a film's awful reputation actually lives up to the hype. Yes BAT PUSSY is without question one of the worst films ever made and it's perhaps the most pathetic porno ever made but that's just part of the entertainment.You can read up on the actual film but not too much is known about it. Apparently a print of it turned up in a Memphis porn theater and was eventually sold to the great folks at Something Weird Video. They released it and sure enough with a title like BAT PUSSY it became a huge hit and has gained a pretty strong cult following over the years. It's easy to see why because this is just one downright insane and totally messed up film.The white trash couple just has to be seen to be believed. I can't help but think that they're actually related in some way and the strangest thing about their sex scenes is that not much ever happens. There's a lot of oral sex but for some reason no actual sex. The entire scene is just the two people cussing each other out calling each other names and throwing one insult after another. When Bat Pussy joins the action there's just more oral sex and more insults. Why wasn't there any sex? I have no idea what was going on.There weren't any credits so no one knows who these people are or who directed it. It seems the dialogue was just being made up on the spot as they went along.

And anyone who had anything at all to do with it deserves a kick in the ass. But whatever. That was hilarious! NowI'm not sure this was meant to be THAT ridiculous. because self aware Bmovies isn't really something that we saw too much way back in the early 70's. Which only leads me to one conclusion. Everyone was on something. And a lot of it. Most likely alcohol. Otherwise you'd think it woulda at least occurred to someone they this project shoulda been aborted. Cuz it clearly wasn't working... Or was it.So what we have here is an extremely unnatractive middleaged married couple taking turns making pathetic attempts at performing oral sex on each other while one berates the other. And that's pretty much it. And obviously our fine cast was also a bit tipsy. Tipsy enough to not be in the mood. or maybe they just weren't that into each other Yeah. Thsat's probably it. And then there was Bat Pussy. she's... I don't know what the hell's going' on there. Just an incredibly sad attempt at parodying s duper hero. At some point in the movie Bat Pussy rides her bouncy ball across Gotham City all the way to the love nest of the unfortunate married couple only to get plowed by the still limp husband while the ugly wife bitches about it. She eventually joins in but nothing comes of it. It's probably for the best.So like I said. Wow! This certainly wouldn't be fit for someone who's lookin' for an even remotely decent porno but if you're lookin' for a so bad it's good type film that makes absolutely no sense you just might find it worthy of a watch. If not hilarious. Just don't forget the alcohol! 210".

If you're down with nude drunken hillbillies manhandling each other for ten minute intervals cussing and insulting one another you are in for a real treat. I haven't heard so many ridiculous obscene redneck insults since my last family reunion out in Nebraska. But the real reason for watching this film is the amazing sequence of Bat Pussy on her way to Gotham City on the hippityhop. Apparently the actress's name is Dora DIldo. Anyway this film is by all intentions I guess a porno in regards to which JeanPaul Sartre the asshole philosopher said Pity the poor wretch who desires masturbation but rents Bat Pussy. True. But I had to struggle hard to keep my hand away from my dick during the hippityhop shots. This is how Bat Pussy travels from Bat Pussy Headquarters to the apartment where the hillbillies are taking nude pictures. She jumps on the HippityHop and bounces along the side of the highway. This is one of the most improbable and bizarre things I have ever seen on film. I was strangely excited by the idea that a woman named Dora DIldo would dress up like a superhero and then bounce around town on a hippityhop. I looked down incredulously and noticed I had a major chubby in my my shorts. I tried to ignore it and then it went away real quick once the film cut back to the hillbillies insulting one another again.A lot of people say this film sucks. Well I can understand that. But have any of those people ever sat through Rumble Fish? or the 2008 film adaptation Get Smart with my most hated actor of all time Steve Carell? THESE films suck. These two films have to be the fcking worst films ever made. Oh my God. Just thinking about them makes me want to kill myself. I was forced through hideous social conventions at Thanksgiving time at a friends' families house to watch Get Smart and I think the people who made this shtty fcking film are literally worse than the Nazis. I am serious. And Rumble Fish? What the fck? Why has no one killed Francis Ford for making that one? God damn. I would rather watch Bat Pussy ten times in a row than have to watch Get Smart again. Bat Pussy provides laughs chubbies disgust entertainment frustration etc. in a way that films made now simply do not. It is bizarre and the budget is basically nonexistent. I think that is a lot better than that piece of sht Get Smart where millions were poured into it I did not laugh once and it just fcking failed on every level. If you like Get Smart then Fck You. I hate you and want you to go away from me far far away. I will be sitting here watching Bat Pussy and praying for your death.".

	schema:headline " Nice chiller starred by flying foxes  fastpaced  and well directed by Morneau";
	schema:reviewBody "Absolutely surprising carnivorous bats tale  derived from abysmal story . The film starts in Skull Valley  Arizona where the scientific Casper Dina Meyer and his assistant Jimmy Leon are investigating about bats . They're brought by a government scientist Bob Gunton to a small town called Callup  in Texas . There appears a pack of carnivorous bats that prey on citizens  terrorizing the small community . The chiroptera specialist Casper  his helper  along with a policeman Lou Diamond Phillips attempt to stop the genetically altered flying foxes before the military comes into action  bombing the caves.This is a slambang chiller about flying foxes  full of scares and lots of blood and gore . It delivers the goods with suspense  tension and hairraising chills  plus  the astonishing special effects of this nature  as the ferocious bats seem alive . It's an eerily effective thriller  quite entertaining  though many will undoubtedly find repulsive when the bats attack and eat their victims . The tale can't bear such close scrutiny  but while this thrills ride is going you won't mind . With a final budget of 5.25 million the film went on to gross well over 30 million worldwide in theatrical  DVD  Digital and Television sales . Although considered somewhat unsuccessful at the time the film recouped its entire budget during its first week of release . The vampire bats are splendidly made by means of Animatronics in charge of Robert Zurtzman  Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger .

	onyx:emotionText "Absolutely surprising carnivorous bats tale  derived from abysmal story . The film starts in Skull Valley  Arizona where the scientific Casper Dina Meyer and his assistant Jimmy Leon are investigating about bats . They're brought by a government scientist Bob Gunton to a small town called Callup  in Texas . There appears a pack of carnivorous bats that prey on citizens  terrorizing the small community . The chiroptera specialist Casper  his helper  along with a policeman Lou Diamond Phillips attempt to stop the genetically altered flying foxes before the military comes into action  bombing the caves.This is a slambang chiller about flying foxes  full of scares and lots of blood and gore . It delivers the goods with suspense  tension and hairraising chills  plus  the astonishing special effects of this nature  as the ferocious bats seem alive . It's an eerily effective thriller  quite entertaining  though many will undoubtedly find repulsive when the bats attack and eat their victims . The tale can't bear such close scrutiny  but while this thrills ride is going you won't mind . With a final budget of 5.25 million the film went on to gross well over 30 million worldwide in theatrical  DVD  Digital and Television sales . Although considered somewhat unsuccessful at the time the film recouped its entire budget during its first week of release . The vampire bats are splendidly made by means of Animatronics in charge of Robert Zurtzman  Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger .

Seeing it that way the movie was good enough to pass the time. No more but I wasn't bored.Certainly there's a lot of the movie that's dumb. Some of the puppets and computer generated effects look really bad. The black character is only there for humor and his treatment is somewhat offensive. Lou Diamond Phillips can't act. Sometimes you can't tell what's going on with all the closeups of flapping wings and bad editing.There are a few good things. Some of the cliches I was expecting actually didn't happen. For one thing the authorities are quick to the danger for once. The cinematography is excellent and occasionally the movie has a big feeling that makes it look more expensive that its 6.5 million budget.So if you like B movies are feeling undemanding and can see it cheaply or for free you might want to give it a try.".

This is your typical creaturefeature about a genetically mutated animalspecies in this case bats duh! that becomes a little TOO intelligent after the experiments performed on them and turns against the creators. And of course the two escaped labbats infect the normal ones and pretty soon an entire Texas town is overcome by millions of carnivorous bats! It's up to zoologist Dina Meyer her dim assistant Leon and sheriff Lou Diamond Phillips to prevent that this plague spreads itself throughout the entire United States. This film has quite a few good aspects going for it but also too many negative ones and the latter make this is a generally unmemorable and lacking horror film. The most important positive element about Bats is that the screenplay doesn't waste any time! There clearly is a batproblem and all the characters immediately acknowledge this. Usually in this type of Bmovies it takes another boring hour or so before everyone accepts that harmless little animals can turn into bloodthirsty monsters. Unfortunately this is where the praising stopsAfter the nononsense opening sequences the film turns into an endless series of dull clichs lousy dialogues bad acting and terrible special effects. In fact there are no special effects! The numerous batattacks exist of wide panshots of the sky but when the critters eventually descend to assault their preys everything becomes all blurry and you can't possibly make out what's happening. It's hard to take the acting leads seriously Dina Meyer as a Doctor?? and Leon's character is just a dreadful stereotype of the petrified and witty assistant who brings some comic relief. Worth watching if you really don't have anything better to do".

Unfortunately he was bad enough to have brought down the whole film.This is fun generates some good suspense and isn't afraid to show you the nemesis. The story itself is quite competent to hold up and does IF you can ignore the wretched performance given by Bob Gunton. I must say that I do not believe it to be wholly his fault as he has given some great performances in the past and since. The fault must lie with the director Louis Morneau who has never done much of note.I like this film and can enjoy it in spite of the doctor and do find myself watching it from time to time.It rates a 6.810 from...the Fiend .".

The scariest part of the film was Bob Gunton's portrayal of the mad scientist who created this race of killer omnivirous Bats. He's identified as working for the Center For Disease Control. I was watching this figuring out how this creep got government clearance.Yet Gunton is the most enjoyable thing in this film. And you got to love the fact that he had all these government facilities to work with he's not hidden away in some laboratory in an old castle the way Karloff and Lugosi used to be. He's bred this race of flying fox bats from Indonesia which are aggressive to begin with and they've taken up residence in a bat cavern in Lou Diamond Phillips's county where he's the sheriff. After several suspicious deaths with mutilation the cause is identified and zoologists Dina Meyer and Leon Robinson are brought in to clean out the bat cave. If you care about how and if they do it by all means watch the film and the hint is think blob.Bats will never go down as a great science fiction classic but it does have a certain campiness to it.

The script by John Logan moves along at a nice pace  is never really boring or overly dull but is stuffed with loads of horror film clichs the stuffy female scientist who starts to loosen up  become romantically involved with the brave hero the annoying obligatory black comic relief character the evil scientist who cares for nothing but his experiments  is finally killed by them the shady Government figure the heavyhanded military who are all gungho  cause almost as many problem's as the bats themselves the disbelieving at first local townspeople  the isolated location. It's all here folks but it's done in a reasonably entertaining way that passes an hour and a half painlessly enough I suppose. The film lacks any real violence or gore apart from an autopsy scene at the start Bats doesn't have enough of the red stuff. The climax where a swarm of bats are chasing our heroes through some mine shafts is fairly decent  manages to create some excitement although I'm not sure two human beings could outrun 1000's of genetically enhanced bigger better  badder than your average bat bats in a straight race...Director Morneau keeps things moving along doesn't spend too much time on silly unnecessary character development  doesn't seem to take it all too seriously. However the bat attacks are annoyingly edited loads of ultra quick cuts so much so that it becomes confusing as to whats happening. Don't expect to see much during these scenes as it really does become a bit of a blur maybe they are presented this way to hide the special effects up? The bats themselves look pretty cool although it's obvious their puppets.With a supposed budget of about 6500000 Bats looks OK  is generally well made but that sounds like a lot of money considering what ended up on screen. The photography music  production values are good if not spectacular while the special effects alternate between CGI  rubber puppets both of which have their fair share of effects that work  effects that don't. The acting was OK but no one stands out except the token black comedy relief guy Leon who becomes highly irritating.Bats isn't the best horror film ever made that's for sure but it's far from the worst either. On a dumb predictable sort of level I thought it was watchable worth a watch for horror fans but others may find it all rather silly  stupid.".

	schema:reviewBody "I think the Oscar race just got a little tighter when Bats was released into the market.  This is clearly one of the best films that has come out this year.  You can forget about the cynicism of American Beauty the brilliance of Fight Club the ingenuity of Three Kings and the mania that is Sixth Sense Bats is set to go down as one of the greats up there with Jaws Patton Rocky Annie Hall and Amadeus.  I think future generations of Hollywood directors and writers are going to turn to BATS to see how it is done.  John Carpenter's Halloween and Spielberg's Jaws used to be the bench mark when it came to horror but this has put a whole new perspective into how to scare someone at the theater.  When I left the theater my knuckles were a ghostly white from gripping the arm rests and when I looked on the ghastly faces of the hundreds of people leaving the theater they all had the same expression.  They were frightened.  The show ended at about midnight and we were all anxious to get into our cars because we were afraid those cunning bats were waiting to get us right outside the theater.  Now that is good film making.  Jaws made me afraid of the ocean I think Bats is going to make me afraid of the night sky.  I have never seen bats that look this real in a movie.  Those fangs were so real looking that most of the budget must have gone into the production of those intricately designed bats.  Fangs eyes and even their hissing sounds were realistic.  What a fantastic film.  If this isn't nominated at Oscar time for best picture and director then I would say that something is up with the academy.  I am still in awe and utter fear as I sit here and write this review of Bats. This is one of the scariest films that I have ever seen. WOW!!!Okay I just had to do it.  I had to.Bats is really one of the worst films to come out this year.  But this is a film that is so easy to rip on that I thought it would be fun to do the exact opposite and just confuse the hell out of the readers for a minute or so.  The only award this may be winning this year is the Raspberry awards. But you know what?  Going into this film I was expecting a really really really bad film.  I only got a bad one so that was unexpected and a nice surprise.  I think I like most other horror movie nuts enjoy a good bad horror flick at times.  There is just something about cheese that is fun at times.  And for that reason Bats delivers.  Everything you have heard about the film is true.  It is all bad.  The bats are laughable the story is a joke and the writing is awful even the commercials looked pretty bad.  But there is one good thing going for it and that is that it had a subtle homage to Jaws in it.  The guy that first gets killed at the beginning is named Quint and when they do an autopsy on him it wreaked of Hoopers little angry deposition in Jaws when he tells them that it wasn't a boating accident.  And if you can pick up on little subtleties like that then the film is more fun.  Really this isn't all that bad I mean it is bad but there are really worse out there.  Have you ever seen Truth Or Dare?  I mean the movie where mental patients get a hold of a grenade and blow their own heads off?  Well that is really bad I mean really really bad.  And as I said this is just bad.  But I saw it in an empty theater during the day. Seriously there was just me and a friend.  And at AMC in Toronto they have retractable arm rests so that you can put them back and use the seats as a couch which is what we did.  It was very comfortable and we enjoyed the movie quite a bit more that way.  Bats will probably be gone by the time this review gets to IMDb so you may not have a chance to see it at the theater but if you are in a campy horror movie mood then rent this when it comes out on video.  You may enjoy it.  I hope you didn't take my accolades too seriously at the beginning of the film it was all in good fun.  And remember sometimes bad movies can be fun to see.  You don't have to think you don't really have to feel either.  And you get to laugh at stupid people doing stupid things.  Bats is a great example of that.  If Bats is even ever mentioned in the same sentence as American Beauty come Oscar time there will be a federal inquiry and Mr. Logan and the backers of this movie may go to a maximum state prison and his punishment would be to watch this movie every day of his sentence.  Now that would be funny.".

The guy that first gets killed at the beginning is named Quint and when they do an autopsy on him it wreaked of Hoopers little angry deposition in Jaws when he tells them that it wasn't a boating accident.  And if you can pick up on little subtleties like that then the film is more fun.  Really this isn't all that bad I mean it is bad but there are really worse out there.  Have you ever seen Truth Or Dare?  I mean the movie where mental patients get a hold of a grenade and blow their own heads off?  Well that is really bad I mean really really bad.  And as I said this is just bad.  But I saw it in an empty theater during the day. Seriously there was just me and a friend.  And at AMC in Toronto they have retractable arm rests so that you can put them back and use the seats as a couch which is what we did.  It was very comfortable and we enjoyed the movie quite a bit more that way.  Bats will probably be gone by the time this review gets to IMDb so you may not have a chance to see it at the theater but if you are in a campy horror movie mood then rent this when it comes out on video.  You may enjoy it.  I hope you didn't take my accolades too seriously at the beginning of the film it was all in good fun.  And remember sometimes bad movies can be fun to see.  You don't have to think you don't really have to feel either.  And you get to laugh at stupid people doing stupid things.  Bats is a great example of that.  If Bats is even ever mentioned in the same sentence as American Beauty come Oscar time there will be a federal inquiry and Mr. Logan and the backers of this movie may go to a maximum state prison and his punishment would be to watch this movie every day of his sentence.  Now that would be funny.";

It also goes without saying that when one of the heroes is attacked they can literally fight off dozens of the critters but one bite from a single bat is enough to kill a nameless extra . If this was a STAR TREK episode most people would be wearing a red top I notice that during the attack on the town the local cinema is showing NOSFERATU which seems to indicate a post modernist sophistication on the part of the makers but again would a small American town be showing legendary silent movies at the local cinema ?

Yet from the looks of it  its rating on here  most people thought this was bad. Boy have they not seen 'bad' yet. Things would get a lot worse in years to come with these type of films. For one thing try watching the alleged sequel to Bats called Bats Human Harvest. The thing was made in 2007 for TV and then dumped to DVD as well. Go watch it it's about 5 times worse than this film. Then come back and tell me which is the bad film out of those two. Or go watch Fangs from 2001 starring Corbin Bernsen. It's the silly version of Bats. I tell you things can get a lot worse than this modest piece of killer bats entertainment. It even stars Lou Diamond Phillips and Dina Meyer. In 'worse' movies you can't even count on a cast like this anymore. So why the complaints  pusspoor ratings on here?I've seen quite some crappy horrormovies already and you can say what you want about Bats but it's not a bad movie. Clichd? Yes kind of. Seen it all before? Yes most likely. But the production values are more than just okay. It's well made. It looks good. Good camera work. The acting is more decent than what you normally can expect from a movie like this these days like stuff produced by SciFi Channel The Asylum need I continue?. I've seen much much worse special effects when it comes to the CGI used in this one. And there are actually some cool shots of animatronic bats to be admired from puppets with full body movement to closeups of their heads with moving ears grinning teeth and blinking eyes  it's always a kick to see SFX artists go the extra mile on this. The film's fairly fastpaced keeps you going and never gets boring. It's basically a Bmovie that looks damn good sort of like stuff similar to Tremors a fine early 90's monster movie classic and its sequels. Or if you bump down the ladder a bit you'll find a lot more lower budgeted genre outings telling pretty much the same story Skeeter from 1993 comes to mind.Of course Tremors works better on a variety of levels and Bats isn't as great by a long shot. For one thing it misses some wit and that black guy Leon playing Jimmy Sands trying to provide it didn't do a lot of good either. Still a fun popcornmovie for the somewhat less demanding horrorfan. If you have this feeling that genetically altered killer bats might amuse you then ignore the low rating on here and just watch it.Now can someone recommend me a better movie with a whole bunch of killer bats in it?".

	schema:reviewBody "Hearing of a series of bat attacks a scientist and her helper arrive in a small Texas town to deal with the creatures only to learn they're genetically modified killing machines and must find a way of dealing with the creatures once and for all before they escape.There are some pretty good points in this one. What's really enjoyable about this one a lot of great moments is the highamount of action scenes within this one with a really fast and quite watchable pace to it. The opening attack where the bats appear to attack the couple in the truck makes for a strong opening while a followup encounter where the bats swarm over a truck containing several characters when a second one comes up and they suddenly become aware of the new vehicle and come to an abrupt stop then turn their heads towards the car so that their eyes light up a malevolent yellow which is one of the best shots. The main sequence in the middle of the movie where a large swarm of bats attacks the middle of town causing general panic and mayhem also this helps out as the large amount of action including causing cars crashing into electrical poles gets in tons of small individual encounters of the population getting swarmed allowing for a lot of great action and gore while the fact that it plays out over a long period of time is quite nice. As well there's the later attack on the school as there's some solid swarming and ambushes there which makes for a fun time and the finale in the tunnel makes for some atmospheric times with some rather frantic and enjoyable times trying to get out before they wake up which is what's quite thrilling about the sequence while providing a lot of fun actionpacked moments here. It's also a little refreshing to see everybody agreeing that the problem is bats right from the start rather than having the clichd extended argument among people who had clear evidence that it was bats and someone like the chief cop constantly butt heads over what the culprit is until it had a physical attack done in front of everyone to convince them is a nice change of pace. The last plus here is that the bats are actually pretty good and they're really believable by abandoning the CGI commonly used for these types of films since the puppets look pretty realistic and their closeups make them out to be pretty terrifying to a degree. This is a lot better than it's been made out to be although it does have some problems. The biggest one here is that there are several confusing shots in this. Every time there was some sort of dramatic bat attack the camera would go off on some sort of hypedup whirlwind of herkyjerky motion that keeps it from being scary as the attack scenes become moot because we don't even get to see what's going on in the scene the cuts are so quick. The film provides in spades since you often can't tell what is happening on screen and making the technique even more obnoxious is that it's used pretty much throughout the entire film. The origin of the bats is also a little confusing. All we know is that bats are attacking while how they're attacking and what exactly is happening remains a mystery. These bring the film down slightly from what it could've been.Rated PG13 Violence Adult Language and photographic violence of animals.".

What's really enjoyable about this one a lot of great moments is the highamount of action scenes within this one with a really fast and quite watchable pace to it. The opening attack where the bats appear to attack the couple in the truck makes for a strong opening while a followup encounter where the bats swarm over a truck containing several characters when a second one comes up and they suddenly become aware of the new vehicle and come to an abrupt stop then turn their heads towards the car so that their eyes light up a malevolent yellow which is one of the best shots. The main sequence in the middle of the movie where a large swarm of bats attacks the middle of town causing general panic and mayhem also this helps out as the large amount of action including causing cars crashing into electrical poles gets in tons of small individual encounters of the population getting swarmed allowing for a lot of great action and gore while the fact that it plays out over a long period of time is quite nice. As well there's the later attack on the school as there's some solid swarming and ambushes there which makes for a fun time and the finale in the tunnel makes for some atmospheric times with some rather frantic and enjoyable times trying to get out before they wake up which is what's quite thrilling about the sequence while providing a lot of fun actionpacked moments here. It's also a little refreshing to see everybody agreeing that the problem is bats right from the start rather than having the clichd extended argument among people who had clear evidence that it was bats and someone like the chief cop constantly butt heads over what the culprit is until it had a physical attack done in front of everyone to convince them is a nice change of pace. The last plus here is that the bats are actually pretty good and they're really believable by abandoning the CGI commonly used for these types of films since the puppets look pretty realistic and their closeups make them out to be pretty terrifying to a degree. This is a lot better than it's been made out to be although it does have some problems. The biggest one here is that there are several confusing shots in this. Every time there was some sort of dramatic bat attack the camera would go off on some sort of hypedup whirlwind of herkyjerky motion that keeps it from being scary as the attack scenes become moot because we don't even get to see what's going on in the scene the cuts are so quick. The film provides in spades since you often can't tell what is happening on screen and making the technique even more obnoxious is that it's used pretty much throughout the entire film. The origin of the bats is also a little confusing. All we know is that bats are attacking while how they're attacking and what exactly is happening remains a mystery. These bring the film down slightly from what it could've been.Rated PG13 Violence Adult Language and photographic violence of animals.";

Before I give my observations on the movie itself I would just like to point out that many who stated this movie was an accurate portrayal clearly has no experience or expertise that would qualify them to make the statement. Something I hope people keep in mind when reading other reviews. As a Marine who actually served in Haditha as well as many other locations reading many of the reviews sickened me because it shows how little people actually understand just as I usually wear a long sleeved shirt because my USMC tattoo brings on questions praise or derision from the clueless masses who for some reason believe they have some insight to any reality outside their own convenient world.That said I feel this movie is much better then most. The film clearly had an agenda and bias and completely off the mark in terms of representing military tactics equipment etc... that is pretty much standard for any movie. I appreciated how the movie wasn't overly dramatic when showing issues faced by and actions of the various parties. One thing I wish the movie did take in to account is bullets pass through those walls like paper. I would wager that a large number of civilians were killed simply during an exchange of fire between the Marines fighters and then civilians who may have just seen a loved one fall. I have seen this happen often and I hope one day that reality is brought to light rather then showing young Marines on a blind rampage. However no one knows exactly what happened except those who were there and even that reality or truth depends on the perspective and state of mind of the observer. Another positive is how the movie doesn't really show any right or wrong good or bad that things just are and sh!t happens. If anything I do think that is the true agenda of the movie even if there was a bias in its portrayal. Also I appreciated the use of Iraqi dialect of Arabic instead of modern standard Egyptian Syrian etc. Another accuracy plus was how close the towncity looked compared to cities of the region. Though clearly not Haditha I have not seen any movie closer to the truth in that regard.On a personal note I think many of the comments made by Cpl Ramirez were spot on if a bit staged. I am not going to comment on any particular comment because you either understand or you don't. Also and I know this is a bit of a stretch but I refuse to give credibility to any one who may seek to either attack or defend verbally our war fighters because context is everything and the most people don't have or understand the context.I recommend this movie to anyone who is able to take if for what it is worth by dropping the expectation of realism while not adding meaning where there is not. Also I hope people realize that no matter how many actual Marine veterans or Iraqi's most westernized the film is a product of the film maker and subject to their interpretation. I only wish I could have had my say about the movie sooner if only to plant the seed that people should take this movie and the other reviews including mine with a grain of salt.".

The second focuses on a Corporal Ruiz a young Marine who you feel wants to be anywhere but Iraqi and the finally the film focuses on a young Iraqi couple and their extended family.The film is shot Cinmavrit style and at times is very harrowing. But it's to Broomfields credit that he to my mind he doesn't simply demonize the US soldiers. Instead you get to understand how young men put in a situation that you the viewer couldn't understand let alone cope with could just lose it after a comrade is killed. Likewise in the films portrayal of the insurgent fighters Broomfield manages to make you think what would you do if as in the film your a professional soldier made jobless by a an Occupying force. How do you feed your family and wouldn't you feel some resentment to the occupation forces for making you jobless. But it's in the Iraqi families caught between the US forces and the Insurgents that the film is at it's best. They can't do the right thing for doing wrong. It is they who bear the brunt of either Insurgency retaliation or US Forces heavyhandedness. They who ultimately will and are the losers in Film.This is a powerful film which deals with all aspects of the problem fair mindedly but doesn't shy away from the truth.

The war in Iraq is a subject that divides people like no other in recent times. As with any conflict the war in Iraq has its supporters and its detractors. There is no middle ground. There are no grey areas everything is just black or white. Either you believe it's a justifiable war or you don't. This brings me to Nick Broomfield's new film The Battle For Haditha. The subject of the film is controversial as it deals with an incident in the city of Haditha allegedly involving the US Marines. Broomfield uses actors some of whom are former US Marines and Iraq veterans as well as Iraqi refugees to fashion a film that successfully straddles the gap between a regular documentary and a straightforward feature film. The film encompasses three points of view those of the Marines the insurgents and the families who lived near where the roadside bomb detonated. This film is a fictionalised account of what actually happened at Haditha. It shows quite graphically the horrors of war and what the Americans as well as innocent Iraqis have to go through almost on a daily basis. There are deaths on both sides but it's Iraqi civilians who are caught in the crossfire and who have to bear the brunt of dealing with men who have been stretched to breaking point. The film in no way condones the actions of either the insurgents or the Marines. It just shows the audience what might have occurred on that fateful day and it's for those in the audience to make up their own minds as to who was in the right and who was in the wrong. When reading some of the comments posted on the message board for this film I find it somewhat puzzling that some contributors write that Battle For Haditha is antiAmerican. Just because the US Marines are shown in a less than sympathetic light in this film does not mean the film is on the side of the insurgents. What the film does demonstrate is how quickly things can get out of hand in a situation such as that in Haditha. By all means criticize a film on its merits or lack of them. Please though do not label this film as unAmerican just because it doesn't fit a blinkered view of the way the world is.".

	schema:headline " Getting the Iraqis right this time yes it really does matter";
	schema:reviewBody "In this new film that few in America will see in theaters the English documentary filmmaker Nick Broomfield has taken his skill set into a narrative feature of an actual event of the Iraq war and dramatized and embellished it with often harrowing realism. Broomfield has humanized an American atrocity the socalled Battle for Haditha of November 19 2005 in which several dozen Iraqi civilians in the eponymous town were slaughtered by a small squad of Marines in retaliation for a hidden road bomb that killed one of their men and gravely injured two others. Broomfield humanizes everybody. The insurgents who plant the bomb paid to do it by Al Qaida in Iraq people whom they don't trust or like are a man who was in the Iraqi army destroyed by Paul Bremer and his grown son who sells DVD's to American soldiers. The civilians who happen to live near the road where the bomb goes off are seen up close a child fascinated by chickens a big family a circumcision party a couple with a child on the way who are deeply in love. All these are made real and known to the audience by the film. But so are the Marines especially the main one Corporal Ramirez Elliot Ruiz who though barely twenty is so battleweary he is haunted by dreams and guilt and cannot sleep. It's Ramirez who cracking under the strain and the sleeplessness and given the goahead by corps superiors off somewhere with electronic maps distant kills are like a video game leads the rampage of murders then collapses and weeps when rising for another day.All this is very interesting and the killings are similar to those in De Palma's flashy but so very slipshod 'Redacted' but so very very different in this new context with the simpler shootjust a digital camera that you can forget about after a while whereas De Palma rubs your nose in the multiple media feeds the other American soldiers less specific here but cruder and perhaps more authentic some of them like Ruiz were in the war themselves and served and know the way to act without being told.But what is extraordinary in Broomfield's film isn't any of this so much as one thing that typically American reviewers have hardly seemed to notice. This is that not only are the Iraqis seen up close they are real Iraqis speaking Iraqi Arabic and many of them like the young actor who plays Ramirez also on the other side as victims and noncombatants veterans of the war now living where the film was made and where they fled to in Jordan. When Ramirez shows a big scar on his leg and says he almost lost it it's Ruiz's real battle scar. Ruiz's performance has a new kind of conviction.Why would Americans' notice that about the Iraqi Arabic the authentic Iraqi nonactors playing the roles of insurgents and local inhabitants and why would they care? In fact even the Choir to whom this antiwar movie is preaching are as ignorant and indifferent to the specifics of Middle Eastern cultural reality as the naive and headstrong men who got us into the war and the poor and uneducated boys who have pursued it and died in it and come back maimed and mentally damaged from it. But in the future this may come to matter and even be understood by American Iraq war veterans. Language is important and culture is important. One shouldn't have to say that. But if it were understood the imperial indifference of bringing democracy to the Middle East would crumble and it wouldn't seem so easy to think that killing a hundred thousand civilians would make us friends.Using real Iraqis and a lead Marine who's an Iraq war vet were master strokes but this doesn't excuse the film from being in many ways selfdamagingly roughshod and despite the multiple viewpoints still skewed at times. The Iraqi civilians who become victims are given a fairy tale simplicity their complicity or involvement in weapons and explosives though alluded to not specified for any of the victims. There needed to be something more specific about a Marine other than Ramirez.The chief bad guys which seems right are those at one remove the Marine supervisors away from the front and the local imam whose encouraging the locals to ignore the danger and hold a celebration is a cynical gesture to worsen the casualties and make them seem more cruel to the media.Broomfield has used blunt instruments to shape his story and his ending is a little muddled partly from necessity since the accused Marines hadn't yet been tried. Nonetheless the authenticity particularly of the Iraqis but of the whole scene wins The Battle of Haditha a special place in the lessthanstellar roster of Iraq war films thus far delivered.".

The civilians who happen to live near the road where the bomb goes off are seen up close a child fascinated by chickens a big family a circumcision party a couple with a child on the way who are deeply in love. All these are made real and known to the audience by the film. But so are the Marines especially the main one Corporal Ramirez Elliot Ruiz who though barely twenty is so battleweary he is haunted by dreams and guilt and cannot sleep. It's Ramirez who cracking under the strain and the sleeplessness and given the goahead by corps superiors off somewhere with electronic maps distant kills are like a video game leads the rampage of murders then collapses and weeps when rising for another day.All this is very interesting and the killings are similar to those in De Palma's flashy but so very slipshod 'Redacted' but so very very different in this new context with the simpler shootjust a digital camera that you can forget about after a while whereas De Palma rubs your nose in the multiple media feeds the other American soldiers less specific here but cruder and perhaps more authentic some of them like Ruiz were in the war themselves and served and know the way to act without being told.But what is extraordinary in Broomfield's film isn't any of this so much as one thing that typically American reviewers have hardly seemed to notice. This is that not only are the Iraqis seen up close they are real Iraqis speaking Iraqi Arabic and many of them like the young actor who plays Ramirez also on the other side as victims and noncombatants veterans of the war now living where the film was made and where they fled to in Jordan. When Ramirez shows a big scar on his leg and says he almost lost it it's Ruiz's real battle scar. Ruiz's performance has a new kind of conviction.Why would Americans' notice that about the Iraqi Arabic the authentic Iraqi nonactors playing the roles of insurgents and local inhabitants and why would they care? In fact even the Choir to whom this antiwar movie is preaching are as ignorant and indifferent to the specifics of Middle Eastern cultural reality as the naive and headstrong men who got us into the war and the poor and uneducated boys who have pursued it and died in it and come back maimed and mentally damaged from it. But in the future this may come to matter and even be understood by American Iraq war veterans. Language is important and culture is important. One shouldn't have to say that. But if it were understood the imperial indifference of bringing democracy to the Middle East would crumble and it wouldn't seem so easy to think that killing a hundred thousand civilians would make us friends.Using real Iraqis and a lead Marine who's an Iraq war vet were master strokes but this doesn't excuse the film from being in many ways selfdamagingly roughshod and despite the multiple viewpoints still skewed at times. The Iraqi civilians who become victims are given a fairy tale simplicity their complicity or involvement in weapons and explosives though alluded to not specified for any of the victims. There needed to be something more specific about a Marine other than Ramirez.The chief bad guys which seems right are those at one remove the Marine supervisors away from the front and the local imam whose encouraging the locals to ignore the danger and hold a celebration is a cynical gesture to worsen the casualties and make them seem more cruel to the media.Broomfield has used blunt instruments to shape his story and his ending is a little muddled partly from necessity since the accused Marines hadn't yet been tried. Nonetheless the authenticity particularly of the Iraqis but of the whole scene wins The Battle of Haditha a special place in the lessthanstellar roster of Iraq war films thus far delivered.";

It is an independent film so you shouldn't expect Black Hawk Down.Many of the negative reviews simply reflect an aversion to anything perceived as AntiAmerican. I am a veteran of the Iraq war with two tours of combat duty. I have lost brothers in arms. I have witnessed the suffering of civilians vast majority at the hands of insurgents. I was close to AlAnbar Province when this happened. To claim it was all lies is simply lying to yourself. If you cannot distinguish between engaging the enemy and murdering unarmed men women and especially children either your moral compass is way off or you are completely brainwashed or both. One poster above referred to insurgents as less than human. It's that kind of thinking that leads to these kind of atrocities. No army on earth is immune to barbarism if there is a breakdown in leadership especially in an emotional situation like this. It is all too common that civilians will be the victims of collateral damage. That's what makes war so terrible. The reality is that 99 of American servicemen and women conduct themselves honorably. It is to protect that honor and give some justice to the victims that these marines should have been dishonorably discharged and sentenced to Ft. Leavenworth.".

	schema:reviewBody "On the 19th November 2005 Kilo Company of the US Marines were attacked by an IED detonated remotely. One marine was killed and two injured. In the hours immediately after this incident the search for those responsible took in the houses in the immediate area. After the search was complete twentyfour Iraqi men women and children were dead.Fellow reviewer Theo Robertson was fortunate enough to attend a screening of this film with the director recently but I also appreciate the ability to watch it without being surrounded by let's face it the choir in regards the point the film is making. My view of the situation was brought home to me by a minor character in HBO's The Wire who is on the brink of war with another gang and notes that it is too late now for the who's and why's because the war is on and lie or not they have to fight. This is almost how I see Iraq now  we all know about the lack of WMD's the political spin to freedom and regime change the lack of plan for peace and so on. We also know that really those in charge will never be held responsible so lets make the best we can out of the situation.So for me Broomfield's film is almost spot on because it focuses on this fight and it forces the viewer to face the fact that the very difficult questions of how that can be done. In ways that are a bit blocky in nature we do get three distinct groups of characters  the marines the men planting the bomb for money and local families living in the area. This approach does several things really well and the overall impact is utterly depressing and left me wondering how we ever will get out of Iraqi in anyway that would be even slightly positive. The marines are handled pretty well I thought. The viewer is allowed into their world where they are being asked to respond to unseen attackers in a world where everyone is a suspect. Of course the response is unacceptable but Broomfield makes it possible to understand why this happened and the desire to lash out and response is tangible.Of course the attachment to the civilians makes it sickening. Although it is a little obvious I did like the way that Broomfield used an attractive and sexual couple at the core of this group making it easier for western audiences to see people and not a religion in them. I also appreciated how the response is not milked for emotion by using music slowmotion or any other trick designed to tell you that what you are watching is terrible. Instead it is cold and clean and all the more shocking for it. The third group is also well used  two men with no specific religious beliefs but a hatred for the soldiers and a desire for money for murder. They are not presented as good men in bad situations but rather their aim is clear  however the film lets us see that they never intended to make things worse. In this emotion we see a distinction between them whose aim is murder of US soldiers and those who seek to inspire chaos and murder to further fuel the fire and get recruits. This aspect is the most depressing.The film is not perfect though and the way that Broomfield has to use this story to make points means that at times he does have to make narrative sweeps. Thus the story leads to further recruitment recriminations against specific soldiers and of course a clean bill of health for those in charge. These are all fair points but they clash slightly with the tight gritty focus of the rest of the film on the specifics and I did think that the same points could have been made in a less obvious manner since the meat of that argument is entirely in the Haditha incident. The delivery of the film is convincing and the Jordan location is well used. Broomfield's documentary background comes through really well and the action feels real  which does help prevent it being exciting or thrilling. He also gets reasonably good performances from the cast. I say reasonably good because when they are called upon to emote it does feel like they are acting but otherwise they are mostly very natural and convincing. I refer specifically to Ruiz really good when in the thick of it and reacting but is not as good when asked to breakdown.Overall then this is an engaging and impacting film that surprised me by being quite balanced or at least as balanced as a film showing US marines murdering unarmed civilians can be. The characters are not forgiven or shown positively but their behaviour is all shown in the context of Iraqi  backing up the claim that those at the top need to be shouldering a lot of the blame. He does tend to let the film dip when he has to move into more general territory towards the end but otherwise it is a strong and impacting affair that deserves to be seen.".

Although it is a little obvious I did like the way that Broomfield used an attractive and sexual couple at the core of this group making it easier for western audiences to see people and not a religion in them. I also appreciated how the response is not milked for emotion by using music slowmotion or any other trick designed to tell you that what you are watching is terrible. Instead it is cold and clean and all the more shocking for it. The third group is also well used  two men with no specific religious beliefs but a hatred for the soldiers and a desire for money for murder. They are not presented as good men in bad situations but rather their aim is clear  however the film lets us see that they never intended to make things worse. In this emotion we see a distinction between them whose aim is murder of US soldiers and those who seek to inspire chaos and murder to further fuel the fire and get recruits. This aspect is the most depressing.The film is not perfect though and the way that Broomfield has to use this story to make points means that at times he does have to make narrative sweeps. Thus the story leads to further recruitment recriminations against specific soldiers and of course a clean bill of health for those in charge. These are all fair points but they clash slightly with the tight gritty focus of the rest of the film on the specifics and I did think that the same points could have been made in a less obvious manner since the meat of that argument is entirely in the Haditha incident. The delivery of the film is convincing and the Jordan location is well used. Broomfield's documentary background comes through really well and the action feels real  which does help prevent it being exciting or thrilling. He also gets reasonably good performances from the cast. I say reasonably good because when they are called upon to emote it does feel like they are acting but otherwise they are mostly very natural and convincing. I refer specifically to Ruiz really good when in the thick of it and reacting but is not as good when asked to breakdown.Overall then this is an engaging and impacting film that surprised me by being quite balanced or at least as balanced as a film showing US marines murdering unarmed civilians can be. The characters are not forgiven or shown positively but their behaviour is all shown in the context of Iraqi  backing up the claim that those at the top need to be shouldering a lot of the blame. He does tend to let the film dip when he has to move into more general territory towards the end but otherwise it is a strong and impacting affair that deserves to be seen.";

	schema:headline " Nick Broomfield Is The Perfect Antidote To Michael Moore";
	schema:reviewBody "It wasn't until very recently that I'd heard of Nick Broomfield and realised he made a couple of documentaries in the early 1980s that I still vividly remember namely SOLDIER GIRLS and THE CHICKEN RANCH . Knowing this I then made a point of catching his recent docudrama GHOSTS about the drowning of 23 illegal Chinese immigrants at Morcombe Bay . I was expecting it to be one of those  blame whitey  polemics  but this is not how it turned out at all with the Chinese gang master being one the most despicable and immoral villains I've seen on the screen in a long time . With this I mind I made a point of buying a ticket for Broomfield's next dramatic venture THE BATTLE OF HADITHA which was being shown at the Edinburgh filmhouse with a Q  A session being held after the showing . Despite the filmhouse brochure proclaiming that this was an even handed film with the marine characters exclusively played by former marines  there was a slight doubt at the back of my mind that we'd be watching guardinista  Michael Moore inspired anti military  anti American rubbish where the Americans are goose stepping Nazis while the Iraqis are entirely peace loving pacifists I needn't have worried because Broomfield has made a film that will be remembered as being the moral and artistic yardstick as to how other films dealing with the conflict will be judged . Whatever your opinion of the invasion of Iraq  I like the vast majority of Brits was against it  there is no way you can heap criticism on TBOH for being pro or anti propaganda for either side . Sure it's anti war but does point out the dangers and frustration faced by both serving soldiers and innocent civilians in a war zone . If there is any type of villain it's probably Al Qaeda itself . Certainly Broomfield deserves congratulations for making a very subtle point that there's a difference between indigenous secular Sunni insurgents who are fighting for their country and those outsiders who want to turn Iraq in to an Islamic theocracy . This probably works best in the scene where the Iraqi insurgent breaks down in tears saying he wished he'd never planted the bomb that leads to the massacre while the sheik rejoices with barely concealed glee that this is a wonderful propaganda coup for Iraq  the more civilians killed by the occupation forces means more recruits for Al Qaeda If I do have any artistic problems with the misenscene it's that some of the acting is different from what an avid cinema goer is used to . This is in no way a criticism because much of the acting is powerful especially Elliot Ruiz as Cpl Rameirez  even more amazing when you consider there's very few professional actors cast . It's just that when you're very used to life long lighter than life or larger than life performances by  Insert well regarded big name actor here  you are slighter aware how different the acting is from what you usually see . Let me repeat though that it's not a real criticism Respect too to Mr Broomfield for giving a very informative Q  A session after the showing where he was once again very even handed . He did talk a lot of sense where he said that in his humble opinion it should be Bush and Blair who should be on trial instead of the marines which led me to start a round of applause and that peace is coming to Iraq down to the fact that foreign Jihidists are murdering many Iraqis just for the sake of it . He did trip himself up later during the session when he claimed that  Britain and America spent several years arming both sides during the Iran  Iraq war  which led to me shouting  RUBBISH  but there were no hard feelings on either side and I genuinely look forward to Nick's next contribution to narrative cinema . Come to think of it if a Brit can make something so even handed why do we have to endure offensive Anglophobic garbage coming out of Hollywood studios like THE PATRIOT and THE DEVIL'S OWN ?".

	schema:reviewBody "Two Iraqi ideologues blow up a Humveee with an IED and rush away to safety. The Marines retaliate by bashing their way through the nearby houses and shooting everything that moves. A dozen or more innocents are killed on the spot. The result of the Americans' actions is dutifully filmed by al Qaeda agents and used as recruiting material. The Marine corporal in charge of the engagement is at first applauded for his leadership and recommended for promotion and a decoration and then when the incident hits the American press brought up on multiple charges of murder.It's a tough movie to watch. It's not preachy although all points of view are presented but the harsh irony is a bit much to bear. In many ways the most emblematic scene has an innocent young man running down a hill in the simmering and smoky aftermath of the shoot out. He's searching for his wife. But the Marines gun him down from a hundred yards away because after all what is an Iraqi man doing running at a time like this? It's at the least suspicious.But then his wife arrives screaming and throws herself on the dead body. Ramirez who is leading the fire team approaches her with his rifle ready and shouts at her to move away from the body. She doesn't understand English and he speaks no Arabic. The wife finally flings herself at Ramirez and begins beating his shoulders and for a moment it seems that she will be killed as well.That seems to me anyway to be the message of the film. Murky but powerful forces can bring together people who simply don't understand each other and the result is a blood bath.The Marines we meet are brash but sympathetic figures. True they are kind of dumb but then many of us are pretty dumb when it comes to situations like this. One leader calls the insurgents cowards because they hide among the women and children. The men may or may not know why they are in Iraq but it's not their job to know. Their job is to define the enemy and kill him.Complications arise when the enemy blends insensibly into the innocent civilians. A woman or an adolescent child can carry a rifle or an explosive as easily as a fully grown man.Disregarding values and ideology that problem is common to all armies of occupation. The Germans had similar problems in occupied countries like France Yugoslavia and Greece. And like the Marines in Iraq the insurgents were a disparate group drawn from different ideologies some more extreme than others. The core of the Greek resistance for example wasn't al Qaeda  it was the communists. And as in Iraq resistance from extremists was met with retaliation against ordinary citizens by the Germans.This isn't an expensive epic of a movie. It's not Blackhawk Down or anything. The production values are lower than that. And I understand it doesn't stick to historical fact. Some of the acting is weak and the dialog contrived. I don't believe any U. S. Marine has ever said I'll be haunted by this guilt for the rest of my life. The story isn't easily described as sad despite the numerous murders. Tragic is a better descriptive. The bad guys here aren't so much the Marines or the active insurgents for that matter. It's the configuration of values and political decisions that have brought these two forces together in a state of conflict.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm afraid I can't agree with all the gushing praise being heaped onto this film. It really didn't cut it for me. The way the story was presented made it unbelievable and for a war film there were way too many technical errors to believe the director even consulted the military before or during filming. On top of this the suddenness of the atrocity which I assume was the core of the film beggars belief.I won't list all of the technical errors I spotted because after a career in the military which spans more than 40 years and three major conflicts I spotted quite a lot. But the following were the most obvious and for all serving and former military personnel quite laughable The casual way the soldiers patrolled both in vehicles and on foot the .50 Cal machine guns that are never loaded the extras who appear at the IED site with weapons but no webbing the Humvees parked in nice little rows along the side of the road with no protection armour or weapons. And as for anyone standing directly in front of a metal gate and firing a burst into the lock in order to gain entrance well if he hadn't shot himself or his team with ricochets the first time he did it he certainly would have on subsequent occasions.I assume these were errors because if they reflect the current tactics and drills of the US Marines then the quality has really deteriorated seriously since I served alongside them in Vietnam.I can't fault the acting and I think this is the only thing which saves this film. However the continuity and story left a lot to be desired. For example in the film Ramirez didn't order the executions  he ordered his teams to clear the houses which is a normal action when in contact with insurgents. The marines took it upon themselves to throw grenades and fire indiscriminately into the rooms. That is what the film showed. But if he did order the massacre then the things he'd been through must have been progressively leading him to this time and place but we don't see any of that in the film beyond a short dialogue about him having frightening dreams. So the big question that we are left with is why did he allegedly give the orders which as I said it isn't really all that clear in the film that he did so? Why were all of the NCOs charged with murder? Where was the investigation? I thought it was a good idea to include their perspective but the dialogue amongst the civilians was almost too much to bear. I know the film was unscripted but they must have been instructed to say whatever they want but make sure it makes American audiences feel that their presence in Iraq is welcomed albeit an unnecessary evil that the civilians must put up with. But did they have to be so effusive about it? And as for the men who planted the IED and fired the first shots on the troops  why should they have an excuse for doing so that would gel with western audiences? Why couldn't they do it for example just because they wanted to hurt the occupying forces? But they like the Americans were 'just following orders' weren't they? They like the solders were pawns in a game being played out by loonies with power but no intention of doing the dirty work themselves. But we need these kind of explanations don't we so that we don't leave the cinema wondering why things happen. But not everything has a tangible and logical reason. We had a wonderful saying in Vietnam  st happens so just get over it and move on. Why couldn't the insurgents have as their reason for planting the IED and firing on the troops that they are who they are and we are who we are and that is there is to it? It seems to work so well for other mujahadeen.I know that this film is based on actual events but I'm afraid that the whole thing was trivialised by poor script well there was none and this shows poor casting am I the only one who noticed a likeness between the marine captain and the imam? poor technical direction and poor directing.Sorry  a big thumbs down from me.".

	schema:headline " well filmed but biased and inaccurate.";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm going to make this short the point in this comment is not to really review but to simply point out a few things.First of all I would like to say the movie is filmed pretty well the actors are pretty good and the accuracy as far as props and whatnot are pretty good.The biggest problem I have with this movie is the title is wrong. I find it extremely disrespectful that they used they battle for haditha as the name. Anyone who knows anything on the subject is aware that the battle for haditha was an operation in which the marines took control of the city. Not one shot was fired but correct me if i am wrong 8 marines were killed. Now using the name of an operation in which marines risked there lives and lost them to take over the city and only detained people for what is otherwise known as the haditha massacre is ridiculous and disrespectful.The second problem I have with the movie is as far as the event it is fairly inaccurate and is biased. Failing to even try to cover both sides of the story until perhaps the end the movie got on my nerves after a while. It was not 1 Humvee that got blown up and 1 killed 2 wounded. It was 1 AAV that got blown up. Killing 5 and the sixth found slaughtered a few miles down the road. Whether or not the marines purposely killed the civilians whether it was routine and they treated the houses as extremely hostile or not or whether insurgents killed them we will never know. But as the movie points out the man Told the little girl 9 years old not 12 what to say. which is entirely possible. Also note that the Man who made and promoted the tape was of the Hamurabi human rights group furthering the idea that it could be a setup.I just want anyone to know as they should. When and after watching this movie please don't treat it as the truth. I am not saying it happened or the opposite happened. But the movie only covers one side of the story and is inaccurate as it is only showing that 1 marine died in the face of the iraqi civilian deaths.Too many people these days watch movies like this and treat it as fact and then go around arguing with people and telling them bs when they have no idea what they are talking about nor are they even aware they don't have the events name right...".

	onyx:emotionText "I'm going to make this short the point in this comment is not to really review but to simply point out a few things.First of all I would like to say the movie is filmed pretty well the actors are pretty good and the accuracy as far as props and whatnot are pretty good.The biggest problem I have with this movie is the title is wrong. I find it extremely disrespectful that they used they battle for haditha as the name. Anyone who knows anything on the subject is aware that the battle for haditha was an operation in which the marines took control of the city. Not one shot was fired but correct me if i am wrong 8 marines were killed. Now using the name of an operation in which marines risked there lives and lost them to take over the city and only detained people for what is otherwise known as the haditha massacre is ridiculous and disrespectful.The second problem I have with the movie is as far as the event it is fairly inaccurate and is biased.

	schema:reviewBody "While the Iraq War certainly deserves its fair share of scrutiny and history will surely paint a less than stellar picture of the politics behind the war and those leaders Republican and Democrat who led the United States into that war those who served in it deserve at least the smallest measure of dignity in their portrayal. And filmmakers attempting to portray them owe them a small amount of integrity in their work.Nick Broomfield's film has no such integrity. It misrepresents lies and sensationalizes at every turn creating wholly unrealistic situations and even making bald faced lies about Marine Corps policies as well as tactics techniques and procedures TTPs. The film claims to have used veterans of the United States military however any of the actors used in this film who are prior service should be ashamed for participating.It is the Iraq War critic's dream film where every preconceived notion of what is wrong with the American occupation is true every injustice levied against our troops by their own government is true and every hyperviolent baby killer traumatized stereotype of the American fighting man is also true. The film describes an endless series of falsehoods before it even reaches the half way point in its run time. A Marine is told he cannot visit a doctor until after he goes home and then only on his leave. This has never ever been true. And while there is often peer pressure or doctrinal conditioning and even sometimes situational factors that prevents Marines from seeking immediate mental help none would ever be outright denied that help let alone told that he could not receive it in theater. The film also shows a man clown up by a UAV for simply walking down the street with a shovel. This is also patently against US Rules of Engagement and would never happen. Broomfield even chooses to sensationalize it more by showing moments before that the man had the shovel to plant a tree at a celebratory party making the scene all the more despicable to include in the film. Marines are shown threatening prisoners by claiming to hold their families hostage.If there is even the possibility that the events of November 19th 2005 were an atrocity it can be said with certainty that this film is one. In his rush to capitalize on and sensationalize Nick Broomfield abandoned any pretext of credibility and any sense of integrity. This film is disgusting. Whether you believe the war in Iraq was merely misguided or you believe it was an outright lie and detestable this film serves no purpose as a piece of war criticism. One does not have to lie to shown wrong in war. And Nick Broomfield is a liar. He's lucky that he cannot be sued for libel and slander by the Marine Corps. To refer to his film as a docudrama is a sick joke. There is no docu present here at all. A note to filmmakers Please by all means explore criticism of the war in Iraq. It is important for future generations that Americans no longer blindly support military action and not get caught up in surges of war hysteria and revenge driven blood lust. But when you do it do it honestly or it makes you even bigger liars than those you seek to condemn.".

	schema:reviewBody "In this review I will attempt to keep my personal political views out of it as much as possible. It's obvious to anyone who knows about the film that it is heavily political and expresses a strong antiwar and antiUS sentiment. Although this sort of thing is nothing new as films like Platoon and Casualties of War have expressed strong political sentiments about another unpopular war  especially antiAmerican sentiments the subject matter of this film sets it apart from those and other war films as the events depicted are supposed to be based on real events that took place in Haditha one tragic day in November of 2005 where 15 non combatants were allegedly killed by Marines in retaliation for a marine being killed in a roadside bomb. In the media the event is called the Haditha Killings or the the Haditha Massacre. Although made to look like a documentary the film is equal parts fact rumor speculation and outright fiction. The writerdirector Nick Broomfield is famous for his documentaries such as Aileen Life and Death of a Serial Killer documenting the life trial and execution of female serial killer Aileen Wuornos. I've always enjoyed Broomfield's documentaries and the way he breaths humanity into his largerthanlife subjects especially Aileen . . . for its unflinching look at an obviously insane woman and the equally insane justice system that is about to execute her. But because of its documentary style there is a certain amount of dishonesty in The Battle for Haditha that I find difficult to accept.The film starts off with Marines driving around listening to heavy metal and then goes into a sequence of 'interviews' in the style of Full Metal Jacket on what the soldiers think of the conflict. It is unanimous that the soldiers don't want to be there and don't understand why they are fighting. Their training is portrayed as extremely brutal and meant to encourage violence. Kill kill kill! is chanted many times. One soldier shows another soldier a war wound that he says could have gotten him discharged with 10 pay but decided to remain in the service so that he could collect his full pay even though he apparently hates the war and feels his country is neglecting him. I don't understand this logic why would one risk their life for low pay in a conflict they didn't believe in for a country they resented rather than simply take an out when it is offered and go get a job in the civilian world? Even a low paying job you don't like would be better than a low paying one that you don't like that is incredibly dangerous.The most interesting part of the film is the portrayal of the Iraqis. While the Marines are demonized and so to are the foreign AlQaeda fighters the Iraqis on the other hand are played as innocent victims. We're introduced to a young Iraqi insurgent who by day runs a video store that sells DVDs to US soldiers while leading a double life where together with his uncle a disgruntled former Iraqi soldier he smuggles weapons and plants roadside bombs. The uncle is pissed off by checkpoints war and the damaged infrastructure of Haditha left by the 2003 invasion. Most of all though he seems angry that when the US disbanded the Iraqi army all he was given was fifty US dollars for his years of service. And so instead he decides to work for another group of foreigners who'll pay him one thousand dollars every time he successfully blows up an American vehicle with a primitive IED. The other characters we're introduced to are a young couple and their child who are on neither side and are simply trying to live their lives as best they can in the midst of war and chaos. They see the insurgents planting a bomb but instead of warning the Americans they tell their Sheik who tells them to pray. They are afraid that if they tell the Americans what the insurgents are planning that they will be targeted and executed by the insurgents.Ultimately the morality of this film portrays the Americans not only as 'shoot first ask questions later' types but also as plain bloodthirsty. They march and chant kill kill kill they sit in their bunks plotting vengeance they're rude to the Iraqis whose country they have invaded they don't understand or care about the cause they are fighting for and they blare heavy metal music everywhere they go. In reality American patrols spend far more time handing out food water medical supplies and gifts to the Iraqis than they do shooting at anyone. I'm not saying there aren't tragedies happening and that there aren't soldiers getting out of line but these are the exceptions. This film tries to portray the exceptions as the rule while ignoring the fact that insurgents routinely and as a matter of policy target civilians in market places and funeral processions. The worst part of this film though is that the tragedy that took place in Haditha is still under investigation it is only a few years since blood was spilled there. This film presents an explanation and a verdict before the smoke has even cleared and it stirs up sentiment that will not help end the conflict in Iraq. Even if there is a full US withdrawal from Iraq the insurgents will still be there. If the US leaves Iraq in the state it is in right now would the Iraqi people be better off living under a group that routinely slaughters innocent men women and children as a matter of policy? Not dealing with these kinds of questions is an injustice to everyone involved in the Iraqi conflict. It is compounded by the fact that it is shot in a documentary style in an attempt to present itself as the truth when it is simply like any other dramatic film just one point of view.".

He has tried to mix documentary and fiction  always a very dubious project. While in many respects its a tough and worthy movie I do feel it has fallen short of its ambitions.He carefully builds up his characters  the ordinary Iraqis going about their business trying to live normal lives. The young Marines are shown most vividly  young men hyped up on testosterone and heavy metal there is a great soundtrack from Ministry. And the Insurgents  a mix of clueless young men Islamic nuts and despairing ex soldiers. The latter is the weakest part of it  the depiction of the insurgents is poorly done with actors speaking lines out of an 'idiots guide to Jahid'. Only one of the insurgents is an interesting individual  the older man an ex soldier apparently driven by despair rather than hatred  I would have liked to see more of this character.The build up to the apparently true incident when marines massacred two families in retaliation for a successful IED attack is tense and the actual incident is realistic  it is particularly good at depicting how men who don't see themselves as evil can carry out a massacre. Broomfield clearly blames a combination of the training and a refusal to see the locals as humans as well as mendacious senior officers. But I have to confess to some misgivings about the depiction  it aims for reality but some parts just lack credibility  spoiler alert For example would experienced ambushers chose a random section of roadway without bothering to work out where their hiding place would be first? Would they really carry guns with them  surely they would just try to blend in with the locals by dressing normally? Its little things like this that make me feel that its not as honest in its attempt at a documentary like seriousness as it likes to think it is.While its a worthy movie and its hard to dispute that the attempt to show even handedness to all sides deserves acknowledgment I found the narrative quite clumsy and the ending was poorly judged. I think this movie would have been better as a straightforward documentary or a piece of 'pure' fiction. The deepest truths about war are often told by more abstract fictional stories such as Apocalypse Now or my personal favorite the Japanese movie Red Angel than attempts to reproduce actual events. It doesn't help that the story is hamstrung by a very didactic approach yes we know war is evil and Bush is a hypocrite we don't need to be told over and over again and only an average script. But the quality of the middle section does make it worthwhile viewing.".

It doesn't help that the story is hamstrung by a very didactic approach yes we know war is evil and Bush is a hypocrite we don't need to be told over and over again and only an average script. But the quality of the middle section does make it worthwhile viewing.";

Now under a new U.S. government it is easy to say mistakes have been made we are doing a much better job now and we can talk about what went wrong. But under the bush era in America this must haven been much more difficult. So a big political thumbs up for the director for picking up the controversial issue at that time. And I think politically he did not do a bad job.The movie follows a group of marines terrorists and families through an incident some months after the battle OF haditha. It does so sometimes at the cost of the tempo but does in my opinion a really good and fair job. not unlike bloody Sunday the historical one and the 2002 movie the situation is a ticking bomb with the terrorists or freedom fighters depends on the perspective setting something up the military triggering it the civil population suffering the consequences and the terrorists ultimately winning the battle by having won more forces than they lost. This surely is an old story but still is a reality. But where the art of realistic filmmaking if it fails might make you a part of this downward spiral this movie succeeds in telling you the whole story. This movie doesn't point fingers at those who were directly involved in the incident. It simply tells how people on either side of both the trigger and the violent struggle got into the situation where they did what they did. So yes this is a very political motivated movie. But not in the sense that it prefers one political view over the other but in the sense that it shows quite realistic what happens to people that have to suffer the consequences not only the civilians. And in the end the movie does point fingers at people. But not at those who were involved in what really happened but at those who orchestrated the conditions in which things like this can happen.This movie tells a story that is difficult to be told. And in my opinion it does a really good job in that. For a really great MOVIE of course there are a lot of things missing. But i think it wasn't the purpose of this movie to be a great movie it was the purpose to tell a story. And in my opinion the story is very well told. Good Movie.".

Unfortunately must of the current Mexican movies are taking the same Hollywood recipe beautiful actors violence soundtracks of well known Latin groups... Batalla en el Cielo does not follow this. The director Carlos Reygadas is a person that really wants to show what he has in mind and does not care about considering distracting elements for having a greater impact in the audience.I am against the use of sex for attracting audience to a film. However I really think that some not all of the sex scenes of this movie were really part of the story. Also showing sex as it is not always as idealistic and esthetic as Hollywood has taught us is an interesting proposal!I consider that one of the main achievements of this movies is to show many cultural traits of my country The view of the Catholic religion as a resource to erase the mistakes one has made you can do whatever you want don't worry about the effects because God will always help you The notorious gap between rich and poor people when Ana refers to Jaime's servant as la gata in such a despective but common way.The double morale managed by Mexican how can a prostitute as Ana can be a moral leader over Marcos's acts? The informal commerce Marcos and his wife sold merchandise in the subway. The love for soccer what can I say about that if I love it? Cheating on your partner The lifestyle in Mexico City with its traffic jams way people behave in the subway neurotic people kidnaps.All the issues above are part of the Mexican life.Personally I consider the following opportunity areas Not all the music that was used was OK. Sometimes it was too belic for me  but at least it is according to the scenes and most of it does not follow the marketing intentions to make you buy a soundtrack The audio quality should have been improved it was not easy to understand even for people used to the way people from Mexico City speak! Some very few! parts were too slow... but considering Reygadas's style I might think that it is part of his professional charm.I like to see a different proposal. I would recommend this film to people that at the time that they leave the theater really want to think about human nature rather than thinking if it was an erotic or violent film.I hope my comment has been useful...".

	schema:reviewBody "Much has been made of the gratuitous opening sequence in Reygadas latest picture. Allow me to dispel any fears this is the most beautiful and resonant pretitle sequence in the past decade. We see the nude Carlos' head and chest and sense it's the prurient clich of the study of a man's naked soul. Reygadas lulls us into this feeling and then slowly pans down to dissolve our preconceptions. The beautiful music beats giving a real sense of emotional turmoil and we pans down to see the almost childlike in terms of size beside Marcos Ana administering fellatio. What could have simply been dismissed as shock tactics is undermined by the unsexiness of the sequence and the music which reaches crescendo as the bored Marcos attains orgasm. The black screened title sequence comes at the peak of the music we are hooked entirely and excited by the emotional resonance produced by the two protagonists about whom we know nothing about. The film is littered with moments wherein the music reaches such a pitch that we cannot but feel for these ostensibly detached and remote characters and therein lies Reygadas skill. The film works on a number of levels parallels are drawn between the rife kidnapping problems in Mexico City and Jesus experiences spent in Hell in the 3 days following his Crucifixion. In Edinburgh Reygadas and his actress Anapola Mushkadiz talked and it was interesting to find how autobiographical his film is. The characters retain their own names and the lead Carlos actually was Reygadas father's chauffeur for many years and an untrained actor. Anapola Mushkadiz who is a quiet little phenomenon has never previously acted and showed little ambition to do so again attributed her performance entirely to Reygadas. Clearly one of the best current directors with influences of Antonioni and Tarkovsky he curiously reflected that his next film would be happier curious his sure touch for the darker reaches in everyday life. Rarely does so subtle and outright thoughtprovoking a film get made.".

The characters often stare at each other with blank faces but they are consistently unemotional. The characters look like real people plucked right off a Mexico City street. The sounds in the film are interesting and graphic sometimes noisy. But it works to keep you in the film. The filming in Mexico City creates an interesting backdrop.

	schema:reviewBody "A refreshing piece for Mexican filmaking that's how I'd described this movie. Nowadays Mexican films try to imitate Hollywood patterns with unfortunate results. Therefore is surprising and exciting to watch a film that walks away from all commercial stereotypes and proposes a new way for filmaking. Though I liked Japn better Reygadas first featurethis film is in many ways different to his past movie. This one is set in the city and an important part of it is the chaos this one has more dialogs but less narrative structure. In fact Reygadas is not trying to tell us a story at all. His films are more of a contemplative nature rather than a story with climax and an established ending. Highly influenced by Abbas Kiarostami Reygadas characters are not played by professional actors they're played by common people that had nothing to do with the entertainment industry. And unfortunately here the results aren't that good as they were on his past film.So you've probably heard about the explicit sexual content. This I think is Reygadas biggest contribution Never before a Mexican film has gone this far on the sex issue. He demonstrates that sex scenes are not supposed to be provocative erotic or stimulating at all they can be grotesque and raw because the important thing is that they look real and are not idealized.However I think the movie has a few weak points the acting is terrible  it looks like that was made on purpose the sound design is horrible and it looks like Reygadas takes 100 min to tell you nothing but oh! what a beautiful way of telling nothing.".

Therefore is surprising and exciting to watch a film that walks away from all commercial stereotypes and proposes a new way for filmaking. Though I liked Japn better Reygadas first featurethis film is in many ways different to his past movie. This one is set in the city and an important part of it is the chaos this one has more dialogs but less narrative structure. In fact Reygadas is not trying to tell us a story at all. His films are more of a contemplative nature rather than a story with climax and an established ending.

Without this it's what could be called audio often heard on radio CD MP3 etc. Interestingly audio is not an absolute requirement for a movie. The second and perhaps what failed this movie is story telling yes that's right an actual story which is told and progresses through the length of the movie. Not a two line blurb that is padded out with numerous shots of nothing. I could end the review there but since I had the strength of character to stay for the length of the movie I think I'll return the compliment.The actual story in this movie if all the other scenes were removed could be told in under five minutes. The rest comprises of long slow moving shots of people walking standing corridors buildings scenery and non too erotic sex. Saying that the story that we are told is minimal are we supposed to be guessing the rest ourselves? I found no desire for the story or the characters so why would I never mind could I from the sparse information given.Now when I talk about slow shots I am talking about a five to ten second slow pan showing a character turn their head one way followed by another long shot of their head turning the other way and the camera turning again. Or the excruciating scenes of characters just standing and looking. It was difficult to wait for the camera to catch up. The movie needed so much more editing as it stand it would bring it down to a short but there were many aspects of the story that could have actually been attempted to be explored on screen even in a minimalist way.When an old man is wheeled out in front of two characters in the street we're treated to an agonising scene mirroring that in The Rocky Horror Picture Show although this is totally serious. It's that moment when the Professor first appears and everyone calls out everyone else's name slowly passing around the room. Funny there painful here.It was also difficult to stay with the most unerotic and uncomfortable sex scenes I've ever seen in my life. During the opening scene we're treated to the main character a somewhat overweight man standing before us naked. The camera pans down his body to what looks like an underage girl engaged in fellatio with tears running down her face. This isn't nice and something I struggled to sit through.It doesn't get better either. A scene of him masturbating to a football match was equally unappealing even though you saw nothing. There's a sex scene later on with the same girl having sex with Marcos the lead and we're treated to a lovely shot of his fading erection and a shot of her vagina. Lovely. Add another fellatio scene between these characters and you're almost celibate. The icing on the cake however is in the scene between Marcos and his wife who is most definitely obese. I struggled.The actors are real people and it shows. They're totally lifeless and did not even engage me. I found myself wondering how much time had passed and wishing for shots to complete rather than watching the same shot for the next ten to fifteen seconds. A feeling I felt once before with The House of Mirth.For me I don't understand the comment I heard later from one critic who thought it was amazing. She was really hung up on whether some inane detail of the plot was known by other characters. Another critic turned to her saying it was truly awful and there was no story yet she loved it and defended the story. The more she talked the more I realised that the story she was talking about existed in her head as an extrapolation of the story that we saw on the screen. Was it that the Director intended us to derive the story from small details interspersed with these shots? I don't like being spoon fed but I would like more than a few crumbs to try and taste the meal.I'd hate to say it's a terrible movie you have to consider the context of the Country's movie industry the Country itself etc. but for me it was dull lifeless and taught to watch.".

	schema:headline " Deliberately paced stylized abundantly empty.";
	schema:reviewBody "I guess I'm going to have to give Reygadas A for effort. What we see on screen certainly LOOKS good. The photography is splendid and the human or humanoid figures are memorable in one way or another. It sounds good too. There's no noticeable score but the situational music ranges from rap through military marches to Bach and the otherwise silent background sometimes is filled with clicking heels peeps and ticks.That's about it for me. The residual impression is a failed attempt at an artistic masterpiece. In the opening scene before the credits we see the inexpressive face of an ordinary middleaged man. The camera always slowly and deliberately moves down his overblown torso and we see the back of some blond woman's head covering his groin her hair sprouting up in ungainly spears and tangles. At a glacial pace the camera sidles sideways and we see explicitly that she is fellating the guy her movements about as unsprightly as the camera's and her eyes are closed. The camera moves verrrry slooowly in until we see only her closed lids. They pop open her irises stare wildly at us and a tear rolls out of one of them and down her cheek.That's not too bad but it's an example of the director's technique at just about its peak. A few other scenes are equally shocking but for the most part watching this is like rolling a giant stone up a hill.There are one or two underlying plots in all this artistry. One has to do with a general's daughter Ana working for kicks in a cathouse. Several people have argued that this is the only way male directors can think about women with sexual appetites which strikes me as a pretty cheap interpretation. Anyway Marco the fat guy we see in the opening scene is her chauffeur and for some reason agrees to get it on with him. They make love joylessly. Marco calm down she tells him as he lies there passively staring at the ceiling. Marco also makes love to his wife a human butterball which is like making love to one of the monumental Mayan pyramids at Chitchen Itza. It's easy to make fun of people who are visually imperfect but you have to give these actors credit for being willing to expose their flawed bodies on screen like this. I can only make these statements because my own physical manifestation is without blemish. Not to say that the young Ana's figure is unusual. She looks pretty good. But all the sex is made to look about as much fun as riding an exercise bicycle. If it were no more alluring a sport than as presented here the human race would have died out thousands of years ago.Well anyway it fits the overall gloom of the other story the one about the child that Marco and his wife kidnapped the child who died while a captive. The climactic scenes bring the problem of guilt and penance to a head but we don't really get to know much about it until halfway through the film and then only through minimalist conversation.You know if you were to play a DVD or a tape of this movie and stop it somewhere at random you'd probably get an image of two people gazing silently at one another. Failing that you can expect a tableau of a dozen or so people standing together motionlessly as if they were dolls placed there by a child staring silently at the camera. There is one spectacular shot in which Ana and Marcos are getting it on and the camera moves verrry slooowly out onto the balcony of the room and then takes us on a slooow tour of the Mexico City neighborhood looking no better and no worse than any other bigcity neighborhood before completing its 360 degree travelogue and returning to the nowexhausted couple on the bed. It reminded me of the spectacular shot towards the end of Michelangelo Antonioni's The Passenger. While Jack Nicholson is getting murdered quietly in his room the camera passes through the bars of the window and takes us on a scenic tour of the street outside before pulling back through the bars and showing us Nicholson's corpse. I got the point of Antonioni's camera movement. The bars in the window were removable so the camera could get outside and replaceable so it could get back in  a selfconscious display of technique. This whole movie reminds me of that shot.Still the visuals are beautiful the film does have its moments and a lot of effort clearly went into the production. So they still use storyboards? Because if they do this was thoroughly storyboarded. If you're in a contemplative and patient mood and if you don't mind quite a lot of experimental technique you should find this film an interesting one.".

	onyx:emotionText "I guess I'm going to have to give Reygadas A for effort. What we see on screen certainly LOOKS good. The photography is splendid and the human or humanoid figures are memorable in one way or another. It sounds good too. There's no noticeable score but the situational music ranges from rap through military marches to Bach and the otherwise silent background sometimes is filled with clicking heels peeps and ticks.That's about it for me. The residual impression is a failed attempt at an artistic masterpiece. In the opening scene before the credits we see the inexpressive face of an ordinary middleaged man. The camera always slowly and deliberately moves down his overblown torso and we see the back of some blond woman's head covering his groin her hair sprouting up in ungainly spears and tangles. At a glacial pace the camera sidles sideways and we see explicitly that she is fellating the guy her movements about as unsprightly as the camera's and her eyes are closed. The camera moves verrrry slooowly in until we see only her closed lids. They pop open her irises stare wildly at us and a tear rolls out of one of them and down her cheek.That's not too bad but it's an example of the director's technique at just about its peak. A few other scenes are equally shocking but for the most part watching this is like rolling a giant stone up a hill.There are one or two underlying plots in all this artistry. One has to do with a general's daughter Ana working for kicks in a cathouse. Several people have argued that this is the only way male directors can think about women with sexual appetites which strikes me as a pretty cheap interpretation. Anyway Marco the fat guy we see in the opening scene is her chauffeur and for some reason agrees to get it on with him. They make love joylessly. Marco calm down she tells him as he lies there passively staring at the ceiling. Marco also makes love to his wife a human butterball which is like making love to one of the monumental Mayan pyramids at Chitchen Itza. It's easy to make fun of people who are visually imperfect but you have to give these actors credit for being willing to expose their flawed bodies on screen like this. I can only make these statements because my own physical manifestation is without blemish. Not to say that the young Ana's figure is unusual. She looks pretty good. But all the sex is made to look about as much fun as riding an exercise bicycle. If it were no more alluring a sport than as presented here the human race would have died out thousands of years ago.Well anyway it fits the overall gloom of the other story the one about the child that Marco and his wife kidnapped the child who died while a captive. The climactic scenes bring the problem of guilt and penance to a head but we don't really get to know much about it until halfway through the film and then only through minimalist conversation.You know if you were to play a DVD or a tape of this movie and stop it somewhere at random you'd probably get an image of two people gazing silently at one another. Failing that you can expect a tableau of a dozen or so people standing together motionlessly as if they were dolls placed there by a child staring silently at the camera. There is one spectacular shot in which Ana and Marcos are getting it on and the camera moves verrry slooowly out onto the balcony of the room and then takes us on a slooow tour of the Mexico City neighborhood looking no better and no worse than any other bigcity neighborhood before completing its 360 degree travelogue and returning to the nowexhausted couple on the bed. It reminded me of the spectacular shot towards the end of Michelangelo Antonioni's The Passenger. While Jack Nicholson is getting murdered quietly in his room the camera passes through the bars of the window and takes us on a scenic tour of the street outside before pulling back through the bars and showing us Nicholson's corpse. I got the point of Antonioni's camera movement. The bars in the window were removable so the camera could get outside and replaceable so it could get back in  a selfconscious display of technique. This whole movie reminds me of that shot.Still the visuals are beautiful the film does have its moments and a lot of effort clearly went into the production. So they still use storyboards? Because if they do this was thoroughly storyboarded. If you're in a contemplative and patient mood and if you don't mind quite a lot of experimental technique you should find this film an interesting one.";

	schema:reviewBody "Battlefield Earth has become something of a legend. It's the Holy Grail of Hollywood crap from the decade if not beyond and is quite possibly that which we do not speak of among scientologists. I was never one to pay much attention to critics I always liked to watch and decide for myself but even I couldn't resist being strayed from any interest by the aura of disdain that surrounded this movie back in 2000. I was 16 then and any scifi adventure movie should've been worth a view but not this one. Now eleven years later I finally sat down to give it a shot and not only does it live up to it's reputation it surpasses it.I was expecting a bad a movie. I was expecting cheesy performances and a weak a script but I got so much more. Battlefield Earth is a garbled mess from start to finish. We begin as you might have guessed on earth. A tribe of cavemanesque people struggle to survive. They're warned of a beast that prowls the land just beyond the horizon and are told of demons that rule the planet. But one brave dude played by Barry Pepper decides there's more out there worth seeing and sets out to prove it. That beast they're all scared of? That's a statue from a long since abandoned minigolf course. And those demons they're always whining about? They're a race of aliens from the planet Psychlo that have enslaved the human populace. For you see this isn't earth billions of years ago but earth in the future where the humans are no longer the dominant lifeforce and it's been so long since they had any power they're not even aware of how badly they got screwed over. This might seem like a spoiler...like I just blew a twist for you...but nope...fear not. Because thanks to a lame subtitle at the opening we already know this is A Saga of the Year 3000 and thanks to some other on screen text that we apparently needed we also already know that the human race is nearly extinct. Which basically means that if you actually managed to get to this movie without having seen any previews you still won't be in for any surprises. Because who wants to be surprised by a movie right? That would be stupid.The basic idea behind this introduction to the world isn't actually bad having us start on what seems like a primitive society and seeing the truth revealed in layers has been done before but it can be effective even in spite of those spoilerific titles at the beginning. The problem though is this information is thrown at us within about 15 minutes of screen time. The whole movie feels very rushed and none of the scenes have any room to breath and we're treated to the same split wipe transition every 5 minutes or so. I won't break down the plot any more than that because there's really no need...let's just say the badguys do some stuff the goodguys get involved and they want to stop being slaves...because well being a slave sucks.The director seems determined to make this movie a visual feast but really doesn't know how. Every camera in the entire movie is tilted which can make for an interesting shot but when EVERY DAMN shot is done the same way it holds no artistic merit what so ever...instead it looks like they were working with a broken tripod. There's really nothing visually interesting about this movie at all except for the establishing shots of the planet Psychlo which is only because they remind you of Blade Runner. In fact I'm pretty sure they just tinted a few shots from Blade Runner purple and cut them into this movie.The aliens are essentially just people with dreadlocks and slightly bigger hairier hands with an extra finger and apparently they're also really stupid. You see they have access to all of Earth's history and the capability to learn how to decipher it but evidently nobody thought it was a good idea which is why they think the favorite meal of a human is uncooked rat and they can't be sure of man's ability to fly without tossing them in the air as a test. To top it all off the alien performances are so goofy they lose all menace. John Travolta and Forest Whitaker have careers full of great performances but with this material they look like a High School theater troupe.There might've actually be a decent story to be mined out of this mess but the people involved just weren't able to find it. I like to give credit where credit is due even in movie's I'm not fond of it's not too often I find a movie with no redeeming qualities to be found but I'm afraid Battlefield Earth just made the list.".

I'll never understand how Travolta managed to get BE made or released for that matter. Why is he tanking his career again? Who knows? After this why should anyone care? Ah well. I hope he finds something better to act in in the future I honestly can't see how he could come up with something worse.I never thought I'd give anything a 1 but this is indeed as worthy a candidate as I've ever seen.

	schema:reviewBody "It was with a certain morbid curiosity and a near certainty that I would be seeing an awful movie that I rented Battlefield Earth and I must say the movie exceeded all of my expectations it is indeed exceptionally terrible. Upon finishing the film I immediately checked to see if Ed Wood had directed it then I remembered he has been dead for some time but no worries Roger Christian is here to take his place.I'm not real sure where to begin because there is nothing good to start with and so much bad to describe but I might as well start from the top. Earth has been taken over by an evil alien race that is scouring the universe for gold....yeah gold don't know why but they want it. Earth has been occupied for a thousand years by these aliens and they are still here searching for gold. They haven't bothered to raid the bank vaults of the world they are too busy digging for the stuff....no really part of the plot later hinges on the humans finding and raiding Fort Knox to supply gold to the aliens to fool them into thinking the humans are mining when they are secretly planning a revolt....I'm not kidding but that comes later.The few remaining humans are savage tribal creatures scratching out a miserable existence as primitive huntergatherers. Later on they learn to fly Harrier jets and dogfight alien ships with only a few days of work they must have been passing down fighter pilot lore for the last ten centuries or so. The main character Jonnie Goodboy Barry Pepper and no I'm not making up that name either leaves the safety of his tribe because he doesn't believe in the aliens and his dad has just died. His dad's death is very emotional even though he never appears on camera is never referred to ever again in the film and the mourning lasts for about three seconds before the cut to the next scene. Anyway he gets captured by the aliens in a shopping mall and taken to their base. There follows a terrible scene where Jonnie Goodboy does battle with the alpha male in the prison population over who gets to eat first Jonnie defeats him and proclaims that everyone will eat at the same time from now on with thunderous cheers from the riff raff....pretty powerful stuff. I've already wasted a lot of time bashing this film so I'll just finish by saying that Jonnie Goodboy gets hooked up to a learning machine becomes really educated learns to fly plans a revolt does a little nuclear engineering and blows up a planet. Pretty good for a guy whose most advanced tools were sticks and rocks earlier in the film. Oh one last thing at least half the film is shot at a fifteen degree angle we're not sure why and once again slow motion doesn't make a bad scene better it just makes it take longer.".

There follows a terrible scene where Jonnie Goodboy does battle with the alpha male in the prison population over who gets to eat first Jonnie defeats him and proclaims that everyone will eat at the same time from now on with thunderous cheers from the riff raff....pretty powerful stuff. I've already wasted a lot of time bashing this film so I'll just finish by saying that Jonnie Goodboy gets hooked up to a learning machine becomes really educated learns to fly plans a revolt does a little nuclear engineering and blows up a planet. Pretty good for a guy whose most advanced tools were sticks and rocks earlier in the film. Oh one last thing at least half the film is shot at a fifteen degree angle we're not sure why and once again slow motion doesn't make a bad scene better it just makes it take longer.";

	schema:reviewBody "I originally wrote a review about this movie after only seeing parts of it. Since I figured that this was unfair and nobody should review a movie without watching it entirely I forced myself to watch it. Oh boy. First a summary of my old first reviewBattlefield Earth was on TV together with another movie that I wanted to watch. The description for both movies looked interesting but after zapping regularly between the two it seemed that BE was just horrible. Every time I switched back from the other movie it was as if nothing had happened. All the scenes looked the same the action scenes were bad the dialogue was horrible and for some reason the movie almost made me feel nauseous. It was like having those typical nightmares I often have when I have a fever where everything repeats endlessly. So eventually I stopped switching channels and watched the other movie.Now after having seen it in its entirety I'm feeling relieved that the rating I originally gave was fully deserved. I rarely give a minimum score but BE is a perfect example of rare awfulness it gets a solid one.The whole thing is just directed and produced horribly. Let me put this straight the story on itself is preposterous  I'll come back to this later on. Yet even a stupid story can make a thrilling movie but Battlefield Earth is not an example of this. The action scenes are all awful it's often impossible to see what happens. The film is full of slowmotion shots but they are used at all the wrong moments. One would expect that closeups and slowmotion would be used to focus on the action but not here the camera often seems to shy away from the actual action. Judging from the poor special effects that can sometimes be seen when the camera does show some action they probably just avoided using SFX altogether. The pacing is also completely off scenes just drag along and are then followed by a pileup of action. Some transitions are so abrupt that it seems like large parts were left on the cutting table but even those parts that survived are all poorly directed. Most of the film is tinted in an exaggerated blue hue which makes all those scenes look like the same scene all over again. The entire movie feels like an episode of a bad scifi TV show from around 1990 stretched to almost two hours.Funny enough I found a perfect explanation as to why Battlefield Earth made me nauseous the first time I watched it. There is almost NO scene in the ENTIRE movie where the camera is NOT tilted. Really what were they thinking? It may look cool when used now and then but it's just ridiculous if every shot is tilted at a random angle. Sometimes subsequent shot changes will make the image tilt from left to right and vice versa so it is entirely possible that watching this film will induce seasickness. This is not the only thing about the camerawork that is awful there is an overuse of closeups and often half of an actor's face is cut off partially due to the tilting. Sometimes we also get closeups of random objects as if they are of great significance but they aren't.The acting is bad not abysmally bad but bad enough not to be able to compensate for the rest of the awfulness. Travolta does a decent job but fails to drag this film out of the abyss.The special effects probably looked OK back in 2000 except for the 'blaster' shots which would only have managed to awe an audience in 1980. But even the other effects look very dated now it's hard to believe that movies like The Matrix are even older than Battlefield Earth. There is an obvious reference to the 'falling through glass' scene from Blade Runner at the start of the movie but it is filmed so poorly that it was more like an insult to BR than a homage.Now by far the worst thing about this movie is its plot. It's not just full of gaping holes even with all the holes patched it still is an insult to viewers. Battlefield Earth is rated PG13 but ironically enough the only people who might appreciate it would be at most twelve years old because they might still be able to muster enough suspension of disbelief. The first two thirds of the film are not entirely ridiculous and could have been saved by an awesome ending. However the actual ending was ten times worse than the most preposterous thing I have ever seen in any other movie. Even the nuking the fridge scene from Indiana Jones 4 seemed plausible in comparison. Even though I rate Battlefield Earth a 1 meaning never ever watch this I would still recommend watching it if you want to see amazing stupidness. Mind that the rest of the movie will make you hurl but if you enjoy laughing at ridiculousness that wants to take itself seriously it could be worth it.The only thing that is remotely OK is the musical score but only when considered on its own. Some scenes where nothing of much importance happens are accompanied by music that would be appropriate during a frantic fighting scene. By the time the actual fighting begins the music fails to add any tension no matter how thrilling it is.Overall Battlefield Earth is a complete failure and it deserves to be in the Bottom 100.".

That he was able to con 10 other people into investing 80 million towards the making of this movie is the only real impressive angle I can work for this review. Perhaps Travolta wanted to work with Tarrantino again and thought the only way that that could happen is if his own career fell into the tank? Or perhaps he felt it was his duty to make the film in order to get a better seat in 'Dianetics Heaven'? Let's hope that Tom Cruise can learn from Barbarino's mistake. I don't think it will matter too much to point out everything that is bad about this film but the acting the dialog the special effects the plausibility of the cave people's quick learning development and of course the hair extensions will just have to suffice.I would have given the movie a 1 out 10 rating but I did laugh at the movie quite a few times and that should be worth something I think. The version I watched was on the USA network and it was modified for teevee so I may have missed some key plot elements that were cut from the original vision of its director but then again I may have seen some really good Levitra adds in its place. The end credits whizzed by so quickly that it would appear that no one really wanted to have anything to do with this movie except Travolta.'In preparing a judgment of worth I proclaim this lame movie to be worst' Don't forget that 'I told ya' to blame John Travoltaand L.

Although the movie starts funny as we can see Travolta and Whitaker argue in their silly suits about slaves this quickly turns to boredom. The rest of the movie is the standard very bad short on budget Sifi that can't interest any viewer with an IQ above sea level at all. The horrible thing is that the director hasn't even tried to convince you as the main character suddenly learns geometry ok and teaches it to his barbarian mates huh? who immediately appreciate the essence of it all they ate raw meat as they have just learned what fire is. But then suddenly the standard IQ of these people goes skyhigh They understand atom bombs know how to fly a Mig and work with highly cryptic computer interfaces. Check out the fact that the main character discovers the national library and finds a crisp fresh version of the constitutional law it has been in that very same destroyed library for almost 1000 years and doesn't show any signs of decay ?

I thought the critics were exaggerating when they said how bad it was but they werent BATTLEFIELD EARTH is one of the worst films released by a major Hollywood studio.

He perhaps would have been slightly too old for the part but at least he does have some charisma unlike Pepper  and has one of the worst scripts ever written. An alien race called Psychlos  sounds just like psychos  I bet they re really evil and cruel . Oh they are evil and cruel just like psychos . Why do they think rats are the favourite food of humans when its the only thing theyve seen humans eat ? And why do they think  Rat brains  is an insult to humans ? especially when they consider the  man animals  to be a primitive species . And am I alone in finding the term  Man animals  irritating ? Surely it should be  Manimals  ? A far sharper and clever expression . But sharp and clever is no way to describe this script . Cities stand almost intact after a thousand years since the collapse of human civilisation ! Not only that but so do large amounts of firearms  ammo and Harrier jump jets  and a flight simulator for the jump jets where the humans learn to fly within a week  and no doubt theyll learn what petrol is and learn to put it in the jets in order to fly them . Does this sound very likely to you ? Let me put it this way Go into a time machine and go back to the biblical times  capture a few dozen people  bring them back to the present and get them to become fighter pilots within the week. Do you think theyd be any good flying planes and shooting down enemy forces ? Me neither . Do you think they could overthrow a superior civilisation ? Me neither ?

	schema:reviewBody "El Ron is a genius of Biblical proportions.I learned the following After mankind has descended into near extinction he will begin to make animal sounds grunting and whatnot just as the apes do... or 'did' however maintaining such catch phrases as Piece of cake. Grunting is a universal language as well just like English which has survived 1000 years intact. Even the various tribes of man will speak the same dialect and have no trouble communicating and organizing a revolution. Grunting is instrumental in fooling your captors.The only animal to survive the last thousand years besides humans are horses and rats and the horses kept their saddles.There is no humor in the future.The only people who can survive an alien invasion and subsequent enslavement andor isolation are Caucasian. Asians Africans Latinos and various others went extinct long ago. For some reason though there are one or two in the movie without any explanation as to how they would come to be. There is no humor in the future. Those races do exist among the aliens however and as portrayed by Forest Whitaker are complete morons and inferior to the Caucasians and in his case inferior to humans.There are massive stores of gold in Washington D.C. close to where they keep the Harrier jets and suitcase nukes.Euclidean Geometry is simple.Having leverage over someone is everything. If you have leverage you can do whatever you like and they will stand dumbfounded while listening to you explain your leverage in great detail. Even if you show them your leverage and they threaten you with a beam weapon they won't shoot because you have leverage.If you happen across a weapons warehouse there will be power on to essential things like the flight simulator the projector and the nuclear weapons batteries will be fully charged and all futuristic looking. Be careful with the bomb though the trigger is on the inside somewhere around a fuse that says warning... there is no humor in the future but if you remove it you'll be fine for a few minutes just enough time to show it to everyone.Time and space are altered a bit every now and then time will inexplicably slow down.Sometimes the evil aliens race will use the beam gun but most of the time they'll use the same gun to shoot a physical projectile. There seems to be no difference between the two except for their marksmanship. When using the beam gun they will hit you every time you need not even try to run. When using the flashbang weapon they simply can't hit you instead laying waste to your surroundings.Anyone can fly a Harrier jet.The glass that the aliens use for the dome appears to be almost a foot thick as it hits the ground but this doesn't change the impact of a couple boxes of ammunition and explosives from causing a severe chain reaction when detonated from a central location on top of the dome. The dome will quite neatly implode and very little debris will actually hit the ground just enough for dramatic effect. Time will be altered at these moments so you can get a good look at how thick the glass is. There is no humor in the future.I forgot to mention that when you implode the dome various buildings will start blowing up... for no particular reason.Blowing an aliens arm off will only perplex him and make him docile.Vaporize means to kill or behead and it's not funny because there is no humor in the future.If you learn the alien language and you are the only human to do so rest assured that humans have lost all intellectual curiosity and will never bother asking you what they are saying or ask what you are discussing with them. They will stand by and seem content to let you handle everything.When you blow up a massive planet instead of turning into a star or imploding as you might expect it will disintegrate completely. It's former mass will somehow alter space in such a way as to have no relativistic implications like causing a black hole or even leave debris.Men will outnumber women some 10 to 1.Batteries fuel and various other seemingly limitedshelflife things  from our current understanding of them  will last several hundred or even thousands of years as long as they aren't used.Because man is so primitive and needy machismo is a thing of the past so is humor. If there is a perceived leader no one will question his authority. Not to mention if you jokingly ask about his woman and where she might be he will attack you. There is no humor in the future.There is no humor in the future.These are only a few of the things I became to know while viewing this masterpiece. No wonder Scientology is the greatest religion ever. One day I hope to be rich and famous so that I too can become a Scientologist. Once I am a Scientologist I will make movies about it. I will prove once and for all that all other ScienceFiction is nonsense and incorporate everything I learned from L. Ron Hubbard into my movies which everyone will watch because I am famous. I will even act in these movies I'd like to play the hero but if by the time I am rich and famous I am too old to do so... I'll just play the bad guy. Everyone will take me seriously because I am famous. When you are rich and famous it is implied that you are smart therefore you are worthy of being listened to. Just look at Tom Cruise he has plenty of leverage.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is the year 3000. Many years have passed since the world was conquered by an evil race called the Psychlos in order that they would strip it of its resources just as they had countless other planets. Man has been forced back to the Stone Age slowly dying out in small ineffective pockets of resistance around the world. Sent out from his community Jonnie Goodboy Tyler stumbles across two other survivors who tell him of a place of the gods  a place that turns out to be a former city. While resting overnight the group is come across by the Psychlos and both Jonnie and Carlo are captured. A plot by one of the Psychlos to outsmart his bosses who have deserted him on earth by turning down his bid for a transfer opens the door for Jonnie to learn a great deal about his new masters and gradually he becomes the last real hope for mankind.Being a film critic must be a hard job to do at times. Many of the films you watch will not be brilliant nor will they be terrible  most will be OK and nothing more. Therefore when reviewers get a chance to gush they generally take it. Likewise when a bad film does come to the big screen and reviewers get to see it they often will take great pleasure in putting the boot it  we see it with at least one big budget film each year 2004 was Catwoman. So I usually will try and view a really panned film because I am aware that sometimes the critics are just being unfair  however most of the time I'll wait until it comes to TV to make that decision. With Battlefield Earth I must concede that it is a pretty bad film  but maybe not as bad as the many critics all said although it would be easy to just keep kicking it in the same way as everyone else does.The film does have some very basic ideas that offer potential but these are squandered with a script that bulks out with bad dialogue poor story development and an overall poor delivery that makes it a film that is certainly a mess if not 'the worst film of all time'. The story quickly goes wrong by making massive plot jumps with its two threads Jonnie and Terl that it quickly becomes tiresome. It is not just that major parts of it make little sense even if you are trying to get into it it is also that the film makes it harder for itself by taking itself so seriously. If the film had been exciting and entertaining then I could have forgiven these jumps but the way it holds itself in such high regard means we have to meet it on its own terms  something that I found nigh on impossible to do with this. Whenever we are asked to accept that planes would have survived intact over 1000 years or that anyone could learn to fly them in a matter of days then it is really asking too much if it also expects me to take it 100 seriously at the same time.The film has clearly had money spent on it and it isn't that the effects look bad it is more that they feel overdesigned. The Psychlos crp name look like nobody knew when to stop adding bits and they do look a bit absurd  like a Klingon but with more bits! Similarly the transport craft and alien sets all feel like somebody has just ripped off other films and then tried to combine them the end result is the look of a cheap scifi that looks like it is a scifi film as opposed to a 'real' futuristic world. It is hard to describe and maybe I'm doing it badly but to me the film looked like the alien future's of a thousand scifi movies not an alien future that exists outside of late night TV and as such it was even less engaging. Of course it didn't help that the direction was so ham fisted that Christian should be asked to return his Oscar out of good will. The opening action scene is delivered in a terrible slow motion that sucked all the potential out of it  a technique that is sadly used for most of the action scenes. The stuff with the harriers near the end is so silly that even a good director couldn't have saved it but Christian is not a good director here and he makes it worse and robs it of any excitement or pace it may have had.With such a poor product to sell to us even an all star cast would have struggled  so imagine the trouble that one fading star and a collection of minor support actors have with it. Travolta tries hard but he can find nothing of value. He looks terrible and his performance is just soobvious and easy  there is nothing to watch here partly due to him but also to the wider failings of the film. Pepper was a very strange choice for such a big role and try as he might he cannot get past the absurdity of the whole thing and he comes across as part of the silliness taking his character way too seriously for the material  but I suppose he was only matching the mood of the film. Whitaker has nothing to do and even an appearance from the likable lowrent baddie Kim Coates brought nothing to the film. I don't even know the rest of the cast by name but suffice to say that none of them can do anything worth seeing.Overall this is a very poor film and although I don't wish to join the mob by just kicking it I didn't find any reason not to. The direction is awful but is at its worst in the action scenes. The effects are not awful they just feel like generic overdone scifi fare with little or no imagination  a big surprise when you consider that the director was nominated for an Oscar for Alien and won one for Star Wars for the very discipline of art direction! The script is clunky and the story full of moments that are at best illogical and at worst silly stupid and laughable. The end result is a product that is a real mess with almost nothing of value in it. It is relentlessly shoddy and I almost wish the 'worst film ever' hype would drop off just so that this film could slowly fade from our memory and be lost in time.".

	schema:headline " There aren't words for how terrible this is.";
	schema:reviewBody "It's a movie that's so bad it must be seen to be believed. But I don't recommend you do that. Not unless you're a glutton for punishment.I'll just spend most of this review talking about the biggest plot holes and complete fallacies in this movie. Without even going in to detail regarding all of the terrible angle shots bad directing and acting ridiculous plot points. Let's pretend they were all good and just focus on this movie's biggest problems. It would STILL be a horrible movie.There's this bit about how the Psychlos took little time in destroying the world's militaries. Terl says that that when the initial invasion kicked off ALL of the planet Earth's militaries lasted a total of nine minutes against the Psychlos. Nine whole minutes. Fast forward to present times and all it takes is a few dozen primitive schlubs a couple of weeks of fighter pilot training and NOW the psychlos can be defeated? Does anyone else see a gigantic logical fallacy here? It is completely impossible to suspend disbelief enough to believe that even if they were to become extremely lazy and lax that a military that absolutely decimated that of an entire planet's could succumb so easily to a bunch of humans who've been reduced to a medieval state. This is completely impossible to believe.In Independence Day they at least ATTEMPTED to make it somewhat believable that a crash course in fighter jet training would work as the pilots at the end of the movie had previous experience. Even THAT movie was far fetched. But unlike Battlefield Earth it was still good enough in other areas to warrant a decent reception.I also had a real problem with the bit about the nuclear device causing the ENTIRE planet to explode. It's also consistent with the fact that such a technologically advanced race had supposedly never harvested nuclear energy and never saw any accidents or nuclear explosions from it. This is on the level of Signs stupid. Seriously there needs to be some semblance of logic here. Neither Battlefield Earth nor Signs had any. However unlike Signs Battlefield Earth was rightfully panned. But let's not forget the entire Fort Knox bit. Yes a race of aliens who look to strip resources from the planet Earth the MOST important resource of all being GOLD didn't know about Fort Knox. Seriously? Assuming they didn't study the planet before they invaded you mean to tell me that at no point in the Psychlo's reign of terror did it ever come out about Fort Knox? No terrified human ever let it slip? No documents revealing it's location ever surfaced? It's not as if Fort Knox is a gigantic secret among humans. Virtually every American knows that it's home to one of the largest gold depositories in the world. And yet at no point during this entire enslavement had it ever come out? I REFUSE to believe that a race of aliens whose biggest mission of all was the mining of gold would not have learned about Fort Knox one way or another. That it took years in to this broken future for the humans to finally reveal it. Again no logic whatsoever. The complete impossibility to suspend disbelief.There was potential here. But the execution was just awful. Good premise potentially but terrible script direction and too many plot holes. There's more than I even listed like the part where they disarmed Terl only to rearm him moments later. UGH. This movie is AWFUL. Painfully awful. You'd have to really have a gonzo for some mindless scifi action sequences to want to watch this. In which case you might as well just watch the last 20 minutes or so. But really just avoid it altogether.".

	schema:headline " The Worst SciFi film ever created";
	schema:reviewBody "I must admit it was only recently I actually came across this film. The first clip I saw was the scene in the bar where John Travolta's character 'Terl' says his infamously cheesy While you were still learning how to spell your name I was being trained to conquer galaxies line. The clip was on the YouTube video 100 top cheesiest quotes and at first I didn't recognise the fact that it was John Travolta giving this atrociously cheesy line and instead thought it was a secondary character or a comic relief so I dug further in and decided to have a stab at watching this hoping to God that it was what I had suspected. It was not and in fact it was much worse than that.The main problems with this film can be summed up in a few wordsEverything...The acting is an absolute joke there's no character development John Travolta makes himself out to be a complete doombrain the special effects have nothing special to them the story is more convoluted and nonsensical than anything ever written and whatever's left of this steaming pile of mess is probably a joke as well. At first I had high expectations to this film but turns out I was wrong on so many levels.Let me elaborate on my above points everyone in this movie especially John Travolta over acts their parts to the point of extremity so much so that every scene is almost laughable. There is no character development no proper run in as to he character's situation you're just expected know before hand what is going on which you can't because there's not enough of a backstory for you to build on. The special effects look like they were made on Flash Player 2004 the story makes no sense with so many plot holes such as essential savages being able to learn in the window of a few days how to arm guns and fly Harrier Jump Jets and how an entire Global Military force could not defeat the aliens yet 6 Harrier Jump Jets could take them down with ease. But this point is only trivial compared to some of the other points of idiotic interest you can pick out from this film. And probably my most irritating point is the fact that 99 of the shots are at an angle which makes the movie almost unwatchable to begin with. Was the director's neck stuck at an angle so the only way he could tell what was going on was to have the camera's at an angle too? Really no need for it.Overall this was just a big waste of time and money that somehow made it into the cinemas. I mean for what was supposed to be an overly serious movie about the last fight of Mankind against aliens this actually seems pretty comical I mean John Travolta is essentially a one man comedy show with his overacting a real gem of cinema there folks!".

All those years and years of training pilots when all that was needed was a bunch of ignorant quasiNeanderthals and some hours in a flight simulator...I don't know which was the worst move casting lead actor Barry Pepper who probably can't even spell charisma trying to pass off Dallas Alien style as scifi action or actually financing this project. The script is on the same level as the stuff I wrote when I was ten and I think that someone should have noticed that.

Alien Terl from a race that is incidentally so stupid I'm surprised they manage to get dressed in the morning. Instead of killing a rebellious slave the aliens decide to teach him their language. How? By pumping him full of human history and science and then letting him read up on the missing bits. That should be harmless enough right? It's not like knowledge ever gave anyone power. And why would even more slaves want to rebel? But then again how were the aliens supposed to know that the group of stickwielding superstitious grunting cave men knew how to fuel prep arm and fly Harriers? That was just pure bad luck. Also having fighter jets that are evidently perpetually dusted off and refueled in a hanger that is perpetually powered by... the gods or... or something? That's clearly cheating.In the end there's really only one reason to watch this and that's if you're a person planning on writing your own scifi or other story and wants advice on what not to do.

	schema:reviewBody "I watched Battlefield Earth today. Um yay? If you don't already know Battlefield Earth is considered the worst movie of all time. When my dad and I recorded it on the DVR I was thinking Oh boy this is going to be hilarious. Is it hilarious? Yes. Is it bad? Yes. Is it painful to watch? Oh yeah. Those who haven't seen this movie may be wondering What's so bad about it? I'm wondering Where do I even start? How about we start at the plot. It's garbage. Basically a race of aliens called the Psychlos take over Earth following a nine minute battle yes nine minutes. A thousand years later the last remaining humans become huntergatherers. But the Psychlos come back to use the Earth as a mining facility. Terl played by John Travolta is furious for not being allowed to return to his home planet decides to use the humans to mine gold for himself. But one dude named Jonnie Goodboy Tyler decides to revolt with the other prisoners. Huh. Is it just me or is that really stupid? Plus there are really idiotic plot elements that are impossible and hilarious. For example A group of tribal men who was never even mentioned until halfway into the movie get into a flight simulator and train to take down the Pyschlos. About an hour later there going all Star Wars fighter jet on them. How is that even possible? It takes years to learn how to fly how were they able to master it in one day? There's more but if I talked about all the mistaken plot elements it would become really really long. This movie is also based on Scientology. It's a controversial religion made by L. Ron Hubbard. It is according to dictionary.com a belief based on a person being an immortal spiritual being whose survival depends on himher and hisher attainment of brotherhood with others and the universe. Not only is that A fake but it's also B stupid and C a horrible excuse for a plot element. I swear there are so many things wrong with the story of this movie. The acting is really bad which is kind of sad because some of them are decent actors. Like the main character. Is he a decent actor? Yes. Did he do a good job in this movie? No. No he didn't. But no one not a single actor could compare to the sheer awfulness of John Travolta. Terl is the most obnoxious annoying stupid douchebag of a character I have ever seen in my life. He thinks humans are stupid he's the smartest alien ever and has the gut busting cackle. After watching this movie I started literally hating John Travolta. When you think of a scifi movie you think of CGI. Yes Battlefield Earth has it but it sucks. I've seen Bmovies with better special effects than this movie. Everything looks fake the lasers are copypaste with a ripple effect when it hits the explosions lack impact the scenery is bland and the flight simulator scenes look like an alpha stage of an FPS game. It just looks bad. The cinematography is some of the worst I've ever seen. It gets way to close to their faces and looks like it's filmed at a sideways angle. Plus the editing is really choppy. There are way to many unnecessary slow motion scenes. I swear there are at least 70. Plus some lines of dialogue are repeated more than once in an overly dramatic way and some just come out with no sound whatsoever. And the transitions to the next scene are literally the exact same every time! Iit just RRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGHH!!! Speaking of dialogue that's something else that sucks in this movie. Everything that everyone says is really cheesy. Some of the lines are totally unnecessary too. The most unnecessary come from John Travolta. Everything he says is dumb. Literally. Every. Sentence. Overall this movie is like a bomb detonating in your stomach. If there's anything redeemable about this movie it's the soundtrack which is somewhat decent I use that term loosely. This is one of those movies that you don't watch because you want to enjoy quality film. You would want to watch this if you're with your friends and you like to make fun of terrible movies. As a BMovie it would have been decent because of its humor yes the movie is pretty unintentionally funny. As a full fledged movie in theaters with box office numbers which it is it is an abomination for the eyes. Do not watch unless you're ready to make fun of it. That's the only way you'll get entertainment out of this piece of crap.".

He spent dozens of hours in a helicopter over Bavaria only shortly interrupted by short pauses in which he shows images of a few larger cities or certain points of interest or to show images of typical Bavarian tradition and watching the beautiful images they are simply great and show the beauty of our homeland. But still  a lot of things are missing and some of the text spoken by the director himself leave a foul taste.... To the things missing there are almost no informations to Bavarian history. The traditions shown in the film are mainly catholic Christian traditions besides there is a lot more in Bavaria than the Oktoberfest. There is a clear dominance to the city of Munich more than a fourth of the film which is the hometown of the director but Bavaria is definitely not only Munich! And two of the more peripheral regions of the country of Bavaria the Oberpfalz and the Allgu or Bavarian Swabia are only mentioned very shortly typical for the pure Bavarian that considers himself somehow to be in the middle of everything. And this is where the film and some of the director's remarks leave a bad taste he mentions Bavaria to be the Land with the most economic power in Europe the best of the world  come on I am a Bavarian but mainly I'm German! Germany is a independent country not Bavaria it's just a part of Germany. And Germany  like all countries  has other beautiful places as well. A certain patriotism is good but I personally despise this strong feeling of Bavarian supremacy. In conclusion beautiful pictures no equilibrium in documentation lack of historic details other people of Bavaria than the dominating Bavarians and Frankonians clearly underrepresented. And someone outside Bavaria will definitely be disgusted by this tone of Bavarian supremacy. At school the teacher would say insufficient work Grade E or Note 5 in Germany sit down.".

Beginning with a trip to the Alaska wilderness we meet Carol Stefanie Von Pfetten and her companion Dr. Lee Helm Jeremy London who have come to visit an eminent archaeologist Dr. Owen Standford Scott Hylands who has discovered one of four ancient amulets. Although the find is dangerous the mad doctor becomes obsessed with their combined power as it will activate the wrath and power of the ancient Sumarian god. The film then has our heroes gallivanting around the globe chased by an assortment of characters like the F.B.I. Commander Kittrick Michael Kopsa of the Canadian government and the director of the museum. One need not see the entire movie to notice all the inaccuracies within the film. Granted the mistakes are obvious the movie does get a couple points like the impressive special effects and the near resemblance of the hero to Brandon Frasier. The conclusion is although it's a badly constructed movie it's entertaining enough to warrant a looksee. ".

	schema:reviewBody "This was looked like a cheap Digupoldthingsandpeopledie boilerplate MadScientist flick.But wait. . .Old Archaeologist Mad starts digging up buried amulets except he's not after them for Archaeologist fame. By the time the other scientists realize he's Mad and up to no good the God of Storms is already wrecking havoc and creating superstorms.Meanwhile a Gov't Weather Watch bureau is tracking the unexplained storm growths and trying to dispel them without sparking an international War. The meteorological handwavium isn't overwhelming but adds enough of a scientific pseudoexplanation of a supernatural event to give a facile ring of believability to the story.The God Ba'al itself is pretty cool. It's done well as a nice FX. And it's plausible Ba'al is supposed to be a God not a creature. And on the ground the viewer is taken along on a nicely timed buildup of tension as the Mad Archaeologist keeps skipping ahead of everyone to get the next amulet.This movie is a wellturned gem of a lite Friday Night popcorn thriller that doesn't fall into the rut of cheap ridiculousness. So within its merits this MadeForCable B movie is darn good!Now having said that. . .this Movie doesn't win any awards this Movie isn't a packthahouse blockbuster this Movie isn't tourdeforce Cinema. People it's JUST LITE ENTERTAINMENT!! Don't try to be a New York Times Critic! Just Watch it! I call this one a Friday Night flick for a reason Powerhouse flicks are for Saturdays in my book. And for you Military Buffs out there remember that most of us civvies don't know a Lieutenant from a Corporal. If Military Rank Inaccuracies bother you that much don't watch this one.Oh. . .and this movie is Kidfriendly and Girlfriend Neutral.".

	onyx:emotionText "This was looked like a cheap Digupoldthingsandpeopledie boilerplate MadScientist flick.But wait. . .Old Archaeologist Mad starts digging up buried amulets except he's not after them for Archaeologist fame. By the time the other scientists realize he's Mad and up to no good the God of Storms is already wrecking havoc and creating superstorms.Meanwhile a Gov't Weather Watch bureau is tracking the unexplained storm growths and trying to dispel them without sparking an international War. The meteorological handwavium isn't overwhelming but adds enough of a scientific pseudoexplanation of a supernatural event to give a facile ring of believability to the story.The God Ba'al itself is pretty cool. It's done well as a nice FX. And it's plausible Ba'al is supposed to be a God not a creature. And on the ground the viewer is taken along on a nicely timed buildup of tension as the Mad Archaeologist keeps skipping ahead of everyone to get the next amulet.This movie is a wellturned gem of a lite Friday Night popcorn thriller that doesn't fall into the rut of cheap ridiculousness. So within its merits this MadeForCable B movie is darn good!Now having said that. . .this Movie doesn't win any awards this Movie isn't a packthahouse blockbuster this Movie isn't tourdeforce Cinema. People it's JUST LITE ENTERTAINMENT!! Don't try to be a New York Times Critic! Just Watch it! I call this one a Friday Night flick for a reason Powerhouse flicks are for Saturdays in my book. And for you Military Buffs out there remember that most of us civvies don't know a Lieutenant from a Corporal. If Military Rank Inaccuracies bother you that much don't watch this one.Oh. . .and this movie is Kidfriendly and Girlfriend Neutral.";

After all it's a SEA people. Sebastopol isn't ever visible from Turkey not even on a clear day. Plus BC Parks information boards don't mark archaeological sites on the Turkish Black Sea.

They're so important to the Jewish people that Israel doesn't let them out of the country not even on tour. They have squat to do with Sumeria and the Hebrew alphabet was invented a millennium later. The Sumerians wrote on clay in cuneiform. Finally the Dead Sea Scrolls are not written on stiff handtooled cowhide. They're written in ink on fragile sheepskin parchment that sometimes took a year to unroll. See them for yourself at the Shrine of the Book.I can forgive a low budget if the actors and screen writers turn in a decent effort. Nobody shows up for work in this turkey. The actors don't even try to make the stilted dialogue work. Lexa Doig turns in a particularly shameful performance substituting a deerintheheadlights expression for emotion.

So rather than it being mother nature that will destroy the planet it's a supernatural being wielding the power of mother nature.Suffice to say I changed channel without watching the whole thing.Unless you really like one of the actors in this film I can't see why anyone would want to watch it.".

For me the guy that stands out the most is Hans the Scandinavian guywho according to him isnt a looker but gets allor some of the chicks.

Marc Singer is great in the title role. If he were to cure world hunger create world peace or even be elected president he would still be known as The Beastmaster. Tanya Roberts doesn't really do much but looks damn nice doing it John Amos is also good as a traveler who befriends Dar and Rip Torn is as overthetop as he can get. Lee Holdridge's score composed in a short amount of time provides a bit more epicness than the film could have created on its own with a heroic theme that is used throughout.

	schema:reviewBody "As far as the Sword and Sorcery genre goes this is it's shining star. A lot of people comment in negative waysbad acting poor costumes etc.but the're missing the point of this film style. Let me summarize A man's village is slaughtered by a cult called the Jun Horde. He seeks revenge on them and follows their trail. He discovers he can communicate with animals and travels with them. He also picks up some human companions along the way including superhot Tonya Roberts. Each one has their own reason to defy the Jun Horde. This revenge theme is typical of S  S films musclebound hero love interest cool sidekicks evil wizard etc.. But this movie is loaded with creative and original material. Animal costars at least three very skilled actorsJohn Amos in particular an incredible soundtrack supercool throwing weapons and an emotional character. Conan came only months earlier and had a much bigger budget. Even with that it pales in comparison to the much superior Beastmaster. All Conan does is mope and get angry the only time he's even likable is when he's drunk. Plus everything he does is for himself. Dar on the other hand risks his life to save strangers. He even reveals himself while unarmed to save a child. He can talk to animals but doesn't control them. They are viewed as his friends not servants a good message if you ask me. He even turns down his birthright so he can live his own life. Conan Dragonslayer Ator etc. used fake animals to engage the actors. The Beastmaster had two ferrets a tiger an eagle horses doves and more interacting with very believable screenpresence. Even the scenes involving the tiger attacking the actors looked convincing. Dar also has a sense of humor and isn't afraid to cry. What's more instead of having the bad guys on one side and the good guys on the other you have many gray areas in between. The bat people the priests the guards the people who live inside town the ones that live outside the ancient sect that used to live in the temple the witches the death guards the Jun Horde even the animals themselves all have their own outfits motivations and behaviors. This makes it a rich tapestry and very interesting to watch. The characters are layered so that they appear and disappear at the right time every time. The scene involving the fire was real fire they didn't have to rely on fancy overbudgeted special effects. The only thing that comes close in this genre is Ladyhawke. It is a wonderful movie and the only reason I didn't give it a tenten is the scene where Tonya Roberts appears from the back of the skull in the temple. They never explained how she got there or why she and Dar couldn't escape the way she came.".

This makes it a rich tapestry and very interesting to watch. The characters are layered so that they appear and disappear at the right time every time. The scene involving the fire was real fire they didn't have to rely on fancy overbudgeted special effects. The only thing that comes close in this genre is Ladyhawke. It is a wonderful movie and the only reason I didn't give it a tenten is the scene where Tonya Roberts appears from the back of the skull in the temple. They never explained how she got there or why she and Dar couldn't escape the way she came.";

	schema:reviewBody "Following Conan the Barbarian there were a lot of Barbarian trash movies in the 1980s. The best of them all was Beastmaster because it had creative production design colorful photography and even some ideas of its own. Dar the Beastmaster Marc Singer can see through the eyes of animals and command them whenever he needs help. The evil priest Maax Rip Torn holds Dar's father the king prisoner as well as the slave girl Kiri Tanya Roberts whom Dar fell in love with. In this actionpacked movie we meet a lot of bizarre folks like the scary batmen who can suck their victims dry if they catch them under their wings and still these are some of the good guys! or the berserkers who carry green worms in their brains to drive them crazy. Directorscript writer Coscarelli was also in charge of the very successful horror movie Phantasm and that shows in the darker scenes. Tanya Roberts looked so good in rags she went on to make Sheena with equally little to wear. Marc Singer's muscles were memorable enough to get him signed many years later for 2 sequels which weren't half as good as the original but still way better than the politically correct TV series 20 years later. Comparing the 113 minutes director's cut British DVD to the old 91 minutes German video tape version these are the most important scenes previously omitted 1 8 12 minutes of introduction in which we learn how Maax was threatened by the king hears the prophecy about the king's unborn son and asks a witch to abduct the baby from his mother's womb!. Probably it was felt it takes too long until we see the grownup hero. The disadvantage is that we know less in the short version about Maax and his motives. 2 Still in the first third of the movie a funny scene was cut in which Dar falls into quicksand needs help from the animals  and rescues one of them in return. This scene is a charming illustration of the beginning of his friendship with the animals but not necessary to understand the story. 3 In the last third of the movie 3 scenes were cut in which the injured young prince is carried into a house gets better and receives a gift from the Beastmaster. It seems this was cut as it slows down the movie and gives information about the boy only  who is not one of the main characters anyway. There are also smaller cuts along the way sometimes due to violence. Anyhow go get The Beastmaster in this longer version!".

And as I purchased the DVD in 2013 and revisited the movie for another watching I can honestly say that I enjoy it as much today as I did back then.This is a classic tale of sword and sorcery. An infant is rescued from a ritual offering and grow up on the plains with herders and huntsmen fully unaware of his royal heritage. Growing up Dar discovers that he has abilities that allow him mastery over animals and being capable of communicating with them. Drawn into a game of treachery and heroism Dar have to take up the fight against the vile sorcerer Maax.Sure this was shot back in 1982 but it was a blast then and it is actually quite fun to watch even in 2013. The effects were adequately back then and serves their point straight on. However don't prepare to be dazzled by today's standards. But if you are a fan of the sword and sorcery genre then The Beastmaster is a sure mustwatchmovie.The people cast for the various roles did good jobs with their given roles and I don't really remember Marc Singer as being that buffed and muscular when I saw him in the original V series. But he was really wellcast for the role of DarThe Beastmaster. Even the animals trained for the movie were doing good jobs.The Beastmaster is a an excellent sword and sorcery movie and a very formidable choice of movie to the Conan movies. I thoroughly enjoy this 1982 movie and I know that I will put it back in the DVD player again after some years.".

The beastmaster is the kind of movie that studios love because it cost about 4 million dollars to make and it works. I recently watched the directors cut with full commentary and didn't realise how involved this movie was to make. Very simple story the lead character can communicate with animals and can see through their eyes he uses this ability to avenge his fathers death against an evil priest and a hoard of barbarians. Throw in a beautiful girl a few witches and a couple of allies and you have a real winner. The thing to remember here is that most mega budget movies cost at least 25 million US then and this well it didn't director commentary mentions about 4 million US This movie is still regarded as an absolute classic and I was raised on this film. HBO became known as Hey Beastmasters On it showed this so often. So if you like sword and sorcery and beautiful heroines and etc etc. You'll love this movie.Enjoy".

There are kings  queens even though the land seems lawless and their power to rule the land is very limited as the evil sorcerers power is way bigger. There are witches magic demons and there is even a young boy that needs to find its place in the world by fulfilling his destiny.There is basically nothing in there that Andre Norton wrote except a man that could communicate with animals.Though it sounds like a copy or a bad ripoff and one of the worst noveltobook conversion Coscarelli would later redeem himself with BubbaHotep the movie is actually very good and highly entertaining. The acting is pretty good even though the actors may not have been the most known ones at that time. Granted the plot is not always the most complicated one around. But hey it's sword and sorcerers!

The basic story is that there is a child that is born and he has the mark of the one that will bring down the evil king that has over turned a kingdom the evil king has his witches go to kill the baby but before they can do it a man comes along and kills the witch and he takes the baby as his own almost. He raises him and trains him and gets a peak at why they call him the Beastmaster he has special powers so he can communicate with them. Fast forward a few years and the Beastmaster is a young man and his whole community gets massacred by the evil kings army. Beastmaster survives and goes on a vigilante spree to fight and regain his kingdom with the help of some friends 2 staph fighter a slave girl love interest 2 ferrets a hawk and a tiger thats basically the story. It had some exciting scenes and it was Never boring thats what was so good about it. This was also made at the same time as the launch of Arnold in conan the barbarian and people seem to remember that movie a lot better than the Beastmaster i guess it had that X factor. I recommend this to almost anyone it was very entertaining and never boring with a good story to it as well. 2 thumbs up.".

	schema:headline " 1980s Fantasy Romp that still entertains";
	schema:reviewBody "I have a massive soft spot for this movie. Unlike a lot of people I actually saw the original UK Theatrical release in glorious 35mm and seeing movies like this on the big screen during a period that gave birth to my love of cinema it remains one of my favorite from my childhood.In a time when film studios were going mad for Star Wars rip offs The Beastmaster was a welcome and overlooked gem amongst a pile of old stones. A very young Marc Singer who would go on to international fame in the series V and Dynasty stars in the title role and I feel carries if off successfully. The Addition of Rip Torn as mega bad guy Mayax brings gravitas to the antagonist in this.The movie is darker in tone than most others of the era and the fact that Don Coscarelli of Phantasm fame was involved in this is no surprise. Here his work is far more polished and well produced than the classic of 70s horror and technically the movie is a smrgsbord of up to date filmmaking for the period. 35mm film some nifty special effects and more dead things than you can shake a stick at.The only other movie of this era like this was Conan the Barbarian which already had a bigger budget and star attraction of the rising legend that is Arnold Swartzenegger but in direct comparison Beastmaster still manages to entertain far more than Conan could manage mostly down to the fact that its editing is competent and never dwells on one situation for too long. Add to that the brilliant soundtrack and you have a movie that does everything it sets out to do in a neat 2 hour package. it may seem like B movie fodder to todays audiences but its still worth a watch in my estimation mainly due to the fact that it still stands up as one of the best fantasy movies of the time. If I had to complain about anything it would be the lack of information and background on the world that this film inhabits as well as the almost silent first 30 minutes that depends more on visual queues and ambiance than dialog. Some of the sword work in this in woefully inadequate to today's standards but for the time it was impressive especially to a 12 year old me. Its upsetting to discover that the Tiger who player Ruuh died 2 years later following skin problems brought on by the black dye used in this movie. It still remains one of my favorite childhood memories and unlike the American audience that had constant reruns on cable TV we have had to rely on VHS and TV showings of this movie in the UK. Definitely worth watching and reliving memories of the 1980s".

	schema:reviewBody "I used to have this movie on a video cassette about 20 years ago when I was around 78 years old. I remember watching it several times when I was little. I guess I was fascinated by the humananimal bond that existed between the Beastmaster and his animal friends or maybe by the dark age placement of the action  the time of mysticism and sacrifice as the movie trailer says  with all its magic sorcery witches... Anyway I remember liking this movie a lot and it being one of my favorites.Little by little cable  satellite TV replaced my old VCR which ended being put in its box Idon'tknowwhere. The cassettes also.It is not long ago when I started talking to a friend of mine about old VCRs and old movies and stuff like this when suddenly I remembered I used to have a favorite movie. Unfortunately I couldn't remember its name... I remembered only very few things  mainly the appearance of some masked men from over a hill a pyramid with a lot of stairs and a fire on its top where people were sacrificed and also a tunnel with traps. ...Nothing about the plot not even the existence of the humananimal bond... nothing else.I had this only thing in my head to find this movie! I took the VCR out of its box connected it to the computer and watching every single video cassette I could find... unfortunately I couldn't find my movie. I started reading plot summaries on IMDb I started watching movie trailers... hundreds of titles sorting them eliminating those that did not match my memories adding others that might be it... After a very long time I ended up with a list of about 15 movies. And The Beastmaster was the one that matched best everything. I can't describe to you the happiness when realizing that THIS was the movie! While watching it... everything came back to my memory the 3 witches the people working the fields near the village the appearance of the Junes from over the hill the eyedring the temple tunnel with those monsterarms coming out the colored eyes of those monsters the children sacrifices the fight on the temple's stairs... everything.To conclude... I can say that The Beastmaster is a great excellent magnificent marvelous fascinating superb extraordinary movie... Even nowadays I can say that this is one of my favorite movies. I enjoyed watching it the same way as when I was little. The plot is great the adventures of the hero are fantastic... When watching it I feel like I'm living during those ages... Everything is so... I don't know... realistic mysterious.Ahh... one more thing. I love to play computer games where the action takes place in the woods in temples in places where you can always expect a monster or an enemy to appear... And I think now I have the explanation why I like this kind of games D C. S.".

But a villager saves the boy and raises him as his own. The boy is named Dar and grows into Marc Singer with the ability to communicate with animals. When Dar's village is raided and all of the villagers killed he sets out to get revenge on the one responsible  Maax. Along the way he is joined by John Amos sexy Tanya Roberts and some furry friends.As with most sword  sorcery movies from the '80s this bears more than a few similarities to Conan the Barbarian. Obviously it's not as good but the inspiration is clearly there. Beastmaster is very cheesy and hard to take seriously. I mean at the end of the day guy who talks to ferrets is a difficult concept to make work as anything other than a punchline. It's also overlong and full of poorly choreographed action scenes. For his part Marc Singer does fine and knows when to play it tongueincheek and when not to. Rip Torn is a total ham as the villain. Tanya Roberts actually takes her role seriously which is embarrassing for her but fun for us. She looks great of course.So yeah it's cheesy and laughable but it's also entertaining. You can shut your mind off and enjoy it as a simple fantasy adventure flick or you can spend a couple of hours poking fun at it. One question I had while watching is why did Dar never try to talk to the horses of the bad guys and make them stop? In the village raid scene and the climax the bad guys are all on horses and yet the guy who communicates with animals makes no effort to use that to his advantage. Anyway it's a good way to pass the time. Followed by two terrible sequels and a forgettable TV series.".

Along the way he gets in contact with some resourceful animals a slave girl Kiri and the captive king's righthand man Seth.Director Don Coscarelli's cult bgrade sword and sorcery epic well it's close enough to one The Beastmaster is an enjoyably mystical adventure which knows it's all a bit of fun. There's no doubting how silly and cheesy it just happens to be but gladly this item is not overly put off by it. There's a real kidlike mentality to it but it breathes an sincereness that sweeps you along for the journey. Coming out the same time as Conan the Barbarian  it was hard no to compare the two. While Conan is obviously the better made grandeur production it kind of had a pretentious feel to it and pacing was incredibly sluggish. Beastmaster might be systematic in the story but to me it was far more entertaining. I might not win any votes for what I have just typed but I'll stick to it.Coscarelli who cowrote the story with Paul Pepperman takes the central idea of our hero communicating with animals from Andre Norton's novel of the same name. The campy plot is routine there's no real twists or surprises with a constant mixture of subplots and ideas involving different adventures which were mostly about rescuing someone or thing which all lead onto the main story of Dar getting revenge. Some might be worthless and too straightforward with relax pacing but I never found a boring moment within them. The direction by Coscarelli has a muscular touch to it and imagination to spare in some creative stabs and visuals. He knows how to create a rich atmosphere and his at his top when his going for that dark edge. The way he staged some of the oneonone combat scenes though came across as too clean and choreographed especially the final climax. The larger battle scenes were gritty kinetic and relentlessly staged though. Also don't expect much in the way of blood from this mainstream aimed piece.Since the budget was reasonably modest it did give the film a slick technical advantage but it definitely tried to outdo itself with the budget it had. The camerawork by John Alcott is beautifully sprawling and nippy. Same treatment for Lee Holdridge's grandly bravura sounding musical score that only heightens the atmosphere locations and actions. Sound effects were effectively cutting and location sets were cleverly shaped. Only drawcard in this would be that editing at times came across as very ragged. Reading that the film was far shorter in the first cut the producers then got the editors to extend certain scenes and Coscarelli and Pepperman had no say in it. That's disappointing because it would have been better off with the first cut and maybe gained more respect. The acting is nothing sensational but acceptably good. Marc Singer wasn't too bad and felt right at home in the part of Dar. Tanya Roberts looks drop dead gorgeous but isn't called on to do too much. Chewing it up as the villain is Rip Torn as he fabulously turns it up with plenty of flavour and John Amos is acceptably solid as Seth. Then you got the welltrained animals that impress and charm when on screen.The Beastmaster is extremely goofy but at the same time this humorous corker makes for great comicstyle entertainment. There's nothing spectacular to it but this cult fantasy flick which gained popularity on cable TV is one of the better genre efforts.".

Marc Singer wasn't too bad and felt right at home in the part of Dar. Tanya Roberts looks drop dead gorgeous but isn't called on to do too much. Chewing it up as the villain is Rip Torn as he fabulously turns it up with plenty of flavour and John Amos is acceptably solid as Seth. Then you got the welltrained animals that impress and charm when on screen.The Beastmaster is extremely goofy but at the same time this humorous corker makes for great comicstyle entertainment. There's nothing spectacular to it but this cult fantasy flick which gained popularity on cable TV is one of the better genre efforts.";

The movie is a Conanwannabe swordsandsorcery pic.

Marc Singer is great as our hero Dar The Beastmaster. Singer went out of his way to be in amazing shape and is totally ripped. What he lacked in acting ability he makes up for with athletic prowess charisma and one sick mullet! In addition to being a powerful warrior he has the skill to befriend animals. The animals help him on his quest to liberate the kingdom from evil priest Maax and repel The Jun Horde. Maax is a great villain played by the legendary Rip Torn. Tanya Roberts is slave girl Keirie love interest for Dar and eye candy for the male hetro audience. John Amos best known as Cleo McDowell in Coming To America is strong support and gives a great performance. The film looks great and was shot by Academy Award winner John Alcott. Alcott won the Academy Award for best cinematography on Stanley Kubrick's classic Barry Lyndon. The FX look good as well and there is a lot of great action as well. Unlike many similar genre films that came out during the same period The Beastmaster is a bloodless movie and is family friendly without being corny. That feat was one many movies can't manage especially the sequel to Conan Conan The Destroyer. The Beastmaster took in little money at the box office when it was released. However it blew up when it came out on cable and home video. Since then it has found its audience and is a cult classic that holds up well. The sequels to the best of my memory are real bad and do not involve writerdirector Don Coscarelli. Had he been involved the sequels would have been better.

A modern retelling goodlooking leads gorgeous cinematography and Neil Patrick Harris? Perfect ingredient for a good old romance movie I'd say.But I was wrong. The movie even started on the wrong foot with Alex Pettyfer's dismal acting. Maybe he's been doing so many action movies that putting on the skin of a romantic lead was a little hard. His portrayal of the vain selfish and mean lead was unconvincing at best. Now the best part of Beast's transformation was the comingofage of the spoiled 'prince' into a ragefilled beast and finally into a selfless man transformed by love. None of that were evident in Kyle Kingson. He was a brat then a whiny stalker and finally an emo dude.Vanessa Hudgens also gave a cringeworthy performance. She was so flat and void of personality that it was painful to watch. Beside the bad acting the plot was also a little draggy lacking in climax and real emotion. You don't feel drawn to the characters you don't feel convinced by the emotions and you will cringe at the incredibly cheesy lines. In fact my sister and I kept mumbling 'Don't say it! Don't say it! throughout the movie because a clichd oneliner is always around the corner.The one saving grace was Neil Patrick Harris but that's only because he brought his 'Barney Stinson' persona into the movie. Though I absolutely adore Barney it would be nice to see NPH bring something different to the plate. All in all I'd say watch this movie if you're looking for style but don't go looking for substance. There's not much to be had.".

Vanessa Hudgens is not a beautiful actress and is very weak for the lead role. Further she does not show any chemistry with Alex Pettyfer. The plot is weird and the way that Lindy is forced to move to the Hunter's apartment through blackmail of her father does not convince. The plot has many flaws but Beastly is neither the best nor the worst romance recently released and there are many unfair reviews in IMDb. Despite the flaws this film actually entertains on DVD. My vote is five.Title Brazil A Fera The Beast".

He invites her to a party and humiliates her in front of their classmates. However Kendra curses him with a spell that makes Kyle as ugly as his soul. Further she tells that if he does not find anyone who loves him within a year he will be doomed to that appearance forever. When Kyle's father Rob Kingson Peter Krause sees him he takes Kyle to specialists but the doctors do not know what to do. So Rob hides Kyle in an apartment with a maid and a blind tutor. When Kyle sees his mate Lindy Vanessa Hudgens on the streets he saves her from a dangerous drug dealer and he brings her to his apartment to protect her. Now his only hope is that Lindy falls in love with him.Beastly is a contemporary teenversion of The Beauty and the Beast. The ridiculous makeup on Alex Pettyfer is the weakest part of the film. Vanessa Hudgens is not a beautiful actress and is very weak for the lead role. Further she does not show any chemistry with Alex Pettyfer. The plot is weird and the way that Lindy is forced to move to the Hunter's apartment through blackmail of her father does not convince. The plot has many flaws but Beastly is neither the best nor the worst romance recently released and there are many unfair reviews in IMDb. Despite the flaws this film actually entertains on DVD. My vote is five.Title Brazil A Fera The Beast";

But the story didn't convince me how the beast and the beauty fall in love. To me it just seems to be written in such way Kyle and Lindy are just performing their roles as written in the screenplay with not much emotions involved in acting. I don't see Kyle getting much upset turning from such flawless face as he thought to a seriously scarfaced and Lindy not being surprised when she saw Kyle's face  as Hunter a total stranger  this just doesn't quite make sense. I think the acting plays an important role in terms of touching audience's emotions and connection to the movie but the casts in Beastly fail in such area. The leading casts maybe good with simple teen love story but the storyline in Beastly seems to be a heavy topic for them to handle so now it just appears to be a shallow love movie with no sentiments triggered.".

Disney's Beauty and the Beast was far more interesting and much more entertaining than this version.

	schema:reviewBody "The novel Beastly by Alex Flinn is phenomenal. The movie version of Flinn's modern Beauty and the Beast tale Beastly is just that a modern Beauty and the Beast that draws very loosely on Flinn's novel. Let's begin with Alex Pettyfer as Kyle Superb. In the movie he may be Kyle Kingson instead of Kyle Kingsbury he may do different things for Lindy's love but the essence of Kyle is the same entirely to Alex's credit. Alex read the novel in preparation for the role. His performance as Kyle redeems this film for all its changes. NPH and the actress who plays Zola Magda are also wonderful the regrettable thing about them is that isn't more scenes with the three of them in the movie. Mary Kate Olsen was surprisingly spoton as Kendra Kudos to MK for that! Vanessa I saved her for last. I'm not the HSM type but I went into the movie giving her the benefit of the doubt. She was not bad she did not ruin the movie not that it would have been possible for her to do so given Alex's loaded with heart performance. The flirty cutesy scenes between her and ALex were quite sweet but when it came to the scenes where she should have dug deeper like when her father overdoses or when she is about to leave for Macchu Picchu the girl just is detached flatshe doesn't bring the emotion.Now for the changes between the novel and the movie. The name changes are minor and I didn't mind them so much except for Kyle's Beast name being Hunter instead of Adrian that bugs me because there is a reason why he chose the name Adrian. A change I did enjoy was the choice of makeup for the Beast. In the book he is a fabulous furry beast which I love but I found the make up in the movie rich fascinating and unique! In the movie. there is more interaction between Kyle and Lindy preTransformation which works for the movie. Lindy comes to live with Kyle through different means which I have certain issues with 1. Her father is all torn up about sending her to Kyle. Lindy's Dad is a jerk in the book and that's part of the great grit of the novel he has no qualms about trading his daughter for his own safety I wish they would have kept that grit in the movie. 2. They set it up like Lindy will be in danger from her Dad's dealer but they don't follow through. In the book it is the dealer that comes after her why they don't follow through with this perplexes me. 3. Lindy has contact with the outside world in the movie Hunter builds the greenhouse for her but he does not make her room. In the novel he builds the green house for himself as he learns to appreciate simpler beauty that's part of the character's arc why change it? She is supposed to be isolated like him and making her room shows how much he cares again character arc. Iconic elements from the book are missing snowball fight dancing subway Halloween mirror KendraMadga twist at the end and Will doesn't really tutor him which totally contradicts the book. But all the changes are things that I could accept. Kyle is still cursed still falls in love with a girl named Lindy and still learns his lesson. However movie Lindy is not book Lindy at all. Book Lindy sweet doeeyed and dreamy. In the movie she is stronger and more confident. I'm all about strong independent heroines but book Lindy was also admirable. There is one thing that I can't forgive and that truly disappoints me the ending. At the end she simply says I love you and he changes back and voilkiss in the middle of the streetThe End. WHAT??!! The end in the book is heartwrenching beautiful and poignant. It's a 'I can't read fast enough oh God what's going to happen tears welling up epic' ending. Adrian Kyle is wounded rescuing Lindy and the beast dies only to be transformed and revived in a beautiful swirl of white roses back to life and back to Kyle. The ending in the movie is anticlimatic even for the movie which as a whole is softer and lighter than the book. So should you go see? Yes go see it. Alex Pettyfer is too wonderful to miss. But if you have read the book go into the movie knowing that it is not Flinn's novel brought to life on the silver screen. If you have not read the book yet see the movie firstI think you'll enjoy it more that way. I've seen it twice. I enjoyed the second viewing more because I went into it accepting it for it is loosely based on the novel. Alex is even better the second time. The end is still anticlimatic but it's a sweet Beauty and the Beast story.".

I thought this movie was going to be good but to my disappointing it really wasn't it was to some extent like beauty and the beat other then the fact there was no real look into the story. It was very quickly moving on so that you couldn't really get into the movie which was a shame really for a movie that looked so good but I guess you can judge a film by its trailer. The acting was OK but was very serious and not that romantic. I wouldn't really suggest going to see it unless you want to see a romantic film with no action or real story to it. The only real good bit is learning how real the dad only likes his son  Alex when he's handsome and will do anything to get him beautiful again which made feel quite sad that's how the dad see's him.The beast really didn't look much like a beast almost like some one with lots of tattoos also he still had a six pack so it made him look even less ugly.So I wouldn't see this movie unless you in there with a child or want to watch some boring romantic film.".

	schema:headline " May disappoint readers of the book but not a bad movie";
	schema:reviewBody "If you've read the book Beastly you're probably pretty psyched about the new movie adaptation that just came out. For those of you who haven't read it it's basically a modern version of Beauty and the Beast about a selfish teenage boy named Kyle who cares only about his looks and after blowing off his date to the dance a witch named Kendra gets transformed by Kendra into a hideous beast and is forced to live isolated from the world with only his humorous blind teacher and loving housekeeper for company. The catch to the spell is that Kyle can have his looks back if he can get a girl to fall in love with him and see him for who he truly is within a year. Kyle thinks this task impossible but then fate steps in and leads him to Lindy a somewhat awkward but very intelligent girl. Well this movie is one of many that did not stay true to the book very well but was still enjoyable for anyone who didn't mind the tweaks or hadn't read the book at all. They didn't butcher it in a bad way is what I'm trying to say.First of all many of the names were changed and I don't understand why. It's not as if they needed to change the names it seems like it may have been something the directors just did for fun. Another small concern I had was Vanessa Hudgens and it's not about her acting. She was way too gorgeous! Whoever did her hair makeup and wardrobe you hit the nail on the head with the beauty factor. I think this is the prettiest I've seen her look to be honest. And unfortunately that's just didn't fit with how I pictured Lindy. Vanessa's still gorgeous and I'm definitely not fuming with anger about it but in an interview Hudgens said Lindy's kind of the girl that no one notices. Umm not with the way you were looking in that movie! I found it very unrealistic that someone that gorgeous would have the life and social skills of someone like Lindy. I think the directors were trying to stay true to the original Disney's Beauty and the Beast being that Belle was known for her looks but odd and independent personality. They may have also done this to emphasize even more how ugly Kyle was! Kyle also was not a furry beast like the Disney movie as it describes in the book. That I can completely understand. That would just be way too much makeup work and too much of their time. What killed me the most about this movie was the ending. It was very rushed and was so abrupt. After reading the book I had much higher expectations. Overall this is a typical chickflick that is enjoyable and pretty entertaining for those who haven't read the book but may be a bit angering to those who have because of all the changes that were made. Therefore if you're not dying to see it or are getting this vibe that you might hate it just wait until the DVD comes out and rent it. It's a better book than a movie but still great for just watching for pleasure or with friends. Read the book before or after you watch it and see what you think!".

In time they will begin to realise that beneath your abusive threatening and uglyincertainlights exterior lies a kind gentle creature. A creature who likes to feed birdies reveal libraries and much moreleave it.Beastly is based on the fairy tale of the beautiful girl who falls in love with a monster and breaks a curse meaning instead of a minging hairy beast she gets to live forever in a palace with a hottie who's rich. Beauty is a lucky cow. The modern message should be love them now while their gruesome looking later a bit of plastic surgery and a makeover and you'll get your fairytale. Just look at Colleen Rooney she stuck around and she has a millionaire footballer who's reallygood looking. Better example as someone said on Youtube the future nerds and fatties of today billionaires and hotties of tomorrow.Beauty and the Beast is all about looking past the outward appearance of someone and discovering their personality and desiring them because of who they are. It is interesting to get the story from the BeastKyle's perspective of losing your adorable good looks for tattoosand scars because those aren't attractive at all! In this superficial world we live in it's easy to see why this loss grieved him. Read FaceBenjamin Zephaniah There's a scary moment when you're a kid and you realise you preferred Beast to Adam. Why is that? I imagine that it's because you get to know him as a character and see Belle's love for him grow. Through her eyes we see that he is beautiful and that Adam iswell we all remember the revelation.I did feel that in the beginning the script was a little too clunky and didn't fit. Oddly enough Vanessa Hudgens managed not to ruin the film by beingVanessa Hudgens. Of course Alex Pettyfer stole the show with his everything. You want to believe that he is meant to be ugly but he just isn't. Mary Kate Olsen as KendraWitch was also amazing I wanted to see more of her. Hollywood just freaks me out with its weird 'be yourself but only if you're hot' message. In the film Kyle isn't ugly he's just different which must be frowned upon! You could tell they wanted to take him all the way into emodom but there would have been an uproar especially from meabout what they were trying to portray. I won't spoil the ending but I think you can guess what happens. What would an emo Alex Pettyfer look like?The sad thing is that Vannessa Hudgens and Kristen Stewartqueens of the frozen facewill still get acting roles. Although I guess my face would be frozen if I was working with The Lautner and Alex yes we are on first name terms. So should you watch this film? There is a hot guy in it it's summer do you want to overheat? It is very sweet in parts thoughsighTagline Love is never ugly....unless you're an ugly girl".

Usually I ignore all the clips and promos so they don't ruin the film for me but I was so excited I couldn't keep from watching them. Thus I had great expectations for the film. Expectations that sadly were not met.First Alex is enjoyable as Kyle. Probably not the best but there are many scenes that I truly enjoy his character. Little mannerisms such as his excited giggle or concerned look or his phone call to his dad excellet. There is the issue of what he looks like as the beast though. Many fans are upset that he isn't ugly. I guess that's true but I don't mind so much. I did enjoy the scars and tattoos they were a stark contrast to non beastly Kyle so I don't join the ranks of those who hated his look. Plus isn't his beastly personality supposed to be the worst part? Second Vanessa Hudgens as Lindy. I like Vanessa and I know from promos that she was working on new tones of voice and different skills for this film. But it kind of came across as flat. Not terrible but...almost too monotone. I wasn't sure who Lindy was supposed to be. She had a lot of different airs about her. Happy go lucky stand offish in love in disgust. Maybe that's just how real women are confusing.  Third Neil Patrick Harris and the housekeeper. One word for both of them Excellent.Finally the plot. Here we go. I can suspend belief and believe in the magical curse easy enough. But...SPOILER..kinda...Let her live with me or I'll turn you in to the police Say what? It is almost too much to believe. END of SPOILER Another hard part for me was that there was NO ACTION!! There was a tad in the middle with the druggies but that was it my friends. Even at the end there was no climatic moment. It just kinda hit a nice stride and stayed there and ended there. I thought I learned in 7th grade there should be a build up to a climax and then a small anti climax. None in this film. None. It's not a surprising end just a flat one.I truly did enjoy the film but felt when I left the theater I was going to go back and watch the rest after dinner. Like it didn't quite end. Will I watch it again? Sure I really like Alex and Vanessa is good but I'll just remember when I watch it again that my expectations should be lowered.".

Seeing as they changed the release date the movie did not meet my expectations. For those of you who didn't read the book take my word for it that many aspects were unnecessarily changed in the movie. For instance their NAMES. In the book his name is Kyle Kingsbury but they changed it to Kingson in the movie. Also his name becomes Adrian in the book. Yet they call him Hunter in the movie instead. Why? I don't know. Such a change may seem insignificant. But if it matters so little why bother CHANGING it?? Plus as much as I love Neil Patrick Harris Will was much different in the book but I won't complain because NPH provided some much needed comedic relief. And many other parts of the plot line were changed like why Vanessa Hudgens' character was in the house with Adrian  I'm sorry HUNTER  in the first place. Also they changed the ENTIRE ending  even though the ending in the book was better.So overall the book was more suspenseful. If you like relatively pointless but somewhat charming love stories you'll like it. But if you read the book I suggest you wait to rent the DVD.".

If you like relatively pointless but somewhat charming love stories you'll like it. But if you read the book I suggest you wait to rent the DVD.";

My favourite character was Neil Patrick Harris Will the blind tutor.... he made me laugh at almost all the scenes he was in.I did enjoy some of the characters and Vanessa was very convincing as Lindy and played her part well. I enjoyed MaryKate's character as Kendra. It was fun seeing her in a different acting role then the many years of having watched her on Full House and all those cute Olson Twin movies. So all in all I enjoyed my evening out with my girls. Please keep in mind that we did not know this movie was based on a book which is probably why my girls enjoyed it so much.".

	schema:reviewBody "First of all I just want to say that I am not the biggest fan of Vanessa Hudgens. However her playing opposite Alex Pettyfer and the chemistry that he added really helped her in this movie. I gotta say it....there is something about Alex Pettyfer on screen that keeps you captivated. He does it in I Am Number Four and again here in Beastly. People keep comparing him to Robert Pattinson but I see their career paths going in different directions Pattinson's next project is w David Cronenberg and I see Pettyfer going more mainstream. While I have never read Beastly I think this was a much better young adult film adaption than the Twilight Saga films. There was bunch of males in our group that attended the sneak preview of Beastly. After Twilight they had low expectations of this film and they enjoyed this film far more. Brilliant casting move by making Neil Patrick Harris the tutor of Alex Pettyfer. As always Harris's comedic timing was impeccable. Who knows if his lines where improvised or what but whatever came out of his mouth was hilarious. I had low expectations of MaryKate Olsen's role going into this but she definitely owned her role as the witch. I thought whoever did the costuming for her character did a fantastic job too. Loved how each ensemble she wore was different but yet at the same time very interesting. I thought the set design and music choices were all well done. I thought the makeup on Alex Pettyfer when he was the beast was superb. His makeup was the perfect blend of creativity but still have a gruesome quality to it. And of course the message about not judging a book by it's cover is always valid even in this modern remake of the original tale by GabrielleSuzanne Barbot de Villeneuve. Look I had low expectations of this movie but after viewing it I thought it was a very fun date night kind of flick even for the older sect. Just saying don't completely write it off because of Twilight or Hudgen's high school musical past.....".

First and foremost this is the kind of script you don't really see much of anymore especially in teenage romcoms. It is as much a stage play as a movie script. Percentagewise the number of scenes with the same two characters BY THEMSELVES running lines off each other Pettyfer and Hudgens is very high. And therein lies the good news and the bad news. The good news is that DirectorWriter Daniel Barnes took risks the kind of risks you can only take when you are in point of fact both the director and writer on the production. He placed all his trust in his actors and gave them lots of room. The bad news is that it doesn't always work. I am not sure where the fault lies  since with issues of chemistry you need something to compare to  but if I had to guess I would point the finger at Hudgens. This film was done at the end the very unusual arc in her career when as far as teen movies went she was the it girl she was the girl every high school guy would sell his parents to gypsies for. Whether or not she can deliver this promise is another matter. She is cute she is sweet she is vulnerable. But that's fine for love at a distance. Love in tight closeups with tricky dialog is another matter entirely. If you want to see a quirky Disney romcom done to sizzling perfection look at THE CUTTING EDGE also in my reviews where the characters completely sell the romance from the first scene to the delight of the audience.

	schema:reviewBody "As an avid supporter of fairy tales a particular favourite being Beauty and the Beast I went to see this film despite its horrendous critical reception. I usually enjoy mindless simple teen trash for what it is and was even somewhat intrigued by the film's trailer. Unfortunately calling Beastly teen trash would be a generous understatement.The film's screenplay is no better than the work of a high school student trying to write a short story during their creative writing class. There is rarely if any witty dialogue and many of the lines are laughoutloud funny in their obscurity and cheesiness. There are a few very simple plot points in the film and the rest is just utter nonsense and one overly long and painfully uninteresting montage after another. The film should have spent more time developing characters and less time on these useless montage sequences that are so painfully tedious that I actually joked with my friend about falling asleep in the theatre several times.The acting is pretty mediocre. I'm not going to call Hudgens or Pettyfer abominations to the craft of acting simply because their characters didn't have nearly enough depth to allow them to prove whether or not they can act. MaryKate Olsen stands out as one of the few redeeming qualities this movie has. Her character is instantly biting and likable she causes you to crave more screen time for her character throughout the film with her adorably wicked smirk and eerie vibe. Neil Patrick Harris is underused in what could have been a potentially interesting side character but manages to try and salvage his poorly written material.Basically this movie feels longer than it is causing many of us to wish it would just be over. Nothing interesting happens that didn't occur in the trailer. There are many unnecessary plot elements such as something that happens with Hudgens' character's father towards the end and then is sort of just solved offscreen with no real explanation. It's a tedious film and the ending is a copout that leaves a bad taste in your mouth as it completely undermines the supposed message of the film. And to top it off they didn't have the decency to even attempt an epic climax. The climax and final embrace of the romantic leads is truly uninspired and pathetic. Just like the majority of this beastly excuse for a film.".

Not a movie you devote 100 of your attention to but definitely interesting background fodder.Parts I liked The plot was interesting albeit common a good looking guy who sucks at life turns ugly and has to change his internal persona to become good looking again. The girl who played opposite the Rich Schmuck turned beast was pretty good. She was for the most part likable there were issues I had with her which I will address later but she's the kind of girl you'd hope to land in real life...for the most part. The ending was sweet and made me borderline cry weird I know. The ending where you realize the Rich Schmuck's dad is going to get screwed just like his son did....pretty cool.Parts I didn't like The movie is so incredibly short like an hour and 20 minutes that none of the relationships are developed not even a little bit. The reason the movie gives to get this girl to move into the rich schmuck's house is kinda bizarrei.e. he breaks up a fight the girl's dad then turns a gun on the bad guy and kills him so in exchange for the rich schmuck not turning this guy in he blackmails the dad to give him ownership of his daughter I mean it's completely bizarre. I didn't like that this girl who falls for the beast already liked this guy before he became the beast. This guy is a total loser douche bag before turning into the beast giving speeches about how he's awesome and rich and how everyone who's ugly sucks humiliating women in public etc. I mean there is not a single redeemable characteristic of this kid so it really undermines this girl's character that she LIKES THIS DOUCHE.Lastly that they have to rely on weird tribal looking tattoos and tree tattoos and metal rivets in his face to make him ugly is stupid. A lot of those tattoos were pretty bad ass and would not be a turn off. The face tattoos were gross but the body ones were kinda cool. There should have been a better effort to make this guy ugly instead of relying on tattoos and piercing the costume designer needs a reality check.Overall it's a C decent story cute girl some nice romance that is hurt by it's bad costumes douchey lead bizarre story twists and lack of character development.".

Kyle was moved into a place of his own after doctors told his father that um no a face transplant is not a viable option. We are all familiar with the tale of Beauty and the Beast so we all know where the characters are headed and what happens at the end. This isn't the kind of film for special effects or overchoreographed fight scenes so that leaves the acting. Both Alex Pettyfer and Vanessa Hudgens are easy on the eyes but their acting skills have yet to be fully developed or developed at all. It seems like Pettyfer is trying but Hudgens has one or two facial expressions in her repertoire. I've seen better acting from my daughter's sock puppets. The saving grace is Neil Patrick Harris whose comedic timing is sublime. He breathes some life into this flat fantasy. Parents this is okay to let your tweenteen watch but I don't recommend it.".

We are all familiar with the tale of Beauty and the Beast so we all know where the characters are headed and what happens at the end. This isn't the kind of film for special effects or overchoreographed fight scenes so that leaves the acting. Both Alex Pettyfer and Vanessa Hudgens are easy on the eyes but their acting skills have yet to be fully developed or developed at all. It seems like Pettyfer is trying but Hudgens has one or two facial expressions in her repertoire. I've seen better acting from my daughter's sock puppets. The saving grace is Neil Patrick Harris whose comedic timing is sublime. He breathes some life into this flat fantasy. Parents this is okay to let your tweenteen watch but I don't recommend it.";
