Though it doesn't have much of a following the movies does have some redeeming qualities that make it worth a rental.The plot follows 3 young men Marky Buffy and Kool through getting fired from a low rate Nursing home. Lucky for them or so they think Winslow Lowry is right there to offer them a new job caring for his Uncle Albert.What the boys don't know is that Winslow actually wants his Uncle to die so that he can inherit Albert's huge fortune. On top of that Mr. Winslow is in debt to Mr. Montana a ruthless criminal mastermind. If Winslow doesn't get the money within 3 weeks he's dead.Winslow's plan quickly backfires as he finds out that his new Orderlies have actually helped Albert feel young again.The movie itself is hilarious. It follows the tradition of the Three Stooges. The constant slap fights and kicks in the backside between the fat boys will keep you stomach in pain from laughter. Ralph Bellamy is great in his role as Albert Dennison. He keeps the movie fresh and alive. While Anthony Geary plays a perfect seedy bad guy.The Soundtrack is also great. The Fat Boys have some pretty catchy tunes throughout the movie including a hilarious performance for the camera.Give it a Rent while it's not for everyone it may just make you laugh out loud a few times.".

He gives a performance of a lifetime. This is Ralph Bellamy's second role as a millionaire in an 80's film. He earlier appeared in the much inferior Trading Places. That film doesn't even hold a candle to this one.The Fat Boys play orderlies who are put in charge of an elderly millionaire Bellamy. His nephew Geary hires them in the hope that their incompetence kills his uncle and he can inherit the money. What an original storyline!!

Geary is the sort of rotten  conniving  yet also pathetic  antagonist whom the audience will enjoy booing while Rodriguez is just pure thug. Notable character actor Tony Plana rounds out the trio of baddies as the bumbling valet. Gorgeous Troy Byer is an appealing romantic interest for Morales.

I can honestly say that I still really enjoy it. The film is pretty silly and has a lot of slapstick humorthink The Three Stooges if they were overweight black rappers from NYC in the 80's but The Fat Boys are very likable hilarious dudes. The Boys do well in carrying the picture and had real good chemistry with Ralph Bellamy. This is not the best comedy from this time period but is definitely underrated and much funnier than a whole lot of stuff that gets more fanfare. Disorderlies is very much an 80's movie. Some people might call this film cheesy but keep in mind that this is a comedy and this film is a lot of fun. Plus The Fat Boys rock and they provide the soundtrack to this awesome 80's movie. Great stuff for sure and they absolutely do not make them like this anymore.".

You have some over weight young black orderlies who can not only laugh at themselves but make you laugh with every line every nuance and subtle gesture they conjure up in this movie. Ralph Bellamy plays the consummate straight guy and doesn't miss a beat esp. at his age. My 15 year old son watched it once and we split our sides laughing. My son is 30 now and he asked me if I wanted to watch that movie with him again. Yeah I said. We could use more laughs. We could use more young actorcomedians especially ones from our own minority groups here in the good ol' USA. This is a funny movie and its probably more hilarious the second time around.".

	onyx:emotionText "As you may know comedy is the most difficult art form of all. To make people laugh all people young old white Asian or black male and female is truly the finest art form. This movie pulls it off. You have some over weight young black orderlies who can not only laugh at themselves but make you laugh with every line every nuance and subtle gesture they conjure up in this movie. Ralph Bellamy plays the consummate straight guy and doesn't miss a beat esp. at his age. My 15 year old son watched it once and we split our sides laughing. My son is 30 now and he asked me if I wanted to watch that movie with him again. Yeah I said. We could use more laughs. We could use more young actorcomedians especially ones from our own minority groups here in the good ol' USA. This is a funny movie and its probably more hilarious the second time around.";

	schema:reviewBody "In an old school mood I spent a good weekend looking around for some great old school rap music. I was pleased to hear that Prince Markie Dee and Kool Rock were finally getting back together for a Fat Boys reunion album. Buffy the largest of the group died back in 1995 but it is nice for them to carry on the legacy of the group. There was Buffy recorded vocals for a comeback album that was planned during the nineties that never came about  so they those for the upcoming album.ANYWAY I thought of Disorderlies  which I pulled off my friend's DVD shelf to watch. The Fat Boys stole the show in Krush Groove and their lighthearted humor would play out well for a starring feature. They landed Krush Groove director Michael Schultz who had at that time directed some classics like Car Wash and Cooley High not to forget The Last Dragon and Ralph Bellamy  who is usually known as 'one of the old dudes from Trading Places'.The film was actually a very modest hit  making just a little more than 10 million dollars at the box office. RunD.M.C.'s film which came out just a year later would only gross 3.5 million!!! Off the top of my head I went and looked up what Belly made in theaters  the film that starred Nas DMX and Method Man. Over 10 years later that film made just LESS than 10 million dollars. DMX you got PWNED by The Fat Boys Around 1987 was where Schoolly D Public Enemy and IceT were bringing their early gangster rap that would soon be solidified by N.W.A. The Fat Boys would see Disorderlies as one of their higher points as a group. They made a few more albums the last one without Markie as he broke out to do a successfully early 90s solo career. And that would be it for the boys  at least moviewise. Sure this film isn't winning any awards but over twenty years later it is still FUN! Of course others have compared this the humor to The Three Stooges and perhaps owing a bit to The Marx Brothers as well. It's a welcomed comparison but the slapstick plays well with the Fat Boys.So I was happy to rewatch the movie and enjoy the hell out of it. If you've never seen the movie or never even heard of the Fat Boys  it is really a treat to watch for the first time. The trio were amazing rappers and...while not great actors...made the most of a fun film. It almost makes you forgive Michael Schultz for directing Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. ...

For comparison's sake to recent similarly themed Korean movies it's not near on the level of say The Host but it's quite better than incredibly disappointing Sector 7.SPOILERS AHEAD!Here's your story A severely dehydrated and decomposed body washes up on shore somewhere in Korea. The medical examiners are a bit baffled at the cause of death but alert the police that this isn't the first identical case they've seen. Soon enough more dead bodies start arriving by the handful then dozens then hundreds across the whole of Korea. Widespread panic sets in and it quickly becomes clear that some type of deadly outbreak is underway. With few clues at all the authorities fortunately catch a break when they observe some of deaths occurring in real time on video cameras throughout the country. What they see appears to be people desperately trying to drown themselves as if they were possessed or on drugs. Another break in the case soon appears when one of the bodies is recovered before it can make it to a waterway to drown itself. What's inside the body are mutated parasitic worms that have latched on to the human nervous system in order to feed  reproduce.The worms feed on the host requiring massive amounts of water to stay hydrated until they are fully grown. Once in the adult stage they drive the host to the nearest body of water where they can escape in order to reproduce. Surgery is not an option but at least the doctors and scientists can now study the parasites and try to find a way to kill them. They better find a solution quick though because the epidemic is spinning out of control. The pacing of the early half of this movie is really nicely done. The outbreak occurs suddenly and without explanation and the tension is palpable as thousands of people are soon contaminated and efforts to contain the problem are not working. Before long infected people are everywhere and their zombie like insistence to get to water is entertainingly portrayed. This part of the movie certainly gives you a we're all screwed impression that the end of the world is near.Miraculously there already exists a solution for the problem in the form of a rather obscure over the counter drug that was recently discontinued. The general public races out to buy up the remaining supply off the shelves while the government works to restart production as quickly as possible. The lone pharma company that makes the drug can't meet demand alone though and being a dickish pharma company they don't want to release the drug's formula because of the profits at stake. The outbreak the government's efforts in containing it and the pharma company's involvement are all effectively portrayed. There's also some lingering concerns as to how and why this outbreak started and why this otherwise unimportant drug is the cure all. It makes for an interesting case study that covers a wide range of the implications of modern medicine  science corporate power  greed etc.Where this film fails to succeed is on a personal level. While the wider focus is on the overall problem at hand there's also a separate focal point involving 2 brothers and their families affected by the epidemic. These personal stories are attempted to be interjected in similar manner as in The Host to give you a familypersonal connection to the overall monsterdisaster story but it's not very effective. Part of the problem is the actors and actresses don't seem to mesh together well and worse their interpersonal stories are not very well written for them. I simply did not care about the cop and the relationship with his estranged scientist wife because of the cursory nature of it. The other brother's efforts to save his family are undermined by a similar problem.These stories are underwritten and seemed forced into the plot without much foresight. Either they should have devoted more effort developing these characters before and during the events or they should have dedicated less time to them altogether. As it stood it came off as a somewhat halfassed attempt to have you invest in some random characters as they reconnect with one another while under duress. Did not work!Overall this film's not bad for what it is. It works OK enough to slightly recommend and it does so on a moderate budget for a horrormonster film.Bottom Line 6 or 7 stars or so. 6 stars it is.".

	schema:headline " An entertaining pandemic thriller in the Hollywood style";
	schema:reviewBody "Deranged is an ecological thriller from South Korea with a fair amount of action and a few drama elements as well. Fans of movies such as The Host or Tidal Wave will also enjoy this one.The movie tells us the story of two brothers who don't talk to each other anymore since a tragic incident in the past. The intelligent Jae Hyeok is a disgruntled sales executioner in a pharmaceutical company and has to do a few very degrading jobs to make his wife and two children live a modest live. His brother JaePil is a cop with a bad reputation but a few good connections who is in a relationship with a doctor. When a mysterious disease breaks out in the country the wife and children of JaeHyeok are among the one million infected people. The two brothers need to work together and reconcile and soon realize that the catastrophe has something to do with parasites living in water who nest in human bodies and end up killing them by drowning them or breaking out of their stomaches. As investigations progress they realize that the infections didn't break out by pure coincidence and are about to discover a conspiracy. Meanwhile the health of JaeHyeok's wife and children decreases and the two brothers desperately need to get their hands on an obscure and rare medicament that could save them.This pandemic movie convinces with a very solid acting a well done cinematography with a few well done but not overwhelming special effects and an entertaining pace. There really isn't much wrong with the movie but I thought that the little twist in this movie was too generic and predictable as one feels that one has seen this kind of story line a couple of times before in Hollywood. Towards the end the two brothers run a little bit too much around to find the medicament and the concept gets just a little bit repetitive. Apart of that a few more scenes could have been spend on the relationship between the two brother but the movie rather turns out to focus on the sometimes difficult relationship between the father and his wife and children that is very well done and touching.Those who like pandemic thrillers and modern South Korean cinema should purchase this film and will be well entertained. It's nothing groundbreaking or new but the film is on the same high level as the Hollywood movies of the same kind inspired by the novels of Robin Cook Michael Crichton or Stephen King for example.".

The movie starts comically with our protagonist Jaehyk who slaves on behalf of his failing pharmaceutical company and due to his bad choices the future looks bleak. We are introduced to his cute wife and two children for whom he no longer has much time or energy for. The horror aspect begins with people behaving abnormally and some ending up dead and floating in rivers. After that all hell breaks loose and Jaehyk has to start looking out for his family.This movie is very similar to 2011 pandemic movie Contagion but with a lot more gore much of the story dealing with how politicians and scientist deal with the disaster posing a lot of dilemma decisions that has to be made. The other half is dealing with Jaehyk racing against time to save his family. I thought the acting and the chemistry of the family was superb and perhaps the main thing that saves this movie. But the plot seemed to me to be fresh and the pandemic is quite interesting. Unfortunately the movie doesn't seem to have the Hollywood budget and it shows and it looks like a TV movie most of the time. There are not many movies that scare me and this certainly didn't but it was suspenseful with many race against time situations.One thing that I absolutely hated about the movie is that they reveal what the pandemic is before even the half mark after that it is pretty easy to predict why it is happening even though the characters seem oblivious to it.But despite its faults I can see a Hollywood remake happening whether that's in your opinion good or bad. I actually think it would be nice since I think one of the main downfalls of this movie is low budget.Pros Suspenseful interesting pandemic cute main actors interesting difficult dilemma situations deep moments OK social commentary.Cons Too long stupid main plot resolution TV movie like not scary.".

	schema:reviewBody "This isn't the most amazing love story that really really tugs at the heartstrings. But what I liked about it was how it doesn't try to go in a over sappy direction to win the audiences attention. Which a lot of Asian dramas and movies tends to do when it comes to this type of genre. What really stood out to me about this movie is how every dialogue and how the characters communicate amongst each other is very believable. And even can relate with and that is the key word in this movie relate. It's believable for the most pare because you can relate with it well at least for those that had there first crush. Anyways I found this movie to be realistic when it comes to the direction all the way to the end. It doesn't try to go in a fantasy love story but it sometimes gets a bit emotional in a good way. Because at least for me I could see parts of me in this movie when it came to my first crush. The plot is told between two different time periods when the guy starts falling for a classmate at a university and when they are adults later on and the guy is now a architect. And it constantly goes back and forth when it comes to the time period. But it's done in a coherent manner and further develops the plot while keeping certain things untold until it goes into the past or sometimes into the present. Overall I enjoyed this movie the actors and actresses did a good job. Especially Lee JeHoon I don't know about the actress and singer Suzy though because she just doesn't seem all that versatile when it comes to acting. But her character really fit this movie so don't have much complaint on that. This is a movie that some viewers can relate with and if so than your gonna like this movie even more.7.910".

	schema:reviewBody "I have loved Korean films since like forever. Im not a Korean so I rely on English subtitles to watch Korean movies usually this is frustrating since it takes a long time for the subtitles to be available but for this film it took only 3 days! compared to for example Nameless gangster which was released around April but still no subs! This proves how popular architecture 101 must be... and it deserves that attention. Today way too many films are too clich and overexaggerated there are few films which you can see the reflection of yourself in it not even a tiny bit. I am not saying that this film is portraying my life but I think few people can deny that you cant relate with any of the characters. How many people haven't once during the course of their life been Seungmin? Having liked someone that greatly but lacking the courage to say it? How may are just like Seoyeon? Regretting wanting to go back in time and change everything..The actors all did a great job Han Ga In is out of this world pretty and Lee JeHoon seems to be a really promising actor together with Suzy. The reason I did not give the film a 10 is because the ending which to say the least could have been much better and I'm not talking about the outcome but rather the way to end it. However this is still a very very good movie and if you have never seen a Korean film before I advice you to give it a try as it Im sure after watching this movie Korean films will stick by you forever just like me who after that rainy day i decided to give the film Brotherhood of war a go never looked back.".

Architecture 101 will take you through a painful realistic and gutwrenching memoir of growing up next to the childhood love of your life  those best days of your life. However I have just one major gripe that ruined the movie for me.The acting and dialogue are candid the cinematography beautiful and the tragic moments are in the Korean dramatic fashion unapologetically tragic. It is not the type of movie to make you cry outright but it will make you breathe quickly and feel a deep naive longing. The thing that ruined the movie for me is this in one of the scenes a drunk girl is presumably taken advantage of while a boy who is watching not only does nothing to confront the aggressor but leaves the scene and cries about his misfortunes of liking her with one of his friends who consequently calls her worse than a w. Doesn't that make you cringe? It's appalling how this scene isn't rectified if it had been Architecture 101 would be one of my favorite movies. Otherwise it makes me uncomfortable to recommend something that advertises such a cowardly and misogynistic action. So if you feel like there was maybe a little something off about that scene please know that you are not alone.Wouldbe 810 but marked down for the reasons above.And for the wouldbe haters I am a 19 y.o. male not that it makes a difference to my review.610".

If she did have sex she was so wasted she was barely conscious and it could not have possibly been consensual! This movie could have repaired itself after this scene by having the guy when he is older acknowledge his mistake of just standing by while this girl potentially got raped and then mentally criticizing HER for it but no. That whole issue is never mentioned AT ALL.

	schema:reviewBody "The feeling of taking action one moment too late. It is clear from reading other's reviews this is something many people experience. You wait and you worry and you plan and you ponder what might be. Only to find some excuse to back out once you actually built up to courage to follow through.Most Hollywood films would have you believe that if you put yourself out there you'll earn the respect and love of whoever you happen to be pining over mostly from the male perspective. Architecture 101 presents what is the reality for most us we don't know what we're doing.Like a few others I was taken aback by the protagonist's inaction when it came to SeoYeon being drunk. I attributed it to Korea's drinking culture and the dubious nature of Korean university clubs circles. But once I took a step back I realized this fit right in the arc of SeungMin's character. He doesn't like confrontation and will maintain the status quo.Under pressure you don't rise to the occasion you sink to the level of your training. Modern version of a quote by ArchilochusSeungMin doesn't cut off ties with SeoYeon because he feels betrayed it's because he feels he has betrayed her. He knew the kind of person their sunbae was but he didn't do anything to stop the situation from happening. You can see the guilt scarring him deeply. He notices SeoYeon rejecting the advances of the sunbae so she isn't a willing participant but SeungMin still can't bring himself to do anything.The sunbae isn't made out to be some sort of monster because he gets women drunk to get in bed with them. He isn't. He is wrapped up in the culture around him despite knowing what he is doing isn't the most scrupulous. He dodges around the topic and only says enough to sound cool to his underclassmen.I really appreciate the subtlety the director and writers weaved into the story. There are so many details and motifs that could be missed easily. Ex. The seeds SeoYeon planted and kept secret didn't sprout the same as their relationship mementos.".

He doesn't like confrontation and will maintain the status quo.Under pressure you don't rise to the occasion you sink to the level of your training. Modern version of a quote by ArchilochusSeungMin doesn't cut off ties with SeoYeon because he feels betrayed it's because he feels he has betrayed her. He knew the kind of person their sunbae was but he didn't do anything to stop the situation from happening. You can see the guilt scarring him deeply. He notices SeoYeon rejecting the advances of the sunbae so she isn't a willing participant but SeungMin still can't bring himself to do anything.The sunbae isn't made out to be some sort of monster because he gets women drunk to get in bed with them. He isn't. He is wrapped up in the culture around him despite knowing what he is doing isn't the most scrupulous. He dodges around the topic and only says enough to sound cool to his underclassmen.I really appreciate the subtlety the director and writers weaved into the story. There are so many details and motifs that could be missed easily. Ex. The seeds SeoYeon planted and kept secret didn't sprout the same as their relationship mementos.";

Perhaps on one hand this movie depicts that a couple who loved each other on first sight can not be together which is quite near to reality. The life kind of separated and forced them to be apart. The man has to earn more money and pursue his career and the woman has to look after his father. On the other hand this movie is unlike other films. it didn't try to get attention of viewers by having the same old happy ending life.".

For most people the first love is just that. Experiencing your first love can be the most memorable moment of your life. Even a short period of time the innocence and first experiences you share with your first loved one are incomparable with the rest of the relationships in your life. This film perfectly portrays how perfect and bittersweet that first love can be. How when looked on later in life the one mistake that caused that relationship to end is such a small thing. By the time we realize this fact it is too late and we have already moved on with our lives. The sad part of growing up is the realization that the relationships experienced in youth are so much different compared to when we have grown up. Almost cried during this film.

	schema:reviewBody "Many contributors have blamed Seung Min for not helping Seo Yeon when she was drunk with strong possibility that she was subsequently raped. Let us examined the issue.1 Seo Yeon has confessed that she has a crush on Jae Wook . In fact she admitted she took the Architect 101 course because of Jae Wook and she openly flirted with him in his car that she would like to visit his house notwithstanding the poor Seung Min is lying in the back seat. Worst still she openly denied that she is in a relationship with SeungMin in order to be closer to Jae Woo. She does not even has the decency to take into consideration the feeling of Seung MIn. Infact she joined Jae Woo in laughing SeungMin for wearing a fake T Shirt !2 What about Seo Yeon. Is it not her own responsibility to ensure that she does not get herself drunk. If you get yourself drunk then you are very vulnerable and you got yourself to be blamed. Seo Yeon has a drinking bling with Jae Wook whom she has a crush.3 If Seo Yeon is indeed raped by Jae  Wook did she lodge a report with the police for action taken against Jae Wook. If not why ?Looking at all the above maybe Seung Min has taken the right step for not getting himself involved.As to whether Seung Min should rekindle his 1st love with Seo Yeon. The answer is NO as much time has passed. 1 Most importantly Seung Min now have a beautiful fiance who really love and support him and their relationship is soo advance that they are about to get married. If he lose her it will be the biggest mistake of his life 2 Sorry to say Seo Yeon has turned out to be a gold digger and she openly confessed that she is now divorced from her ex husband who is a doctor and she married him for his money 3. Lastly Seo Yeon has never showed any feeling and affection towards Seung Min. Seung Min kissed her and she admitted it is also her first kiss but no response from her. She is so cold blooded. The only time she is excited is when Jae Wook is around. When Seung Min openly declared to her that he is no longer interested in her as he is badly hurt by her sadly Seo Yeon just accepted it with her normal cold blooded self and no efforts on her part to fight to retain Seung Min She must be really stupid to have a crush on Jae Wook who is a well known playboy just because he has a house and a car with devastating consequences. If only she has cherished her 1st love Seung MIn she would have a happy life . Very sad to see Seo Yeon sat ALONE at the window listening to her favourite song with the aeroplane assuming carrying Seung Min and his fiancee to USA flying above her. Yes Seo Yeon has alot of money  Oh I nearly forgotten that she now has a beautiful house but loveless and lonely which is so pitiful. With such a characterit is her destiny to has a lonely life. Lastly with a hindsight even if these 1st love couple managed to over all the obstacles and married in the past not present I doubt their marriage will last as Seo Yeon is very materialistic and Seung Min might not be able to provide the standard of living which Seo Yeon wants.".

Instead it is filled with regret and nostalgia about their immature love in the past. This is why this movie doesn't come home to many foreign people who are not Koreans. Yes this movie's genre is 'Romance'. However you shouldn't watch this expecting a romance and love troubles that you would find in movies such as 'Eternal Sunshine'. If I can write the genre for this movie I would write Korean Romance to demonstrate its uniqueness. If you can understand SeungMin's shyness and immature behaviors that means you share a same thinking that Korean people have. However if you got annoyed by SeungMin's passive acts that means you haven't quite understood Korean people. The moment that SeungMin just runs away when he saw SeoYeon being carried by JaeWook should make you feel pity not anger. In the context of this view this movie is pretty wellmade. It really depicts uniqueness of Korean people very well. When movies fail to depicts Korean uniqueness it becomes nothing but dull and annoying movies. However this movie kept its balance perfectly. Once again if this movie got you annoyed and reminds of you a word 'douchebag' well try more Korean movies and come back later".

	schema:reviewBody "The Day He Arrives is a very interesting look at relationships and the emotional barriers that are put up by both men and women. I'm a big fan of directors who use long takes in scenes and it's really strange here because almost every scene is done in one take even though there's a barrel load of dialogue in each of them  it must have been very hard for the actors but that just brings out the superb performances from each of the cast. Throughout the film we see the same sets and the same supporting characters over and over again  some not related to the plot at all  but unlike most filmmakers the repetition is explained through dialogue and story which makes this quite unique. It's also interesting to take note of the voice over which chimes in every time the main character receives a text message further delving into the main character's mind  something which you don't normally see in any film with any of it's characters. Another great technique used by the director is the zooms  they happen halfway through takes and they never really focus on anything except the characters we rarely get a shot of one character on their own and I don't think there's a single close up in the film. Regardless of that we still feel the characters' emotions as we would in any other film and in that respect the director is doing something very special with these techniques. I look forward to seeing more of the directors work. httpdestroyallcinema.wordpress.com".

	schema:headline " The Day He Arrives  They drink and talk again";
	schema:reviewBody "One thought came to my mind several days after I watched Hong Sangsoo's new movie The Day He Arrives. I am a lot different from his characters but has been my daily life on weekdays monotonously repeated with little variations noticeable enough to help distinguish Monday from Friday like 4 days and 4 nights depicted in the film? I get up in the morning I go to my lab and then after work and some exercise I return to my dormitory at late night for movies and sleep. It sounds boring but small things sometimes happen in my mundane daily life and whether they are good or bad I am not bored much thanks to them.And I was also not bored while watching The Day He Arrives. Like his previous films Hong Sangsoo tells his story in his minimalistic style with his familiar stock characters. Their names are different and the actors playing them are different they are the same kind of men and women we have met from his other 11 works in the past. Again they are associated with the filmmaking and they spend their time with drinking and talking.Seongjun played Yoo JoonSang is a movie director who comes to Seoul for meeting his mentorfriend SangjoongKim Yeongho who works as a movie critic. It is not clear about what he is doing now but it looks like Seongjun is teaching movie in some university instead of making movie. While his movies were not particularly successful considering the conversations between him and others the people he comes across know him and some of them say they like his movies.Day 1 begins with Seongjun trying to reach Sangjoong's cell phone in the afternoon. He does not answer. Seongjun does not know what to do while walking around the streets and alleys of Seoul. He encounters an actress he met before and they have a brief conversation. After that he goes to the bar and drinks some rice wine. Coincidentally there are the film students who recognize him and Seongjun soon joins in their drinking party.Late at night in inebriated state Seongjun suddenly runs away from his bewildered juniors. He goes to the apartment where his former girlfriend lives. She does not welcome him much but soon they have a talk with beer at her small place and Seongjun still drunk keeps telling her he is sorry with pathetic selfpity. It sounds embarrassing but it is funnier than you think and the audiences around me frequently giggled while watching how they eventually share the bed at that night andIn the next morning they behave as if nothing serious had happened during last night. Day 2 begins and Seongjun is wondering around the same area. He meets the same actress and has some conversation with her again. In this time he meets Sangjoong and they go to the bar named Novel together with the film school professor BoramSong Seonmi. They have a long jolly conversation while drinking. Seongjun even plays a piano for them though he is not so good as Sangjoon says.When the owner of Novel appears in front of them Seungjun looks a little confounded by her appearance. She is played by Kim Bogyeong who also plays Seungjun's girlfriend. Are they the same person? No way because there is a scene where one is with Seungjun while the other talks to him through his cell phone. Are they related? Not so possible in my opinion.When Day 3 begins for Seungjun we start to see that Hong Sangsoo is having a fun with the repeated situation for his characters again the drinking begins with another character joining the group. After having some conversation at the campus with warm cups of coffee in their hands Seungjun and Sangjoong meet JoongwonKim Eeseong a former actor who has recently come back from Vietnam where he did some business. Their drinking begins in the early afternoon and again they go to the same bar with Boram. And yes we are not surprised to watch Seungjun play the same piece with the same piano.Are they conscious of their days and nights of alcohol being continuously repeated to some degree? I don't know but I was amused by the actors' droll naturalistic performances. Hong Sangsoo repeats almost the same dialogues at the same places with the same compositions. The characters talk like they have never uttered the same words before. Lots of alcohol must have influenced their memory banks I guess.As a guy who knows several things about the drinking in South Korea I was amused enough to like this pleasant movie. When you drink you may embarrass yourself while talking a lot. You probably try to take care of your problem but with your brain influenced by alcohol you just make yourself more embarrassing. In the end the new day will begin for you  and there is always new night for drinking.".

Many of the events that transpire are repetitive with lots of piano playing drunkenness and visits to various restaurants and bars but there's not really much point to this and zero explanation. There's no discernible beginning middle or end either. It feels like the work of a firsttime director just finding his feet and asking the viewer to endure with him.THE DAY HE ARRIVES contains lots of endless adlibbed scenes with static camerawork. The performances are the only good thing about this the rest of it is a bore. I was thinking this might be some GROUNDHOG DAY time loop style movie but it's far more subtle and obtuse than that and by the time it finishes the only thing you can do is scratch your head and move on to the next movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "The fine line between art and nonsense has been crossed in this movie. In terms of script it is on the level of an average TV drama.

	schema:reviewBody "I read in Sight  Sound recently that Hong movies are received by Korean audiences with gales of laughter. This was my third Hong film and I finally got into that spirit. Luckily a young lady seated near me was on the same wavelength and we started a minor chain reaction although I was laughing alone at the more extreme points of dark humour. Previously I've felt a kind of wave of depression watching the extreme banality of the South Korean lives Hong shows. Shallowness plays a big part declarations of love are almost entirely based on sexual desire although the men are none the wiser to this nested down in their rationalisations of desire. Oki who both Professor Song and Jingu alterego of Hong are lovers of is a solipsist where men are concerned she knows this she has a selfawareness that is always lacking in the Hong men. She even tells Jingu at one point straight out that she is not a good person dead straight and he just brushes that under the mental carpet consumed by monomaniacal tunnel vision. During the same meal she says What can you do for me? and then covers up when she realises she has said it aloud!The final act of the movie sees Oki present a short film about her experiences with the two men a true revelation of their Emperor's New Clothes romances that is shockingly hilarious. What's more is that the soundtrack continuously plays Land of Hope and Glory throughout the movie the irony is just gutbusting.Watching Hong is an absolute revelation to me like lessons in human life I am actually staggered at how illuminating it has been to my personal life. Men in his films are neurotic shallow creatures and he's equally as damning with women. Prior to seeing Hong films and even though I'm thirty years old I had never ever seen solipsism in women I'm kind of an old romantic who was brought up to believe that women were somewhere between being mortal and being angels. Now it's a kind of lens that makes sense of a lot of things. I remember as a young teenager crashing my bike and a woman just breaking down into hysterical laughter even though I was injured and in agony it never made sense to me but you know if I think of seeing that and rather than it being real and objective it's just a kind of mental fresco that your unconscious mind is coming up with it actually is hilarious. I don't want to exaggerate its prevalence though and just like Hong I think these sort of prurient personality traits are sprinkled equally amongst men and women. They are different traits though and he makes the distance between men and women seem as yawning as the distance between the planets Mars and Venus.Hong seems to keep the same structure in his movies it's hard to follow the timelines there's always public drunkenness involving soju and he's always there as a character. I'm going to keep going with these though. Although on a visual level his films rarely offer much I actually consider a shot of pulsating vomit to be the shot of the London Film Festival out of circa 30 films scene.The line of the film is Song telling Jingu that he should read books on logic as it will do him good. It seemed to go over the head of the audience so watch out for it! Pure Genius.This is for Phil who I reckon will love Oki's Movie when it gets a wider release.".

	schema:headline " A Muse  An aging writer desiring his muse";
	schema:reviewBody "The man who desires after that girl is Lee JeokyoPark Haeil with lots of makeup. He is a poet who has been revered by many people as one of the giant figures of South Korean literature and the people even consider building the memorial museum for his achievement. He does not like being treated like an artifact so except accepting invitations from time to time he lives alone in a cozy country house somewhere outside Seoul.Although he is surrounded by many books in his library his career as a poet looks like having been terminated for a long time. He has been assisted by one of his pupils Seo JiwooKim Mooyeol. Jiwoo becomes famous because of his first novel which is not only critically acclaimed but also commercially successful. As his mentor Jeokyo should be proud of his pupil's success but he does not seem to be pleased a lot when he receives the book. None the less Jiwoo keeps coming to his mentor's house and he works for his mentor as an unofficial housekeeper and secretary he cooks the meal and he takes care of the daily appointments for Jeokyoo.On one day their daily life becomes a little different when they find a young high school girl waiting for them when they arrive at Jeokyoo's house. Her name is EungyoKim Goeun and she says she just comes to the house to get a parttime job. Jeokyou reluctantly hires her but while watching Eungyo's innocent beauty Jeokyo begins to feel something stirring in his heart. At one rainy night she comes to his house due to her personal reason and he lets her into his house. Though nothing much happens on that night he sees that he really wants Eungyo  but he also knows that he is a guy too old for the relationship with the girl idolized by him.As several local critics pointed out I have to admit that it was awkward to see Park Haeil as the aging character after watching his virile physical performance in South Korean action film War of the Arrows2011 in last year. He is currently 35 so it is rather hard to accept him as a man around 70 in spite of the makeup on his face and upper body. In fact he looks more natural when he plays the younger version of his character in the wistful fantasy sequence imagined by his character.But despite this undeniable awkwardness Park Haeil gives an adequate performance as a man who pathetically remains young at heart. Some old men do not learn much even after they become quite old and Jeokyoo is one of those silly examples. Maintaining its serious attitude the movie approaches to the hilarity of Hong Sangsoo's films sometimes and there is a funny scene where Jeokyoo almost risks his life just because he wants to look good and nice to Eungyo.If he were not an artist he would look merely silly. Struggling with the carnal yearning created many good works in the history of literature and the same thing can be said about Jeokyoo's circumstance. Maybe his body remains old and wrinkled but what do you know his aesthetical creativity in his heart is rejuvenated at full mode so his desire is sublimated into his new work which is probably as good as that famous Nabokov's novel.With his new work the situation gets more complicated due to the reason you should discover for yourself while watching the movie.

Though the movie is not successful in handling this triangle relationship between its main charactersI heard the book written by Park Bumsin did a better job we come to understand the true nature of the relationship between Jeok yo and Jiwoo who are bound to each other by the jealousy and admiration not in the way you expect.Between her coactors Kim Goeun gives the best performance in the film as the character who is a lot more than the object of the desire. While radiating unadulterated charm around the screen Kim Goeum makes us believe her obliviousness to her effects on the other characters and then she is convincingly transforms her character into a more active player in the story.

	onyx:emotionText "The man who desires after that girl is Lee JeokyoPark Haeil with lots of makeup. He is a poet who has been revered by many people as one of the giant figures of South Korean literature and the people even consider building the memorial museum for his achievement. He does not like being treated like an artifact so except accepting invitations from time to time he lives alone in a cozy country house somewhere outside Seoul.Although he is surrounded by many books in his library his career as a poet looks like having been terminated for a long time. He has been assisted by one of his pupils Seo JiwooKim Mooyeol. Jiwoo becomes famous because of his first novel which is not only critically acclaimed but also commercially successful. As his mentor Jeokyo should be proud of his pupil's success but he does not seem to be pleased a lot when he receives the book. None the less Jiwoo keeps coming to his mentor's house and he works for his mentor as an unofficial housekeeper and secretary he cooks the meal and he takes care of the daily appointments for Jeokyoo.On one day their daily life becomes a little different when they find a young high school girl waiting for them when they arrive at Jeokyoo's house. Her name is EungyoKim Goeun and she says she just comes to the house to get a parttime job. Jeokyou reluctantly hires her but while watching Eungyo's innocent beauty Jeokyo begins to feel something stirring in his heart. At one rainy night she comes to his house due to her personal reason and he lets her into his house. Though nothing much happens on that night he sees that he really wants Eungyo  but he also knows that he is a guy too old for the relationship with the girl idolized by him.As several local critics pointed out I have to admit that it was awkward to see Park Haeil as the aging character after watching his virile physical performance in South Korean action film War of the Arrows2011 in last year. He is currently 35 so it is rather hard to accept him as a man around 70 in spite of the makeup on his face and upper body. In fact he looks more natural when he plays the younger version of his character in the wistful fantasy sequence imagined by his character.But despite this undeniable awkwardness Park Haeil gives an adequate performance as a man who pathetically remains young at heart. Some old men do not learn much even after they become quite old and Jeokyoo is one of those silly examples. Maintaining its serious attitude the movie approaches to the hilarity of Hong Sangsoo's films sometimes and there is a funny scene where Jeokyoo almost risks his life just because he wants to look good and nice to Eungyo.If he were not an artist he would look merely silly. Struggling with the carnal yearning created many good works in the history of literature and the same thing can be said about Jeokyoo's circumstance. Maybe his body remains old and wrinkled but what do you know his aesthetical creativity in his heart is rejuvenated at full mode so his desire is sublimated into his new work which is probably as good as that famous Nabokov's novel.With his new work the situation gets more complicated due to the reason you should discover for yourself while watching the movie. While all these things happen Jiwoo is not particularly happy about what is happening between his mentor and a girl. Though the movie is not successful in handling this triangle relationship between its main charactersI heard the book written by Park Bumsin did a better job we come to understand the true nature of the relationship between Jeok yo and Jiwoo who are bound to each other by the jealousy and admiration not in the way you expect.Between her coactors Kim Goeun gives the best performance in the film as the character who is a lot more than the object of the desire.

At the end the movie is about the tragedy of loneliness for all the Professor Seo Ji Woo and Eungyo.

The closest this one comes to it is in the last five minutes where Eungyo realises what really happened. But there is no twist there is nothing that makes your heart jump  something Korean cinematography usually achieves very well. Usually the concept of Korean tragedy leaves you strangely inspired.

	schema:reviewBody "First off i would like to say that this movie didnt deserve the catagory III tag which usually involves alot of sex and violence...but in this case fails miserably. A fairly routine slasher flick that borrows from alot of other movies of the genre but doesnt really elaborate or improve on them. The main problem i had with the movie was that the chase and suspense scenes just seemed to fail the tension build up was let down by VERY predictable and silly scare tactics.The acting was pretty awful all around despite some pretty female cast members! well theres some eye candy at least.

A fairly routine slasher flick that borrows from alot of other movies of the genre but doesnt really elaborate or improve on them. The main problem i had with the movie was that the chase and suspense scenes just seemed to fail the tension build up was let down by VERY predictable and silly scare tactics.The acting was pretty awful all around despite some pretty female cast members! well theres some eye candy at least.

Those movies were not the greatest and neither is this.  If you've seen those you've seen this.

The characters who die are often unexpected members of the main castmaking this production unpredictable.Watching this film for the first time in the basement of a four story house with noone else in was the perfect setting for this film. From the very first scene I was gripped and I could not wait for the climax to discover the murderer and his motives. The script was extremely original as they had purposely set out to parody the typical slasher style movie.It was written in a way that deceived and tricked and had you jumping out of your seats but also laughing at the paradoxical black humor.

Well nothing against a nice pair of legs ey? We also see sexy Eunmi one of the only reasons to watch this movie. This girl is a sweetheart. That might explain why school weirdo Sungwook is very excited when she invites him to spend a weekend with her and her friend Huijung in a cottage. Lucky geek. So far so nice. Who wouldn't want to see that geek score with Eunmi? have I mentioned that she's really sexy?...But you won't. There's no scoring because now the film shifts tone. We see three young men entering the house beating the girls and slicing a huge knife into the poor boy. Wow that was a shocker. So what's this gonna be now? A slasher movie? Not really because it turns out that this was only a hoax. The boys didn't kill anyone it was only a set up to film a little horror movie. Got that so far? Well it gets more complicated because they accidentally DID kill Sungwook. The kids decide to get rid of the body and burn it. That second it turns out that Sungwook was NOT dead. He burns runs falls. And is dead. Or is he?One year later the kids get a message that basically says I Know What You Did Last Summer ... or something like that. From now on the movie just copies from UScounterparts like I Know and Scream. The only exception is that Eunmi is really sexy I just had to mention that ... well actually The Record gets worse than the USTeenieSlashers because those kids are REALLY dumb. They always separate for no apparent reason and they always search for the killer unarmed! Then when the killer appears they have to run away because hey they're unarmed! That gets really boring and once Eunmi who's really sexy by the way gets it there's not much reason to watch on. Did I mention that the ending is completely contrived? Well it is.So would I recommend The Record? Partially. As you might have guessed I'd recommend checking out Eunmi since she's really sweet. Plus the first couple of minutes are weird in a interesting way because they don't prepare you for what is coming up. Furthermore there are two cool death sequences Sungwook's pretty gory and the demise of the school's nurse whose legs we get to know quite well during this movie. The other deaths and horror moments are giveaways. They are badly edited and not that scary. Should I come to an end? OK I'd rate the movie 510 because Eunmi is really ... oh well you get the point.Rating 510".

Her range or emotion was truly gripping. Julien Boisselier as her brother Pierre is a tortured soul who has a coldness about him that was probably necessary to carry out the tasks they had to. Julie Depardieu as Jeanne Maya Sansa as Mariaare all good as is the stunning Marie Gillain but Dborah Franois as Galledid an amazing job showing her characters naivet and youth and some really strong and convincing emotions especially when captured. Colonel Heindrich is played by Moritz Bleibtreu who has had some criticism on here but in my opinion he carried it off perfectly. Many SS were ruthless and clinical and yet at the same time gentlemen and family men. A lot of this film is unrealistic and no doubt done for dramatic effect but the more you watch the more you get drawn in. I would highly recommend this film and would watch it again I am sure.".

	schema:reviewBody "A film that pays homage to the bravery of the women of SOE who parachuted into occupied France has long been overdue and in my opinion is still to be made as this film falls short of the mark however not as insultingly as the Charlotte Gray film did where the woman agent was portrayed as delicate and ditched her mission for the sake of a romance. For a European production this movie is surprisingly dumbed down and makes the same senseless historical mistakes usually associated with mechanically produced Hollywood films. This is no atmospheric masterpiece as the characters are shallow the script is too basic and the camera work is conventional. It feels as if the film were made in a hurry which is a shame as they definitely had the resources available to make it visually convincing with plenty of vintage cars Kubelwagens costumes planes trains and cool locations etc...This film could be OK for people who just want some eye candy for 90 minutes. Justice has so far only been made to the real women agents in books and it is scandalous how film makers have overlooked the potential for making a credible movie given the abundance of real and amazing material out there. Why Directors who have so far tackled this subject have ruined it all with fictional nonsenseis anybodies guess. If you are really interested in the subject you should read about agents such as Nancy Wake or the revealing book by Marcus Binney titled The women who lived for danger which tells the gripping stories of 10 different agents. There was also an excellent channel 4 documentary called The Real Charlotte Grays.Fiction vs historical fact Contains Spoilers............. As an avid reader of everything SOE I was groaning early on in this film as the historical facts were shamelessly trampled under foot by the director. First off they have Maurice Buckmaster telling war secrets to a woman who hasn't even decided whether to accept the mission yet. She then goes on to recruit women who are not interested in going which is an insult to the real agents as they were highly motivated people who were vetted by SOE on a very strict basis. Then the 5 agents go to France without any training and travel together on trains without taking any security measures. 5 agents together on a train? What were they thinking? Whatsmore they all get off at a main Paris station rather than get off one stop before and bus in to avoid the German presence they knew would be at all main stations...The story about the geologist on the beach a week before the Normandy invasion is just plain ridiculous. As if they didn't know the density of the sand till a week before the operation. Finally SOE never sent brothers and sisters or married couples together on missions for the simple fact that they could be tortured in front of each other to make them talk. When are they going to make The Movie about SOE?".

	schema:headline " Those Gals Really Are Something";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a very exciting and effective film about female espionage agents of the British S.O.E. Special Operations Executive during World War II. It is ironical that it is the French not the British who made this film in which only a few sentences of English are spoken. The English subtitles are really too rapid I must point out. Apart from a few scenes set in England the film effectively all takes place in Nazi Occupied France under the revolting Vichy Regime in 1944 where all the dangerous missions in the story take place. As the film proceeds we realize that the underlying threat is that the secrets of the DDay Normandy landings are in danger of being betrayed thus destroying their surprise value and enabling the Nazis to win the War. So the stakes could not be higher. According to titles shown at the end of the film this story is in many respects true and the lead character played with tremendous bitter panache by Sophie Marceau only died as recently as 2004 at the age of 98! As she was a French woman though working as an agent for the SOE and her brother worked for De Gaulle's Free French in London that must explain why her story was known in France and why it was French producers who decided to film it. The story as filmed contains countless inaccuracies of procedure and plot which could never really have happened and some details are ridiculous a sister and brother sent on the same mission together!?. So the story has been greatly hypedup to 'Hollywoodize' it by the French Hollywood which we might perhaps call by the name of TuileriewoodenSeine or TileTown as opposed to TinselTown 'a night out on the tiles' being a good description for some Paris evenings. The film starts rather slowly and one is not certain that it is going to work at first. But when it gets into its stride it is gripping and coherent. There are many grisly scenes of torture by the Gestapo which take a strong stomach and seeing Nazis savagely and maniacally beating up women and nearly drowning them in water tanks even pulling out their finger nails this is done to the delicately beautiful actress Deborah Francois who appears as fragile as the petals of a fluttering chamomile flower on a windy day is more than merely upsetting. However it was obviously decided by the producers that these pretty young women were to be treated with as much grit as men both in their actions and in the depiction of their fates. It is no bad thing to remind viewers of how the Nazis behaved and that they really did these things. There are some detailed touches which add to the horror of it all a Gestapo woman clerk sits impassively at a small wooden table making notes wholly unmoved by the agonized shrieks and screams of the women being tortured in front of her. As for the Nazi SS colonel supervising all of this and trying to get the information out of them he could not be more bored and oblivious to the suffering and the screams which to him are merely tedious. To the Nazis torturing human beings was no different from stepping on ants. If it accomplishes nothing else perhaps this film will make a few young people think for a moment about a War which to them is now 'long ago and far away' and why should they be interested. Just seeing a screen title informing us that the Gestapo's Paris Headquarters was in Avenue Foch is enough to precipitate a mild attack of hysteria. That is where all the billionaires now live in luxury. I have been in a couple of their grand houses and all I can say is 'Nom de Dieu!' And to think that it was in those surroundings where the superrich now besport themselves with their vintage Cristal champagne I must admit it is delicious but no one really needs it that the Gestapo pulled out the finger nails of beautiful girls in their early twenties and thought nothing of it merely finding their screams of pain a bore! Do see this film if only to be horrified and appalled but also to admire the courage of the women not only the men who gave their lives to defeat the greatest evil that befell a muchaccursed earth during the 20th century the regime of the monstrous instruments of Evil who dared to call themselves a Master Race.".

According to titles shown at the end of the film this story is in many respects true and the lead character played with tremendous bitter panache by Sophie Marceau only died as recently as 2004 at the age of 98! As she was a French woman though working as an agent for the SOE and her brother worked for De Gaulle's Free French in London that must explain why her story was known in France and why it was French producers who decided to film it. The story as filmed contains countless inaccuracies of procedure and plot which could never really have happened and some details are ridiculous a sister and brother sent on the same mission together!?. So the story has been greatly hypedup to 'Hollywoodize' it by the French Hollywood which we might perhaps call by the name of TuileriewoodenSeine or TileTown as opposed to TinselTown 'a night out on the tiles' being a good description for some Paris evenings. The film starts rather slowly and one is not certain that it is going to work at first. But when it gets into its stride it is gripping and coherent. There are many grisly scenes of torture by the Gestapo which take a strong stomach and seeing Nazis savagely and maniacally beating up women and nearly drowning them in water tanks even pulling out their finger nails this is done to the delicately beautiful actress Deborah Francois who appears as fragile as the petals of a fluttering chamomile flower on a windy day is more than merely upsetting. However it was obviously decided by the producers that these pretty young women were to be treated with as much grit as men both in their actions and in the depiction of their fates. It is no bad thing to remind viewers of how the Nazis behaved and that they really did these things. There are some detailed touches which add to the horror of it all a Gestapo woman clerk sits impassively at a small wooden table making notes wholly unmoved by the agonized shrieks and screams of the women being tortured in front of her. As for the Nazi SS colonel supervising all of this and trying to get the information out of them he could not be more bored and oblivious to the suffering and the screams which to him are merely tedious. To the Nazis torturing human beings was no different from stepping on ants. If it accomplishes nothing else perhaps this film will make a few young people think for a moment about a War which to them is now 'long ago and far away' and why should they be interested. Just seeing a screen title informing us that the Gestapo's Paris Headquarters was in Avenue Foch is enough to precipitate a mild attack of hysteria. That is where all the billionaires now live in luxury. I have been in a couple of their grand houses and all I can say is 'Nom de Dieu!' And to think that it was in those surroundings where the superrich now besport themselves with their vintage Cristal champagne I must admit it is delicious but no one really needs it that the Gestapo pulled out the finger nails of beautiful girls in their early twenties and thought nothing of it merely finding their screams of pain a bore! Do see this film if only to be horrified and appalled but also to admire the courage of the women not only the men who gave their lives to defeat the greatest evil that befell a muchaccursed earth during the 20th century the regime of the monstrous instruments of Evil who dared to call themselves a Master Race.";

What makes Les Femmes de L'ombre shine is that it features the typically unsung contributors to the war effortthe heroines who shared the same audacity and love of country and liberty as the men.Aside from its cast of four gorgeous French women and an equally delightful Italian it features a simple but clever agendathe actions of a cell of saboteurs and assassins working for the British Special Operations Executive SOE in occupied France. There are no fantastic stories hereno plots to kill Hitler or to sabotage atomic research. Instead the story narrows its focus to the extraordinary efforts to keep secret the particulars of the inevitable invasion of the European continent by the Allies. This is no small order and there is much suffering in keeping what must remain secret.The emotions in the film are well played by the actors and actresses. During the few brutal but necessary scenes the cries of anguish and pain are real and powerfully emotive. Louise Sophie Marceau is convincing as a vengeful widow who works alongside her dedicated brother Pierre Julien Boisselier. Jeanne Julie Depardieu daughter of the famous French actor Gerard Depardieu plays a callous whore motivated at first by remission of her prison sentence then by money then by revenge. Galle Dborah Franois portrays the nave religious girl who is seemingly the only true French patriot of the group. Maria Maya Sansa is a driven Italian Jew whose family met its fate in a concentration camp. The most reluctant member is the lovely Suzy Marie Gillain whose questionable past allied her with the most unlikely of characters Colonel Heindrich Moritz Bleibtreu of the Wehrmacht and the film's major antagonist. Unexpected support comes from local profiteer Eddy Vincent Rottiers whose connection to Colonel Heindrich enables the saboteurs to get close to him to fulfill their mission.If there's a noticeable weakness to the film it is Bleibtreu cast as a Nazi colonel. He's neither evil nor intimidating. He lacks the sinister persona of Colonel Landa Christoph Waltz of Inglourious Basterds a decidedly less serious film of the genre. Where Colonel Heindrich should have been clever and cruel his performance instead is wooden and uninspiring. Bleibtreu may be a little out of his realm in a role so serious.Les Femmes de L'ombre is a solid contribution to the WWII films of the last decade. I hope it inspires more stories of the Resistance to be told with attention to the incredible sacrifices and dedication of normal people confronted with the horrors of Nazism.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is probably based on true events but the keyword here is based as in very remotely based. I think the blame should be put on the writer and director who did an incredibly poor job out of a potential hit messing it up to the point of turning a wartime thriller into a hilarious comedy with no intention of doing so.The scenario lacked credibility from beginning to end. After a mere day of training these poor girls manage to parachute at night without even a scratch perform a perfectly synchronized strip show on music they'd never heard before and without the slightest possibility of a rehearsal.Sophie the sharpshooter doesn't hold her breath while aiming holds her rifles on both occasions at the shoulder without support hence shaking like a leaf yet hitting her targets in the darkest of nights at the start of the film and later missing an unmissable shot in the subway with a stateoftheart rifle in perfect conditions.At one point the girls get into a shootout at the hospital and hold their Stens at arm's length like a bunch of dirty diapers without getting their wrists damaged by the recoil and of course hitting their targets square on instead of shooting at birds.Such scenes were highly reminiscent of Charlie's Angels at their best although the latter film is intended to be seen as funnily overthetop whereas the former is supposed to be realistic and based on true events.If all these failings were not sufficient to trigger bouts of hilarious laughter in the audience the scenario pushes on and arranges for the girls to always be at the right spot at the right time with the right contacts help and equipment as though they had planned and rehearsed all the mishaps of their mission hundreds of times beforehand a bit in the style of James Bond films. Simply not credible for such a story.The director jumps continuously from one scene to the next without the slightest hint of fluidity nor continuity in the manner of a Marvel's comic. The girls look panicked throughout but yet manage to make all the right moves with nerves of steel with a clear vision of when to hit or shoot or walk instead of running and yet fail to kill the bad guy on so many occasions until the very end as prescribed by the confused scenario naturally.The sobbing looks fake in nearly all relevant scenes. The girls' characters evolve erratically in all psychological directions as though they'd had weeks to think through what was happening to them and change their minds. The scenes of torture and suicide by cyanide pill have an air of strange impressionism derived from a 70's film by Godard. The bad Nazis have the look and feel of choir boys.In short it feels like a girlie's remake of Inglorious Basterds shallow as hell making very little sense or rather asking the viewer to mentally fill the gaps where the director lacked the time or skill or both to package an otherwise interesting story into a sensible unit.Contrary to some comments I've read the French know how to make excellent action films write credible scenarii and act convincingly probably more so than most productions made in Hollywood. Unfortunately les femmes de l'ombre is a very bad example and shouldn't be seen as a landmark of French filmmaking unless of course one looks at it as a comical parody of a wouldbe serious wartime story in which case it remarkably hits the jackpot.I can't go so far as to recommend against watching it because given enough imagination and little attention to detail I wouldn't be surprised if someone found something interesting in it after all. I mean let's face it if you're a teenage girl or a romantic grandma you'll probably like it.".

So why bother. Glad you asked that. For one thing L'Armee des ombres was made in 1969 forty years ago as near as damn it and while Lucie Aubrac is much more recent eleven years is still a long time between drinks. JeanPaul Salome' hasn't really done much to prepare us for the excellence on display here though his last effort Arsene Lupin some four years ago also shunned the modern day. It's a given that French film actresses are as a body pound for pound just about the best in the world and Salome' hasn't needed to go with the really heavy hitters to find four very fine actresses. Domestically and arguably outside France as well Sophie Marceau owns the highest profile having made a major impact as a teenager in Boum. Youngest and with the smallest cv is Deborah Francois at 21 but even she has The Child and The Page Turner behind her and both went international. Julie Depardieu and Marie Gillain are more interesting and it is for me at least a pleasure to see them getting some international exposure  and the same goes for Julien Boissellier who has done some great work in France but has barely been seen outside it. The premise is classic and the factual element  the character of Louise Marceau was decorated and enjoyed a long life  does no harm whatsoever we're in very early June 1944 and with DDay less than a week away it is essential to maintain secrecy and rescue the one man  a geologist  who is the lynchpin. Accordingle brother and sister Marceau and Boissellier recruit three more French girls working in England and sign them up for this oneoff mission. The geologist once rescued reveals that the leading German on the scene is aware that something is going down and very soon. This decides Boissellier to keep the girls and move to Paris. Salome' keeps it moving and gets great performances out of everyone making this a great addition to Resistance movies in general and one I can't wait to acquire on DVD.".

Look elsewhere for a synopsis. But... potential spoiler This movie starts out as a female agent movie but towards the end it has become rather a film about female being dressed naked tortured beaten. Which makes it into a very sad movie indeed. Namely because women being dressed naked tortured and beaten is not good entertainment at least for those of us who love women. I present this as an alternative view review because other people might say it would be necessary to show the cruelty of war others might say it's not over the top cruel... the scenes could be worse and would have to be more explicit detailed if you where to call it a bad movie. There is many who likes this movie. But be warned... you might be offended you might find it to be bad taste... at least thats my conclusion.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1944 in London Lieutenant Pierre Desfontaines Julien Boisselier assigns his sister Louise Desfontaines Sophie Marceau to convince three other women to form a fivewoman task force under his command to rescue a British geologist from a German hospital in the countryside of France. The geologist was assigned by Colonel Maurice Buckmaster Colin David Reese in a reconnaissance mission of the soil of the beaches at Normandy for the DDay and had been captured by the Germans. Louise and Pierre force the whore Jeanne Faussier Julie Depardieu that is imprisoned for murdering her pimp the explosives expert Galle Lemenech Dborah Franois that misses action and the former dancer and fianc of Colonel Karl Heindrich Moritz Bleibtreu Suzy Desprez Marie Gillain using blackmail and unethical methods to fly to France and join the Italian agent Maria Luzzato Maya Sansa in the assignment. They are wellsucceeded but when they deliver the geologist to the British airplane Pierre betrays the group and does not allow the women to fly back to London. He forces them to travel to Paris to kill Colonel Heindrich that suspects that the landing of the allied forces will be through the Normandy in a dangerous mission. Les Femmes de l'Ombre is a sort of French Inglorious Female Bastards. The plot recalls the 1978 Italian film Quel Maledetto Treno Blindato a.k.a. Inglorious Bastards with three rogue women assigned to a very dangerous mission in occupied France. The plot is absurd but entertains with the women having oneday training and parachuting in the night and attacking a German hospital full of soldiers in a wellsynchronized operation. The characters are not welldeveloped and inconsistent and Louise is a nurse and a sniper Jeanne is a selfish whore capable to selfsacrifice for a cause Liliane hates Heindrich but when she sees him she changes Galle is expert in explosives and absolutely unsuitable for the second mission. The greatest problem in this film is the reference that it is based on a true story. My vote is six.Title Brazil Contratadas para Matar Hired to Kill".

Something has happened to her. She can now act and seems to be making up for lost time. She was absolutely terrific!! This flick about four women chosen blackmailed and coerced to work for the British as secret agents in occupied France during WWII is one excellent and original work. It's based on an actual woman who did the things depicted here during WWII. Watch the credits at the end of the film for her story.I've seen a lot of tough women on TV and in cinema. None compare to this crew. All except Sophie Marceau start out as hesitant and somewhat weak. That doesn't last long. In no time at all they're jumping out of planes shooting their way across France coldly and ruthlessly murdering every German who stands in front of them. They get captured rescued tortured blow things up etc. but still remain fearless and inventive. The mission is what counts not their safety. This is the best flick I've seen in a long time and the very best action chick flick ever made.".

The attempt to get him out proves to be an immense job in which the women will show their courage but at the same time it will be a high price to pay for some in the group.Director JeanPaul Salome working with cowriter Laurent Vachaud gives the audience an action packed film. The emphasis is to show the valor of these French women at a time when their country was divided and also everyone felt the humiliation of the Nazi occupation. The partisan movement worked hard behind the scenes to try and exterminate the enemy from their soil at all costs.Sophie Marceau is fine as usual as Louise. The others in the group Julie Depardieu Marie Gillain and Deborah Francois do also good work for director Salome.

This time we follow Harald Kim Bodnia as he is released from jail only to get involved in a plot to get Swedish serial killer Ludvig Torkel Petterson out of prison so he can meet his estranged father The Monk Jens Okking. Once again peppered with funny dialogue not as inspired as the original but with one hilarious scene in which the cooks and Harald futilely tries to speak English to a Swedish hotel receptionist. The car stunts are still clumsy a notch above the sloppy action sequences from the first film and the film is loaded with a high mortality rate but it's uneven and substitutes black humor with a mean spirit and even asks us to care about these characters after putting them through numerous outlandish situations and hurling credibility out the window. Kim Bodnia plays it straight but his tough guy act is getting a little tired by now but Tomas Villum Jensen and Nikolaj Lie Kaas still make a great comic duo as the putupon sidekicks. Iben Hjejle is lovely as Ludvig's loveinterest but her role is badly written even though she gets to punch Bodnia in the face. Jacob Haugaard gets some laughs too as a seedy doctor. Note to writer Anders Thomas Jensen A couple of anachronistic goofs. The film is supposed to take place before the first film which was released in 1999. If this film is set before that they couldn't have crossed the bridge between Denmark and Sweden as it wasn't built at that time and the national football league wasn't sponsored by SAS then either.The supernatural elements of the first film are totally ignored this time around. Okay entertainment but doesn't hold up to close scrutiny. ".

	schema:reviewBody "The 1999 Danish black comedy In China They Eat Dogs brought an enjoyable gust of fresh air to the often overly serious Nordic cinema. The prequel Old Men in New Cars casts light on the characters' earlier life Harald Kim Bodnia has just been released from prison and owes a large sum of money to a gangster named Ratko Slavko Labovic but doesn't let the debt bother him very much. After his dying father figure Munken Jens Okking asks Harald to locate his estranged son Ludvig Torkel Petersson Harald and his cook friends Martin and Peter Nikolaj Lie Kaas and Tomas Villum Jensen and their new inept assistant Vuk Brian Patterson come up with a plan to get Ludvig a multiple murderer with a sensitive side out of a Swedish prison. While robbing a bank they also they also become attached to a suicidal woman Mille Iben Hjejle who tags along and evokes new kinds of feelings in Ludvig. Next it is time for an elaborate airplane hijacking...The main difference to the first movie is the absence of the mildmannered Arvid arguably the protagonist of In China They Eat Dogs. Instead the prequel focuses on Harald and his evercalm attitude to whatever obstacles life drops in front of him. The semireluctant Martin and Peter are the same as before providing a lot of comedy with their awkward insecurity when things get rough and bodies start piling up not to mention the always hapless Vuk who keeps getting seriously injured as a running gag in both movies. The main charm of the humour still lies in the deadpan delivery of the gang's outrageously implausible schemes be it a prison break by bungee cord or an airplane robbery with an ambulance.The action scenes while not as numerous as in Hollywood blockbusters are well designed and both entertaining and exciting. Especially the car chase after the bank robbery deserves a special mention rarely do we get to see such wreckage in any normal Nordic thriller. The actors also do a good job especially Kaas and Jensen are great as the manipulatable henchmen of the menacing Kim Bodnia but Iben Hjejle is a joy to watch as well. Even though the absence of Arvid seems disappointing at first it soon becomes obvious that Torkel Petersson's Ludvig is more than enough to replace him  Ludvig's homicidal tendencies mix with his caring side rather hilariously.The familiar absurd undercurrent is still strong and the humour and action are in good balance so those who enjoyed In China They Eat Dogs have no reason to miss out Old Men in New Cars. In the first movie there was a serious theme under the surface namely a mildmannered man's desire to be true to himself and while the prequel feels a bit more straightforward it also presents a dramatic story about familial love. In any case both films belong among the best Danish films I have seen in a good while.".

In any case both films belong among the best Danish films I have seen in a good while.";

It's a blackcomedy so it's not supposed to be taken to serious. If you do take it seriously you'r in for 95 minutes of cynical meaningless violence. Well in that case this movie probably isn't for you. As for me i found it hysterical!The action sequences are a bit over the top one might say. Then i sayc'mon c'mon it's a comedy! at any rate the surreal car chases and what not is just stating this fact. The effects aren't Hollywoodish but still not bad for Nordic production as far as i can see. The dialogue is a work of art itself. Some conversations is just random nonsense but still just makes the character more believable. And some good linguistic jokesspoofs to unfortunately some may get lost in translation. With the absurd mix of characters ranging from sociopathic to suicidal some just plain insane you know you'r in for a good pitch black comedy!By the way I have seen I Kina Spiser de Hunde as well but i didn't find it funny in comparison to this movie. So i like to look at it as two separate movies.. or independent movies or whatever... just my angle".

That said this movie is stuffed with black humour and amazing dialogue. Actionmovies not the official genre of the movie but still its actionpacked made to happen in Scandinavia aren't really realistic so its a good thing this movie realizes this and just as well exaggerates the whole thing  and makes it all even more hilarious. I also enjoyed the linguistic humour concerning the communication problems between the Swedish and the Danish something lots of Scandinavians would recognize themselves in. See we're supposed to understand everything that we all say but its not always that easy Now i haven't seen In china they eat dogs yet but I'm planning to so i cannot really compare the two movies.

From my standpoint it fails at both genres. If you want to see a great underground movie see Reservoir Dogs.

Then we have Iben Hjejle who plays a woman who'se become mentally unstable after her boyfriend leaves her Dan whom we are briefly introduced to by chance later in the movie. These two characters seem to engage in some sort of twisted relationship leaving the audience unsure whether the next scene will present the two in either loving or murderous surroundings. Of course we also have Kim Bodnia who plays the everunpleasent ruffian Harald. I had no sympathy for this character in neither movie but thought that it was a tailormade role for Kim Bodnia. The comic relief is undoubtfully the hilarious pairing of Tomas Villum and Nikolaj Lie Kaas who play two chefs who are always caught in the middle of things while all they really want to do is cook vi er jo bare kokke for fanden...

This is supposed to be a prequel to In China They Eat Dogs but it stands very well on its own. The characters we already know from In China They Eat Dogs are the same as is the weird black humor. It lacks the two supernatural beings from the first film but you don't really miss them. On the other hand there is more action and more violence in it than in In China They Eat Dogs. And it is really funny. When I think about some of the scenes I still have to laugh.Possible spoilers aheadThe film is about Harald who just released from jail wants to fulfill the last wish of his dying foster father He wants to see his son. Of course nobody knew he actually had a son. The son Ludvig sits in a Swedish jail. So our heroes Harald and his two cooks and Vuk of course get him out of jail only to learn that he is a serial killer that starts his obsession as soon as he gets the chance. And then of course there are our Croatian friends this time all dressed in black Tshirts with a doubleheaded eagle on the front and huge and I mean HUGE golden necklaces whom Harald owes money. Harald also needs money to get his foster father a liver transplant in  Southern America to save his life. After a bank robbery which fails the Croatians suggest he rob an airplane while it is about to take two containers with money on board. Now just imagine a deadly sick old man who is drugged with opium and the last time he flew a plane was about 40 years ago on the control stick and the police trying to stop the plane... anybody who is afraid to fly should close his eyes during that scene or you'll never get in a plane again. Absolutely hilarious. And the tricks they used in that sequence are really good. As are the car stunts.There are several dead bodies lots of car crashes the Swedish get their share the plans our heroes try to carry out are totally impracticable but they do it anyway and somehow they succeed with them well almost and in the end everybody is happy. Well most of them.I hope this film gets released Europe wide soon because I have to watch it again. Great entertainment though not for the whole family.".

Oddly enough the film seems to begin as something of a parody of Pusher which I assume was intentional especially considering that the films also share another actor in a nearly identical role. From there the film more or less progresses in it's silly oddball way completely unengaging but totally harmless. It seemed to jerk unsteadily between conventional mainstream lowbrow comedy and what I can only assume is a more specified Danish brand of dark humor. Of the two I definitely preferred the latter that is in the brief moments when I could understand it. Sometimes I had the feeling that even then I was missing the jokes and possibly laughing at unintended things. I have to admit that I found the most pleasure in this film from imagining it being remade as a sequel to Wes Anderson's Bottle Rocket for whatever that is worth.".

While I enjoy some of these darker films like Oldboy Mother and I Saw the Devil it's refreshing to see a Korean film that doesn't leave you feeling sick or depressed after the curtain falls.This movie has the usual themes covered in coming of age stories but also deals with other issues relevant to modern Korean society such as the treatment of foreign laborers and the disabled by a Korean culture that isn't always welcoming to outsiders. All that said the highlight of this movie is the relationship between Wan Deuki and his teacher. This is the source of a great deal of humor and warmth throughout the movie and will make you laugh out loud more than other Korean movie I can think of. Even if you are unfamiliar with Korean culture and cinema if you watch this you won't be disappointed. Don't be fooled by the low IMDb rating of this film check it out!".

With some romance for both characters thrown in. Which is a shame cause from the trailer I was expecting some unexpected and yet effective drama with some good amount of humor. The humor is just really bland in this movie and the story isn't anything special. The only thing that stands out is how there are actually these types of students living in Korea so it can be relatable. The building of the bond between the student and the teacher goes in a pretty much narrow direction. I was more interested in the romance between the teacher and the next door neighbor. But that was disappointing as well. Overall this is a disappointing movie about a teacher trying to motivate a student.3.810".

	schema:headline " Sincere look into suicide";
	schema:reviewBody "'Bleak Night' is a remarkable movie. Not only does it delve into highly emotionally charged territory without going into theatrics as it does so through clever shooting techniques that lend it a very true to life feel.The plot kicks off with a bereaved father looking for answers his teenage son having committed suicide. What follows are a series of interviews with the boy's friends interwoven with flashbacks so that the narrative progresses on two levels the present and the past. Here lies one of the strengths of 'Bleak Nights' the natural way in which the flashbacks are introduced. Memories are spliced into the story without actually breaking the narrative proper even as the highlight the changes that the tragic event had on everyone involved.This is an environment where violence seems underneath every interaction an all boys high school bordering on the delinquent side. And yet there are light hearted moments of daily happiness such and playing mock baseball at the railtrack or going to the beach with friends. These interludes serve as contrast to the overall effect of bleakness thus giving it another dimension.The dead boy is something of a wannabe gangster. He is the leader of a group of boys and has no qualms bullying even friends. More than just violent he seems to be emotionally unstable swinging between bouts of uncalled for aggression to contrite admissions of guilt that again result in more and even increased violence. It is a hopeless cycle that little by little costs him all of his friends and results in utter alienation.There are hints that the tension behind this angst may be denial over homosexual tendencies but like most things the movie does more hinting than outright stating. Events are revisited from different points of view so that the viewer is treated to a multiple perspective that yet does not reveal everything.The shots are mostly closeups or inserted so that the characters seem to be just at hand. It creates a sense of partnership with the viewers as if we too were inside the screen instead of merely witnessing it all unfold. There is a certain voyeuristic quality but it is elevated by this sincere approach. The movie remains highly realistic and as such believable by its being so understated.All this could only be achieved with an excellent cast and noone disappoints in this respect. From the boy himself to his father and his former friends all are credible in their respective roles. Particularly interesting is the exbest friend whose reaction to betrayal become a turning point of sorts. It is through the interactions with him that we learn that there was more to the dead boy than a troublemaker that he understands all too well that such behavior is necessary to stand atop the school hierarchy and yet how little it matters in the grand scheme of things for come graduation it will all be over and the underlings so faithful the day before will disappear.It captures a paradox that is very true of high school life it both seems to go on forever and yet it is gone in an instant. The boys are all trapped in this kind of warped time and trapped even more by their unwillingness to face up to what happened.While not long the movie manages to tackle many issues such as the breakdown of family ties the catastrophic importance attached to reputation and how they can ruin someone's life in an all too literal sense the failure of the education system to provide guidance to youths. These are weighty themes conveyed through the characters so that 'Bleak Night' never loses sight of the fact that these are issues that affect real people. Despite the fact that the conclusion is known beforehand the boy has killed himself the end still packs a punch. By gathering all of the resources that make 'Bleak Night' so exceptional the excellent acting the splicing in of always relevant flashback scenes the camera's approach that puts the viewer on the same level as the characters the final scene offers us a dialogue that will never happen but that could have corrected everything if it had.There are no easy solutions in this movie. The tone remains one of sadness and regret through and through. This is not a story of redemption although it may be there at the very end of the line it does not need to be 'Bleak Night' is about despair guilt and ultimately coming to terms with how one's actions impact others. And in that it achieves nothing short of brilliance.".

	schema:reviewBody "...Friends ones we can depend on...I would have given this film an eight however I was able to empathize with the main character in this masterpiece of a film and the persona characterized by Lee JeHoon was truly exceptional.Foremost there were no vibrant colors as a theme throughout the film. The colors were mostly melancholy which rightly so sets the tone for this movie as gothica666 previously reviewed the tone remains one of sadness and regret through and through. This film is neither about suicide nor about homosexuality despite some red herrings. Yes suicide does play a significant role but to a lesser extent in contrast to friendship. The way I see it is that GiTae values friendship more so than does his best friends. We see it when he goes to great lengths to preserve his relationships with his best friends such as rejecting a girl who HeeJoon crushes on but only to be misunderstood by said friend.The way GiTae expresses his love might be confused as homoerotic but the way I see it is as platonic. His platonic relationship with HeeJoon and DongYoon fills the void left by the absence of love he receives from his family. But his platonic love for his best friends is unrequited and therein lies the problem. GiTae acts up because he feels as if he is losing them. His temperamental behavior are attempts at salvaging what he has left. He has no mother his father is not there when needed and yet he has his best friends. His behavior and how things are being misunderstood start to unravel the tight bond if it was in the first place they had created with each other. Ultimately this leads to a betrayal of friendships. People who you thought were your best friends suddenly become strangers to you. Sadly this betrayal led to GiTae's depression and his unfortunate demise.All in all I truly enjoyed this film. From the beginning we know how the story ends but what we don't know is how we will get there. On that ride towards the climax we can feel the anxiety building and see what a tragedy it is. It may not have exciting scenes but it does have reality.".

It truly illustrates the expression less is more. No it was not abounding in action thrills car racesand the like but requires the viewer to actually engage his intellect as he observes the gradual selfdestruction of the so called leader of the pack. The film carries you along effortlessly as it envelopes you with deep resentmentsguilt jealousiesand low selfesteem issues. All this angst is interwoven with a realism rarely experienced in other films. I give it a resounding 1010!!".

I like my movies to have entertainment plot motive movement and reason. For me this movie had none of the above. I think movies like this like to call themselves art and I suppose on some level they are which is why so many people seem to flock to them and want to 'understand' and praise them. Anyway back to the movie. It's a drag slow going to the point of being a bit boring. I wanted to get into it but found it hard to even figure why one of the character's motives that fuelled the whole plot. Although I don't want everything handed to me on a plate I would like to find some answers as to why the characters and plot are even in front of me you gain little in that respect. Nothing is explained and it ends rather abruptly. If you like movies like 'Meek's Cut off' you will most likely love this movie I however would much rather have watched paint dry. On the upside the actors were decent and it was shot nicely but other than that big old' blah.".

Macau Park brought Chinese thieves as well but little did they know what Macau Park planned for each one of them. His plan takes an unexpected turn when Popeye brings Pepsi a genius safecracker and old flame of Macau Park to settle the old score. The thieves' target is a 20 million diamond known as 'Tear of the Sun' kept safely away in a casino brought there to be sold by a notorious Chinese fence. While working together to steal this fabled diamond they all have their own agenda to keep the diamond for themselves. But who will succeed and live to see another day?";

	schema:reviewBody "There are many aspects of this film that distinctly separates it from others. For one the characterization  it's superb. Over time through development and flashback the characters become significantly fleshed out and though the audience may initially appreciate a character at the beginning of the narrative by the end it might be an entirely different story our loyalties continuously shifting as do those of the individuals on screen.Secondly the stunts the fact the feature isn't filled with continuous action sequences allows us to appreciate them so much more. They are brilliantly executed highly exhilarating and occasionally even with suspension of disbelief applied beyond fathomable. Thirdly the script  characters are witty sassy and subtly cutthroat. Never is the script reduced to slapstick or clich oneliners the well executed humor at the hands of the talented actors being as fresh and fluid as one could ever hope to witness.Fourthly the suspense. Alongside some of the hectic stunts the film offers nailbiting entertainment as loyalties are tested and plans abseil out of control to the extent the question isn't so much 'who will walk away with the prize?' as it is 'whose going to come out of this alive?' Fifthly the music  it's rarely too serious or too laid back immersing the viewer into the experience. Sixth the visuals  their gorgeous. Macau and Hong Kong vibrantly come to life in a mixture of dazzling bright colors supported by brilliant framing and directing that is truly captivating. In this sense the feature isn't just an entertaining thrill ride  it's a gorgeous vacation  with guns and thieves and gold.Yenicall Gianna Jun who is especially outstanding in this film is a superbly athletic thief working alongside a crew consisting of Chewingum Kim HaeSook and Zampano Kim SooHyun the leader of their outfit Popie Lee JungJae finding them a job working with an old partner of his Macao Park Kim YunSeok who he detests for reasons that are explained over the course of the feature.Trust is a luxury that is unaffordable and even less so when the South Korean team travel to Hong Kong to meet an equally talented group of Chinese thieves they will be working with over the duration of the job to steal the Tear of the Sun a prized diamond that can be sold for 20 million. Leading the Chinese team is Chen Simon Yam alongside Andrew Oh DalSu Johnny Kwok Cheung Tsang and Julie Angelica Lee. The character who is most shocked of all however is Macao to discover that Popie has brought with him an undisclosed thief recently released from prison Pepsee Kim HyeSoo whose loathing of Macao's character alongside her love for him is explored throughout the film.Though there are more men participating in the film than women the story fantastically allows the women to continuously be at the forefront of the plot each of them with sizable engaging roles that occasionally overshadow their male counterparts. With each of the thieves having agendas of their own and with nothing been too sacred or too illegal to try the ever continuous suspense constantly submerges the audience as they try to figure out who will experience as Yenicall calls it a 'happy ending.' There's little else I can write to convince you dear reader to watch this particular film except  you will be doing yourself a serious disservice by not doing so.".

Leading the Chinese team is Chen Simon Yam alongside Andrew Oh DalSu Johnny Kwok Cheung Tsang and Julie Angelica Lee. The character who is most shocked of all however is Macao to discover that Popie has brought with him an undisclosed thief recently released from prison Pepsee Kim HyeSoo whose loathing of Macao's character alongside her love for him is explored throughout the film.Though there are more men participating in the film than women the story fantastically allows the women to continuously be at the forefront of the plot each of them with sizable engaging roles that occasionally overshadow their male counterparts. With each of the thieves having agendas of their own and with nothing been too sacred or too illegal to try the ever continuous suspense constantly submerges the audience as they try to figure out who will experience as Yenicall calls it a 'happy ending.' There's little else I can write to convince you dear reader to watch this particular film except  you will be doing yourself a serious disservice by not doing so.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Thieves is a 2012 Korean heistcaper film. Here's your story Gather a bunch of thieves  criminals together to hatch a plan to steal a diamond. That's it!...Well Almost!SPOILERS AHEAD!The comparisons to this film being a Korean version of Ocean's Eleven simply can't be avoided. And if you're asking Why should I waste my time watching that? The answer is because IT IS a KOREAN VERSION!When you watch Ocean's Eleven you know the worst thing that will happen to Clooney  Pitt  the Gang is a couple of punches in the face andor slaps on the wrist or maybe some minimal jail time. There's nothing wrong with that it can all be great fun when done well. But this is a Korean production so Anything Goes Here!!! and it certainly does Go!.This movie has a quite a bit going for it. First  foremost the acting is top notch throughout and each of actors and actresses they gathered together here get their chance to strut their stuff. The cast is packed full of talented stars in Asia anyway and it's really hard to take your eyes off of any one person when it's their time to step to the plate regardless of age sex or role. Everyone really plays off each other quite well so much so that it seems they've been working together as a cohesive unit for some time this is even all the more impressive when you consider this is a Pan Asian ensemble cast that has to overcome language barriers while snappily working their way through some well scripted and witty dialogue. The film eventually tightens its focus more on the Korean stars for the most part but this is a Korean production so that is to be expected.The story is pretty decent overall nothing fancy or overly challenging at least until your figure out who's doing what to whom and what everybody's motives are. The first half of the film primarily brings everybody together to work on the plan to steal the diamond while revealing their past histories and present interpersonal relationships. The second half ultimately brings all their story lines and individual objectives to a head under a heavy dose of fairly impressive action scenes.Production values are quite high here and it might be the most slickly made and stylized film I've ever seen come out of Asia. I'm used to seeing increasingly high production values from Asian cinema over the last decade plus but this film is really pushing the limits of what an Asian Big Picture can be. If this is what bodes for the future of this type of Asian action cinema then I'm on board 100! PROVIDED they don't lose their heart  soul along the way which is what made films from this part of the world so enticing to begin with.Perhaps what I like best about this movie is that it is just flat out sexy and I don't mean that in a 'let's get naked  have sex kind of way'. It just oozes a certain kind of sex appeal and undercurrent throughout as a result of its stylized story arcs character back stories and star performances. It's also quite romantic at times and is not without its comedic moments. For what is essentially a 'popcorn action flick' with little room for excess it does make a solid  effective effort to infuse a sexyromanticcomedic aspect which it pulls off quite well.This is by no means what I would consider a great film but it is just a crap ton of fun and I loved just about everything about it. It's solidly made and quickly paced despite its 2.25 hour run time and it is often incredibly entertaining. There's really very little not to like here in all honesty. If you're looking for a high octane action caper with a decent enough amount of substance behind it you might want to check this movie out pretty soon.So from a reasonable and realistic prospective this film should probably rate at about 7 out of 10 stars or so overall. But I liked this flick way better than that so I'm bumping it up to 8 out of 10 stars. Totally Recommended!".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review The Thieves";
	schema:reviewBody "The Thieves may look like Ocean's Eleven from the onset with its star studded ensemble cast from South Korea and Hong Kong combining forces for the most parts in what would be a casino and jewel caper. But instead of having one primary heist as the central focus for all the characters The Thieves present a whole lot more used to introduce the different team's capabilities and providing plenty of twists and turns as the story progressed. In short it was a real treat and a wild ride to have the usual plot developments of the genre with the betrayals and conflicting motivations all clashing together and delivered with pin point perfection.In the South Korean camp there's Lee JungJae as Popie defacto leader who had assembled his team consisting of slinky cat burglar Yenicall Jeon JiHyun veteran and linguist Chewingum Kim HaeSuk and cable operator Zampano Kim SooHyun to fleece a rich curator. They get contacted by Macao Park Kim YunSeok one time expartner of Popie who had dangled an opportunity for a casino and jewel raid and for the job Popie brings along Pepsee Kim HyeSoo recently out on parole much to Macao Park's displeasure. The complex job also requires the team work with the Hong Kong camp whom Macao contacted for assistance which means an expanded motley crew comprising of leader Chen Simon Yam safecracker Julie Angelica Lee and regular goons in Andrew Oh DaiSu and Johnny Kwok Cheung Tsang. But there's enough to go around since the plan is to rob a jewel in the premises of a casino in Macau then sell it back to its original owner the mysterious Wei Hong Ki GukSeo.The story by Choi DongHun and Lee GiCheol is kept extremely tight despite the myriad of characters involved with director Choi expertly cutting through characters and their respective story arcs with flashbacks used to introduce each and every one of them coupled with surprises that throw up individual character motivations. This adds an extra spice to the proceedings because like a poker game we are the only ones who had a sneak peek into their respective roles and what their intent is from the get go with an expectation that things aren't always what they seem. We're lulled into complacency that we know it all until another surprise gets thrown up to knock us off our balance. And doing so without cheating  which involves randomly or forcefully including unbelievable or illogical moments  was something of a feat.Which is pretty amazing because the pace of the narrative is never let down interspersing adrenaline pumping moments with quieter scenes and the usual heist film montage expectation where the Plan gets played out as the team embarks on their surveillance and preparation work before the real thing. And that only covers less than half the film with the second half trading characters for more stunt work and action and given that it's a Korean film after all had its focus shifted back to the Korean actors. The way that characters come go and the narrative bringing up sub plots work wonderfully well especially in setting up what were to follow from surprising moments.But in a cinematic world where there is no honour amongst thieves a romance also got thrown in to shake things up a little especially when emotions play a key role in the building of various alliances and plans that each individual sets in motion in pursuing their self interests. It plays with what you know and have established feeding you with new facts that would make you change your opinion about someone or some situation and then decide who you would root for in this bunch of ten skilled professionals. They slag each other when there's opportunity to backstab and form new partnerships some even quite moving especially when you know that Trust amongst the players is really a rare commodity.No effort got spared in designing the action and heist sequences in the movie making it a delight to watch since things are kept relatively fresh. Tom Cruise's building climbing escapade is well documented in MI Ghost Protocol and while they aren't scaling the highest building in the world here the film more than made up for it in the frequency number of people involved and at a much faster pace thanks to technology being unavailable other than a strong cable a threaded indication and lots of guts.It's no surprise that this film has so far been South Korea's box office champion given the slick execution of its action and an all round good story involving boring cops and sexysuave robbers. The handling of the languages here  Cantonese and Korean  in the way the characters interact is a definite draw as something that was handled close to perfection because in the real world accents will come to play and this one had attention to detail.".

	schema:reviewBody "The incorporation of 4 women three very pretty one would have been very pretty twenty years ago does give this flick considerable added appeal. The resemblance to Ocean's series however is limited. While both involve robbing a casino the complexity of the job here is child's play compared with George Clooney's schemes. On the other hand this one strives on relationships between the various people in the gang present and past  betrayals romances policy undercover doublecrosses. The main stage is Korea while the action takes place is Macau with planning and aftermath scenes in Hong Kong.I shall make no attempt to deconstruct the plot and subplots the events the roles apparent and real. What follows is only an attempt to briefly outline the lineup hopefully spoilerfree.The guiding spirit of the project is Macao Park Kim Yunseok who brings together 9 people 4 from Hong Kong and 5 from Korea to help him steal a 20millionUSdollar diamond currently kept at a casino in Macau. The idea is to fend the spoil to connoisseurs in the Southeast Asia. Among the potential buyers is the owner of the jewel himself a powerful kingpin so mysterious that only two members of the gang claim to have seen him.The Hong Kong group of 4 is much simpler comprising leader Chen Simon Yam safecracking expert Julie Angelica Lee and two gunmen Andrew and Johnny. Julie has learned her trade from her father reminding you of Charlize Theron in the new Italian Job. Andrew is the designated clown in the group. The only thing special about Johnny is that he is played by Derek Tsang Eric Tsang's son.The Korean group of 5 has a much more complex history of relationships. The movie actually opens with job lead by Popeye Lee Jungjae who worked with Marco a few years ago. His present 3 team members however do not know Macao except by reputation. Gianna Jun sassy as ever and sexier than usual plays a sort of spider woman Yenicall. Chewingum is a middleaged woman veteran but bottleaddicted. Zampano is a young pretty boy fierce in combat. Together with Popeye involved in the aforementioned job with Macao a few years ago is beautiful Pepsi Kim Hyesoo just released from a jail term for her involvement in the job while Macao and Popeye were not caught. While on the surface the trio act as if they have forgotten and forgiven not sure who should forgive whom at this point the ominous undercurrent is stirred up by intermittent flashbacks.It is not difficult to follow the characters and their multidimension interactions are interesting. The good action sequences including a couple of showy set pieces make up for the lacking in subtleties. The twohourplus screen time will pass unnoticed enjoyably.".

I wasn't surprised to find out it was one of the highest grossing films at the Korean box office  this KoreanChinese production is an international blockbuster designed for mass global appeal. The Thieves is a heist action comedy about two teams of professional thieves teaming up for a heist with a surefire success rate but only if each team members could avoid their personal agendas getting in the way ... and that's all you need to know about the film.The movie's biggest success is that it proves that you can have an ensemble cast with no less than 10 principal characters and still make each one of them unique and memorable. By the end of the movie I know each character's personality motivation and quirks. To top it off it has an intelligent script with lots of twists and turns always keeping you guessing. Oh and the setpieces! The final action scene is one of the most entertaining setpieces I've ever seen involving complex choreography wirework and amazing stunts.So yeah do whatever you can to see it you owe that to yourself as this is the kind of movie that Hollywood should be making and isn't. Director Choi DongHoon crafts this masterful heist action comedy with such an assured hand that keeps you entertained and engaged throughout. Also actress Jun JiHyun My Sassy Girl My Love From The Star is dropdead gorgeous and absolutely magnetic on screen. She steals almost every scene she's in and is worth the price of admission alone.".

	schema:reviewBody "The purported selling point here is so lazy and easy it's slutty the most anticipated starstudded action blockbuster 2012! Unless The Thieves intends to pay homage to The Avengers this year's only rightful owner to that headline we can't verify the credibility of that audacious claim. Granted the movie's Alist ensemble of the most bankable stars from around the region places it in a perfect position to sell itself to the usual fandom but I'm usually sceptical of such an approach to filmmaking. The good news? The Thieves is everything it pledges to be in marketing and message  epic smart funny and well shot. The bad news? It's not quite everything it needs to be.Hardened robber Macao Park wants to steal a 20 million diamond from a casino in Macau. In order to pull off the perfect heist he enlists the services of Korean and Chinese thieves. What looks to be a smooth heist suddenly shatters into a botched job as each thief begins to reveal their true motives and lots of betrayals and grudges surface before any thief can get to the diamond. The real winner here is Macao Park who has deliberately assembled this doublecrossing team of thieves so that he can escape with the diamond. Unfortunately trouble catches up to him before he can safely pocket the prize. Each thief must now fight to survive and find the diamond before time runs out.Let's face it this is the sort of heist movie that can only look good with a greedy scale even if it's with one that's only initially superficial. Director Choi Donghoon doesn't scrimp here getting stars from Korea Hong Kong and Malaysia and wrangling with a multilingual dialogue that speaks Korean Mandarin Japanese and English. It makes for an amusing preamble that sees our group of thieves engage in almost endless banter effectively using the barriers of language to allow one party to criticize the other without the other actually realising it. The thieves eventually manage to pull their thinking caps together navigating through the complex security at the casino with an equally cartoonish verve. So far so good right?That question is important because the movie totally loses control once it hits the second half. I'll admit upfront that the movie is very smart  or at least its multitude of subplots is. But the fundamental problem with The Thieves is that it has well over a dozen major characters competing for screen time. I can't stress enough how a burgeoning character count is to the detriment of a movie's quality. With so many personal agendas  betrayals  grudges on offer The Thieves struggles to tie all its subplots into a concise clear and easily comprehensible script instead allowing them to dart uncontrollably in all directions. It's incredibly labourious to keep track of who's doing what or even which diamond is real. Above all else The Thieves would have worked better as a TV serial condensed into movie length it wears out any form of sanity too quickly.That's not to say The Thieves isn't without any more charms. The movie is a stacked deck of balletically choreographed action scenes that become increasingly daring and we dare say reckless as it progresses. Characters are allowed to fight in places that don't traditionally grace the screen for action scenes including an elevator shaft and the surface of a building. There's an action scene which in the perfect storm of horrible coincidence is virtually the same as Tom Cruise's vertiginous adventure on the surface of Dubai's Burj Khalifa tower in last year's Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol. The only thing that's better than this action segment is the relentless pace at which the movie pumps out gunfire.Watching The Thieves is like flirting with James Bond. You get a curious mix of charisma and danger and you don't know whether you should stay or leave the charisma is appealing but the danger is offputting. The Thieves is far from perfection but if you're willing to overlook the messy second half and indulge in the amusement and exhilaration of the package then this socalled most anticipated starstudded action blockbuster 2012 is worth a visit to the cinema.".

The plot is extremely clever and witty and keeps moving and taking unexpected twists and turns right up until the very end. The acting and cinematography are top notch and when it's over you can't believe that more than 2 hours have passed with subtitles at that. Even if I wanted to toss in spoilers it would be difficult because the plot is so involved and only comes together in pieces as the movie progresses. Returning to my opening this flick makes the best possible case that the Ocean's franchise should be shuttered since this was so much better and likely cost much less in total than what was lost to the talent alone in those tepid vacuous American productions.

The story is about stealing a diamond in a casino. Director Choi said he wanted to make a film that has action and a love story. It contains complicated love story and dynamic action. The film is set in Korea and Hongkong.On the plus side the movie includes lots of funny scenes similar to a comedy movie. Also the actor whose name is Dalsu Oh who specializes in playing funny characters makes us not be bored while we are watching the movie.On the other hand the plot has too many reversals that surprises. We don't know the conclusion until the movie is finished. As well If you were Chinese or Japanese the movie would be more fun because they speak both of them in different parts of the movie. And despite the humor there is enough action that will keep you on the edge of your seat.All in all it is fun but this movie is too much like the other heist movies.".

The story is about stealing a diamond in a casino. Director Choi said he wanted to make a film that has action and a love story. It contains complicated love story and dynamic action. The film is set in Korea and Hongkong.On the plus side the movie includes lots of funny scenes similar to a comedy movie. Also the actor whose name is Dalsu Oh who specializes in playing funny characters makes us not be bored while we are watching the movie.On the other hand the plot has too many reversals that surprises. We don't know the conclusion until the movie is finished. As well If you were Chinese or Japanese the movie would be more fun because they speak both of them in different parts of the movie. And despite the humor there is enough action that will keep you on the edge of your seat.All in all it is fun but this movie is too much like the other heist movies.";

	schema:headline " Move Thee Reviews A Love Letter to Oneself";
	schema:reviewBody "Last year witnessed a huge success of a Taiwanese movie You Are the Apple of My Eye at the box office. If you feel like a Korean female version don't miss Sunny a hilarious but sometimes poignant comingofage story about middle age crisis and the ups and downs experienced during adolescence for example puppy love friendship family bullying dreams etc.Sunny is a love letter to oneself which reminds me of Rene Liu's song . There are at least two scenes which play upon the audience's heartstrings. First the teenage girls talk to their future selves about their dreams in front of a video camera which cruelly reminds NaMi in the present of the wreckage of their dreams destroyed by reality. Second NaMi puts a consoling arm around her teenage self around her shoulders which symbolically implies her letting go. Thanks to the right pacing and skillful editing interweaving the present with the past the reality with the illusion they are definitely two of the most touching scenes of the year. After watching the movie you won't help asking yourself if you have forgotten about your dreams.The songs used add a sense of nostalgia to the movie. The most powerful one is Reality by Richard Sanderson. Please note the slightly different uses of the song in several scenes throughout the movie. Thanks to this romantic song the scenes echo with one another highlighting the protagonist's unrequited love for the boy her piercing sadness when she sees the boy using the same strategy to impress her female friend as well as her regret about not having given him the portrait and told him how she feels. For your information the scenes in which the boy stealthily helps the girls wear his headphones playing Reality are indeed a tribute to Claude Pinoteau's La boum a movie released in 1980 about the first love experiences of a teenage girl.The movie which runs two hours plus is slightly too long despite the director's understandable attempt to develop a large number of characters. As for the dancing scene at the end of the movie albeit slightly overlong it is necessary as it shows their genuine bond of friendship after 25 years since graduation. Also the ending seems contrived and sugary whereas the minor flaws previously mentioned can be offset by its charismatic cast well developed characters and the nostalgic setting.There is a trace of irony when the protagonist's mother grumbles about the clichd Korean soap operas twice. Nevertheless the director also reminds us that life is like a film and it is not uncommon that people around us can be struck down by cancer anytime. Being strongly reminiscent of our bittersweet and silly memories during adolescence Sunny reminds us to live life to the full so as not to have regrets.".

	schema:reviewBody "I knew that this kind of movie with people reminiscing about the old days and the deep meaning of friendship if well carried out be a big hit. So it was with Sunny. My friends saw it first and told me how much it got them to thinking of our own school days and how much they missed being together.This movie made me tear up all the way through and really reminded me of my own special friends who I can't see very often now being far away from home and also my school days. We used to run around and dance like the characters of Sunny and laugh louder than we can now. In those days I think the value of friendship was so different since we spent so much time together my relationship with friends were mostly all that mattered. Now as we grow older we might believe that friendship is getting deeper as much as the years gone by but with our own separate careers and busy lives we have to but understand how we are growing distant from each other and we must learn to be adults and just accept that. Most importantly I think this movie teaches us the way to be a friend. What it means to be a true friend something that is too easily forgotten nowadays.It is true that it's hard to keep up with each other during stressful and busy times especially when we are all at different levels and stages in life facing different problems could be financial business family etc issues things that we could not imagine during our school days but as with one of the sayings in the movie we should keep an eye on our friends at all times. If they need help we should give it to them till they become alright. Because if we don't who can? That is the privilege of being a friend.This movie is definitely a mustsee. I want my mum to see it too but I'm afraid she will feel sad more so than me and I can also imagine that when my other friends see this they will probably be reminded of the same things that I was reminded of. It was just such a beautifully made film.".

What I mean is that the ideal Korean girl is quiet innocent and practices proper etiquette at ALL times. But the girls in Sunny are anything BUT those things. Yes it's true that the movie may not have an overarching thesis but this isn't that kind of film. This is a movie that is absolutely in love with it's story and characters where the majority of the film is spent building this friendship and putting that friendship through trials. It may not have the noir pessimistic tone of most popular Korean films but it's nice to have a movie with a happy ending. Because although happy endings may not be gritty or realistic it's definitely worth it when you whether the trials and all the whistledicks that get in the way when you do it with the company of those you care about. And if anything maybe that's what Sunny is about. On a side note the movie is beautifully shot has excellent writing beautiful sets staging acting... it's really just a beautiful movie. Cinephiles eat your heart out. I daresay it's kind of like the Breakfast Club of Korea in the sense of all that youthful angst. It's just a piece of fun cinema that really resonates with that heart warminggoo".

Brothers had a more organized crime tilt Sunny is more sentimental. Brothers was good Sunny is great.But while I don't usually go for the sentimental flix this one did it right somehow.

	schema:reviewBody "This was a decent movie but after I finished watching it. I still wondered why this movie was such a big hit in South Korea. The movie is basically about the bonding of a female High School gang type of group. And the story switches back and forth between when they were High School students to when they are adults. The bonding elements weren't done all that great but the nostalgic feel for some audiences might have made this movie a big hit. Overall the story itself didn't immerse me in this but the bonding elements for some audiences might be enjoyable. The humor in this wasn't even clever or well crafted. Personally I didn't really enjoy this movie all that much and the main thing that kept me watching was Kang SoRa to be honest. I asked few Korean girls who saw this and most of them seemed to have enjoyed it mainly because of the group of girls working as a team and because of the friendship that was built. I just personally didn't think this movie was well crafted with those elements.5.910".

Of course having Isabelle Huppert as the star doesn't hurt.Huppert embodies three different women named Ann in three separate short stories. It all takes place in the sleepy beach town of Mohang. The supporting characters are mostly the same. But the circumstances change sometimes only slightly. English is mostly spoken. In the first story Ann is a French director staying a couple days with a Korean director friend and his pregnant wife.In the second story Ann wife of a businessman in Seoul escapes to the beach town to have a tryst with as wellknown Korean director.In the third story Ann is taken to Mohang by her Korean professor woman friend to help her get over her husband leaving her for another woman a Korean!Other than the backstories not a whole lot happens in terms of plot. But the scenes unfold naturally and with tremendous grace that they are almost painful to watch because the subtleties are just so right on. There's one scene in the final story when Ann her professor friend the man and his pregnant wife are dining alfresco drinking soju and eating bbq. The man is obviously very curious about this white horse. He sees that Ann can enjoy soju so he pours her more but neglects the professor friend. And worse than that he only clinks glasses with Ann. Both the professor and the wife notice this without revealing their ire. The moment is unbearably tense. Hong and Huppert earnestly present three slices of what it means to be a foreigner that you don't need to be Korean French or American to feel that weight.".

The film advances the theme that innocent or friendly interactions between foreigners can often be misinterpreted as sexual advances. The film has a strange improvisational and almost surreal tone yet cleverly manages to convey the feelings of strangeness that a woman alone might experience as a foreigner in another country.

In typical style for the filmmaker he repeats scenes dialogue characters and locations but this time there is a plot point that elevates the repetition  in actuality this is a film about a film and we see the scenes acted out as the female filmmaker character puts her self into her work.Overall it is a good film but as I mentioned before I was disappointed simply because his techniques are beginning to become a little tiresome.".

	schema:reviewBody "Unwittingly it is my very first film from the universally acclaimed South Korean auteur Sangsoo Hong by virtue of Isabelle Huppert. But out of my heart the film is frustratingly bland and ineptly flippant. All the setting is exclusively in a remote beach and a family hotel near sea side. After an informal conversation between a pair of mother and daughter Park Soo Yoon and Wonju Jeong about their familial dispute. Then Wonju starts to write three short stories for her script each centers a French woman named Anne Huppert respectively as a female director an adulteress and a divorce conveniently dressed in blue red and green and Wonju becomes the hotelier. In each scenario Anne is pursued by Korean men for the blue Anne her friend Jongsoo Hyo expresses his beyondfriend affection to her despite he is with his pregnant wife Kumhee Moon for the red Anne she is on a tryst with the film director Munsoo Mun who is late for their rendezvous subsequently she has illusions of whether or not Munsoo will ever arrive for the green Anne who is accompanied by her friend Park Soo out of her wedlock because her husband deserts her for a Korean woman she is seeking help from a monk Youngoak but also seduced by the lecherous Jongsoo. Yet in each episode Anne encounters an amiable lifeguard Yu and looks for a small lighthouse they almost have the same dialog typically instigated between a foreign tourist and a local citizen which is pleasant to watch for the first time but a third time is not a charm. In one hand one can greatly appreciate the sharpwitted execution of the inyourface hostility hidden beneath the ostensible amicability thanks to the language barrier on the other hand most of the time the film entraps itself into its own dilemmatic loop only skirts along the surface of the intercultural clash. Huppert is criminally underused here maybe she also took the advantage for a holiday here the Korean cast is naturalistic at its best Sangsoo Hong never give anything too demanding to perform the film is a freewheeling prose it might fare better if it is projected as a screen background with its unobtrusive visual tenderness and lilted but minimal conversations while you can sip your afternoon tea with minicookies but it you want to carefully scrutinize its contents and its subtext with your full attention it is an embarrassingly dreary one and it seems Sangsoo Hong himself did adopt a devilmaycare attitude long since its inception.".

In each scenario Anne is pursued by Korean men for the blue Anne her friend Jongsoo Hyo expresses his beyondfriend affection to her despite he is with his pregnant wife Kumhee Moon for the red Anne she is on a tryst with the film director Munsoo Mun who is late for their rendezvous subsequently she has illusions of whether or not Munsoo will ever arrive for the green Anne who is accompanied by her friend Park Soo out of her wedlock because her husband deserts her for a Korean woman she is seeking help from a monk Youngoak but also seduced by the lecherous Jongsoo. Yet in each episode Anne encounters an amiable lifeguard Yu and looks for a small lighthouse they almost have the same dialog typically instigated between a foreign tourist and a local citizen which is pleasant to watch for the first time but a third time is not a charm. In one hand one can greatly appreciate the sharpwitted execution of the inyourface hostility hidden beneath the ostensible amicability thanks to the language barrier on the other hand most of the time the film entraps itself into its own dilemmatic loop only skirts along the surface of the intercultural clash. Huppert is criminally underused here maybe she also took the advantage for a holiday here the Korean cast is naturalistic at its best Sangsoo Hong never give anything too demanding to perform the film is a freewheeling prose it might fare better if it is projected as a screen background with its unobtrusive visual tenderness and lilted but minimal conversations while you can sip your afternoon tea with minicookies but it you want to carefully scrutinize its contents and its subtext with your full attention it is an embarrassingly dreary one and it seems Sangsoo Hong himself did adopt a devilmaycare attitude long since its inception.";

I have to say that the acting and direction seemed at times quite amateur. It left me with a feeling of dissatisfaction. As someone said the director is interested in a minimalistic approach to conveying a story and I imagine that he succeeded. It felt more like a rough sketch than a film. In fact it felt to me like 3 short films. Nevertheless there was something intangible in the characters something allusive. Again the minimalism lends itself to an ambiguity. Personally I like ambiguity to a degree but this film was more like a line drawing than a painting. The opening in fact sets the tone for the film. The music that the director chooses the credits and the acting all give you that feeling that you are not watching real human beings fleshed out but character studies.".

Dan has one other serious problem the shock has left him with amnesia. He tries to put his life back together with the help of his wife but nothing seems real. In trying to piece together his former existence he tracks down all types of hunches and leads that take him nowhere. Then one day he comes across a strange bill for 7000 from a pet shop.

Gus tells him all kinds of strange happenings including a story about his wife's lover. He also learns that his business partner's wife Jenny Scott Joanne Whalley is much closer to him than he wants her to be. As Gus and Dan search for clues they find more than either one bargained for. The ending is a grabber. The viewer won't be disappointed.Director Wolfgang Petersen of Das Boot fame directs with a flair for action and suspense. There is a wild car chase toward the end of the movie that really delivers the goods. Though Petersen's film which he wrote based on a novel may not exactly be film noir it shares several elements in common with that genre including two femme fatales. There is also symbolic use of natural forces such as the pounding of the waves against the shore to enhance portions of the script which may or may not have been inspired by the 1942 film noir picture Street of Chance.All the acting is above average but the standout performance is by Bob Hoskins as the PI who loves animals. There are also bits of humor from a pet shop employee Sadie Jedda Jones over the phone when called asking for Gus.".

Seeing that it was directed by Wolfgang Petersen I became a little curious but didn't really plan on watching it. Well that thought went out the window when the movie opened with a bang. Husband and wife Dan and Judith are involved in a devastating car crash. But despite all odds both survive however the husband played by Tom Berenger is in critical condition and is left with no memory of who he is or what happened. His seemly loving wife Greta Scacchi does everything she can to help him readjust after getting out of the hospital but alas something just doesn't seem right. He slowly begins to realize that everything may not have been as rosy as his wife would have him believe and things get even more interesting when he learns that he paid for services by a street wise private detective named Gus played by Bob Hoskins.Shattered is one of those unassuming movies that going in you're not expecting to find anything too shocking or surprising and that's where you'd be wrong. I've seen a lot of thrillers and mysteries so much so that eight out ten times I can probably tell you what the ending will be. However I got to tell you the twist at the end of this movie is so well done and so shocking that I didn't see it coming for a million miles and believe me that's saying something. The movie also does a good job drawing you the viewer deeper and deeper into the movie without even realizing it with the direction of Petersen the story and the actors Tom Berenger does an excellent job in his role as does Greta Scacchi. However my favorite actor out of this is probably Bob Hoskins since he's able to provide a little bit of comedy and heart to his role. If you're one who's looking for a lost gem of a film or is just looking for a good surprise at the end then I highly highly recommend Shattered. You won't regret it!".

	schema:headline " Decent But Dated Escapist Flick with Quite a Twist at the End";
	schema:reviewBody "The feel of this film rings of a late 1970's early 1980's actiondrama TV show like Hart to Hart Charlie's Angels or even Dallas particularly because of the location shots and the music. The scenes alternate between milliondollar mansions ritzy hotels billiondollar corporations and rural locales. And the lush strings always emerge when the characters are driving through some mountainous areas. I kept thinking that Jaclyn Smith would turn up at any moment. The opening premise is quite a stretch Tom Berenger as Dan Merrick survives after having plunged about 6000 feet off the road in his car. It's a miracle that his legs didn't end up in the glove compartment. Despite being more or less still intact Merrick's face has been crushed into hamburger and he can't remember who he is or what happened to him after he awakens from a coma. His wife Judith Greta Scacchi is only a little scratched up after the ordeal. She nurses him back to health and tries to help put the puzzle pieces back into his shattered memory.He finds out he's a rich commercial real estate developer with a house with its own zip code. His office at the TransAmerica building in San Francisco is bigger than the average person's apartment. And he has a beautiful secretary who must have just finished a stint as a cover model for Vogue. And his colleague is the kind of guy who uses the old two shooter gesture while saying We'll do lunch. That would be a nightmare!But other pieces do not come together so easily like why before the accident did he hire a private investigator Bob Hoskins who fronts as a pet store owner? And why did this guy's invoice end up at the development company? At one point he thought he had bought 7000 worth of pets! With that kind of money he could have gotten the equivalent of Magnum PI.The film becomes a kind of noir mystery in which Merrick tries to put the pieces of his life back into perspective all the while trying to figure who he can trust. Although some of the writing and circumstances were a little hard to swallow the movie sort of gets better as it goes along. And a great performance by Berenger holds the story together more or less. At every moment despite its shortcomings you want to find out what happens next. And a dynamite ending that is worth the wait and the price of admission 5 for the DVD at Fry's.".

As the story progresses numerous clues to the puzzle are provided but it's always unclear which ones are reliable and which are intentionally misleading. Similarly the natures of the various characters who provide these clues are also uncertain.Dan Merrick Tom Berenger and his wife Judith Greta Scacchi are driving home from a New Year's Eve party when their car suddenly leaves the road and plunges down a steep embankment. Judith is thrown clear and only incurs superficial injuries. Dan on the other hand is trapped in the wreckage and subsequently spends a considerable amount of time in a coma before undergoing extensive plastic surgery on his disfigured face.As a consequence of the accident Dan suffers from selective amnesia and flashbacks in which he sees shattered glass huge waves and a gun. He's also unable to remember any information about his personal life and during his recuperation Judith dedicates herself to his care and tries to help him by sharing recollections about their life together and showing him photographs.Dan's a wealthy property developer and is surprised when his business partner Jeb Scott Corbin Bernsen mentions that before the accident Dan and Judith's marriage was on the rocks. Jeb's wife Jenny Joanne WhalleyKilmer tells him that he and she were lovers and he also discovers photographs of Judith in bed with another man.Dan finds a receipt for a payment he'd previously made to a pet shop and on visiting the premises discovers that the proprietor Gus Klein Bob Hoskins is also a parttime private detective who he'd paid to follow Judith. Klein had discovered that she was having an affair with a man called Jack Stanton Scott Getlin and so when Dan hears that Judith has received a telephone call from Stanton and decides to follow her the events that follow ultimately lead to a shocking discovery.Shattered is a stylish movie in which deception murder and treachery feature strongly and numerous unexpected plot developments keep the action intriguing and tense. The fact that the audience discovers the clues at the same time as Dan creates a great deal of empathy for his predicament and a clear understanding of the confusion and frustration that he experiences.This movie is graced by consistently solid performances but Tom Berenger and Bob Hoskins stand out. Berenger does well in conveying his character's confusion and helplessness and Hoskins is a powerful and entertaining presence in every scene in which he appears.".

	schema:headline " Hitchcockian web woven with ludicrous plot.";
	schema:reviewBody "Wolfgang Petersen has done some good thrillers in the past and has deep respect for classical directors such as Hitchcock so what better opportunity than to create his own thriller the way the Master of Suspense would have if he were alive. He assembles a good cast among them Tom Berenger Bob Hoskins in an enjoyable role and Greta Scacchi and creates a story a la Vertigo. What could go wrong? With movies like this one glitch in the plot could topple the whole film off the bell tower pardon the Vertigo pun and this one does just that. A man trying to remember what occurred in his personal life after surviving a tragic car wreck can be enthralling and at many times this picture is indeed mindnumbing but threequarters into the story you feel as if you have been cheated. Plausibility is a real concern in this thriller but that's not to say there are not good elements within this confusion. Wolfgang Petersen shows a real expertise for framing his ludicrous story and I believe Hitch would have been pleased with how Petersen motivates the camera here. Berenger does an okay job as the suffering crash victim but it is Hoskins that really impresses as the pet store ownerprivate investigator who helps Berenger discover who he really was. Shattered is a nicely lensed film with a good dose of suspense surrounding it but for a payoff I believe Hitchcock could have shown the filmmakers a thing or two about playing it straight with a good ending. Rating Two stars and a half.".

This is completely an edge of seat suspense thriller. Story is full of twists and very entertaining. I am in no position to discuss direction as director is considered authority in his field.Many people will criticize that story in unrealistic and this thing is not possible in real world then I say to them if you want reality look around you.

This is completely an edge of seat suspense thriller. Story is full of twists and very entertaining. I am in no position to discuss direction as director is considered authority in his field.Many people will criticize that story in unrealistic and this thing is not possible in real world then I say to them if you want reality look around you.

It's well directed moves quickly has a great scene that makes good use of the song Nights in White Satin and is never dull. The acting isn't badBerenger was never a great actor but he pulls this role off Scacchi is very good until the end and Hoskins is just great and brings a welcome note of humor to the film. Corbin Bensen and Joanne WhalleyKilmer are wasted however. This all works fineuntil the final plot twist. At first it seems like a real cool twist...but then you think about it. It's so ridiculously implausible that it derails the entire movie. I had more than a few questions about it but the movie leaves then hanging. There is NO way this would have worked. As one character says I knew it was crazy. Indeed. Still the film is good until that part and worth watching for the first two sections. For that alone I give this an 8.".

Apparently from low box office figures it didn't stay around long in early release.However I don't share the enthusiasm for this flick that a number of others here do. I agree with Ebert's view from another site that it was inconceivably implausible. These kinds of noir stories usually stretch credibility at some point but not to the unending extent this one did. I was interrupted a couple of times so I don't know whether I missed some point as to whether the lead was a true doppelganger for the corpse found towards the end or whether some sort of reconstructive surgery had been covered or implied in one of the brief parts I missed  but it really wouldn't matter anyway.Corbin Bernsen had so little to do thought he might be a red herring in the beginning and I guess Berenger needed a partner so it wouldn't look like his business had lapsed during his recovery.The ending which for me was more corny than shocking was a little too pat. I suppose there had to be another accident to resolve things but why do these situations always have people driving like a batoutofhell on slick twolane curvy roadways at the edge of cliffs with guardrails which seem to be made of balsa wood?But my greatest complaint is that the two leads  neither of whose normal acting styles could be termed animated in their previous efforts  looked like they might be on an excess of downers throughout the filming. Berenger often has played the aw shucks good guy and even roles where he's beaten the hell out of every bad guy in sight with a lowerkey understated style.

The reason it seems that so many people are turned off by the movie is that it not only went the full nine yards to tell it's mysterysuspense story with an out of the blue surprise ending but it goes the entire length of the football field telling it.Tom Berenger is made to sleepwalk through his role as Dan Merrick because he's not only been left in the dark like the movie audience after his near fatal car crash that not only smashed his face and body but took away his memory of everything in his life up until that accident. Dan surviving a New Years car accident with his wife Judith Greta Scacchi that almost killed him tries to put his life back together after leaving the hospital but feels that there are things about what happened to him before the accident that his wife is keeping from him. Things just don't seem right and Dan is confused about himself and the people that he knew before he lost his memory and senses that his wife is keeping the truth from him for reasons known only to herself. With the possible exception of his wife's friend Jenny Joanne Whalley who seems to know the truth about Dan just about everyone is kept in the dark until the very end of the movie. Even though Shattered stretches creditability to it's limits it does pack quite a wallop when it hits you and the movie itself does have a very good story up to the startling point of impact in it's heart thumping final sequence.Dan struggling to find out the truth about himself one day finds in his home a proofroll of photoprint positives of his wife and another man having an affair which greatly upsets him. Checking in his day book at his office where he works as an architect he come across a note that he wrote about a week before his accident listing a 7000.00 payment to a Mr.Gus Kline Bob Hoskins. Looking deeper into this transaction and checking out who Gus Kline is Dan finds out that Mr. Kline runs a pet store in the city San Francisco.Dan is left to wonder what kind of pet could have cost him 7000.00! An elephant?At the pet store Gus immediately recognizes Dan and calls him aside to tell him that he's also a private investigator who he hired just before his accident and it was him who took the photos of his wife having an affair with the man on those prints and tells Dan that the man's name is Jack Stanton Scott Getlin. After that the movie Shattered goes into something like the Twilight Zone where the story about Dan and his wife Judith and the mysterious Jack Stanton goes into overdrive and later turns outright deadly. The movie builds up to it's incredible and shocking conclusion inside a deserted ship at the local marina where the secret that was hidden from the audience as well as both Dan and Gus surfaced. Very good but somewhat farfetched story that despite its ending which wasn't bad at all you have to admire for the lengths it went to captivate and surprise it's audience. Tom Berenger looked confused throughout the movie where at the same time you could sense by his acting the bits and pieces coming into place about his life before the accident. It was the jolt at the marina that shocked him back to the real world the world before his mind went blank like a lighting bolt out of the blue.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have no complaints about Shattered. None. My first viewing happened by accident while staying at a hotel in Indiana with my parents. However we came in half way through the movie so I didn't have a clue as the what was going on. A couple of years later I became VERY interested in Tom Berenger and just HAD to see everything he'd ever done.I waited and waited for Shattered to come out of DVD so I could get it from Netflix and then one day there it was. I immediately got it and then while I was in Florida I found it to buy on DVD needless to say I waisted no time in grabbing it before it was gone.Spoliers might be ahead. Shattered is the twisted tale of Dan Merrik Tom Berenger a handsome successful business man with a beautiful wife Judith Greta Scacchi. The story begins as Dan and Judith have a horrifying car crash on New Years Eve. Dan's face is left totally unrecognizable while Judith is left with barely a scratch. She didn't even sprain her ankle. says a character I'll get to later on.

	onyx:emotionText "I have no complaints about Shattered. None. My first viewing happened by accident while staying at a hotel in Indiana with my parents. However we came in half way through the movie so I didn't have a clue as the what was going on. A couple of years later I became VERY interested in Tom Berenger and just HAD to see everything he'd ever done.I waited and waited for Shattered to come out of DVD so I could get it from Netflix and then one day there it was. I immediately got it and then while I was in Florida I found it to buy on DVD needless to say I waisted no time in grabbing it before it was gone.Spoliers might be ahead. Shattered is the twisted tale of Dan Merrik Tom Berenger a handsome successful business man with a beautiful wife Judith Greta Scacchi. The story begins as Dan and Judith have a horrifying car crash on New Years Eve. Dan's face is left totally unrecognizable while Judith is left with barely a scratch. She didn't even sprain her ankle. says a character I'll get to later on.

	schema:reviewBody "Jumpin' Jack Flash is a very funny comedythriller starring comedienne and current Hollywood Squares star Whoopi Goldberg in the movie she made after her outstanding performance in The Color Purple. This was her first big comedy and she's terrific in it. Goldberg stars as Terry Doolittle a computer operator at a New York bank. At the end of a long day of work she gets an awkward message from a British spy who's in trouble. As a result she gets plunged into a world of international intrigue and danger. Sure the premise of Jumpin' Jack Flash is silly. But it's an entertaining movie thanks to Goldberg's performance. She's the whole show here. One of the best moments in the film is the one when the spy asks her to sing with me and find the key and she listens to the lyrics of the Mick Jagger song Jumpin' Jack Flash so she can find the word or words to crack the spy's code. This scene is a classic. Just get a load of the way Goldberg acts in this scene. It's hilarious. This scene proves that Goldberg is a great comic actress. There's also the scene where after almost getting killed Goldberg confronts a police detective played by Pretty Woman and Runaway Bride director Garry Marshall who oddly enough is the brother of the director of this film former Laverne  Shirley star Penny Marshall making her directorial debut here. Get a load of the foul language displayed by Goldberg in this scene. I was laughing hysterically out loud. There are also action scenes that really aren't necessary but they're exciting and thrilling. And there are good supporting performances by Stephen Collins Carol Kane John Wood Annie Potts Roscoe Lee Browne Jim Belushi Jon Lovitz and the late Phil Hartman. But the real star here is Whoopi. She alone makes Jumpin' Jack Flash worth seeing. And it's far better that Whoopi's next two movies after this Burglar and Fatal Beauty. out of four".

Whoopi Goldberg who was a bit the hot strange spot from Hollywood since her appearance in The color purple did some nice comedies from which this one must be one of the finest. She plays the role of Teresa aka Terry a weirdo who is obsessed by movies and books and during daytime she spend eight hours in a bank behind a computer a must for pcfreaks to see how dated they are!!!. Her hilarious boss Mr James Page Peter Michael Goetz forbids her to chat she obeys till Jumpin Jack Flash knocks. She can't resist the power not to respond and soon she discovers that Jumpin Jack Flash is a CIAagent who is somewhere in East Europe it was still a cold war and he begs him to help. Sooner as Teresa thinks she has become a target from the KGB as well and as you can guess she ends up in dangerous hilarious situations or are you kidnapped any day in a phone booth?. Absolutely do not to try to understand the plot there isn't one and if there should be some it has no meaning...it's just a CIAagent who runs for the KGB that's all but that's not the reason why you should watch this it's just to see a fine comedy that stands for 90 minutes of entertainment.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jumping Jack Flash has come in for some surprisingly negative opinions over the years. A lot of people consider it a black mark on Whoopi Goldberg's career. Although it does suffer from a few flaws its quite watchable it moves at a fair lick and is in no way the turkey its often accused of being. Its nowhere near as bad as Theodore Rex. Now that was a turkey!After making her debut in The Colour Purple Jumping Jack Flash was Whoopi Goldberg's first proper starring role and a chance to flex her muscles as an actress. And she's up to the task. Some of the plot points of JJF don't always ring true but its a testament to Whoopi's charm and magnetism that she turns an occasionally ludicrous adventure into a fairly entertaining comedythriller.Terry Dolittle Whoopi works a computer at a New York bank. Bored of such a humdrum life she finally gets a wakeup call from someone who taps into her computer. Someone called Jumping Jack Flash. Jack is in serious trouble. A British agent trapped in Russia he needs help from Terry. The British Consulate won't acknowledge him and he needs Terry to run errands for him. Everything from rooting out possible exit contacts on the back of frying pans to breaking into the Consulate itself and accessing their computers. All the while the situation gets more and more murkier things go from one dangerous extreme to the next and Terry and Jack's lives are both endangered.Although a lot of people have an astonishing hatred of this film I can't say the same. I think JJF is great fun with a twisty screenplay right out of a Kafka novel. It wouldn't be half as fun without Whoopi Goldberg at the helm but its thanks to her dynamic energy the film's momentum is kept as steady as it is.The film pretty much rests on Whoopi's shoulders. And she does a great job. Delivering the laughs when they're needed but also establishing a genuine fearful feeling when she gets in over her head. I especially liked the scenes of her conversing with Jack Jonathan Pryce. There is real poignancy for Jack's situation because it feels like Terry is the only friend he has.There is quite an exceptional cast too. Granted they tend to get reduced to mere minutes in the spotlight but because there is such a large gallery of famous faces they leave a lasting impression. Look out for the late Phil Hartman Annie Potts from Ghostbusters James Belushi Tracy Ullman and even Carol Kane. One thing that surprised me about JJF is there are quite a few actors from This Is Spinal Tap in the film. So keep your eyes peeled for Michael McKean June Chadwick and Tony Hendra.Penny Marshall made her debut as director here and she does quite a fine job. She does sometimes overplay her hand where the film tips over from genuine suspense to overblown farce. Such as the scenes of Whoopi Goldberg's dress caught in a paper shredder being dragged along the streets of New York in a phone box or wandering into Elizabeth Arden doped up on truth serum but for the most part Marshall knows what she's doing. She's not as successful here as she was in her next film Big her single finest hour but JJF is still a lot of fun.The ending has genuine nerve jangling tension and equal parts pathos. Her near death at the British Consulate is exciting although her escape from a police car is contrived. There's no way Terry wouldn't be handcuffed and I don't know why there wasn't a grille separating the back seats from the front. But the final shootout at the bank is good. And the scene where Terry finally meets Jack is touching too.Jumping Jack Flash sometimes moves in fits and starts but Penny Marshall's direction is assured at most of the right moments. Whoopi Goldberg hits a lot of the right notes and its also a film that was ahead of its time in addressing the EMail system.So give Jumping Jack Flash a chance. If not for the film than at least for the scene where Terry goes through the song for Jack's codekey. Worth the price of admission alone!".

Whoopi Goldberg hits a lot of the right notes and its also a film that was ahead of its time in addressing the EMail system.So give Jumping Jack Flash a chance. If not for the film than at least for the scene where Terry goes through the song for Jack's codekey. Worth the price of admission alone!";

So as well as a comedy there are some thrills thrown in as well.It's well written with some pretty obvious stuff in there but it makes it kind of fun. Whoopi Goldberg puts in a good performance. Today it's fun to watch because the computers are SO out of date and because at one point Whoopi hits about 40 keyboard keys to type the work 'Hi! Just listen to the sound of the keys. Whoopi's a good actress and comedian but she's no typist  at least by the evidence here. And it's good to see Carol Kane and Stephen Collins who both look about 12.There are some fabulous continuity errors as well for anyone looking for them  in the scene in the police station not only does the blanket Whoopi's wearing change places from scene to scene so does her collar.If you want a fun film that won't stretch your brain this is well worth a look. Ingmar Bergman it isn't but it's a nice feel good movie for those times when you just want to sit down and turn your brain off it's great. And if you want to know what computers used to look like and why you practically needed a second mortgage for somewhere to store them look no further.".

Whether you are endeared to this almost cut and paste approach depends largely on if you find appeal in her and her act or not. I do so I'm not troubled that so much of the focus is on just one person for so long.There's the usual 80's stock plot about spies and secret dealings but really that's just a front to see if Goldberg can establish a wacky character and manage to keep the audience interested in following her journey until the end of the film. If that's the sum total of your expectations for this movie then I'd say that all concerned accomplish their task rather well.Roger Ebert complained that her character is a loner who doesn't interact properly with others. In this case there is a definite reason why she was forced into such a narrow pigeonhole  it's so there's little chance that one of her costars may inadvertently steal her thunder. There's no fear of that this is a one woman show throughout but to me she proved that she's got the tools to headline a movie all by herself and still be funny.

	schema:headline " How an unlikely love story acquires a soul";
	schema:reviewBody "The prologue opens with a dishevelled and somewhat stunned looking women later known as Anna Chan a lost soul wandering in a suburban area of a city later known to be Seattle. Then as if suddenly snapped back into her senses she returns to what must be scene of crime and fumbles around a dead man lying on the floor. Police sirens then an abrupt cut to the title on a black screen Late Autumn.Seven years later we see Anna getting a three day pass from prison to attend her mother's funeral with a cell phone by which her whereabouts is monitored. Failure to answer and report will constitute prisonbreaking immediately triggering a manhunt or womanhunt if you wish. On the bus home to Seattle she encounters Hoon a Korean young man who claims to have his wallet stolen and borrows 30 dollars from her to make up for his bus fare. Noticing the reluctance in her compliance he leaves her his watch for custodianship until he pays her back. The rest of the movie is about the development of a subtle relationship between Anna and Hoon.The persona of the two protagonists cannot be more polarized. Hoon is flippant happygolucky but not without charm. This soon all makes sense as it is revealed that his is a male escort a less flattering term would be gigolo. While phone calls Anna gets are from the prison authorities Hoon gets his share of phone calls from a friend warning him that one of his favourite client's husband is furious and coming after him. Anna serving a sentence for killing not specified if it is murder or lesser charge is understandably taciturn and guarding. Hoon seems quite sincere in his attentive and gentle attempt to make friends but to no avail.Upon arrival in Seattle Hoon goes off to meet his client said wife of the angry husband makes himself obviously very welcome receives a handsome fee and even an invitation to elope. Anna is less fortunate finding herself almost like a stranger to her family after 7 years of imprisonment. After some agonizing she decides to spend the time before the funeral in solitude. When Anna and Hoon chance to meet again each with a day ahead with no clear purpose it is where the mesmerizing movie really begins. On an impulse she suggests sex Do you want me? which does not work out as she has been so emotionally damaged in the last 7 years in prison. In good humour he suggests taking this first unsatisfied customer on a relaxing tour of Seattle.One situation in movies always fascinates me  how two complete strangers finally click. My top favourite has always been and still is The bridges of Madison County 1995except for Before SunriseSunset which is beyond being mere top favourite. What Late Autumn offers is ingenious and as already mentioned mesmerizing. The day has gone relaxing enough despite her taciturn irresponsiveness to his considerate attention. Then at dawn in a deserted amusement park something magical happens. At a distance they see a couple purportedly Greek he darkish and she blonde and fair on an animated exchange. He is trying to end their relationship while she implores him to reconsider. In his customary flippant style Hoon starts to dub the conversation in amusement in both voices. The magical moment starts when Anna quite unexpectedly picks up the woman's part. The scene ends with a surreal dance sequence beautifully executed by the distant couple. From this point on there may not appear to have been any apparent change in the relationship between Anna and Hoon the audience sense that somewhere there souls are beginning to find each other.Two ensuing and equally ingenious scenes cement this development. Anna tells her story  an adolescent infatuation an unhappy marriage reentering into her life of the irresponsible man she adored jealous husband and physical abuse and finally killing legal technicalities omitted and imprisonment. While Anna and Hoon have been conversing in English with amply adequate fluency this selfrevelation sequence is in Chinese with Hoon responding in the only two Chinese words he knows  good and bad. Despite that fact that these two words are sometimes used incorrectly almost farcically one somehow gets the feeling that Hoon understands most of what Anna tells him. Or does it really matter? The other scene is a social gathering after the funeral ending in a brawl between Hoon and this irresponsible exboy friend of Anna now happily married. The whole scene is a charade and again at times almost farcical  the reason given by Hoon for his physical attack is that this man has used his fork and didn't even apologize. The more farcical the scene the more poignant is the entirely overblown emotional reaction of both Hoon and Anna standing up for each other.I fear this piece is already approaching IMDb's word limits. There is a lot more to be discovered enjoyed and appreciated in this movie which is filmed in Seattle in the city's usual melancholy rain and mist but not without a break of sunshine that is particularly significant. Music is put to the best use as is complete silence. TANG Wei's superb nuanced performance won her a dozen well deserved awards. HYUN Bin's role is not as easy as it appears. To play a flippant gigolo is not difficult but to play one that convincingly capture the audience empathy requires much work which he delivers almost effortlessly.".

	schema:reviewBody "The film opens with a severely beaten Anna the always beautiful Wang Tei desperately struggling to come to terms with what led to the death of an as of yet unidentified male. Much of the film operates in this fashion providing the viewer with enough of a taste to comprehend what may have happened however rarely definitively illustrating an exact answer allowing the audience's imagination to fill in the blanks. On one hand this has the unique feel of independent cinema and allows viewers much freedom though at the same time can become frustrating considering we the viewers long for completeness to quench our thirst for knowledge.Seven years later in the midst of a prison sentence Anna is given a three day furlough to visit her mother's funeral. On the way to Seattle she bumps into Hoon HyunBin who asks her to lend him money for bus fare and though he promises to pay her back Anna shows little interest. Ms. Tei convincingly plays a woman who has become disillusioned and pessimistic from her time in prison while exhibiting melancholy in a city which has changed since she was last there.By chance she meets Hoon once more who offers to take her around Seattle. Hoon is for lack of a better term a gigolo however his explanation sounds far more advertising though at the same time he seems painfully romantic garnering feelings for some of the women he meets despite being required to maintain his professionalism.On the run from the jealous husband of a woman who fell in love with him two years earlier Hoon is a man whose life has taken a turn for the worse much like Anna's yet continues to maintain optimism and confidence that attracts her to him. Surrounded by judgemental relatives Hoon is the one man who accepts Anna for who she is.The chemistry between the leads is especially great there being a number of equally dramatic and humorous moments to behold. Moreover a number of scenes are very memorable including a moment when Hoon and Anna break into an amusement park alongside another time when Anna discusses some of her past.The multiple locations are brilliantly brought to life by the cinematography which further draws us into the experience while the use of sound and music is just as effective.By the conclusion of the film I was left feeling a little empty for unlike other features that serenade us with fantastical plots of everlasting love director Kim TaeYong never tries to force anything. Instead he creates a feature that feels very genuine right down to the painful reality that not everything is destined to end happily ever after despite our wishful thinking.Half of the film is in English while the other half is subtitled.".

He said how are you doing it's good to see you you still look like a child and squeezes her cheeks. The film then shows Anna shopping buying and putting on a dress earrings makeup. Throughout the movie Tang Wei does not say much except in a few outbursts where her emotions accumulates she did this before in Lust Caution. You think in this scene she want something just a little bit for herself now. This is a movie where if you put in enough empathy you might shift uncomfortably in your chair during a few scenes. I walked away thinking how long will that one kiss or the one promise lasts for her in prison? With her understated and unspoken acting Wei's character appears to be of almost limitless will  and I think she will wait in that cafe for forever. It's a superb script with brilliant surprises that make emotional sense that superb script has. I think it asks stripped of all the superficial necessities and orders that make our lives make sense what happen to us? What would you do if you are Chinese American on a Portland to Seattle bus attending your mother's funeral and need to go back to prison in two days with the persons you loved leaving you in prison bumping into a handsome Korean gigolo who might be the only person in the world that cares about you?".

However quickly got WTF when Anna was let out of jail on socalled compassionate leave WITHOUT an escort OR ankle bracelet not to mention she was in jail for a VIOLENT CRIME. All they gave her was a cell phone to keep track of her which they only called her twice. so that bothered me.why did they get such bad actors for Americans? all of them sounded like English wasn't their first language... that scene at the bumper cars.omg such bad acting... the scene went on WAYY too long and then that random dance that they did?! it was beautiful and how it was edited but it had NO place in that movie and made NO sense what so ever! so they ran and were in some meat shop where it was bothering me that they had left the meat sitting out like that and the doors open?!and then when anna was telling her story to hyunbin he kept saying hao and hwey and was TOTALLY making everything she said unserious and i didn't feel bad for character. everyone in this movie fell flat... that kiss in the end WAS TOO LONG OMG. WTF was that! It was LITERALLY over a minute long kiss scene. i kept looking at my watch waiting for that movie to be over.i could say more but who will read it? anyway. they tried to shove a comedy a drama and an indie art film into one movie and it DID NOT work.".

All they gave her was a cell phone to keep track of her which they only called her twice. so that bothered me.why did they get such bad actors for Americans? all of them sounded like English wasn't their first language... that scene at the bumper cars.omg such bad acting... the scene went on WAYY too long and then that random dance that they did?! it was beautiful and how it was edited but it had NO place in that movie and made NO sense what so ever! so they ran and were in some meat shop where it was bothering me that they had left the meat sitting out like that and the doors open?!and then when anna was telling her story to hyunbin he kept saying hao and hwey and was TOTALLY making everything she said unserious and i didn't feel bad for character. everyone in this movie fell flat... that kiss in the end WAS TOO LONG OMG. WTF was that! It was LITERALLY over a minute long kiss scene. i kept looking at my watch waiting for that movie to be over.i could say more but who will read it? anyway. they tried to shove a comedy a drama and an indie art film into one movie and it DID NOT work.";

In other words when we deem an artwork original it doesn't so much mean that the work is original as it means that we're just not familiar with the works that have had a significant influence on it or we do not remember the precursors for those of us with less than perfect memories . . . what was I saying?The Quiet Family has already had a significant influence on films such as Jaume Balaguer's The Darkness 2002 and it has already been remade by wacky Japanese director Takashi Miike as The Happiness of the Katakuris Katakurike no kfuku 2001. I didn't realize that Happiness of the Katakuris was a remake of this film until I watched Happiness and looked it up on IMDb. I had never heard of this film before. South Korean films do not exactly get a great amount of publicity in the U.S. unfortunately.Unlike Miike's remake which is a very good film in its own right The Quiet Family doesn't have bizarre claymation it's not a musical there aren't singing and dancing zombiecorpses and there isn't some karmic disturbance of an equivalent to Mt. Fuji. This is a much quieter and understated film but it's still a black morbid or macabre comedydrama about a horrific bad situation that just keeps getting worse.The story concerns Taegu Kang who has bought a small hotel unlike Happiness of the Katakuris' much simpler bed  breakfast in a relatively remote hiking area. He moves his familyhis wife son two daughters and his brotherto the hotel where they wait for guests to arrive. No one shows up. When they eventually do get a guest it's a strange solitary older man who ends up committing suicide with his hotel key chain. The man's wallet which seemed to contain a substantial sum of cash is missing. Worried that the authorities will never believe them that it was a suicide especially given their son's troubled past and worried that the situation will create bad publicity for their hotel they decide to bury the body on their property. Other guests begin trickling in but for some reason or another they all meet less than favorable fates. Just how much bad luck will the Kangs have and just how far will they go to surmount it? Even though this is a morbid comedy director Jiwoon Kim employs very deliberate arthouse drama pacing and tonalities. The cinematography is interesting throughout and recurrent motifs include sustained almost motionless shots of daughter Mina Kang Hokyung Go who is implied as an emotional center for the family and indeed she's the only one who remains relatively evenkeeled throughout the bizarre occurrences. There are also many slow tracking or zoom shots of the beautifully decorated and colored hallways of the hotel this is one of the conspicuous influences on the film Darkness which has similar color and decoration schemes.Another center for the Kangs is mealtime. We see them eating many times throughout the filmit's a way for them to gather their bearings if possible and figure out their plan of attack. One nicely symbolic scene shows everyone refraining from eating at the table except for Mina and her sister Misu Yunseong Lee as the family initially keeps the girls in the dark about the macabre goingson.Kim who also wrote The Quiet Family in addition to directing even spoofs the typical arthouse drama romance with a man who courts Misu a little too fervently and of course meets a twisted fate. This sets off a chain of events that lead to a very funny climax.The crux of the film is the everescalating occurrences and humorous attempts to cover them up. This provides amusing subtexts about how good intentions can lead to severely immoral actions and the guests even get in on this subtext a bit but at the same time we empathize with the protagonists as the Kangs at least may be making bad judgments but if they don't they could face worse consequences. This is a quiet family that wants to remain quiet. While I prefer the bizarreness of Happiness of the Katakuris at least slightly The Quiet Family is still a very good film and you just might prefer it if your tastes lean more towards arthouse dramas than the surreal and overthetop.".

They find themselves restless anxiously awaiting their first customer. When they finally get one he is later found dead in his room. The family covers it up to avoid bad publicity. Soon the business finally starts boomingand so does the body count! This story probably sounds familiar to fans of Asian horror. That's because Takashi Miike remade this into Happiness of the Katakuris with song and dance sequences zombies and claymation. The Quiet Family contains none of these elements but it is almost as delightful with its wicked sense of humor. Each family member my favorite being Mom has their own amusing quirks and I found myself chuckling out loud for the first half hour. Even when the story delves into morbid territory the silly characters still manage to provide the laughs. Watching a normal family react to very abnormal situations proves to be very funny. The pace is excellent though a few of the subplots almost push the story into a ridiculous place.Jiwoon Kim is also the director of the instant classic A Tale of Two Sisters. As with that film the set design use of rich colors and innovative camerawork are spectacular and largely responsible for the eerie atmosphere.The Quiet Family borders on absurd but it never fails to entertain. Despite its overthetop comedy and ridiculous scenarios it has a serious overall tone that sets it apart from most other horrorcomedies.My Rating 710.".

Even when the story delves into morbid territory the silly characters still manage to provide the laughs. Watching a normal family react to very abnormal situations proves to be very funny. The pace is excellent though a few of the subplots almost push the story into a ridiculous place.Jiwoon Kim is also the director of the instant classic A Tale of Two Sisters. As with that film the set design use of rich colors and innovative camerawork are spectacular and largely responsible for the eerie atmosphere.The Quiet Family borders on absurd but it never fails to entertain. Despite its overthetop comedy and ridiculous scenarios it has a serious overall tone that sets it apart from most other horrorcomedies.My Rating 710.";

A classic case of be careful what you wish for because it may actually come true in unexpected ways...Think of this as Korean version of the Addams Family.  This movie is a showcase of dark humor while several parallel subplots are going on.

It's a great film concept and the cinematography is second to none.It's very slow yet instantly jerks into action. It's got great casting. The actors are flawless. Even down to 5minute appearances. The score is first class and diverse. Rockglam from the Stray Cats to hip hop. The setting is also a little interesting.It's based in a remote area outside some woods. There is scheduled yet delayed construction for a road which will provide transportation for guests to the inn. However during the film the inn guests are mainly hikers and scenic people.The opening of the film involves this new family moving into a little run down house. They prepare the house and botch it up ready for guests. They have minimum advertising which is a sign. Literally. They wait for the guests to arrive. This opening scene is lighthearted and slow.Then the guests eventually arrive. All hell breaks loose. There is a moment of continuous bad luck from the moment the first guest arrives. This is when the film turns to film noir. All in all the film goes from an easy melodrama to something completely insane. It's a marvelous script and the slowness is rewarded by great tense sequences and various dilemmas for the unfortunate home owners.The film is superb. The casting spot on. The cinematography is awesome. A lot of different shots and slow camera movement to mimic the pace of the film. Then the unfortunate sequences occur the camera shots become more rapid and quick snappy close ups. I'm a big fan of this director and this film has to be his benchmark with the diverse range on offer.All in all a great film worth tracking down. Comedy film noir suspense horror isolation and deprivation. Superb acting and direction to match. I recommend it fully. 8 out of 10.".

When their very first customer commits suicide the family buries his body to avoid bad publicity. But it is only the beginning of their misfortune as more of their guests befall horrible fates leaving the family to handle the situation themselves.Written  directed by Kim Jeewoon the film quickly establishes the family dynamic before the main plot surfaces and even infuses a hint of something sinister brewing at the place. But once the bodies start piling up the comedic aspects take over the narrative and is utilised so well that the rest of the ride is jampacked with hilarity.The morbid humour is derived from the family's misfortune  their frantic actions to rectify the situation. Dialogues are sharp  zany characters are idiosyncratic and the family's continuous attempts to get rid of the dead bodies keeps the plot moving  engaging at all times. The twists  turns are predictable yet quite fun to watch.The remote location of the lodge surrounded by nothing but wilderness provides just the right setting for its plot to unfurl. Camerawork is smooth  controlled throughout as it helps in building tension which is then broken by the delectable wit. Editing isn't an issue either pacing the plot at a steady rate and keeping the amusement alive  kicking at all times.Coming to the performances The Quiet Family features Park Inhwan Na Moonhee Choi Minsik Song Kangho Go Hokyung  Lee Yoonseong as the Kang family and everyone plays their roles responsibly. But it's Song Kangho who steals the show for every scene featuring him is a delight as the thennew actor delivers a ribtickling showcase that only gets better with time.On an overall scale The Quiet Family marks an impressive start to Kim Jeewoon's filmmaking career and has aged really well over the years. Kim's direction exhibits a calculative approach that keeps looking for humour in every situation and the end result is a genuinely impressive debut feature. An essential step in the rise of Kim Jeewoon Song Kangho  Choi Minsik The Quiet Family is one of South Korean cinema's funniest offerings. Don't miss it.".

Of course this family ends up going from mishap to mishap and throughout most of it the two daughters are quite oblivious of what the rest of their family is doing.The first sense of foreboding comes from a blabbering old woman the youngest daughter and uncle assume to be crazy. Then after that things start to happen starting with a possible suicide in one of the rooms that leads into more mishaps misunderstandings and murder. But throughout all this the comedy is definitely there.However my main problem with it was the youngest daughter and her strange attitude throughout the movie. She seemed completely disconnected throughout most of the film and while for some parts this may have been funny for others it was just downright awful. I suppose that's why she was considered to be weird well the whole family is very weird!.Not the best comedy ever but certainly good to watch.".

I suppose that's why she was considered to be weird well the whole family is very weird!.Not the best comedy ever but certainly good to watch.";

	schema:reviewBody "I previously reviewed The Happiness of the Katakuris and have recommended it to all my friends. It's a wonderfully strange concoction from Takashi Miikethe Japanese director who seems quite adept in many genres. The film is a wacky fantasy musicalcomplete with dancing zombies significant portions done in claymation as well as a Japanese man who claims to be Queen Elizabeth's unknown child who ALSO works for the CIA! It's strange beyond belief but it also manages to be a heartfelt family movie that strongly advocates traditional values...and LOTS of accidental deaths. Imagine my surprise then when he told me that this film is NOT an original but was first made in South Korea as The Quiet Family! Naturally I HAD to see this original and fortunately he sent me a copy! I was so excited to see this film that I could practically burst!When the film begins you might also think this South Korean film is a musicalas it begins with a weird hiphop version of an old Herb Alpert song from the 1960s! And oddly throughout the film there are a lot of odd American tunesincluding one from the Partridge Family. BUT and this is important it was NOT a musicaland this was very disappointing. In the Miike film there were dancing zombies and other wondrous musical delights. But none of this is in The Quiet Family. I could live with this...though I missed the zombies. But what I couldn't believe was that this dark comedy really wasn't all that funny. Yes it had an original idea but it clearly did NOT make the most of it. Miike and his writers clearly were able to transform a rather average comedy into goldand often that meant significantly changing the original script.Like the remake the film is about a family that owns a small hotel in the middle of nowhere. Because of this their business is failingas the longpromised new highway has yet to be built and they have no customers for the longest time. Then out of the blue comes the first customer and the family is ecstatic. However when they check on their guest the next morning they find that the man had killed himself in the room...and he'd used his room key to do the deed! Fearing that this awful exposure would kill any chance at making the business a success they decide to bury the body. Guess what happens with the hotel's next guests? Yep...they die as well. And since they've already buried one guest burying a couple more won't be so bad...right?!At this point the plot of the two films are very very similarthough the deaths of the guests in The Quiet Family aren't really that funny but they sure are in The Happiness of the Katakuris. This sort of trend continues through the film as often the South Korean film fails to capitalize on potentially darkly funny situations. Additionally the film makes a huge mistake laterit does not keep the viewer liking the innocent family who just want to make a go of their new business. Instead some of the family members are pretty awful and so loses its charm and slowly fizzles. While The Quiet Family is not a bad film it is a definite disappointment considering that I first saw the PERFECT remake. The bottom line is that this is just a very rare case of a film where the remake is much much betterfunnier and actually much more original because of all the insane things they interject into the old plot. I almost always prefer the originals unless there is a serious flaw in it. In the case of The Quiet Family there were several serious flaws.".

And incidentally this was his FIRST FEATURE FILM DEBUT.The acting is top notch all the characters have their own quirky traits and the incidences in the film just continue to get magnanimous...Is there a moral to this film? I think there is! Its for you to find out dear viewer.Plot An extended family has moved from the city presumably Seoul to live in a large house out in the mountains which they convert into a lodge for hikers. Consisting of a middle aged father Kang DaeGoo Park InHwan mother Jeong SoonRyae Na MoonHee DaeGoo's younger brother Kang ChangGoo played by Choi Minsik and their adult children Kang YoungMin played by Song Kangho Kang MiSoo Lee YoonSeong and Kang Mina played by Go HoKyung they suffer a string of misfortunes as various patrons come to stay.Their first guest a hiker asks for a room and three beers. Left to himself he spends the night forging his room key holder to be sharp enough to stab himself and is found dead the next morning. The father of the family decides on burying the body in the woods under the assumption that no one would believe this to be a suicide. Later a young couple drops in for a stay to have sex in the privacy of their room and end up dead together the next morning. A pair of friends from town stop by for drinks until one of the men falls for MiSoo and subsequently attempts to rape her but she is saved by YoungMin who accidentally ends up pushing the man off a cliff while his friend is taken captive by the family to prevent him from calling the police.Mr. Park the benefactor of the family providing them the house later asks for their lodging for his younger and illegitimate half sister to have a hitman check into the neighboring room at midnight and murder her so he can be the only successor to claim inheritance of the soon profitable land. Uninformed of the plan Uncle Kang senses foul play and sends the half sister home to Seoul when she is found to be restless. The plan goes further awry when the hitman arrives fifteen minutes late and the room had been taken by an undercover cop investigating the recent string of missing people mistaken to be the hitman. The hitman thus ends up killing the cop instead and later gets killed by a suspicious YoungMin.A heavy rainstorm overnight nearly uncovers the buried corpses by morning leaving the family no choice but to incinerate them. When uncle returns from the trip to Seoul he angers DaeGoo who had hoped to settle Mr. Park's plot without any trouble. A fight ensues as uncle is beaten senseless but is saved from a blow to the head by YoungMin who then trips hitting his head on the stairs he is whisked to the hospital leaving the elderly parents the only ones left to finish the job. The local man having been imprisoned bound and gagged tries to make his escape but gets his ropes tangled in several trees as he escapes the lodge.Soon enough Mr. Park drops in unannounced to check if his sisterinlaw has been terminated as planned but is in complete shock when he sees Mr. Kang and Mrs. Jeong carrying the corpse of the undercover cop knowing that he wasn't the hitman. A brief struggle begins when Mr. Park tries to escape without trying to figure out just what exactly has happened and ends after he accidentally falls to his death down the stairs adding yet another body to be done away with for the family.To drive away attention Mrs. Jeong switches off the circuits throughout the lodge and outside storage where she and her husband are piling the corpses dousing them in gasoline. Mina trying to watch TV asks for Uncle Kang to switch the circuits back on inadvertently causing a socket in the storage to burst in flames triggering the cremation fire prematurely trapping the parents inside. Meanwhile YoungMin is in the hospital recovering from his concussion and laughing insanely over a news report on the shooting of a North Korean agent wandering through the forest.After an uncertain amount of time later Uncle Kang YoungMin MiSoo and Mina are preparing to serve dinner totally unaware of the fire in the storage building. The parents return in bandages having survived the fire. Without a single word the family quietly has dinner until there is a sudden knock at the door. Unsure of what to do they all stand quietly in the doorway of the dining room waiting for whoever is at the door to go away. When the dog starts barking at the knocking the family in unison hushes the dog they have become the quiet family.The film ends with a wide shot of the lodge in winter with Mina outside looking at it and then to the camera with an uncertain look on her face all to the sound of The Partridge Family's I Think I Love You.Verdict Just BUY IT!!! P.S I also recommend you see I Saw The Devil2010 and A Tale of Two Sisters2003 both directed by Kim Jiwoon.".

	schema:headline " Firmly directed and delicately balancing both its premise and content with some decent situational comedy The Quiet Family is close to something to shout about.";
	schema:reviewBody "Death in some form was always going to worm its way to the secluded motel the Kang family run in 1998 South Korean film The Quiet Family. Where bloody situational comedy rules the roost for the best part of about an hour or so in Jiwoon Kim's film about a luckless family stylised neo noir takes over shoving the film onto a higher realm of cause and effect whilst effectively further involving an even larger number of parties when the inclusion of hit men and organised killings on those staying at said place of rest. The film treads a fine line between effective black comedy and grossly misguided misfire the crucial difference being that the deaths are not the focal point of whatever laughs you'll garner out of it rather the resulting actions that the innocents caught up in the middle of it all undertake in order to try and rectify said situations. Importantly we're on the Kang family's side a large group of people running a new motel in a secluded woodland area trying to get by in their new business venture and succeed at a sort of American Dream. When tenants turn up and more often than not need to be carried out rather than anything else the film has fun with its premise of this rag tag bunch of people completely ill attuned to death or murder just wanting to get by with this new business acquisition being plunged into a scenario far grimmer.MiSoo Lee YoonSeong appears to be out guide beginning as our narrator as the figure of her lounging on a sofa the subject of the first instance of an eerie swooping camera composition which will periodically litter the rest of the film. She's restless of the Americanised hiphop music that plays informs us of the supposedly cursed rest place the lodge is and ever so fleetingly glances at the camera in a slight instance of the fourth wall being broken. The rest of the Kangs wait impatiently for a lodger of any kind to christen the place of business and when a hiker arrives they fawn over the signing of his name in the register in a close to all but eerily leering manner. The discovery of his dead body the following morning as a result of a suicide kicks off a string of deaths of guests which leave the family floundering as to what they ought to do and why what's happening to them is happening.In what would be seen as quite daft in most other films but here delivered with a knowing nod a wondering and rambling elderly woman claims to be able to see a sort of angel of death figure perched on the roof of the lodging premises invisible of course to everyone else. The angel of death claim provides a mythical and unseen element to proceedings the film's reoccurring use of that long tracking composition might be seen as this supposed angel's perspective an escalated point of view on proceedings which allows an outsider to observe what is happening to the Kang family whilst remaining entirely invisible mirroring the audience's own point of spectatorship on the happenings. Indeed a while into the piece a number of characters set up a camp fire beside a tree the camera slowly coming back down from an oddly positioned angle on a tree branch down to ground level so as to form a more normalised composition on the ground and cover the ensuing chaos that is born out of the result of this camp fire exchange. As if a strange casting of a spell on those involved in the scene has been completed and then a moving down to ground level so as to observe the chaos as perpetrated by this so called angel which then plays out.Oddly most of the early deaths are linked in some shape or form to sexual escapades. Certainly of those that die so early on are in some form linked to sexual encounters. There is a couple whom stay there and make love before killing themselves by way of pills and later on an attempted rape on MiSoo is thwarted by a family member resulting in the death of the perpetrator. Much has been written of sexual escapades in certain films of the horror genre ultimately leading to a character's demise in what is an almost ritualistic procession of skin and flesh followed by blood and guts. Here Kim has a couple that make love prior to killing themselves but it sees him render the sex itself the ritualistic act  a final action in each of their lives before a death they brought upon themselves.From here the imprisonment of the rapist's travelling partner takes the idea of being lumbered with the body of somebody you don't want and spins it so that the person this time is still alive but unable to alert the authorities thus effectively escalating the chaos without veering too far away from its foundations. There can be little doubt that the writerdirector Kim realises running the film on the off beat premise isn't enough and suddenly decides to throw in a plot to do with the organised murdering of someone which would greatly benefit a certain Mr. Park the lodge benefactor within the field of insurance.

	onyx:emotionText "Death in some form was always going to worm its way to the secluded motel the Kang family run in 1998 South Korean film The Quiet Family. Where bloody situational comedy rules the roost for the best part of about an hour or so in Jiwoon Kim's film about a luckless family stylised neo noir takes over shoving the film onto a higher realm of cause and effect whilst effectively further involving an even larger number of parties when the inclusion of hit men and organised killings on those staying at said place of rest. The film treads a fine line between effective black comedy and grossly misguided misfire the crucial difference being that the deaths are not the focal point of whatever laughs you'll garner out of it rather the resulting actions that the innocents caught up in the middle of it all undertake in order to try and rectify said situations. Importantly we're on the Kang family's side a large group of people running a new motel in a secluded woodland area trying to get by in their new business venture and succeed at a sort of American Dream. When tenants turn up and more often than not need to be carried out rather than anything else the film has fun with its premise of this rag tag bunch of people completely ill attuned to death or murder just wanting to get by with this new business acquisition being plunged into a scenario far grimmer.MiSoo Lee YoonSeong appears to be out guide beginning as our narrator as the figure of her lounging on a sofa the subject of the first instance of an eerie swooping camera composition which will periodically litter the rest of the film. She's restless of the Americanised hiphop music that plays informs us of the supposedly cursed rest place the lodge is and ever so fleetingly glances at the camera in a slight instance of the fourth wall being broken. The rest of the Kangs wait impatiently for a lodger of any kind to christen the place of business and when a hiker arrives they fawn over the signing of his name in the register in a close to all but eerily leering manner. The discovery of his dead body the following morning as a result of a suicide kicks off a string of deaths of guests which leave the family floundering as to what they ought to do and why what's happening to them is happening.In what would be seen as quite daft in most other films but here delivered with a knowing nod a wondering and rambling elderly woman claims to be able to see a sort of angel of death figure perched on the roof of the lodging premises invisible of course to everyone else. The angel of death claim provides a mythical and unseen element to proceedings the film's reoccurring use of that long tracking composition might be seen as this supposed angel's perspective an escalated point of view on proceedings which allows an outsider to observe what is happening to the Kang family whilst remaining entirely invisible mirroring the audience's own point of spectatorship on the happenings. Indeed a while into the piece a number of characters set up a camp fire beside a tree the camera slowly coming back down from an oddly positioned angle on a tree branch down to ground level so as to form a more normalised composition on the ground and cover the ensuing chaos that is born out of the result of this camp fire exchange. As if a strange casting of a spell on those involved in the scene has been completed and then a moving down to ground level so as to observe the chaos as perpetrated by this so called angel which then plays out.Oddly most of the early deaths are linked in some shape or form to sexual escapades. Certainly of those that die so early on are in some form linked to sexual encounters. There is a couple whom stay there and make love before killing themselves by way of pills and later on an attempted rape on MiSoo is thwarted by a family member resulting in the death of the perpetrator. Much has been written of sexual escapades in certain films of the horror genre ultimately leading to a character's demise in what is an almost ritualistic procession of skin and flesh followed by blood and guts. Here Kim has a couple that make love prior to killing themselves but it sees him render the sex itself the ritualistic act  a final action in each of their lives before a death they brought upon themselves.From here the imprisonment of the rapist's travelling partner takes the idea of being lumbered with the body of somebody you don't want and spins it so that the person this time is still alive but unable to alert the authorities thus effectively escalating the chaos without veering too far away from its foundations. There can be little doubt that the writerdirector Kim realises running the film on the off beat premise isn't enough and suddenly decides to throw in a plot to do with the organised murdering of someone which would greatly benefit a certain Mr. Park the lodge benefactor within the field of insurance. The tale to do with an assassin a police officer and a case of mistaken identity isn't exactly of the Coen brothers mould but it isn't far off. This as a nearby construction site allows the film to further inflict pain on its leads as it forces the family to reverse the agonising process of burying the dead bodies in excavating them so as not to allow the builders to find them. From its early tale of extraordinary things happening to ordinary people to its comedic content running on a catalyst of mistaken identity The Quiet Family is a rare offbeat film which doesn't annoy nor outstay its welcome.";

	schema:headline " Kim's first was a black comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "The Quiet Family is Kim Jiwoon's debut feature. Having had much appreciation for his later works I thought I'd track down his earliest one to see if he had it from the start. Crafting a somewhat black comedy about a family that runs a struggling lodge in the woods I have to say that he largely succeeded.The story is about the titular family who have yet to have a guest. Of course as it turns out their first few guests happen to have a habit of perishing. A series of increasingly trouble coverups and escalations occur until all hell breaks loose. And sure that sounds pretty vague but while the film isn't terribly laugh out loud I do have to admit I was well engaged and amused during the majority of it. I think the strength of the films lies in its suspense we empathize with the family and despite their bad decisions leading to some of their troubles their mostly hard luck cases and so we struggle with them as they try to keep their inn running amidst the increasing body count.I think there is a weakness and it's that the epilogue although amusing is a bit logically distorted. It's like a twist that was aborted leading to a rather nonsensical sense. Sort of takes the air out of the film.Actor's all do an impressive job really and their chemistry with each other is great. Their ability to deliver the rather straightfaced brand of humor necessary for this kind of comedy helps keep the edge in the blackness of the comedy and lend to the believability of the story. Production values are a little weak being a film shot before the industry burst open in Corea however the direction and art of the film is unmistakably strong and helps give the film an air of aesthetic strength that it might not have had otherwise.Kim's film is rather entertaining and while it won't please those who don't like black comedies it's otherwise a sometimes suspenseful mostly amusing and surprisingly engaging piece. Like Kim's other films it doesn't aim at art cinema but rather appears to be a strong distillation and synthesis of the darkhorrorcomedy genre. And for that I can recommend it. 810.".

I really liked the way the plot and the characters developed.  To me I thought the cast were all a little out there but isn't all of humanity like that in form or another.  Kevin Kline did very well as an unfairly disgraced homocide cop who had a beatnik mentality.  He turned what many might consider a very below standard screenplay and turned it into a watchable film.  His performance is the best of the movie.  The performances of Alan Rickman Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Danny Aiello are also noteworthy.  There are a few flaws in this film but it was a great work overall.  It isn't as bad as the IMDB rating suggests.  It is very adult and somewhat intellectual and it is almost believable.  The ending surprised me and I don't think it was chinsy or overdone.  I think it was supposed to try and imitate real life a little bit and it succeeded.  It may not fit a particular genre but that doesn't mean it stinks.  This is a film that doesn't conform to certain Hollywood standards and that is the main reason I liked it.  This is one of Kevin Kline's best films and I suggest the detractors should take another look at it.  The January Man is one of the most underrated films of all time and it will probably always be that way.9 out of 10.  It's amazing what 10 bucks and the bargain DVD rack at WalMart can get you.".

He's recalled to duty at the Mayor's orders and with the help of some Free Spirits artistecomputer whiz Alan Rickman adorable Mary Liz Mastrontonio our guy deciphers the clues and etc etc. the movie is riddled with clichs including a Former Lover Susan Sarandon and a Jealous Rival Danny Aiello. its full of New Yawk actors shouting fbombs and Kline is not very convincing as a streetsmart detective somebody more bluecollar like Bruce Willis might have pulled it off. a lot of this is awful playful considering the subject matter. Rickman as the artiste and Harvey Keitel as a somber administrator come off best of the performers. honestly this is nothing you haven't seen before.".

He's recalled to duty at the Mayor's orders and with the help of some Free Spirits artistecomputer whiz Alan Rickman adorable Mary Liz Mastrontonio our guy deciphers the clues and etc etc. the movie is riddled with clichs including a Former Lover Susan Sarandon and a Jealous Rival Danny Aiello. its full of New Yawk actors shouting fbombs and Kline is not very convincing as a streetsmart detective somebody more bluecollar like Bruce Willis might have pulled it off. a lot of this is awful playful considering the subject matter. Rickman as the artiste and Harvey Keitel as a somber administrator come off best of the performers. honestly this is nothing you haven't seen before.";

The battle took place on December 13 1939 and the British came out on top. The Graf Spee headed for the neutral harbor of Montevideo Uruguay. They were given only a short time to effect repairs and the British did their best to make them believe a British fleet of 6 or 8 ships awaited them.

	schema:reviewBody "The pocket battleship in armor and armament somewhere between a battleship and a heavy cruiser Graf Spee is abroad in the Atlantic sinking British merchant shipping. She is tracked down by three British and New Zealand cruisers and after a fierce battle takes refuge in the harbor of Montevideo Uruguay. In accordance with the Hague Convention the Graf Spee's Captain Langsdorff is given barely enough time to make his ship seaworthy without improving her fighting efficiency before having to leave port. We aren't told exactly what her fighting efficiency is like but we learn she's taken more than fifty hits on the superstructure alone from the British 8inch guns and those are big guns. There are shenanigans going on at the embassies in Montevideo in which the French and British try to force the Graf Spee to leave as soon as possible while the Germans argue for more time. All of this is reported by an opportunistic American from a wellpositioned outdoor cafe where the proprietor demands he keep ordering scotch if he's going to sit there and take up the customers' space. Langsdorff is cleverly led by the British to assume that the three cruisers waiting for him outside the harbor have been joined by several other capital ships including an aircraft carrier. The rumor has been deliberately spread by British staff over an unscrambled phone line in a hilarious scene and everyone believes it including Langsdorff. The German captain takes his ship out of the harbor at the appointed time but scuttles her after ordering the crew off. The British have won the Battle of the River Plate partly through courage and partly through intelligent use of misinformation.Actually considering that it's a war movie it's pretty good natured. The British crack jokes in the midst of battle. When a shell hits nearby and burns up some possessions one sailor approaches another bearing a pair of charred boots on a tray and asks You ordered the toast? When sailors die they do so almost nonchalantly with time for a brave few words like See to the others. As far as that goes the film gives you a fairly decent picture of what sea duty can be like operating the rudder from the steering aft position for instance. What a job! The movie demonstrates the advantage of using real ships instead of models. The problem with model work has to do with texture. The splashes of exploding shells for instance send up drops of water as big as basketballs. But here there is some dropdead gorgeous photography of ships making smoke and heeling around. Not even modern computer graphics could manage so effectively. The Germans are treated humanely too this being 1956 and not 1946. The Germans have a number of British prisoners aboard the Graf Spee and they celebrate Christmas together with the captors presenting the captives with Christmas decorations. When a German officer announces to the prisoners that they will soon be released in Montevideo he cheers along with the British. Among the funniest scenes are those involving the blowhard American reporter. The whole world is watching and waiting with suspense for the Battle of the Ages or something like that. Lays it on a bit thick doesn't he? asks one British listener. After a few days of this boreal oratory the reporter's voice is going and he begins to swill liquor surrounded by a dozen glasses of scotch. Excuse me while I get a drink he hoarsely tells his listeners. Withall though there is a tragic figure here and that is the wounded Captain Langsdorff who has fought the good fight and is now forced to sail his ship into what he believes is certain disaster. Finch does a good job with the role as does the script. There isn't a moment when he loses his dignity. And his courtliness seems inbred. The Brits say of him He's a gentleman and He's a good seaman. A cheaper movie would have given Finch an unnecessary speech A captain belongs to his ship just as the ship belongs to the captain. This is breaking my heart. I feel as if someone had just taken my Marzipan away. It's a genuinely sad moment when we see the coffins of the German sailors killed in battle. And although the movie ends with the victorious and quite beautiful white British cruisers sailing off into the sunset the fact is that Langsdorff shot and killed himself shortly after these events.".

And although the movie ends with the victorious and quite beautiful white British cruisers sailing off into the sunset the fact is that Langsdorff shot and killed himself shortly after these events.";

	schema:headline " A masterful depiction of the first major naval battle of the Second World War.";
	schema:reviewBody "I often wonder why this film was renamed The Battle of the River Plate when the actual action took place 150 miles to the east in the South Atlantic. Nevertheless it is a great production brought all the closer to reality by the use of two of the original Allied cruisers which were still in commission at the time of filming. The big problem was the choice of a warship to fill the role of the pocket battleship Graf Spee which had already been scuttled and that of her two sister ships which were also destroyed before the end of the war. The choice of the heavy cruiser  USS Salem while not perfect was probably the best the producers could come up with despite it's extra tier of forward and rear main guns and the familiar U.S. Navy number 139 on it's bough. The storyline of the film is held together through the eyes of Captain Dove played by Bernard Lee who is taken aboard the Graf Spee after his merchant ship Africa Shell becomes one of her victims. Loosely held as a prisoner Dove is given an insight into the Graf Spee's tactics as a surface raider and that she is in fact masquerading as an American warship with false gun turrets and a bough number solving the producers dilemma of explaining the different physical characteristics of each warship. The actual battle while well done does show a few inconsistencies in that the near miss salvos are more like large splashes and at times the Graf Spee looks motionless while being bombarded by allied shells. This is more than made up by the fine acting of the combatants with Anthony Quale giving a best of British tradition role as task force leader Commodore Henry Harwood along with John Gregson as Captain Bell of HMS Exeter and Jack Gwillim as Captain Parry of the New Zealand cruiser Achilles. Peter Finch is perfect in the role of the chivalrous and compassionate German commander of the Graf Spee Hans Langsdorff who in real life displayed these rare qualities and was immensely respected by those on both sides of the conflict. When the Graf Spee puts into Montevideo harbour in neutral Uruguay to effect repairs a great diplomatic battle ensues over her sanctuary and the story switches to a tense minute by minute dockside radio coverage by American reporter Mike Fowler played in true journalistic style by Lionel Murton. Meanwhile two of the three British Cruisers supported by a newly arrived warship Cumberland maintain a vigil out to sea while their embassy engages in it's own brand of propaganda to deceive the Germans into believing they are up against a vastly superior British naval force. Langsdorff falls for the ruse and after seeing his men to safety scuttles his mighty warship precisely at sunset a few miles out of Montevideo in the mouth of the River Plate. With the expectations that another and greater naval action was forthcoming this fateful decision gives the end of the film somewhat of an anticlimax but it was the factual truth and a necessary conclusion to maintain it's credibility. To add a final footnote there is presently underway a large salvage operation to raise as much of the Graf Spee as possible and eventually put it on display in a museum in Montevideo.".

Perhaps what prevents it from getting its due is that it looks like another entry in the big WW II battle recreation genre but the structure the performances and the film's intent in general aren't really in the service of that genre. The climactic battle is fought in the middle of the film and the last third unexpectedly takes place on the docks and in the cafes and embassies of Montevideo with a festival air and comedy relief. Powell rightly feels that the core of the film is Bernard Lee's admiration of his captor indeed the final scene is the expression of that admiration. Yet the viewer isn't pointed to that relationship. All the expository dialogue serves the battle sceneswhere the Spee might be how to attack it the relationship between the British Commodore and his Captainsand later the strategies of the Spee's leaving port. Particularly in the latter part there's a lot of discussion which doesn't relate to the film's denouement. And the collection of British prisoners on the Spee don't coalesce into an ensemble. In an odd way their fate never seems integrated into the battle nor does it particularly highlight the relationship between Lee and Finch. This unusual structure is in part due to the film apparently following actual events fairly closely and actual events don't follow conventional dramatic structure. But really that absence of conventional structure and the refusal to emphasize the LeeFinch relationship or to make it a dominant theme are the film's greatest strengths. Finally note should be taken of the superb photography in VistaVision.".

	schema:headline " Diplomatic maneuvering and naval gunpowder make a fine Powell and Pressburger movie";
	schema:reviewBody "If you'd like to see how talk and diplomatic maneuvering in the hands of two masterful filmmakers can turn what could have been a routine action movie into something special try Powell and Pressburger's The Battle of the River Plate. It's late 1939 and WWII has started. The German pocket battleship Graf Spee is wreaking havoc with British shipping. Three British cruisers led by Commodore Henry Harwood John Quayle are in pursuit. Harwood makes an educated guess that Captain Hans Langsdorff Peter Finch will head toward South America for one last series of kills before returning home. He's right and the first part of the movie is a brutal sea battle between the Graf Spee which has 11inch guns and hits harder farther and faster than anything the British have and HMS Exeter HMNZS Achilles and HMS Ajax. They are determined to kill the Graf Spee even though they only have 6inch and 8 inch guns. The result? Exeter is badly damaged and must try to make it to the Falklands. Achilles and Ajax are damaged too but so is the Graf Spee. Langsdorff disengages and heads for neutral Montevideo trailed by Achilles and Ajax. And now we get to the heart of the movie. Under the laws of the sea Langsdorff has two days to make the Graf Spee seaworthy before he must return to sea. He is low on ammunition. If he leaves the harbor with guns blazing he just might be able to take out Ajax and Achilles. After first working to insure Langsdorff is given no more time to affect repairs the British realize that there is a chance that at least one British ship a heavy cruiser could arrive in time for battle. That would change the odds dramatically against Langsdorff. So now the British cleverly set false rumors that British warships are just beyond the horizon and ready for battle. They've placed Langsdorff in a crucial dilemma. If he thinks he leaves harbor now he faces a strengthened British force and will probably loose. If he waits for further repairs the situation won't improve. He could make a dash for Buenos Aires not far away. Although Argentina is neutral it is friendly to Germany. But the channel is narrow and shallow. If the Graf Spee goes aground it will be a sitting target for the reinforced British. Langsdorff has no stomach for the fiery and pointless death of his sailors. All this is played out in meetings telephone conversations and messages all swirling around the diplomats of three countries Britain Germany and Uruguay. Langsdorff has little time to decide. Thanks to the British setting up false rumors his choices all seem poor. But perhaps in Langsdorff's mind an immediate attempt at escape might be the least unattractive. He realizes there is a further choice which is unexpected. Powell and Pressburger have given us a clever film without clichs. No tearful wives no anxious or twotiming sweethearts no sailors used as lowerclass comedy relief no noble sacrifices to save others and no slimy Nazis. Powell uses the device of captured British captains held on the Graf Spee as a way to give us matteroffact interplay between the British and the Germans. One captured captain is used as a means for Langsdorff to explain to him and Powell and Pressburger to explain to us what the Graf Spee does how strong it is how it is supplied and the kind of man Langsdorff is. Powell and Pressburger use the discussions between Harwood and his fighting captains to help us understand Harwood's strategy and the battle tactics he's employing. The battle itself filmed in the Mediterranean using ships from the navies of Britain and other countries including a heavy cruiser from the U.S. to stand in for the Graf Spee is dramatically and efficiently filmed. Almost no models were used except at the explosive conclusion. But it is the inaction half of this action movie which is so cleverly worked out. Powell and Pressburger manage to keep us highly involved with the diplomatic toandfroing. The fact that the people of Montevideo were fascinated with this giant German pocket battleship in their harbor is played to the hilt. The fate of the Graf Spee at the conclusion of the movie is watched from the harbor walls by thousands all the while an American broadcaster is giving to radio listeners a description of what is occurring. It's quite an effective scene...and it actually happened. The Battle of the River Plate if made by anyone other than Powell and Pressburger might well be seen as a quirky classic of its genre. But the great films of these two were in the past. They would make one more movie the next year a film Powell called nothing more than a programmer and they would then go still friends their separate ways. The partnership that gave us The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp A Matter of Life and Death The Red Shoes I Know Where I'm Going A Canterbury Tale and Black Narcissus was over.

	onyx:emotionText "If you'd like to see how talk and diplomatic maneuvering in the hands of two masterful filmmakers can turn what could have been a routine action movie into something special try Powell and Pressburger's The Battle of the River Plate. It's late 1939 and WWII has started. The German pocket battleship Graf Spee is wreaking havoc with British shipping. Three British cruisers led by Commodore Henry Harwood John Quayle are in pursuit. Harwood makes an educated guess that Captain Hans Langsdorff Peter Finch will head toward South America for one last series of kills before returning home. He's right and the first part of the movie is a brutal sea battle between the Graf Spee which has 11inch guns and hits harder farther and faster than anything the British have and HMS Exeter HMNZS Achilles and HMS Ajax. They are determined to kill the Graf Spee even though they only have 6inch and 8 inch guns. The result? Exeter is badly damaged and must try to make it to the Falklands. Achilles and Ajax are damaged too but so is the Graf Spee. Langsdorff disengages and heads for neutral Montevideo trailed by Achilles and Ajax. And now we get to the heart of the movie. Under the laws of the sea Langsdorff has two days to make the Graf Spee seaworthy before he must return to sea. He is low on ammunition. If he leaves the harbor with guns blazing he just might be able to take out Ajax and Achilles. After first working to insure Langsdorff is given no more time to affect repairs the British realize that there is a chance that at least one British ship a heavy cruiser could arrive in time for battle. That would change the odds dramatically against Langsdorff. So now the British cleverly set false rumors that British warships are just beyond the horizon and ready for battle. They've placed Langsdorff in a crucial dilemma. If he thinks he leaves harbor now he faces a strengthened British force and will probably loose. If he waits for further repairs the situation won't improve. He could make a dash for Buenos Aires not far away. Although Argentina is neutral it is friendly to Germany. But the channel is narrow and shallow. If the Graf Spee goes aground it will be a sitting target for the reinforced British. Langsdorff has no stomach for the fiery and pointless death of his sailors. All this is played out in meetings telephone conversations and messages all swirling around the diplomats of three countries Britain Germany and Uruguay. Langsdorff has little time to decide. Thanks to the British setting up false rumors his choices all seem poor. But perhaps in Langsdorff's mind an immediate attempt at escape might be the least unattractive. He realizes there is a further choice which is unexpected. Powell and Pressburger have given us a clever film without clichs. No tearful wives no anxious or twotiming sweethearts no sailors used as lowerclass comedy relief no noble sacrifices to save others and no slimy Nazis. Powell uses the device of captured British captains held on the Graf Spee as a way to give us matteroffact interplay between the British and the Germans. One captured captain is used as a means for Langsdorff to explain to him and Powell and Pressburger to explain to us what the Graf Spee does how strong it is how it is supplied and the kind of man Langsdorff is. Powell and Pressburger use the discussions between Harwood and his fighting captains to help us understand Harwood's strategy and the battle tactics he's employing. The battle itself filmed in the Mediterranean using ships from the navies of Britain and other countries including a heavy cruiser from the U.S. to stand in for the Graf Spee is dramatically and efficiently filmed. Almost no models were used except at the explosive conclusion. But it is the inaction half of this action movie which is so cleverly worked out. Powell and Pressburger manage to keep us highly involved with the diplomatic toandfroing. The fact that the people of Montevideo were fascinated with this giant German pocket battleship in their harbor is played to the hilt. The fate of the Graf Spee at the conclusion of the movie is watched from the harbor walls by thousands all the while an American broadcaster is giving to radio listeners a description of what is occurring. It's quite an effective scene...and it actually happened. The Battle of the River Plate if made by anyone other than Powell and Pressburger might well be seen as a quirky classic of its genre. But the great films of these two were in the past. They would make one more movie the next year a film Powell called nothing more than a programmer and they would then go still friends their separate ways. The partnership that gave us The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp A Matter of Life and Death The Red Shoes I Know Where I'm Going A Canterbury Tale and Black Narcissus was over. We're left with these great and wonderful films. If The Battle of the River Plate is not one of them it still is an effective professional and clever movie and so typical of the way these two men avoided conventionality.";

The cameras of the world's press focused on Montevideo as the German ship struggled to regain its fighting ability while the Royal Navy converged to attack when it was inevitably forced to leave. A brilliant espionage operation convinced Captain Hans Langsdorff that 12 the British navy was waiting for him so he scuttled the ship in the harbor and subsequently shot himself. Those are the facts and they're wonderfully recreated in this riveting film. Powell and Pressburger paid meticulous attention to detail and it shows throughout. I really admired their honesty in showing the battle and what happened later as objectively as it could be whilst still always remaining good entertainment. Peter Finch gave a fantastic intense performance as the doomed Captain. The real Langsdorff was a man of the highest intelligence and integrity a tragic example of a fine man who found himself forced to serve an evil regime and Finch truly conveyed the battle Langsdorff must have been fighting within himself conscience versus duty. In the end his conscience won. Captain Langsdorff took his own life in a hotel room lying on an old imperial German navy flag a calculated insult to Hitler. I'm glad the Graf Spee was destroyed but sad that Langsdorff was one of SO many victims of this terrible war. The Battle Of The River Plate is an excellent portrayal of this truelife drama.

Black and white photography also makes the shift between location and studio work much less obvious.There are some good performances in the film notably Peter Finch as Langsdorff. I remember seeing newsreel footage of the real Langsdorff attending the funeral of his men in Montevideo he gave a German Naval salute instead of the Nazi version. His portrayal as a 'decent' German has a basis in fact.The battle of the River Plate was the last Naval action to take place without the benefit of technical advances such as radar. It was a fine piece of seamanship and the story deserved to be told. At the end of this film unfortunately you can't help feeling it could have been told better.".

I see that some viewers didn't like it and found the British officers standing around on the deck doing nothing boring. I thought it was amusing. What do you expect them to do on the open sea hour after hour day after day? What was great about this movie was that it was not predictable not formulaic and jingoistic like Bismark! It was surprisingly modern in its values and acting a bit like Three Kings. The weak spot was perhaps the portrayal of the South Americans in the background during the radio broadcasts but I think this was intended to display the absurdity of the carnival atmosphere. Speaking of which it reminded me strongly of the opening of Woody Allen's Bananans where television is broadcasting live the assassination of a banana republic dictator who was the only one not in on the secret. Could this be the inspiration?Apparently the movie portrays the key players accurately and there were seamen involved who were advisers to the film  I think including Capt. Dove.What makes this movie shine is the intriguing characters most of all Captain Langsdorff. What was he thinking what were his deep motives? Spoiler alert.The ending brings this into sharp contrast though the movie's ending leaves things open though the historical ending fills in this gap. We are left to ponder why he did what he did. I have my own theories and I think that deep down he did not want to return to Nazi Germany and wanted to spare his crew from this.I strongly suggest watching this together with Bismark! They have similar themes. In the 50s and early 60s part of British cinema was extremely conservative politically and cinematically and was way way behind the times creatively. Bismark! exemplifies that and looks more like a 1942 movie than 1960. The British and American viewing office didn't complain. But from today's perspective Bismark! was a missed opportunity at a great film a potential demonstrated years earlier by the Graf Spee. Compared to the Graf Spee Bismark! is hopelessly boring but good for you much like oatmeal.I think Graf Spee holds up very well by modern standards of acting and directing. It is also a fitting memorial to Captain Langsdorff who acted in the end honorably.".

The ship used in the movie as the Graf Spee was the USS Salem CA139 Heavy cruiser. Filming on board the US Salem was taken while she was on duty in the Mediterranean. The US Salem at the time was the US Navy's Flag Ship 6th fleet. Some of the Salem's crew participated as German sailors. I rate the movie as a firstclass documentary.

	schema:reviewBody "The Battle of the River Plate is an almost documentary like account of the battle of the German pocket battleship Graf Spee with three allied cruisers and what happened to her subsequently. Heading the small mini fleet was Captain Anthony Quayle and the German captain of the Graf Spee was played by Peter Finch.December of 1939 was the period known as the 'phony war'. Poland had been overrun by the Nazis and the British and French forces were on the continent safely behind the Maginot line or so they thought at the time. What action there was at this time was on the sea with various naval engagements here and there.The Graf Spee was doing one number on British commerce in the South Atlantic. It sank nine British merchant vessels but her captain was no Nazi. He observed the rules of war strictly picked up sailors from the sunken vessels and all reported good treatment at his hands. When he did reach Montevideo he let all the British sailors go. Sad to say this was not something repeated during World War II.In any event two British and one New Zealand cruiser the Ajax the Achilles and the Exeter took on the Graf Spee and fought it to a bloody standstill. The British were lucky to have facilities at the Falkland Islands for repair. But the Graf Spee headed for Montevideo which was neutral territory at the time.I'm not quite sure why they did not make for the friendlier shores of Buenos Aires on the River Plate. Even though Juan Peron had not taken charge in Argentina it was still friendlier to the Germans than Uruguay was. Possibly Finch's character Lansdorff knew the history of Uruguay a country founded as a neutral buffer state between Argentina and Brazil. In any event the Uruguayans operated correctly under the assumption that they would be at war sooner or later with the Germans as indeed were all the Latin American countries except Argentina after Pearl Harbor. The Graf Spee would have made quite the prize indeed.As German British and Uruguayan diplomats tried to negotiate Finch took action and blew up the Graf Spee in the middle of the River Plate. The Nazi propaganda machine made him a martyr which in fact he was and the British public was given something to cheer about in those beginning days of World War II.Finch and Quayle give good performances as a pair of gallant adversaries and The Battle Of The River Plate is a fine war film from the United Kingdom in which even the enemy behaved gallantly.".

If the real Graf Spee had left Monte Video and battled it out with the Allied warships waiting for her then this film could have had a tremendous ending rather than the somewhat sad scuttling of the great doomed ship by her own crew. Of course Captain Langsdorf was ordered to sink his own ship rather than face defeat  and also her Captain was influenced by his desire not to waste the lives of his crew in a perceived no win situation for the ship. Langsdorf was by all accounts an honourable Captain who did not like the Nazi party. This side of his nature is actually portrayed well in the film by Peter Finch's compassionate portrayal. Anthony Quayle  mysteriously always underrated as a film actor  gives another good performance here. Unfortunately for the cast  they do have to put up with some quite substandard studio sets during the sequences on the ship bridges. Fall of shot looks like Dolphin sneezes not large shell splashes. Offsetting this is the use of the actual allied ships used in the battle with nice seagoing footage. An American heavy cruiser fills the role of the Graf Spee  her number on her bow explained away as the Graf Spee masquerading as a U.S warship  reasonably well. War buffs of course will notice a big difference in ships but the average filmgoer will be happy. the script is quite tight and holds the film together during the landbased scenes. Most of the cast do a great job in support. Here again is another rarer treatment of the Germans as opposing seamen rather than cardboard Huns. As with many war films  unless they are deliberately semidocumentary the real horrors of injuries and damages are toned down. Overall a very good film . One of the few sea battle genre.".

	schema:headline " A rather disappointing film in spite of its fidelity to history";
	schema:reviewBody "A largely historical accurate depiction of the events surrounding the first major naval battle of the Second World War this is nevertheless a rather disappointing film. The script by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger is not up to the high standard that the set for themselves in the 1940s as it is quite badly structured. The last 45 minutes which take place in Uruguay are particularly dull. Very little of interest happens after the battle itself is fought. On the bright side it is a beautiful looking and very well directed film which makes excellent use of real naval vessels rather than sets. Most notably the HMNZS Achilles is used to represent itself though by then it was the INS Delhi. It was decommissioned and promptly scrapped in 1978. The first half an hour is told from the German perspective aboard the Deutschlandclass pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee and it is most certainly the strongest part of the film. Had the rest of it been of the same high quality I would have undoubtedly given it full marks. This was the Archers' most financially successful film but it's far from their best work I'm afraid.The most interesting character is by far the Graf Spee's commanding officer Captain Hans Langsdorff played in a brilliant performance by Peter Finch in what unfortunately amounted to little more than an extended cameo. After the first half an hour he is barely seen until towards the end of the film which is a serious mistake. It is a slightly bizarre decision on Powell and Pressburger's part after giving him so much prominence in the early part of the film. Langsdorff is a good honourable and decent man who serves Germany loyally but he takes no pleasure in attacking British merchant navy ships. He develops a rapport with Captain Patrick Dove of MS Africa Shell played very well by Bernard Lee as he treats his prisoners with respect and humanity in accordance with international law. In a great scene he has his men give them Christmas decorations to make their confinement more bearable something which is nicely contrasted by the fact that he attacks another British ship moments later. Langsdorff does not hesitate to release the prisoners when the Graf Spee arrives in neutral Uruguay. At the end of the film after he has scuttled his ship Captain Dove tells him that he has earned the respect and admiration of everyone who has come into contact with him including his enemies. This is one of the best scenes and there is a real sense that Langsdorff and Dove may have been friends if they were not fighting on opposite sides. At its best their relationship was reminiscent of that of Clive Candy and Theo KretschmarSchuldorff in The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp. The film ends before Langsdorff committed suicide on December 20 1939 only one week after the titular battle.Speaking of the battle what is depicted on screen is done so very effectively but I felt as if we were only getting half of the story. Never once do we see Langsdorff and his crew's perspective only that of the crews of the Ajax the Achilles and the Exeter and the prisoners aboard the Graf Spee. A major naval battle of this kind is almost like a chess match on a large scale and it is hard to become terribly involved in it if only one side's reactions are shown. This is especially disappointing since Langsdorff is clearly a brilliant strategist as is his British counterpart Commodore Henry Harwood so it would have been very interesting to see the perspective of the two opposing sides as was often the case in later war films. Anthony Quayle is an excellent actor but he is more or less wasted in the role of Harwood who only really comes into his own during the comparatively short battle sequence. He has far more screen time than Finch but far less interesting material. John Gregson is mostly a bore as Captain Frederick Bell but in his film debut Jack Gwillim is very good as Captain Edward Parry. It has a good supporting cast such as Christopher Lee Roger Delgado Michael Goodliffe Ian Hunter John Le Mesurier Patrick Macnee Nigel Stock and Anthony Newley but the script only provides Finch and Bernard Lee with a particular opportunity to stand out and neither of them were in it as much as I would have liked.Overall this film has a great deal of unrealised potential. It could have made for an engrossing battle of wits between highly skilled opponents but sadly it was not to be.".

	schema:reviewBody "This meticulous film reenacts the first major sea battle of World War II the dramatic engagement between the German pocket battleship Graf Spee and three smaller British cruisers off the coast of South America and it's equally dramatic aftermath. When the battledamaged Graf Spee steamed into the neutral Uruguayan port of Montevideo it became front page news all over the world and everybody wondered how the story would end. Would the Graf Spee allow herself to be interned in Uraguay would she attempt to escape out to sea or would she fight the British again? And if she did choose to fight just how powerful a force did the British have left to face her? At the time the film was produced there were no longer any warships resembling the Graf Spee so the producers made do with the U.S. Navy's heavy cruiser USS Salem. The real Graf Spee was actually a great deal more powerful than the USS Salem. The Graf Spee could outrun any warship she didn't outgun and she outgunned any warship she couldn't outrun. For those reasons the Graf Spee was more than a match for the three British warships that faced her. It was as though three terriers were taking on an angry bear.One noteworthy aspect of this film is that the producers listed the ships in the credits as though they were members of the cast. It was entirely appropriate that they should have done so since this is essentially a story of ships and the seamen who manned them. It is also noteworthy that two of the ships in the cast HMS Cumberland and HMIS Delhi formerly HMNZS Achilles were actually present during the original events. As for the original HMS Exeter it was a tribute to the professionalism of her crew that she actually survived the tremendous battering depicted in the film she was hit by seven of Graf Spee's 11inch shells. Unfortunately she was sunk by the Japanese in 1942 and the survivors of her gallant crew spent the remainder of the war living under conditions similar to those depicted in The Bridge Over the River Kwai.".

	schema:reviewBody "Filmed in colour which was very unusual for a British war movie of that era this was a basically decent take on WW2 naval conflict.It's nice to sea genuine warships of the period in their full spectacular and menacing beauty instead of the usual tacky and implausible models. Just checkout the 'seabattle' of 'In Harm's Way' to sea how badly it could have been done.Lots of fine British character actors pop up and do their stuff. Anthony Quayle John Gregson Patrick Macnee and there are many more. There are also plenty of nice little details that often get overlooked such as the gunmuzzles that become smokeblackened after use. The actual battle sequences tend to look a little hokey nowadays with the splashes of nearby shellfalls resembling a bucket of pelted water. Still the destruction and confusion arising from direct hits are believable enough.Some commentators smirk at the stiff upperlippedness of the characters portrayed but these attitudes are in fact very authentic. It was terribly bad form to lapse into any kind of emotional display in those times of repressed Englishness never mind the histrionics often wrongly depicted of Americans. People had a far greater sense of national obligation in those days and lamenting one's personal losses implied a lack of proportion everyone was suffering one way and another. A recentlyinterviewed former nurse who served in a warcasualty hospital remarked how despite the most appalling injuries she had ever seen no man ever swore or cried out in pain. The only exclamation of distress she ever heard was a whispered 'ohdear'. There's a scene in the much more gritty 'Cruel Sea' in which a crew member whilst writing a letter to his wife is informed of her death in the blitz. He responds simply by saying 'I think I'll just go on deck for a while'. Everyone learnt to have a much greater sense of selfdiscipline and forbearance. They kept a good face and grieved in private. Unlike the wimps of today. Just look at the antics of a modern premierleague footballer who gets trippedup.Another criticism has been levied about its predominantly British take on events. But what would one expect in 1956? The bleedingheart liberal apologists hadn't taken over the media by then. In fact Finch's Langsdorff and the Graff Spee crew in general offer a pretty sympathetic presentation of those who fought at sea for the most despicable regime of modern time. Let's not forget that this powerful warship was employed in sinking defenceless merchant vessels. When it came up against determined though still inferiorgunned adversaries Langsdorff's response was to cut and run. Bearing in mind that the Battle is depicted from a British perspective and that they knew almost nothing of the mindset of their enemies I'd say it is sufficiently evenly balanced for the story and the drama.I also like the way we patrol with the fleet as the dawn breaks on a clear morning. We see the sky brightening and the sun slowly rise as the aboardship dramas unfold.If I have a grumble about the movie it concerns the postMontevideo section. Far too much of the drama is given over to the rogue reporter. His relentless hyperbole jars with the steadfast British understatement that dominated the first half of the action. But I suppose as American money funded it and an American warship had been borrowed to play the Graff Spee they must be allowed in somewhere.Still there's much to like and admire in this golden oldie from topdrawer actors excellent script beautiful photography and genuine warships of the time as well as a largely authentic slice of history. Not many movies can boast all of these things. Just checkout U571.Recommended.".

Officials at either port won't let him on land so he has to remain a passenger on the Ferry.Now for the antagonist Orson Welles as Captain Hart an uptight prissy jerk that runs the boat with a iron fist. Both Conrad and Hart couldn't be more different and much of the film has them at odds both at sea and on land. But let's not forget the love interest  Sylvia Sims as Liz a beautiful too young for Jurgens missionary with a bevy of orphans can't help but love the grungy loner who has a heart of gold like any scruffy anti hero.Jurgens makes for a decent lead while Orson Welles provides an annoying British accent sounding like an imitation of an uptight character meant to be hated by the audience and the people around him. Although there are moments when he becomes a real human being mostly as he's pushed by Conrad who eventually takes command when pirates hijack after a formidable storm.The Asian locations are beautiful and the direction by Lewis Gilbert THE SPY WHO LOVED ME flows. And despite a somewhat clunky script not sure whether to be a comedy romance or adventure by the end you'll want to spend more time on that boat a cozy enough place to be stuck without a paddle.For More Reviews www.cultfilmfreaks.com".

The story benefits from location shooting but is let down by a dominating performance from Orson Welles as the ship's captain while everybody else takes the story seriously and give appropriately serious performances Welles is under the misconception that he's shooting a broad comedy and his over the top performance is quite farcical.The film's main strength lies in the underrated Curt Jurgens who makes for an understated lead. He's an underdog character a man without a home who looks like a tramp for the most part and yet his heroism shines through as the story goes on. The tale is rather stodgy with pedestrian direction and a definite lack of suspense although it picks up with some good stuff at the climax. The interesting supporting cast includes Sylvia Syms as the love interest Noel Purcell as an engineer future actor Roy Chiao of INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM fame as a pirate and the great and hulking Milton Reid as a really nasty piece of work.".

While its good that you enjoyed the movie I am surprised at how most people here are overlooking some of the pretty terrible choices. I will be going through what I thought worked and what kept me from enjoying the movie. Needless to say MASSIVE SPOILERS AHEAD.The good I like the plot for the most part. Although I find the idea of a train being humanity last home extremely weird it makes for a nice backdrop. The tone of the movie reminds me a lot of The Hunger Games. Chris Evans does pretty good. The wagons themselves have amazing character. The Art Director should be praised the most out of the entire film crew.The bad Well let me sum it up in questions. Questions keeping me from loving this 1. Why divide the train into classes? This makes no sense. The train ecosystem would function fine with some rules regarding population control. 2. Their great plan is to have a regular uprising to kill off people and keeping the population down? WHAT? See my first point. 3. They used to eat people and babies but are now disgusted by eating protein bars made by cockroaches? How does that work? And furthermore 4 WHERE did all those bloody cockroaches come from? 5 If you've invented perpetual motion why the hell use it in a train? Why not use it to power a generator in a camp or heat a underground city? The train is death on tracks with ice regularly blocking the path. 6 Why is everyone on this train ready to kill? Seriously 90 of EVERYONE is ready to throw down here. 7 People take loosing their limbs SHOCKINGLY well in this movie. Like it's just a flesh wound really. 8 What the hell happened with that one bad guy who got stabbed through his guts and choked? He just gets up? Why did the korean guy stop his girl from stabbing him? And the korean girl later misses him by 78 shots? Furthermore Tilda Swinton gets a knife through the leg but walks fine right afterwards.9 Those weird antics of the characters. The woman in the yellow dress licking her blood off her fingers. Tilda Swinton with her strange comedic performance although I did like the character I found it a bit distracting that incredibly weird Korean couple acting all over the place things like the masked guy just smiling at Evans when they are sitting down. Sometimes I felt like I was watching Charlie and the chocolate factory. 10 The starved people of the tail takes out an army of axe wielding fighters with night vision? After apparently yelling for help through the entire train and a kid lighting a torch and running up to them in no time? Stretching it thin movie! 11 The soldiers had bullets but they weren't using them at the ONE PLACE they needed bullets? Are you serious?? 12 The shootout between Chris Evans and what I can only assume was Terminator. On opposite sides of the train probably 1000ft from each other. Sniping with a submachine gun. Through a blizzard. Nice aim there fellas. 13 Mr. Terminator shooting his comrades all the time. Seriously. What was to be gained from that? He did it several times. Who is this guy?? 14 The only way the train can function is to stuff small kids down small holes to keep the engine running? Really? Was the train designed to stuff small kids down there or did it just appear to be the perfect solution? How convenient. 15 The wagon closest to the engine is the RAVECLUB where all the freaks go to party? Incidentally the elementary school is next to the slaughterhouse.16 There is no policy on drugs on this finely tuned train? Everyone just goes buck wild with this incredibly potent drug next to the engine room? And furthermore... 17 The drug of choice is basically C4? And it just lies around everywhere  again  next to the engine room? 18 Why not pay attention to what the korean guy is doing to open the doors and then open them themselves instead of having him slow them down? 19 The people with axes putting fish blood on their weapons before fighting? That was random. 20 The other wagons are TOTALLY unaffected by the explosion in the first wagons. Wow. They don't really notice until they derail. What a masterfully crafted train. 21 I know it fits with his story but did Mr. Evans really need to sacrifice his arm to pull that kid out? He could probably stop the machine with something else than a limb and take better care of that child. 22 The people who jumped off the train still haven't been covered up by snow after 15 years in a neverending blizzard?Those were some of the things that stopped me from loving this movie. It just got too dumb. There was definitely something here and I feel this could have become an excellent movie with more thought put into it. It came off extremely unrealistic. And in scifi it's all about fooling the audience into thinking it could have happened. That's the science part.All in all though  probably an entertaining movie if you'e not a nitpicker like me. Thankfully a lot of you aren't EDIT Someone corrected me in that the couple were korean and that one of the bad guys never takes a bullet like I thought he did. Sorry about that but it still seems far fetched.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was really looking forward to this film. I love post apocalyptic stories I didn't think it would be amazing but I certainly thought it would be better than this. I have never made a review on here before I have only rated filmsTV shows. But I felt compelled to after watching this and noting the major numerous gaping holes in this film. WARNING SPOILER ALERT!!1 If this Wilford guy knew this C4 gas or whatever was going to turn the world into an ice age why didn't he do more than just build this train? He talks about this engine being eternal  so why didn't he use it to power an underground city with actual space to move?2 Who maintains the train and the tracks? In 18 years no repairs have needed to be made? None whatsoever? In this post apocalyptic ice age there is no damage? I don't think so!3 Why was there no explanation as to how this engine actually works? Literally no explanation whatsoever. 4 The poor need to be routinely killed by allowing them to uprise so they can be slaughtered? What kind of idea is that. Why not suggest a child policy?5 Why was a class system needed at all on this train. No explanation as to why they couldn't be put to work to be productive members of this ridiculous train society!6 Who were the bad guys who dressed up with night vision goggles?

Do they have a back story?7 How did the fire reach from the back of the train to the carriage where they were fighting so quickly?8 Why was Tilda swinton who played mason stabbed with a knife in the leg but could walk fine in the next scenes? And why did she randomly take her teeth out? And what were he weird little speeches about?9 There are apparently first class economy and the freeloader sections if the train?

How dumb was that?!15 Why did that bad guy live through so much? We literally saw him die. We saw it happen. He was stabbed in the side and died. But all of a sudden he stands up and walks and pulls out the knife no problem and has enough energy to have a full on fight for no apparent reason. 16 Who was the woman in the yellow coat? What was the point of her?17 Why were all the people from the nightclub suddenly wielding axes and chains? Because the two Koreans stole their drugs? Really? Why is everyone so excited to kill on this train that is the last hope for humankind? Why couldn't the girl kill anyone whilst shooting about 8 times into that crowd?18 Why did Wilford want to give up his job as engine commander. He says it's was because he was old but he only looked 5060. What was so demanding about sitting there that meant he couldn't do it anymore?19 Why did that kid ignore Curtis like he was brainwashed and walk into that weird engine thing that popped out? And what was he doing in the engine thing? And why was he in a cupboard? And why did he come out at that moment? 20 Why did Curtis chop off his arm to save a kid when they were about to blow up the train anyway? Why not use one of the weapons that were around a lot of the film to put in between the gears to take him out? Or not bother at all. 21 Why would they blow up the train? For what reason? What possible good could come from that? Curtis had the power in his hands and he could have made this little bizarre train world a better place but nope  let's derail the train and kill everyone with an explosion!22 What the hell are that teenage girl and little boy supposed to do now? She just killed everyone on the train and if the cold doesn't kill her and that boy then the polar bear will probably kill them! And again no breath! It's meant to be freezing cold and they couldn't stretch themselves to make the actors' breath visible! Poor!On the plus side the garden and aquarium sections looked nice...DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM!".

	onyx:emotionText "I was really looking forward to this film. I love post apocalyptic stories I didn't think it would be amazing but I certainly thought it would be better than this. I have never made a review on here before I have only rated filmsTV shows. But I felt compelled to after watching this and noting the major numerous gaping holes in this film. WARNING SPOILER ALERT!!1 If this Wilford guy knew this C4 gas or whatever was going to turn the world into an ice age why didn't he do more than just build this train? He talks about this engine being eternal  so why didn't he use it to power an underground city with actual space to move?2 Who maintains the train and the tracks? In 18 years no repairs have needed to be made? None whatsoever? In this post apocalyptic ice age there is no damage? I don't think so!3 Why was there no explanation as to how this engine actually works? Literally no explanation whatsoever. 4 The poor need to be routinely killed by allowing them to uprise so they can be slaughtered? What kind of idea is that. Why not suggest a child policy?5 Why was a class system needed at all on this train. No explanation as to why they couldn't be put to work to be productive members of this ridiculous train society!6 Who were the bad guys who dressed up with night vision goggles? Why were they so ready to kill? Which class were they a part of? Do they have a back story?7 How did the fire reach from the back of the train to the carriage where they were fighting so quickly?8 Why was Tilda swinton who played mason stabbed with a knife in the leg but could walk fine in the next scenes?

Once the review process has exhausted the fans and people who haven't seen or heard of the comic are reviewing it I expect it'll fall like a stone.The major flaws as I see them spoiler alert!. The whole concept of a train being the last salvation of mankind on a frozen planet is just beyond belief. Where does the train stop for servicing to it's undercarriage etc. without any stations? Who maintains the track? An engine that runs on magic as much as anything! Why not make it nuclear or at least something believable. If you were to set up a society in a closed environment why wouldn't everyone have a purpose with controlled breeding rather than be lugging around many people with no contribution to the whole. Why would you engineer a rebellion to control population? There are many better ways. Why would you expect some rebel to want your top job doing things your way? The very word rebel suggests that a change of system is wanted.Major flaws aside there are other issues with the film. The characters are not believable. They belong in the comic it's based on. Nobody has made any effort to translate them to film or realised that some adjustments are even necessary. Film requires a different approach and nobody who made this film understands that. A great example of how to do it right is Dredd. This is a great example of how to do it wrong. The film tries to open up great philosophical issues but fails to do so due to the setting they are working in ie a comic book. You continuously think that none of this is real and so pay no attention to the great moral dilemmas they are trying to foist on you. It's akin to being lectured by a 10 year old.On top of the major flaws there are many minor ones. I'll just give the one example of the hero of the piece stuffing his arm in a moving machine to save one child didn't bother to look for anything better suited to the task such as a steel bar whilst then dooming that child to death with everyoneelse.The one redeeming quality of the film is it's well made. It's not remotely enough to save it from being a turkey though.".

We witness how completely the children absorbed the doctrine of Wilford. The train manager became a benevolent deity the system is never questioned and the train must go on forever. The teacher is a sycophant very much like Mason. What future do the children have if they are not allowed to think critical?Second key scene Wilford's monologue when he explains how sacrifices have to be made only by others i.e. the lower class. If the system can only continue by murder then mankind survives by inhuman means although Wilford sees himself not as the leader who created the train and the system but as just another cogwheel in the machine. Therefore he expects that a younger man might replace him when he is too old without any change to the system. He cannot imagine any alternative but others can. In conclusion what matters is that the train must be stopped somehow to get out of this treadmill. Other reviewers have asked is it possible to survive in the cold outside wouldn't it be safer to keep going with the train. I think they fell right into the trap here that the movie makers prepared. Because just like the train is going in circles returning every year to the same places we are living our lives in circles safe but in a society that loses its social qualities as you can see quite often in the treatment of children or elderly people for example. The revolution as the film makers describe it wants to break the circle and start a new life that may be less safe but challenging and more human. I think people who ask wouldn't they freeze to death outside? take the allegory too literal again. The frozen world outside represents the unknown something you take careful glimpses at from the window but whether it's 5 degrees below zero or 25 is hardly the point. The train itself was a better allegory than a ship or an airplane because these do not strictly stay on the same tracks when they sail or fly around the planet. The polar bear at the end shows that life outside is possible but one must try and face the unknown instead of continuing the same old evil.I liked 'Snowpiercer' a lot as it gives much food for thought but I wouldn't call it a flawless masterpiece voted 8 of 10. The killer shooting through the window the decadent upper class passengers in swimming pools or the traitor among the lower class passengers are too much of movie clichs. The question of how food is produced was answered much more terrifyingly in 'Soylent Green' decades before in 'Snowpiercer' it was just good enough for a quick shock effect. But don't these little niggles stop you from watching this very interesting movie.".

In an such extreme climate some part of the rails are bound to be somewhat damaged. 5. At the end of the movie they step outside and into the cold harsh weather. And let me just tell you. We call that summer in Norway not an apocalyptic freezing weather.

The peoples behavior wasn't believable either. First of all we need to remember that it was an closed environment and people in the different classes all knew each other. And when after 18 years on this train some of the upperclass people see these dirty bloody and new faces they don't seem to give one single fk. Not one single one of them. And why did Curtis choose to destroy the engine the only thing that was keeping all the people on the train alive to temporarily save one kid? He basically doomed the whole train including the child he just saved. And don't get me started on how he did it jeezez.The list of these What?! moments just goes on and on and on.

Be a shoe.I was pleasantly surprised at how well Korean director Joonho Bong made the transition to this his first English language film because the style and tone of the film still felt entirely Korean despite starring some well known Hollywood actors. I enjoyed this film so much that I ended up watching it twice and that is something I rarely do. Based on the French graphic novel Le Transperceneige written by JeanMarc Rochette Snowpiercer is an ambitious dystopian scifi film that despite having a very absurd premise works really well thanks to Bong's direction. It has some great performances with memorable characters several exciting action scenes mixed with bizarre comedic moments and a thought provoking metaphor on classicism. It is a bleak film but Bong handled the material so well that it kept me engaged and interested. Unfortunately the film does suffer from a rather unconvincing final act but for most of its running time I was so entertained that I wasn't too disappointed.Snowpiercer takes place in 2031 after a failed globalwarming experiment has frozen all of Earth and wiped out all life. The only survivors are the passengers of a super train traveling across the globe with a perpetualmotion engine. Designed by Wilford an engineer who knew the experiment would fail the train has been running for 17 straight years and a social class system has developed as the passengers of the rear end live in extremely poor conditions. Here we are introduced to a young man named Curtis Chris Evans who is trying to come up with a plan to get past all the security guards in order to reach the front section where Wilford is presumed to be. He isn't alone on this quest as most of the passengers are upset for the abuse they've suffered and the extreme poor conditions in which they are forced to live in. A wise old man named Gilliam John Hurt who helped Wilford design the engine has been helping Curtis rally the men together. Curtis's good friend Edgar Jamie Bell is also awaiting the moment to begin their revolution as things begin to get worse once the guards take a few kids away from them. Tanya Octavia Spencer and Andrew Ewen Bremner are among the victims whose children have been taken away from them so they are also eager to attack. The first step of the plan involves freeing Namgoong Song Kangho a prisoner who has a special gift for unlocking the doors to each section but the task won't be easy as the guards will do what it takes to make sure they stay at the rear section of the train.Bong has directed several successful Korean films like The Host and Memories of a Murder and in his first English language film his style remains untouched. Despite having some scenes that borderline in the ridiculous he somehow manages to balance those moments really well. For example there is this huge action scene that he has set up between the rebels and the guards who are awaiting them with axes. The bloody and violent confrontation begins only to be interrupted as the train is approaching a bridge which serves as a landmark for the New Year. The fighting stops for a few seconds as everyone begins the countdown and admires the view of the outside world from inside the train then the violence and mayhem continue. There are several moments like this where Bong perfectly balances these gorgeously crafted choreographed scenes with moments of quirky comedy and twisted sense of humor. The best example of this type of humor comes from the two characters played by Tilda Swinton who is unrecognizable in this film and Alison Pill who are terrific and steal the few scenes they are in. I really loved that classroom scene that felt completely out of place with the dark tail section of the train. I think it was those goofy moments that I enjoyed the most in this film. It was a great sensory experience to get to follow these characters through each section of the train and I have to give Bong credit for his visionary style because as our heroes progress to the front of the train things begin to get more and more bizarre and you never know what to expect. The film is short of being a masterpiece because the final 30 minutes are disappointing but as a social satire Snowpiercer worked better than other recent scifi films like Elysium. It is a very weird and strange film but it is really good and I enjoyed it even more on my second viewing.".

Instead what I ended up getting was one of the best postapocalyptic films I've ever seen. A smooth roller coaster of action and quiet dark dialogue.And don't get me wrong it is another social commentary dystopian film and yes perhaps it's riding The Hunger Games craze just a little bit. But when that riding ends up producing a film of this quality is it a bad thing? And it's not like The Hunger Games invented the idea of alternative future where the poor are trying to usurp the rich people that are controlling them from their towers of ivory. These are both just variations of Orwell's 1984 which draws heavily from the age old tale of the underdog David versus Goliath.It's the execution of an idea that makes or breaks a film and here that execution is nigh flawless. Everything from the design of the train to the Alist cast of actors to the storyline that keeps up the relentless pace but still has time to reflect on the motives histories and moods of the characters.Snowpiercer is simplistic art. It doesn't try to win you over with limitless of details high explosives or flashiness. Rather it takes a central idea and fills it with as much quality as possible. Highly recommended for all fans of science fiction out there.".

Don't even think about filing a complaint with the conductor's blackclad goon squad they don't take kindly to dissent. But that's not the worst of it you'll never get off this train since it comprises the only habitable environment left on earth after global warming countermeasures triggered a new ice age.While the setting of Bong Joonho's film incorporates a few original ideas much will seem familiar to the postapocalyptic film audience. Society is divided between the first class minority with their fine tailors and cocktail parties and the downtrodden masses with little more than the rags on their backs they can call their own. Of course revolution is in order but the plan for regicide will require a trip down the length of the train with a few bloody battles and the discovery of what life is really like on the other side filling in the remainder of the story.Class struggle is naturally the topic of so many scifi films from classics like Fahrenheit 451 and 1984 to contemporary derivatives such as District 9 and Elysium. So taking up such a topic is a little like opening a hamburger joint  you really have to do it well and ideally provide your own twist to have any hope of impressing your clients.Unfortunately Snowpiercer follows the triedandtrue formulas a little too closely to inspire and it's hard not to feel like we've been served a Big Mac of a film. There are caricatures not characters the hero who doubts himself the naive sidekick who worships his idol the wise octogenarian guiding the flock. There are even a couple of videogame references thrown in for the kids in the forms of a martial arts expert and the boss who comes back from the dead. We share in the characters' wonder about the extravagant lives of passengers in the front cars but little else drives the plot. The script reads like something written by a nonnative speaker quite honestly and as with other films that aspire to the demands of an international box office the writers settle for brevity simplicity and imitation where tactfulness and originality were called for.I didn't see Chris Evans in Captain America but I imagine that your appraisal of his acting in that movie might go a long way in determining whether you like his role in this one. In my mind Evans does little more in Snowpiercer than dutifully recite his lines and chop down some bad guys but judging from box office returns these days that's not necessarily a bad thing.For those who want to step outside the boundaries of Hollywood I heartily recommend you skip this film in favor of Bong's earlier Korean works especially Barking Dogs Never Bite Memories of Murder and Mother. Those films are wonderfully crafted windows onto Korean society that touch upon real divides between class and generation instead of the roughly hewn metaphors we endure in Snowpiercer.".

These people also weren't concerned with the functionality of this microcosm and some even said it would have ruined the film if it was explained. Sweet Jesus lord Buddha Allah Yahweh!I hope these people are never in charge of this fictitious realm that indulges psychotic caste behaviour. We'd all be dead in a week or they would be and humanity would have fighting chance. Which is what this movie implies. Do not fight know your place and shut up. Although the balance of power makes absolutely no sense in film. The well off out number the unfortunate at least 21. Which in a balanced system of hierarchy doesn't happen. There need to be more workers to provide for the upper class. This didn't exist in this story. The overall end game is to maintain humanity in a suspended state with rebellion as regulation to preserve a class system. Know your place. However there is no economic system presented to maintain it. How they select the uppers and the lowers isn't explained. Which brings me back to the people who would find this movie profound. Lack of understanding for the more important self. The scientific laws on this train do not apply. Logic mathematics physics chemistry basically anyone who made it to grade nine should see canon sized holes in this story. Leave aside the perpetual motion machine. A train can't contain industrialized mechanics for a recycling system. Sources have to be introduced for a human organism to be supported. There would have to be scientific control in closed system other than a woman reading a book while the oranges grow. Where is the cockroach harvesting car? The aquarium car must be maintained by the sushi chef. The cleaning products must come from the ammonia produced by recycling urine. The bar gets its alcohol from the engine fumes or that muck the kid was cleaning out. The track that never cracks could be maintained by.... I've run out magical solutions. The idea behind this movie is to demonstrate we are all flawed and try to maintain order in what we think society should be but it doesn't embrace those flaws. It ignores them and does whatever it can to fight those flaws with no common good. It takes for granted how things are done and who is doing them. Everyone is in it for themselves and will rip apart anyone who gets in their selfish way. If you truly found this movie to be good you are already on that train at the end of humanity and you will not survive that way. It means you already take for granted your own life and all the little white lies you tell yourself are as big as that landscape out of that trains window. That train should have stopped and as someone suggested use the engine to build a sustainable society instead of bombing head on into oblivion with no end in sight. Ultimately this movie could have ended no other way with a failed attempt at maintaining a snooty greedy childish society with no responsibility but to its own anal stage of development".

	schema:reviewBody "No pacing no decent dialogue no characterisation no decent action. No surprises. It's completely pointless and nonsensical.There are so many plot holes and impossibilities even within the world of the initial premise that right from the first line you understand that the only way you can get anything out of this stupidity is to follow along with the heavyhanded allegorical message. Unfortunately the film never waivers from the allegory even when you get the message after ten minutes. Still waiting for plot surprises? Sorry there won't be any.

It's completely pointless and nonsensical.There are so many plot holes and impossibilities even within the world of the initial premise that right from the first line you understand that the only way you can get anything out of this stupidity is to follow along with the heavyhanded allegorical message. Unfortunately the film never waivers from the allegory even when you get the message after ten minutes. Still waiting for plot surprises? Sorry there won't be any.

For those of you uninterested in topics like '1984' and 'Animal Farm' watch this film for a hazard course in understanding the human condition.

And we see the evolution of civilisation from simple beginnings to science education quality luxury then hedonism wastefulness and eventual demise in exactly that order.All of that can be overlooked however if you're just the average moviegoer who simply wants a good story with a hero an adventure and an end goal. In which case I say the film is a good one but nothing special in that respect. Certainly there were parts where I thought eh? until it clicked later that it was all part of the Director's greater cinematic design.But for the arty film student types this film is sure to be the topic of many many essays for years to come.Clearly every part of the film was deliberate  every shot every line of script every item in the background. It was true art. None of that quickbuck profitincentive Hollywood stuff.In conclusion I recommend this film to everyone particularly people who want to learn something or gain some insight from what they watch. For the everyday movielover go into this with an open mind and have a really long think about how you can compare it to the world today.Top stuff 1010".

It takes great genius to present something as insane as the plot of Snowpiercer.This film will be remembered analyzed and revered for a long long time.

I can't really say anything more than that since saying anything beside the trailer would be a dead giveaway but really wow. I honestly don't know how the director's unique style and choices would get to the American audience but as a person who enjoys this strange and beautiful execution of director Bong this movie fulfilled everything i want from Bong's film an intellectual Sifi movie.

Well if Snowpiercer is not such an absolute masterpiece I do believe it's the best reiteration of the same concept that made Lang's film so unique  asking questions about the condition of mankind in a futuristic society and how it does and does not evolve as compared with current times. It's good that not all nearblockbuster scale scifi movies do not come out of Hollywood anymore. Snowpiercer is based on a longforgotten 70's French graphic novel. The Korean director got his hands on a bootleg translation in a Seoul bookshop while filming The Host and got totally hooked. The end product is a FrenchKorean production in the making of which one of the authors of the original graphic novel got directly involved. The plot is simple  ecologist freaks have pushed governments to unleash a gas in the atmosphere to control global warming this proved so effective that the world is now a standalone snowcovered giant ice cap. The only survivors are all aboard a revolutionary train that goes on and on making loops around the world. It's like Noah's Ark but including the politics that come with it  first class second class workers fraudsters the ticket is your fate  for generations. And the consequences are extreme to such and extent that you can't conceive. Prepare to be shocked at times. Imagine the vertical multistoreyed humanity of Lang's Metropolis the horizontal way. Some of the tail section fraudsters decide to rebel against their condition and progress to the head car of the train regardless of the risks. Every car they go through bears its grotesque and mindbending surprises. And tells us more about how this society actually works and what it relies on. This film has style. Even though it reminds of Gilliam see 12 monkeys and Matsumoto Galaxy Express there is real personality and originality. CGI is limited to a few breathtaking scenes that really add up to the storyline. Acting is mostly excellent especially by Ed Harris and John Hurt. But most importantly this film triggers reflection soulsearching and debate like true SciFi gems should. Unlike most Hollywood movies it is not Manichaean  the story and morals are complex and debatable. You heart keeps swinging for scene to scene as you learn more. The ending asks a lot of questions. All in all when the end credits start rolling it's a film you want to rewatch not because you haven't understood but because you want to understand more and experience more.".

Beyond that the plot is something a child might come up with completely unsupported by any kind of common sense or science this train hurdles onward through snow as if somehow the only way to survive cold is in a moving train.For me something like an underground shelter might make this movie a lot more believable. The idea they are on some magic train piercing through the snow is just stupid. Trains don't actually really just go throw thick snow and why would you have to? Why not take whatever powers the train and just make an underground shelter with it? The movie never really explains why anyone would want to stay on the train in such bad conditions nor why anyone would want all those people on the train since they serve no real use or purpose. The entire poor vs wealthy uprising vibe they have going makes no sense because they don't need the poor people there to run the train why waste food on them and risk losing control? More importantly though why perpetually drive a train through snow and constantly risk derailing while trapping yourself in a small space with limited resources. On top of all that there is no way a track would survive a massive climate shift like this. It would be covered or destroyed by such dramatic climate shift as well as face constant avalanches.It's like the movie Speed on a train with a climate apocalypse setting but on a real low budget without good directing much worse acting and with a less believable storyline.It should be rated around 34 but for some reason this is some weird cult following boosting the rating of this horrible movie. It's much worse than The Colony which made no sense either but still made vastly more sense than a perpetual snow train.The only thing it has going for it is that it's so weird and makes so little sense you may keep watching it in hope of closure which you will not get.".

Nothing deep or thoughtful happens in this movie. NOTHING.You can read any review here on this movie scored 3 or lower and get tons of good ideas on how to NOT DO A MOVIE but for my own amusement I will list my own top ten  or twenty or more. You could basically do this all day long .1 No guard posts are set up even though there is open rioting going on. Oh wait. I forgot about the new holiday policy on the train.2The stupidity of having to control your population by having riots killing off people regularly is... well at least you save on condoms right? 3 After FIVE MINUTES of massacre in the tunnel literally everybody is still alive and can call out for torch lights being carried Olympian style through the entire length of the train to arrive there five more minutes later to still find everybody intact and in fighting shape. Oh and that torch obviously had babies on its way to the fray. Cute. 4 A full store cabin of foodstuff yet not a single cart carrying actual livestock. I am guessing the train is actually piggybacked on a cattle trail. Made immune to cold. Yepp sounds about right. Makes more sense than the engine being a perpetual motion thing anyway. 5 Luring your enemies into your child's classroom only for the PREGNANT teacher drawing out an Uzi to assassinate them is PURE GENIUS! I always knew teachers had a dark streak much like clowns and finally giving them the chance to act on their frustrations... WELL DONE!6 Gilliam works from inside the tail section to instigate riots to help the population control. So we are to believe that a guy gave his arm to cannibalize on willingly to safe a baby in order to stick to a lifetime of poverty and dirt in the tail section to regularly send people to their death? Lolwut? Oh wait I forgot. Evereybody on this train is a mental patient so all is well and everybody is acting normally within their respective limits.7 I don't think I can do more than five. My eye is starting to twitch nervously just thinking of writing more about this train wreck of a movie.Overall the entire movie gives a lasting impression of a feverish dream while being on a bad trip.And in the end when everybody except two have killed them self off you see them meeting a polar bear in the Himalayas and you know everything is going to be well The polar bear will eat those two too and finally the entire train of stupid has come to a halt. Thank you Mister Polar Bear. Well done!".

	schema:headline " Makes Elysium look like Sesame Street.";
	schema:reviewBody "If you thought that Neill Blomkamp's Elysium was a bleak enough dystopia brace yourself for Bong Joonho's latest film. Snowpiercer is what George Orwell would write if he wanted to set 1984 aboard the mad Blaine the Mono from Stephen King's The Waste Lands. Grim and fatalistic this picture packs a chilly compelling punch.The apocalypse has already happened with the planet transformed into a frozen block of ice over the next twenty years. The last dregs of mankind sought refuge aboard an evermoving train the titular Snowpiercer barreling through the icy landscape. The central conflict of Snowpiercer deals of course with a major class struggle with most of the refugees hunkering in the ghettoized tail section of the train. The privileged few live in the front cars I'm sure any similarities to the basic concept of the bus boycotts that started the civil rights movement are intentional and the ragged masses congregating in the rear are sick of the oppression and rebellion begins to foment.The de facto Everyman leader is Curtis Chris Evans a taciturn fellow who quietly waits for the right time to strike. In the meantime he acts as a big brother figure to his friend Edgar an eager Jamie Bell while enjoying camaraderie with his fellow tailies including sweetnatured mother Tanya Octavia Spencer an unexpected but wonderful addition to a dystopian drama and wizened elder Gilliam John Hurt always expected and always welcome in a dystopian drama. Almost immediately this feels like a futuristic retelling of a drama set on a train bound for Auschwitz.Indeed any time the boat is rocked Gestapolike representatives from the front come to admonish the poor huddled masses. They are headed by Mason a wickedly overthetop Tilda Swinton who might very well be the most fiery character in the film who seems to relish in her duties which include forcing miscreants to shove their extremities into the frigid wastes while praising the allpowerful Wilford the Big Brother figure of this story who inhabits the very front of the engine. Wilford also seems to order the cherrypicking of certain tailie children never to return. Eventually Tanya's son is taken which sparks the revolution which encompasses the first half of the film with vicious Oldboyesque brawls and rapturous moments of rebellion there's one scene involving a kid running through darkness with a fiery torch I swear all it needed was a Vangelis score to complete it!. Once they have gained the upper hand the rebels enlist the help of an druggedup Korean engineer Kangho Song and his daughter to help them in their quest for the front.Snowpiercer is beautifully imaginative with its rather simplistic story and indeed Bong Joon ho gets to assemble a hodgepodge of dystopian bleakness and utopian bliss. Full credit to the set designers for creating distinct levels the further up the train our heroes go. And indeed the Holocaust references really do hit home as the film goes on. One car for instance involves children being indoctrinated about how great their glorious leader Wilford is with a Hitler Youthesque sort of rigmarole. Indeed the fact that the cheeriest spot in the entire train is the potential source for future atrocity and oppression is made abundantly clear and the pregnant propagandaspewing teacher a beamingly insane Alison Pill is ten times more terrifying than the axetoting guards sent to subdue the revolt.Chris Evans makes for a wonderfully stoic protagonist and even though the role could easily fall into bland territory I feel that his inherent Americanness that made him a wonderful choice for a certain Marvel hero hearkens back to the days of Charlton Heston. That said he gets a heartfelt soliloquy in the end that stands as his finest bit of acting to date. The rest of the ensemble fleshes out their characters quite wonderfully special mention must be made to Swinton's slimy Goebbelsesque surrogate Spencer's livedin dignity that aided her so much in Fruitvale Station and the appearance of a certain actor at the very end that puts a face to Big Brother at last.There is naught a dull moment in Snowpiercer by the halfway mark so much has been packed in and yet at the same time it never feels too much. Harvey Weinstein wanted to cut twenty minutes of footage from the film and add a voiceover. Snowpiercer like Blade Runner thirty years before isn't as inaccessible to audiences as one might think. It knows exactly what it is exactly what it wants to be and exactly how to show it. It may lack the spitshine polish of Blade Runner but it makes up for it in sheer grit.".

Or maybe he was a liability.I'll back that up with his famous line he's sniveling by the way and you know what? Babies taste best....sniffle...sniffle. I'm a fan of the post apocalyptic stuff and I think it's almost impossible to make a film of this genre less than mediocre.Okay so this Wilford guy Ed Harris invents a perpetual motion engine for a train and wants to ride around the world on it until the end of time because the world is frozen by a geoengineering disaster.Good for him.He brings a bunch of people with him from very rich to dirt poor. It's up to him who gets on the train though as it is under his strict control.This is where my issues with the film start. Why have poor people on the train at all? Especially if you're going to steal all of their possessions and make them cannabalize themselves?No matter what they'll deplete resources and have the capacity to harm you and your rich friends by getting angry and revolting.This plot hole makes the story pointless.Moving forward Captain America begins his march of death up the train cars and starts fighting with the storm troopers. Right then I thought why don't the powers that be just unhook the car from the rest of the train? Let it slide off the tracks into oblivion. Problem solved! That way the rich people can get back to partying in the night club or whatever it was that they liked to do.Roll the credits!!!! We have the most mediocre Short Film Ever! Last but not least the ending was ridiculous. It's supposed to be so cold no one can survive outside yet the woman and her child walk off the train after it crashes and don't freeze.Sheesh this may be the BIGGEST plot hole in history. You invent a perpetual motion engine for a train yet you don't know the temperature outside? Right then I knew I'd been totally had. Not had like in the twist of say 'The Sixth Sense' but had in the way someone had picked my pocket of 10 dollars.If you watch the movie fast forward through all monologuedialogue and get to the action sequences.".

	schema:reviewBody "Eriprando's A SPIRAL OF MIST is a most curious film for me it typifies the keeping up with the Joneses problems of a declining national cinema in Italy at the end of the '70s. A great cast okay soap opera material and a talented director fell sway to the world's increasing interest in porn.That's a shame because Visconti had rounded up a set of French and Italian thesps who would have done uncle Luchino proud. But why subject them to the ignominy of gratuitous fullnude  sex scenes much in the manner of a trashy American pic see Laurence Olivier in THE BETSY of the period? Because the public in an era of porno chic expected stronger stuff in even their mainstream fare.Visconti was coming off a great local hit the rapekidnap exploitation smash ORCA which generated a successful sequel and is today still much enjoyed on the collector's circuit. With MIST he moved into soap opera territory similar to the work of his uncle's best follower Mauro Bolognini. The story deals with the marital problems of several couples plus their sexual escapades with their servants plus an unresolved and halfhearted murder mystery that all spells night time soap.What took me aback was the clearly compromised injection of sexploitation elements into the narrative. By film's end there are fullfrontal nude scenes by nine 3 of them male of the principal players not extras or bit roles. The glamorous French star Claude Jade who brightened up several Truffaut movies looks positively embarrassed when she is called upon to join hubby Duilio Del Prete in the shower she comically and daintily puts on a shower cap in this scene. Elsewhere her acting is topnotch.Del Prete who flirted ohso briefly with American stardom under the tutelage of Peter Bogdanovich with leads in DAISY MILLER and AT LONG LAST LOVE was experienced in classic sex films opposite such bombastic beauties as Laura Antonelli and Ursula Andress but it still is disconcerting to see him with his Johnson hanging out here. Later in the film his servant girl gives him a hand job and we know Visconti is aiming low.Similarly a very lovely starlet who never made it in films Carole Chauvet is cast as the central character Valeria married to loathsome Marc Porel and seems quite natural au naturel. She gives hubby a blow job later in the film which is an extended scene in closeup merely kept softcore by the careful framing which does not show explicit penetration. Was this artistically necessary or just to appease the fans' basest instincts? Stefano Satta Flores gives perhaps the best male performance as a police inspector investigating Valeria's death while she was out hunting in the woods with Porel. Film presents her fate RASHOMONstyle in a series of many brief flashbacks all punctuated by the yellow rainslicker she's wearing. Picture leaves the solution to this mystery up in the air though Porel is Prime Suspect throughout.Also adding mightily to the prurient content is Martine Brochard a MILF of a nurse who is constantly injecting the cast in the rump with unspecified drugs adding to the general Visconti Sr. atmosphere of decadence. More obviously the beautiful young starlet Eleonora Giorgi pops up in the second half of the film also for purely pulchritudinous purposes.On a sleaze level this adds up to enjoyably trashy entertainment though I for one would have preferred a more straightforward and conclusive handling of the mysterysuspense elements of the story. It probably represents a good example of cultural differences never released in America the film would have been Xrated here all the way yet for a European audience of the late '70s it was probably taken in stride not unlike the way Scandi audiences lapped up family porn comedies such as the BEDSIDE and IN THE SIGN OF... series starring Ole Sltoft.".

Please see HUM DIL DECHUKE SANAM SAAJAN AND SIRF TUM before talking rubbish. Now for the movie...this movie is a remake of a lesser known classic directed by the actress Simi garewal named Rukshat. The film starred Mithun Chakrevotry Sunny Deol Marc Zuber salman Khan and Amisha Kareena Kapoor and Simmi herself Tabu. Jeet is a wonderful movie with outstanding performances. Salman comes almost halfway the movie and he is  well PREM. Sunny indeed gives one of his best performances ever and that says a lot from the actor who made movies like Damini Ghayal Arjun and many more. The soundtrack by Nadee'Shravan has some gems with the evergreen ABHI SAAS LENE KI FURSAT NAHIN HAI KE TUM MERE BAAHON MEIN HO. This is probably the first time you were able to see Sunny dance like he danced here. And about the ending...that's what makes the movie great. Life is not just happiness and sunshine. Sometimes not so nice things happen too. Because I saw Rukshat and rate that movie as a classic and give it 10 out of 10 that's the only reason I am not giving Jeet a 10 but 9 out of 10. By the way there is a small disappointment. They should have had that beauty Tabu in the role of Karishma and Karishma in the special appearance Tabu did.".

I didn't expect a film like this to come under the Nadiadwala Grandson banner I was pleasantly surprised.One of Sunny Deol's career best performances. He is as convincing as ever in his role. I'm very surprised that he didn't win some awards for this. This is one of Karishma Kapoor's best performances she does a great job in the female lead. Salman Khan is good too as is Tabu. Alok Nath is OK and Amrish Puri does a good job as he always does when he plays the role of the villain.I would also like to say that the screenplay is great and it has been edited very well.The music is nothing special. There's only one good song 'dil ka kya karen sahib'.Verdict It is not often you get to see Salman and Sunny in an action movie. It is a must watch. I give it 9.510".

Jeet was one of his best films in the 90s period and it is also where the director makes good use of Sunny's acting. It's also a surprise that Nadiadwala would produce a brilliant film like this because their banner always produces good filmsnot great.The story of the film is quite simple but it is the handling that deserves an applause. The movie exploits themes like sacrifice and loss which is brilliantly portrayed and directed in this film. Kajal and Karan's love story sacrificed for Kajal's dad's sake is quite typical but it is brilliantly showed. Salman Khan's promise to destroy his father and his uncle's criminal empire makes sense. The whole fear Karishma has that Sunny wants to kill Salman and get her back is well portrayed. The team up and a long battle in the end is also well shown. However the ending is extremely sad. It sucks how Sunny Deol's character dies to save Salman but it's good how they Honor Deol after his death.Direction by Raj Kanwar is fabulous he handles the entire film properly despite a few boring initial moments. The SalmanKarishma love story is boring yet funny. The SalmanSunny confrontation and the climax is good. The SunnyKarishma love story is better and the theme loss is brilliantly shown. Raj Kanwar sure knows how to turn a routine romantic action film into a decent one.Sunny Deol is the USP of the film his expressions his wide eyed look and his action is brilliantly portrayed. He steals the show and this film was one of his biggest hits after Ghayal. Salman Khan does a good job his serious act is good but his comedy is not as good as his other films like Judwaa. Karishma Kapoor does a good job and this is one of her first films where she excels. Instead of shrieking in an irritating manner she acts. Alok Nath has little to do but he leaves a mark. Amrish Puri is getting typecast now however he handles the villain act well. Other villains like Mohan Joshi and Deepak Shirke do an average job they are extremely typecast. The rest provide decent support and are functional.On the whole Jeet is a fantastic films with barely any flaws. There are a few clichs but that is forgiven because this is one awesome flick for a mid 90s movie.".

At times I wonder if this was even an ideal title for the movie because Sunny was supposed to win the love for good and NOT lose her to Salman he always gets the girl in a 2 guy and 1 girl story. If it was just Sunny as the hero with a different plot then it would be even better. Another small problem is in the very last scene. After Sunny bashes the main baddie Amrish Puri then a moment later Sunny is shot but then he bounces back and kills him saving Salman's life but Sunny's character unwittingly dies which kind of makes the ending a little abrupt. This part makes no sense and it is unfair to Sunny as his character is one that wants a decent respectable love life NOT die. Only this aspect chops off 3 pts. from this vote. It was tough to see Lolo ditch Sunny for Salman but she later repented. Having said that Jeet could have easily done without Sunny's character dying because tragic endings are NOT wellreceived and they do NOT fit the story unless the hero was a famous martyr. However the baby boy at the end was named after Sunny's character. Surprisingly this film was a hit. Anyways the movie is NOT bad or anything just avoid tragic endings! Johnny Lever in the first half is funny!".

	schema:reviewBody "One can definitely expect nothing but loudness and trash from a movie that stars Sunny Deol Karishma Kapoor and Salman Khan in the leads. More so if it's directed by Raj Kanwar where one can additionally expect retarded filmmaking. 'Jeet' is pretty much a retarded remake of 'Muqaddar ka Sikander' which itself was a mindnumbingly boring movie. This one just has much more dishum dishum loudness and epileptic seizures than its source. Kajal Karishma Kapoor is an amateur dancer who witnesses the beating of a weakling at a market. The beating was carried out by a fat dirty goon Sunny Deol who probably never took a shower in his life. A CC corrupt cop happily arrests the goon who is later released upon bail by a beautiful harlot Tabu. The harlot happens to be in love with the goon only God knows why as there is nothing even remotely appealing about him but anyway. The goon harasses Kajal and her dad but when Kajal utters some bullcrap he backs off and begins stalking her. She is freaked out but once the goon rescues her from other goons Kajal is turned on and they fall in love. Goon promises to become exgoon and just when they decide to get married a rich idiot Salman Khab reenters Kajal's life and proposes. Kajal's pathetic father obliges her to marry the idiot. Kajal howls and throws tantrums but eventually agrees. The exgoon is furious and he roars like a bear he's does that many times in the movie. Kajal moves to Switzerland with her idiot husband and exgoon becomes a goon again. But when the married couple return to India Kajal is haunted by the goon.As bad as it is the fast forward option on your remote control comes very handy. I liked the song 'Dil Ka Kya Kare' that was visualized on the beautiful Tabu. She dances very well. The rest of the songs are bad and quite clichd with the same melodramatic lyrics. Salman and Karishma dance like epileptic cows who got stung on the ass by a swarm of bees. Kapoor also does a couple of shakethefartoff moves especially when dancing with Deol. Sunny dances like a hippopotamus. The acting is expectedly abysmal except for Amrish Puri who plays the villain with a T and Tabu who is good enough except in the final scene. I can see why Juhi Chawla turned down the role of Kajal.Except for Tabu's item number and her beauty I didn't find anything appealing about this silly film. In my books 'Jeet' is a loser.".

	schema:reviewBody "Even though this was released at a time when I used to watch a lot of movies for reason beyond my memory I had never seen this completely. I finally got round to watch this very recently and I can say that it was for the best. Had I watched this at the time I would have probably thought this is a movie that deserves 9 or 10 out of 10.This film belongs to 2 people only Sunny Doel who had some great scenes in the film followed by Tabu who after Sunny Doel had 2 of the best scenes in the film. Tabu had a handful of scenes but the 2 scenes that stand out are her confrontation with Inspector Pratap Vidyarthi Ashish Vidyarthi.Salman Khan one decent scene against Amrish Puri but for most of the film I found him annoying. When he enters into the film at around 45 Min's in I thought he was doing a poor impression of Shashi Kapoor. This is an actor who I thought gave some excellent performances in films like Karan Arjun Veergati and Andaz Apna Apna earlier here he probably thought what the hell lets just do the most over the top and really poor acting I can. Karishma Kapoor is a good actress but her performance in this movie was mediocre. Jonny Lever was wasted and all other actors supported fine. The child that Sunny Doel takes in i found could have been used better he was that balance between good and evil for Karan Sunny Doel.The movie itself is a 2 guys one girl and who ends up with the girl in the end. I am not a huge fan of the music from this movie I hate Nadeem Shravan as they put down the greatest music directors Bollywood had Laxmikant Pyarelal. That being said i think the best song in the whole film is the Kavita Krishnamurthy Song Dil Ka Kya Kahen Sahib pictured on Tabu. The rest were OK. Finally who was the choreographer for the songs in this movie? Sunny Doel looked so awkward and trying too hard in the song Yaara o Yaara Salman Khan looked like he was pissing himself laughing in one the songs and the choreography didn't even go with the songs. Would I watch the movie again? probably buy skipping through to watch the watchable bits and probably watching the whole movie in about 4560 Min's. This movie gets 5 out of 10 only for Sunny Doel and Tabu.".

This is an actor who I thought gave some excellent performances in films like Karan Arjun Veergati and Andaz Apna Apna earlier here he probably thought what the hell lets just do the most over the top and really poor acting I can. Karishma Kapoor is a good actress but her performance in this movie was mediocre. Jonny Lever was wasted and all other actors supported fine. The child that Sunny Doel takes in i found could have been used better he was that balance between good and evil for Karan Sunny Doel.The movie itself is a 2 guys one girl and who ends up with the girl in the end. I am not a huge fan of the music from this movie I hate Nadeem Shravan as they put down the greatest music directors Bollywood had Laxmikant Pyarelal. That being said i think the best song in the whole film is the Kavita Krishnamurthy Song Dil Ka Kya Kahen Sahib pictured on Tabu. The rest were OK. Finally who was the choreographer for the songs in this movie? Sunny Doel looked so awkward and trying too hard in the song Yaara o Yaara Salman Khan looked like he was pissing himself laughing in one the songs and the choreography didn't even go with the songs. Would I watch the movie again? probably buy skipping through to watch the watchable bits and probably watching the whole movie in about 4560 Min's. This movie gets 5 out of 10 only for Sunny Doel and Tabu.";

	schema:reviewBody "Kentucky Fried Movie is tasteless unsophisticated and decidedly sophomoric... and one of the most hilarious films ever made! A string of politically incorrect segments made by the creators of Airplane! and The Naked Gun KFM is an Rrated romp that today nearly 30 years after its release would be too shocking to even warrant the dreaded NC17 rating. Forget those unfunny amateurs Broken Lizard or the overrated Farrelly Brothers. We're talking naked breasts oral sex racial slurs violence... and yet each segment leaves you delirious from not only laughter but disbelief at the fact that the Zuckers actually go away with all this. I've discovered that it really takes a certain kind of innocence to make a movie like KFM a naive belief that people will simply laugh at the crude spectacle of it all. Segments include a wholesome couple listening to a 1950s style howto record on foreplay wait till you see what the record comes equipped with a thrill seeker whose trademark stunt is going to a crowd of black men and yelling out the Nword how bold is this scene? No one has dared imitate it since and a political debate between two analysts that ends with one of them cheerfully telling the other to blow it out your a and giving them the finger. The highlight is the minimovie within the movie A Fistful of Yen. A parody of all the Bruce Lee films its hero Loo fights the evil Klahn a onearmed criminal mastermind with a fondness for the phrase extraordinary magnitude. It also pokes fun at the endless fights from the Lee films as well as the characters' fractured English little trivia the actors really were Asian and spoke poor English in real life so it wasn't intentional on their parts The twist ending of Yen is one of the goofiest things you ever saw in your life. Despite the often offensive humor of KFM it's not a mean film by any means. No one is really safe from the wacky chaos it inflicts and it's just hilarious. In our time of handwringing political correctness KFM offers a cathartic experience of laughing out loud at our fears prejudices and yes stupidity. This is indeed a fingerlickin' good comedy.".

Written by Zucker Abraham and Zucker directed by John Landis and produced by Samuel L Bronkowitz just kidding The Kentucky Fried Movie is really nothing more than a collection of skits barely connected by the convention that they're all things you might see on TV or at the movies. But oh the skits. Let's just say that no single episode of Saturday Night Live was ever this funny.Best of the bunch is the movie's centerpiece A Fistful of Yen a deadon parody of kung fu action movies a la Enter The Dragon. In this bit the longest in the film a Bruce Lee type named Loo has to infiltrate a mountain fortress run by the villainous Dr. Klahn who is building an army of extraordinary magnitude. The martial arts scenes are hilarious it may be the most stagedlooking fighting of all time. Beginning with Loo training other fighters What was that? This is not a chawade. We need total concenTWAYtion he yells at one student and ending with Loo finally going home in a completely outofleftfield ending having nothing to do with the previous action but seeming somehow fitting anyway the slapstick jokes come fast and furious even parodying The Dating Game at one point. This is a direct precursor to ZAZ's later movies like Airplane! and The Naked Gun.Then there's the incredible Catholic High School Girls in Trouble which aims to parody 70s porno flicks More shocking than 'Behind the Green Door'... Never before has the beauty of the sexual act been so crassly exploited! the announcer screams. To get an idea of the kind of humor seen here picture a hot chick approaching a loser and saying in a breathy voice Show me your nuts! and the guy proceeding to start acting like a total loon. In United Appeal for the Dead Henry Gibson speaks at great length about death the number one killer in the United States and what his group can do to help a loved one who has died lead a normal life. That's Armageddon features George Lazenby and parodies every Irwin Allen disaster flick made. A young man and woman discover the pleasures of sex through an instructional record in Sex Record and Courtroom is a hilarious parody of courtroom melodramas featuring Wally the real Tony Dow and the Beav Jerry Zucker mugging it up in place of Jerry Mathers as observers. The movie begins and ends with two newsthemed skits AM Today and the racy Eyewitness News in which the newscasters watch a couple with the TV on having sex. And there's much more.The Kentucky Fried Movie is not for all tastes I've known people who have watched it and just said This is stupid. It is indeed stupid but within the confines of the genre it's one of the best. You'll laugh at the stupid jokes and stupid puns and stupid lines and stupid stunts all the way through if you like this sort of thing. The movie is very clever in how it packs the laughs.".

The Chinese he approached on the sidewalks and storefronts of Chinatown all refused his offer of work and the entourage proceeded westward aimlessly. After a short while they came upon the Belmont High School football field which at the time was filled with members of the track team warming down from their workouts. One of the captains of the team Carlos Mancilla by coincidencea Black Belt in Martial Arts was approached by Landis who explained his predicament. Carlos who had helped make and participate in student films at the time and whose schoolmates at the time were future playwright Lemar Fooks and the future Rosarita Food Company spokeswoman Sergia Sanchez and whose teacher at the time was Tom Waits father Frank Waits immediately picked up on the problem. He put the call out to the Chinese Friendship Club the tennis team and select members of the track team that had some knowledge of Martial Arts and within 30 minutes Landis had his Martial Arts army. Needless to say the sequence was a success all because of the fortuitous meeting between John Landis and one of his future extras Carlos Mancilla. Mancilla later sought out a career in movie production both as a setbuilder and bit player with which he is still involved in. Incidentally Mancilla founded a service which helped provide Hollywood productions with Biker and Gang Type extras. Some of the films he provided Bikers and 'Cholos' for were Back to the Future Part 2 American Me and Mi Vida Loca.".

This movie has a lot of sexual content that ticked somebody off I guess. This would make an excellent double feature with the earlier Groove Tube so you can see just what Saturday Night Live and other shows like that were trying to accomplish. 1970s adult film star Uschi Digart does a cameo during a shower scene that will not soon be forgotten once seen. Many many cameos to look for including Donald Sutherland Bill Bixby and on and on. The highlight of the movie is a minifilm called A Fistful of Yen which is a spoton parody of Bruce Lee's Enter The Dragon. Imagine Bruce Lee getting the treatment by the people behind Airplane and you get the idea. If you are in a silly mood this si a movie worth getting. Being that it was made in the 1970s I suppose being stoned would make this movie an absolute laughriot.".

This movie functions as a hysterical spoof of any kind of programming one might see in the theaters or on TV at the time. And as has been said this is definitely a product of its era. Younger viewers may not get a good deal of the jokes. But overall The Kentucky Fried Movie is wild stuff with the Z.A.Z. team throwing all caution to the wind and coming up with some wonderfully raunchy and outrageous stuff. There's no real through line merely a succession of parodies. The centerpiece is a lengthy Enter the Dragon mockery titled A Fistful of Yen which has hero Loo Evan C. Kim hired to infiltrate the criminal empire of a man named Dr. Klahn played by Master Bong Soo Han. Some of the Z.A.Z. team's jokes may tend towards the crude and immature but it's such a hoot that they just throw so much stuff at us much like Airplane! three years later. The pacing slows a bit during A Fistful of Yen but otherwise things move along quite well. TV commercials for such things as oil zinc oxide board games and beer dot the busy landscape along with spoofs of black  white courtroom shows disaster movies and jabs at news programming. The mock sexploitation trailer Catholic High School Girls in Trouble and blaxploitation trailer Cleopatra Schwartz provide some of the brightest moments and provide PLENTY of eye candy guaranteed to make many viewers happy. The feelaround segment is particularly funny using director John Landis's recurring See You Next Wednesday injoke and featuring a poster of his debut movie Schlock. Special guest appearances are made by such famous faces as Tony Dow from 'Leave It to Beaver' one time James Bond player George Lazenby the great Donald Sutherland and TV veterans Bill Bixby and Henry Gibson. Fans of 70's trash cinema will also note the presence of Marilyn Joi as Ms. Schwartz Tara Strohmeier Lenka Novak and well endowed Uschi Digard. Zucker Abrahams and Zucker themselves appear throughout makeup effects legend Rick Baker is the gorilla Landis the TV technician thrown by the gorilla and future Airplane! cast members Stephen Stucker and Leslie Nielsen uncredited are utilized as well. This is genuinely great unrestrained material that makes a number of comedies in the years since look bland in comparison. Highly recommended to fans of sketch comedy. Eight out of 10.".

	schema:headline " The DVD of Kentucky Fried Movie Outshines Airplane!";
	schema:reviewBody "In our millenial DVD culture we demand plenty of extras and insights. Kentucky Fried Movie the little movie that could delivers it. Regrettably its successor Airplane! didn't.  Both movies were made by the famous comedy moviemakers David Zucker Jim Abrahams and Jerry Zucker best known as ZAZ.  Kentucky Fried Movie or KFM as it is known was directed by John Landis who went to big projects as Animal House and The Blues Brothers.  As a small movie KFM would pave the way for the filmmakers successes.  But in DVD terms KFM did a much better job than Airplane! with extras aplenty.  Airplane! only had a trailer and ZAZ's mediocre commentary track which ZAZ did much better in KFM.  As for KFM's extras they included a hilarious 8minute home movie which ZAZ proved to their relatives they were making a real movie in Hollywood a clearcut photo gallery bios of ZAZ and John Landis and the best commentary track they have done so far.As for KFM what makes this small movie so special?  Although much of the movie is done tastelessly it is fun tastelessness that everyone in it is enjoying it.  There is a lot of nudity and foul language but it had it's heart in the right place.  And as for the cast there are mostly unknown actors and many of them are quite attractive and talented with cameos by more famous actors such as the late Bill Bixby in a headache sketch Donald Sutherland as a clumsy waiter in a sketch spoofing disaster movies and Leave it to Beaver stars Jerry Mathers and Tony Dow kidding themselves as bickering brother jurors in the courtroom sketch.This movie I think is the best spoof of pop culture I've ever seen outdoing its predecessor The Groove Tube made 3years earlier than KFM and featuring bits by a thenunknown and preSaturday Night Live Chevy Chase. One of my favorite skits are A.M. Today with a gorilla rampaging the studio scaring off everyone while a calm anchorwoman played by the lovely littleknown actress Janice Kentcontinues her duties of reporting the news. Another favorite isSex Records with a black couple being instructed on lovemaking by a record until the woman is whisked away by a black muscleman Yet another favorite is FeelARound where a theatre usher listens to the dialogue of a movie gets out his props to feel a movie goer even scaring him with a knife when the actress announces she'll cut up her lover with a knife. Then there is the final skit where a newsman from TV has the power to peer into the living room of a young couple having sex and his crew wellplayed by ZAZ themselves leer on.  But the best sketch of all is A Fistful of Yen a 17minute takeoff of Bruce Lee Movies featuring a lisping Karate champ fighting against the master despot Dr. Klahn who wants to take over the world and ends with the Hero in Dorothy drag spoofing The Wizard of Oz.If you like your DVDs and of a lowbudget movie KFM delivers the goods.  Hopefully there will be a special edition of Airplane! in the future for fans of that movie who were disappointed in the DVD treatment of that great classic  but let's not hold our breaths.  But for ZAZ fans KFM was the best DVD work they have done so far and it's a special edition in its own right outshining and outselling Airplane! by a substantial margin.".

Today with a gorilla rampaging the studio scaring off everyone while a calm anchorwoman played by the lovely littleknown actress Janice Kentcontinues her duties of reporting the news. Another favorite isSex Records with a black couple being instructed on lovemaking by a record until the woman is whisked away by a black muscleman Yet another favorite is FeelARound where a theatre usher listens to the dialogue of a movie gets out his props to feel a movie goer even scaring him with a knife when the actress announces she'll cut up her lover with a knife. Then there is the final skit where a newsman from TV has the power to peer into the living room of a young couple having sex and his crew wellplayed by ZAZ themselves leer on.  But the best sketch of all is A Fistful of Yen a 17minute takeoff of Bruce Lee Movies featuring a lisping Karate champ fighting against the master despot Dr. Klahn who wants to take over the world and ends with the Hero in Dorothy drag spoofing The Wizard of Oz.If you like your DVDs and of a lowbudget movie KFM delivers the goods.  Hopefully there will be a special edition of Airplane! in the future for fans of that movie who were disappointed in the DVD treatment of that great classic  but let's not hold our breaths.  But for ZAZ fans KFM was the best DVD work they have done so far and it's a special edition in its own right outshining and outselling Airplane! by a substantial margin.";

	schema:reviewBody "Unfamiliar with the works of Hong Sangsoo I started watching 'The Power of Kangwon Province'. In the early scenes of the film you see a microphone appearing used for recording sound. I paused the movie briefly and checked on Google just to make sure that this was really a picture made by a critically acclaimed director. After Google gave me the confirmation I finished the movie in one go satisfied about my first encounter with director Hong.'The Power of Kangwon Province' is a South Korean drama first released in 1998 and is written and directed by Hong Sangsoo. This film was Hong's second and other praised movies by Hong are 'The Day a Pig fell into a Well' and 'Virgin Stripped Bare by her Bachelors'. The movie stars Oh Yunhong as student Jisook and Baek Jonghak as college professor Sangkwon. I also recognised Kim Yoosuk as a policeman. Kim played one of the leading roles in 'The Isle'.The Kangwon province with mountains and forests is located in the north eastern part of South Korea and the demilitarised zone splits up the area and continues into North Korea. This movie however is not about the Korean divide but about relationships. 'The Power of Kangwon Province' tells actually two stories. The first part of the movie is about Jisook who is on a trip to the Kangwon province with her two girlfriends where she strikes up a fling with a policeman. The second part of the film involves the story of Sangkwon a husband and father who visits the mountains of Kangwon for leisure together with a friend. Both men end up in the arms of a prostitute. During the movie by coincidence both stories cross each other and at the end of the movie director Hong connects the two stories together.The style of filming editing and use of music is very minimalistic but the end result is intriguing. Every camera shot is a steady shot that doesn't zoom in or out or moves sideways followed by a hard cut to the next shot. Music only plays at the beginning and ending. By the way that Hong is filming you really feel connected to the actors and therefore closer to Hong's dim view on relationships between man and a woman. You feel the pain and sorrow of Jisook when she returns from Kangwon by bus and cries and cries and cries. Even the sex scenes feel so sad and basically Hong managed to remove the sex out of the sex scenes.It is unclear to me why Hong left in the scenes where the microphone is noticeable as mentioned in the introduction. 'The Power of Kangwon Province' is however worth watching for its unusual minimalistic style and the underlying depressing note of the film. If you are in a positive mood then I would recommend you to wait watching this movie as it affects your mood significantly but if you have the chance to see this picture please do so. Overall rating 6.9".

The overt minimalism is slightly less pronounced here than in their work although it still completely fits that style the camera never moves even once and somehow I found the film less selfconsciously slow than Tsai MingLiang or Hou Hsiaohsien which I think is part of the reason I enjoyed it more. Plus it doesn't keep it's subjects quite as detached as Hou does. I felt like the film was also somehow more complete and less openended just barely than some of their work although that's not to say it had much of anything resembling a forwardmoving plot. I would have a hard time believing that Sophia Coppola wasn't directly influenced by this film for Lost in Translation scenes of a young woman wandering around by herself and languishing in her hotel room wearing punk panties can't help but seem familiar.".

The plot is obscured behind some seemingly vacuous dialog for most of the movie and there isn't really a traditional arc for either the plot or the characters  so you can call this contemplative. The director succeeds in encouraging the audience to recall its own emotional reactions rather than be forced to react along with its characters  you don't really get 'drawn in' to this movie you're drawn along with it like watching the scenery change as you float down river. It's successful and well done but for all its positives low on entertainment value.Additionally this movie is not like Hou Hsiao Hsien or Tsai Ming Liang. This movie does have a more or less stationary camera lack of score and generally nonglamorous locations and characters but that does not qualify as similar to or reminiscent of those filmmakers as other reviewers have suggested. If you want to compare this to another 'Asian New Wave' movie you've seen this is more in keeping with an Ed Yang film although lacking the grandeur and narrative complexity. So even that comparison is a stretch. To me this looks and feels much more like an early Jarmusch movie just with more sympathetic if less interesting characters. That comparison may give you a better sense of what you're sitting down to watch.".

Granted the premise is interesting a team of goofball matchmakers work surreptitiously to turn strangers into couples. But as with most comedies the premise is strained to such effect that is not credible that it becomes silly. Take for an instance the crew go to extremes to orchestrate fake rain outside of a cafe where the woman they are targeting to bewitch works. This is done so to conjure a romantic ambiance. But then is it even possible to bribe that many passersby to hole umbrellas? Are they extras? I guess the audience is supposed to suspend all disbelief as it is supposed to be lighthearted meaning light on the brain.Gripes about the overthetop scenes aside you should take to the good looking cast and hide the above misgivings under the theatre seat. For women who like their guys rough on the edge but tender at the core there's brusque hunk Minyeong Park Sinhye. And for those who like theirs lanky geeky and deeply apologetic there's pushover financial consultant Sang Yong Daniel Choi.And with these two delectable guys there has to be two worthy foils who come in the elusive squintyeyed Heejoong Lee Minjeong and petite doeeyed Minyeong Park Shinhye. So depending on your taste you can indulge in your kind of eyecandy.But having said all that if you are a serious cinephile it's hard to take to this movie seriously. Apart from a nifty twist at the end that plays sly reference to the Cyrano De Bergerac legend the rest is mostly a humdrum affair.But if you are looking for a harmless movie that is not heavy with metaphors to impress your easytoplease date look no further.".

The Cyrano Agency is not your typical matchmaking agency where dates get set up and you turn up crossing your fingers on compatibility conversation and so on. Its selling point is confidentiality since it involves a great deal of social engineering on the part of the Agency staff crafting meticulous details from seemingly chanced scenarios to operate in right down to the minutest of things to say and do.The brainchild of the agency is ByungHoon Uhm TaeWoong who together with his failed troupe of actors and crew MinYoung Park ShinHye JaePil Jun AMin and ChulBin Park CheolMin form the core of Cyrano Agency where like its namesake become Cyrano de Bergerac equivalents through the adoption of the stage play for a larger playing field in real world dating in order to keep afloat pay the bills and one day reopen and get back to their original theatre business. It's a temporary set up that employ the widest range of their skill sets combined where we spend a significant portion of the first act understanding the lengths they will go to for their clients to be successfully hooked up with the woman of their dreams  yes it does seem like a predominantly male clientle they attract.The story picks up when a nerdy fund manager SangYong David Choi walks in and Byung Hoon discovers that the target the agency is engaged to snag is none other than his ex girlfriend Hee Joong Lee MinJung. Talk about dilemmas here especially when there's still that lingering affection and of course given the amount of manipulation that goes behind the scenes there's this level of deception that one probably won't even want to put an ex through and it also tosses up questions involving sincerity whether to attempt a pursuit on your own given flaws warts and all or to rely on others since the pursuer obviously is having no qualms about getting everything engineered to seal the deal.Like a typical Korean film there's room for comedy as well as melodrama in a bloated film adamant in covering a lot of ground. There's the exploits of Sang Yong in getting to be within Hee Joong's attention radar which the Agency crafts with laughs coming from the former's penchant to drift beyond his prepared script and the various ribtickling efforts from members of the agency who pride themselves in their work sometimes not going according to plan when their thinking on their feet fails. Then there's ByungHoon's inevitable meddling when not being able to separate business and personal seeing it as an opportunity once again to work his issues with his ex when the cards fall into the right places.And Uhm TaeWoong has that charisma to play the flawed Cyrano bringing in the melodramatic elements as the story unfolded given the back story of the romance between him and MinJeong and how it sparked and eventually deteriorated so in effect you get two stories for the price of one with a twist in perception of this relationship put on the back burner. Exploration of the themes of Trust and Love and the prioritization and importance of these two elements in a relationship got pushed to the forefront instead as the narrative builds toward its finale with both SangYong and Hee Joong vying for Hee Joong with one obviously not in the know of the other who's operating in the shadows providing avenues for heart warming and wrenching emotional outpouring in one combined pivotal scene.Then of course there's the performance of Lee MinJung the central object of affection with those anime large and saucer shaped eyes you probably cannot keep your attention off since they speak volumes for her character whether rolling them in exasperation or connecting and communicating with her beaus through one key element of nonverbal expression of emotion. It's no wonder her performance here had snagged her a number of Best New Actress awards in Korea last year enhancement notwithstanding! as the Roxanne equivalent caught up with conflicting emotions.The film had probably presented its arguments to try and swing the audience's sympathy toward the Christian character here rather than for Cyrano but unfortunately cannot let go from its need to have an uplifting factor since this is a romantic comedy after all with a minor romantic subplot kept brewing that you'll probably see it coming from the start. Personally the story of SangYong's pursuit of Hee Joong actually took a backseat as being the weaker of the two broad romances here and is a tad unconvincing since after all it's engineered to perfection even. Still there are plenty of stories out there about others attempting to hijack the mark they're employed to cover  coming to mind is Hollywood's own zany comedy There's Something About Mary  but for a more Asian spin coming from an adaptation of a well known classic Cyrano Agency scores big marks.".

Sure the projects are too few to get a good taste of what is happening but still it's interesting to see how they operated. After the first operation the movie focuses more on two or three characters and leaves the other guys aside as they only play side roles. Though the flashbacks aren't that confusing and the performances were good the big mystery behind the lead character's past relationship wasn't that big of a mystery after all as it wasn't enough to create a thrill mood for the audience.

Boy who secretly followed Tarzan during his last visit to the city naively shows them the way leading to an inevitable clash. Tarzan comes to the rescue.";

Most importantly however is the return of Tarzan's matewife Jane formerly played by the redheaded Maureen O'Sullivan at MGM now enacted by the blonde Brenda Joyce. With Joyce tackling over the part Boy no longer addresses her as Mother but by her first name. After two previous entries bearing World War II related themes and invasion of Nazis the series returns to basic formula of white hunters on a friendly mission to become dangerous intruders to the Tarzan family when greed of gold is concerned.AMAZONS opens with Tarzan Johnny Weissmuller his son Boy Johnny Sheffield and their pet chimpanzee Cheetah setting out to meet with Jane who is scheduled to return home from her trip in England. While rafting down the river Tarzan rescues a girl from a lion attack.

He refuses and orders them to go. Not wanting his new friends to leave Boy escorts them to the civilization himself leading to all sorts of trouble in the horizon for all.Aside from the standard routines normally found in Tarzan films the writers of TARZAN AND THE AMAZONS toss in some routinely situations found in family life. Tarzan and Boy have their oneonone arguments as any father would have with his son. Sheffield's Boy who usually looks up to Tarzan in a hero worshiping sense as would any little boy towards his father show signs of adolescence by acting out his frustrations questioning authority namely Tarzan's. For Boy who has known no other existence except roaming around halfnaked throughout the jungle boredom has now taken its toll causing Boy to have an attitude especially when finding the archaeologists more interesting in comparison to Tarzan. Tarzan believing that Boy will forget these men invites him to go hunting as promised but Boy stirs up trouble by saying he never wants to go hunting with him again. Tarzan's frustration is sensed when breaking Boy's hunting bow. While this doesn't really make as strong a statement as father and son relationships are concerned this does prove that these two characters are just like anyone else. In typical fashion when father and son are on nonspeaking terms it is usually the mother Jane in this case to come to Boy's aide and not taking sides. Boy showing no signs of wanting to burst out singing Oh My Papa can be just as stubborn than Tarzan. Tarzan believes Boy will eventually calm down and return home unaware that he and the researchers are being held prisoners by the Amazons never to be seen or heard from the outside world again.What makes TARZAN AND THE AMAZONS worth viewing is the presence of famed Russian actress Maria Ouspenskaya playing the Amazon Queen. Short in size slow in speech delivery heavy accented but no raving beauty to say the least those familiar with her on screen personality normally feel her presence in any sort of motion picture. Henry Stephenson who was earlier seen in TARZAN FINDS A SON appears for the second and final time in the series while Barton MacLane most noted for his gangster roles or playing good tough guys in Warner Brothers crime dramas of the 1930s makes an impressive villain in his first of two roles in the Tarzan series.Light on action and long on dialog during its 76 minutes TARZAN AND THE AMAZONS makes interesting character study and routine adventure for any juvenile crowd.

So the film contains family values greedy treasure hunters good looking Amazon woman Tarzan to the rescue and of course Cheetah the chimpanzee getting into his usual mischief. It is another very good actionadventure film for all the Tarzan fans out there.I give it a solid 7 out of 10 rating some 73 years after the films original release date.".

Tarzan himself dealt with the Nazis in his usual manner in these last two films himself Tarzan Triumphs and Tarzan's Desert Mystery. Jane is now played by Brenda Joyce as Tarzan and his family are fully reunited now. She's bought some friends along headed by Henry Stephenson who is fascinated by a bracelet that Cheetah found for Jane. It speaks of an ancient legend of an Amazon tribe and a lost city. Of course Tarzan knows all about it and he's been keeping the Amazons a secret. There ain't nothing in the jungle that he doesn't know about. And in Tarzan And The Amazons the usual common theme of all Tarzan films comes true. Outsiders only mean trouble especially if they come from civilization.Stephenson is a cultured scientist but the rest of his crew have their own ideas. Folks like Barton MacLane Lionel Royce Don Douglas J.M. Kerrigan and Steven Geray see visions of untold riches. I think you can figure the rest of this story out.Tarzan And The Amazons features Maria Ouspenskaya as the ancient Queen of the Amazons who exacts hard punishment for those who violate the sanctity of the Amazons She's always good even in some really terrible films. This like so many other Hollywood films with an African setting give us a pulp fiction view of that continent. It was only in the Fifties with King Solomon's Mines and The African Queen that we started getting a realistic view of Africa. Still Tarzan And The Amazons is entertaining enough in a pulp fiction sort of way.".

I think you can figure the rest of this story out.Tarzan And The Amazons features Maria Ouspenskaya as the ancient Queen of the Amazons who exacts hard punishment for those who violate the sanctity of the Amazons She's always good even in some really terrible films. This like so many other Hollywood films with an African setting give us a pulp fiction view of that continent. It was only in the Fifties with King Solomon's Mines and The African Queen that we started getting a realistic view of Africa. Still Tarzan And The Amazons is entertaining enough in a pulp fiction sort of way.";

	schema:headline " If Tarzan had had a pet cheetah would he have called it Chimpanzee?";
	schema:reviewBody "Tarzan has appeared on screen in nearly a hundred films mostly made in the thirties forties and fifties they were often shown on television during my childhood and were a favourite of mine. Edgar Rice Burroughs' character was originally a British aristocrat abandoned in the jungle as a baby and raised by a tribe of apes but these aspects of the story were often omitted from the later films. The basic setup is that Tarzan lives in the African jungle with his wife or girlfriend the question of whether they actually possess a marriage certificate is discreetly avoided Jane their unimaginatively named teenage son Boy and their more imaginatively but confusingly named pet chimpanzee Cheeta. If they had had a pet cheetah would they have called it Chimpanzee? This particular episode came out early in 1945 so includes a patriotic subplot involving Jane's return from England where she has been working as an army nurse. As its title suggests this movie concerns a tribe of Amazons living in a mountain fastness not far from Tarzan's lair. The Amazons have a rather unusual society all of its members are female again the question of how they reproduce is tactfully avoided and all are young and attractive apart from their elderly Queen. A group of explorers turns up in search of Palmyria the lost city of the Amazons. Tarzan suspecting their motives refuses to assist them but Boy believing he is aiding the advancement of science is happy to do so. It is left to Tarzan to sort out the problems which result when some of the explorers try to steal the Amazons' treasures. The film is officially set in Africa but the filmmakers do not seem to have been aiming at realism at least not of the zoological variety because the creatures inhabiting this particular jungle include Indian elephants South American monkeys Australian cockatoos deer native to Eurasia and the Americas but not Africa and Canada Geese North America. In fact the only continent not represented here is Antarctica and that is possibly only because no penguins were available at the time. Even some of the authentically African animals we see such as lions and crowned cranes are natives of the continent's savannas rather than its jungles. Another strange thing about the film is that nearly all the cast are white. Tarzan Jane and Boy are white as are all the explorers. Even the Amazons drawn partly from Greek mythology and partly from the pages of a Wonder Woman comic are all Caucasian. The only black characters we see are a few servants and bearers. In fact although the film is set in subSaharan Africa not a single black actor has a speaking role. I knew that Hollywood operated an unofficial colour bar in the forties but I did not realise that it went quite as far as that. Before he became the cinema's bestknown Tarzan Johnny Weissmuller was an Olympic swimmer and won five gold medals in that sport. Truth to tell if acting had been an Olympic sport he would not even have been a contender for a bronze medal but he was cast more on the basis of his impressive physique than of his acting skills and might have made more of an impression had he been able to deliver his lines in normal English. Tarzan always speaks a sort of broken pidgin English although Jane and Boy always speak normally. Moreover his acting is no worse than that on display from a lot of his fellow cast members. Despite some dodgy acting dodgy zoology banal plots and some covert racist assumptions I have always had something of a soft spot for these old Tarzan films doubtless based on my childhood memories. They have a certain innocence about them taking place as they do in some idealised nevernever land where good always triumphs over evil and the big man will always come swinging through the trees to sort everything out and put everything right. Although they were probably not made exclusively as children's entertainment they have the sort of charm and sense of moral rightness which will always appeal to children and to those adults who still remember their childhood with affection. 510".

	schema:reviewBody "This film was released in April 1945 very close to the end of WW2 and likely reflects some of the subrosa anxieties of this period. Specifically some of the allied servicemen had already been musteredout due to wounds etc. and some had been rotated back the USA at the time of this film's production. So it was that many men raised in a highly machismo and patriarchal society found themselves contending with wives and girlfriends who had been empowered by wartime factory work and children who had suddenly become rebellious adolescents.And so it is that we find Tarzan contending with a secret society of matriarchal Amazons fiercer and sexier than Rosie the Riveter and with a rebellious adolescent son.It is also fitting that this film marks the return of Jane to the Tarzan series. Intelligent Tarzan scholars can disagree as to who is the greatest Tarzan in cinema but there is universal acknowledgment that Maureen O'Sullivan was the greatest Jane. Despite this Brenda Joyce was an amiable replacement wholesomesexy and not obnoxious and she fit with the peculiar chemistry of the Tarzan films and so we like her.The last 4 Weismuller Tarzan films feature titles that name female characters. Besides this one there was 'Tarzan and the Leopard Woman' 'Tarzan and the Huntress' and 'Tarzan and the Mermaids.' Likely the producers were attempting to lure more heterosexual men and other lovers of female beauty into the theaters to broaden the apeman's appeal beyond the 12yearold demographic.This film is a little short on action although we do get to see Our Hero fight a crocodile and we see an adequate degree of peril and hazard. To it's credit the script calls for Tarzan to express several philosophical concepts using his own unique modality of thought which author Jose Phillip Farmer describes as being 'Tarzanic.' In one instance Tarzan issues forth what amounts to a haiku likening the dazzling effect of gold on human greed to way the sun blinds those who stare directly at it. In another instance Tarzan issues this pithy gem 'Every time men bring guns men bring trouble.' There is a quality of mythology to this film which compensates for the reduced action and this is something of an initiation rite for Boy.Also the Amazons are sexy.A lot of people bag on the RKO Tarzans because they are smaller budget than the MGM's and because Weismuller has a bigger gut but such concerns are trivial. This film contains Weismuller who still had the confidence charisma and conviction to be a convincing Tarzan and whose portrayal of the apeman was the most distinctive of all actors. I recommend this film for all fans of vintage Bmovies and fans of Weismuller.".

Classic storyTarzan swings from tree to tree rescuing people from wild animals and bad guys cardboard scenery and not a very impressive Tarzan too.This is in fact the biggest flaw of this film. I've seen Gordon Scott play Tarzan in the much better TARZAN'S GREATEST ADVENTURE and thought former swimming champion Weissmuller was the greatest Tarzan of all. I don't know if Johnny Weismuller always looked like he does here but I can say that he doesn't look like a champion at all. There's no greatness in his performance at all nor does he look like an athlete. I heard that he got tired after a few films more and decided to stop playing Tarzan and this seems to be the case here already. One of the few good things about this film is Cheetah. What a great job of the animal trainers here! Great fun to watch when Cheetah is on screen This together with the fact that the film isn't very longwhich is good because there really isn't much story too is the only thing why one should see this minor Tarzanepisode. 510".

However and I am not sure why Weissmuller and 'Boy' Johnny Sheffield jumped from this prestige studio to the less than stellar RKOwhere the budgets shrank considerably as did the quality. The scripts got a lot more weird and the films became chock full of poorly integrated stock footage and animals that often weren't even African. Additionally 'Jane' Maureen O'Sullivan remained at MGM and a new leading lady needed to be found. After having the character be 'off on vacation in England' or 'helping with the war effort' in a couple films RKO decided to recast this character with Brenda Joycewho bore little similarity to O'Sullivan.Early in the film Tarzan happens upon an Amazon lady who is being chased by leopards. She's injured her leg and Tarzan insists on carrying her back to her Amazon city. However apparently it's taboo to either leave the town or enter it if you are an outsider. Fortunately the Amazon Priestess knows that Tarzan can be trusted and apparently he's the only outsider they ever let leave the city alive.A bit later Jane arrives from one of her many trips and brings with her some friends. Unfortunately these hunters turn out to be headed for disaster when they see a bracelet left by the Amazon who Tarzan rescuedand they decide to try to find this Amazon kingdom themselves! But Tarzan wisely refuses to help themespecially since some of them Ballister in particular are real jerks! Oddly Ballister is played by Barton MacLanethe same actor who reappears in Tarzan and the Huntress but he plays a different charactereven though he dies in Tarzan and the Amazons! Considering that these two films were only made a couple years apart you do wonder why they chose him for both films. And now that I think of it Henry Stephenson a wonderful character actor was also in Tarzan Finds a Son!and was killed in that filmyet appears in this one a few years later! Despite these odd casting problems this film actually turns out to be a pretty good onethough they never explain how a group of very white women happened to be living in the heart of Africa! The film lacks the bad stock footage of some of the other RKO Tarzan films and at least the black natives are blackand not Mexicans like in the studio's last film in the series well after it had 'jumped the shark'. In addition the film is well written and quite entertainingone of the last ones like this in the series.".

	schema:reviewBody "The ninth movie in the Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan series and third since the series moved from MGM to RKO is also the first to feature an actress besides Maureen O'Sullivan playing Jane. In the first two RKO films Jane was off helping with the war effort in England. Now it's time for her to come home but alas O'Sullivan wouldn't return to the part so it was recast with Brenda Joyce. Maureen is certainly missed but Brenda does a decent job and would play Jane for the remainder of the Weissmuller films. As I said Jane returns home to Africa but she doesn't come alone. She brings with her some archaeologists who are interested in the lost city of the Amazons a tribe of women warriors. Tarzan knows where the city is but won't tell them. If you've seen even one Tarzan movie before this you should know the outsiders won't leave it alone. They convince Boy to lead them to the Amazon city where they are not greeted with open arms.I noticed Johnny Sheffield the actor playing Boy is in the middle of puberty by this point and his voice is noticeably deeper than the last film in the series. It's the sort of thing you probably only notice when you watch the series back to back. Sheffield's enjoyable though Boy's a bit of a brat in this one. Cheeta the series' regular scene stealer is great as always. Henry Stephenson plays the kindly old lead archaeologist who has no clue how rotten his friends are. Barton MacLane makes a particularly slimy heavy. The Amazons are lovely young women in skimpy for the time outfits. Nothing wrong with that. Pretty Shirley O'Hara is the one given the most to do. Their leader is the awesome Maria Ouspenskaya. She's always a treat to watch. Nice sets and matte paintings. The Amazon stuff is lots of fun. As with all of the RKO Tarzan movies this is a solid escapist adventure film. Nothing deep but good to watch on a lazy weekend.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tarzan and the Amazons 1945  12 out of 4 Johnny Weissmuller's ninth time playing Tarzan has him and Boy Johnny Sheffield welcoming home Jane Brenda Joyce who also brings with her some archaeologists. They soon learn of a secret tribe of women led by Maria Ouspenskaya and ask Tarzan to take them to the ladies. He refuses but Boy agrees to take them not realizing that some of the men in the group have bad plans for them. This entry is certainly a step up from the previous TARZAN'S DESERT MYSTERY but it's still a long ways off from the early films when the series was still with MGM. With that said if you enjoy B movies and especially those with Tarzan there are enough good moments here to make the film worth sitting through at least once. As you'd expect the real highlight comes from the goodhearted performance of Weissmueller. No one would ever call him a great actor but what he lacked as an actor perfectly made him suitable to play Tarzan. If you've seen any of his future Jungle Jim movies then you know his line delivery was pretty poor but when you play Tarzan this actually helps things. Weissmuller might have played this role eight times before but it's clear he's still having fun with it and this certainly comes across and is quite apparent to the viewer. Sheffield is also pretty good in his role as Boy and shares a lot of chemistry with Weissmuller. Joyce certainly isn't going to make anyone forget Maureen O'Sullivan but she's cute enough in the part and her flirtatious ways with Tarzan were quite charming. The supporting cast includes Ouspenskaya THE WOLF MAN who is sadly underused Barton MacLane and Henry Stephenson. For the majority of the running time we get the cheap thrills one had come to expect from the series. These range of lions going on the attack to the crocodiles who are constantly swimming after someone to do damage only to have Tarzan step in. These type of thrills are things we've seen before but they still work here. What doesn't work too well is that there's about 1520 minutes where the viewer has to just sit still and listen to Tarzan refuse to help the men. There's a long stretch where nothing much happens and the film starts to drag here before finally picking up with the action packed ending. The female tribe run around in skimpy clothing for some sex appeal but I was curious how a group of all ladies were able to reproduce when none of them had ever seen a man.".

Wooden acting and predictable plotting sink it after a reasonable opening. Brenda Joyce appears as the returning Jane  her first entry in the series  with Barton MacLane your arch villain. The cast also includes Henry Stephenson as key supporting players of the '30s and early '40s find themselves somewhat slumming.";

The matte used to depict the craggy mountains in the distance was mysterious and nicely done. The sets that show Tarzan traveling through those mountains showed the harshness and isolation of the area. The city with its strange god and creepy priestess was interesting. The big problem was that these sections only added up to about a third of the movie while the boring family scenes took up the rest. The producer really dropped the ball on this one. There was so much potential wasted here. It could've been an imaginative romp through a strange world but they chose to constantly show Cheetah fishing and acting like an idiot and Boy sweeping the treehouse and... Plus the big dramatic ending seems totally rushed and happens in a flash. If you blink you'll miss it. It's like they said to themselves Oops we spent too much time on the family stuff we're at 115 we better cut it off now. No one will notice. Well I guess they were right seeing how many 10 votes this lame movie got. Do you people actually think this deserves to be up there with Citizen Kane the Shawshank Redemption and the Godfather?This is a lame movie with zealous and stupid fans.

I liked Taxi 1 'meh'ed at Taxi 2 and thinking that a trend has begun and that Taxi 3 would suck so bad I found myself laughing a LOT at Taxi 3...The jokes were funny and unexpected. The little throwaway gag of a policeman on a bicycle and his partner running beside him was made even funnier by how the politiciansministers commented on it. Other jokes The pregnancy test! The torture! The hidden 8 month pregnancy! Bai Ling! actually she wasn't too bad Acting seemed more natural or at least more in character in this movie. The caricatures of Daniel Lilly and Emilien were better defined with a real sense of camaraderie between Daniel and Emilien. Their scenes together have them really playing off each other. I did notice a little Are they JUST friends? vibe in Taxi 2 and their We're going from friends to Daddies together! scene totally made fun of the homo eroticism or whatever it was I imagined!Also it was interesting how Lilly evolved from a 2D romantic interest in Taxi 1 to a phonenosexbuddy in Taxi 2 to a nagging but still loving girlfriend here and she finally gets to sit in the TAXI!. The inspector just cracks me up with his soft toocalm Emilien after the Santa Claus suit incident. This was so much funnier than a screaming Emmmmeeeeellliienn! And his key words! Concertation. Reflexion. Action! with the perfect gestures and armpumping motion. Question I thought the inspector hated all foreigners? So why the Bai Ling crush? And who knew Alain the token French black dude was so funny! hehe I'm used to it. Funny facial expressions. Kinda glad they showed a little more of him in this film.All three movies were very well paced for action comedies. Right number of laughs and heart stopping scenes! The actors seemed to have fun in this one and you can really feel it. I didn't even mind that Samy Naceri looks ridiculously old since the first one where he was 37! because he just IS cocky yet charming Daniel and no one else can replace him. If you have this on DVD make sure to watch the Making of special feature because seriously how does the car miss the little camera in the middle of the road?!Video Games Influence Crazy Taxi AND Jet Grind Radio and a little bit of Burnout hee!".

Add to that healthy chemistry between the two leads and you get all the ingredients needed for a good buddycop movie.Unfortunately Besson simply fails to string these bits and pieces into a coherent whole. Bad guys are the repeat from the second part only without kungfu and cool cars pretty stupid decision for a movie targeting car enthusiast and their plans and actions are complete nonsense. The whole plot seems to be there just as an excuse to throw in a bunch of obvious selfreferences lame cameos Sylvester Stalone as a secret agent? and extreme sport mixtapes Besson's latest fetish it seems.Action scenes are the final nail on the coffin. The Taxi series never had really spectacular car chases the closest they came was the Paris scene in Taxi II but they at least HAD some chases. Here it's all bikes monstertrucks rollerskates and skis. Daniel's taxi performs several stunts and grows a few more SF accessories but it doesn't really have much to work with given the opposing arsenal.Overall the movie has some funny bits even more if you speak French but the rest of it was pretty disappointing.".

	schema:reviewBody "In fact this amoeba of a movie really might be the very worst film I've ever seen or ever will see and even that's being VERY generous. Now I enjoyed the first Taxi movie which had a sense of speed and fun even if there weren't many stunts. I even enjoyed Taxi 2 in its nobrainer way despite the worse direction different director held over for this one for some inexplicable reason because it had plenty of good stunts. But this film really is like the filmmakers knew they'd have a guaranteed audience no matter what so decided to spend 83 very long minutes throwing merde at the audience to see if they'd eat it. It's that bad. No it's worse.It starts off with some badly shot stunts ripped off from Jackie Chan's Operation Condor that lead into our hero giving a James Bond figure a lift he'll never forget. Now obviously Pierce Brosnan's contract wouldn't let him do it but they could have tried for Timothy Dalton or even Roger Moore. I'm sure if Roge was busy they could have got George Lazenby who's done that sort of thing before enough times. But no the joke falls flat because they get that epitome of suave sophisticated British espionage himself Slyvester Stallone dubbed badly into French to do the part. Worse is that not only is this almost the best part of the film but it has the only stunts in the whole picture. It does lead into a very very funny oneminute sendup of the new Bond title sequences that is genuinely terrific but once that's over turn off at once  you will not get the next 70 minutes of your life back and you will resent it.It's horribly wrong on every level. The two stars don't even meet for 45 minutes and when they do the charm is replaced with whining there are no chases or big stunts  this from a film who's only reason to exist is car stunts  and a boring plot about Chinese villains disguising themselves as rollerblading Santas to rob Marseilles' biggest bank. But in the end they don't bother they go to Switzerland instead. The taxi follows them the robbers get very easily arrested and the cop goes to hospital where the girlfriend he didn't notice was pregnant for 8 months is having a baby. The end. Add terrible horrible mistimed 'comic' relief from Bernard Farcy playing a pompous deluded chief inspector and Bai Ling horrendously made up as the most repugnant racist stereotype of Chinese whoredom sorry there's no other description in a hideously misogynist part and you've got a film that manages to be dumb boring pointless and offensive without ever passing 'vaguely interesting' along the way. When the best joke is a dumb comic relief black cop being run over by a car he's trying to commandeer because he's black It's okay I'm used to it you know you're in the beep Never have I seen a film so lazy and with so much contempt for its audience and I've seen three Michael Bay movies.

Still the opening sequence with a cameo by Stallone is okay though the great stunts are badly shot and the Bondstyle credit sequence is very funny. After that though it's a dull story about a bunch of SantaClaus bank robbers who happen to be Chinese who plan to rob the biggest bank in Marseille. But there are no action sequences no plot to speak of no impressive stunts and a lastminute change of locale from Marseille to Switzerland just to have the supertaxi driving along ski trails. There isn't even a climactic stunt sequence to speak of. Luc Besson specializes in making really bad mainstream entertainment which doesn't even obey the rules of the genre replacing them with lame banter between the leads and some halfhearted gags ridiculing the police.

With Christmas approaching the police are convinced they are planning their biggest robbery yet. Not surprisingly police operations don't go according to plan policeman milien manages to arrest his boss Commissaire Gibert because he had failed to tell his men that he was 'going undercover' by dressing as Father Christmas. Then Gibert allows a Chinese reporter into the police station and to accompany the police on active operations it is a pity she is one of the gang! Somewhat inevitable milien ends up enlisting the help of his taxi driving friend Daniel and after a few problems they go after the thieves. If that wasn't enough both milien and Daniel learn that their girlfriends are pregnant in milien's case he hadn't a clue even though she was eight months pregnant!Anybody who has seen the previous two instalments in this series of French films will know what to expect lots of comically over the top action including a taxi that travels faster than a speeding TGV train. The opening gives a hint of what is to come as Daniel drives Sylvester Stallone to the airport at high speed before the Bondspoofing opening credits. The film itself is chock full of laugh out loud moments. Much of these laughs come during the overthetop chases which involve thieves on rollerblades being pulled behind motorbikes thieves in a monster truck and thieves skiing down a mountain followed by Daniel's 'winterised' taxi. Not all the laughs come from the chases we have a drug dealer openly offering is wares to police officers in the police station Giberts arrest and its hilarious aftermath and general police incompetence . The cast does a fine job playing their roles fairly straight despite the ridiculousness of the situation. Overall I'd recommend this to anybody wanting some good silly fun.These comments are based on watching the film in French with English subtitles.".

	schema:reviewBody "By the time Taxi 3 will for whatever reason roll onto your screens right before your eyes after having seen the first two in this laborious French franchise you'll only be as tired of it as those playing the lead roles look of their characters. The film is a limp dull daft repetitive plodding piece a wondering staggering film dragging its content along like a Neanderthal from manya century ago might drag its knuckles along as it journeyed from A to B. Thin on plot and character but high on spectacle moping and chasing the series takes a turn at stage three to lessso resemble a Ferrari and moreso begin to dramatically resemble a beaten up 80s Lada. Like a Rickshaw driver at the end of a very busy day this series has officially stretched its premise and wholly run out of puff and I wouldn't be so sour about things if it'd brought about better products out of Luc Besson's Europacorp company in recent years. Sadly the paycheque and that's all Taxi 3 is clearly went on to fund other ventures Besson has had a finger in developing since such as the Transporter series and the Banal Banlieue 13 franchise.The film actually beings with a mockJames Bond opening sequence in which action man Sly Stallone is chased by a bunch of XtremeSports bad guys before bumping into Daniel's Naceri taxi and speeding off out running a train in the process of dodging the enemy. Cue mockBond title sequence and you think to yourself that they've realised just how stupid just how poor just how nonsensical the franchise is in its action infused attitudes to itself that it's had to go down this route of self reflexivity. Later on the film will fall back on similarly constructed idiot action sequences for sake of dramatic involvement thus completely undermining its own point  if there was even one there initially.Leads Samy Naceri and Frdric Diefenthal look bored with their task of playing Daniel the cab driver come good and incompetent French copper milien. They look fed up as if they didn't want to be there as if the film was contractually bound to their starring in the first two and thus their presence in the third film was compulsory. The two share no chemistry as if the second time was enough time spent together doing this and now that we're onto the third outing half the effort will suffice. One sits here and says these are the leads the film actually centres in on milien and his new state of marriage with Emma Wiklund's Petra for the best part of the opening forty minutes all the while sidelining Daniel for milien. Where's the star? Where's the hero from the first two? Where with his razor wit and casual destruction of the highway code for sake of schlock laughs is the reason these films were even popular in the first place? Where's Daniel? When he does make himself known he's bickering with girlfriend Lilly Cotillard whom by this point the series needed more than she needed it following the opposite over his obsession with his taxi and later putting pregnancy tests in his mouth.Daniel's sidelining and milien's subsequent promotion sees the roles reversed from the first two in that one is now very much in a relationship and now apparently takes the reigns for driving the film with the other single and now sidelined as a goofy supporting act. The loose plot is the same bilge recycled from the first two. These Taxi films aren't about story or narrative they're about a bunch of thieves whom just happened to be in town go around robbing places andor kidnapping people and then instigate hijinks from the police officers whom call on the assistance of the aforementioned Daniel. Here a bunch of Chinese villains take on the role of the faceless anonymous foreign bad guys filling in for the Germans and the Japanese whom were both past occupants of said role. Their plan is hatched when mysterious journalist Qui Ling Bai turns up at the police station milien and the reoccurring chief character Gibert Farcy head operations. The threadbear plotting is best highlighted in that if the police ever at all checked for I.D. at any point in the film we wouldn't really have a film.The gang disguise themselves as Santas during this Christmas period at which the film is set an early attempt at supposedly apprehending one of these Santas in a public shopping area resulting in one of many of the film's jokes being set up and executed with an almighty clunk as we correctly predict the Santa is not in fact one of the robbers and in fact is a part of the mall's festive attractions. One thing will lead to another after a drawn out hour or so of the dull leads and their boring respective marital situations culminating in a sequence in which one of them is tied to a chair as a red digital readout ticks down to his supposed demise. Besson and his FrenchPolish directorial stooge Grard Krawczyk know they cannot lump for another road chase to round things off so everybody tanks off to the Swiss Alps for variation set on snow and ice and yes somebody does indeed go through the ice in the tamest of slapstick fashions. I've no problem with chase sequences or car chase sequences but the spectacle of them alone is not enough to invest emotion in we need to give a damn about those involved. Like upon hearing of a new film Besson had a hand in scripting it's just difficult to care anymore.".

The two share no chemistry as if the second time was enough time spent together doing this and now that we're onto the third outing half the effort will suffice. One sits here and says these are the leads the film actually centres in on milien and his new state of marriage with Emma Wiklund's Petra for the best part of the opening forty minutes all the while sidelining Daniel for milien. Where's the star? Where's the hero from the first two? Where with his razor wit and casual destruction of the highway code for sake of schlock laughs is the reason these films were even popular in the first place? Where's Daniel? When he does make himself known he's bickering with girlfriend Lilly Cotillard whom by this point the series needed more than she needed it following the opposite over his obsession with his taxi and later putting pregnancy tests in his mouth.Daniel's sidelining and milien's subsequent promotion sees the roles reversed from the first two in that one is now very much in a relationship and now apparently takes the reigns for driving the film with the other single and now sidelined as a goofy supporting act. The loose plot is the same bilge recycled from the first two. These Taxi films aren't about story or narrative they're about a bunch of thieves whom just happened to be in town go around robbing places andor kidnapping people and then instigate hijinks from the police officers whom call on the assistance of the aforementioned Daniel. Here a bunch of Chinese villains take on the role of the faceless anonymous foreign bad guys filling in for the Germans and the Japanese whom were both past occupants of said role. Their plan is hatched when mysterious journalist Qui Ling Bai turns up at the police station milien and the reoccurring chief character Gibert Farcy head operations. The threadbear plotting is best highlighted in that if the police ever at all checked for I.D. at any point in the film we wouldn't really have a film.The gang disguise themselves as Santas during this Christmas period at which the film is set an early attempt at supposedly apprehending one of these Santas in a public shopping area resulting in one of many of the film's jokes being set up and executed with an almighty clunk as we correctly predict the Santa is not in fact one of the robbers and in fact is a part of the mall's festive attractions. One thing will lead to another after a drawn out hour or so of the dull leads and their boring respective marital situations culminating in a sequence in which one of them is tied to a chair as a red digital readout ticks down to his supposed demise. Besson and his FrenchPolish directorial stooge Grard Krawczyk know they cannot lump for another road chase to round things off so everybody tanks off to the Swiss Alps for variation set on snow and ice and yes somebody does indeed go through the ice in the tamest of slapstick fashions. I've no problem with chase sequences or car chase sequences but the spectacle of them alone is not enough to invest emotion in we need to give a damn about those involved. Like upon hearing of a new film Besson had a hand in scripting it's just difficult to care anymore.";

	schema:reviewBody "I usually try to be objective when I watch films to appreciate their technical merit above all else but in the case of Stepmom I fail. It's exactly the sort of puffy ridiculous Valium that Hollywood shamelessly pumps into growing generations of cynics to brainwash them into the belief that every person in the world is a cuddly fluffy elflike creature and conflict only exists because it's been too long since we all sat down for a singalong around the piano.I know I sound like a terrible cynic for judging this film in this way I am a terrible cynic let's not deny it but it's difficult to swallow this tripe. I come from a  dare I use that devilish phrase  broken home myself and in fact my old man is getting remarried very soon but I still fail to see any resemblance between Chris Columbus' vision of family harmonics and the interpersonal dynamics that exist here on Earth. And by that I refer both to the grating fireandbrimstone conflict at the beginning of the film and the sugary hug fest into which it slowly descends as it progresses.There is however nothing inherently wrong with sugary optimistic scenarios if they are grounded welldriven wellplotted explorations of discovering the light at the end of the tunnel. It's hard for me to put my finger on a perfect example but the most obvious one would have to be the Lord of the Rings trilogy which has nevertheless received a certain quantity of criticism from yours truly for drawing too distinct a line between good and bad. In spite of that trilogy's shortcomings though it's a good example of a goldensunshinelollipops conclusion that is plodded out solidly over a long arduous journey of storytelling.Chris Columbus here dispenses with any nuance of hard work or respect for his audience's intelligence and dishes up a glib emotionally manipulative treat for us to wolf down hungrily starved for happy endings in our cinematic universe of chainsaw massacres and David Lynch.There really isn't a saving grace to this film as far as I can see Its lack of realism obviously renders me incapable of truly appreciating whatever fine qualities it may have but the dialogue is dull performances are average and being such a suburban story there really isn't much room for technical filmmaking brilliance. On top of this every single time I think back on it I get Ain't no Mountain High Enough stuck interminably in my head and that more than anything else is unforgivable.210".

I come from a  dare I use that devilish phrase  broken home myself and in fact my old man is getting remarried very soon but I still fail to see any resemblance between Chris Columbus' vision of family harmonics and the interpersonal dynamics that exist here on Earth. And by that I refer both to the grating fireandbrimstone conflict at the beginning of the film and the sugary hug fest into which it slowly descends as it progresses.There is however nothing inherently wrong with sugary optimistic scenarios if they are grounded welldriven wellplotted explorations of discovering the light at the end of the tunnel. It's hard for me to put my finger on a perfect example but the most obvious one would have to be the Lord of the Rings trilogy which has nevertheless received a certain quantity of criticism from yours truly for drawing too distinct a line between good and bad. In spite of that trilogy's shortcomings though it's a good example of a goldensunshinelollipops conclusion that is plodded out solidly over a long arduous journey of storytelling.Chris Columbus here dispenses with any nuance of hard work or respect for his audience's intelligence and dishes up a glib emotionally manipulative treat for us to wolf down hungrily starved for happy endings in our cinematic universe of chainsaw massacres and David Lynch.There really isn't a saving grace to this film as far as I can see Its lack of realism obviously renders me incapable of truly appreciating whatever fine qualities it may have but the dialogue is dull performances are average and being such a suburban story there really isn't much room for technical filmmaking brilliance. On top of this every single time I think back on it I get Ain't no Mountain High Enough stuck interminably in my head and that more than anything else is unforgivable.210";

Liam Aiken  Jena Malone the kids stand out.On the whole 'Stepmom' is a must watch for each and every cinelover.";

	schema:reviewBody "Stepmom gets off to quite a promising start. Luke Harrison a successful lawyer is divorced and the film depicts the bitterness between his former wife Jackie and his new girlfriend Isabel with Luke himself caught between the two women. Rather surprisingly the part of Luke is a relatively minor one the film concentrates much more on the two women's relationship with each other. The two have quite different personalities. Jackie is a fulltime mother and housewifeshe has two young children by Luke whereas Isabel much the younger of the twohas a successful career as a photographer for an advertising agency. Jackie is rather conservative Isabel more trendy. Jackie for example likes classical music while Isabel is a rock fan.What raises the film in its opening scenes above the ordinary is the subtle way in which the two women are portrayed by Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts. Perhaps unusually for a film of this type the thrusting career woman Isabel is the more sympathetic of the two. For all Jackie's Earth Mother pretensions she comes across as a bitter and rather unpleasant character. Although Isabel was not the other woman in Luke and Jackie's divorce Jackie nevertheless resents her presence in Luke's life and uses her children as a weapon in her battle. The children particularly the girl Anna do not get on with Isabel and Jackie never misses an opportunity to encourage them in their dislike.The film's turningpoint comes when Luke proposes to Isabel and at about the same time Jackie is diagnosed with cancer. Jackie realises that Isabel will be playing a permanent role in her children's life and as her own disease might prove fatal that in future Isabel may possibly be the only mother the children will have. The rest of the film tells the story of how the two women come to terms with and learn to respect one another.Unfortunately the film starts to decline from this turningpoint onward. The pace becomes fatally slow and a potentially interesting story of the tensions arising upon the breakup of a family unit descends into soap opera. I sometimes wonder what scriptwriters would do without terminal illness to rely on as a plot device. It is however a difficult device to use successfully most films that rely upon it fall into the trap of maudlin sentimentality. Stepmom is perhaps better than some but this is largely due to the skill of the three main leads Roberts Sarandon and Ed Harris as Luke. There is little in the script that would distinguish the film from the average disease of the month TV movie except that a TV movie would perhaps move at a faster pace and would not draw out the agony to such an extent. 510".

The first client of the movie is a Carry On newcomer Richard O'Callaghan a solid replacement for Jim Dale who had recently left the series. Sid takes down his information and the machine pops out Joan Sims. Sid rejects it but Hattie makes him set up a date. Kenneth Williams plays Mr. Snooper a marriage counselor. He is a bachelor and he gives bad advice to the couples. He is told to get married to keep his job. Sid decides to intercept Joan Sims because he likes her. Hattie calls Charles Hawtrey to follow him. Jacki Piper makes her appearance in the bar where all the meetings are supposed to take place. She plays Sally Martin who is an up and coming star. Ricahrd mistakes her as his date and she mistakes him as a publicity agent who is to take photos of her. Jacki looks gorgeous in a very short dress. He wants to have dinner and she wants to go to her place and do ittake photos. There is a lot of dialog confusing sex and photos. she tells him she is going to strip down and he gets nervous. She is just planning to take photos. Charles continues to follow Sid as he leaves the bar. We hear the Hitchcock theme in the background. Good music and a fun scene as Sid eludes him. Back to Jacki and Richard. Jacki comes wearing a pink nightie and a black bra and panties. Wow! There are a few more lines of play and she disrobes. She does a nice little spin to show off that perfect body. She finally realizes he is not a photographer and they tell each other what they are there for. He runs out embarrassed. Jacki Piper has no ego and does not come across as hey look at my body which I really love. She is so sweet and proper and looks so hot in her undies. Kenneth meets with Hattie about getting married. After that Sid meets with Joan at her apartment Bernard Bresselaw shows up as her wrestler boyfriend. Then Richard shows up to meet her as his date. Sid escapes and Richard is thrown out. Jacki calls the next day to find out he is in the hospital for his wounds. She is wearing another short skirt and she meets him at the hospital. They have a funny scene where they discuss their night and the man in the next bed is totally amazed at what he hears. Hattie decides to match herself with Kenneth because Sid likes Joan. Later Terry Scott is matched up with Jacki's new roommate Imogen Hasall. He tries to make love to her and people keep interrupting. Jacki comes out again in her underwear and walks around. She looks perfect again. She is incredible. Anyway at the end all the couples get together and have a big food fight. What a great way to end this funny and fun film. What an underrated gem.".

Jacki Piper has no ego and does not come across as hey look at my body which I really love. She is so sweet and proper and looks so hot in her undies. Kenneth meets with Hattie about getting married. After that Sid meets with Joan at her apartment Bernard Bresselaw shows up as her wrestler boyfriend. Then Richard shows up to meet her as his date. Sid escapes and Richard is thrown out. Jacki calls the next day to find out he is in the hospital for his wounds. She is wearing another short skirt and she meets him at the hospital. They have a funny scene where they discuss their night and the man in the next bed is totally amazed at what he hears. Hattie decides to match herself with Kenneth because Sid likes Joan. Later Terry Scott is matched up with Jacki's new roommate Imogen Hasall. He tries to make love to her and people keep interrupting. Jacki comes out again in her underwear and walks around. She looks perfect again. She is incredible. Anyway at the end all the couples get together and have a big food fight. What a great way to end this funny and fun film. What an underrated gem.";

	schema:headline " Dated but fun and underrated Carry On!";
	schema:reviewBody "Though variable in quality and quite dated Carry On Loving hit contemporary times perfectly in this mildly risqu offering. Here the team are entering into the spirit of more liberal times something director Gerald Thomas and producer Peter Rogers intended to loosely draw upon.Carry On Loving is similar in content to an earlier addition in the series 'Regardless' 1960 with a series of sketches all connected a to a fraudulent dating agency run by Sid James and Hattie Jacques. Their characters Sid and Sophie Bliss are a couple who pretend they're married as a ploy to make their shoddy dating agency look more genuine than it actually is. They have a wide variation of clients on their database such as a bachelor who just so happens to be a marriage guidance councilor who is seeking a girlfriend and a young naieve man who's desperate to lose his virginity. Some may argue that the formula of the Carry On's was beginning to wear a little thin at this stage but despite a few nondescript scenes where the pace becomes a little tedious on occasions it is overall highly entertaining ending with a fun cake fight scene where the cast are all gathered together in one big mass ceremony finale that despite its lack of originality makes for a classic ending.Some of the regulars on show in this offering are looking a little older now while some are unfairly restricted to minor supporting turns. Sid James is basically Sid James beefing up his usual masculine charms on any woman that takes his fancy mainly Joan Sims while Hattie Jacques who always brought a sense of grace with her inimitable characterisations plays his pretend wife Sophie and shares some sparkling scenes with both Sid James and Kenneth Williams.Joan Sims is unfairly pigeonholed in a supporting though effective role as the amorous spinster Esme Crowfoot who lives in the constant shadow of her fierce partner known as Gripper Burke as he's a wrestler. Joan Sims shares some fun scenes with Sid James and has one hysterical one with Kenneth Williams towards the climax of the film.Kenneth Williams is another stalwart of the series who is surprisingly restricted to a supporting role as the typically pompous yet inefficient marriage guidance councilor Percival Snooper. His superior demands for him to become married after a series of complaints from his clients who all believe he knows nothing about married life which is evidently true. He quickly succumbs to the advances of the formidable Hattie Jacques.Charles Hawtrey turns up as a private investigator hot on the trail of Sid James following Hattie Jacques suspicions of his shady relationship with Joan Sims. While he is as amusing as always he is also given limited screen time and doesn't feel like a real participant in the film having very little interaction with any of his fellow Carry On colleagues.Terry Scott who had appeared in various Carry On entries plays Terence Philpott an accidentprone man with a youthful innocence resurrecting a role that was seemingly tailormade for Jim Dale. He gets to play some great scenes opposite Imogen Hassall whom is wonderfully transformed from dowdy into a luscious beauty. The scenes they share when Terry Scott goes to visit her for the first time at her family's stately home are of significant comic value and Joan Hickson turns up in a fantastic cameo here playing the stern nononsense mother. There's also the fun sequence of the two trying to enjoy a quiet night in together but are continually disturbed by the rest of his girlfriends flatmates and their trivial domestic matters.Jaki Piper who had previously starred in 'Up The Jungle' plays a model who through a comic misunderstanding ends up meeting and falling in love with the dopey and accidentprone Richard O' Callaghan. Their is some nice scenes between the two as their romance steadily builds up.Other Carry On players that show up include Bernard Bresslaw as the manic wrestler Gripper Burke and also a great role here for Patsy Rolands who sparkles in all of her few number of scenes as the dowdy housekeeper of Percival Snooper Kenneth Williams. Feeling threatened that her job will come to an end after Percival announces to her that he will be marrying Sophie Bliss she hilariously does her very best to split the two up after it becomes blatantly obvious that she is in fact in love with him herself. The transformation of her from dowdy to glam is fantastically played by Patsy Rolands in possibly her best role in a Carry On film.Though by no means is this one of the best but Carry On Loving overall is still definitely worth a look and really captures a certain era the dawn of the swinging seventies impeccably well. It's just a shame that this film is so underrated. Ian Phillips".

	schema:reviewBody "Sex is all the rage in the small city of Much SnoggingontheGreen with everyone talking about it doing it or talking about doing it. In the midst of all this the Wedded Bliss computer dating agency uses computer technology to try and bring together those unlucky enough not to be getting any. Meanwhile the unmarried Percival Snooper dispenses marital guidance for those unlucky enough to be already hitched.A review by TC Raymond on this very site suggests that this isn't a prime candidate for the best in the series but goes on to say how good it is. Of course I agree strongly with that specific statement if not his overall opinion. Of course Loving is not up there as the best of the series and the reason for this is because it is actually at the other end of the scale with the Carry On films made in the 1970's that generally saw the series lose touch with the spoofs and wit of the better films such as Khyber for example. The plot is a series of doubleentendres sexual misunderstandings and people talking at cross purposes. You see the big joke is that they sound like they're talking about sex but really they're not  oh my splitting sides. Now I'm not against a bit of that I'm bl00dy doing it now but it doesn't make a film on its own and sadly this is the majority of the comedy and there is little else here. I barely laughed once I think but I suppose those that think the Confessions films are the height of comedy will like this and find value in it.The cast are mostly poor. O'Callaghan made me realise just how good Jim Dale was because the former is pretty awful in the character often played by the latter. James is always good at the sort of lecherous character he is given here and he is amusing. Williams is his usual self but his material is weak and he deserves better as indeed many of them do. Sims and Jacques play the clichd women's roles while Piper is the totty. At least Hassall is different from the usual female character within this series. Small turns from Scott Bresslaw and a few others don't add that much.Overall then a pretty poor film which is sadly where the Carry On series found itself as it lurched towards its death in the 1970's. Viewers who love saucy postcards and smutty jokes may find some value in it but for the majority I suspect it is too basic and obvious to be worth watching. Befitting the quality of the script the whole thing ends in one big messy pile which is a pretty good summary of the quality of the whole affair if you ask me and yes I know you didn't.".

There are shades of CARRY ON REGARDLESS here with the agency setting but this is very much a film of its era and the 1970s look and feel is priceless. Castwise James and Jacques are solid and enjoyable but it's the minor players who really shine in this one.I'm not usually a fan of Terry Scott but his set piece scene in Joan Hickson's house is the highlight here.

Charles Hawtrey bags the second funniest moment with his incident in the gents. Peter Butterworth is limited to a onescene cameo but makes the very best of it while Bernard Bresslaw has a wonderful largerthanlife role as a wrestler.

	schema:headline " Average Carry On film with a few good laughs";
	schema:reviewBody "As the 1970s arrived the era of fairly innocent Carry On films has gone. Sex isn't just hinted at it is the driving force of the story. Sid James and Hattie Jacques run the 'Wedded Bliss' dating agency where prospective couples are matched using the latest in computer technology at least that is what the customers are led to believe in reality Sid puts the completed forms in the slot and it goes through to the back room where Hattie puts a form for the opposite sex in another slot. Unsurprisingly the agency doesn't have the best result at least not the way they intend. One innocent young man goes out with the wrong woman after she mistakes him for the photographer who is due to take racy pictures of her and another finds himself at the house of a girl whose family are about as much fun as a funeral of course when he bumps into her again when she has become a glamorous model things are different! Other jokes include Joan Sims wrestler boy friend who gets very jealous of any man who gets near her and a marriage guidance councillor who is told he must get married himself if he is to keep his job. There was also a nice running gag where characters kept bumping into an amorous couple they had nothing to do with the plot but provided a chuckle.I didn't expect this to all that good as most later Carry On films are comparatively weak thankfully it wasn't that bad indeed it had far more laughs than I'd expected. Sid James did a good job as Sidney Bliss manager of the agency and Hattie Jacques was fine as his partner Sophie. Kenneth Williams was somewhat underused as the marriage guidance councillor although his character did have a very funny scene alongside Joan Sims who was also rather good in this. The rest of the team did good enough jobs as did those who aren't regular Carry On actors in particular Richard O'Callaghan who plays the young man looking for his first girlfriend... although he is nowhere near as good as Jim Dale who'd typically be given this role before he left the series. Over all this was far from the worst in the series even though it isn't a contender for the best not by quite a way if you are a fan of the series it is worth watching although some parents might find it far less suitable for children than the earlier films.".

One innocent young man goes out with the wrong woman after she mistakes him for the photographer who is due to take racy pictures of her and another finds himself at the house of a girl whose family are about as much fun as a funeral of course when he bumps into her again when she has become a glamorous model things are different! Other jokes include Joan Sims wrestler boy friend who gets very jealous of any man who gets near her and a marriage guidance councillor who is told he must get married himself if he is to keep his job. There was also a nice running gag where characters kept bumping into an amorous couple they had nothing to do with the plot but provided a chuckle.I didn't expect this to all that good as most later Carry On films are comparatively weak thankfully it wasn't that bad indeed it had far more laughs than I'd expected. Sid James did a good job as Sidney Bliss manager of the agency and Hattie Jacques was fine as his partner Sophie. Kenneth Williams was somewhat underused as the marriage guidance councillor although his character did have a very funny scene alongside Joan Sims who was also rather good in this. The rest of the team did good enough jobs as did those who aren't regular Carry On actors in particular Richard O'Callaghan who plays the young man looking for his first girlfriend... although he is nowhere near as good as Jim Dale who'd typically be given this role before he left the series. Over all this was far from the worst in the series even though it isn't a contender for the best not by quite a way if you are a fan of the series it is worth watching although some parents might find it far less suitable for children than the earlier films.";

	schema:reviewBody "With the famous British sex based comedy series heading into the 1970's naturally things were going to get a little ruder due to things like Emmanuelle and more pornography available but luckily this film is bearable and not grim viewing. Basically the Wedded Bliss dating agency is specialised in bringing together lonely single people that want to find that special someone and obviously get married very quickly. Owner Sidney Bliss Sid James is recently having complications with his work partner and fake business wife Sophie Plummett Hattie Jacques becoming very paranoid and argumentative but he is determined to keep things going. We obviously see the strange people who are visiting the dating agency looking for love and more these include seamstress Esme Crowfoot Joan Sims confirmed bachelor and marriage councillor Percival Snooper Kenneth Williams timid and nervous Bertrum Muffet Richard O'Callaghan and Terence Philpot Terry Scott. Bertrum manages to get a blind date but confuses his actual date partner with model Sally Martin Jacki Piper Terry manages to find a beautiful big breasted mate with Jenny Grubb Imogen Hassall but cannot get the moment to seduce her and Esme finds herself a partner but has to keep him from original boxer boyfriend Gripper Burke Bernard Bresslaw. While all this is going Sidney is unaware that Sophie may still have feelings for him but with her angry nature she hires private eye James Bedsop Charles Hawtrey to follow him and his activities. In the end all the happy couples including a reformed Sidney and Sophie are brought together for a celebratory dinner filled with loads of cream cakes and some arguing turns into a mass food fight. As always the cast play the parts we have become used to it's a little annoying Barbara Windsor isn't featuring but you can forgive it because of all the actually surprisingly funny sexualised antics and close to the mark innuendos and doubleentendre jokes we adore I can slightly see why the critics give it two stars out of five but personally I think it is a fun and near worthwhile comedy. Okay!".

The story takes place against a background of prejudice as the couple find themselves rejected by mainstream society while being helped by outsiders such as Sam who runs a saloon and gives them a room after they are evicted from their rented house.The strongest parts of the film are those that take place during WWII when the Nazis occupied Holland and Rika and Waldemar find themselves interned in Nazi labor camps. However the movie never seems to go beyond a depiction of events to give us a deeper insight into the culture of the times.

	schema:reviewBody "Nearly six years ago in the summer I was camping and visiting some relatives at their vacation trailer and happened to walk in one day while Mercury Rising was being watched. By that time they were well into the film perhaps more than half way through but I watched the rest. I'm not exactly sure how much I liked it at the time but didn't see anything severely wrong with it. Last night I watched the whole movie for the first time. Knowing it wasn't the most widely praised film and that I have higher standards than I did six years ago I had fairly low expectations but after that I can't say I dislike it.A very complex code called Mercury has been created by the NSA one which is believed to be impossible to break. However the code has been put in a puzzle magazine as a test to see if this is true and a nine year old autistic boy in Chicago named Simon Lynch who likes to solve puzzles manages to break it. The NSA receives a call from this boy and the two agents who have received the call inform their boss Nicholas Kudrow. Kudrow is afraid of the code being spread around so he sends an assassin to kill the boy! The assassin comes to Simon's house and kills his parents but cannot find the boy himself and flees when he hears the police coming! An FBI agent named Art Jeffries is sent to investigate and he finds Simon hiding in a closet. After taking the boy away Art must protect him and try to keep him from the assassins which will be difficult as he doesn't have too many people on his side and keeping Simon in one place in sometimes a challenge! I'm not sure exactly how to explain my feelings about this movie. Around the beginning it seemed pretty much average but it gradually got better. I was pretty shocked at the scene where Simon's parents are killed and not in a good way. Some probably many people have criticised Mercury Rising for being so unrealistic and clichd and I'm not going to argue with that but I can't say I think it's a bad movie. As usual Bruce Willis puts on a memorable performance this time as FBI agent Art Jeffries a likable character and thenchild actor Miko Hughes is also impressive as Simon. Playing the role of an autistic character probably wasn't easy but it seems Hughes managed to pull it off. For me it was reasonably suspenseful seeing the two characters on the run together. The film has very memorable and touching ending as well one which I remembered from the first time.No this certainly isn't the most popular action thriller ever made nor does it deserve to be but worse has been done. I honestly thought I would have more critical things to say about Mercury Rising but I don't and it seems many of those who don't like it have given good reasons why they don't probably better reasons than I can give for praising it. Since this 1998 action thriller is so polarizing I guess there's no guarantee whether you'll like it or not unless you don't like action thrillers in general then you obviously wouldn't like it. However if you're a fan of this genre you like good though maybe mindless action there's a chance Mercury Rising will do as long as you're not expecting a masterpiece.".

Mercury Rising I was happy with and entertained which was what this government coverup story was all about. As the sort of troubled outcast on somewhat goodterms Willis is a master. This is a lockfit for him he does it so well and on the other hand he slips out and accomplishes other performances with just the same skill. I.e. The Sixth Sense 1999 creepygood story that he brings that Ole' Willis insight to and gives a leveled measure of believable acting that makes you say Wow. This given I liked the original working title to the film Mercury Falling would have worked well too. The autistic boy Miko  is really outstanding at bringing in the overunder balanced brain of Autism to understated believability. He brought that character to it's living end. That is impressive for such young actors to have so much meddle that they can use in their craft. Then there is the one who makes 'hating heavies' a way of life Alec Baldwin who always can appear meaner that a bull rattle snake. His F.B.I man is as solid and scary as the I would think the real mean ones come. All in all fairness this lacked totally connecting everything for a perfect film but if you watch it uninterrupted and settle in to enjoy what this is you should get a lot of story entertainment out of it no problem. There is a lot of garbage made these days and it is refreshing to see a story that you can watch and take something else away the next viewing as well. Bruce has the juice...

Not that they are a complete waste but they are for fans only.I work with children who have autism so I naturally like the fact that they are featured and hope that it helps people understand the disease a little more. So it was a good story for me and Willis' acting with the boy probably got him the role in The Sixth Sense.Alec Baldwin plays the government official you love to hate as he is effective in displaying why we distrust the government so much. Hope that comment doesn't get me sent to Guantanamo.Maybe not entirely realistic but good job by Willis and a good thriller.".

I saw most of the movie last night and I finished it this morning. I thought I would like it I loved it. I compared it to movies such as Firewall and 16 Blocks. I came to the conclusion that it was better than both of them. Bruce Willis does a very good job at playing the movie's caring and FBI hero. Alec Baldwin has a good onscreen presence as the villain who goes overboard when a government secret is exposed. Miko Hughes who I recognized from Full House does a great job as the autistic kid that the hero takes under his wing. Finally Bruce Willis and Miko Hughes have a great onscreen chemistry together. After I finished watching the movie I watched Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert review the movie. I thought at least one of them would have agreed with me. Then I read Ebert's full review where he talked about the villain's predictable death. The death involves him being wounded by the hero and then tumbling off the top of the building. He didn't complain when it was used in Hollywood Homicide because he liked that movie. I however love that clich and welcome it with open arms. The film may have been overlooked by the critics but it was not overlooked by audiences. I highly recommend Mercury Rising.".

	schema:headline " Not a great film but a great performance by Miko Hughes";
	schema:reviewBody "There are two great acting performances in this film. Bruce Willis plays Art Jeffries an FBI agent with attitude. Miko Hughes plays Simon Lynch an autistic savant with a gift for codebreaking. Both are believable but Miko Hughes is astonishing  one of the best ever screen performances by a child. The scenes between the pair of them are really touching and you can believe that Willis really likes kids. Perhaps he does.The US government's pursuit of Lynch in this film may at first appear overly farfetched and scaremongering. Then you remember the US attitude towards the British savant Gary McKinnon who was accused of perpetrating the biggest military computer hack of all time by hacking into 97 US military and NASA computers in 2002. Well they didn't kill his mum and dad and hunt him like an animal. But after 10 years of attempted extradition and speculation of a 70year jail term maybe this story is just an exaggeration of reality and not quite as ridiculous as some commentators have suggested.It's not really a downside but if you come to this film expecting a shootemup action movie you may be disappointed. It's much more than that and consequently slower  it's a touching drama with action scenes and so we can forgive just about the pace through the middle of the film. The writing is actually very good and Pearson Konner and Rosenthal all deserve credit.I did find the score a bit distracting. Sort of 'too big' and too 'James Bond' for the film. Scenes without music were better. Though the music being played at the club Jeffries visits was really good and I would have liked to have heard more of Koko Taylor now no longer with us belting out some blues.I was finding it difficult to see where this film was going. When Wills is with a kid like in 16 blocks or Die Hard 4 you expect a visible end point and there wasn't one. There was a sense of going around in circles. Until the last 5 minutes. Ultimately that cost it a couple of stars and the score lost another one. So seven out of ten for this.".

Yes the idea of the government putting out a hitwith rather sloppy killers at that on a kid for a code is sillybesides what if another one cracks it? How high a bodycount is acceptable exactly?. Look past those aspects. I haven't watched anything else by this director except for Malice which was also a nice piece of work. This is put together quite well with the editing and cinematography building tension and doing a decent job of conveying Simon's ability. I've had experiences with Autistic people of different ages and varied severity of condition and the depiction here is convincing and fairly respectfuldo note that far from all who have the syndrome are as distant andor helpless on their own as seen here and this serves to explain and demystify it a tadcertainly more than I remember Rain Man doing. Miko researched for his role and he does a great job. Willis is goodwhen isn't he? and they do well together. Baldwin is as delightfully detestable as we know he can be. There is a nice amount of talent in the cast if not all of it is allowed to shine. Granted there could be more action. There is a little brutal bloody violence in this. I recommend this to fans of thrillers. 610".

Fundamentally though it is fundamentally a film about the existentially condition of life about living in the now enjoying life and love to the full and as such is very successful. Humor and sexuality are both used with good effect to demonstrate the temporal and immediate nature of human existence. You laugh you cry you get horny you listen to the strange songs and you think about the nature of our short lives on this earth.The cinematography is very good the pale and low contrast images capture the landscape particularly the water very well.All in all a true pearl of a movie!".

Kappa is like the Japanese version of the Creature from the Black Lagoon but it has long history in Japanese folklore and there's even speculation that it was an interpretation by the ancient Japanese eye witness of an alien visitation. Kappa appears in other movies such as Great Yokai Wars and is a popular character in Japanese psyche.The movie is sort of a love story. Kappa in question is a rebirth of Chage's old school mate that died from drowning. It seems that he came back to save Chage from certain death that is going to happen in few days.In some ways this movie is a study in effective movie making. For such a low budget 100k movie it holds up to movies that were created with more financial resources. But still how the creators from Germany and Japan came together to create this movie is bit of a mystery.Kind of a cool project movie. It's done with outstanding skillfulness considering the resource and time that went into its shooting 6 days.I'm looking forward to see more movies from the producers of this movie.".

Sure their approach to music and fame is comparable to a Bmovie but I still think that their talent was largely wasted. The movie's strong points are its warm heartedness an interesting display of nature  the leaves of the aquatic plants surely leave an impression the fact that we can develop sympathy for its main characters and its purposeful embrace of a kitsch aesthetic. But sometimes the purposeful kitsch isn't enough to compensate the lack of production values. I think that the sketchy characterizations of the mythical creatures kappa are enjoyable the sexual interaction with kappa and humans is very funny but the movie suffers from the lack of crew talent and the apparent nonbudget. For instance the switches from regular acting to the musical numbers seem forced as there isn't much change from camera angle scenario whatever... The actors often seem like they don't know how to diversify their dancing act and as they are not singing the songs but only dancing they are often caught with a somewhat stupid expression like i'm sorry i can't dance very well. Also I have never seen an erotic film even one that is only vaguely erotic with such an unattractive lead female character well and the same could be said about the male.... Sawa Masaki really isn't a beautiful woman and you don't want to see her naked at best you can tolerate it. She's not a great actress either. There is another sex scene with the main kappa and a prostitute that seems to be thrown in for the sake of giving the viewers some diversity and a better looking actress. I enjoyed the scene it is sexy and funny but it looks like an adhoc plot arrangement. That said it surely is a curious movie reasonably entertaining and worth watching if you're a fan of Stereo Total weird movies in general or Japanese weirdity in particular not so much if you're looking for Asian erotica.".

The tone is rather gritty but although there's not a lot of outright comedy the movie does still have a sense of humour.

	schema:reviewBody "After constantly reading and hearing nothing but negative opinions about the American produced but also filmed in Hong Kong Jackie Chan vehicle 'The Protector'. It didn't sway me from checking it out. I'm no Jackie Chan fan but honestly it was director James Glickenhaus' name which fed my interest. Best known for the 80s exploitative vigilante flick 'The Exterminator 1980' and some entertaining action joints 'The Soldier 1982' and 'Shakedown 1985. 'The Protector' does have the same vibe of his early efforts gritty brutal rough and seamy. And I would call it lesser work. However the main talking point will always be how Glickenhaus used Jackie Chan. Yes Chan is wasted in a role that would've been better suited for someone else Norris comes to mind as it has more in common with his stuff as his martial arts abilities and amusing characteristics are never truly capitalized on. I'm so use to seeing him with that wink wink attitude Project A and piling on those extravagantly energypacked stunt work Police Story. It's a different kettle and very atypical. Here he looks uncomfortable throughout with that hardboiled edge. Just listen to his sober delivery of the dialogues. That endearing personality is kept in check. This performance seemed to ask more on dramatic acting than his psychical and lively talent. He's pairing up with Danny Aiello a loutish cop couldn't be anymore disjointed and unbelievable. The chemistry never felt right but with these problems I still was mesmerized. The rest of the performances Bill Wallace Roy Chiao were indifferent. Look out for a short appearance by Mike Starr. While it didn't have the ongoing rush I was expecting Chan gets some furious and hardhitting action sequences like the opening slowmotion bloody shootout tricky boat chase one by water and the other by foot and a marvellous skyhigh balancing act. The film doesn't start off too badly but when it hits Honk Kong. The copy and paste formula with its many predictable outcomes involving the seedy crime underworld and the buddy style of two rogue cops seems to plod along rather coldly. At least there's something enticing about the moody Hong Kong scenery and ace cinematographer Mark Irwin's crisp moving camerawork is expansively fleshedout. Effectively detailing the backdrop. Glickenhaus' direction is scratchy but he knows how to setup street style locations and infuse sleaze especially the opportunities that arose to squeeze in nudity. It cops a lot shtick but without the expectations it's a passable odd of sorts.".

His early Hollywood films stuck him in the same movies that were being packaged for  Stallone or Chuck Norris. There is nothing about Chan's character in this movie that requires the character to be Asian except for his being the star. In his Hong Kong films Chan is never dull with the movies being one rapidfire martial arts sequence after another but The Protector is lifeless throughout. Danny Aiello isn't given much to work with either and the lacking chemistry between the two probably is more a result of the script and direction than how the two actors got on together. Both have been better in worse movies. The best thing about the movie is the Hong Kong settings. The worst part is the appalling way that Jackie Chan comes off so colorless and drab. It wouldn't be until the madeinCanada Rumble in the Bronx that the west would finally figure out how to make a good Jackie Chan movie.".

In his Hong Kong films Chan is never dull with the movies being one rapidfire martial arts sequence after another but The Protector is lifeless throughout. Danny Aiello isn't given much to work with either and the lacking chemistry between the two probably is more a result of the script and direction than how the two actors got on together. Both have been better in worse movies. The best thing about the movie is the Hong Kong settings. The worst part is the appalling way that Jackie Chan comes off so colorless and drab. It wouldn't be until the madeinCanada Rumble in the Bronx that the west would finally figure out how to make a good Jackie Chan movie.";

I think Jackie bashed the movie himself because it was a flop.This was an above average 80's action copbuddy movie with some very expensive action scenes. In NY harbor they blew up 2 boats and in HK they blew up a helicopter. The fights were good to excellent including a Jackie fight with legendary MMA fighter Bill Wallace and a crazy fight in a massage parlor and that is just off the top of my head. Probably my favorite scene is the fight and chase scene in Kowloon harbor on the water itself where a population of boat people live year round. He does 2 death defying stunts in that scene alone one involving a motorcross bike and one with a long pole.It was not a typical Jackie flick because Jackie curses a lot and is seemed to be a cocky womanizer and there is a lot of nudity in this movie and it wasn't a comedy. His acting wasn't bad and i thought his chemistry with Danny Aiello was pretty good too.Personally i am a huge fan of Jackies being that i think i saw just about all his movies including some bad ones went he was just starting out in the early 70's and as a fan i'm glad he switched to a new role in this movie...and i don't know but there is just something about this movie that makes me watch it again and again. People ripped the endsong and i thought there was nothing wrong and it was a good song.It doesn't hurt that the gorgeous Moon Lee is in the movie too! All in all this is probably in my higher selection of Jackie movies that i like. When and if you do watch this movie know that this is not a typical Jackie movie and just start from there and i hope you will like this movie also.".

The HK version has added scenes with Sally Yeh that actually make no sense as far as the plot goes. Plus it is strange listening to the American actors speaking perfect Cantonese! This movie was actually ahead of it's time because it seems to have influenced a lot of the gangster movies of the '90s.

	schema:headline " Criminally underrated Jackie Chan action  one of his best American movies";
	schema:reviewBody "This unfairly neglected '80s buddybuddy cop flick sees Jackie Chan in his second American role after the lesser BATTLE CREEK BRAWL. THE PROTECTOR is generally regarded as one of the star's worst movies especially by the man himself but I'm pleased to say that now I've seen it I can say otherwise. This is an entertaining violent and actionpacked movie and it's easy to see why Chan himself doesn't care for it  the copious blood and nudity and bad language is a far way from his modernday familyfriendly action star persona. Indeed it certainly seems strange to hear Chan speak such lines so that's a novel experience in itself.The plot itself is wafer thin but makes some good use of American and Hong Kong onthestreet locations which get the gritty atmosphere across really well. It's business as usual as the two cops go headtohead against a drug lord who's kidnapped his rival's daughter and along the way exploitation director James Glickenhaus throws in loads of pointless but wellshot action sequences and nude women who have no reason to be naked. Glickenhaus famously fell out with Chan and refused to let him shoot the martial arts sequences but even so they're surprisingly good with Chan at the physical pinnacle of his career on the same kind of top form we saw in POLICE STORY. Many scenes are cheesy and hilariously over the top like the bit where a robber is shotgunned out of a window but it's that kind of movie and impossible to dislike. There seems to be some kind of Bond influence going on here with some largescale stunts and lots of chases my favourite being the fight on a platform supported by a huge crane and the cheesy death of the ubervillain has to be seen to be believed.Danny Aiello does his best as Chan's partner but he's completely overshadowed by the Chinese star plus he's given a really obnoxious selfish and rude character to work with so definitely not a film to see him in a good light. Roy Chiao makes for an imposing villain but is underused whilst Bill Superfoot Wallace is GREAT as the chief bad guy who kicks Jackie's backside in the finale and ends up using an anglegrinder on our hero! Amazing spectacle here and certainly the highlight of the entire movie well worth the wait. Ignore the negative connections surrounding this movie and I'd recommend giving it a chance  you might find yourself enjoying it more than you thought.".

Tying her kidnapping to the nefarious Hong Kong crime lord Harold Ko Chiao Wong and Garoni travel all the way from their home base in New York City to Hong Kong to rescue Laura and bring down the criminal enterprise of Ko. While there they team up with some unlikely allies Stan Jones Ballistic director Kim Bass and Soo Ling Lee. Will they achieve their mission and not destroy Hong Kong in the process? Find out today! We really loved The Protector. It's classic 80's fun all the way with no shortage of action. Not only does the movie look great thanks to its excellent cinematography but it truly is Jackie Chan as you've never seen him before. We can see why he and director Glickenhaus had a falling out over differing visions but without giving away any spoilers you just have to check out the scene between Jackie and none other than Big John Studd. It's amazing. In the New York City scenes there are some great shots of the World Trade Center towers that add another layer of nostalgia. But besides the WTC there's also a great example of a WYC a White Yelling Chief that is. The entertainment value never lets up.This movie was released at the height of Glickenhaus' powers as a director  we can see why Golden Harvest wanted to do a deal with him. He was smart enough to give action fans all of what they want and none of what they don't. There's no stupid annoying kid there's no stupid annoying romance it's just one supercool action setpiece after another with Jackie doing what he does best. What more could you want? Plus we get to see a slimmer Danny Aiello teamed with Jackie Chan. This truly was a onceinalifetime pairup. We thought they made a great team. Aiello wears a red jacket with no shirt but with a medallion which was a cool style for the day and he's familiar with Hong Kong in the film because he was in Vietnam and they used to go there for R  R.The Protector is a winner  it's just wildly enjoyable fun from beginning to end. Featuring the song One Up For the Good Guys by Chip Taylor we strongly recommend The Protector.".

Tying her kidnapping to the nefarious Hong Kong crime lord Harold Ko Chiao Wong and Garoni travel all the way from their home base in New York City to Hong Kong to rescue Laura and bring down the criminal enterprise of Ko. While there they team up with some unlikely allies Stan Jones Ballistic director Kim Bass and Soo Ling Lee. Will they achieve their mission and not destroy Hong Kong in the process? Find out today! We really loved The Protector. It's classic 80's fun all the way with no shortage of action. Not only does the movie look great thanks to its excellent cinematography but it truly is Jackie Chan as you've never seen him before. We can see why he and director Glickenhaus had a falling out over differing visions but without giving away any spoilers you just have to check out the scene between Jackie and none other than Big John Studd. It's amazing. In the New York City scenes there are some great shots of the World Trade Center towers that add another layer of nostalgia. But besides the WTC there's also a great example of a WYC a White Yelling Chief that is. The entertainment value never lets up.This movie was released at the height of Glickenhaus' powers as a director  we can see why Golden Harvest wanted to do a deal with him. He was smart enough to give action fans all of what they want and none of what they don't. There's no stupid annoying kid there's no stupid annoying romance it's just one supercool action setpiece after another with Jackie doing what he does best. What more could you want? Plus we get to see a slimmer Danny Aiello teamed with Jackie Chan. This truly was a onceinalifetime pairup. We thought they made a great team. Aiello wears a red jacket with no shirt but with a medallion which was a cool style for the day and he's familiar with Hong Kong in the film because he was in Vietnam and they used to go there for R  R.The Protector is a winner  it's just wildly enjoyable fun from beginning to end. Featuring the song One Up For the Good Guys by Chip Taylor we strongly recommend The Protector.";

This is another action spectacular flick from Glickenhaus who knows how to make bigger than life action movies. The Protector has a lot of qualities about it and in spite of Chan's real hate for this film this is one I'd rather opt to watch than his other chop suey comic style ones. The action sequences in this film that really get us exhausted watching Jackie especially in the last one are fantastically shot. After being suspended for not playing by the rules when avenging his partner in the first great action piece my favorite involving a speedboat chase Chan's New York cop Billy Wong is demoted to crowd control for a high fashion show. Here the beautiful daughter of the company is kidnapped and it's up to Chan and likable sidekick Aiello to retrieve her which leads em' to Hong Kong for business and a bit of dangerous if near fatal pleasure involving some sexy young and deadly masseurs where another great action piece evolves. This movie is heavy on action. It has almost everything even a drug lab full of totally nude Asian women. This is a bit of a cheeky action movie as how it lets a bit of female anatomy seep through one thing I strongly admire about it and Chan barely has time to stop and rest fighting baddies and impressing us with some of his stunts. The movie too has an interesting unrelated start involving thugs stripping a truck and making of with off the Texan's guy's computers. Aiello and Chan make an interesting team in a interesting choice of casting. They work well off each other and though this film isn't at the top of Jackie's hit parade The Protector is an action movie that delivers on all levels too with a bit of guilty cheek and humor. Don't be put off with the bad reviews please. Watch for Mike Starr as Thug 2 in the first action sequence.".

The film is awful. Anybody who has seen THE SOLDIER will know that what Glickenhaus lacks in logic he makes up for in style but this really is bad. Everything is so sloppy and lazy. It's downright silly and insulting at times. Chan playing a Dirty Harrytype character is good for a giggle especially the moment where he takes a boat to chase some psycho who killed his partner. The boat owner isn't too enthusiastic on giving it to him so Chan shoves a gun into his face and In awkward English says Give me the fking keys! It might sound like nothing but ifwhen you see this movie you'll see what I mean. I have seen the US version the Asian release was refilmed and reedited by Chan and apparently corrects many of the problems I've mentioned. See that instead.".

	schema:headline " The best sequel theatrical cut is my second peronal favorite Superman sequel of all time";
	schema:reviewBody "Superman II 1980 Richard Lester version in my opinion is the best sequel of all time. The romance and two story's in the film makes it a good and heart in the film. It is my second personal favorite film in the franchise. I love that the film was made in the 80's and I am huge fan with Superman I and II so yes it is my second favorite film of all time. I grow up watching this movie. I saw it as a kid and I watch it on VHS tape 20 years ago. As a kid I loved this film to death it was my number 1 favorite Superman film and I still love it. Superman the Movie is my number 1 favorite Superman movie this is my number 2 Superman film. My idol in DC superheroes is Superman Christopher Reeve it always will be.I know this movie is criticized by everyone from fans trough actors. The producers Salkinds fired Richard Donner when the first Superman film was released in 1978 and become a hit. The Salkinds did not agree with Richard Donner's vision and they fired him. He was replaced by Richard Lester and Lester reshot most of the film. Only about 30 of Donner's work remained. This film is a completely step down form the first film Marlon Brando is missing and he is replaced lucky by Susannah York who played Lara in the first film. Gene Hackman Ned Beatty and Valerie Perrine are completely missing from this film. We know what happened to Otis he was caught in prison but what happened to Valerie Perrine as Ms. Teschmacher she disappeared trough whole film. The film is split in to two half's one focus on Clark Kent and Lois Lane love romance relationship the other was focusing on the three villains. The first half Superman agrees to sacrifice his powers to start a relationship with Lois Lane. I thought the love sequence between Superman and Lois worked fine in the movie. The second half three Kryptonian criminals he inadvertently released are conquering Earth. General Zod Ursa and Non. Those three Kryptonian kills people and they have less humor than the first three villains in the original film did. This movie has a dark tone but I still prefer this version over Richard Donner's version which I think it is highly overrated in my opinion. Christopher Reeve still did a good solid job playing Clark KentSuperman. Margot Kidder was much better than she was in the first film she was a hot lady. Richard Lester did a good job directing this film.I like the opening sequence in which Superman fly's in to Paris saves Lois in the elevator and throws the bomb away in to space. I like the attack on a white house from General Zod Ursa and Non that was epic in the film. I like Superman saving a kid in the Niagara Falls. I like in which Clark teaches a trucker a lesson on the end of the film I like the song too. John Williams music score is still great. Good acting performance from Christopher Reeve Margot Kidder Terence Stamp and Sarah Douglas those 4 of the cast are the reason too watch this movie. I like the battle in Metropolis in which Superman saves a young mommy and her baby turn's off the fire from a oil truck caused by Zod I love that. I love great shot of Superman returning the American flag to the White House saying to the President that he is sorry he had been away for a while  and that it won't happen again.I respect Sarah Douglas so much because was the only cast member to do extensive aroundtheworld press tours in support of the film and was one of the few actors who held a neutral point of view in the DonnerLester controversy. R.I.P.  Christopher Reeve 1952  2004 the only Clark KentSuperman who we always be my favorite superhero of all time! R.I.P.  Margot Kidder 1978  2018 it is sad that Lois Lane died by age 69. I have nothing but respect towards the actress. I really miss her. I love this film to death the best sequel of all time. Superman I and II are the best movies about Superman ever. The attack of the White House from three villains is still memorable for me. I love this movie to death.".

	schema:reviewBody "Superman II 1980 is so underrated by fans and critics of Richard Donner's cut who are the same people rooting for Zack Snyder's Man of Steel and Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice! Part II is another classic and excellent sequel from the 80's and the film from my childhood not as good as the first original film but still good. I am always going to cherish this movie. It is my personal Superman favorite sequel movie since my childhood. Christopher Reeve is the only Superman for me. I am defending this film from haters and people who put's down iconic superhero sequel who saves people. For some reason I didn't think it was as good as I remember and for my honest opinion it is still better than Richard Donner's cut or Zack Snyder movies! I grew up watching this film I was 6 years old when I saw Richard Lester's version on TV but I only saw half of the film. Superman III was the first film I saw on VHS as a child this was the third film I saw. I love this film to death I love this film the same as I love Superman I and III and it is my favorite sequel. Christopher Reeve is and always will be the only SUPERMAN! No one could play Clark KentSuperman like Christopher Reeve the film is still instantiate classic till it's day. If anyone could be Superman. It is Christopher Reeve he fits the part perfectly as the shy yet great reporter Clark Kent KalEl last son of Krypton and Superman Earths savior from the forces of evil. Superman is a world known icon and is permanently set in stone as the best Superhero of all time. Though the only Superman movies I enjoyed are the first three Superman movies that had Christopher Reeve in it! I hate the new Superman Henry Cavill he is not a Superman as I remember when I was a kid! We have now a Superman who kills people who let's people die and he only thinks on him self his mother Martha and Lois! I hate Superman IV The Quest for Peace Superman Returns Man of Steel Batman V Superman Dawn of Justice! Superman saves a lot of people in this film a kid who falls of Niagra fall's a young mommy and her baby turn's off the fire from a oil truck caused by Zod. I love Superman Christopher Reeve in this film and I was always fan of this film!John Williams theme is still a classic song to Superman my favorite iconic character!Things I don't like The film has a few problems that are really unnecessary and I really hate itEve Teschmacher Valerie Perrine disappears from the storyline after she and Lex Luthor Gene Hackman leave Superman's Fortress Of Solitude and her absence from the rest of the movie is never explained. Ned Beatty as Otis also disappears from the storyline why putting these two characters in this movie when they both had a cameo scene without explanation in it is beyond me even it was from Richard Donner cut they could have removed it anyway.Clark Kent revels his powers to Lois Margot Kidder that he is Superman and he sacrifice his powers for Lois that I stupid idea! After 1 hour Clark find's out that General Zod Terence Stamp and his goons conquering Earth behind his back and Superman wasn't there to stop theme I don't like this thing in this film at all. I don't like Ursa killing astronaut and kicking him in the groan. I hate Sarah Douglas Margot Kidder and Jack O'Halloran for dissing Christopher Reeve! The only two actors I have respect beside Christopher Reeve is Gene Hackman and Terence Stamp who was even in Smallville as the voice of JorEl Clark's biological father. Terence Stamp was perfect choice for playing General Zod he was brilliant and excellent as the main villain  respect to this actor! Overall I don't like Richard Donner's Cut the scene where Lois jumped into the Niagra Falls and Clark had to save her without revealing his identity... that was not in the film. It is a shame because I love that scene. Instead Lois shoots Clark to prove he is Superman. There are also a few more scenes cut out and replaced with other scenes. It is very interesting to see a different version of the film. But I have great memories of watching this film when I was a kid so I prefer the original version.R.I.P.  Christopher Reeve 1952  2004 the only Clark KentSuperman who we always be my favorite superhero of all time! This movie for my opinion is 1010 I don't care what anyone says about this movie or Richard Donner's cut that it is better in my opinion I enjoy this movie much way better.".

	schema:headline " Superman's only worthy sequel";
	schema:reviewBody "For those who are into the comic book movie craze today this one is one of the best comicy movies from the beginning of the summer blockbuster heyday. The original Superman is really an excellent film with solid honest direction by Richard Donner. Donner shot around half of this sequel and his scenes are all excellent Note Every Gene Hackman scene was shot by Donner  Hackman refused to return to production after Donner was fired.There is still much hope that Donner's footage will resurface. Most importantly of all there are vital scenes with Marlon Brando returning as Superman's father JorEl and giving his life to save his son and save the planet from the evil villains he vanquished from Krypton. It would also be interesting for audiences to see the difference between Donner's scenes and the ones reshot by Lester.The characters are great. Superman played by Christopher Reeve is in solid form and he and Lois are given the opportunity to enhance their relationship from the original story. Jackie Cooper is once again great as Perry White the chief editor of the Daily Planet.What makes this movie move is the villains. Gene Hackman is funnier and still up to no good and the villains from Krypton are menacing. His dialogue is truly witty and Hackman's timing is perfect. Terence Stamp is the power hungry General Zod out for revenge against the son of JorEl. Stamp plays it straight and his scenes directed by Donner show a true megalomaniac. Jack O'Halloran is solid as the hulking Non.Best of all is Sarah Douglas as the cold and evil Ursa in a truly underrated performance. She is the most curious and most interesting of the bunch. She collects badges as trophies for her conquering of earth wearing them to mock male hierarchy. Ursa seems to be a forerunner of all of the sexy female superwomen today but her role is not overstated and stale. She is not given gratuitous cleavage shots or anything of the sort. Ursa is a beautiful vamp and a tease and if anything we wish she would have more screen time. Sarah Douglas constantly gives us hints as to Ursa's wishes and we can only try to surmise what evil plans she is up to.The music is John Williams' score from the first film but used differently. Not sure if much of the music is original. Ken Thorne does a good job here of accenting cuts with Williams' original score Williams too refused to return after Donner was fired. Some great cues are Superman returning to fight the villains which is wonderfully heroic Ursa's shocking appearance to both the astronauts on the moon a violent scene that uses the darkest motifs from Krypton in the first film and the whole Metropolis battle in the end which is well supported by the music.The effects are very good for 1980. I keep reading how people are unhappy and always apologize for the FX in any movie more than a couple of years old. This one is solid and for the film it serves does well. The only major goof is when Superman delivers the American Flag at the end  The water fountain in front of the White House is clearly a model with frozen bursting water! The scene in the depowering chamber is not wellhandled either.Overall this is a very entertaining film and really amazingly considering it is obviously the work of two directors. Of all the comic book movies made from the 60s thru the 90s this one definitely rates in the top five along with the first Superman the first two Batmans. Supermans 3 and 4 were really poor. It is too bad that Christopher Reeve did not make more good Superman films. This one has some camp but it's way too entertaining and it's the only sequel to still have the flavor of the original. And please let's see a special edition DVD with all of the missing Richard Donner footage!!!!!".

Ursa seems to be a forerunner of all of the sexy female superwomen today but her role is not overstated and stale. She is not given gratuitous cleavage shots or anything of the sort. Ursa is a beautiful vamp and a tease and if anything we wish she would have more screen time. Sarah Douglas constantly gives us hints as to Ursa's wishes and we can only try to surmise what evil plans she is up to.The music is John Williams' score from the first film but used differently. Not sure if much of the music is original. Ken Thorne does a good job here of accenting cuts with Williams' original score Williams too refused to return after Donner was fired. Some great cues are Superman returning to fight the villains which is wonderfully heroic Ursa's shocking appearance to both the astronauts on the moon a violent scene that uses the darkest motifs from Krypton in the first film and the whole Metropolis battle in the end which is well supported by the music.The effects are very good for 1980. I keep reading how people are unhappy and always apologize for the FX in any movie more than a couple of years old. This one is solid and for the film it serves does well. The only major goof is when Superman delivers the American Flag at the end  The water fountain in front of the White House is clearly a model with frozen bursting water! The scene in the depowering chamber is not wellhandled either.Overall this is a very entertaining film and really amazingly considering it is obviously the work of two directors. Of all the comic book movies made from the 60s thru the 90s this one definitely rates in the top five along with the first Superman the first two Batmans. Supermans 3 and 4 were really poor. It is too bad that Christopher Reeve did not make more good Superman films. This one has some camp but it's way too entertaining and it's the only sequel to still have the flavor of the original. And please let's see a special edition DVD with all of the missing Richard Donner footage!!!!!";

The contrast is made even stronger by the fact that this time he must choose between a normal life and what he vowed to do with his abilities.Those looking for jawdropping action shouldn't worry either the scenes where Superman fights his three opponents with the same powers as he in the middle of Metropolis are still as awesome as they were 26 years ago a true joy for the eye.And as usual the acting is top notch Reeve gives Superman that special mix of strength and vulnerability that make him unique while the ruthless yet calculating Stamp and the hilarious Hackman form a perfect villain duo.So wanna see a superhero film with something special?

	schema:headline " The Adventure Continues...or so we thought!";
	schema:reviewBody "This film can be summed up in two words. Superman Trouble. That is the case. There are two versions of the film Superman II. One is the vision of acclaimed director Richard Donner full of color flourishes and camera work by the late Geoffrey Unsworth. The second is the vision put on director Richard Lester by choice of the film's producers Alexander and Ilya Salkind. Both the films contain the same story and characters but each was shot with a different tone different dialogue and footage which clash with intention. So in the end footage from each are woven into one movie which film buffs all over the world will notice is somewhat difficult to grasp. Due to the different directing styles of each director the final cut of Superman II ends up being a cliche work of special effects mismatched character analysis and central themes. The film deals with Superman and Lois falling in love and the three super villains from the prologue of the first film landing on earth and ultimately trying to take over. Very intense stuff. But this is where we as an audience need to know all the facts and here they are The first version of Superman II known as Superman II The Adventure Continues was directed by Richard Donner and supposed to be straight forward with serious tones and action packed sequences. This version was shot simultaneously with the original Superman in 197778. Originally to be released back to back with the original Superman II was filmed with vigorous explosions dangerous situations and tense irrefutable drama. In the opening a female liberation symbol Lois Lane tries to prove that Clark Kent is Superman by throwing herself out a window knowing that ClarkSuperman will fly out and save her. In another scene Superman gives up his powers and nearly kills himself only to get them back later on nearly killing himself again. This nailbittingly tense script brought back old characters and was to bring the original Superman to a full closure. All actors are fully concentrated and the print is a paragon. 80 of this film was finished when the producers fired director Donner due to some arguments that are still unknown to this day and replaced him with director Richard Lester and thusly Superman II The Adventure Continues was culminated. This is where the Richard Lester vision of the film comes into place. Simply titles Superman II the Richard Lester version is full of clumsy comedy amateur plotting and is nowhere near as affective as the Donner version. Lester is a comic director whom had worked on the previous Beatles films Help and Hard Days Night and had no experience directing any international blockbusters. To give him more credit than Richard Donner the producers rewrote most of the footage that Donner shot and went in with the actors for reshoots...even though Donner had already taken care of this! The villains are portrayed here as careless and comic whereas in Donner's version they were cold as steel and not to be messed with. In one reshot scene we see three villains who are Superman's foes land on earth and take interest in a snake. The snake bites the female villain and instead of showing her wrath on nature as was seen in Donner's moon scene which she kills an innocent astronaut in cold blood she sets the reptile on fire and giggles about it! Central themes of love and home were lost because of this as well. Because of budget problems and deadline the producers could not finish the reshoot and Superman II and had to fill the gaps with Donner footage from the vault making Superman II confusing and abstruce and that is what made Superman II an atavistic failure. 70 of the film is clumsy contrived comedy and useless violence while 30 of the film is straight forward full of munificent morals and such. The final cut has one scene showing the villains breaking into the white house and consequently taking over the world with sheer John Williams music the next scene you see them bored and incoherently complaining about being on a world where mankind doesn't even resist. The first film Superman had morals of justice and the American way while the second film was supposed to show morals of love and home and earthly pleasures that remind people of the good in the worldin a sense taking along with the truth justice and the American way. This message was lost between the footage by raconteur Donner and comic Lester. Nonetheless the film was a box office success and many critics including the late Pauline Kael and Roger Ebert praised the film for it's portrayal of good versus evil in the modern day society. Some of the footage shot by Donner that was not put into the final cut of the film has since been seen on network television showings and bootlegs but not all of it. The original opening which gave the film a better sense of dangerous excitement scenes involving KalEl and his father were scrappedDue to the Marlon Brando court case and the full original ending have all been locked away in London vaults and never before seen by anyone. So on the all in all level Superman II fails because it is nothing more than two films put together one a comedy one an action drama and this keeps Superman II' from being anything close to what the original has become.".

I'd rank it second only to the original Superman The Movie and only XMen is right up there.The thing about this movie that bugs me is that I grew up watching the ABC expanded version. That's the version my dad taped for me so for years I thought the expanded version was the only version. It wasn't until the mid80s when I saw SII on HBO that I realized what the theatrical cut was and how much of the expanded version added to the film.So if you ask me about Superman II expanded edition I'd definitely rank that as the best comic oriented film all time. Hopefully Warner Bros. will put together an interesting DVD on the film with all the supplemental footage including the neverbeforeseen Marlon Brando segment that was completely removed from the picture. The making of this film was a big time headache. All of Gene Hackman's scenes were filmed by Superman I director Richard Donner and then he was fired and Richard Lester was brought in. So it would be really cool and really insightful if a future DVD came out on the making of the film. But I digress.The theatrical version film while a bit aged is still tremendous fun. Christopher Reeve remains the embodiment of the Man of Steel and remains a case for one example of perfect casting. He makes the whole Clark KentSuperman thing plausible by making Kent an insecure bumbling reporter. Terrence Stamp is also wonderfully cast as archvillain General Zod.The climax in Times Square is still exciting and funny. And the whole relationship between Lois and ClarkSuperman is brought to the forefront.I'd definitely put this film as a supreme candidate for the full DVD red carpet treatment complete because the current DVD lacks big time.".

It gets down to business immediately with supervillains coming to Earth and builds to unbearably tense climax in Metropolis. Some of the scenes are absolute classics the  three villains descending silently through space towards Earth is chillingly ominous the bad guys storming the White House and confrounting the President himself the brilliant doublebluff ending which will have you pleading Oh No!! and then cheering Oh Yes!! the bit when it looks like it's all over and then newspapers in the street get blown about the farmiliar theme strikes up and we know who's back and the best scene of all with a beaten up Clark watching the President on TV. Incredible stuff. Forget the million bullets finale of FaceOff the climactic confrontation in the night time streets of Metropolis is surely the most spectacular showdown in film history with Superman and the bad guys in a incredible battle of the titans. The action is truly astonishing  they punch each other through ENTIRE skyscrapers and throw BUSES at each other! Almost everything in their way gets demolished  cars fly through the air and smash into each other people get blown down the street it's an amazing almost orgasmically destructive scene. This film is far better than any of the other films in the series and easily better than the legion of multimillion dollar blockbusters laden with CGI and nonexistent characters. The only thing wrong with it is the poor version of the incredible theme tune and the Clark and Lois bits are a dull. Apart from that an absolute classic and so damn exciting.".

	schema:reviewBody "This Superman movie has got to be the bench mark for future producers of Superman movies. They must be sat down with this film because it is an absolute classic and as far as Superman films go it will be hard to top. Richard Lester is not very popular with some Superman fans because he took over on a movie that they feel would have been better had Richard Donner been allowed to complete. But Lester has his admirers and iam one of them. The first Superman movie tended to go along with boring philosophising or over sentimental dramatics these are mainly absent in Superman II. They are replaced with cut to the action dramatics by Richard Lester who in my opinion saved the movie or at least made it all the more exciting. I enjoy his sense of comic book adventure and the final Times Square battle between Superman vs ZodNon and Ursa is straight out of a comic book and is all Lesters. The main thing that complements the movie is the towering performance by Christopher Reeve as Clark KentSuperman. Reeve is hillarious in his Cary Grantalike interpretation of Kent and wonderfull as a humanistic Superman. Margot Kidder is fabulous to and it is the acting of theese two that makes the SupermanLois love triangle work. Terance Stamp as Zod is very creepy and Sarah Douglas as Ursa very sexy but the man who very nearly steels the show is Gene Hackman hilarious as Lex Luther. The special effects are brilliant because they look glossy and the Ken Thorne variation of John Williams Superman theme is at its best here. The best aspects though is the action the aforementioned Times Square battle and the interaction between the actors. Well done Richard Lester. A True classic of Superhero cinema.".

As much as I loved the original movie I loved Superman II even more. I still remember that hot June day in 1981 when I saw a double feature of two brand new movies Raiders of the Lost Ark and Superman II. That was the best movie day of my young life.Superman II picks up exactly where part one left off. It kicks into maximum overdrive in the opening scenes and never lets up. The film is full of awesome action great humor great villains and a sense of fun that so many modern superhero movies are missing. I absolutely love The Dark Knight Marvel's The Avengers Iron Man the XMen movies etc. but they lack the fun factor and the heart of Superman II.Christopher Reeve WAS Superman. He proved that after his tragic accident. He kept fighting to the end and never gave up the battle. I truly admired that man. On screen no one will ever top him. Cavill is very good Routh was okay but Reeve WAS Superman.Gene Hackman was terrific as Lex Luthor and Margot Kidder was absolutely believable as Lois Lane. Terence Stamp was amazing as the evil Zod. This movie along with Superman The Movie Star Trek The Motion Picture and Alien was a constant on my parents' VCR in the early '80s. I'm sure I drove them bonkers by playing it over and over again. I have since seen the Richard Donner cut and I loved that alternate version as well. I prefer the theatrical release because the Lester version seems to be a more complete film. I have seen Superman II hundreds of times and it always makes me feel good. It will remain one of my favorite films for the rest of my life.".

Such innocent almost niave filmmaking it personifies the term family entertainment and is simply great fun to watch.Other superheroes have floundered at the box office and maybe this is to do with lack of affinity between the makers and the source material. Certainly the Superman films are tongueincheek but never so that they're disrespectful to their content or their audience. The Crow was a good example of the graphic novel set and the Batman series did well under the underrated Michael Keaton but floundered under the flat Val Kilmer and increasingly childish setpieces. The less said about Batman and Robin the better.Of course Superman had his own Batman and Robin in the guise of Superman VI The Quest For Peace a movie made four years after the third and with seemingly a fraction of the budget. But Superman II was the series at its' peak. The theme music a startling Star Wars soundalike by John Williams fades to edited recaps of the previous film. These involve Superman as a baby being sent from the destruction of his home planet and are cleverly spliced together so as to avoid having to pay Marlon Brando any more royalties. Yet we do see Brando's hand. Surely that's worth half a million?. 20 of this movie was shot alongside the 1978 vehicle and so we get reminded in this sequence of the three Kryptonian villains about to be accidentally released by Superman in a hbomb explosion.This was still in the days when films were properly constructed to allow for a genuine buildup a fullyformed middle and a proper end. Even minor players such as Perry White Jackie Cooper have great lines and characterisation thrusted upon them. This may be just a fun movie but it is lovingly put together not thrown together as many films are. All the actors are wonderful Christopher Reeve is just right as Superman Margot Kidder is the definitive Lois Lane despite almost drowning in soft focus for her closeups and Gene Hackman is of course absolutely hilarious as Lex Luthor. But my favourite player in this sequel is Terence Camp as General Zod. Terence plays Zod exactly the same as he plays Bernadette in The Adventures of Priscilla Queen of the Desert and makes great work of the lead villain that must be in Hollywood circles always English. Why do you say these things when you know I will kill you for it? he minces to Hackman with great effect.Of course now twenty years old this film is less You'll believe a man can fly than You'll believe a man can swing on wires in front of an unconvincing backdrop but this is still wonderful entertainment. Maybe the middle section with Clark getting cut to ribbons after being thrown through a plate glass window is a little violent as is the confrontation between Superman and the trio of villains. There's also the nagging feeling that this section is the biggest single example of product placement ever seen on film. Or is it coincidence that a Superman who featured in a comicbook antismoking campaign against Nick O'Teen no less is continually thrown into a Malboro van? Even Zod gets to know things look better with CocaCola as he is unceremoniously hurled into a neon sign for the corporation.But these are minor gripes and how anyone can hold them against such a harmless film is beyond me. Superman II isn't Citizen Kane by any means but I defy you to sit through this movie and not love it.".

This was where the cast and crew were supposed to pick up filming of Superman II in early February of 1979. However a new order was called in by producer Ilya Salkind. A new director to be exact and that was the dellima of Superman II. In 197778 Richard Donner shot a near estimate of 80  of Superman II simultaneously with Superman but that is not the point. The point is that his version was a much more subtle version which followed the characters emotions from the blockbuster first film and had an exciting plot of Lois and Superman falling in love villains killing earth beings and Superman almost having to risk it all for the world...or the woman he loves! But when director Richard Lester came in to do reshoots and shoot all new scenes he had a different vision in mind. His version was simple. Make the villains look like dumb butts while Lois and Superman enjoy an unequal relationship where Lois is given the back seat treatment to mediocre looks and a Superman that would rather make the metropolis people laugh than save the world! As that is what so wrongly happens we shall go over the facts. Superman and Lois are supposed to have the kind of love that EVERY American dreams of having. Donner insured this in never seen love scenes which would have garnered the film an Rrating. Lester's love scenes are cheap and tacky with hilarious dialogue and no wit to back it up. The villains scenes in the Donner version are cruel ruthless and downright evil. In Lester's scenes the villains pronounce names wrong look at eachother in stupidity and act like imbeciles. The film had a good premise going for it Superman has just saved the world from nuclear destruction and then the villains arrive and start destruction. Meanwhile Lois and Superman fall in love. That was still the plot but the myth and mystique which made the original film such a classic are nowhere to be seen here. Instead we get NASA jerks talking about a curl in space! Lester was really trashing the mythology with this peice of junk. America had thought that the second Superman film would be a film that they would remember. No such luck as one would have guessed. The film is basically two unfinished films sloppily put together in this turkey! Superman II is NOT without interest. In fact alot of the scenes are fun to watch because of the action sequences. But it is true what others say that it seems like Lester was trying at a BeatlesSuperman film. Clumsy comedy and stupid chaos ensues as the villains blow through metropolis. Another thing that gets on this writer's nerves is when the townspeople are rooting for Superman in the battle sequence! This villains are trying to kill these people and what do they do? They don't run in fear as they should but root for Superman when he beats the villains up calling out rediculous dialogue such as C'mon! Get 'em Superman! as if they are present at a high school football match! Too much stupid writing and directing. I will always have respect for Superman II because the whole Superman series has been a part of my better memories in life for a long time. We have yet to see if the true version of Superman will ever be released on DVD in the form of the Richard Donner cut as so many fans like to call it. IT is really Ilya Salkinds cut as he has the contract to the rights of ALL the filmsincluding Supergirl and their footage. All in all Superman II fails on a lot of top levels but has the interest for lower levels. Only if Richard Donner's version gets released will we as an audience and appreciative film viewers get the true experience of Superman II The Adventure Continues!".

	schema:reviewBody "I just couldn't wait for the director's cut so anything I say here might soon be outdated.Superman II directed in 1980 by Richard Lester is probably the best sequel of the first wave of superhero movies. Superman II is big goofy fun with a sense of action romance and humor that wouldn't quite be seen again in the genre until last year's Fantastic Four. Superman II is one of the great sequels despite its sloppy editing and a controversial backstory worthy of a movie of its own.We know that Superman 1978 director Richard Donner was originally supposed to direct the sequel but was fired under highly suspicious and to this day unknown circumstances following a dispute with that film's producers the Salkinds. Supposedly it began with issues over creative direction. Compounding that Donner had gone over the originally planned budget for Superman and the Salkinds had been rushing the poor man to complete the film.

Only about 25 of the original scenes Donner filmed are in the movie we know today with jarring transitions between scenes since nearly three years had passed between the two directors' filming of scenes.

What we get to paraphrase another viewer is sloppy seconds but still an enjoyable and moving experience in its right. Superman II still made a box office killing in 1981 so it couldn't have been that bad ?. Hopefully this will all be cured by the new Richard Donner cut that's due out on Nov. 28 later this year which should include more of Donner's original material more Hackman footage Marlon Brando more violence and story dealing with the three Krypton villains' task on Earth more scenes with Reeve and Kidder completed special effects a new opening and ending  ? and Lester footage to fill in the gaps.In Superman II the Man of Steel as Clark Kent Reeve is getting serious with Lois Lane Kidder and considers giving up being Superman.

The blast frees the traitorous head of Krypton's military forces General Zod Stamp the manhating Ursa Sarah Douglas and the brutish Non Jack O'Halloran who then make a beeline for Earth in a bid for world domination. Once on Earth they discover they have all of Superman's powers and then some. Meanwhile Lex Luthor Hackman manages to escape from prison with help from Miss Teschmacher played by Valerie Perrine leaving a hapless Otis Ned Beatty behind and sets out on a quest to the North Pole to find the Fortress of Solitude using a device he constructed while incarcerated.What this all climaxes in is an actionpacked if not somewhat slapstick special effects bonanza that takes place in the skies over Metropolis with Superman and the three Krypton villains going head to head. It's really exciting stuff to see Superman grappling with the new experience of fighting three adversaries of his power level.Is Superman II a failure? Yes because it betrays what was originally laid out by a great director and is probably one of the great early examples of Hollywood chopping  screwing. Superman II is still highly regarded as a cult classic and director Sam Raimi makes a few nods with SpiderMan 2 2004. I can see that DC Comics is making a comeback if original Superman cocreators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster could see these films I bet they'd be proud.P.S. R.I.P.  Marlon Brando1010".

	onyx:emotionText "I just couldn't wait for the director's cut so anything I say here might soon be outdated.Superman II directed in 1980 by Richard Lester is probably the best sequel of the first wave of superhero movies. Superman II is big goofy fun with a sense of action romance and humor that wouldn't quite be seen again in the genre until last year's Fantastic Four. Superman II is one of the great sequels despite its sloppy editing and a controversial backstory worthy of a movie of its own.We know that Superman 1978 director Richard Donner was originally supposed to direct the sequel but was fired under highly suspicious and to this day unknown circumstances following a dispute with that film's producers the Salkinds. Supposedly it began with issues over creative direction. Compounding that Donner had gone over the originally planned budget for Superman and the Salkinds had been rushing the poor man to complete the film. Conversely Marlon Brando JorEl in Superman didn't want to be in the second movie and filed suit over his percentage of that film's earnings.

Not as episodic as the first one II is more consistently plot driven. Reeve and Kidder are again SUPERB in their iconic roles. The scene where Lois finds out Supe's real identity is still one of my favourite cinematic denouements. The supporting cast with Terence Stamp Zod Sarah Douglas Ursa and Gene Hackman Luthor as standouts plays it real. The only downside with the acting for me is Jack O'Halloran's Non who is played too much for laughs.The special effects are even better than in the first Superman. While certainly not up to the standards of today's technology they still hold up well. Remember these effects are a quarter of a century old! Special mention goes out to the fantastic and devastating battle royale of super powers between Superman and the Phantom Zone fugitives. Also satisfying is Clark Kent's revenge on a mortal bully at the finale.".

The only thing in the movie that Richard Lester really deserves any credit for is directing the 12 minute fight in Metropolis between Superman General Zod Non and Ursa. That scene is still fun to watch even with today's overblown CGI.Well 2 is the love story entry in the series as Lois Lane discovers that Superman and Clark Kent are the same guy and she lets him know about her infatuation with him. They go steady in his Fortress of Solitude he gives up his powers so he can live a normal life with her which the comic book Superman WOULD NEVER DO then he has to get them restored after he finds out that the villains General Zod Ursa and Non are raising hell and taking over the planet. Lex Luther is also back for the 2nd go around.People keep complaining that the film doesn't explain how Superman got his powers restored. Well I have an old copy of an ABC Sunday night showing of Superman II and mind you I still haven't bought the DVD the TV showing implied that Superman used the green crystal  the same one that started off his awakening in the first movie and built the Fortress of Solitude  to restore his powers. And according to an interview I read with Richard Donner the whole idea was that Superman restored his powers by draining all the crystals in his Fortress of Solitude and lost the ability to contact the ghosts of his parents in the process. Another plot hole I can't get over is how Superman ever fell for the Margot Kidder version of Lois Lane  she's an illiterate chain smoking scatter brain! Gene Hackman still gives the worst performance of his career as Lex Luther but hey it's Gene!Legend has it that Hackman refused to do Superman III because he was outraged over the way the Salkinds had treated Richard Donner.Christopher Reeve is still a good Superman though and here he actually has a real threat in the form of cold blooded Terence Stamp as General Zod who is helped by Jack O'Halloran's mute hulk Non and Sarah Douglas's misanthropic Ursa she later played the evil queen in Conan the Destroyer. And as mentioned above the fight between Superman and Zod's trio is a knock out. Don't miss Christopher ReeveSuperman throwing Terence StampZod into the giant neon Coke sign!".

	schema:reviewBody "While 1978's Superman launched the superhero movies genre and proved that good movies could be made out of to be blunt childish comic book characters it was it's sequel that set the standard for just how great superhero movies could be. Sam Raimi's wonderful first two SpiderMan films in particular his second one a masterpiece can both be traced back to this as it focuses on the man behind the blue costume. The film focuses on Superman ultimately being forced to reveal his secret identity to love interest Lois Lane after a series of clues causes her to catch on. As they fall deeper in love he ultimately decides he wants to be with her and gives up all of his powers to do although after an ugly encounter with a man named Rocky at a cafe that makes him uncomfortable with how vulnerable he now is and the arrival of escaped Kryptonion criminal the ruthless General Zod who conquers Earth with the help of his equally dangerous associates Ursa and Non he is forced reconsider. The plot ultimately resolves itself after Zod's defeat with Lois becoming depressed at the thought of never being able to be with him or or move on from him so Clark does the noble thing of wiping her memory of his true identity to spare her the pain. This aspect is very well written and one of the few romance story lines in the superhero genre they've managed to get right.Acting wise I can't even express how good Reeve is as ClarkSuperman. He absolutely nails Clark's awkward facade to a tee and strikes the perfect line between corny and badass as Superman. I'm still not sure how he manages to pull off this character so well. It's uncanny. Kidder also impresses as Lois being given a much wider range of scenes and emotions in this and thus more to do. Gene Hackman also returns as chief antagonist Lex Luthor in a supporting role and even he is much better in this than the previous one finally free of his annoying associates and awful dialogue that dragged his character down in the first movie. It's Terrance Stamp who owns the entire thing though with his scene stealing performance as the diabolical General Zod completely nailing every line facial expression and movement for his character. He's so good that he managed to turn a forgettable character from the comics into a cultural icon.This movie had a troubled production with director Richard Donner being replaced after completing half of the movie due to conflicts with the producers with credited director Richard Lester finishing the product. Donner's full vision for the film would be released as The Richard Donner cut in 2006 and is also brilliant but the theatrical version remains just as good and just as well made despite the behindthescenes nightmare. In fact Lester's more comedic version seems to work well here blending in with the drama seamlessly with the exception of the terrible slapstick used during the Metropolis battle scene to to create a highly enjoyable film filled with romance humour action and drama and ultimately the best Superman movie of then all. Just a shame Lester then ruined it all with the...Uh....next installment.".

	onyx:emotionText "While 1978's Superman launched the superhero movies genre and proved that good movies could be made out of to be blunt childish comic book characters it was it's sequel that set the standard for just how great superhero movies could be. Sam Raimi's wonderful first two SpiderMan films in particular his second one a masterpiece can both be traced back to this as it focuses on the man behind the blue costume. The film focuses on Superman ultimately being forced to reveal his secret identity to love interest Lois Lane after a series of clues causes her to catch on. As they fall deeper in love he ultimately decides he wants to be with her and gives up all of his powers to do although after an ugly encounter with a man named Rocky at a cafe that makes him uncomfortable with how vulnerable he now is and the arrival of escaped Kryptonion criminal the ruthless General Zod who conquers Earth with the help of his equally dangerous associates Ursa and Non he is forced reconsider. The plot ultimately resolves itself after Zod's defeat with Lois becoming depressed at the thought of never being able to be with him or or move on from him so Clark does the noble thing of wiping her memory of his true identity to spare her the pain.

	schema:reviewBody "When Superman 1978 arrived in theaters Christopher Reeve had become one of the biggest names around. With his portrayal of the iconic American hero and all around good guy Clark Kent  Superman Reeve had solidified that he was in fact the original Superman even though there were portrayals before him. Two years later fans received a delightful second entry in the life of the man of steel. For this particular installment there are a number of additions to the original story that was told in 1978. Much of it greatly increases the depth of the main leads but there are also a couple of errors that weren't addressed.Viewers begin the story with the reintroduction of General Zod Terence Stamp and his cronies being banished to the phantom zone. Then skip ahead to current time where Superman is doing his usual business of saving people and accidentally releases Zod and his buddies from the phantom zone. However Kent doesn't know this. Instead as the Zod crew begin wreaking havoc on Earth Kent is too busy being caught up on Lois Lane Margot Kidder. Among all this though Kent as an individual goes through quite a character arc thanks to the three writers behind the screenplay. One of which worked on two of the Godfather films and the other wrote for Bonnie and Clyde 1967.The best subplot to the writing is the relationship between Clark Kent and Lois Lane. Over time Lois begins realizing the patterns at which Superman appears making her suspicious of coworker Clark. This happens gradually and finally when it hits it's very sudden. Perhaps too quickly but by that point viewers will be too invested into what is going on that it won't matter. This is a pivotal point because it tests Clark to see how well he can be as himself. Unfortunately with this rich character development comes flimsy loophole endings that are not expanded upon. There are certain things in movies that shouldn't go assumed. Not every audience member may understand which would have them looking other places for answers. If something is going to be done for a reason there should be an explanation behind it. Other than this particular issue there really isn't much to see that's wrong. Even though the director had changed due to friction the playout feels very much like the last film. The tone did not change and neither did the characters. Christopher Reeve Margot Kidder Jackie Cooper Gene Hackman all play their roles like they had never left the set. Terence Stamp as Zod and his followers also give likable performances even for villains. What Stamp does that makes Zod so interesting is how he speaks it sounds so pompous. Zod's henchman are cool too. Ursa being quite a powerful woman and Non just for being brute muscle every time and any time he's on screen.The practical effects are consistent and continue to be effective. Along with that are the action sequences that increase in damage and uniqueness. Surprisingly even the style of cinematography was changed. Robert Paynter took over. Although it was executed differently the shots and overall image still look grand and beautiful. Perhaps the most astonishing is that John Williams did not return to compose. Yet Ken Thorne who just past away this year the replacement composer did a respectable job filling in. Thorne maintained the Superman theme and continued the upbeat feel of the tracks. Well done.The development in its characters is done exceptionally. Sadly the buildup is so good that its justification for various actions feel flimsy like that of its predecessor's finale. Other than that it is worthy of a superman sequel from its production design music special effects and cast.".

	schema:headline " Superman II is such a fun action adventure movie!";
	schema:reviewBody "I can't praise enough how much I love this movie. I wasn't a huge fan of the 1978 Superman movie. So this review I will have to compare these two films.'Superman II' focuses once more around Clark Kent whose love affair with Louis Lane isn't going too well until she eventually finds out that Clark is Superman and is willing to marry him. In order to marry a mortal Clark must give up his power and become a mortal. All the while Clark is unaware that three Kryptonian criminals that were locked up by JorEl have escaped following an event at the very beginning of the play and plan to make chaos across Earth whilst finding JorEl's son Ka'El Superman! The acting in this movie is better than it was in the original. Christopher Reve was fantastic in the movie and provided some truly hilarious moments. His constant transition between a socially awkward newspaper reporter and the Man of Steel was hilarious and truly drove the film along. The woman playing Lois I thought did a better job in this one than the first. Terence Stamp was great as Zod.The way Superman II starts with Clark realizing that some terrorists have taken over Paris and are planning to blow up is priceless where he quotes That's terrible! only for his boss to casually reply That's why they're called terrorists. From that moment on I was glued to my seat.Everything to me is superior here than in the original except one thing. The acting was better the visuals had slightly improved the story was far better the villain was better and the action sequences here actually were quite entertaining despite being made in 1980. I loved how this movie managed to bring villains from KaEl's home planet instead of having some criminal mastermind who barely did anything that truly excited or truly gave any suspense. In the first film Lex Luthor is so lightly focused on and when his plans really come they are so rushed. Here the three criminals are given plenty more screen time and are funny they are dangerous and more like superhero villains.There is so much that happens in this movie over 2 hours that when it was over I was disappointed that it wasn't a little longer. Everything in this film was entertaining and more importantly done well from Lois trying to expose Clark's truly identity to the criminals taking over Houston to Clark giving up his power for Lois. There was so much good in this movie. The action was good much better than any in Superman 1978. The only thing I truly found better in the original was how they did Superman's origin story and how he came to Earth....That and of course the ever so legendary Marlon Brando's performance of JorEl.At the time of its release it was the greatest superhero movie and until Nolan's Batman trilogy came I think that it truly deserves to be the greatest superhero film. 'Superman II' is truly adventurous hilarious exciting and engaging.".

	schema:reviewBody "As far as sequels go Superman II is very good. Some people say it is even better than the original. I don't know if I would go so far as to say that but it is definitely slaphappier. It features the three Kryptonian villains who had been convicted of evildoing in the beginning of the first installment and imprisoned in the Phantom Zone which is interpreted in this translation as a mirrorlike trapezoid that indefinitely hurls itself through space. Apparently though there were some design flaws. For one thing prisoners do not age while doing time in the Phantom Zone. And the engineers obviously did not anticipate that after floating around for thirtyfive years or so the portal would pass by the Earth. And they further did not anticipate that Superman would hurl an elevator rigged with a hydrogen bomb into space at precisely the right moment shattering the portal. The ensuing storyline reflects a perfect combination of Reagan era and Freudian sensibilities. It's all about the deleterious effects of domineering women on traditional masculinity. For instance the evil Ursa has no respect for established successful virile men. She destroys soldiers cops and astronauts and then rips off their badges and medals a metaphor for penis envyshe steals their status symbols which stand in for their respective manhoods. Also Lois and Superman hook up. But it renders him completely useless because he is forced to forfeit all his powers in order to put up with her unyielding genderrebellion. Lois is a successful professional with no intention of settling into feminine domesticity. And she's not the softest looking woman ever to grace the silver screen either. Superman can't embody the traditional male role without a traditional wife. So by being in love with her he is emasculated. Literally. I especially enjoy the scene when he gets beat up by a redneck in a roadside diner and Lois joins the brawl in a humiliating attempt to rescue him. And in addition to its gender politics it is hilarious when remembering all that grief his Kryptonian mother expressed in the original Superman about sending her son off to a strange world where he would always feel like an alien outsider. If they could rob him of his socially ostracizing super powers why didn't they do it to begin with? Why take them away from him in adulthood after his identity is fully formed and he is fully dependent on them? Silly Kryptonians. Anyway the movie is quite a lot of fun. It straddles a fine line between being a graceful interpretation of an unprecedented comic icon like the first Superman film and being a Theater of the Absurdlike interpretation as captured by Superman III. Not to be confused with the Theater of the Inane interpretation which is so masterfully executed in Superman IV.".

	schema:headline " 'It's Still the Word'";
	schema:reviewBody "Sandy and Danny their names alone mean nothing together they represent the film we all know and love that brought us 'Summer Nights' and 'Greased Lightnin'. Grease is an infamous musicalplay turned film adapted and produced by Allan Carr chartering the summertastic rock 'n' roll of the 1950s centring on the highs and lows of a group of teenagers at highschool Rydell High.The film begins with two people having a summer romance Sandy NewtonJohn an uptight nave nerdy Australian girl and Danny Travolta a 'jackthelad' 'T' bird. After the opening credits which are amusing cartoons of the main characters we see the two well known groups of teenagers the Pink Ladies and the 'T' Birds going back to school after summer vacation. The rest of the film centres mostly on the relationship of Sandy and Danny the problems they face and the ups and downs of their high school chums. The main characters and the unusual pairing of Sandy and Danny makes for comfortable viewing.My favourite part of the film is the music this film has such a brilliant soundtrack. If you have the chance to watch the film on DVD you get the added bonus of a songbook. However with a musical film you do find some parts unrealistic when they sing why would a group of lads sing Summer Nights for example? Yet that aside the songs mostly corny love songs are addictive and easy to pick up unfortunately will be in your head all day. Grease may not have had a lavish budget like films made today but this 1978 film directed by Randal Kleiser still manages to have great audience appeal. Its' scenes and costumes are basic and probably didn't break the bank to produce but this all adds to the realism of the film.I like the film and could watch it over and over again. NewtonJohn's debut performance is excellent but her character Sandy is too 2D and has no depth. Travolta's performance is to perfection and this film benchmarked his film career. Danny is 3D he can be loving self obsessed a saviour and a winner whereas Sandy to me is just a bore. All characters bring something different to the film making it a success. Rizzo is the hard nosed cow bitchy about Sandy possibly jealous who seeks revenge on her boyfriend by going out with his arch enemy. There is also Marcy who loves the men and has lots of boyfriends and Frenchy who becomes Sandy's best friend who is caring.This uplifting audience grabbing film may be slightly cheesy but there is just so much to love about it especially the soundtrack and dance moves! This gives it longevity making it such a great film that could be the best musical ever made. This classic film deserves a 55 just for being groovy! But I just can't stop thinking why is it called Grease?!".

	schema:reviewBody "Grease definitely has a fun energy to it and all of the cast has great chemistry. That's the main reason that this film despite being nearly 30 years old and set 20 years earlier than that still manages to appeal to young people of today who laugh and have fun with it and of course sing those timeless songs. So hats off to Grease for that.Now that being said the movie is incredibly stupid! It's basically a 90 minute episode of Happy Days or Saved By the Bell in which we follow various plot lines in a high school strung together by the fun songs. We're treated to such stupid dialog as This year I don't take no crap from nobody. Yes ma'am. No ma'am. Hey it's Eugene! In one plot line Frenchy who's a memorable character but dumber than a bag of nails becomes a beauty school drop out. However aside from being an excuse for Frankie Avalon to sing that song the plot line goes nowhere and she still magically graduates high school along side everyone else. Who knew it was so easy to drop out and get back in? But then there's the main plot line two youths named Danny and Sandy fall in love one summer which is just fine in the real world but once back in high school they realize they're in different social cliques he's a greaser and she's a goodygoody. Throughout the school year their relationship takes several turns before arriving at an absurd ending in which all problems are magically solved by Sandy getting a makeover and becoming cool. The message here is so superficial that it's actually funny Give in to peer pressure and be whatever kind of person you need to be to make your boyfriend or girlfriend happy. Considering Sandy has been celibate through all of the movie till now I think it's implied Danny will get a nice surprise that night a message to give to young girls ha ha.So to wrap up this little review Grease certainly has its moments and IS a wellmade movie musical or else it wouldn't have the audience it does. It's a feelgood movie it just has zero substance.".

John Travolta was great and everyone else especially Stockard Channing were all fabulous. Oh and if you ever go to a Karaoke night make sure you do the Grease Megamix sometime throughout the night as it'll get the crowd pumped guaranteed.Final SynopsisMovies  I did see this when I was in high school because it was rereleased in the late 90's in theaters but stupid macho me back then didn't care for it. This is one you can view easily on the silver screen and enjoy it just as much for a lot cheaper.DVD Purchase  Couldn't resist for only 9.Rental  This could easily be a once a year habit.".

	schema:reviewBody "Grease is the word. There are many musicals in the world but not one compare to the musical that is Grease. You have the Tbirds and the Pink Ladies and new incomer Sandy Olsson who overall take the story through twists and turns. Good girl Sandy and Greaser Danny must make lifechanging decisions on whether being who they are now is worth loosing the one they most care about.Like most musicals Grease tells their audience the story through song engaging the audience. With the song Summer Nights we are introduced into the background information on how exactly Sandy and Danny met during the summer. With the two stories not adding up we get a feel on the personalities of bad boy Danny and sweet and innocent Sandy. After running into each other at a pep rally for the football team Sandy runs off crying after being humiliated by the bad boy Danny in front of his fellow Tbirds and Pink Ladies. Throughout the story we see the numerous attempts by both Danny and Sandy to show one another whether it be changing from a leather jacket to a letterman jacket or dating a jock in attempts to make him jealous. Through Hopelessly Devoted to You and  Sandy the couple show that no matter what they are going through now they cant and wont stop loving each other. While the Danny and Sandy are trying to make things work Danny's second in command Kenickie is out to beat Tbirds rival gang The Scorpions in a race were they will be racing for ownership papers of the cars or what they call Pinks. Though a series of unfortunate events and Kenickie is incapable of racing he asks his friend Danny to take his place. After winning the race and defeating their rivals we see that Sandy has been watching the race from afar. Asking Pink Ladies' Frenchy for a makeover we see that not only did Danny make the transition from leather jacket to letterman but also Sandy went from innocent to Pink Lady newcomer. In the final scene Rydell High School has rewarded the graduating class with a senior carnival. Here we get the first look at new and improved Danny Zuko who has indeed traded in his Tbird jacket but he isn't the only one who made a drastic change. After reassuring his fellow boys that this change in jackets didn't mean the end to their friendship Danny is soon interrupted by the new Sandy Olsson. You're The One That I Want is the final song number the couple sing showing that they both changed their ways to be with each other and in the end it worked out for the best. The final number the Tbirds and the Pink Ladies perform is the song  We Go Together. This number gives the audience the final feel for the movie and the two groups of friends as they part ways. Yes the movie isn't the most relevant and up to date movie but it still has what it takes to be a classic. With the love story that Grease takes us on we take a trip when not just the girl has to change for the guy but also the guy goes through endless activities to be with his one true love. This movie is one you can't get tired of. The more you watch the more the songs stick with you and with the songs it just adds in to the affect that comes with watching Grease. Grease really and truly is the word. And it's a movie that is worthy enough to be considered a classic.".

You're The One That I Want is the final song number the couple sing showing that they both changed their ways to be with each other and in the end it worked out for the best. The final number the Tbirds and the Pink Ladies perform is the song  We Go Together. This number gives the audience the final feel for the movie and the two groups of friends as they part ways. Yes the movie isn't the most relevant and up to date movie but it still has what it takes to be a classic. With the love story that Grease takes us on we take a trip when not just the girl has to change for the guy but also the guy goes through endless activities to be with his one true love. This movie is one you can't get tired of. The more you watch the more the songs stick with you and with the songs it just adds in to the affect that comes with watching Grease. Grease really and truly is the word. And it's a movie that is worthy enough to be considered a classic.";

	schema:reviewBody "Very possibly the most known musical of all time Grease is a film that just blew up and knocked everyone out of the ball park with it's catchy tunes sexy actors and just gave everyone a great time. I've watched this movie since I was a kid I find it hard to believe that there isn't a person who doesn't at least know one song from this musical even if they hadn't seen it. But I just adored it played it over and over again because of the songs. I thought the pink ladies were so cool and the TBirds were so funny. Growing up and watching it again it does have a different view than that of a child but I think it holds up well and is still a ton of fun.Danny a greaser is a member of the TBirds who include Kenickie Doody Putzie and Sonny. Meanwhile the Pink Ladies arrive Rizzo Frenchie Jan and Marty. After her parents decided not to return to Australia Sandy enrolls at Rydell and befriends Frenchy who considers dropping out of school to become a beautician. Oblivious to each other's presence at school Danny and Sandy tell the TBirds and Pink Ladies their respective accounts of events during their brief romance. Learning Danny is Sandy's lover Rizzo arranges for the two to reunite but Danny is forced to maintain his bad boy attitude in front of his friends upsetting Sandy. Now with their love on the rocks these groups need to drop the attitude and just sing their problems away because grease is the word.One of the most talked about scenario's is that Sandy supposedly has to change herself in order to be with Danny enraging a lot of feminists. My look at it is that these two did genuinely love each other while they shouldn't have cared so much about what their friends thought they would be willing to do anything for each other in order to be a couple. You even see Danny dressed a little bit more preppy before he sees Sandy in her new transformation.I love the energy that is put into this film I think that's what makes it so special. Everyone just loves to dance and sing to this movie. How could you resist it? My favorite scene that still gives me chills and gets me up dancing is definitely the school dance scene. Between the dancing the music then to add the jokes that were made on top of that with Kenickie lifting up the cheerleader's dress to just have fun since she's such a goodiegoodie was just too funny. My only complaint being about this movie that I still don't get is that Danny starts dancing with Cha Cha when she pulls him away from Sandy he just keeps going not even thinking about Sandy. One of the things I find so hilarious about this movie also is that the actors who all look like they're in their 30's are playing 17 year old's. But I digress this movie still holds up today because it just brings a certain happiness to people. It's a wonderful film that anyone could find themselves dancing or singing too.810".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of a number of movies I saw back when they were first released misguidedly enjoyed at the time and now find I have major issues with. I suppose it's a mildly entertaining movie of generally brainless drivel 50's greaser stereotype rebellion with a few catchy tunes. If it was merely that okay but this film gives its viewers especially teenage ones ALL the worst possible messages.The plot revolves around young love ? as experienced by the pretty innocent young Australian girl Sandy Olivia NewtonJohn who has a summer romance with Danny John Travolta. In the fall she discovers that they attend the same school Rydell High and that Danny is the leader of a greaser gang called the T birds. Their different attitudes naturally bring conflict into their immature relationship. Sandy finally becomes convinced that she must turn herself into a tart in order to keep her man and proceeds to do precisely that.First a few compliments to the movie. I'm a big fan of Olivia NewtonJohn and her earlier music think she's lovely in this picture and a lovely lady still. Also John Travolta is a guy with charisma galore I loved him in Saturday Night Fever. In terms of the music my favorite piece is Hopelessly Devoted to You a beautiful romantic song that deserved its Oscar. Too bad Sandy feels pressured to have sex with the guy she's hopelessly devoted to. But that's just about where my compliments end and my rating of 4 is mainly from a sense of nostalgia. Wrong messages where to begin? First of all Danny is the leader of a gang whose purpose is rebellion as though teenagers needed any encouragement there Ha ha Well the gang isn't really violent you say? Maybe not but even the Pink Ladies its female counterpart is at best quite an established clique. Teenagers have enough trouble dealing with peer pressure both then and today. Did they really need a film encouraging them to alter their persona to fit in with the crowd?Sandy begins smoking in order to feel accepted by the Pink Ladies and especially Danny. Way to go Sandy. I don't even need to start mentioning all the negative aspects here.But worst absolute worst...the very obvious message to all teenage girls watching that virginity is just plain unacceptable...you can't possibly expect to keep your man unless you dress provocatively and presumably deliver the goods as well. You know what Sandy you were fine just the way you were at the start...young sweet and innocent. If Danny doesn't like you that way tough let him look elsewhere. YOU keep your self respect girl and find some other guy who WILL appreciate you as you are and not expect anything from you you're not prepared to give.Enough lecturing except to conclude...Yes Grease is the word all right if you want to send a teenager all the wrong messages that is.".

	schema:headline " Charming Sweet and Wonderful!";
	schema:reviewBody "1978's Grease in many eyes is a classic film. It is adored by all ages and it seemingly passes down from generation to generation with love. This is one of the first movies I remember that have a sense of nostalgia. This movie plays well with the baby boomers because it hearkens back to the 1950's when love was swamped in innocence. This movie got the feel of the 1950's correct I have been told. The clothing the background music the charm the acting and the overall look of the movie. The actual songs are 1970's rock'n'roll style and they are wonderful songs. The tone of the movie is upbeat fun and innocent. It may be somewhat predictable but the movie itself was made well.There are a variety of reasons why I enjoy this movie. From the interpretation of the 1950's lifestyle to the wonderful tunes to the themes of true loveall of it elevates this movie into 'classic' territory. However I am irked by a few things though. Mainly the age of the cast. Don't get me wrong I think the performances are wonderful but I despise when movies cast people in their late 20's or early 30's to play teenagers. Now some films can get away with it but not Grease. You can tell that the people in the cast are not teenagers. Check out these ages at the time of movie release. John Travolta was 24 Olivia NewtonJohn was 30 and Stockard Channing was 34!!! But who am I to complain. This movie gave Travolta and NewtonJohn the career boost they needed.As for the story it's nothing new. The story is one that has been told to death but it is all about how a story is told that can make or break a movie. This love story was told with a passion thanks to the highspirited screenplay from Bronte Woodard and the energizing direction from Randall Kleiser. This musical starts off at a California beach in 1959. Complete opposite personalities have fallen in love. Greaser Danny Zuko John Travolta and an Australian chick Sandy Olsson OliviaNewton John. After a summer romance expecting not to see each other again both of them attend Rydell High unbeknownst to each other. They do their own things at first. Danny is a leader of a gang of greasers called the TBirds and Sandy joins the Pink Ladies led by the charming Rizzo Stockard Channing. When they run in to each other for the first time Sandy realizes Danny is a different man from the one she met at the beach. But will that stop her from getting back with Danny? Well just watch the movie! Despite my concerns on the ages of the cast I cannot deny how effective the performances are. In particular John Travolta and Olivia NewtonJohn. Travolta eventually became a major movie star thanks to this movie. He knows how to sing and dance very well for an actor. It seems like he models his character off Elvis Presley. With the hairstyle and the black leather jacket he seems to be Elvislite. He exerts fantastic chemistry with OliviaNewton John. She also sang very well and her performance as the new girl in town is excellent. I liked the supporting cast very much. Stockard Channing did a solid job as the sexhappy leader of the Pink Ladies. Jeff Conaway as Danny's righthand man Kenickie. There are some veteran cast members who did a fine job particularly Eve Arden as Principal McGee and Sid Caesar as Coach Calhoun.I was most impressed with Grease.

The music is great and most of these songs will stick in your brain for a lifetime. Such numbers to keep an eye out for are Hopelessly Devoted To You and You're The One That I Want. The former song actually went on to be nominated for an Oscar. This film is all about song and dance. Two of my favorite sequences include the ballroom dance scene which was being filmed for national television and it features some slick dance moves. My other favorite scene is the ending dance sequence at the school's carnival. Very fun! On the whole this film is upbeat sweet and a film to remember.My Grade A".

	onyx:emotionText "1978's Grease in many eyes is a classic film. It is adored by all ages and it seemingly passes down from generation to generation with love. This is one of the first movies I remember that have a sense of nostalgia. This movie plays well with the baby boomers because it hearkens back to the 1950's when love was swamped in innocence. This movie got the feel of the 1950's correct I have been told. The clothing the background music the charm the acting and the overall look of the movie. The actual songs are 1970's rock'n'roll style and they are wonderful songs. The tone of the movie is upbeat fun and innocent. It may be somewhat predictable but the movie itself was made well.There are a variety of reasons why I enjoy this movie. From the interpretation of the 1950's lifestyle to the wonderful tunes to the themes of true loveall of it elevates this movie into 'classic' territory. However I am irked by a few things though. Mainly the age of the cast. Don't get me wrong I think the performances are wonderful but I despise when movies cast people in their late 20's or early 30's to play teenagers. Now some films can get away with it but not Grease. You can tell that the people in the cast are not teenagers. Check out these ages at the time of movie release. John Travolta was 24 Olivia NewtonJohn was 30 and Stockard Channing was 34!!! But who am I to complain. This movie gave Travolta and NewtonJohn the career boost they needed.As for the story it's nothing new. The story is one that has been told to death but it is all about how a story is told that can make or break a movie. This love story was told with a passion thanks to the highspirited screenplay from Bronte Woodard and the energizing direction from Randall Kleiser. This musical starts off at a California beach in 1959. Complete opposite personalities have fallen in love. Greaser Danny Zuko John Travolta and an Australian chick Sandy Olsson OliviaNewton John. After a summer romance expecting not to see each other again both of them attend Rydell High unbeknownst to each other. They do their own things at first. Danny is a leader of a gang of greasers called the TBirds and Sandy joins the Pink Ladies led by the charming Rizzo Stockard Channing. When they run in to each other for the first time Sandy realizes Danny is a different man from the one she met at the beach. But will that stop her from getting back with Danny? Well just watch the movie! Despite my concerns on the ages of the cast I cannot deny how effective the performances are. In particular John Travolta and Olivia NewtonJohn. Travolta eventually became a major movie star thanks to this movie. He knows how to sing and dance very well for an actor. It seems like he models his character off Elvis Presley. With the hairstyle and the black leather jacket he seems to be Elvislite. He exerts fantastic chemistry with OliviaNewton John. She also sang very well and her performance as the new girl in town is excellent. I liked the supporting cast very much. Stockard Channing did a solid job as the sexhappy leader of the Pink Ladies. Jeff Conaway as Danny's righthand man Kenickie. There are some veteran cast members who did a fine job particularly Eve Arden as Principal McGee and Sid Caesar as Coach Calhoun.I was most impressed with Grease.

To its credit it does have energy ... lots of high voltage zing and zest hyper kinetic hubbub in that optimistic spirit of high school days with all that singing dancing and chattering like magpies. And the production design and costumes are colorful and splashy.Grease also has two terrific songs that function as musical bookends. At the beginning we get to hear Grease Is The Word sung by Frankie Valli. I've always liked that song. And near the end John Travolta and Olivia NewtonJohn dazzle and electrify with the snappy pulsating sounds of You're The One That I Want ... oooooo honey. Marvelous.Trouble is both those songs engender a 1970's disco flavor into a film ostensibly about the 1950s. So where are all those really great oldiesbutgoodies? Shanana sings a few oldies like Elvis' Hound Dog. But the missed musical opportunities are striking.The film's story about high school romance is not original. And the plot is choppy and lacks scene transitions or any sense of logical progression or flow. Plot points seem placed almost in random order a result of poor script structure.Although the film is a comedy the jokes aren't really funny. The writers are trying too hard and the humor comes across as forced and unnatural.One of the worst elements of Grease is the Greased Lightning segment which has John Travolta acting like a jerk as he struts and prances in an auto garage. Wearing too much makeup he comes across as a poor imitation of 1970's singer Freddie Mercury from the 1970's rock band Queen.The film's casting is terrible. Most of them look too old to be high school seniors. Not for a microsecond did I think Stockard Channing was 17 years old.What's good about this film is really really good. And what's bad is really really bad. But overall Grease fails to engender a sense of the 1950s. Instead it looks sounds and feels like an homage to the 1970s disco era.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've always found 'Grease' to be a troubling and often very lazy piece of theatre. Above any show I have ever seen has always been about creating caricatures and yet we are expected to care about these caricatures. I like a few of the songs on a certain level but as a narrative with characters and motivation I am afraid to say that I think 'Grease' is a mess of epic quality. The 1978 film adaptation is no different. While I think 'Grease' is a show that is hard to do well I think the movie might just be the worst version of the show that I have seen precisely because it is so iconic. Travolta and Olivia Newton John created icons free of motivation real conflict and conviction. 'Grease' is loud and noisy but never does it feel populated by human beings and this is due to horrible performances.The greatest problem with 'Grease' is that it has no real central conflict to the story. It definitely feels as if it has captured something in the ballpark of adolescence. Yet 'Grease's definition of adolescence is such a distortion to bring out the easiest forms of theatricality. The problems faced in 'Grease' about blossoming sexuality and societal masks exist but 'Grease' not only confounds them but creates characters that make them seem the be all end all's. The quintessential grade school meaning of life question does he like me or not is not a good enough starting point. The show is about triviality especially in the Sandy and Danny romance because we both know they love each other and they both essentially have a similar circle of friends but the conflict that keeps these lovers apart is all about what clothes they wear. The actors have been given a near impossible task to overcome to make these caricatures characters. If singing in a musical should be the pinnacle of a character's emotional need to speak out than these characters are emotionally warped. The musical numbers are loud and well choreographed and sung but they feel so far detached. And I grant that reality isn't necessarily what one looks for but a certain sense of reality is needed in rooting these characters. Because everything is so false in the acting we feel like we are being lied to. That essentially what acting is lying but never do we get to that baseness unless something is really off or consciously dissected.Because the songs do not come from a place of realitynot even heightened reality the whole musical seems cartoonish. I think a particularly good example of the actor's failure is when actress Stockard Channing's Rizzo sings Look At Me I'm Sandra Dee. Channing is a great singer but a lousy actress. Granted the scene is Rizzo making fun of Sandy because of her insecurities and I think that really is a compelling place to start a scene but even in her attempt to create a sarcastic caricature she seems over the top. I think it is telling that even in a moment where the play is trying to be over the top that it still comes off as too over the top. Channing creates horrible choices with her body jerking herself around in such mechanical unnatural ways. Her voice accents every lyrical quality of the music in such a blunt and violent matter that we don't notice the lyrics of the song. I've always found the ending to 'Grease' to be very troubling and I think the happy go lucky quality to 'You're the One That I Want' really shows this. I was more opposed to the crowd than anything else. I think this is important because it shows that even in a musical where you don't sing but are there there has to be a motivation and conviction to being there. The crowd scenes in musicals are hard to pull off well because you have to think about every actor creating a motivation for a whole crowd to erupt in song. The show ends with Sandy essentially giving up all her moral high ground and convictions and becoming like Danny who has not mutually changed himself. I can see why Sandy and Danny all dance but why the crowd? Shouldn't this moment have been merely between Sandy and Danny? They go into a funhouse and yet you see the hands of Danny's gang poking through the windows and they are there at the end. Why? I don't think the actors or the director thought hard here because they appear like gorillas and it makes the ending troubling. It can't just be gratuitous placement of characters even if they don't sing and just dance they still have to have motivation. If one doesn't just sit back and turn their brain off here than the ending feels symbolically like rape. I realize I might be looking too hard into this but I DID care about Sandy in a way. The inclusion of these apes actually left me after viewing 'Grease' to think that Danny wasn't going to shape up and so the lyrics ultimately meant nothing and Sandy's metamorphosis is a defeat. Having the lyrics mean nothing is the worst thing you can do in a musical. It is telling that this happens in 'Grease' during it's most famous number.Sure 'Grease' may be escapist and the musical quality I suppose is kind of fun but the acting is awful. I want to see a production of 'Grease' which has Danny and Sandy in it and not the bad boy and the nice girl with their groupies.".

And I grant that reality isn't necessarily what one looks for but a certain sense of reality is needed in rooting these characters. Because everything is so false in the acting we feel like we are being lied to. That essentially what acting is lying but never do we get to that baseness unless something is really off or consciously dissected.Because the songs do not come from a place of realitynot even heightened reality the whole musical seems cartoonish. I think a particularly good example of the actor's failure is when actress Stockard Channing's Rizzo sings Look At Me I'm Sandra Dee. Channing is a great singer but a lousy actress. Granted the scene is Rizzo making fun of Sandy because of her insecurities and I think that really is a compelling place to start a scene but even in her attempt to create a sarcastic caricature she seems over the top. I think it is telling that even in a moment where the play is trying to be over the top that it still comes off as too over the top. Channing creates horrible choices with her body jerking herself around in such mechanical unnatural ways. Her voice accents every lyrical quality of the music in such a blunt and violent matter that we don't notice the lyrics of the song. I've always found the ending to 'Grease' to be very troubling and I think the happy go lucky quality to 'You're the One That I Want' really shows this. I was more opposed to the crowd than anything else. I think this is important because it shows that even in a musical where you don't sing but are there there has to be a motivation and conviction to being there. The crowd scenes in musicals are hard to pull off well because you have to think about every actor creating a motivation for a whole crowd to erupt in song. The show ends with Sandy essentially giving up all her moral high ground and convictions and becoming like Danny who has not mutually changed himself. I can see why Sandy and Danny all dance but why the crowd? Shouldn't this moment have been merely between Sandy and Danny? They go into a funhouse and yet you see the hands of Danny's gang poking through the windows and they are there at the end. Why? I don't think the actors or the director thought hard here because they appear like gorillas and it makes the ending troubling. It can't just be gratuitous placement of characters even if they don't sing and just dance they still have to have motivation. If one doesn't just sit back and turn their brain off here than the ending feels symbolically like rape. I realize I might be looking too hard into this but I DID care about Sandy in a way. The inclusion of these apes actually left me after viewing 'Grease' to think that Danny wasn't going to shape up and so the lyrics ultimately meant nothing and Sandy's metamorphosis is a defeat. Having the lyrics mean nothing is the worst thing you can do in a musical. It is telling that this happens in 'Grease' during it's most famous number.Sure 'Grease' may be escapist and the musical quality I suppose is kind of fun but the acting is awful. I want to see a production of 'Grease' which has Danny and Sandy in it and not the bad boy and the nice girl with their groupies.";

Now I'm not saying that this movie is in the same league as Citizen Kane but that doesn't mean it's bad.

Luckily that does not apply to this film every aspect of this film is great from the surprise cameo by CHUBS Carl Weathers to Harvey Keitel's hilarious turn as Papa Satan. You've gotta love a movie that lets Quentin Tarantino use his unique acting ability to his advantage in a brilliant performance as the religious zealot. My favorite cameo belongs to BMovie God Clint Howard...after this movie I don't think I'll ever look at him the same way again! The Cameos are worth the ticket price alone!The story was topnotch and was brilliantly executed. This film definitely shows maturity in Adam Sandler and Tim Herlihy's writing abilities as they created a complex and involving storyline and great and hilarious characters.I recommend this film to any film fans. Give this one a shot regardless of your personal view of Sandler and his talent. Sandler is one of the most underrated and ridiculed acts out there today which is sad considering his remarkable talent.

	schema:reviewBody "When I first watched this movie I was cracking up!  And it was one of those incidents in which I was in a crowded theater where I was pretty much the ONLY one laughing at most of the gags!  It wasn't exactly embarrassing but kind of weird.  Then again most of the people that came to see it were mothers and fathers with little children.  Please ignore the PG13 ratingthis is NOT a movie for the young ones!  I think anyone who has seen Sandler's previous films should know that by now.  His sense of humor may be immature but that doesn't mean it's appropriate for little eyes to see. I watched this movie again after I bought the DVD.  First of all I was impressed to discover the cool Easter eggs!  It's actually the first DVD to be presented in InfiniFilm.  But since it was used as an Easter egg it wasn't credited as the first InfiniFilm feature.  Well as I learned a lot more about the behindthescenes work on this movie mostly involving special effects makeup costume and set design I gained a better respect for those who were responsible for making Little Nicky.  I thought of it as more than a shallow comedy.  It's obvious that the producers of Sandler's previous films didn't have to bend over backwards to produce any flashy effectsin fact most of them were made on a modest budget. However the laughs faded away a little.  Since this is a silly superficial comedy don't expect to pick up on any subtle humor that you might've missed the first time around.  I always found Sandler's schtick very silly and meaningless.  But he's one of those guys who can make me laugh at things for no apparent reason.  Almost as if I'm laughing AT him.  I've seen Billy Madison countless times and I still roll with laughter every time.  But with Little Nicky most of the jokes that I found sillyfunny on my initial viewing were just silly on my second.One thing to anticipate is a stellar cast.  You'll be surprised at the kind of celebrities that pop up in the cameos.  Some of the bigname stars include Harvey Keitel Patricia Arquette Quentin Tarantino Reese Witherspoon and my personal hero Rodney Dangerfield!  And that's just to name a few.  It would also help if you've seen Sandler's past films especially in one particular scene with one of our mystery cameos.  You'll be treated to a great inside joke.  And of course expect to see many of Sandler's regulars including Allen Covert Clint Howard Peter Dante Blake Clark and Jon Lovitz.    Little Nicky is not a thoughtful piece and will probably do nothing to contribute to mankind.  But it's a very funny comedy that I simply advise you don't watch over and over again.  You'll enjoy it a lot the first time! Of course the DVD has some really cool features so if anything pick that up.  My score  7 out of 10".

Roasted upon its release as one of the worst films of all time Little Nicky turns out to be an okay comedy. Actually this is the kind of movie that has all of the ingredients to be a screamingly funny comedy but somehow things don't work. Nicky the son of the devil and an angel is sent to make his way in the world while one of his many brothers tries to take throne of Hell from their father. Casting everyone from Harvey Keitel to Rodney Dangerfield this is a film that fits into the Adam Sandler universe since several characters from some of his other films appear. Its a film that on star power alone should work but it never catches fire. Sure there are laughs but on the whole nothing ever hangs together to form a full movie. I've seen the film several times and can't figure out what went wrong. Even Adam Sandler as Nicky in one of the worst portrayals in screen history isn't the reason this doesn't work. There is something else some other reason.Still its worth seeing if you like okay comedies. It never scales the heights its ideas and bits say it should be reaching. If its on try it and see if its for you you certainly could do worse.".

	schema:headline " One or two good moments in a film of basic unfunny bad taste moments with a cast that looked good on paper but are either bad embarrassing wasted or all three";
	schema:reviewBody "Satan has decided to stay in charge of Hell for a few more years a decision that enrages two of his sons Adrian and Cassius who decide to create their own Hell on Earth and rule there instead. Whenever they leave Hell Satan's powers begin to fade and has less than a week before he will be destroyed. With no choice but to send his third weaker son Satan sends Nicky to Earth to capture his brothers and bring them back to Hell and restore the norm. However the simple and nave Nicky struggles to cut it in the real world.I will always give Adam Sadler films a go because I often find just about enough moments of inspired lunacy among the puerile and pretty unfunny material. Sadly this outing sees such a terrible plot combined with awful acting unfunny writing tired special effects and crude joking and almost no moments that took me by surprise and made me laugh. Instead the film is just plain stupid with very few laughs in it at all. Of course it may well appeal to some with its silly humour and its silly crude joking but personally it was pretty laugh free and the whole idea of the film was too dumb and silly to really work. The actual plot is never a really strong aspect of any Sadler film but here it is just all over the place. It is not that it makes no sense it is more that it lacks any sense of fun at all and the dark tone is totally misjudged and the usual moments of inspired craziness is really limited to one or two moments the best being the Fonz covered in bees!.The crp script is not helped at all by a cast that is either rubbish or wasted. Sadler himself falls into the 'rubbish' camp with a performance that is like his usual mugging but even more unbearable. With his twisted expression and nasty voice he was actually painful to watch  and this is not based on a hatred of Sadler I loved him in Punchdrunk a few days ago it is based on the fact that this is a terrible performance with nothing but a terrible idea and a terrible character to work with. The support cast is made up of plenty of wellknown faces but few are used well at all and too many of them are embarrassing. Keitel falls into the latter category and he has a thankless role that is not worthy of his talent. Ifans and Lister are given hard work by mostly doing voice work with poor dialogue in their heads and they were not funny at all. Arquette is given nothing to do at all but still manages to be lame and annoying. The various cameos are mixed  Taratino is just dumb Dangerfield is OK but not given enough time Weathers Witherspoon Witherspoon and others are all given nothing to do other than show their faces but Lovitz and Schneider at least provide some unexpected weirdness in very minor roles.Overall Sadler films are normally average at best but I must say that I found this to be devoid of all but the slightest hint of the inspired humour that he can often create. The story is stupid and silly the acting both bad and embarrassing the script filled with misfiring jokes that are mostly in bad taste as well as being unfunny a bad combination. A real waste of time that will only appeal to the most diehard fans of Sadler and those that only like their comedy to be very basic indeed.".

Little Nicky unlike Plan 9 From Outer Space isn't even unintentionally funny.

	schema:reviewBody "Sigh looking through my VHS collection and biting the bullet to rewatch this piece of sht was the easy part. Within the first 3 minutes you already know what your in for a peeping tom dies and goes to hell to get humped by a actor dressed like a big bird meanwhile 'I'm your boogie man' is playing in the background. We're introduced to Nicky who 'jams' with some large random weapon his dad's assistant is basically used as the introduction to the plot his dad the devil played by Harvey Keitel for some odd reason is making the decision on who should be his successor for then next 10000 years. It never explains why someones 'in office' for 10000 years but there's not much need to care anyways. He also remarks on how Nicky was pretty until his brother hit him in the face with a shovel foreshadowing his brothers as the antagonists. Basically his dad declares himself ruler for another 10000 years and Nicky's 2 brothers go to earth freezing the gate to hell thus causing the devil to die for some reason? Keitel's finger falls off and Nicky starts his journey to return his brothers to hell.Probably about 10 minutes in now the first thing that sticks out is Sander. Sandler while acceptable in just about all his other movies to this date excluding that one where he's on a boat. he's fcking terrible in this. No words can explain how bad his performance is its shallow its halfased its not funny its just ridiculously awful. To quote another disappointing movie the ringer 'I've seen better acting in porno'. As a whole the supporting cast is also terrible. Nicky's sidekick i guess you'd say is a talking pitbull glances at a doorstep that says 'i love acting' on it he pises on it and says 'you love acting well i love pising' and to make matters even more mind numbingly awful the pis is cgi'd obviously. Oh thats the next thing the effects and production. This paragraphs dedicated to acting so let me get back on track. Usual members from the happy Madison gang are here i've spotted like 4 people that are also in grandmas boy and other crap flicks like the animal and Mr deeds and crap. Performances are half ased too at most times secondary actor just read a line or two devoid of emotion or any form of acting. One standout role though is Quinton Tarantinos cameo as a blind preacher who appears about 3 times other then that nothing.The production is awful. Hell looks for lack of a better and less offensive term retarded. There is around 3 sets I've noticed. Nickys room the entrance to hell and the INSANELY BOTCHED throne. Nicky's room is literally covered in stickers of heavy metal bands problem is i counted like over 9000 Ozzy stickers and one big metallica one obviously the set designers know nothing about metal nor the crewcast. The throne is just like a mass hall except the size of a small house basement there's nothing that resembles artistic detail at all it'd pass for a normal room to me. the gates also stupid there's some rock like walls and a cheap frozen fire effect for the gate it self no effort seemed to be used. the sad thing is the gate is easily the most used. The rest of the sets on earth are one apartment room a basketball stadium thingI'm not a sports fan. a park shoot and the rest is all sidewalks. Oh yeah hell breaks loose by the end and the sets turn into cgi awfulness its so awful that by that point i went on my laptop and started chatting. The CGI is as awful as you'd expect from 19992000 but...its used throughout the whole movie. in fact all the special effects in the movie were cgi i noticed of abysmal quality.Last thing i'm going to rant about is the script 'What we're they thinking!?'  avgn. Its a comedy to be a 'good' comedy it has to be funny. Unfortantly it isn't its like a stream of half baked jokes like Nicky spinning his head around to entertain his friends Oh he's doing the exorcist thing thats pure comedy. and Satan sticking a pineapple up Hitler's as. At a glance you'r still likely to ask to your self 'whats the point.'. The plot it self is rubbish. If two brothers out of hell for some reason make the devil have 'a week' to live wouldn't another one shorten his life span even more thus making his coming to earth a bad idea. The brothers deceiving the humans is also like 'wut?'. They possess a minister and tell everyone 'let the Sin beGin' to which a completely packed church gets out of their seat and everyone starts cheering. Yeah thats very likely to happen. These parts are somewhat spaced out because until like the last 20 minutes Nicky does nothing but walk around and do nothing. None of the jokes are funny the plot is literally insane its lost in its own continuity also.i'm not going to spell check this review cause i feel that the movie sucked so bad that it's not worth the time of what i've already written. It sucks it sucks even on a Adam Sander level. Its not funny its not entertaining its just downright lame. Bad script bad acting bad story bad production bad just about everything. To the mind of a child its acceptable but for a audience over 12 The movies rated pg13 by the way. its damn near worth destroying. I wouldn't watch this movie again if i were paid too even for a million i'd rather have my dignity.".

Unfortunately neither Stiller nor Allen were involved with this movie which in the final analysis is much less.'  As in witless' tasteless' and humorless.'  Oh it'll make you laugh at times but you'll hate yourself in the morning for it.  Simply put in regards to credible comedy Little Nicky' directed by Steven Brill comes in somewhere near the bottom of the food chain cinematically speaking.  One of the running gags in this film has Nicky responding metaphorically to whomever when they ask where he comes from The south the deep' south'  Which is somehow ironic because that's exactly where this kind of humor seemingly originates and belongs.Satan Harvey Keitel has come to the end of his tenthousand year reign in Hell and has called together his three sons Adrian Rhys Ifans Cassius Tom Tiny' Lister Jr. and Little Nicky Adam Sandler to announce which of the three he has chosen to succeed him as ruler of the Nether world for the next tenthousand years.  Suffice to say that his decision is not well received by the boys however at least not by Adrian and Cassius who rebel by bolting from this most southern of regions to take up residence in the topside world of the mortals the souls of whom it is their inherent duty to corrupt.  But in so doing they inadvertently freeze the fire at the gates of Hell rendering them impassable to all the fallen souls who would enter there and so it is destined to remain until the two return which they are not likely to do of their own accord.  The situation quickly takes it's toll on the health of Satan who in his suddenly weakened state is unable to pursue the errant pair himself and since only a spawn of Satan can match up to another spawn of Satan the job falls to Little Nicky the only other one around who meets the criteria who is summarily dispatched to earth to collect his brothers and bring them back down to Hell whereupon the fire will be rekindled the gates reopened and all will once again be...well...'bad.'  It's a tough assignment though as Nicky's brothers have the ability to possess anyone in the world they so choose which will make identifying them something of a problem.  Not to worry however Satan is providing some help for Nicky a dog named Mr. Beefy voice of Robert Smigel who has experience among the mortals and will be able to help Nicky negotiate what to him will be virgin territory.  And with that Nicky is off on his quest and the laughs begin.  Not!The story itself is a flight of fancy a fantasy which on paper at any rate probably had some possibilities if only it had been placed in more capable hands.  Brill was given a golden opportunity to deliver a movie with some real snap and zing to it but he dropped the ball big time and instead presents the material with little imagination and the result is a very basic whatyouseeiswhatyouget type of film.  There's just nothing beneath the surface at all.  Sure it's a comedy and that's debatable but even a film that's not supposed to be taken seriously has to have some substance to it and this one does not.  It almost seems as if Brill approached the project with the attitude that Adam Sandler's presence alone would make whatever he put up on the screen work.  Bad miscalculation.  Scenes that could have been clever or at least mined for some real humor are for the most part simply crude and in most cases lack any redeeming merit whatsoever.  His biggest mistake though was putting all his eggs in one basket by expecting Sandler to carry the day and the film just by showing up.  He apparently didn't understand that Sandler is an actor who needs a director who can keep him on task he needs direction and plenty of it and he didn't get it from Brill.Sandler has been better much better as Robbie in The Wedding Singer' for instance or even as Bobby in The Waterboy.'  Both films in which he created a character that was at least credible or viable within the context of the story.  But his Nicky' just doesn't get the job done because he fails to even really create a character at all but instead plays at' creating a character which is something else entirely.  Someone and the most likely suspect would be Brill should have told him that merely contorting his face and exaggerating the perpetually pubescent whine in his voice is not what it takes to create' a real character.  And regardless of the genre in which the actor is playing it's absolutely essential that the character he presents is real and believable within the environment and the setting of the story.  If he's playing a devil in Hell that devil had better be real or it's simply not going to work and this film proves it. And lowering the bar to go after cheap laughs can't save it either. The supporting cast includes Rodney Dangerfield Lucifer Patricia Arquette Valerie Peter Dante Peter Jonathan Loughran John Dana Carvey Referee Jon Lovitz Peeper Kevin Nealon Gatekeeper Michael McKean Chief of Police Quentin Tarantino Deacon and Reese Witherspoon Holly.  A real artist will earn every laugh he gets and it's genuine it's something real and it's worthwhile.  This film generates some laughs to be sure but they're not earned and consequently they're plastic and they're disposable.  And yes there IS a difference.  Any doubts just ask Ben Stiller or Woody Allen.  Or Steve Martin or Lucille Ball Joan Davis Red Skelton or W.C. Fields.  And while you're at it maybe you can pass on what you learn to Adam Sandler.  It may help.  110.".

See there is no context for this sight gag it makes absolutely no sense. It's like that weird longlost clip of the Marx Brothers pilot for their 60s show that surfaced several years ago it was bizarre and unfunny something about angels and they're all well into their sixties.

This movie is unsettlingly bizarre and strangely unfunny.Having said all that the only nice thing about this movie is the fledgling romance between Valerie and Nicky in the beginning of the movie it's very sweet but quickly gets lost in the ensuing craporama that follows.";

It's very interesting and is nicely done.  It takes advantage of the slower parts in the early scenes to draw attention to the stage the players and the crowd giving you a very good feel for what the theater was like then. Olivier also uses this device to liven up considerably the long historical discourse of the Archbishop of Canterbury in the play's second scene.After the early scenes when the real action begins the movie wisely pulls away from the theater setting and concentrates on the story itself.  Olivier is always good in this kind of role and the photography and settings do a good job of setting off the action.  It is noticeable though that Olivier chose to omit several scenes or portions of scenes that have some of the commands showing Henry's harsher characteristics so that the movie concentrates much more on the king's heroic side.  What's left still works fine but it does lose a little depth without this balance.  The rest of the cast is certainly adequate though most of them are overshadowed by Henry. A couple of the exceptions are Robert Newton very well cast as Pistol and Esmond Knight who works well as Fluellen.Some minor aspects may keep it from being one of the best Shakespeare adaptations but it's creative distinctive and good entertainment.

The first and most important thing is the timing. Incredible!! Olivier managed to get the whole thing together in time for DDay! sorry that was not quite relevant The fact is his portrayal of King Henry V had a deliberate purpose to it... he wanted to give England courage in the war they were fighting just as King Harry had courage against the french.  Everything the sets the colours all are so majestic and wonderfully theatrical. That's because Olivier did not want to keep his audience on the indifferent grounds of reality. For many in 1944 winning the war was something totally out of reality just as it was so for the English at the battle of Agincourt. Olivier wished to transport his audience to the godgiven victory and transport them he did.   Once more unto the breach! Even as a little fourteenyearold viewer of Sir Laurence speaking these famous words this gave me the curious inspiration... the same that it gave to Winston Churchill sixty years ago. For me I don't know what the inspiration was for. For Churchill it was claiming victory in world war 2.  Whatever your taste background or personality this film is inspirational and recommended viewing for everyone. You would be missing something terrible if you did not see this pure patron of an actor grace the screen majestically with his regal inspiration.".

	schema:reviewBody "The film precisely met the requirement to raise moral of Englishmen during the Second World War it is cheering and inspiring. But in fact it is more than just a patriotic propaganda. Henry V though made during the war is an excellent beginning of the series of Olivier's Shakespearean films. I really like it as much as later Hamlet and Richard III. May be the play doesn't seem very distinguished when you read it but the screenversion becomes exciting complex and brilliant. It has the amusing beginning clever allusion to medieval Shakespearean theatre heroic main part without unnecessary battle details and touching happy ending the scene of Henry wooing Princess Katharine moves me every time I watch it. Lord Laurence is so noble as the King Henry! You can really feel his inspiration and share his emotions. Whenever Olivier's a producer it's his habit to focus the audience's attention mostly on the main character. Sometimes I think his selection of plays for filming was determined by the amount of time his hero must be on the stage. Well to say the truth it's perfectly justified! There never was and never will be any Shakespearean actor comparable to Laurence Olivier! His performance is superb. In the part of Henry the Fifth he is absolutely fascinating far above any real monarch in dignity nobility and attractiveness. In fact the whole film is fascinating and picturesque. Princess Katharine is very charming and adequate and other actors are well chosen too. The way English actors pronounce Shakespearean text is always more natural and expressive than the way of any other nation's actors distinguished as they may be. I dare say that Englishmen understand something about Shakespeare that we can't get.  Anyone who truly estimates Shakespeare must love this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Previous to this film Laurence Olivier had only one experience with Shakespeare on the screen 1936's As You Like It. It was not a work that Olivier was terribly proud of. He did determine right there that if he were to do Shakespeare again he would have complete creative control. Olivier did just that on this film and every other filmed adaption of the Bard that he was involved in.Olivier's desire happily coincided with Winston Churchill's desire to make some good British propaganda for the war effort. Churchill was fond of what he called Shakespeare's war plays and Henry V definitely qualifies in that category. He gave Olivier whatever logistical help he needed and remember a war was on. Even to the extent of arranging with Eamon DeValera permission for Olivier to bring the entire Henry V crew to the Irish Republic so that the outdoor scenes could be filmed away from Nazi bombardment. Olivier chooses an interesting method of introducing the play. It opens with a scene of 16th century London at the Globe Theatre at the opening night. The play begins with Leslie Banks as the Chorus reading the introduction and the first scenes are filmed as simply a photographed stage play. After that first scene at Henry V at his court spitting defiance at the French herald and having his retainers go through an elaborate justification for his claim to the French throne. We then as the Chorus bids us have our imagination take flight until the end of the play when it returns to the stage this time with Henry V marrying the French princess and sealing his claim to their throne.I believe what Olivier wanted to do was show the play through two sets of eyes. He wants the audience to imagine they are in Elizabethan England watching the events of a century before and know that things looked pretty grim then for England and they pulled out of it.The battle scenes at Harfleur and at Agincourt are nicely staged and photographed. Olivier's Henry V is a strong and virile leader convinced of the rightness of his cause and he has the confidence in himself as military leader to see it through. Kind of like the Prime Minister who was in office then.Certainly in the Middle Ages the high point of English arms was at Agincourt. It was truly one lopsided victory English longbowmen against French knights. The French cavalry was truly decimated on that day and a lot of their nobility was killed. And the French were the betting favorites.Seen today though it's a bit different. The Hundred Years War and this was the second phase of it was quite frankly a naked war of aggression by the English to obtain the French throne. In 1944 audiences thrilled to remember this impressive feet of arms by the English but the reasons were kind of glossed over.Still Henry V is an impressive motion picture and I'm sure it did what it set out to do be a morale booster for the English public. Among other performers I liked in this were Robert Newton as the ancient Pistol and Leslie Banks as the chorus and Valentine Dyall as the Duke of Burgundy.But I would wager that Charles DeGaulle was not invited to the premier showing of Henry V.".

	schema:headline " Still be kind and eke out our performance with your mind";
	schema:reviewBody "It's perhaps surprising that when people from a theatrical background turn to film directing they tend to produce pictures that are purely cinematic and freed from staginess. This is the case with Laurence Olivier as it was with Rouben Mamoulian and Orson Welles. Here with his debut feature as director Olivier not only created a landmark propaganda film but also redefined the screen Shakespeare adaptation and established a new precedent of renowned actor turning competent director.Shakespeare's play of Henry V was of course ideal for a wartime morale booster featuring as it does heroic action rousing speeches historical parallels with the landings at France a protagonist who is valiant yet warm and humane as well as plenty of little extra touches such as exploring the psychology of the troops on the eve of battle and stressing the need for unity between English Irish Scotch and Welsh. It was also the perfect play for Olivier to test his ideas on how a Shakespeare play should be turned into a film. The chorus of Shakespeare's original text tells the audience that the great battles and courts can scarcely be contained on a stage and that you must on your imaginative forces work. Using this idea as his starting point Olivier begins the film with a recreation of a contemporary production of the original play at the Globe theatre complete with backstage glimpses bumbling actors and a rowdy Elizabethan audience. Then as Leslie Banks' chorus commands the audience to work your thoughts the theatre disappears and the action subtly opens out into larger sets. Eventually we are transported to location with thousands of extras for the climactic battle scene.This was not only a complete reworking of screen Shakespeare it was part of a whole approach to cinema. Olivier's Henry V although totally different in content is stylistically in the same tradition as Michael Powell's The Red Shoes or the elaborate ballet sequences of MGM musicals which also expand wouldbe stage performances into pure cinematic fantasy. The originator of this approach was probably Busby Berkeley who also made the switch from stage to screen albeit from the music hall to the role of choreographer for screen musicals. The musical sequences that Berkeley constructed for Warner Brothers musicals in the mid1930s always begin with a stage production but then turn into tourdeforces of choreography camera positioning and massive sets all of which could never be contained or properly appreciated on a stage. Olivier is effectively doing the same thing with a Shakespeare play as Berkeley did with a dancing chorus line.Of course all this alone isn't what makes Henry V a great work. For a firsttime director Olivier's eye is remarkably sharp. He keeps the action smooth in dialogue scenes by making use of long takes and preferring to move the camera to change the framing rather than breaking the shot with a cut often dollying in on a single actor to achieve a closeup. He's not quite experienced enough yet though to give these shots a really natural flow and he doesn't really get the chance to show off his talents as a dramatic director as he would later in Hamlet and Richard III. Having said that he does manage to give remarkable tenderness to Henry's soliloquy on the eve of battle and his courtship of Kate towards the end of the film.The highpoint however is the impressive Agincourt battle sequence which was influenced by the battle in Eisenstein's Alexander Nevsky but is actually an improvement on the Russian master's equivalent work. He similarly builds up tension as the opposing army begins its charge using a rhythmic editing pattern and dynamic closeups. However whereas Alexander Nevsky's battle occasionally looked obviously staged and unrealistic in Henry V you could as well be witnessing a genuine medieval battle.Olivier selected a top notch cast composed of actors with theatre experience like himself with exuberant performances from Robert Newton as the cowardly Pistol and Esmond Knight as Welsh captain Fluellen and too many other great names to mention. Olivier himself after a decade of learning how to act for screen perhaps relished the chance to give huge concerthallfilling Shakespearean delivery again although he does manage to rein his performance in again for the quieter scenes.Henry V is remarkable for a director's debut feature. Olivier would direct two more prestigious Shakespeare adaptations as well as a few dramas but Henry V is his freshest and most engaging work as a director and still remains the best.".

	onyx:emotionText "It's perhaps surprising that when people from a theatrical background turn to film directing they tend to produce pictures that are purely cinematic and freed from staginess. This is the case with Laurence Olivier as it was with Rouben Mamoulian and Orson Welles. Here with his debut feature as director Olivier not only created a landmark propaganda film but also redefined the screen Shakespeare adaptation and established a new precedent of renowned actor turning competent director.Shakespeare's play of Henry V was of course ideal for a wartime morale booster featuring as it does heroic action rousing speeches historical parallels with the landings at France a protagonist who is valiant yet warm and humane as well as plenty of little extra touches such as exploring the psychology of the troops on the eve of battle and stressing the need for unity between English Irish Scotch and Welsh. It was also the perfect play for Olivier to test his ideas on how a Shakespeare play should be turned into a film. The chorus of Shakespeare's original text tells the audience that the great battles and courts can scarcely be contained on a stage and that you must on your imaginative forces work. Using this idea as his starting point Olivier begins the film with a recreation of a contemporary production of the original play at the Globe theatre complete with backstage glimpses bumbling actors and a rowdy Elizabethan audience. Then as Leslie Banks' chorus commands the audience to work your thoughts the theatre disappears and the action subtly opens out into larger sets. Eventually we are transported to location with thousands of extras for the climactic battle scene.This was not only a complete reworking of screen Shakespeare it was part of a whole approach to cinema. Olivier's Henry V although totally different in content is stylistically in the same tradition as Michael Powell's The Red Shoes or the elaborate ballet sequences of MGM musicals which also expand wouldbe stage performances into pure cinematic fantasy. The originator of this approach was probably Busby Berkeley who also made the switch from stage to screen albeit from the music hall to the role of choreographer for screen musicals. The musical sequences that Berkeley constructed for Warner Brothers musicals in the mid1930s always begin with a stage production but then turn into tourdeforces of choreography camera positioning and massive sets all of which could never be contained or properly appreciated on a stage. Olivier is effectively doing the same thing with a Shakespeare play as Berkeley did with a dancing chorus line.Of course all this alone isn't what makes Henry V a great work. For a firsttime director Olivier's eye is remarkably sharp. He keeps the action smooth in dialogue scenes by making use of long takes and preferring to move the camera to change the framing rather than breaking the shot with a cut often dollying in on a single actor to achieve a closeup. He's not quite experienced enough yet though to give these shots a really natural flow and he doesn't really get the chance to show off his talents as a dramatic director as he would later in Hamlet and Richard III. Having said that he does manage to give remarkable tenderness to Henry's soliloquy on the eve of battle and his courtship of Kate towards the end of the film.The highpoint however is the impressive Agincourt battle sequence which was influenced by the battle in Eisenstein's Alexander Nevsky but is actually an improvement on the Russian master's equivalent work. He similarly builds up tension as the opposing army begins its charge using a rhythmic editing pattern and dynamic closeups. However whereas Alexander Nevsky's battle occasionally looked obviously staged and unrealistic in Henry V you could as well be witnessing a genuine medieval battle.Olivier selected a top notch cast composed of actors with theatre experience like himself with exuberant performances from Robert Newton as the cowardly Pistol and Esmond Knight as Welsh captain Fluellen and too many other great names to mention. Olivier himself after a decade of learning how to act for screen perhaps relished the chance to give huge concerthallfilling Shakespearean delivery again although he does manage to rein his performance in again for the quieter scenes.Henry V is remarkable for a director's debut feature. Olivier would direct two more prestigious Shakespeare adaptations as well as a few dramas but Henry V is his freshest and most engaging work as a director and still remains the best.";

	schema:headline " Shakespeare As Poetic Pageant";
	schema:reviewBody "Henry V is poetry within the historical context of English patriotic pageantry. As Shakespearean scholar J. Dover Wilson observed in a 1943 critique it justifies and celebrates a wellordered vision of British conservative values  respect for the monarchy and a rigid feudal classsystem. And as Pauline Kael asserted in 1989 Shakespeare's text is perhaps the greatest jingo play ever conceived.At the beginning a Prologue asks us to imagine a kingdom for a stage princes to act and monarchs to behold the swelling scene rather than the flat unraised spirits...on this unworthy scaffold. Laurence Olivier who directed this 1944 film version heeds the misgivings expressed in that Prologue. While his staging of Henry V begins within the enclosed intimacy of a studiocreated Globe Theatre acted before an appropriately attired Elizabethan audience Olivier uses the medium of Cinema to physically open up the play as it progresses from scene to scene increasingly taking advantage of elaborate studio scenery and lighting and mattes ultimately using vast exterior locations for the climactic Battle of Agincourt.Olivier in the lead role is a forceful King Harry but his work and imagination behind the camera are stunning especially for a firsttime director. The humor of the fumbling unraised spirits who impersonate the roles of the Archbishop of Canterbury Felix Aylmer and the Bishop of Ely Robert Helpmann is an early surprise as is the coarse highjinks of Robert Newton's interpretation of Pistol chewing up the scenery and everyone in sight. As a director Olivier borrows from the conventions of the stage but it isn't so much that he copies them he transforms them. Thus he shows us a fleet of miniature warships engulfed in an English Channel fog a narrator superimposed against painted moving backdrops and at the end the bleak French postwar countryside  a zone of pillage poverty and heartbreak in the aftermath of battle.This version of Henry V was made with a wartime audience in mind. The 'V' in the title is a perfect symbolic reference to the times. Here the effete overconfident Dauphin Max Adrian and other French nobles stand in for the Axis alliance the common men who make up the motley army of archers and infantry are a parallel to the agents of 20thcentury antiauthoritarianism. The French losses total about ten thousand  8400 of which are princes barons lords knights squiresAnd gentlemen of blood and quality. The English fatalities only five and twenty score. An overwhelming victory for the forces of medieval antiFascism.".

	schema:headline " This may be a decent movie but it's bad literature.";
	schema:reviewBody "Even glowing reviews of Olivier's Henry V acknowledge that this movie is a simplified strippeddown version of the classic play the morally ambiguous elements of Henry's character have been hacked out and the story has been made more aggressively patriotic to appeal to a World War II audience.Well...OK...but ain't that rather a big problem? I mean to ask what's so great about seeing Shakespeare doctored up into war propaganda? Certainly the original play was somewhat patriotic and gungho but it also contained moral gray area which is eliminated here. Hence this is an inferior adaptation that waters down its source material.OK so there's no denying that this movie is cleverly staged. The opening scenes set in the Globe are pretty imaginative and there's an energy to the pacing that works. But still so many elements strike a false note. Olivier for instance seems to shout out his lines without subtlety as though trying too hard to generate excitement.I also don't really like the look of the film. The Globe scenes work fine but once Olivier leaves the theater the action is staged on large but incredibly fakelooking sets. The whole production looks too phony too clean too sanitized. Henry doesn't get a splatter of mud or a drop of blood on himself in the battle. It's all ridiculously pristine and safe and not at all daring. In short it's feelgood Shakespeare.Kenneth Branagh's 1989 film version is to be perfectly blunt almost infinitely better than this movie. It's grittier darker and closer to the original play including the moral gray area. By comparison the Olivier version looks like March of the Wooden Soldiers. Don't get me wrong I usually love 1940s movies because I think they have better scripts than contemporary films  but I make an exception for literary adaptations which tend to be more faithful and more powerful today than ever before. Thus the 1980s Henry V can indeed be better than its '40s counterpart.To me this film is best understood in the context of World War II. As a wartime production it's impressive  but it remains tied to that period and therefore it is fundamentally dated. The original play on the other hand is timeless.".

	onyx:emotionText "Even glowing reviews of Olivier's Henry V acknowledge that this movie is a simplified strippeddown version of the classic play the morally ambiguous elements of Henry's character have been hacked out and the story has been made more aggressively patriotic to appeal to a World War II audience.Well...OK...but ain't that rather a big problem? I mean to ask what's so great about seeing Shakespeare doctored up into war propaganda? Certainly the original play was somewhat patriotic and gungho but it also contained moral gray area which is eliminated here. Hence this is an inferior adaptation that waters down its source material.OK so there's no denying that this movie is cleverly staged. The opening scenes set in the Globe are pretty imaginative and there's an energy to the pacing that works. But still so many elements strike a false note. Olivier for instance seems to shout out his lines without subtlety as though trying too hard to generate excitement.I also don't really like the look of the film. The Globe scenes work fine but once Olivier leaves the theater the action is staged on large but incredibly fakelooking sets. The whole production looks too phony too clean too sanitized. Henry doesn't get a splatter of mud or a drop of blood on himself in the battle. It's all ridiculously pristine and safe and not at all daring. In short it's feelgood Shakespeare.Kenneth Branagh's 1989 film version is to be perfectly blunt almost infinitely better than this movie.

	schema:reviewBody "With tensions between England and the arrogant French pushed to breaking point King Henry the Fifth sets out with his armies to conquer and quell the French in their native land.  The film builds up with to the historic battle of Agincourt with the troops and the king camping together and making progress across the land.Whenever Henry V to use the shorten title comes on TV I always tape it simply because I always assume that it is a masterpiece of English cinema  such is it's reputation in many circles.  However this reputation may not be that well deserved as I have decided from my viewing of it today.  The plot is Shakespeare and I will not criticise it but I know myself that it is not a story that I would pick if asked to chose from his canon of work  I prefer the darker stuff or the out and out comedies.  That aside the film tells a straightforward tale here used to raise morale and fly the flag of Britain and England during WWII.  As such it works but I needed it to be more than just a flag waving exercise I wanted more detail and more thought.  Such scenes exist within the play but Olivier does not use them as well as he uses the grandstanding speeches and battle scene  his focus is not on thought but on scale.As director he does quite well in early stages and in the actual battle itself.  The device of opening ad closing in the playhouse works to good effect and is clever but far too many scenes have poor camera angles or are poorly framed.  The battle scene is good but too much of the film is ordinary in terms of looks and style.  As actor Olivier carries the King well but is too one dimensional for me and I didn't have to put any thought into him to watch the film.  He holds back for much of the film but leaps up for more upbeat scenes or rousing speeches.  The support cast all sound natural with the dialogue although some of the roles are a little bit hammy they still hold the film together well.Overall this is an enjoyable film that has good spectacle to it and key scenes are very good.  However the lack of anything under the surface is a problem and it is one of the lesser Shakespearean adaptations I have seen. Still worth a look but if you're like me you'll be left wondering was that it?'".

	schema:reviewBody "My copy is on 2 VCD disks created from a betamax tape recording made almost 25 years ago on an old TV with antenna yet it is still a magnificent film which well repays repeated viewing. Your user comments on this film reveal many interesting facts about it but to me seem to all miss the main point.Both Branagh and Olivier have produced magnificent films of this play with superb acting and direction which have been given outstanding reviews time and again. They are very different ultimately because they were intended to deliver different political messages. Funding for a major motion picture today always requires the Director to meet the expectations of the backers and these films are no exception. Olivier's version was produced in 1944 at a time when there was a serious risk of freedom disappearing from Europe perhaps for centuries. The U.K. had won the battle of Britain but was in imminent risk of losing the vital Battle of the Atlantic. Olivier was at sea involved in this battle and must have been extremely well aware of this risk when he was called upon to make a film which would help boost civilian morale. It's message is therefore essentially prowar. Branagh's version came at the time when the Vietnam war made the public very aware of the need to be convinced any war could lead to benefits that would outweigh the associated pain and destruction. It is therefore essentially an antiwar film. this has led many North Americans to rate it more highly than Olivier's version which I believe is totally unjustified.. Both Directors took liberties with Shakespeare's text to support their objective  in both cases this has weakened the film. The politics which are most relevant to these films are those of Tudor England. Henry V appeared at a time not unlike that when Olivier made his film. It was printed anonymously apparently first appearing in 1598 but no doubt completed well before this. It must have been in gestation at a time when England was or had just been under major threat from the Spanish armada. Its political objective was to exploit the success of a then relatively recent English king for support of the Tudor regime by boosting patriotic fervor for the current monarch. Shakespeare almost always generated well rounded characters so that his heroes clearly displayed their human failings whilst his worst villains showed greatness which was not realized through some often minor human failings his Henry V is a typical mediaeval monarch and any attempts to portray him as either pure patriot or pure aggressor are serious distortions.Olivier's film was created under very serious technical difficulties he could not find a suitable venue in the U.K. and France was clearly unavailable. The Irish government had to be clearly neutral and were largely uncooperative. All supplies were short especially colour stock and he is said to have had only one colour camera available. It is amazing that the film could be completed and the production standard it achieved is almost a miracle. Branagh had the advantage of muddy weather which enabled him to exploit the important historical fact that the bogging down of the French cavalry in mud was a major factor in the English success  but this is not relevant to Shakespeare's play. Ultimately understanding of all these points makes enjoyment of both films greater  but they are only marginally relevant to my assessment. Henry V is one of the very few films which demands to be judged by its contribution to the development of cinematographic art  no doubt this explains Olivier's honorary Oscar.To establish cinematography as an independent art form early directors introduced long panning shots views from tall buildings shots made from trains and planes etc. These successfully distinguished their product from the theatre. Less successfully they began to rely on mood music to register anger fear lust or other emotions. Their problems were made more acute by TV drama and studio bosses unfortunately jumped at the introduction of anamorphic lenses to change the aspect ration of a cinema screen in a typical art gallery perhaps 1015 of the exhibits use an abnormal aspect ratio why should any film director think he can get away with doing so all the time?. Since then the artistic quality of most movies has steadily degenerated giving way to increasingly bizarre and expensive special effects and often to pure fantasy whilst the sound tracks have got louder and even less meaningful. The Shakespearean play with long soliloquies delivered by static characters relies almost entirely on the cadences of the words and could hardly be more remote to modern cinematography. Olivier's genius was his ability to present Shakespearean drama in a way which was meaningful in a cinema and simultaneously to deliver Shakespearean English so effectively that a modern audience almost feels it is contemporary speech. Henry V was a particularly difficult film to treat in this way because of the very length nighttime prebattle scenes where almost total darkness did nothing to help distract the audience from the actors delivery. Later filmmakers owe an enormous debt to Olivier for pointing the way to create successful films that do not fit the stereotypes we expect today.When I try to think of films that have made a major contribution to the art form of cinematography two particularly come to mind  Fantasia which first showed that real music could be a major attraction in a modern film and Henry V where William Walton's magnificent score also contributed greatly to Olivier's triumph. Gone with the Wind is often regarded as another important film in this category. Its production and acting were immaculate although it is greatly overlong and it is an outstanding example of very early and successful use of colour stock. Essentially however it was traditional cinematography for its time and it did not make the same contribution to the development of cinematographic art as either Fantasia or Henry V.".

It actually earned him a special Honary Award during that year's Academy Awards 'for his outstanding achievement as actor producer and director in bringing 'Henry V' to the screen'.It's a real Shakespeare movie so expect lots of stagy looking settings and long dialog. Laurence Olivier however knows to bring it in a good and original way and actually manages to use it's 'stagy' elements to the movie its own advantage.As an historical movie concerning mostly the battle of Agincourt I don't feel the movie is being completely accurate. The movie is a bit too patriotic by purely picking the British side by showing how noble and brave they all were. It's presented as if Henry V willingly and fully knowingly walked into about against a much bigger French force. Reason why the British won the battle of Agincourt was because of the supremacy of their longbows and the fact that the French completely underestimated them and made some tactical blunders during the battle. I don't really see much of that back in this movie. Also some of the cruelties being committed by the British and the mistakes they made during the campaign are simply not shown or mentioned in the movie really. The movie actually got financed by the British government thinking that it would be a good moral boost for the English citizens and those fighting abroad during WW II. So Shakespeare used as propaganda how odd is that? This is not really something uncommon by the way. 'Old' movies often were very black  white with its themes. So good was being entirely good and bad totally bad. It's also not really something that troubled me too much but by todays standards its too simple and too outdated for the present movie norms.Also for a movie about the 'chronicle history of King Henry V' the story focuses surprisingly little on the aspects of Henry V's life before and also certainly after the battle of Agincourt. The story ends at the peak of his life. But of course thing to blame for that is the movie its source William Shakespeare's play from 1600. It's pretty nice that this is a 1944 movie that got shot entirely in color also much have been one of the reasons for its high budget though. It's actually the first ever Shakespeare movie to be made entirely in color. Still I feel that it would had suited the movie and its story better if it had been done in black  white. It would had suited the acting performances and the historical settings and characters all better.It's not like I hated this movie of course not far from it but I don't want to sound all praising about it either. It's a good movie that however is not without its flaws and perhaps would had been a better one had it been made a decade earlier at the time Laurence Olivier was playing the character on stage already. So not during WW II and not in color.But there is simply no denying it that this is such a well made and handled movie. Olivier did well and came to some creative solutions but by staying as much to the original source as possible despite its undeniable WW II influences. The movie is perhaps at its best during the famous battle but also its dialog provide the movie with some real fireworks. A Shakespeare movie of course always has some amazing and often memorable dialog especially when it remains so faithful to its source as this movie did. It of course also helps that the lines are being delivered by some real fine and capable actors. Laurence Olivier was an actor that simply lived and breathed Shakespeare throughout his career.A mustsee for the fans of Shakespeare.810httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "I have never really considered Henry V to be one of Shakespeare's greatest plays. It lacks the philosophical depth and emotional power of the great tragedies or even of some of the other history plays such as Richard III. It is a play which mythologises an English king whose main achievement was to start an unnecessary war with France. As Shakespeare knew well Agincourt was a great victory in the short term but a futile one in the long term. Henry's early death meant that his great ambition of uniting the French and English crowns was never realised the United Kingdom of England and France remains one of the great mighthavebeens of world history. Moreover modern audiences might have another problem with this play. By modern standards which were not necessarily the standards of either Shakespeare's day or of Henry's the English were the aggressors in the Hundred Years War even by mediaeval standards Henry's claim to the French throne was by no means as clearcut as Shakespeare imagined.Despite these difficulties Henry V has been the subject of two of the greatest cinematic Shakespeare adaptations this one and Kenneth Branagh's version from 1989. One reason is that it contains some of Shakespeare's most magnificent poetry and some of his greatest setpiece speeches mostly put into the mouth of Henry himself. It is therefore a very tempting role for Shakespearean actors especially those who can speak blank verse as naturally as Olivier or Branagh.The two films are very different in style. Branagh's naturalistic film emphasises the bloodshed and squalor of war contrary to what is sometimes thought mediaeval warfare was not necessarily more chivalrous or even less bloody than the modern version. The bloodiest day in British military history when some 26000 were killed was 29th March 1461 the date of the Battle of Towton during the Wars of the Roses. Olivier's film is highly stylised rather than naturalistic. The scenes set in England are presented as a reenactment of how the play might have been performed at the Globe theatre during Shakespeare's own lifetime. The French scenes were shot against sets based upon paintings from the early fifteenth century especially the work of the Limbourg brothers. The battle scenes are more realistic but even these play down the elements of blood and cruelty.Olivier's film the first which he directed was commissioned by the British Government as a patriotic moralebooster during the Second World War. The decision to portray war as something glorious rather than bloody was therefore a quite deliberate one. A sharp contrast is drawn between the heroic Henry and his French counterparts. Those parts of Shakespeare's play which show Henry in a less favourable light such as his order to kill the French prisoners are omitted apparently on the instructions of Churchill who did not want the film's patriotic message to be clouded by moral ambiguities. The French King Charles VI is portrayed as a senile old fool and his son the Dauphin Louis as not only an arrogant popinjay but also a sadistic brute who slaughters noncombatants such as the young boys in the English baggage train. Stress is placed on those scenes which show the English Scottish Welsh and Irish captains fighting together against a common enemy. Shakespeare was probably looking ahead to the unification of the English and Scottish crowns under James I and VI which was to take place a few years after his play was written it is perhaps no accident that the Scottish captain is called Jamie.Of the two films I would marginally prefer Branagh's which seems more relevant to a modern audience. Yet there is much about the earlier film which is of value even today. Some of the supporting performances are very good especially from Harcourt Williams as the mad old Charles Max Adrian as the Dauphin and Leslie Banks as the Chorus who speaks some of the most poetic speeches not given to Henry. This is one of the few British films of the early forties shot in colour and the colours are particularly vivid and jewellike making the film far more visually spectacular than Branagh's. Above all this film gives the chance to later generations to see one of Britain's finest classical actors at the peak of his powers taking the leading role in a Shakespearean drama. 810".

	onyx:emotionText "I have never really considered Henry V to be one of Shakespeare's greatest plays. It lacks the philosophical depth and emotional power of the great tragedies or even of some of the other history plays such as Richard III. It is a play which mythologises an English king whose main achievement was to start an unnecessary war with France. As Shakespeare knew well Agincourt was a great victory in the short term but a futile one in the long term. Henry's early death meant that his great ambition of uniting the French and English crowns was never realised the United Kingdom of England and France remains one of the great mighthavebeens of world history. Moreover modern audiences might have another problem with this play. By modern standards which were not necessarily the standards of either Shakespeare's day or of Henry's the English were the aggressors in the Hundred Years War even by mediaeval standards Henry's claim to the French throne was by no means as clearcut as Shakespeare imagined.Despite these difficulties Henry V has been the subject of two of the greatest cinematic Shakespeare adaptations this one and Kenneth Branagh's version from 1989. One reason is that it contains some of Shakespeare's most magnificent poetry and some of his greatest setpiece speeches mostly put into the mouth of Henry himself. It is therefore a very tempting role for Shakespearean actors especially those who can speak blank verse as naturally as Olivier or Branagh.The two films are very different in style. Branagh's naturalistic film emphasises the bloodshed and squalor of war contrary to what is sometimes thought mediaeval warfare was not necessarily more chivalrous or even less bloody than the modern version. The bloodiest day in British military history when some 26000 were killed was 29th March 1461 the date of the Battle of Towton during the Wars of the Roses. Olivier's film is highly stylised rather than naturalistic. The scenes set in England are presented as a reenactment of how the play might have been performed at the Globe theatre during Shakespeare's own lifetime. The French scenes were shot against sets based upon paintings from the early fifteenth century especially the work of the Limbourg brothers. The battle scenes are more realistic but even these play down the elements of blood and cruelty.Olivier's film the first which he directed was commissioned by the British Government as a patriotic moralebooster during the Second World War.

	schema:reviewBody "The term that comes to me most easily when describing Laurence Olivier is 'beautiful' he is unquestionably beautifullymade both in feature and in body and his voice is an instrument of controlled and flexible beauty coupled to a face capable of eloquent and delicate precision  to the degree that I could easily award him my favourite accolade and say in this respect that he could have been a silent actor. In fact the technique in his Shakespearian films that I have most actively admired is that of the soliloquy in voiceover sounds and thoughts alike at their most expressive without the distracting mechanics of their production.And yet... and yet there is so often this and yet. Even in the screen performances that are remarkable  for by no means every one of them is great or even good  I keep finding myself watching not the narrative but the famous Olivier not the character but the proficiency of the technique. And somehow he seems to miss out on the charisma the spark of human connection that a screen stalwart like Leo Genn can bring to a role without headline billing only for a dawning realisation when the credits roll  'so that's why such a minor character stood out'... All too often in these films Olivier seems to be enacting the story opposite the other players rather than entering with them into the actual tale. It's unexpected from one who was renowned on stage precisely for his ability to lose himself in his role.Henry V was one of the films in this Olivier season that I found more than merely a curiosity precisely because there are a number of sections where for me the story does take over where King Harry becomes a character I care about rather than a piece of acting in the abstract. All the same I was unable to lose myself in it entirely Olivier in declamatory mode Once more unto the breach St Crispin's day is the Great Shakespearian but not part of the film in the way of Harry moving quietly among his men at night or charming his princess into their dynastic match in false French and broken English. Some of these more intimate scenes however are very good indeed. The shot that particularly stays in my mind is the wordless moment on the King's face as his soldiers speak unknowingly of the deaths that will lie at the door of their commander.Perhaps the most distinctive element of this production is the use of the Globe Theatre as a framing device in conjunction and coupled with a quite deliberate deployment of obviously artificial scenery and perspective. From the opening diorama fading in to the 'live' theatre the film blends threedimensional stage sets with location shooting and flat manuscripttype illustrations such that horsemen can leave a forcedperspective castle gate and ride up into a picture or the camera roam seamlessly out from a painted set to a cottage yard by way of rows of vines across the page. The rationale was no doubt wartime economics but the decision to make virtue of necessity and create a deliberately stylised look that echoes  yet is not the same as  the staging at the Globe witness the streetscene at the inn and then the 'real' version of it is one that is more or less unique in my experience and is an inspired choice. Instead of unconvincingly realistic scenery done on the cheap we have an openly imaginary world conjured up as a stage performance starts to come to life. And what a performance...I first saw this film years before I ever attended London's new Globe Theatre rewatching it now the resonance is almost uncanny. When Olivier was filming the Globe project wasn't so much as a gleam in Sam Wanamaker's eye  and yet here it is almost timber for timber as it looked and looks again today with the same rowdy buzz the same instrumental accompaniment the same sellers of seats and snacks and rainwear although nowadays it's cushions and plastic! And when the actors step out onto the thrusting stage or the balcony at the Globe and the groundlings stop munching their nuts and start to groan or applaud the atmosphere is the one we see here. From thatch to tiringchamber it works as it did in Shakespeare's day  speaking most literally of this cockpit this wooden O  and Olivier fifty years in the past evokes that same scene and spirit with an accuracy that delivers a shock of recognition. He couldn't possibly have known other than theoretically but he was right.".

On a pretext Henry and his troops invade France and surround a city. Henry demands that the city be surrendered so that he doesn't have to send his soldiers inside to fight and pillage. Oh please don't make us invade your city and rape your women and smash your babies' brains out against the wall. Please  give up before you make us do this. Show us that you have destroyed your WMDs. Oops. It reminds me of an incident in Philadelphia when a neighbor in his underwear pounded on my door at midnight and begged me to call the police. Three armed robbers had entered his house to loot it. One thief held a knife against my neighbor's throat saying Don't make me do it man. Don't make me do it. The victim lost his goods but got away throat intact. But as Joan Crawford once asked Whom is kidding whom around here? How does Olivier the director and principal handle the production? Pretty well. The movie's the thing you know and he does an extremely good job of managing it. Clearly he's watched a couple of Errol Flynn movies. He has lightly clad men armed only with knives dropping from the branches onto heavily armored French knights. Cf. Robin Hood. He has a shot of a line of French knights and gaily flapping flags advancing towards the English at Agincourt first at a walk then a trot then a gallop. Cf. The Charge of the Light Brigade. But he has some unexpectedly original shots too  a startling brief glimpse of a horse's bared teeth in the midst of battle. Harry was a thumotic and mischievous young kid who heard the chimes at Midnight with his friend Sir John Falstaff. Here he's a king and thrusts Falstaff aside. If you want to see Falstaff in excelsis you must see The Merry Wives of Windsor. That's a pretty lousy thing for anyone to do. I know thee not old man says Henry breaking the man's spirit and his body as well. Harry's claim to the throne of France is bull. In the play it takes up a lot of time ratiocination by bishops who are trying to avoid taxes. Some gobbledygook about the Salic law entitling Henry to the throne of France which had heretofore been either ignored or forgotten. It's all glossed over here with some slapstick comedy as it might as well be since no one can follow it anyway. The French are turned into outright villains  foppish insulting comic a scene of a fully armored French knight being lowered jerkily onto his horse by means of a winch. Oh they're sadists too. They raid Henry's supply camps and butcher the young boys they find there. But there's no denying the impact of the play. You'll get caught up in it. And if you don't know what a Bohemian Henry V was or how close he was to Sir John Falstaff and if the movie's four score and five English dead after Agincourt was an undercount if there ever was one what difference does it make? This is fiction not history.Lawrence Olivier's performance can't go unmentioned though. It's just plain superb. He was a truly great actor and there may never have been a Henry V or a Hamlet that was his equal. Anyway Henry V invades France and marries some highclass babe. The courtship is quickly done and involves some racy punning most of which got by me and left me unscathed. England DID wind up ruling parts of northern France as I remember but not for long after Henry's departure.".
