Being a huge Jim Carrey fan I easily saw how he could morph himself into Seuss' Grinch and make the character his own.  I was not disappointed.  This movie was pure magic.  Carrey is a master at his trade and no one could have played this role to perfection as he did.  There was plenty to enjoy for both adults and children alike and this movie is sure to become a timeless classic for all to enjoy in the years to come.  I already have visions of my young daughter sitting down year after year to watch this remake on video and I undoubtedly will watch with her and laugh as I did the first time I saw it.Clearly this movie has Jim Carrey written all over it and I do not believe that it would have come together without him.  However the supporting cast was charming and entertaining in their own right most notably the adorable Taylor Momsen who was the perfect foil for Carrey's antics.  The set design musical score and costumes all lent their hands to a magical fabulous finished product and I believe all involved can be proud. It is not an easy feat to turn a 22 minute cartoon classic into a full length live action film but Howard has succeeded with flying colours.  For those critics who disagree perhaps it is your hearts that are 2 sizes too small.".

This film is called terrible disgusting and not even funny! Now to that I have one word to say but that word is known as a swear word so I won't say it for such reasons as I MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO WRITE MORE REVIEWS. Anyway this film is a great motion picture and Ron Howard proves he still has a lot more life in him then some question. And so finishes my review on a great and funny film The Grinch 2000".

A young girl from Whoville sets out to befriend the Grinch and help him find his love of Christmas but when it goes wrong early on the Grinch becomes even more rotten and plans to ruin it for everyone.I have never read the book or seen the original animated version of this story but I do enjoy a bit of Dr Seuss and was worried about how such imagination would be filled out on the screen.  The film actually manages it very well and the whole film has the look of the books even if it lacks soul at times.  The plot is stretched out to the running time and could have easily been shorter and punchier but at heart it is a good little moral that is good from Christmas time.However aside from the look of the film the main reason that the film works is Jim Carrey.  I cannot think of another actor who could have pulled off this role as well as he did.  He is manic and really funny although I imagine that if you dislike him and his antics that you'd hate the film totally.  I'm on the fence about him but I did enjoy him here.  Momsen is OK but really just a cute kid' and while the support cast has quite a few famous faces they don't make much of an impact under the makeup and the film is left to Carrey to save it  which he happily does.Overall this film is a little too long and padded out but while Carrey is onscreen it seems to go pretty fast due to his hyper acting and comedy antics.  However it's Christmas and it has a nice message while not totally giving in to syrupy sentiment thanks again to manic Carrey and it's just perfect for kids and adults at Christmas time.".

It is basically an adaptation of the famous children's books and what the audience gets is a pleasant Christmas treat. Price's screenplay is brilliant as he cleverly manages to include some adult humour.The world of Whoville is beautifully constructed and created full of colour life energy and spirit. The vivacious characters are full of positive energy and while it is over the top it is all done within the context and none of it appears out of place. The CGI team and makeup crew deserve full credit for making the characters and settings so lifelike bringing out a lot of detail and appearing authentic. The set designs are stunning and the cinematography is just as energetic as the characters.Child actress Taylor Momsen is absolutely. The cute dog also turns in a fine performance. Jeffrey Tambor a very sexy Christine Baranski Bill Irwin and Molly Shannon are first rate. However what would 'How the Grinch Stole Christmas' be without Jim Carrey? Carrey is simply fantastic as he immerses himself entirely into the character. It's a role that has Jim Carrey written all over it. The actor has immortalized the Grinch on screen.The movie itself is not an exact 100 adaptation of the book as there are a few changes. The romance between the Grinch and Martha May could have been better developed. Other than the actors mentioned above the rest of the cast hardly have anything to do than make fleeting appearances. Yet 'How the Grinch Stole Christmas' is a charming little Christmas family film that is dazzling to look at and hugely enjoyable with the whole family.".

I saw the movies and owned the books as a kid and was given the books as a present in my 30's by my friend Amy Fidler. I loved the original movie so it made it hard at first to accept the remake but honestly it has been well done. Jim Carrey is amazing and all of the other players rocked it. The original movie has innuendos of the character traits of the stars however the new movie allows for much more castcharacter depth and development. I have to admit there's one scary scene here with the two main characters however I think you have to really let yourself go in order to experience the thrill. Bought it on the Playstation Network can't wait to own it on Bluray. Narrater rocked it too.".

	schema:reviewBody "I agree completely this film looks extremely overblown and it is.Though the sets and costumes are visually amazing they go by too fast too be truly appreciated and there is the feeling that it is too much crammed into too little.  Besides this the supporting cast have very little to do and the presence of Anthony Hopkins as the narrator is rather puzzling.  Besides that several weak story points are added for instance like the romance between the Grinch and Martha May seems completely superfluous.  However if you want to see this movie see for Jim Carrey who steals the show as the title role.  He is simply hilarious!  He does however run a close race against Cindy Lou Who who is unbelievably cute.The difference between this movie and the cartoon is that this movie is set more from the point of view of the Grinch.  In the cartoon the Grinch is the villain a grumpy old hermit who is jealous of the Whos and their happiness.  The Whos in the cartoon are just simple country townsfolk celebrating Christmas and when the Grinch finds he cannot destroy Christmas he knows he cannot make them suffer the absence he feels in his life and finally understands the holiday spirit. In the movie however the Grinch is a slightly more modern take on his character.  Actually you can't blame him for wanting to do something about the Whos who in this movie are a grim reflection of our society and the crass consumerism and capitalism that yearly chokes the true meaning of the holiday spirit for material possessions.  The Whos are so immersed in their own greed that it almost seems they deserve it when the Grinch drops the ball on them.  The writers also make them seem as irritating and overly cheerful and loud as possible with their gaudy decorations and foods and creepy sugarcoated style.  Cindy Lou's reaction to this is our own and she and the Grinch find the real meaning of the holiday.  She and the Grinch are better seen as role models to today's holiday company as a message not to lose ourselves in our own material greed that has become common to this holiday but to instead remember what Christmas is.  I think this holiday would get a much better reputation if people made it a routine to imagine a Christmas without presents or trimmings every year just to keep that image in mind.  But if you don't want to be annoyed by the Whos or blinded by the slightly overdone sets and costumes watch it for Cindy Lou or if you don't like 'cute' movies like me but like Jim Carrey's raunchy slapstick Marx Bros. style comedy watch it for him.".

This one however has a few tweaks that weren't included in the book. It details the Grinch's past about him being humiliated by the children of Whoville and has a relationship with Martha May Whovier. It wasn't the best origin but wasn't that bad at all. While this movie stayed true to the spirit of the book and despite it's crude and inappropriate humor but has a few good jokes Jim Carrey although overthetop did a perfect job as the Grinch. The rest of the cast did great especially Taylor Madsen as the lovable Cindy LouWho.I show some empathy for fans of the book who hated this adaptation but as for me I'm recommending this Christmas classic to others highly.Rating 8.310".

He turned them down insisting that no one could do better than the marvelous Chuck Jones TV special from 1966 also in mind perhaps was his bitter experience writing the script to 1953's The 5000 Fingers of Dr. T. When the good Dr. died in 1991 his widow Audrey Geisel still obstinately refused to sell the movie rights. But with the commonplace use of CGI effects becoming a reality Mrs. Geisel had a change of heart. Universal made her a generous offer she accepted she also accepted the casting of Jim Carrey as the title character. Supposedly she was satisfied with the final result. Well Mrs. Geisel that makes one of us.The film was given a 123000000 budget which is more than even Heaven's Gate cost including the adjustment for inflation which obviously went towards the very elaborate makeup set design and special effects which are underminedsomewhat by the rather hazy cinematography. Unfortunately it seems that none of that money was set aside to get a better script than what Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman scribes of Who Framed Roger Rabbit? which made much betteruse of a high budget turned in. Whereas the TV special was a trim 26 minutes without commercials this film tries to fill a running time of 105 minutes with more background information about the Grinch. It turns out that as a child he was the subject of ridicule including an especially humiliating experience one Christmas at the age of eight. So it turns out that everything that ails our poor Mr. Grinch is directly because of the Whos. Trouble is it seems like a rather long 105 minutes with too much dead wood clogging up the story. That might not seem so bad if only the Grinch were a little more...well Grinchy. The character that Dr. Seuss wrote and Chuck Jones later animated was a sly fox whose slick attempts to hijack the holiday season were undermined by his sudden change and exponential growth of heart. Carrey's Grinch is a loud hyperactive oaf and at times a thug who when made the holiday Cheermeister' trashes the Whoville town square in angerhopefully the scenery tasted as good as it looked. This undermines the script's attempt to make the Grinch more sympathetic with all the Whos down in Whoville so unsympathetic at least in this interpretation.The Whoville of Dr. Seuss's vision was a small town populated by honest folk who knew in their hearts the true meaning of Christmas. The Whoville of the movie is a rather noisy and crowded place populated by spoiled selfish materialistic ninnies an obvious attempt to comment on American consumerism. This is offensivelyhypocritical inasmuch as the film industry has benefitted greatly from American consumerism and as this film contributed to it with a huge merchandisingcampaign.The film also expands and redefines the character of Cindy Lou Who a small but crucial character in the original. The innocent twoyearold waif who walked in on this spurious Santa is now older and wiser constantly questioning the false values of the Whos and trying to understand the Grinch's point of view her one major scene from the original is reenacted making it seem out of character. Sheseems to be the only one who would ever know that Christmas is more than just gifts and decorations thus making her a completely different and more annoying character.Those who celebrate Christmas should sooner accept a lump of coal in theirstockings on the morning of December 25 than a copy of this overlong overacted excruciatingly tedious hamhanded crude attempt to turn the children's classic into a feature film. It proves once and for all that darkness vulgaritymanipulation and heavyhandedness are inadequate substitutes for charm wit sincerity and heart. The folks at Universal should get down on their collective knees and thank God that this truly bilious 123 million stink bomb grossed 260 million domestically or they'd not be here today. Furthermore it made Mike Myers' The Cat in the Hat possible!".

	schema:reviewBody "How the Grinch Stole Christmas was a wonderful little Christmas cartoon that anyone could easily enjoy I never did see the reason for a remake. Not to mention a remake that was made with humans the cartoon was just perfect enough what's the purpose of this film? But it also seemed a little odd for Jim Carrey to be the Grinch. I mean he's a great comedic actor but him as the Grinch? It just didn't make any sense to me. His performance was a little over the top and unintentionally laughable at moments. Not to mention some of the added dialog was a bit childish and not enjoyable. The whole story of the Grinch and Cindy LouWho was over done and wasn't needed. They actually just destroyed the story period.All the who's in Whoville are getting ready for their best Christmas season yet where everything is intended to go perfectly. But Cindy LouWho is curious and worried about the Grinch that lives above them and that he's not going to get as good of a Christmas as the other who's.

But soon he realizes that the who's may know that it's a little bit more than what is the materialized version of Christmas.How the Grinch Stole Christmas wasn't needed and was a bit over the top. I really recommend that you stick with the cartoon just for the simple fact that this is a pretty disturbing version at least in my opinion. The make up and presentation of the whole film was just a bit over done not to mention that How the Grinch Stole Christmas! was more meant to be as a cartoon rather than a version starring Jim Carry. But at least this version makes you grateful for the Boris Karloff version that is played every Christmas.110".

	onyx:emotionText "How the Grinch Stole Christmas was a wonderful little Christmas cartoon that anyone could easily enjoy I never did see the reason for a remake. Not to mention a remake that was made with humans the cartoon was just perfect enough what's the purpose of this film? But it also seemed a little odd for Jim Carrey to be the Grinch. I mean he's a great comedic actor but him as the Grinch? It just didn't make any sense to me. His performance was a little over the top and unintentionally laughable at moments. Not to mention some of the added dialog was a bit childish and not enjoyable. The whole story of the Grinch and Cindy LouWho was over done and wasn't needed. They actually just destroyed the story period.All the who's in Whoville are getting ready for their best Christmas season yet where everything is intended to go perfectly. But Cindy LouWho is curious and worried about the Grinch that lives above them and that he's not going to get as good of a Christmas as the other who's. He kicks her out and decides that he doesn't want Christmas this year and that in fact he should just steal Christmas all together to show the who's what his version of Christmas is all about. But soon he realizes that the who's may know that it's a little bit more than what is the materialized version of Christmas.How the Grinch Stole Christmas wasn't needed and was a bit over the top.

You can't compare it to the original any more  than you can compare Scrooge to the eternal Dickens classic.  It has a life of its own.  Jim Carrey was amazing.   How he can deliver so many feelings and emotions behind 10 pounds of latex is fantastic.  Some of his scenes obviously impromptu were so funny I nearly wet myself.  The sets were great and not nearly as overblown as I had expected.  As for the  prequel portion well it was only soso. The best part of the whole show is when they sing the Ah hoo torres song at the end which has ALWAYS been my most favorite Christmas song ever.I recommend the movie highly to kids and adults.

Director Ron Howard and his artists have really captured the visual essence of the classic show and one couldn't possibly hope for a betterlooking movie based upon a Seuss story. Jim Carrey is marvelously cast as the Grinch a green furry Christmashating malcontent who lives atop a snowy hill overlooking Whoville although the inhabitants of Whoville present a problem. With makeup designs causing everyone to resemble relatives of Wallace Shawn distinctive or likable personalities were apparently difficult to come by. In expanding this whole scenario screenwriters Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman were unable to retain the angelic some may argue cloying passivity in Whoville. We now get a Mayor who's a selfserving jerk a Christmas lights contest between neighbors and children who laugh and jeer at a moppet version of the Grinch in a very odd flashback sequence. Howard's attentions as a filmmaker begin to wander after a promising opening he becomes exhausted by the material itselfthe bombast wears him outperhaps causing a few of his quieter moments to flag particularly an awful sequence with Carrey having fun with his echo later munching on shattered glass. Bits and pieces work crazy magic though Howard is no Tim Burton and doesn't always grasp the deliciousness in the macabre undermining he's too anxious to be funny. Anthony Hopkins narrates in commendable fashion and there are some marvelous scenes but interest for adults should wane after the first hour.  from ".

In expanding this whole scenario screenwriters Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman were unable to retain the angelic some may argue cloying passivity in Whoville. We now get a Mayor who's a selfserving jerk a Christmas lights contest between neighbors and children who laugh and jeer at a moppet version of the Grinch in a very odd flashback sequence. Howard's attentions as a filmmaker begin to wander after a promising opening he becomes exhausted by the material itselfthe bombast wears him outperhaps causing a few of his quieter moments to flag particularly an awful sequence with Carrey having fun with his echo later munching on shattered glass. Bits and pieces work crazy magic though Howard is no Tim Burton and doesn't always grasp the deliciousness in the macabre undermining he's too anxious to be funny. Anthony Hopkins narrates in commendable fashion and there are some marvelous scenes but interest for adults should wane after the first hour.  from ";

In a very demanding role Jenna tries hard to act troubled or terrorized and even gets to have a big crying scene but any subtleties that might have brought the character to life were well beyond her grasp at this stage of her career. Sexually she fares somewhat better in a fetishthemed fantasy with T.T. Boy that's still a far cry from the barnburner they shared in Michael Zen's brilliant BLUE MOVIE and a heated Sapphic toilet grope with massively mammaried Brittany Andrews. The flick's supposed center piece ironically doesn't even involve its star though as a group sequence apparently dreamed up by Mickey G.'s character unfolds alongside a big shiny fire truck a prop directorcostar Brad Armstrong  aka Jenna's then husband Rod Hopkins  was clearly enamored of as he keeps panning back to it even while the cast's in midstroke ! Certainly looks like someone had his priorities mixed up here. Hopkins is generally considered one of the best filmmakers the adult industry currently has to offer. In the case of his near masterpiece EUPHORIA I'm likely to agree with that evaluation but he's clearly an unrepentant production value junkie as this and several of his other glossy yet tepid efforts like CONQUEST and ANCIENT SECRETS OF THE KAMA SUTRA testify.

	schema:headline " See Jenna in her prime!";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a good porno with the smoking hot Jenna Jameson in her prime. When this was filmed Jenna was porno hot. She still had her voluptuous body that I always loved. Not like now when she's really skinny. This was also back when she didn't have all her tattoos and to me a woman is more sexy if she doesn't have a lot of tattoos. Although I have always loved the heartbreaker on her ass.In this movie Jenna plays a firefighter and the hot action in this movie revolves around the firefighters lives. The story in this porno is bad like in 999  of all porno movies with a story. But the sex scenes are really hot and that is all that matters.We get to see Jenna in three different scenes in this one. Two of them are boy girl scenes and one is a lesbian scene. The first boy girl scene with her isn't a good scene. It's filmed from an angle that makes Jenna look kind of fat and it lacks the intensity. However the second boy girl scene with Jenna is much better. This is a dream scene that takes place in Jenna's head. In this scene Jenna looks incredibly hot and the scene is really intense. Jenna is also really loud in this scene and I must say that it makes me very horny just to hear her moan. In my opinion Jenna has one of the best moans in the industry. The last scene with Jenna is a lesbian scene with Brittany Andrews that takes place in a bathroom. This scene is one of my all time favorite lesbian scenes. Both girls give a good performance in this scene and you can really tell that these girls enjoy licking pussy.From the other scenes in the movie that didn't involve Jenna I really liked the scene with Asia Carrera and Sydnee Steele. In this scene Asia and Sydnee reward two lucky firemen who saved Sydnees life earlier in the movie. The other group sex scene however was kind of a letdown. It was destroyed by horrible music that played during the scene and you couldn't hear the girls moan. Too bad that this movie was made in 1998. Besides the poor quality of the picture there also wasn't any double penetration during the group sex scenes. If this was made today we would have seen many of the girls DPed and the picture would have been first class. All in all I really recommend this movie to all fans of Jenna Jameson.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is a good porno with the smoking hot Jenna Jameson in her prime. When this was filmed Jenna was porno hot. She still had her voluptuous body that I always loved. Not like now when she's really skinny. This was also back when she didn't have all her tattoos and to me a woman is more sexy if she doesn't have a lot of tattoos. Although I have always loved the heartbreaker on her ass.In this movie Jenna plays a firefighter and the hot action in this movie revolves around the firefighters lives. The story in this porno is bad like in 999  of all porno movies with a story. But the sex scenes are really hot and that is all that matters.We get to see Jenna in three different scenes in this one. Two of them are boy girl scenes and one is a lesbian scene. The first boy girl scene with her isn't a good scene. It's filmed from an angle that makes Jenna look kind of fat and it lacks the intensity. However the second boy girl scene with Jenna is much better. This is a dream scene that takes place in Jenna's head. In this scene Jenna looks incredibly hot and the scene is really intense. Jenna is also really loud in this scene and I must say that it makes me very horny just to hear her moan. In my opinion Jenna has one of the best moans in the industry. The last scene with Jenna is a lesbian scene with Brittany Andrews that takes place in a bathroom. This scene is one of my all time favorite lesbian scenes. Both girls give a good performance in this scene and you can really tell that these girls enjoy licking pussy.From the other scenes in the movie that didn't involve Jenna I really liked the scene with Asia Carrera and Sydnee Steele. In this scene Asia and Sydnee reward two lucky firemen who saved Sydnees life earlier in the movie. The other group sex scene however was kind of a letdown. It was destroyed by horrible music that played during the scene and you couldn't hear the girls moan. Too bad that this movie was made in 1998. Besides the poor quality of the picture there also wasn't any double penetration during the group sex scenes. If this was made today we would have seen many of the girls DPed and the picture would have been first class. All in all I really recommend this movie to all fans of Jenna Jameson.";

I am almost sure that there was no script they just went along as they shot it. The two main characters were just plain unlikable. The CGI or the blue screen to fit the actors in the matches was extremely bad and low budget.There was hardly any football in the movie. It was more like the story about the love life of two footballers. There was no build up or character development. The lines and the acting was awful. Santiago Munez the wonder kid suddenly becomes an average midtable club player.Finally the ending oh the ending it was disgusting and worse. If any of you value your time and most importantly money then please do not watch this movie. And this is not a Goal movie. They just used the franchise name to sell some DVD's.".

	schema:headline " What happened to the munez story ?";
	schema:reviewBody "I went into this film thinking that it would carry on from the first 2 goal films and be about the story of the brilliant mexian footballer santiago munez reaching the ultimate dream of playing in the world cup. Unfortunately he played very little part in this film. Not even kicking a ball in the world cup. This is hard to understand considering the first two movies were about him. Overall I thought the script for this movie was terrible compared to the first two which I enjoyed. There were so many times in which the story here just did not relate to what was seen in the first two movies and you ended up asking yourself  hold on what about munez wife or  who is he I have never seen him before etc etc and you never really get a full explanation to these questions. There are some parts which are completely absurd for instance adams gets a taxi to see an ex girlfriend he goes to pay the taxi driver and the taxi drivers says no it alright mate its for free. Adams says great I'll sort you out for tickets to see england in the world cup after the knockout stage. This sounds a reasonable thing to do. However you see the taxi driver and his friends 1 get into the VIP areas of the world cup games 2invited to Braithwaite funeral 3 invited to adams wedding. I mean come it was a free taxi ride for god sake and suddenly your best man at the wedding. All in all I found the story boring and had no relation to the first two movies. The writers for this movie should be ashamed that they strayed so far away from the munez story of the first two movies. So my advice is if you think goal 3 will be anything like the first two movies then you will be bitterly disappointed as I was. With a script this bad It is no wonder some of the actors who played big parts in Goal 1 and 2 did not sign up for Goal 3. Verdit  miss at all costs".

I'M not a fan of soccer and I have to say that the first two movies were great maybe in the top 5 sport movies ever made. This one major flop! It doesn't even tie in with the other ones. For a trilogy to end like this with characters we don't care about with Munz not even a major character here is just bad. I mean where's Harris? Where's Fry? the two new characters here Adams and Braithwaite just pop out of nowhere. And the action is bad.. very bad... Not one scene where you could believe they where really out there playing for real. The first two movies you actually wondered if they filmed the scenes during the freaking games since they seemed so real! I loved it! I was hoping for the same quality here didn't get it at all. I'm guessing the money ran out or just a very bad Director in Morahan. Also I guess that Butchart was the real writer here because the story in Goal 3 is lame.. very lame. Jefferies either got rid of this one in a few hours or he's just that bad. There's no soccer issue other than the drinking oh wow.. If you loved the first two then don't watch this one you'll be greatly disappointed. They took the soul of the 1 and 2 out. Gave Munz a backseat and got rid of the rest of the cast. Even his line that lets us know about his relationship was what can be called some of the worst writing ever! Bad choice. We wanted an end to the story arc. They gave us a shitty conclusion to what seemed like a great continuity. Too bad. 1 star..".

I've seen many wonderful films during this time but not one has meant as much as this one to me. This is an atrocious film. Full of stereotypical characters boring plot little integration between the actors and real football footage which was a strength in earlier versions. Furthermore it doesn't appear to fit in at all with the two earlier parts of this trilogy as the main character Santiago is relegated to a supporting role and none of the people around him from the earlier parts have survived. You have a completely pointless set of Geordie fans which I guess were introduced to try and inject some humour to the tired plot. The acting is pitiful the script is criminal and it was almost so bad I could have watched it all over again just to laugh at the total ineptitude. I awarded this film 1  a first for me and I consider I was being far too generous.".

The movie started with 78 user rating on IMDb which I believe were production people votes family etc...One of the comments which really struck me was If you thought the movie sucked that bad...why don't you shell out the cash and make one better...if you can't afford it then keep your mouth shut...We do it by buying the DVD and paying for theater tickets but please understand that we feel sad and extremely disappointed when film makers sorta pocket our money with jokes like this movie.A similar experience I had was Rocky 5 but Sylvester Stallone was man enough to say sorry to the fans and actually accepted that the movie was bad but than he made Rocky 6 Rocky Balboa which was an epic ending in my opinion.So just like The Rocky Story was saved Goal can be saved with a real 3rd installation. However it will require producers who love the movie as much as the fans love it.

The story line was pathetic the acting was rubbish and even the computer effects were so obvious that it looked fake I probably could have done better with a home camera and some expensive software to edit the clips.What really gets to me is that I had collected the first two in anticipation of completing the trilogy.I guess that will never happen as I honestly wouldn't call this Goal 3 Honestly whoever wrote the story line lost the plot and really wasted my time and other people's money in this movie if this movie had made the cinema I would have asked for my money back.Please take this movie off the market and make a proper ending to the trilogy that it so much deserves and with the original cast members that gave the original 2 Goal movies it's heart and soul".

I don't even know what to say.But again all of the Goal! movies part one and two were about Santiago. And this is not.

Where was Roz and the baby Glen Foy and Gavin Harris? I can understand that they might not have the budget to star the likes of Anna Friel or Stephen Dillane again but they could have just gotten new actoractresses.

All equipment and vehicles used are used correctly whilst dialogue and radio chatter inside of combat shows detail that inexperienced eyes might miss. However acting is not something these Seals train for at basic! Dialogue outside of combat is weak at best and any scene trying to get some form of emotion out of the audience is lost as soon as one opens their mouth. Not many good things can be said about the story line. A rather unimaginative plot coupled with the stereotypical 'bad guy' does little but create a backdrop for the numerous fire fights and special forces insertions. Lastly it should be noted that the film was shot in a noticeable High Definition that creates specular grandeur on wide pan shots.Those looking for a well constructed war film should look else where. The predicable storyline and patriotic American stance will put most viewers off. However if HD fire fights good military realism can be taken with a pinch of salt this film does not disappoint.".

	schema:headline " What can I say Excellent  Finally!";
	schema:reviewBody "If you are tired of Hollywood action movies that are poorly coordinated and where the directors just guess at everything like I am you are really going to like this movie.Personally I have actively served in the military and the thing that really bothers me is the non realism of military roles that I see in movies. Directors and crew blatantly cut corners hire no nothing actors and extras to portray military roles. Actual direction to the actors and extras that I have heard straight from their lips just to pretend because the audience doesn't know any better and doesn't care. Well WRONG we do care...There are of course directors that DO care for realism such as Ridley Scott  Oliver Stone. Directors that care hire people like Dale Dye or equivalent to produce such realism. It is a very hard thing to do when the sides or script simply say insert tech talk or insert military maneuver and your movie doesn't even have the technical adviser.For someone who has been there and done that it is excruciating to see actors do everything wrong shoulder rifles wrong and hear stupid and unrealistic dialog. Since my service ended I have been working in film and TV myself to somewhat try and make a difference in this manner.This movie may not have Oscar winning acting but it gave me a true chilling effect of realism. Some say they were not real active duty. Well I can't vouch for that but what I can tell you is that everything they did and said were extremely accurate and I have little problem in doubting that statement. Seeview the film as you want some will see it as propaganda... Well anyone showing pride in something is going to show everything at it's best and only the people who have never been there will confuse pride with propaganda.

Sure others will see this film as a recruitment tool. Sure and again when pride is shown in a cool way of course the young may choose a career in the military. The same being said with movies with doctors firemen or policemen.See this movie as a statement to reality in a technical way pay attention to how things are spoken how weapons are suppose to be used held fired and reloaded on the fly. When you use real military there is an automatic understanding of positioning. I understand that Hollywood need to be in there to actually film things and understand the need to make changes to do so but I could not find very much wrong with what I did see. To mention live rounds... this is unheard of in film just because of the danger level and would never be accepted in civilian North America. That is why the movie was shot where it was and on live fire ranges. I am impressed.I very much liked it and the portrayal of the soldier. I felt pride technically things were accurate and as they should be. Good Job!".

	onyx:emotionText "If you are tired of Hollywood action movies that are poorly coordinated and where the directors just guess at everything like I am you are really going to like this movie.Personally I have actively served in the military and the thing that really bothers me is the non realism of military roles that I see in movies. Directors and crew blatantly cut corners hire no nothing actors and extras to portray military roles. Actual direction to the actors and extras that I have heard straight from their lips just to pretend because the audience doesn't know any better and doesn't care. Well WRONG we do care...There are of course directors that DO care for realism such as Ridley Scott  Oliver Stone. Directors that care hire people like Dale Dye or equivalent to produce such realism. It is a very hard thing to do when the sides or script simply say insert tech talk or insert military maneuver and your movie doesn't even have the technical adviser.For someone who has been there and done that it is excruciating to see actors do everything wrong shoulder rifles wrong and hear stupid and unrealistic dialog. Since my service ended I have been working in film and TV myself to somewhat try and make a difference in this manner.This movie may not have Oscar winning acting but it gave me a true chilling effect of realism. Some say they were not real active duty. Well I can't vouch for that but what I can tell you is that everything they did and said were extremely accurate and I have little problem in doubting that statement. Seeview the film as you want some will see it as propaganda... Well anyone showing pride in something is going to show everything at it's best and only the people who have never been there will confuse pride with propaganda.

What little is lost in the SEALs' lack of acting chops is more than made up for by honest performances from the men who actually do this stuff for a living and the film's gripping battle realism. The movie sidesteps an overt political point of view wisely focusing on the men and their mission rather than commenting on the times in which they serve. Watch for a great scene where Navy swift boats extract the SEALs from a Central American jungle with an astonishing display of live fire. Plenty of battle action to see here that you've never seen before. Highly recommended.".

	schema:headline " Call of Duty The Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "If you've ever wanted to know what Call of Duty The Movie would be like then look no further than Act of Valor the action packed war film featuring active duty Navy Seals as some of the main characters. It's the story of a team of Seals who go on a covert mission to rescue a kidnapped CIA agent from terrorists. It's an extremely patriotic love letter to the armed forces a film that shows undying respect for these brave men and women romanticizing their valiant efforts overseas. It feels more like a recruitment video than a film and I think it might have been better off as one instead.Act of Valor is a film that wants to be intense super cool and also profound. However it's profundities are incredibly shallow and all of the observations the film makes on war are nothing new and provide no new insight into war. But as far as intense and super cool goes Act of Valor accomplishes that more than anything else. It's one giant firefight after another exemplifying the blaze of glory that the Seals fight within. It's a finely polished and explosively grand picture of modern warfare.But if you're looking for any kind of story characters or halfway decent dialogue then Act of Valor is not what you want. I said before that the film stars actual Navy Seals so it should be expected that the acting will be dreadful... and it is. But I can easily forgive this. However what I can't forgive is the paper thin story that is devoid of all substance as well as the pathetically dry dialogue. The script is beyond awful with incredibly cheesy and lifeless dialogue and a terribly empty story that most certainly perhaps even deliberately takes a back seat to the visual spectacle aspect of Act of Valor.All in all the story is practically nonexistent here and the only thing this film has going for it is it's patriotism and firefights. But even the fighting gets a little tedious with it's overuse of the shaky cam and first person video game style camera work that gets overused to the point where it's almost gimmicky. I won't deny that Act of Valor is pretty cool and it certainly makes one proud to be an American but I cannot say that it's a good film. It's a definite dud and there is little point in seeing this film especially if you value story characters and dialogue.".

Are there no other SEAL teams due to cut backs ? As with a video game the baddies cannot fire straight but the SEAL team never miss. Got hit by a dud RPG ? Just pull it from your bulletproof vest dust yourself off and walk away. Do not waste your money or time on this film.";

The objective was probably to heighten the realism but c'mon you can't get more Hollywood than this flick. At no point in the movie I got the feeling this was realistic. Every shot the SEALS fire is spot on while terrorists are shooting all over the place. At least show some casualties on both sides and not only the heroic sacrifice of the 'grenadesoldier'.The lack of acting skills was very painful as you get clich after clich and laughable in a bad way jokes in between to lighten things up. The characters were as flat as can be. I can't even remember one guy's name.The story was TERRIBLE. This may be based on real missions but at least come up with a coherent background story or a terrorist plot that's a bit more sophisticated the explosive terrorist suits really?. On top of that you never got the feeling the bad guys were even close to striking. They never even got into the tunnel as our hero who is shot about 73 times is still capable to gun down the last remaining bad guy. So the threat didn't even seem imminent.I don't want to play down the job these guy do but sorry this was just a bad propaganda fairy tale.".

	schema:headline " Brilliantly directed adequately acted and poorly written.";
	schema:reviewBody "I decided to give Act of Valor a watch after reading some of the reviews on here. I was fully aware that the main cast were not professional actors and was prepared for the occasional wooden performance. In fairness to the cast I felt that the acting was perfectly adequate for the genre and even exceeded at times performances by the likes of Stallone and Schwarzenegger that's not really saying much. I felt that the director did a superb job particularly with the action sequences and that the cinematography was also fantastic I love those DSLR's. Unfortunately the same cannot be said for the writing. I have never heard such poorly written dialogue nor have I ever been witness to such lousy characterization. Here is the sum total of what we came to learn about the 2 leading characters  1 can surf while the other needs practice.  They are both navy seals.  1 has 5 children while the other is expecting his 1st.  They are both very very heroic. If a writer truly wants his or her audience to care about the characters we need to know a little bit about them. They need to feel like real people to us. I can't remember the last time I shed a tear for a caricature. Almost all of the nonaction related dialogue was centered around the Lieutenants anticipation of the birth of his child. The writer clearly felt this was an important plot point as he continually kept referring to it at every possible moment. This not only wasted valuable time which could have been better used to acquaint us with the characters but also made the eventual outcome blatantly obvious. Of course he was going to die!!! They keep referring to it in the hope that we will be sad when it happens. I wasn't sad! Who was that guy???I am not trying to dismiss the courage of Navy Seals. The work they do is incredible. These brave men risk their lives on a daily basis in the noble pursuit of protecting their country. They deserve recognition and gratitude for the amazing work that they do. Unfortunately I felt that this tribute failed to do that justice. What could have been incredibly powerful was sabotaged by poor writing relegating the film to utter mediocrity. Such a shame!".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is some military guy's idea of what a movie should be like. This movie wasn't entertaining. It was tedious. Too many shootouts and chases.You can't replace proper character development with narration by SEALS about how much these SEALS love their families and each other. Sorry but you can't. These familycamaraderie scenes were too awkward and seemed phony to me.If you're going to make glory honour sacrifice etc. the theme of your movie you really have to play it with a light hand. In this movie the moviegoer is bludgeoned to death with it. Every sappy thing you can imagine is thrown at you.There were some really dreadful acting performances in this movie.The dialogue was forced and irritating. Yes is not good enough. It has to be roger that or check. Even you is replaced by your ass. Everyone spoke constantly in an abrupt staccato way as if they couldn't stop doing it. This militarystyle dialogue just felt forced and overdone to me. If the SEALS really talk like this all the time they live in a strange world. I've served in the military and it's not like this.The Christo character confused me. Why would a Russian Jew who spoke such flawless American English be willing to participate in jihadist activities against the US? And how could the same man be considered a local hero in Costa Rica?? I don't require perfect logic and credibility in a movie but these issues made it difficult for me to enjoy the movie.The scene of the amateurish and juvenile interrogation of Christo was just....strange. I found the movie hard to follow at times. I couldn't tell the characters apart at times. When Mikey got hit and everyone was yelling Mikey! Mikey! I was thinking who is Mikey again? The violence in this movie was over the top and gratuitous. Two scenes in particular. However I don't want to say anything more about that because it'll give away what happens. OK we get it. The evil guys are truly evil. No grey. No nuance. Just black and white.This movie presented a world view that I don't recognise. Apparently there are Philippine Muslims willing to act as suicide bombers. Really? Apparently there is an association a vast conspiracy between jihadists and organised criminals in Russia Costa Rica and Mexico. Really?? The open shootouts in Mexico and Costa Rica are just disturbing. I thought these countries were allies of the US. To accept this movie you have to accept that ordinary Costa Ricans and Mexicans even those involved in nefarious activities will do suicidal things in the face of overwhelming American military firepower i.e. put themselves in the line of fire and willingly sacrifice their lives...for what exactly? Their orders? Are the Costa Ricans and Mexicans really that fanatical? To filmmakers with this worldview everyone is a suicidal fanatic.And can the SEALS just go into Mexico and terrorise Mexicans like this in their efforts to protect American interests? That surprised me...Another problem for me started with the use of the word war at the beginning. The US is not really at war is it? But even if it is this does not include the kind of international operation shown in this movie. For these filmmakers the fight against international organised crime has merged into the concept of war. To enjoy this movie you have to accept that the US is involved in a war that entails military operations all over the world. Apparently there are American filmmakers who believe that the US is involved in a universal neverending war with almost everybody.OK the SEAL tactics and military technology were cool.".

This movie shows some of the awesome firepower while staying focused on the Navy SEALs you read and hear about in the news. It humanizes them and short of being there firsthand you get to follow them thru covert ops and see how they are truly heroes. The cinematography is excellent switching between first and thirdperson with gripping realism and keeps you on the edge. It's rated R because of the graphic violence so be prepared. Overall I highly recommend this movie the best so far this year.".

	onyx:emotionText "Wow! Act of Valor was intense. It makes you realize and appreciate our military not just in terms of the might and scope but also the men and women who serve. This movie shows some of the awesome firepower while staying focused on the Navy SEALs you read and hear about in the news. It humanizes them and short of being there firsthand you get to follow them thru covert ops and see how they are truly heroes. The cinematography is excellent switching between first and thirdperson with gripping realism and keeps you on the edge. It's rated R because of the graphic violence so be prepared. Overall I highly recommend this movie the best so far this year.";

People running away from a gunfight are shot in the back!They raid a private yacht again not identifying themselves and killing random unarmed crew members as they go. The acting is weak even for nonactors. But then they aren't given much to work with in terms of a script.If you just want to watch a few very real action scenes and to come away with an increased level of disgust at the way the US throws it's military weight around without any reference to the articles of war then you will love this!!PS IMDb has tried to correct my review because they know how to correctly spell valour. I have retained the poor spelling despite the correction.".

Because of the flat exchange of dialog in the beginning you might get confused trying to figure out if it is a documentary or a scripted movie you are watching. Regardless the cinematography was simply gorgeous and the action was insane. What these warriors can do with their minds and bodies is boggling.

Otherwise it's the worst acting I have come across in some time and the dialogue completely destroys the movie. You simply can't take any of the scenes seriously after one of the SEALs starts talking. I was actually rooting for the terrorists 3 minutes into the movie hoping that they would kill all the SEALs and end my pain.I'm honestly worried about people who enjoy this movie because they clearly don't have the wherewithal to understand what a clich is and why story tellers shouldn't use them. You think anyone cares if real SEALs are used in a movie to enhance the realism? Nope. That's like saying that using real guns in a movie would enhance the realism. Why don't all movies do that? It's absurd. Insert 'The Crow' jokes here Hires the SEALs as advisers and hire some real actors. Worked for Saving Private Ryan. I saw that movie with a WWII vet in the theaters on opening day and he said it looked and sounded exactly like how he remembered.

	schema:reviewBody "Act of Valor proves that soldiers aren't actors and that if you're going to make a movie out of a gimmick you should ensure that someone has the common sense to stop the project before it becomes a colossal waste of time. I can't go into the premise of this movie without informing you of the biggest flaw of the movie the stunts and characters of this film are performed by actual active duty Navy SEALS. That means the lingo tactics and stunts here are real. Too bad none of these guys can act and the story is so paintbynumbers that it becomes dreadfully dull.The film opens with a terrorist named Abu Shabal Jason Cottle blowing up dozens of children and a U.S. ambassador using an icecream truck filled with explosives. Oooooh! I hate him already! In Costa Rica a CIA operative who has been gathering evidence against Shabal's associate Christo Toykovich Alex Veadov is kidnapped by his drugdealing militia. That's when we meet our heroes and by meet I mean they appear on screen and a box containing their stats appears next to their faces. The two main characters are Lieutenant Rorke Rorke Denver who informs us that his wife is pregnant with his first child odds of living through this movie are low! and Chief Dave credited as SOC Dave in the credits. The SEALS learn of a most sinister terrorist plot against the greatest country in the history of time and space the United States of America! The most infuriating thing about this movie is that I know there are going to be tons of people out that that will be suckered into loving this clichridden snoozefest. It's because the movie pulls every trick in the book to trick you into thinking you like this movie. Take Lieutenant Rorke for example. It's not enough that he's a hero literally he has a beautiful wife waiting for him at home and she's pregnant. On top of that his father died saving other soldiers and he now carries that man's flag with him on every mission. I half expected Rorke to tell us that he was retiring after this last mission and that he hoped to reconcile with his son whom he hadn't seen in ten years and the villains to be gay child molesters on top of terrorists and drug dealers.The clich storm is not limited to our heroes this film goes out of its way to throw in cardboard cutouts for our heroes to fight in the form of Generic Brand Bad Guys. We get maybe one antagonist that gets the slightest bit of character development the rest are runofthemill baddies ranging from terrorists to cartel members that are just there to be gunned down by our heroes. The film knowing fully well that it has no real emotional impact whatsoever except maybe if you are yourself a Navy SEAL or you went through some kind of war tries to get around this by dedicating the film to ... warriors of the Naval Special Warfare who have made the ultimate sacrifice since 911 and then by listing all of the names of the men and women who have been killed. I'm up for respecting people who have given up their lives as much as the next person despite not being a redblooded baseballloving resident of America the beautiful but notice how this text comes before the end credits ensuring that unless you walk out early you will feel compelled to sit down and read it. The movie then goes on to play a sad song about giving your life For You by Keith Urban while images of smiling children people holding hands soldiers and civil officers scroll.To the people who thought this movie was emotionally effective I say that had you not seen those last ten minutes which have no bearing on the story whatsoever by the way you would not have liked this movie nearly as much as you claim to. Even if you tried to avoid this montage of emoooootion the movie would still get a legup on you by concluding itself with a sad reading of Live Your Life by Tecumseh.To give the movie credit the action sequences are well done in terms of pyrotechnics intensity realism and special effects. It's enough to jolt you awake in what is unfortunately a dull action movie populated with wooden actors incoherent lingo and an ultrapatriotic tone that tries so hard to get you riled up it becomes a little bit offensive. This was headed pretty quickly for a straight 0  5 for me but thanks to the combat sequences it earns itself a 1  5. It's a terrible movie that I can only recommend if you are yourself an active Navy SEAL you haven't seen a movie in so long you can't remember what acting is like and you are not able to access any warshooter video game movies. On DVD May 9 2014".

After seeing it I can't say it's the funniest movie ever but it definitely isn't the worst.I have not seen the original version but I'm sure there are some modern plot twists and of course original jokes. There are plenty of gags and funny situations that kept me entertained throughout and some really good ones that made me laugh hysterically. Many comedies are very silly which makes them so funny but people have said that this movie is just silly and not funny at all I can't agree. While there are some small parts that are just silly the rest are not.Acting wise it is quite good. Jim Carrey does his trademark craziness well in this one. The rest of the cast do well too.Overall it's a funny entertaining movie. If you feel like a light comedy with some good laughs ignore the harsh critics and go and see it.".

After seeing it I can't say it's the funniest movie ever but it definitely isn't the worst.I have not seen the original version but I'm sure there are some modern plot twists and of course original jokes. There are plenty of gags and funny situations that kept me entertained throughout and some really good ones that made me laugh hysterically. Many comedies are very silly which makes them so funny but people have said that this movie is just silly and not funny at all I can't agree. While there are some small parts that are just silly the rest are not.Acting wise it is quite good. Jim Carrey does his trademark craziness well in this one. The rest of the cast do well too.Overall it's a funny entertaining movie. If you feel like a light comedy with some good laughs ignore the harsh critics and go and see it.";

If you aren't a Carrey fan than this film may not be for you...I was very anxious for this film to come out once I heard it was in production however after I saw a couple of reviews on TV it appeared to be another clichd holiday flick that featured a toned down version of Carrey.I made sure to keep my hopes low for this film just in case Carrey was not in pure form however I was delightfully surprised. Carrey lights up the screen once again with his zany antics and rubberface slapstick comedy. The film by far from my favorite Carrey movie will definitely be added to my collection for not only Carrey's comedic stylings but also for its good acting Baldwin Leoni and message.Although I never did see the original the present day story hits home with current collapses of major corporations such as Enron Worldcom and many others. Although this updated script seemed a bit unfinished it was definitely worth the 6.00 ticket.Te Leoni while at times was a bit hard to swallow made a good match for her high energy movie spouse Jim Carrey. She was able to come up to Carrey's intensity with her constant anxious energy yet throughout most of the movie he out shined her as he does most of his movie costars.Another unmentioned quality that the movie has is its clean content. The cussing is kept to a minimum and there is no graphic or violent content making it a great choice for a family film. My 6yearold niece saw it with me and she was laughing throughout and it kept her attention! Although I did not give the movie a perfect rating mainly due to the script and emphasis on plot I would give this movie 3 out of 4 stars. I would liken the film to Liar Liar with a watered down script. I would definitely check out this one out  you're guaranteed to have Fun with Dick and maybe Jane ".

This is a dream coupling that should be repeated in more light comedies the way William Powell  Myrna Loy were paired in The Thin Man series.I found this remake head and shoulders above the original because it had far more energy and there was more 'sympatico' in the match of personalities of Dick  Jane. The new version also has a much more important message about corporate shenanigans and its grave impact on modern society.

He became a hit actor in the likes of Ace Ventura Pet Detective a personal childhood favourite The Mask and Dumb and Dumber. He tried hard for an Oscar nom but always contended with winning Golden Globes. And for years now he has basically been bouncing around dramas comedies and dramedies. So now he has tackled a remake of a comedy no less and the results as per the last few years are mixed at best.Carrey is Dick an employee at Globodyne read Enron who is promoted just in time to help sail the company into oblivion on television. He tells his wife Jane Tea Leoni to leave her job only hours before hand and upon returning stunning home realizes that he may be in a bit of trouble. As the months go on the pair's assets slowly begin to dwindle and hope for continued survival begins to evaporate. So with nothing left to do they turn to life of petty crime and hope for the best.It is not an original concept at all but Carrey and Leoni do a valiant job keeping this boat floating. While the film does have a few hilarious moments the rest of it is bogged down by mere snickerfilled sequences or just scenes that are totally unfunny. It's not like these two actors are having any trouble being funny it's that the material is not funny. Judd Apatow did wonders with The 40YearOld Virgin but he fumbles here pretty hard with his writing partner Nicholas Stoller who does not have nearly enough credits to his name. A parody on what happened at Enron was inevitable but this just seems lackluster and barely thought out. Subplots are brought in but barely resolved and the key storyline just feels very weak by the end. It's not terrible it just feels a tad bit incomplete.The sorry thing about the entire film is the fact that much of it just feels like an extended montage with little payoff. It is only ninety minutes long so it feels like a lot was trimmed down or cut right out. But the film suffers as a result. If it was longer it undoubtedly could have had more potential for more funny moments and as a whole feel more complete.While Carrey and Leoni do their best it's Leoni who gives a stronger performance. Yes Carrey is right at home with his zany character and totally overshadows Leoni in every single aspect. But he just lacks that integral element of human comedy here that made him so famous in the first place. It's unfortunate and makes me wonder if the old Carrey will ever return or if we'll have to contend with semifunny Carrey for the rest of his career. Leoni is much better and feels more in tune with what she's doing. Even more unfortunate is the wasted supporting cast does very little. Alec Baldwin as the sleazy CEO Jack McCallister is sparingly unfunny as is Richard Jenkins as the right hand man Frank Bascombe who spends most of the movie drunk and not doing anything besides setting up for the finale. The rest of the cast has little to no screen time or are simply silly supporting characters that just feel like excess waste in the entire scheme of things.For all of it's faults the film is a worth while watch. As said I did laugh at some of it. A bit of work on the screenplay would have benefited everyone here. Just do not go in expecting a comedy classic with Jim Carrey. If so you will be sadly disappointed.6.510.".

He tried hard for an Oscar nom but always contended with winning Golden Globes. And for years now he has basically been bouncing around dramas comedies and dramedies. So now he has tackled a remake of a comedy no less and the results as per the last few years are mixed at best.Carrey is Dick an employee at Globodyne read Enron who is promoted just in time to help sail the company into oblivion on television.

And the female costar was so obviously overshadowed by Carrey that she did not have a chance to act. One New Year's resolution came as a result of the wasted time. From now on I will not watch a movie that is not personally recommended by somebody I trust. The trailers for the movie made it seem hilarious. It is not. It is stupid.";

It's almost impossible to live in the US on what most jobs pay. The major problem with this movie is that it was dull and predictable but a minor problem was that there was something insidious about making light of the economic plight of most Americans. Poverty the movie says is about not being able to afford a Mercedes not having a bigscreen plasma TV not having a hot tub. Yes it said this tongueincheek but not really. The premise that things have really gotten bad when upper middle class people have to resort to armed robbery to support their lifestyle somehow manages to say that it's really only the problems of the rich that matter and it ignores what real poverty is like and how common it is now.

	schema:headline " A Modern Masterpiece...";
	schema:reviewBody "DISCLAIMER Not seen 'The Usual Suspects' yet? Then don't waste any time reading this! Rent it buy it borrow it I don't mind but watch it before you bother reading any further.One of the main reasons that 'The Usual Suspects' leaves such a longlasting impression on the viewer is that it takes advantage of the gullibility of the audience. For the first 100 minutes we are delivered an intriguing and complex story to which there seems no easy answer. When the final piece of the puzzle seems to be in place the entire film is turned on its head. This final revelation initially leaves you speechless and then shortly after the audience realises that they have fallen for a brilliantly inspired trick. The second great trick that this film plays on its audience is making us think that by watching it again we'll be able to understand slightly better what was really going on. The truth is that the more you try to make sense of it the more confusing it becomes. It's probably best not to try to look for any concrete answers and just accept that we fell for the filmmaker's tricks. The success of the film is mainly thanks to the sense of satisfaction the audience is left with at the end of the film. I think that people love the idea of a story when you're not sure who you can really trust along with the realisation that the film's most shady characters are the filmmakers themselves.Aside from the twist the film is also unique in the way the narrative is presented. The majority of the story is told as a series of flashbacks by crippled con artist Verbal Kint a performance which deservedly won Kevin Spacey his first Oscar. The film's other Oscar went to screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie who also directed 'The Way of the Gun' 2000 for his brilliantly constructed screenplay. It's a testament to the director Bryan Singer that he was able to combine all these elements and turn them into something which is nothing short of a modern masterpiece. His moody and stylish direction help to bring the film together and perfectly complement the film's dark tone. A mention should also go to John Ottman for his skilful editing and amazing score.The Usual Suspects is more than just a film with a clever ending. It revealed an awful lot about film audiences and showed us that their expectations can be used against them. It is also a film about story telling and the importance of myth. I think that one of the most valuable lessons that filmmakers can learn from The Usual Suspects' is that the more interesting and intriguing your story is the more your audience will believe.The Usual Suspects was certainly not the first film to contain twist ending the twist ending became one of Alfred Hitchcock's trademarks and was certainly not the last 'The Sixth Sense' 1999 also used this technique effectively but left more subtle clues for the audience to pick up on their repeated viewings. Despite this 'The Usual Suspects' remains one of the most innovative and memorable crime thrillers of the nineties.".

	onyx:emotionText "DISCLAIMER Not seen 'The Usual Suspects' yet? Then don't waste any time reading this! Rent it buy it borrow it I don't mind but watch it before you bother reading any further.One of the main reasons that 'The Usual Suspects' leaves such a longlasting impression on the viewer is that it takes advantage of the gullibility of the audience. For the first 100 minutes we are delivered an intriguing and complex story to which there seems no easy answer. When the final piece of the puzzle seems to be in place the entire film is turned on its head. This final revelation initially leaves you speechless and then shortly after the audience realises that they have fallen for a brilliantly inspired trick. The second great trick that this film plays on its audience is making us think that by watching it again we'll be able to understand slightly better what was really going on. The truth is that the more you try to make sense of it the more confusing it becomes. It's probably best not to try to look for any concrete answers and just accept that we fell for the filmmaker's tricks. The success of the film is mainly thanks to the sense of satisfaction the audience is left with at the end of the film. I think that people love the idea of a story when you're not sure who you can really trust along with the realisation that the film's most shady characters are the filmmakers themselves.Aside from the twist the film is also unique in the way the narrative is presented. The majority of the story is told as a series of flashbacks by crippled con artist Verbal Kint a performance which deservedly won Kevin Spacey his first Oscar. The film's other Oscar went to screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie who also directed 'The Way of the Gun' 2000 for his brilliantly constructed screenplay. It's a testament to the director Bryan Singer that he was able to combine all these elements and turn them into something which is nothing short of a modern masterpiece. His moody and stylish direction help to bring the film together and perfectly complement the film's dark tone. A mention should also go to John Ottman for his skilful editing and amazing score.The Usual Suspects is more than just a film with a clever ending. It revealed an awful lot about film audiences and showed us that their expectations can be used against them. It is also a film about story telling and the importance of myth. I think that one of the most valuable lessons that filmmakers can learn from The Usual Suspects' is that the more interesting and intriguing your story is the more your audience will believe.The Usual Suspects was certainly not the first film to contain twist ending the twist ending became one of Alfred Hitchcock's trademarks and was certainly not the last 'The Sixth Sense' 1999 also used this technique effectively but left more subtle clues for the audience to pick up on their repeated viewings.

	schema:headline " the American thriller of the nineties";
	schema:reviewBody "One day in a bookshop I flipped through a book entitled the movies of the nineties and this movie wasn't included! How can a book specialized in cinema skip such a milestone of the last decade? Any movie buff any cinema critic must have considered the nineties a fruitful era for the American thriller. According to one's tastes some will say that the best thriller of the nineties is Silence of the Lambs 1991. For others it will be Pulp Fiction 1994 while others will praise to the skies Se7en 1995. For me the pinnacle is this present movie the Usual Suspects 1995 with its staggering story to put it mildly. It's a sensational debut for Bryan Singer which enabled to put him on the map. With a little help from his accomplice Christopher McQuarrie he signed an unparalleled gem in the landscape of the American thriller even the whole cinema.The average viewer who watches the Usual Suspects for the first time might think that the whole crew concocted him a meandering story with as a leading thread Spacey's convoluted story. At the end of the projection he may feel puzzled and will probably wish to watch the movie a second time. He won't regret it and Singer and McQuarrie will rejoice at it. Their masterwork gains by several repeated viewings to appreciate the subtleties of a rich movie with a convoluted construction which will take its seemingly definitive form in the five last minutes. To watch the Usual Suspects is like gathering the pieces of an intriguing puzzle a little like any other suspenseful movie but in the case of Singer's flick one will never really be able to completely end it. So many things happen in less than two hours that we are never really sure of what we watch and this is reinforced by a breathtaking unexpected twist at the end which makes our assumptions falter. Singer and McQuarrie take a mischievous delight in taking the viewer in their nebulous scenario and to follow it according to Spacey's declarations and it's obvious that they raise more questions than answers. It's up to the viewer to make his imagination work and to bring his thoughts on the film. This is what inspires its pernicious charm.From Spacey's story the authors developed a top quality script set with clockwork precision. Singer's directorial style virtually evolutes on the razor's edge and conveys an increasing tension. It is filled with ingenious visual ideas and served by fluid camera movements. Singer was in his early thirties when he shot his film but it presents the signs of a seasoned author. There's also a tight editing and a unsettling score which cement the movie in its place of winner. More remarkable the authors pull off with gusto to increase the audience's curiosity throughout the film in spite of a somewhat deliberate confusion and the interest won't weaken until the end which constitute the apex an unexpected twist which will leave the audience speechless once they understood it. In Singer's flick it doesn't disappoint because there are little but noticeable visual and verbal clues which justify it. However it has something unsettling. We believe that we are at the end of the maze but there's more to the picture than meets the eye. Maybe this coup de theatre veils one more truth. Maybe also the shrewdest ones will have guessed it but the result is the same for any viewer Singer puts a baffled spectator in his pocket.Singer and Quarrie show a perfect master in the domain of the film noir an ominous atmosphere nocturnal scenes which stay rooted in the mind and a deep psychology of certain characters which give more substance to the film. Considering the last point the character of Gabriel Byrne is the most interesting one a former crooked cop who seemingly redeemed himself in catering but caught up by his past and forced to come back to work. I personally think that Byrne is the standout of the topflight cast the movie boasts. But don't neglect the other members. Kevin Spacey pocketed a deservedly Oscar in 1996 and the rest of the cast doesn't stay on the bench. Maybe Singer grants a little shallow attention to the three others baddies in the gang but in a way it's necessary to underscore the fact that they're lousy gangsters embroiled in a infernal spiral and unable to perceive what lies beneath all this. Pete Postlewhaite and Chazz Palminteri make their scenes count too.A riveting storytelling a painstaking flashback a tight and firstclass directing a thoughtful twist a topnotch cast the Usual Suspects includes almost everything a director would sell his soul for. Everything contributes to make it a stalwart model in the suspenseful movie and the whole cinema. After the first vision be prepared for mental gymnastics and for a second screening...".

The film is called  The Usual Suspects and what could be more appropriate than an unusual movie about five suspects who are anything but usual.

Legendary among an underground of testosterone and nicotinedriven lowlife 'usual suspects' of this film  Soze  remains unseen fantastic just outside of the camera's view and detached from any reality we might call familiar or real. Nevertheless he is the central character in the film and the single force of will driving the entire film. The viewer like the characters portrayed must constantly ask 'Who is Kaiser Soze does he even exist? and  as silly as it might seem  is he the devil himself?. Soze's irresistible will is represented and enforced by an emissary the stonefaced Pete Postlethwaite who is just as coldhearted as any of the hardened criminals who comprise 'The Usual Suspects'.The narrative begins and almost ends as a retrospective with just a bit of very necessary voiceover narrative by Spacey. His character  Verbal Kint  is interrogated by Palmintieri concerning the murder of several hardened criminals in a single night aboard Russian ship. Most of the major plot points are highlighted wonderfully by the changes of pace and camera work afforded by the shift between one plot  the events leading to Kint's interrogation  and another  the interrogation itself.Kint physically disabled and emotionally disturbed is himself a desperate downonhis luck petty criminal whose chief talent seems to be getting mixed up with and attaching himself to more talented criminals. His latest 'friend'  Keating Byrne is a brilliant but depressive thief who is trying to straighten his life out for a woman lawyer he has fallen for. But along with the other 'usual suspects'  expert safe crackers con men and sociopaths possibly the best performance of Stephen Baldwin's career thus far all  Keating is swept up into agreeing to do 'one final job'. In a fine piece of character interpetation Byrne plays denial to the hilt telling himself that this job if successful could end his life in crime permanently. These expert thieves con men and killers meet in a bogus police lineup one night and from that point on they are bound together under the control of Soze until they either succeed or fail in the crime he has laid before them.Soze has been betrayed whether directly or indirectly by each of these men and he leaves them all no choice. Accept the crime plan or die. They accept knowing that their odds of success are to say the least very limited.The entire feeling of this film shifts radically from the action of the main plot described in Kint's narrative and the narrative itself Kint's interrogation. While this may look simply like a clever piece of film work it is actually a very brilliant plot device as both story lines are finally united in the stunning and brilliant finish.While I am not usually a ready fan of mysteries and even less interested in thrillers this film was pure entertainment from start to finish.Director Singer has established himself as a pioneer in ensemble cast direction and this film alone his third should have awarded him that title.The performances are without exception flawless. While flawlessness or some approximation of it is something I generally expect from people like Spacey Byrne and Del Toro many of the folks in this film very much surprised me. I now watch out for folks like Kevin Pollak for example. Without detracting from the performers whatsoever some credit for the stunning quality of the performances must go to the director editor script and cinematography team. This film makes them all look positively great.I was bitterly disappointed by the fact that this film did not take many Academy Awards in its release year. While I realize that the academy's choices do not always reflect quality or achievement I prefer to maintain at least a superficial guise of hopefulness. The fact that Usual Suspects did not win for editing was the biggest shock. I can not think of a better piece of editing.".

This was true cinema! I was excited 'The Usual Suspects' is a mystery film about what cargo was on board the ship when it was destroyed and the events leading up to it as we are told from the only known survivor of that accident.Around 4550 minutes into the movie I was starting to find myself a bit tired and thought the movie may perhaps have dragged along just a bit. I was becoming rather disappointed. Then the film truly began to change in such a way that I find it rather hard to explain. The characters began to get a little more entertaining the pacing certainly began to pick up the dialogue was getting more interesting and overall I was more excited.Then comes the amazing final twenty minutes with the plot twist and the story finally closing in perfectly making the story more understandable. However the final 5 minutes of the movie are some of the best moments of movie ever made and that is the ultimate plot twist which surprised the hell out of me! It was a cheering end to what ended as a great movie and a movie I would be more than happy to check out again and again! A".

	schema:reviewBody "Boasting petty criminal characters conceived so brilliantly they achieve nearmythological status The Usual Suspects is known for riveting suspense and action an intriguing plot line and a jaw dropping twist at the end. It also features some of the most memorable lines of the 1990s How do you shoot the devil in the backwhat if you miss? The characters Roger Verbal Kint Kevin Spacey Dean Keaton Gabriel Byrne Michael McManus Stephen Baldwin Fred Fenster Benicio Del Toro Todd Hockney Kevin Pollak Dave Kujan Chazz Palminteri and Kobayashi Pete Postlethwaite have real character details and cues.The film is set in the aftermath of a ship fire that totally burns the cargo and crew. Though meek and disabled Verbal is the only survivor to walk away from the incident unscathed. He is taken into custody and grilled by the police. Brilliantly played in a characteristic understated style that earned Spacey an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor Verbal is cleared and allowed to leave. But before he can go agent Kujan from US Customs shows up to interrogate him. Kujan is trying to build a case against Keaton and he wants Verbal to testify in exchange for immunity. Verbal refuses but Kujan still bullies Verbal into recounting his story of Keaton McManus Fenster and Hockney leading up to the explosion on the ship. What follows is a fantastic yarn of lies and halftruths sprinkled within the facts of the case. It is all masterfully portrayed as a series of flashbacks while Verbal and Kujan sip coffee and talk in the LA police station. The story begins six weeks earlier in New York City as Verbal and the other four criminals are brought in to stand sidebyside in a police lineup. None of them are formally charged with a crime and there are indications Keaton has actually gone straight prior to the roundup. But before they are released the five hatch a plan to get revenge on the corrupt NYPD and make a large sum of money in the process by robbing a policeprotected jewel smuggler and leaking news of the police involvement to the press. Keaton is reluctant and must be coaxed into it with the promise that no one will be killed in the heist. He agrees and the quintet pulls off the robbery to perfection. The acting and writing take chances that pay off with each actor fully immersing himself in his role. Del Toro creates a uniquely colorful persona in his portrayal of Fenster Baldwin conveys a reckless abandon and lust for violence Pollak shows steely courage and resolve Byrne is a complex mesh of toughness with motives pulling him in all directions. Each actor is at the top of his game. The five criminals go to Los Angeles to lay low in the aftermath of the New York heist. There they are enticed into another robbery that is also supposed to involve no killing. Unfortunately this LA heist goes horribly wrong. As Verbal recounts this carnage its aftermath and the growing problems and hostility in the crew agent Kujan receives a tip from one of his colleagues who has a survivor pulled from the water near the charred wreckage of the ship. The witness is badly burned and cannot speak English but insists that the man responsible for the destruction of life and property on the ship is named Kaiser Soze. Whether it is attributable to lies in Verbal's yarn or odd casting decisions several characters in The Usual Suspects add to the film's mystique. Chief among these is the Irish Postlethwaite cast as the Japanese Kobayashi. There is a strong clue at the end that the name Kobayashi is used solely to mislead Kujan. But Kobayashi is not the only instance of a character's name failing to match his appearance. Another example is McManus' contact in LA Redfoot which one would expect to be the name of a Native American. But Redfoot appears to be caucasian. Again at the end there is an indication that Verbal used Redfoot to avoid giving Kujan a real name. Strange ethnic inconsistencies crop up constantly. Kaiser Soze is said to be Turkish possibly with a German father. These mixedup character portraits add a layer of complexity to the plot but one must always consider the source Verbal Kint and his motives. The dynamic between Kujan and Verbal itself is pure entertainment. A kind of catandmouse game nuances are thrown into the proceedings that make it more interesting and add depth to the characters. Even the way the interrogation is filmed is unique. Verbal didn't achieve his nickname for no reason. He knows how to run his mouth and Kujan has a difficult challenge in corralling him. Underlying the interrogation is Kujan's suspicion of Keaton and his belief that Keaton manipulated Verbal. But Verbal is hard to pin down and Kujan occasionally resorts to bully tactics. But who is Kaiser Soze? Did he orchestrate the police lineup in New York and pull all the strings ever since? Is the cargo of the ship drugs or only human cargo? Why did Verbal survive unharmed while so many others did not? Did Keaton really die as Verbal insists or did he slip away as Kujan believes? Is Verbal telling the truth? Much is revealed in the final moments of the film which wash over the viewer like an enormous wave of recognition. Snippets of dialogue from earlier in the film are montaged over the complex score providing spinetingling clues about exactly what part of Verbal's yarn was fact and what was fiction. The final snippet of dialogue followed by a fortissimo string finale is especially powerful and like that...he was gone.".

During the questioning the survivor Verbal Kint tells of how events came to happen.  Five criminals are brought together in a line up and decide to use the events to plan a job.  However another survivor tells an extra story  one involving master criminal Kyser Soze.  Kint reveals how the gang were forced into the fateful job by Soze  however who is Soze and why did the men try to steal what appears to be a ship load of drugs that didn't exist?When I first saw this I saw it in the cinema  the very next day I went back and watched it again.  The plot starts with a cliff hanger and appears to gradually answer the mystery   however what it actually does is create more questions for every answer it appears to give.  It does this without frustrating you or without confusing the issue  in fact you don't know right till the end that you've been caught in a story teller's web.  The plot unfolds like a normal thriller but it is anything but.The strength of the film is in the writing but it is the direction that also manages to create a great mood.  Singer uses clever shots weaving the story into a believable web of deceit.  The cast add quality to every single line every single scene.  It's hard to imagine that the film could be the same with any one person changed.Bryne is great as Keaton his world weary cop drawn into a plan he can't control  or is he the master behind it all.  Spacey gives a great performance as our eyes and ears as he retells the events he deservedly won an Oscar for this role  before he got all soft and started becoming a starring man.  Baldwin has the film of his life albeit not hard! he's really good and should be lucky to get another good role.  Even the minor roles in the gang are great  Del Toro's performance is even better when you knew why he did it that way.  Likewise Pollack will never have a better role  he has genuine tension between him and Baldwin even in later interviews the dislike still seems real  with things like Pollack telling Baldwin he's sorry that his brothers stole all the food from his table.  Palminteri does a great performance and is totally convincing.  Postlethwaite is good despite playing an Asian ? lawyer.  Suzi Amis is good in her brief role and Esposito is as good as he always is.Overall I could talk for hours about this film.  It's rare for films now to have decent plots worth talking about however this manages it  it's still twisty and impressive no matter how many times you watch it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I love movies with big twist ending. I love movies that play with your mind and leave you completely confused until the very end where everything finally makes sense.So I should like 'The Usual Suspects' right? Let's see Confusing plot? Check. Big twist? Check. Point of the whole movie? NONE.This movie attempts to be clever by blatantly treating you the audience as an idiot. I pushed through this boring big mess of a movie expecting a huge final revelation that would put all the puzzles pieces together. In the end the movie throws all the puzzle pieces into the fire and laughs at you.SPOILERS but really don't bother watching just readWhat makes a good mystery thriller movie? CLUES! You are supposed to leave clues for the audiences to pick up so that when they watch the movie for a second time they can bang their heads and say Why didn't I notice that the first time? In this movie there is NO CLUE at all. Keyser Soze could have been ANYONE of the characters. The audience could never really know who is Keyser because the whole time we are forced to watch the movie from Verbal's own flawed and purposely misguided perspective! The 'twist' is one big joke. So Verbal is lying all the time? That's a twist? You dare to call that a twist? How brilliant! I could have never see that coming!! No really. You could have never see it coming because there is literally NO WAY for you to see it coming nothing is revealed until the movie almost ended. The only way you could have guessed is because you know the weakest least suspicious man is probably the killer! What a clich. The ending basically makes the rest of the movie completely pointless and gives no reason for me to rewatch the movie again because it would be like listening to a liar tell a story all over again.The plot is another one big problem. The entire first hour of the movie could have been scrapped off and still makes the movie a coherent story. All the useless boring dialogues all the random robberies and gun shooting did absolutely NOTHING to advance the main story or develop any of the character. Nothing relevant actually happens until the part where Kobayashi popped up and revealed the main plot about Keyser Soze and the boat hijacking. So bad twist ending aside the plot doesn't do the movie any justice either.The acting? Nothing amazing. What Verbal does in nearly the whole movie is limp and talk talk talk while giving a straight and near emotionless face. Casting any middleaged balding actor as Verbal would have achieved the same effect. I can't say Spacey is a bad actor because I don't think he is but his performance as Verbal is certainly not Oscarworthy. END SPOILERI understand that movie ratings are subjected to personal tastes and perceptions. I can understand why so many people like movies such as 'The Dark Knight' or 'Reservoir Dogs' even though I find them highly overrated. But I simply cannot accept that a movie like 'The Usual Suspects' is hailed as the greatest twist movie ever even after 20 years when there are so many better ones like 'The Sixth Sense' 'Memento' 'Fight Club' or the highly underrated 'Identity'.Spend your two hours wisely. On anything. Just not on this movie.".

	onyx:emotionText "I love movies with big twist ending. I love movies that play with your mind and leave you completely confused until the very end where everything finally makes sense.So I should like 'The Usual Suspects' right? Let's see Confusing plot? Check. Big twist? Check. Point of the whole movie? NONE.This movie attempts to be clever by blatantly treating you the audience as an idiot. I pushed through this boring big mess of a movie expecting a huge final revelation that would put all the puzzles pieces together. In the end the movie throws all the puzzle pieces into the fire and laughs at you.SPOILERS but really don't bother watching just readWhat makes a good mystery thriller movie? CLUES! You are supposed to leave clues for the audiences to pick up so that when they watch the movie for a second time they can bang their heads and say Why didn't I notice that the first time? In this movie there is NO CLUE at all. Keyser Soze could have been ANYONE of the characters. The audience could never really know who is Keyser because the whole time we are forced to watch the movie from Verbal's own flawed and purposely misguided perspective! The 'twist' is one big joke. So Verbal is lying all the time? That's a twist? You dare to call that a twist? How brilliant! I could have never see that coming!! No really. You could have never see it coming because there is literally NO WAY for you to see it coming nothing is revealed until the movie almost ended. The only way you could have guessed is because you know the weakest least suspicious man is probably the killer! What a clich. The ending basically makes the rest of the movie completely pointless and gives no reason for me to rewatch the movie again because it would be like listening to a liar tell a story all over again.The plot is another one big problem. The entire first hour of the movie could have been scrapped off and still makes the movie a coherent story. All the useless boring dialogues all the random robberies and gun shooting did absolutely NOTHING to advance the main story or develop any of the character. Nothing relevant actually happens until the part where Kobayashi popped up and revealed the main plot about Keyser Soze and the boat hijacking. So bad twist ending aside the plot doesn't do the movie any justice either.The acting? Nothing amazing. What Verbal does in nearly the whole movie is limp and talk talk talk while giving a straight and near emotionless face. Casting any middleaged balding actor as Verbal would have achieved the same effect. I can't say Spacey is a bad actor because I don't think he is but his performance as Verbal is certainly not Oscarworthy.

The narrating character is revealed to be an excellent story teller to be manipulative cunning and incapable of being truly frightened. Those are exactly the characteristics of the mystery character.

	schema:reviewBody "Inspector Gadget 2 is possibly one of the worst sequels to dawn the directtoDVD call tag at the bottom of the box. Using nothings from the original film not the same characters not the same style not the same comic timing this film is one that you have to watch alone not standing right next to the original Broderick vehicle. French Stewart he is always squinting ... why? with the aid of director Alex Zamm try to bring the original concept back the the series without any known budget. Stewart brings a new Inspector to the film a more arrogant snobbish seems to be tormented by life protagonist that cares nothing for those surrounding him. He is a character that we cannot love no matter how many times we have to sit through one viewing of this film. What is interesting about Stewart is that he is actually closer to the the animated Gadget than the original. Zamm also tries to create a Dr. Claw that is closer to the original  but the trouble occurs with the fact that the two share very little screen time and thus there is no real chemistry between the two.

Penny still doesn't have her book and Brain still isn't getting anyone out of trouble. Where is the consistency here? Too add to the mix we are introduced to a new character G2 the newest upgrade to the Gadget line. Like anything this riddled with clichs there is an initial problem with the two of them but eventually a spark misfires and Gadget is introduced to yet another love interest.

There is no sense of individualism just flimsy cause followed by an effect that could have been predicted before the opening credits ended.Inspector Gadget 2 has not seen the best reviews nor will it get a good one from me  it tried but ultimately it failed. There was no purpose to create this erroneous sequel. Disney was hoping to cash in on the Broderick fan base the younger generation that knows no better  or just to make some extra dollars to pad their bottom line but there was no reason to resurrect this already problematic series. I hated Elaine Hendrix's mesh between Robocop and Judge Dredd. She was funny at parts that were not meant to be funny and chokingly bad at parts that were meant to draw sympathy from the audience. Perhaps it was the writing or the campy way that it was filmed or the cheesy ploy to get audiences to laugh but this sequel just left me out to dry. If I had to speak positively about this film in any way I would have to comment on the CGI which did improve a bit with this lowerbudget film. I thought the idea of freezingtime was a fun concept equal to what Claw would do but again we seemed to lack the spunk and originality of the cartoon. I would never consider this franchise a remake of the cartoon but instead their own unoriginal spinoff.I blame Disney a bit for this film because cutting corners and cost is not an excuse for making poor films. If Broderick or even the horrid Everett could not reprise their roles for this sequel it should have just stopped there. Don't push a circular peg into a square hole but instead we continued to push and found cheap replacements for the original. This is a very kid friendly moment that if I were 3 would probably find visually entertaining but from a company that prides itself on making Oscarworthy animation I expect a higher level of distribution. French Stewart should stop working while he still is remembered for his humorous work on Third Rock from the Sun while the rest of this cast shouldn't even bother with another feature. I think it is bad enough that they couldn't even get Cheri Oteri back cause you know she's expensive.Overall I have to say that Inspector Gadget 2 is a blunderment of a film and the one star review that I am giving it is generous. There is no need for these types of films to enter into mainstream cinema. It dulls the senses for those hoping to find engrossing cinema out there and proves that a mind isn't necessary to watch French in action. As a cinematic community we have to put a stop to this. Zamm attempted to retain some of the originality of the cartoon but couldn't compile a cast good enough to bring the humor form grace and talent of the animated series to light. There was no chemistry between anyone and when the clichs began to cause a horrid avalanche I was caught with nowhere to hide. If I had to end with a thought in mind it would be this  Claw never showed his face this can be learned from watching the pilot Inspector Gadget where he had a mustache so you shouldn't be able to see his face in the films. It is simple. It would be like creating the Smurfs liveaction where they were a shade of orange instead of blue. You just don't do it. So when it comes to this film  just don't do it. You will be happier and no so bitter like myself.Grade  out of ".

	onyx:emotionText "Inspector Gadget 2 is possibly one of the worst sequels to dawn the directtoDVD call tag at the bottom of the box. Using nothings from the original film not the same characters not the same style not the same comic timing this film is one that you have to watch alone not standing right next to the original Broderick vehicle. French Stewart he is always squinting ... why? with the aid of director Alex Zamm try to bring the original concept back the the series without any known budget. Stewart brings a new Inspector to the film a more arrogant snobbish seems to be tormented by life protagonist that cares nothing for those surrounding him. He is a character that we cannot love no matter how many times we have to sit through one viewing of this film. What is interesting about Stewart is that he is actually closer to the the animated Gadget than the original. Zamm also tries to create a Dr. Claw that is closer to the original  but the trouble occurs with the fact that the two share very little screen time and thus there is no real chemistry between the two. Claw used to always monitor Gadget's doings in this one there seems to be a haphazard care as to what either is doing. Penny still doesn't have her book and Brain still isn't getting anyone out of trouble. Where is the consistency here?

	schema:headline " No masterpiece but still very funny.";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is no masterpiece but I didn't hate it either. In fact many a time did I watch it when I was younger  and I honestly enjoyed it. It is a Bmovie with no cinema run but is free from the clichs of the genre  no cheesy sound or visual effects no rubbishy acting and no hideously contrived plot. I found this film hilariously funny  and it actually conveys a sense of mystery  what did happen to Claw's face? This film was obviously done on a high budget for a film of its calibre  none of the effects look hideously cheap. The timestopping sequence may have been no Oscar contender but it certainly was not the worst I've seen. The movie is very predictable but all movies are these days  and Inspector Gadget 2 is about the gadgets and fun and on that scale it delivers. When Gadget cleaned the toilets and was thrown across the entire police station when his brush went erratic ranks amongst the funniest things I have ever seen  and that's up against some heavy competition.The film does contain some original ideas  to have a female Gadget who was a huge rival to Inspector Gadget was a very good idea and the main premise for the movie. It is fun trying to watch Inspector Gadget win her heart and though there aren't any Oscarworthy performances to be seen there is some character in this film and it is hugely funny. Another cracking idea was to have Claw's new base at a bowling centre  makes a change from the multimillion dollar headquarters in the first one. And another great idea was to have Inspector Gadget as a bit of a bumbling imbecile instead of the hero in the first one  it worked well and actually added to his charm. He also got sacked in this one  it happens halfway through or so but it doesn't take a genius to know that he's going to rise again. Which he does.Though it is predictable and no masterpiece Inspector Gadget 2 is an absolutely hilarious film and beats the first one hands down  it will have you in stitches. Good but not quite spiffing  Inspector Gadget 2 is not a letdown and certainly not a cheap nasty looking one. The gold deposit actually looked really convincing  but I'm sure they didn't have to spend 5000000000000 on it as it said in the film or even have to bother getting a real gold bar. And on the visual scales alone it delivers. A good film and one that I strongly recommend if you have any sense of humour whatsoever. 810".

It is a Bmovie with no cinema run but is free from the clichs of the genre  no cheesy sound or visual effects no rubbishy acting and no hideously contrived plot. I found this film hilariously funny  and it actually conveys a sense of mystery  what did happen to Claw's face? This film was obviously done on a high budget for a film of its calibre  none of the effects look hideously cheap. The timestopping sequence may have been no Oscar contender but it certainly was not the worst I've seen. The movie is very predictable but all movies are these days  and Inspector Gadget 2 is about the gadgets and fun and on that scale it delivers. When Gadget cleaned the toilets and was thrown across the entire police station when his brush went erratic ranks amongst the funniest things I have ever seen  and that's up against some heavy competition.The film does contain some original ideas  to have a female Gadget who was a huge rival to Inspector Gadget was a very good idea and the main premise for the movie. It is fun trying to watch Inspector Gadget win her heart and though there aren't any Oscarworthy performances to be seen there is some character in this film and it is hugely funny. Another cracking idea was to have Claw's new base at a bowling centre  makes a change from the multimillion dollar headquarters in the first one. And another great idea was to have Inspector Gadget as a bit of a bumbling imbecile instead of the hero in the first one  it worked well and actually added to his charm. He also got sacked in this one  it happens halfway through or so but it doesn't take a genius to know that he's going to rise again. Which he does.Though it is predictable and no masterpiece Inspector Gadget 2 is an absolutely hilarious film and beats the first one hands down  it will have you in stitches. Good but not quite spiffing  Inspector Gadget 2 is not a letdown and certainly not a cheap nasty looking one. The gold deposit actually looked really convincing  but I'm sure they didn't have to spend 5000000000000 on it as it said in the film or even have to bother getting a real gold bar. And on the visual scales alone it delivers. A good film and one that I strongly recommend if you have any sense of humour whatsoever. 810";

	schema:reviewBody "Inspector Gadget is back well kind of. French Stewart takes over the title role from Matthew Broderick who appeared in the original live action film. In the first film our beloved G took down arch enemy The Claw so this movie opens with G on top of the world. As a result of him being praised and awarded by the city G has become a bit smug and too sure of himself. Therefore he is soon arresting the police chief's MOTHER for driving 26 mph in a 25 zone. The crime is drag racing. Needless to say G gets a chewing out from the chief Mark Mitchell his supervisor. Its true G's bright niece Penny keeps her uncle more grounded for she loves to catch criminals too. Now more changes occur. First there is a new crime fighter on the force a robot G2 Elaine Hendrix who has just been invented and will be more reliable than G whose gadgets sometimes go haywire. Although she is a mechanical being G finds her very pretty! Then The Claw Tony Martin not Rupert Everett returns with a surefire plan to raid the Federal Reserve. All of a sudden G lassos the mayor Sigrid Thornton accidentally making her so upset that she kicks G off the force. Needing a new job G tries his hand at everything from burger flipping to valet parking. But can G2 truly stop The Claw on her own? Well she is supposed to be perfect! First I have adored French Stewart from his days on Third Rock from the Sun. He is instinctively very funny no matter what the role and this is one is no exception. Hendrix makes a perfect counterpoint for him while Mitchell does well as the chief. How funny to see Thornton long after her young role in The Man from Snowy River she is still quite beautiful! Martin has a rough voice that is hard to decipher sometimes but he makes a good villain. He gets away in the end setting up other possible sequels. Then the production is gorgeous inventive colorful and fun. Lastly there are laughs galore for every one. Therefore inspect this film up close by showing it to yourself or your close friends and relatives soon.".

Having previously seen the original and been a fan of the original cartoon series I was itching to see what was done.Only one cast member from the first movie returned for this one D. L. Hughly as the voice for the Gadgetmobile. French Stewart takes the title role from Matthew Broderick and while Matthew's performance was one of the few weak performances of his career French nails the character deadon. Tony Martin similarly nails The Claw over Rupert Everett's lessthanmenacing performance. As for Caitlin Wachs versus Michelle Trachtenberg as Penny I think the two are closely matched.And in nearly every way Elaine Hendrix is unbeatable in the role of G2.Director Alex Zamm sought to bring the sequel closer in feel to the original series and he achieves this with aplomb. The Inspector's enthusiastic idiocy with Penny tagging along to bail him out is the theme in what turns into a smrgsbord of slapstick visual puns and other goodness.Personally I would have preferred to keep the real name of John Brown used in the first film for scenes where using the name would have been logical including the deleted Penny at school scene but that's the only substantial change I would have suggested.Not that the film is without weaknesses. Some bits such as the unfortunate toiletcleaning scene could have been substantially shortened and a couple of the deleted scenes seen on the DVD would have helped the movie flow a little better. But on the whole it's a fun romp fit for the whole family.".

Don't get me wrong I'm not saying this is a great movie that warrant's praise but as an Inspector Gadget fan if I got this when I went to theaters I would have left less offended then I did.";

	schema:reviewBody "Disney today has gone through multiple changes throughout its history. There's the classical period the slump period the renaissance period and the rise to super studio power in the late 2000s. However even during the 1990s when Disney was breaking records in its animated films they also were breaking records in flops in another type of film. Those films were in liveaction many of which were derived from cartoons from decades before. For those cases Disney had made some pretty bad films. Mr. Magoo 1997 George of the Jungle 1997 and Inspector Gadget 1999 being relatively the last bunch of theatrical releases to be made for the most part signaled the end of such cartoon liveaction adaptations. But even for Disney nothing would stop the studio giant from making a little extra cash even after that. Some years later Disney would release sequels to some of these movies and for the poorly adapted Inspector Gadget 1999 he too got his own. The question is is it worth a watch?Ehhh...in some respects yes because there seems to be improvement. Then again there really was no need to begin with because a sequel will not make up for the mistakes of the first. With a script written by the director Alex Zamm Chairman of the Board 1998 Tooth Fairy 2 2012 and Jingle All the Way 2 2014 and two other writers the adaptation part of the film is more faithful to that of the original cartoon. And for some viewers that may be all they need because the entirety of the movie does feel more cartoonish than that of the first movie. When Dr. Claw Tony Martin escapes from prison it's up to Inspector Gadget French Stewart his niece Penny Caitlin Wachs and newly activated member G2 Elaine Hendrix to bring the evil mastermind to justice. The idea is as routine as ever but it again sticks to the formula that made the cartoon what it was. Also what makes this film more faithful than the one before is that most of Dr. Claw's face is kept concealed from the audience. It was a big gripe people had with the 1999 film.As stated in the plot prior much of the cast from the first film have been replaced or rewritten out. The only actor who didn't get replaced was D.L. Hughley as the Gadget Mobile because people loved him the most? Also there's no mention of whatever happened to Joely Fisher's role as Brenda who played Gadget's love interest in the first movie. French Stuart as Gadget looks more like his cartoon counterpart than Matthew Broderick. Caitlin Wachs taking over Michelle Trachtenberg's role performed okay but nothing special. As for Claw Tony Martin's portrayal Vs Rupert Everett is not hilariously funny but it's alright. Elaine Hendrix as G2 was okay even though her role was very contrived. It's pretty obvious what she serves as to Gadget. If there's one thing that stays true through this film is that almost every actor chews up the scenery around them. Almost every scene is super hammy. It's not bad occasionally or maybe for one character but even the less important characters are biting at the corners of every frame.With that being said the comedy isn't that funny either. Thankfully Disney toned down the inappropriate humor from the first film but didn't bother fix anything else. The one liners are formulaic and predictable but they do at least sound more believable being delivered from Stewart than Broderick. Dr. Claw also has a bunch of stock henchman that do act like the cartoon but here just feel silly. Of all things why would Dr. Claw hire a single ninja? Also sometimes the dialog doesn't make a lot of sense due to certain characters having knowledge that goes unexplained. How would one specific character know how a mechanical device works if the villain didn't even give the obligatory exposition to them? The stretch of the imagination only goes so far. Seeing Dr. Claw make a weapon out of 3 or 4 nonconnective items is one thing but knowing how it works without even being told? Yeah...not buying it.Even with this mediocre writing there is still some visual integrity. The special effects to this entry are adequate for its budget even though they are not as polished as the first film. However considering it was 12 million Vs 75 million estimated that's not entirely bad. There are places where it's noticeably fake though. The cinematography shot by Geoffrey Wharton who is usually just a camera operator does okay here. There's no strange angles or up close facial zoomins so that's praiseworthy. Anything else though is just standard shooting. The musical score composed by Chris Hajian is okay too. Even though the sound is not as bombastic as John Debney's version of the first one Hajian retains the Inspector Gadget theme and does what he can to make it sound acceptable for a DVD sequel. The overall product is still messy but some may like it more than the original film.Having its cast mainly replaced the actors are a lot hammier the comedy is still predictable and the effects do look somewhat cheaper. However some of the writing does follow the cartoon more this time than the first movie and although not everything makes sense it feels more like an extended cartoon episode. So that kind works in its favor.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is a scene about halfway through the movie Casablanca that has become commonly known as 'The Battle of the Anthems' throughout the film's long history. A group of German soldiers has come into Rick's Caf American and are drunkenly singing the German National Anthem at the top of their voice. Victor Lazlo the leader of the French Resistance cannot stand this act and while the rest of the club stares appalled at the Germans Lazlo orders the band to play 'Le Marseilles sic?' the French National Anthem. With a nod from Rick the band begins playing with Victor singing at the top of HIS voice. This in turn inspires the whole club to begin singing and the Germans are forced to surrender and sit down at their table humbled by the crowd's dedication. This scene is a turning point in the movie for reasons that I leave to you to discover. As I watched this movie again tonight for what must be the 100th time I noticed there was a much smaller scene wrapped inside the bigger scene that unless you look for it you may never notice. Yvonne a minor character who is hurt by Rick emotionally falls into the company of a German soldier. In a land occupied by the Germans but populated by the French this is an unforgivable sin. She comes into the bar desperately seeking happiness in the club's wine song and gambling. Later as the Germans begin singing we catch a glimpse of Yvonne sitting dejectedly at a table alone and in this brief glimpse it is conveyed that she has discovered that this is not her path to fulfillment and she has no idea where to go from there. As the singing progresses we see Yvonne slowly become inspired by Lazlo's act of defiance and by the end of the song tears streaming down her face she is singing at the top of her voice too. She has found her redemption. She has found something that will make her life never the same again from that point on. Basically this is Casablanca in a nutshell. On the surface you may see it as a romance or as a story of intrigue but that is only partially correct.The thing that makes Casablanca great is that it speaks to that place in each of us that seeks some kind of inspiration or redemption. On some level every character in the story receives the same kind of catharsis and their lives are irrevocably changed. Rick's is the most obvious in that he learns to live again instead of hiding from a lost love. He is reminded that there are things in the world more noble and important than he is and he wants to be a part of them. Louis the scoundrel gets his redemption by seeing the sacrifice Rick makes and is inspired to choose a side where he had maintained careful neutrality. The stoic Lazlo gets his redemption by being shown that while thousands may need him to be a hero there is someone he can rely upon when he needs inspiration in the form of his wife who was ready to sacrifice her happiness for the chance that he would go on living. Even Ferrai the local organized crime leader gets a measure of redemption by pointing Ilsa and Lazlo to Rick as a source of escape even though there is nothing in it for him. This is the beauty of this movie. Every time I see it and I have seen it a lot it never fails that I see some subtle nuance that I have never seen before. Considering that the director would put that much meaning into what is basically a throw away moment not the entire scene but Yvonne's portion speaks bundles about the quality of the film. My wife and I watched this movie on our first date and since that first time over 12 years ago it has grown to be in my mind the greatest movie ever made.".

And does any film appeal to a broader audience? Just everything about it seems to be as close to perfection as it only can be.But what exactly is so special about it? Is it its great genre mix never equaled by another film? When we think of 'Casablanca' first we remember it as a romantic film well most of us do. But then again its also a drama involving terror murder and flight. One can call it a character study centering on Rick. And there are quite a few moments of comedic delight just think of the pickpocket This place is full of vultures vultures everywhere! or the elderly couple on the last evening before their emigration to the US What watch?.But 'Casablanca' is not only great as a whole it still stands on top if we break it apart and look at single lines of dialog scenes or performances alone. Is there any other film which has more quotable dialog than 'Casablanca'? 'Pulp Fiction' is on my mind here and 'All About Eve' and 'Sunset Blvd.' come close too but still I think 'Casablanca' tops everything else. And not only is the dialog great it's unforgettably delivered especially by Humphrey Bogart I was misinformed. and Claude Rains I am shocked shocked to find that gambling is going on here. Many of scenes have become a part of film history the duel of 'Die Wacht am Rhein' and 'La Marseillaise' is probably one of the greatest scenes ever shot the only I can think of that would rival it for the 1 spot is Hynkel and the globe from Chaplin's 'The Great Dictator' and the last scene is probably even familiar to the few people who've never seen 'Casablanca'. Am I the only one who is absolutely convinced that the film wouldn't have become what it is today if Rick and Ilsa would have ended up as the lucky couple?About the performances So much has been said about the uniqueness of Humphrey Bogart's and Ingrid Bergman's chemistry as Rick and Ilsa about Claude Rains' terrific turn as Renault about the scenestealing performances by Peter Lorre one of the 10 alltime greatest actors as Ugarte and Sydney Greenstreet as Ferrari and about Dooley Wilson stopping the show as Sam. I'd love to emphasize here two other performances one that is not mentioned quite as often and one which is blatantly overlooked Conrad Veidt as Major Strasser had a really difficult task here as his character is the only evil one but still Strasser is not a onedimensional character and it took more than 50 years until another actor gave an equally maybe even more impressive performance as a Nazi Ralph Fiennes in 'Schindler's List'. But why no one ever mentions S. K. Sakall who plays Carl the jolly waiter at Rick's Caf Amricain is beyond me. He has definitely more screen time than Lorre Greenstreet and Wilson and probably about as much as Veidt and he's a joy whenever he's on the screen. I simply love his reaction when the pickpocket Vultures everywhere! accidentally bumps into him or the reaction to the What watchdialog. Or how he says he gave Strasser the best table being a German he would have taken it anyway. His performance is simply criminally overlooked.So is there a weakest link in 'Casablanca'? Every film no matter how close to perfection has a minor flaw or two so one can find them in 'Casablanca' too if one really tries hard. So yes one might ask how much sense the entire mumbo jumbo about the letters of transit makes. One might point out that Paul Henreid although his performance is certainly good doesn't come close to the greatness of any of his costars. However the film is so close to perfection that I'm almost ashamed that I'm so desperately trying to find lessthanperfect elements.So whatever films will come how many sequels will overflow the screen and how much junk we will have to sit through one thing is certain if we're desperate to see a great film We'll always have Casablanca!".

	schema:reviewBody "Casablanca remains Hollywood's finest moment a film that succeeds on such a vast scale not because of anything experimental or deliberately earthshaking in its design but for the way it cohered to and reaffirmed the moviemaking conventions of its day. This is the film that played by the rules while elevating the form and remains the touchstone for those who talk about Hollywood's greatness.It's the first week in December 1941 and in the Vichycontrolled African port city of Casablanca American expat Rick Blaine runs a gin joint he calls Rick's Cafe Americaine. Everybody comes to Rick's including thieves spies Nazis partisans and refugees trying to make their way to Lisbon and eventually America. Rick is a tough sour kind of guy but he's still taken for a loop when fate hands him two sudden twists A pair of unchallengeable exit visas and a woman named Ilsa who left him brokenhearted in Paris and now needs him to help her and her resistanceleader husband escape.Humphrey Bogart is Rick and Ingrid Bergman is Ilsa in roles that are archetypes in film lore. They are great parts besides very multilayered and resistant to stereotype and both actors give career performances in what were great careers. He's mad at her for walking out on him while she wants him to understand her cause but there's a lot going on underneath with both and it all spills out in a scene in Rick's apartment that is one of many legendary moments.Casablanca is a great romance not only for being so supremely entertaining with its humor and realisticthoughexotic wartime excitement but because it's not the least bit mushy. Take the way Rick's face literally breaks when he first sees Ilsa in his bar or how he recalls the last time he saw her in Paris The Germans wore gray you wore blue. There's a real human dimension to these people that makes us care for them and relate to them in a way that belies the passage of years.For me and many the most interesting relationship in the movie is Rick and Capt. Renault the police prefect in Casablanca who is played by Claude Rains with a wonderful subtlety that builds as the film progresses. Theirs is a relationship of almost perfect cynicism oneliners and professions of neutrality that provide much humor as well as give a necessary display of Rick's darker side before and after Ilsa's arrival.But there's so much to grab onto with a film like this. You can talk about the music or the way the setting becomes a living character with its floodlights and Moorish traceries. Paul Henreid is often looked at as a bit of a third wheel playing the role of Ilsa's husband but he manages to create a moral center around which the rest of the film operates and his enigmatic relationship with Rick and especially Ilsa a woman who obviously admires her husband but can't somehow ever bring herself to say she loves him is something to wonder at.My favorite bit is when Rick finds himself the target of an entreaty by a Bulgarian refugee who just wants Rick's assurance that Capt. Renault is trustworthy and that if she does a bad thing to secure her husband's happiness it would be forgivable. Rick flashes on Ilsa suppresses a grimace tries to buy the woman off with a oneliner Go back to Bulgaria then finally does a marvelous thing that sets the whole second half of the film in motion without much calling attention to itself.It's not fashionable to discuss movie directors after Chaplin and before Welles but surely something should be said about Michael Curtiz who not only directed this film but other great features like Captain Blood and Angels With Dirty Faces. For my money his Adventures Of Robin Hood was every bit Casablanca's equal and he even found time the same year he made Casablanca to make Yankee Doodle Dandy. When you watch a film like this you aren't so much aware of the director but that's really a testament to Curtiz's artistry. Casablanca is not only exceptionally wellpaced but incredibly wellshot every frame feeling wellthoughtout and legendary without distracting from the overall story.Curtiz was a product of the studio system not a maverick like Welles or Chaplin but he found greatness just as often and Casablanca also a product of the studio system is the best example. It's a film that reminds us why we go back to Hollywood again and again when we want to refresh our imaginations and why we call it the dream factory. As the hawker of linens tells Ilsa at the bazaar You won't find a treasure like this in all Morocco. Nor for that matter in all the world.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are literally hundreds of comments about this movie on IMDB.  Many of them exhort its greatness.  I don't disagree with them.But I'd like to add a suggestion to those of you out there who haven't seen this film.  I'd like to tell you HOW to watch it.The people who made this movie didn't think they were producing a masterpiece. Bergman left the shoot disgusted.  The screenwriters were on salary for Warners writing half a dozen movies a year and this was just one more.  Bogie was punching the clock in the middle of a workhorse career.So as an audience member you can't sit down expecting gilded greatness.Don't have a Casablaca party.  Don't watch it on your first date hoping it will lend that Romantic Touch.  Don't watch it as part of your I need to watch the Best 10 movies of all time Film School project.Buy this movie on DVD.  Have it at the ready.  And then one Friday night when your plans fall through and you find it's 1030pm and there's nothing on TV that's any good open a six pack of beer or pour yourself some wine and watch this movie in a darkened room.The characters in Casablanca are absolutely devoid of sentimentalism.  Every one of them sees the world without a hint of rose color in their lenses.  As Rick says Three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this big old world.  If you're in a mood where you understand what he's saying watch this movie and it will transport you.There is no single movie that deserves to be called the best movie of all time.  Because movies when all is said and done don't amount to a hill of beans.  They are meant to entertain us not for us to worship THEM.But no movie has ever known this fact like Casablanca.If you watch Casablance this way with no expectations with no hype you might catch 10 percent of its greatness on one viewing.  And that will be enough to start you on your way.Happy viewing kid.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's one of the great Hollywood legends how George Raft helped make Humphrey Bogart a leading man by turning down in succession High Sierra The Maltese Falcon and Casablanca. Maybe Raft showed some good sense in letting a better actor handle those roles. In any event we've got some proof in the case of Casablanca.Check out some time a film called Background to Danger that Warner Brothers did with George Raft that also featured Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet. Had Raft ever done Casablanca the film would have been a routine actionadventure story just like Background to Danger. Instead with Bogey we get that but also one of the great love stories of the century. Humphrey Bogart set the standard for playing expatriate American soldiers of fortune in Casablanca. Right now he's between wars running Rick's Cafe Americain in Casablanca in Morocco an area controlled for the moment by the Vicky French government. He's got his fingers in a whole lot of pies but Bogey operates with his own code of ethics. He sticks his neck out for nobody.Nobody except the great love of his life Ingrid Bergman who left him mysteriously in Paris as he was fleeing the oncoming German occupation. She walks back into his life with a husband Paul Henreid who is a well known antifascist leader.The rest of the film is a contest for Bogey's soul. Torn between his great love his own antifascist beliefs and certain practical necessities of operating a liquor and gaming establishment in a hostile environment. So many things combine to make Casablanca the great film it is. Ingrid Bergman's lovely incandescence melding and melting Bogey's cynical screen persona. The indelible characterizations of Peter Lorre Sydney Greenstreet Claude Rains Conrad Veidt and the whole rest of a 100 perfectly cast film. And the revival of a great ballad which serves as Casablanca's theme song.I say revival because As Time Goes By was introduced in 1931 in the George White Scandals on Broadway by Rudy Vallee. He made a record of it which sold quite a few disks back then. But by the merest of coincidences there was a strike that lasted two years that just began around the time Casablanca came out. The Musicians Union struck against the record companies. With no new records being made RCA Victor rereleased Vallee's record and it became a monster hit on revival.Also when Casablanca came out as if the White House had a personal interest in the film FDR and Churchill had the first of their wartime conferences inCasablanca of all places. Jack Warner must have said a prayer for that to happen.There are so many classic scenes and lines from Casablanca you can write a comment just by listing them. But my favorite has always been when the Germans have taken over Rick's place and are singing some of their songs Paul Henreid goes to orchestra leader and asks him to lead La Marsellaise. With a nod from Bogey the orchestra plays Henreid leads them and the rest of the nonGermans in the cafe join in. Over 60 years later one still gets a thrill from that act of defiance.Bogart and Rains were nominated for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor. Any of the others could have been as well. As I said before Casablanca is perfectly cast right down to minor roles like Curt Bois as a pickpocket John Qualen as a fellow resistance leader and S.Z. Sakall as a waiter at Rick's. If there was an award for ensemble cast Casablanca would have won it. As it was it did win for Best Picture of 1943 and best director for Michael Curtiz.Casablanca will be seen and loved by filmgoers for generations unto infinity as time goes by.".

When I saw this film almost frame by frame in the limited book series of classic films that were produced in the late 1960s I was stunned by the subtlety of facial expressions that conveyed so much of Rick Blaine's character by a marvelous actor Humphrey Bogart.

The line that sticks out the most for me and which against cheers from New Yorkers whenever it plays in the theater.  It is when Bogart says to the Nazis seated at his table There are parts of New York I wouldn't advise you to invade.  And what makes this line so memorable is that Humphrey Bogart did indeed star in another motion picture for Warner Brothers where that very thing formed the basis for the script.  That movie was All Through The Night. I love this movie too and I'm not even a New Yorker.There have been many attempts to revisit Casablanca but only the original makes you really feel what it was like to live through The Good War in a faraway place like Casablanca in French Morocco.Even  though such trickery as midget airport workers fog machines and cardboard cutout airplanes were utilized this film convinces through its beautiful story with many layers and characters that are so well realized.If you've never seen this movie before shame on you and see it immediately.

Set in World War II Casablanca a Moroccan city under the control of the collaborationist Vichy French government the movie starts with a news wire that two German couriers have been murdered and their letters of transit stolen.  Each letter will permit one person to leave Casablanca to a neutral country.Enter Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine owner of the shady but cheerful Cafe Americaine.  Rick is a cynical and hardnosed man whose motto is I stick my neck out for nobody.  Like many a cynic Rick is an embittered exidealist still nursing his wounds from being abandoned by his lover Ilsa Ingrid Bergman.  By chance he falls into possession of the missing letters of transit.Enter Ilsa who comes to Casablanca on the arm of Czech Resistance leader Victor Laszlo Paul Henreid a few steps ahead of the Nazi police.  We now have three people and two letters of transit.  Who will reach America and who will stay in Casablanca?I know no other movie that so perfectly balances humor romance and drama. The soul of good drama lies in presenting characters with hard choices and few choices are as hard or as illuminating of the protagonists' makeup as the choices in CASABLANCA.  All of the characters must decide what they will give up for love for honor and for themselves.  The scenes of Rick and Ilsa's love years ago in Paris are some of the finest romantic scenes in cinema.  And the humor particularly in the person of Casablanca's Prefect of Police Louis Renault has contributed dozens of dry witticisms to our everyday language  I am shocked! Shocked!  The Germans wore gray you wore blue.  I was misinformed.  It would take a miracle to get you out of Casablanca and the Germans have outlawed miracles.  So perfectly blended are these three major elements that you cannot point to a single shot or scene that should have been eliminated from the movie.  Never try to watch only one scene from CASABLANCA you will inevitably be absorbed until the very end of the film.  It is little short of miraculous that the chaotically mismanaged shooting of this movie resulted in such a magnificent final product it speaks volumes for luck and for Owen Marks' and Michael Curtiz' postproduction editing.I have never encountered a movie whose supporting cast was so perfectly realized.  Every minor character is a fleshedout realistic individual from Sasha to Carl the headwaiter to Rick's competitor Ferrari to the selfeffacing criminal Ugarte.  Claude Rains' Captain Renault I'm only a poor corrupt official steals scene after scene and Dooley Wilson's Sam is a refreshingly loyal charismatic and sympathetic conception from an era when almost all black characters were rendered as demeaning stereotypes. The only character who tastes of the cliche is the villainous Major Strasser which can be forgiven in a wartime production.The only film I have ever seen as tautly effective as CASABLANCA is GLORY. Although the 54th Mass.'s story is arguably superior even to CASABLANCA for sheer dramatic power and acting talent GLORY lacks CASABLANCA's wonderful humor and romance which causes me to give the edge to Curtiz' classic as the betterrounded movie.  I have yet to see CASABLANCA surpassed.Rating  out of .".

	schema:reviewBody "In December 1941 American expatriate Rick Blaine owns an upscale nightclub and gambling den in Casablanca. Rick's Caf Amricain attracts a varied clientele including Vichy French and German officials refugees desperate to reach the stillneutral United States and those who prey on them. Although Rick professes to be neutral in all matters he ran guns to Ethiopia during its war with Italy and fought on the Loyalist side in the Spanish Civil War.Petty crook Ugarte boasts to Rick of letters of transit obtained by murdering two German couriers. The papers allow the bearers to travel freely around Germancontrolled Europe and to neutral Portugal and are priceless to the refugees stranded in Casablanca. Ugarte plans to sell them at the club and asks Rick to hold them. Before he can meet his contact Ugarte is arrested by the local police under the command of Captain Louis Renault the unabashedly corrupt Vichy prefect of police. Ugarte dies in custody without revealing that he entrusted the letters to Rick.Now let's clear up some rumors. Muh has been written about Casablanca but a few rumors often get repeated. One of them is Ingrid Bergman saying The screenplay was not completed when they started shooting. That is not true. Warner Brothers never put a film into production unless they had a complete screenplay. Now they kept a few things secret from Ingrid Bergman. She did not have a complete screenplay. The director and Warners thought they would get a better performance out of her if she did not know a few things. However it was not uncommon for things to change while a film was in production. Casablanca was no exception! Another rumor was that Ronald Reagan was cast to play Ric! He was only thought of but for only a few seconds. Almost everyone in Hollywood was until Bogart was cast! Rumor 3 The film was an out of control production! This is not true! This was shot in 18 days. Another things people don't quit notice is how fast people talk in this film! The film runs 102 minutes. The screenplay is 125 minutes. The average screenplay is one minute of screen time per written page! If this film was made by today's standards it would run almost 45 minutes longer.Now if you never seen the film you are lucky. The film is exciting as it is romantic. Not one minute of screen time is squandered. Today's filmmakers would not know how to make a film like this unless Batman plays Ric!".

Rick's Caf Amricain attracts a varied clientele including Vichy French and German officials refugees desperate to reach the stillneutral United States and those who prey on them. Although Rick professes to be neutral in all matters he ran guns to Ethiopia during its war with Italy and fought on the Loyalist side in the Spanish Civil War.Petty crook Ugarte boasts to Rick of letters of transit obtained by murdering two German couriers. The papers allow the bearers to travel freely around Germancontrolled Europe and to neutral Portugal and are priceless to the refugees stranded in Casablanca. Ugarte plans to sell them at the club and asks Rick to hold them. Before he can meet his contact Ugarte is arrested by the local police under the command of Captain Louis Renault the unabashedly corrupt Vichy prefect of police. Ugarte dies in custody without revealing that he entrusted the letters to Rick.Now let's clear up some rumors. Muh has been written about Casablanca but a few rumors often get repeated. One of them is Ingrid Bergman saying The screenplay was not completed when they started shooting. That is not true. Warner Brothers never put a film into production unless they had a complete screenplay. Now they kept a few things secret from Ingrid Bergman. She did not have a complete screenplay. The director and Warners thought they would get a better performance out of her if she did not know a few things. However it was not uncommon for things to change while a film was in production. Casablanca was no exception! Another rumor was that Ronald Reagan was cast to play Ric! He was only thought of but for only a few seconds. Almost everyone in Hollywood was until Bogart was cast! Rumor 3 The film was an out of control production! This is not true! This was shot in 18 days. Another things people don't quit notice is how fast people talk in this film! The film runs 102 minutes. The screenplay is 125 minutes. The average screenplay is one minute of screen time per written page! If this film was made by today's standards it would run almost 45 minutes longer.Now if you never seen the film you are lucky. The film is exciting as it is romantic. Not one minute of screen time is squandered. Today's filmmakers would not know how to make a film like this unless Batman plays Ric!";

	schema:reviewBody "Sunday November the 20th is the anniversary of Marcel Dalio's death in 1983. It was the end of a serendipitous life. You know him. He was a citizen of the world. Born Israel Moshe Blauschild in Paris in 1900 he became a much soughtafter character actor. His lovely animated face with its great expressive eyes became familiar across Europe. He appeared in Jean Renoir's idiosyncratic Rules of the Game and Grand Illusion arguably the greatest of all films. True to his Frenchman's heart he married the very young breathtaking beauty Madeleine LeBeau. He worked with von Stroheim and Pierre Chenal. He had it all.But then the Germans crushed Poland swept across Belgium and pressed on toward Paris. He waited until the last possible moment and finally with the sound of artillery clearly audible with Madeleine fled in a borrowed car to Orleans and then in a freight train to Bordeaux and finally to Portugal. In Lisbon they bribed a crooked immigration official and were surreptitiously given two visas for Chile. But on arriving in Mexico City it was discovered the visas were rank forgeries. Facing deportation Marcel and Madeleine found themselves making application for political asylum with virtually every country in the western hemisphere. Weeks passed until Canada finally issued them temporary visas and they left for Montreal.Meanwhile France had fallen and in the process of subjugating the country the Germans had found some publicity stills of Dalio. A series of posters were produced and were then displayed throughout the city with the caption 'a typical Jew' so that citizens could more easily report anyone suspected of unrepentant Jewishness. The madness continued. 'Entree des artistes' a popular film was ordered reedited so that Dalio's scenes could be deleted and reshot with another nonJewish actor.After a short time friends in the film industry arranged for them to arrive in Hollywood. Nearly broke Marcel was immediately put to work in a string of largely forgettable films. Madeleine a budding actress in her own right was ironically cast in 'Hold Back the Dawn' a vehicle for Charles Boyer with a plot driven by the efforts of an migr Boyer trying desperately to cross into the United States from Mexico. But the real irony was waiting at Warner Brothers.In early 1942 Jack Warner was driving production of a film based on a one act play 'Everybody Comes to Rick's' but had no screenplay. What he had was a mishmash of treatments loosely based on the play and two previous movies. But he had a projected release date and a commitment to his distributors to have a movie for that time slot and little else. Warner Brothers started to wing it.Shooting started without a screenplay and little plot. Principal players were cast and a director hired but casting calls for supporting roles and bit players continued and sometime in the early spring Marcel Dalio and Madeleine LeBeau were cast as respectively a croupier and a romantic entanglement for the male lead. Veteran screenwriters were hired to produce a running screenplay sometimes delivering pages of dialogue one day for scenes to be shot the following day. No one knew exactly where the plot would go or how the story would turn out. No one was sure of the ending. And of course they produced a classic perhaps the finest American movie.They produced a screenplay of multiple genres rich with characterizations perfectly in tune with the unfolding events in Europe and loaded with talent from top to bottom. Oh and they changed the title to 'Casablanca'.It is so well known that many lines of longmemorized dialogue have passed into the slang idiom. 'We'll always have Paris' 'I was misinformed' 'Here's looking at you kid' ' I am shocked! Shocked! To find that there's gambling going on in here!' 'Louis I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship' 'Oh he's just like any other man only more so' 'I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cutrate one' 'Round up the usual suspects' and of course the oft quoted apocryphal 'Play it again Sam'.Madeleine LeBeau plays Yvonne the jilted lover of Humphrey Bogart who is seen drowning her sorrows at the bar early in the film and who later to get back at Rick and looking for solace takes up with a German officer finding only selfhatred. She is luminous.And when Claude Rains delivers the signature line 'I'm shocked! Shocked! To find that there's gambling going on in here!' the croupier Emil played by Marcel Dalio approaches from the roulette table and says simply 'Your winnings sir.' It is a delicious moment ripe with scripted irony one among many in this film but one made all the more so knowing where Dalio came from and what he and his wife had endured to arrive at that line.I have often wondered exactly when they saw the final script or if they only realised the many parallels to their own lives when the film was released.Alas they separated and divorced the next year both going on to long successful careers. Dalio never remarried.Late in his career when Mike Nichols was looking for a vaguely familiar face to deliver a long and worldly nearmonologue in Catch22 he turned to Dalio. Faced with a hopelessly idealistic young American pilot Dalio as simply 'old man in whore house' in tight closeup delivers a discourse on practical people faced with impractical circumstances of the virtues of expedience in the face of amorality . Using his wonderful plastic features now beginning to sag in a voice full of melancholy the old man reassures the young man that regardless of what 'grand themes' may be afoot in the world in the end little matters but survival.".

Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman are magnificent as the tormented love interest duo who do not seem to be able to piece everything together they just know they love each other and more importantly something clicks!!! Originally Ronald Reagan and Ann Sheriden were cast for the roles of Rick and Ilsa as it turns out you cannot imagine any two other people besides Humphry Bogart and Ingrid Bergman for the roles!! These two performers exude more of a continental flair!! The American fascination for this flick is thoroughly justified!! Winning the academy award for best picture in 1943 Casablanca was just one of the many movies in the late 1930's and early 1940's which epitomized an era for excellent movies!! Based on the book Everybody Comes To Ricks Hal B. Wallis produces this film with a flawless orchestration!! The place Casablanca becomes a citadel of despondence and despair for so many people yet for Rick and Ilsa Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman the situation is tailor made for a passionate redemption!! Max Steiner encompasses a necessary nostalgia with the music in this film. As Time Goes By made in 1931 became enormously popular with this movie!! The whole scene is set up whereby Paris becomes a venue for unprecedented and wondrous romanticism!! Casablanca is without question one of the greatest movies ever made!! You must remember this a movie is just a movie!! Unless!! It is the movie of all time Casablanca!! I will see Casablanca over and over and over again and never be tired of it!! EVERYBODY SHOULD SEE THIS MOVIE!! I guarantee you you will not be disappointed!!! This film has 6 of the top 100 famous quotes in the history of all American film making!! Humphrey Bogart and Marlon Brando may lay claim to the most quotes from this list. Many colloquialisms from Casablanca have fallen within the realm of popular modern day jargon!! This website ranks Casablanca 11th best picture out of the top 250. AFI American Film Institue ranks Casablanca the second best American film ever made. I feel this is very impressive!!

I don't think the ending that exists in Casablanca could be filmed today and though most have seen this movie or any of its parodies I don't want to give anything away. But I encourage you to compare the ending of this movie with the endings of other romantic movies such as An Affair to Remember Sleepless in Seattle and even the most recent animated Sinbad movie. Contrast their endings with Casablanca's ending and you see how Casablanca resonates. Many movies have tried to emulate the ending of Casablanca but it never quite rings true because hollywood movies aren't allowed to have this ending yet the only ones who try are either independent or antihollywood.".

Ilsa Ingrid Bergman and Victor Laszlo Paul Henreid seek asylum here in politically neutral Casablanca and like other European refugees gravitate to Rick's upscale caf near the city's airport with its revolving searchlight.Rick is a middleaged cynic who also has a touch of sentimentalism especially for people in need like Ilsa and Victor. The film's story is ideal for romantics everywhere.Much of the plot takes place inside Rick's caf an ornate nightclub with archways and high ceilings. Rick's is a gathering place for an eclectic mix of patrons from locals to those who have arrived from countries throughout Europe. It's this deliciously international ambiance of Rick's caf that renders this film so appealing with a variety of interesting accents clothes and uniforms. And of course there's Sam the piano player who plays all the favorites including As Time Goes By.All of the film's technical elements are excellent including the script with its colorful characters like the debonair Captain Renault Claude Rains and Signor Ferrari Sydney Greenstreet the articulate and portly leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca. And a minor character that made an impression on me was the guitar playing female singer at Rick's Corinna Mura whose beautifully operatic voice was an unexpected delight in this smoke filled saloon.The film's dialogue though substantial is clever and lively like when Captain Renault observes Rick escorting an intoxicated woman out of the bar How extravagant you are throwing away women like that some day they may be scarce.Highcontrast BW lighting renders a noir look. And that pounding score at the film's beginning is stunning it evokes a feeling of faroff adventure.Casablanca differs from traditional noir films mostly as a result of its ending. Rick must make a choice between his own interests and the interests of others. The choice he makes enjoins viewers to a sense of courage and optimism an individual's example of proper collective behavior in the war against Nazi Germany.".

Rick must make a choice between his own interests and the interests of others. The choice he makes enjoins viewers to a sense of courage and optimism an individual's example of proper collective behavior in the war against Nazi Germany.";

The acting is great cinematography firstrate and the story offers an interesting mix of drama action romance music...you name it. This film has everything but color which might prohibit of a lot of younger folks from ever checking this classic out. That would be a shame because film making doesn't get much better than Casablanca.All of this doesn't mean it's my favorite film of alltime. It isn't even in my top ten but I always find it very very enjoyable and the latest 2disc DVD transfer makes it even better to view.Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman of course are the stars but I always found Claude Raines' character the best to watch. His witty dialog as the police chief always makes me smile. He has many clever lines and isn't a guy you can figure out. He and Bogart's character are similar essentially coming across as people who only care about themselves but deep inside are goodhearted people.The ending is much discussed and very famous and helps make the movie so revered. There has been so much written about this film that there I won't add more except to make one negative statement but that's about a line in the story and not a reflection on the quality of the film. I wasn't impressed that Bergman despite being married was willing to run off with Bogart claiming she doesn't know what's right or wrong! Are you serious? Well judging by the marriage records of Hollywood over the years maybe they don't know adultery just might be wrong. Anyway other than that this is a great movie with many many classic scenes. Bergman never looked prettier albeit the aid of soft lens shots on her closeups and Bogey was never more well Bogey than in here. Add Paul Henreid Sydney Greenstreet Peter Lorre and other fine actors and wow what a cast!An added bonus is hearing As Time Goes By throughout the film a haunting song. Actually there are several songs played mainly by pianist Dooley Wilson and they're all fun to hear. As I said one could go on and on about this movie. 'Nuff said.".

This intelligent movie also depends a lot on its superb cast of course. Bogart portrays a terrific character herea performance that yet has to find its equal.

	schema:reviewBody "On the evening of February 27th 1947 in Taipei police ruthlessly beat a woman selling illegal cigarettes and the next day opened fire on a protest demonstration outside the Presidential Palace. Years of resentment against a government increasingly defined by nepotism corruption and suppression of human rights exploded in open conflict. As soon as the troops arrived they began the systematic round up and execution of scholars lawyers doctors students and local leaders of the protest movement. In total between 18000 and 28000 people were murdered by Chinese troops sent from the mainland by Chiang Kaishek. Thousands of others were arrested and imprisoned and martial law was established in what became known as the White Terror campaign.Hou Hsiaohsien's magnificent 1989 film City of Sadness brings to light the truth about the 1947 massacre known as the 228 incident. Winner of the Golden Lion Award at the 1989 Venice Film Festival City of Sadness treats one of the key issues of Taiwanese history yet is far from being a political film. Its focus is not on the bloodshed but on the consequences for a particular family and how individual experience is impacted by the flow of time and history. In the film Wenheung Chen Sownyung the oldest of four Lin brothers tries to hold the family together with the support of Ahlu Li Tenlu the family patriarch. A brutish feverishly emotional man he has turned his Japanese bar into a family restaurant known as Little Shanghai but finds his business undermined by ruthless Shanghai gangsters. The second brother Wensun disappeared in the Philippines and is talked about but never seen in the film.Brother number three Wenleung Jack Gao suffered mental problems as a direct result of the war and is bedridden at a local hospital.

Though the film was criticized by some for being politically ambiguous and historically inaccurate the film's depiction of political events and its impact on Taiwan is clear and unmistakable.

	onyx:emotionText "On the evening of February 27th 1947 in Taipei police ruthlessly beat a woman selling illegal cigarettes and the next day opened fire on a protest demonstration outside the Presidential Palace. Years of resentment against a government increasingly defined by nepotism corruption and suppression of human rights exploded in open conflict. As soon as the troops arrived they began the systematic round up and execution of scholars lawyers doctors students and local leaders of the protest movement. In total between 18000 and 28000 people were murdered by Chinese troops sent from the mainland by Chiang Kaishek. Thousands of others were arrested and imprisoned and martial law was established in what became known as the White Terror campaign.Hou Hsiaohsien's magnificent 1989 film City of Sadness brings to light the truth about the 1947 massacre known as the 228 incident. Winner of the Golden Lion Award at the 1989 Venice Film Festival City of Sadness treats one of the key issues of Taiwanese history yet is far from being a political film. Its focus is not on the bloodshed but on the consequences for a particular family and how individual experience is impacted by the flow of time and history. In the film Wenheung Chen Sownyung the oldest of four Lin brothers tries to hold the family together with the support of Ahlu Li Tenlu the family patriarch. A brutish feverishly emotional man he has turned his Japanese bar into a family restaurant known as Little Shanghai but finds his business undermined by ruthless Shanghai gangsters. The second brother Wensun disappeared in the Philippines and is talked about but never seen in the film.Brother number three Wenleung Jack Gao suffered mental problems as a direct result of the war and is bedridden at a local hospital. Amazingly he recovers enough to deal with Shanghai drug smugglers but is framed as a Japanese collaborator and after being beaten in prison loses his mental balance again. The fourth Lin brother Wenching is deaf and runs a photography studio. Wenching is involved with young antigovernment socialists such as his friend Hinoe Wu Yifang who is forced to flee to the mountains to join the guerillas.

That makes this film believable and compared to others very unique.Normally you would have a narrator who is telling you the story from his point of view. Now i don't want to say that i dismiss this way of narration but A city of sadness does not need such a narrator in fact it would shatter the special specific atmosphere of this movie if that would be the case. Without definitive narrative elements the staging normally involves narrationmusicDP etc the viewer gets the feeling that he is able to see for himself what the lives of those people were like when WWII ended. It is fascinating to witness how this very sober staging is still able to evoke strong emotions within the viewer. This is due to the directors vision but also to the cast which did an amazing job.It was also very clever to have the deaf WenCh'ing as the main character so the viewer can sympathize with him very easily like WenCh'ing the viewer is kind of caught up within the political turbulence and is not to able react like he would want because he is mute ... and is therefore not able to speak up in a loud voice to stop the violence. He is forced to watch.Even today the topic TaiwanChina isn't solved at all. After watching this film people will surely get a better understanding why the struggle between China and Taiwan is so filled with anger sadness fury ...so ... that's definitely a mustsee!! ".

Although this makes the experience sometimes frustrating the miracle is that it never detracts from the gut feeling I have had from the very first viewing that I am watching a masterpiece. An ambitious attempt to capture the immediate post second world war period of Taiwanese history by following the members of one family through fragments of their daily lives rather than a carefully constructed continuous narrative Hou's work resonates with tremendous feeling. As is usual with this director the audience has to work hard to supply connections in a film without joins in order to understand who is who and what is actually going on. I have to admit that some of the scenes of gang violence still elude me but these apart the light is beginning to shine through. It is clear that the old man with the beret who sits often staring vacantly is the owner of that densely furnished restaurant that he has four sons. The eldest the sturdy looking one seems perennially mixed up with figures of a gangster underworld the second has returned from the war mentally damaged the third did not return from active service in the Phillipines and is presumed dead. And then there is the youngest who has a photographer's studio and seems completely apart from the rest of the family by virtue of a sensitive gentle nature and the disability of complete deafness brought on by a childhood accident. It is his fortunes and those of the young nurse he eventually marries that provide the sense of audience empathy that even the most obscure cinema need in order to work its magic. Their scenes provide moments of great tenderness in a relationship that relies entirely for communication on the written note such as the occasion when she needs to tell him about the beauty of a German folksong that is being played. When the country is placed under repressive martial law with massed executions for dissenters we have snippets of the deaf mute's experiences. There is a particularly telling moment when he is in captivity unable to hear the sound of the firing squad from which he somehow mercifully escapes.

	schema:reviewBody "I'm having difficulties rating this film. I gave Hou's last film that I saw Dust in the Wind a 710 because I felt it was slight and sloppy but good nonetheless. CoS is even sloppier but it is not in any way slight. However when I'm desperately struggling to understand the film trying to identify characters and interpret events a lot of the power seeps away. I feel that the characterizations of DitW were more clear if again slight but CoS despite its apparent cast of hundreds I only identified with and could identify for the most part the two main characters. However I really did end up loving them and was very affected by everything that happened to them. Luckily as the film progresses it becomes less about everyone and everything else and focuses on those two characters entering the genre of such films as The Unbearable Lightness of Being and Doctor Zhivago i.e. movies where war is examined from the point of view of those who want desperately to live and love without hinderance but keep getting pulled into the conflict. Still the first three quarters of the film are very loose. I found myself saying often I can't recognize a single individual in this scene. I also kept coming back to the idea that this story would make a much better novel than a film. In a novel it's much easier to follow the action.While Hou's narrative is still poorly devised he wasn't the screenwriter anyways his cinematic technique is improving by leaps and bounds as I go from one film to the next. His shot composition utilizes depth to a great extent. We often see the action from a distance and he uses the technique of blocking putting characters and objects in front of the main action to astonishing effectiveness. It makes us feel helpless in many of the more painful scenes.SLIGHT SPOILER There's at least one amazing edit to which I have to call attention the characters are all at a funeral and then there is a cut to an extreme long shot which encompasses a whole small peninsula of Taiwan with the vast ocean behind it. In the distance we see and hear a procession. I assumed it was a funeral procession but the next scene reveals that it was a marriage procession a marriage that I was beginning to doubt was ever going to happen. The funeral scene and wedding scene are masterfully connected with the intricate Buddhist ceremonies and the emotional effects of this juxtaposition is marvelous. One more master scene that I have to point out is one where the deaf character forgive me but I tend to mix Asian names up and I don't even want to try is in prison and soldiers take away two of his cellmates. We see a medium closeup of the deaf man and we hear two shots. I cringed but of course the character doesn't react because he can't hear them. The implications of that left me shivering.END SPOILER So what am I going to give it a 7 or an 8? I choose 7 but with the stipulation that I want to come back to it someday in the future to see if I can comprehend the narrative better. It's certainly a fine film but I do feel justified in my complaints. There's also the fact that as this is a foreign film and it has a lot of dialogue I'm so busy reading the subtitles that it is easy to miss who is who. One thing I don't want to hear from people is how important the events depicted are for Taiwan. That doesn't matter. I'm criticizing a film here not history.".

	onyx:emotionText "I'm having difficulties rating this film. I gave Hou's last film that I saw Dust in the Wind a 710 because I felt it was slight and sloppy but good nonetheless. CoS is even sloppier but it is not in any way slight. However when I'm desperately struggling to understand the film trying to identify characters and interpret events a lot of the power seeps away. I feel that the characterizations of DitW were more clear if again slight but CoS despite its apparent cast of hundreds I only identified with and could identify for the most part the two main characters. However I really did end up loving them and was very affected by everything that happened to them. Luckily as the film progresses it becomes less about everyone and everything else and focuses on those two characters entering the genre of such films as The Unbearable Lightness of Being and Doctor Zhivago i.e. movies where war is examined from the point of view of those who want desperately to live and love without hinderance but keep getting pulled into the conflict. Still the first three quarters of the film are very loose. I found myself saying often I can't recognize a single individual in this scene. I also kept coming back to the idea that this story would make a much better novel than a film. In a novel it's much easier to follow the action.While Hou's narrative is still poorly devised he wasn't the screenwriter anyways his cinematic technique is improving by leaps and bounds as I go from one film to the next. His shot composition utilizes depth to a great extent. We often see the action from a distance and he uses the technique of blocking putting characters and objects in front of the main action to astonishing effectiveness. It makes us feel helpless in many of the more painful scenes.SLIGHT SPOILER There's at least one amazing edit to which I have to call attention the characters are all at a funeral and then there is a cut to an extreme long shot which encompasses a whole small peninsula of Taiwan with the vast ocean behind it. In the distance we see and hear a procession. I assumed it was a funeral procession but the next scene reveals that it was a marriage procession a marriage that I was beginning to doubt was ever going to happen. The funeral scene and wedding scene are masterfully connected with the intricate Buddhist ceremonies and the emotional effects of this juxtaposition is marvelous. One more master scene that I have to point out is one where the deaf character forgive me but I tend to mix Asian names up and I don't even want to try is in prison and soldiers take away two of his cellmates. We see a medium closeup of the deaf man and we hear two shots. I cringed but of course the character doesn't react because he can't hear them. The implications of that left me shivering.END SPOILER So what am I going to give it a 7 or an 8?

This film totally enlightened me! This poetic masterpiece changed the way I view cinema. This film which deals with modernity of Taiwan feels more like a Confucian ritual an ancestral rite of some sort. And at the same time like many of Hou Hsiaohsien's other films this movie deals with the theme of 'growth'. Hou seems to tell us over and over again that growth is learning to say goodbye to the things we love. One beautiful movie. I strongly recommend it to the cinephiles who haven't yet tasted this great cinematic treat.".

Basically it takes place during a crucial moment in Taiwanese history between 1945 Emperor Hirohito announces Japan's surrender following 50 years of Japanese colonial rule and the arrival of Chiang KaiShek's Nationalists four years later. Set in a coastal town not far from Taipei it depicts the experiences of the Lin family specifically in the lives of four brothers during the February 28 Incident. The eldest brother Wenheung Sung Young Chen is a translator he awaits the birth of his child and begins trading in the postwar black market. The second middle brother Wenleung Jack Kao is a soldier he suffers a traumatic brain injury whilst in prison during the war and is thought to have died in the Philippines. The youngest brother Wenching Tony Leung Chiu Wai who is both deaf and mute works as a photographer he suffers a nervous breakdown in Shanghai. With the brothers getting involved with complex issues including drug dealers the authorities and leftist guerrillas of the time it will all inevitably end in the family's destruction. It is a simple of a troubled family that will all make choices that will lead to tragedy I got confused whether there were three or four brothers and it did get confusing when having to also read subtitles but the scenery was nice to look at and it certainly look authentic with the setting an interesting enough historical drama.

	schema:reviewBody "the way this film was written it was simply not enough to keep me glued to the screen. Director and writer was Bernd Bhlich who has worked a lot with Horst Krause in the past another one of my favorite German actors. Bhlich and Thalbach worked together one year earlier on Du bist nicht allein and it seems that it was fruitful enough for the two to make another film right away.Sadly this film suffered from several very questionable screenplay decisions. One would be when Thalbach's character steals the info book about Pakistan without even knowing where her love interest comes from and despite seemingly having enough money to actually pay for it. The next would be the marriage to the guy she absolutely feels nothing for. That was so random really and as she plays a pretty tough woman I don't believe she would have ever agreed to that. Of course she was equally fragile. In one scene early on we see many cardboard boxes in her room with the description fragile and that fits her too. I actually liked that shot maybe my favorite from the film. However she is a woman who also manages life on her own. She has done so for many years and she does so after the death of her younger daughter too. There is two scenes when her future husband holds open the front of her car so she can look what is wrong with it and she holds the front open herself as well to show the audience she does not need a man to do so for her.Fritzi Haberlandt and Birol nel Soul Kitchen play smaller characters in this film and I would have actually liked to see more from them as both are pretty talented. It's really all about Thalbach's character. One scene that did not work out so well is the one where she and her daughter discuss the daughter's wish to drive her mom's car right before she dies. It's a nice reference to the mom's guilt in what happened afterward but this scene just seemed so insignificant compared to what it could have been.Anyway I was a bit disappointed with the overall outcome. It puts lots of lovers jobs and relationships in the film all closely connected to Thalbach's character but maybe sometimes less can be more and this also applies to this movie. The ending was okay though and made a nice difference from all the heavy topics before that unrequited love jobfinancial troubles death illness...".

	schema:reviewBody "The major disadvantage when recommending this film to someone is that it's practically impossible to describe! It's easy enough to say what it isn't it's not a detective story and it's certainly not a thriller despite the fact that it nominally revolves around an unsolved crime. It's not a warstory despite the fact that it is set immediately before DDay and the main characters are intimately involved in the war effort. It's not a romance despite the fact that two of the characters have an unhappy lovestory. And it's not the Chaucerian epic one might be led to expect by the title and the opening scene  although by the end the pilgrimage allusions turn out to be rather more strangely apt then they at first appear.The only word I can find to give a flavour of this story is that it is above all English  as English as Ealing comedy without the comedy as Miss Marple without the murder as Elizabeth Goudge without the magic... and yet again I find myself defining it by what it isn't! It's English in a way that is quietly deeply antithetical to the frenetic posturing of 'Cool Britannia'. It is as English as the haze over the long grass beneath the trees of a summer meadow as polished brass and a whiff of steam as the express pulls up at a country halt as church bells drifting in snatches on a lazy breeze and the taste of blackberries in the sun.It's almost impossible now to comprehend that the 1940s countryside in which this film is set was really there that it was not the Second World War but its crippling aftermath that industrialised farms banished the horsedrawn vehicles from the wheelwright's and exchanged towering haywains for silage towers. Britain was determined never to starve again  and so the world that had once differed so little from that of Chaucer's time was swept away beyond recall. When it was made this film was no more a rustic period piece than 'Passport to Pimlico' a few years later was an urban social documentary. Subsequent events have preserved both in mute evidence of contemporary communities that are almost unbelievable today.It is perhaps fair therefore to assume that the type of viewer who will watch 'Battlefield Earth' is unlikely to find this film anything other than silly parochial and ultimately dull! Very little actually happens. The story is on occasion both humorous and poignant but what we at first assume to be the central plot turns out not to be the point at all. The triple denouement is set up so gently and skilfully that we too are taken by miraculous surprise with the true shape of the film only evident in retrospect.It is ultimately a story about faith and miracles and pilgrimages even in the thenmodern world of shopgirls lumbermen and cinema organists  and if that idea in itself sounds enough to put you off as I confess it would have done for me before I watched it myself then I will gladly add that it is a film about beauty and hope and unexpected friendship and laughter and technically very accomplished to boot. The use of black and white is glorious ranging from the glimmer in the obscurest of shadows to sundrenched hillside and the totally unselfconscious reference to Chaucer in the opening sequence is in these days worth the price of admission alone.If you like gentle films  sweetnatured films  films with a deep affection for their subject  films that make you laugh and cry but always smile  then I urge you not on any account to miss this one. If for the moment you require thrills spills forbidden passions and lastminute rescues then pass it by and let it go on its tranquil way. When you are old and grey and full of sleep this unassuming classic will still be there waiting...".

Plot and narrative drive is foregone the quest for the 'glueman' is simply a device to bring the characters together and instead is created an ode to the spritual in man as necessary in wartime as at any other time. Three young and diverse persons arrive by train in Kent when about to go their separate midnight ways the female in their company has glue poured in her hair by an unseen assailant. For the rest of the film they pool resources to discover the wrongdoer while finding themselves sucked in by the countryside of England and the lure of Canterbury. The film is flawed but only with the flaws of one you love the casting notably the American soldier is frequently untrained and the dialogue doesn't always hit the poetic heights of the visuals but these are asides and nothing more than asides because away from being the greatest essay in visual poetry Britain has ever produced the film whispers also profound things about modern day life about our links with the past about the essential oneness of all life. In the Canterbury showdown all wishes come true and all hearts are filled and that's as it should be for a film which is at heart a children's story for grownups but there was never a necessity for the film's ends to be tied it's a beautiful dream rather than a drama. One has to remind oneself at the end that no actually this isn't how people always are that life isn't always like this and that is a measure of the film's success.".

For me cinema can't provide much more. As the movie seems to meander along it is actually picking up an enormous head of steam which willat the endlet loose a blast of patriotism pride beauty sound architecture and spirituality. Regarding the latter I do not refer to the fact that the finale is set in a cathedralas beautiful and symbolic as this one may be. This film rises above any stricture of creed because of the honest humanism of its creators. This is a war film as it appears from the view of civilians who remain at home. Among other things it shows that while a civilian population in wartime must give up a great deal the rewards can be commensurate. Concerning Iraq this is something Americans at home have not yet begun to learn or do. This astonishing film stands after more than sixty years as one of those rewards.".

	schema:reviewBody "A wonderful film as you might expect from the cinema's greatest directorial duo. It's unique in mood and pace amongst the many Archers films that I've seen. The others move at a brisk pace going from one plot element to the next. No harm in that of course. It works very well for films like One of Our Aircraft Is Missing I Know Where I'm Going! A Matter of Life and Death and the others. A Canterbury Tale on the other hand stops and smells the roses as it leisurely  and semiplotlessly  strolls through the English countryside on the trail to Canterbury Cathedral. Three young people an American G.I. named Bob Johnson Seargant John Sweet a British soldier Peter Gibbs Dennis Price and a young woman from London Alison Smith Sheila Sim moving to the countryside for work. The all arrive in the small town of Kent on the same train and they walk together trying to find the hotel. An assailant pops out of nowhere in the impenetrable dark and throws glue all over Alison's hair. Over the next few days they look for the Glueman. The film doesn't always work especially concerning the Glueman subplot which almost seems like it is the plot for most of the movie. The investigation and solution are the weakest scenes in the film. But there are dozens of gorgeous sequences within the film. I especially love the sequence with the children playing war. The film gets especially good during its extended finale where the three actually four main characters go to Canterbury and their pilgrimages pay off. The three leads are excellent. The fourth main character the magistrate of Kent Thomas Colpeper Eric Portman is the weakest and I'd just rather forget his role in the film myself. Perhaps he will work better in subsequent viewings. The best aspect of the film is its top shelf cinematography maybe the best black and white that I've seen from the Archers. A lot of the scenes take place ingeniously in total darkness. These work so much better than imaginable! 910.".

An assailant pops out of nowhere in the impenetrable dark and throws glue all over Alison's hair. Over the next few days they look for the Glueman. The film doesn't always work especially concerning the Glueman subplot which almost seems like it is the plot for most of the movie. The investigation and solution are the weakest scenes in the film. But there are dozens of gorgeous sequences within the film. I especially love the sequence with the children playing war. The film gets especially good during its extended finale where the three actually four main characters go to Canterbury and their pilgrimages pay off. The three leads are excellent. The fourth main character the magistrate of Kent Thomas Colpeper Eric Portman is the weakest and I'd just rather forget his role in the film myself. Perhaps he will work better in subsequent viewings. The best aspect of the film is its top shelf cinematography maybe the best black and white that I've seen from the Archers. A lot of the scenes take place ingeniously in total darkness. These work so much better than imaginable! 910.";

'A Canterbury Tale' is a British wartime film appealing directly to the newlyarrived American allies to regard the sight of an English Cathedral spire an old pilgrim road or clear skies over chalky uplands as worth fighting to preserve. A victory for our enemies it seems to say would mean an end to this spiritual continuity and the heavy burden of defending it had fallen to us and our Comrades. Thus the film can be taken on one level as a straightforward flagwaver.But it is clearly more than this. The opening of the film quoting loosely from Geoffrey Chaucer depicts a medieval pilgrimage the old Canterbury Pilgrims journeying to receive blessings or do penance. Fastforward to wartime and a different kind of pilgrim walks the way.

Powell and Pressburger take their time in spinning their story but it's time we don't mind spending in Chillingbourne wending our way with Alison and the farm cart blackberrying on the Weald with Peter and Bob chewing the fat with the locals getting to know our pilgrims' histories and ultimately solving the Glue Man crimes. There are many meandering diversions along this particular road and some bits of business are downright peculiar the silhouetted village idiot scene and the young boys' playfight spring to mind. But by degrees the film's narrative themes begin to coalesce and slowly we are taken somewhere very special indeed.It's true Thomas Colpeper  gentleman farmer and magistrate  is something of an oddity but no small town is complete without its eccentric. There's a magnetic and sympathetic quality about him too as we see when Alison bitterly comments on her prospective InLaws' refusal to accept she's good enough for their son 'It would take an earthquake' she says to which Colpeper calmly replies 'We're having one.' As played by Eric Portman he is at once coolly beguiling and strangely malevolent. His unmasking by our protagonists as the 'Glue Man' comes as no real surprise but seemingly his motivation is only about assuring our connection with the land and its history despite being himself irredeemably misogynistic to our modern eyes.The final act as the foursome complete their pilgrimages to Canterbury on the iron road is a revelation As they and we are propelled closer to the imposing Cathedral the characters' stories are completed Colpeper is set to do penance by turning himself in to the Police Peter is told he was the instrument for this but instead gets a blessing of his own Bob finally receives his girl's letters posted from Australia She's joined the WACs! and Alison is similarly blessed. Her scene in Mr Portal's Garage is especially moving as the burden she carries is the hardest  the presumed death of her airman fianc. Her barelyaudible 'Why?' whispered in disbelief when told Master Geoffrey's father has waited with news for her for two weeks delivers a moving emotional payoff. Sheila Sim  now Lady Attenborough  gives a memorably natural performance throughout.The film's luminous black and white photography is strong as is the location work in and around the recentlybombed Canterbury and the use of music throughout adds a spiritual element to the visuals. My Favourite scene? The steamhauled commuter train bearing our pilgrims from Chillingbourne pulls into Canterbury station and Peter stands in the compartment to adjust his uniform collar. Apparently he's been the unwitting but skeptical instrument of Colpeper's penance and his line 'I'll believe that when I see a halo around my head' comes as the carriage window behind him is suddenly bathed in blinding morning sunlight.

	schema:reviewBody "This superb allegory by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger follows the pilgrimages of three disparate people during WW II as they make their way to Canterbury along the 600yearold Pilgrims Path. Each is seeking a miracle or consolation from their journey.Alison Sheila Sim is a London shop girl who ventures to the English countryside to work on a farm as a land girl and to revisit the spot where she vacationed with her now dead soldier boyfriend. Bob John Sweet is a naive American GI who's girlfriend back in Oregon has stopped writing to him. He told his mother he'd visit Canterbury. Peter Dennis Price is a disillusioned organist whose career has been limited to playing in movie theaters and who is soon to ship out overseas.The three disembark a train together and venture toward the great cathedral city when Alison is attacked in the dark by a strange offender known locally as the glue man. He's poured nasty glue all over her head. As the three find lodgings and talk to locals they learn that the glue man has struck many other times.Alison settles into her farm job while Bob discovers the countryside still in 1944 very much tied to 19thcentury ways. Peter tries to find out more about the glue man. They all meet a local eccentric Eric Portman who may be the glue man. He lectures locally on the rewards of country life and works as a magistrate in Canterbury. They all meet at the cathedral as they meet their fates.Absolutely gorgeous BW photography lovingly displays the beautiful countryside with ample shots of wide sky and billowing fields rustic farms and buildings and always Canterbury in the background.The simple story lines are set against the complex allegory of a journey of discovery. Each of the pilgrims finds something in Canterbury but what happens to them afterwards is left to our imagination. Both Alison and Bob find answers to their private sorrows and Peter attains a cherished dream. All three are changed in deep and moving ways.John Sweet was an amateur actor stationed with the US Army in England when he was discovered for this role. His plainspoken American is both naive and deeply wise. His growing love of the countryside and the old ways is infectious. Sheila Sim plays a sturdy and practical girl who deals with her loss while loving her new life in the country. Dennis Price plays the most complicated character since his loss is more a loss of ambition and opportunity than a loss of human love. His discovery at the cathedral is very moving. Portman is a lonely and aging man who may be attracted to Alison as a kindred spirit but all paths do not lead to the same destination.Many notable actors in small parts include Edward Rigby Charles Hawtrey Hay Petrie Freda Jackson Esma Cannon Graham Moffatt Eliot Makeham Esmond Knight and Judith Furse.Powell and Pressburger scored a major success with this moving and seemingly simple story. But the characters will stay with you long after watching this glorious masterpiece.".

Yes he's vaguely sinister but he provides the glue that diverts the film's younger warpreoccupied characters from their immediate concerns and he suggests the clues that connect them to the heritage some of us Yanks know the words of 'Land Of Hope And Glory' because EnglandBritain is undeniably in many respects our Mother Country that has shaped them and made them who they are  and to the Civilization for which they're fighting.Too many of today's critics obsess about the Lesbian farm woman whose character in the 1940's would have been ordinary and been regarded as being ordinary a woman raised under the sterner discipline and mores of her day with nononsense nob.s. values of virtue obligation and hard work  and of getting to the point. It's postmodernists' affectation to automatically suspect doughty matteroffact women characters  any eccentric women characters whom their postmodernist Miss Jean Brodie nonsense has bent them to suspect of fitting their screwy postmodernist i.e. most often Marxisant but often also Romantic worldview  in earlier films of being Lesbians. This woman is consummately a farmer who has to consider pragmatically what all farmers have always had to consider how to smartly efficiently work their land to its top yield against time and weather pests and parasites poachers and market conditions there's nothing Lesbian about any of her singleminded agrarian pragmatism or about her unremarkable  for her day  country ladies' sartorial choice or even about her puffing a cigarette.'A Canterbury Tale' isn't among the best of Powell  Pressburger's efforts but it doesn't fall far short of their best. In a spot or two the plot plods but then plodding was the pace of the Kentish countryside so I think that it's only to our early third millennium sensibilities that it seems to plod. Seldom has black  white cinematography managed as it manages here to communicate through chiaroscuro the pilgrims' unease and through the blessed splendor of sunlit cloudgarlanded vistas of the Weald of Kent their respite.As the Glueman strives to communicate the pace sensibilities and sensations of Chaucer's pilgrim's time so too must we latterday viewers accommodate our viewing of this film to the pace sensibilities and sensations of its period and setting once we've done that  which demands of us no extraordinary effort  the legendary enduring Powell  Pressburger magic works its spell.From the outset I found Sergeant Sweet's unaffected acting wellsuited to the storytelling. The Yanks whom Wartime Britons recall were probably more like Mike Roczinsky yet among those overpaid overfed oversexed and over here American invaders among all those brown jobs were young men quite like Sweet's Bob Johnson. Dennis Price's manner is a bit too aristocratic for his portrayal of a sergeant but on the whole Price's thespian gifts help him to carry off his role very well. Sheila Sim gives a perfectly iconic portrayal of a young woman of her time bereaved but not crushed proud yet considerate tender yet not mawkish vulnerable yet capable. Eric Portman's Glueman is appropriately mysterious and mildly menacing and yet in the ending we discover that he's all along been a benign agent of illumination the neutral but never indifferent catalyst the benevolent spur to the young people's sleuthing to know their present through their coming to touch their collective past the Glueman is if you think about his role in the narrative rather Godlike  or if your prefer rather Naturelike.What's lovely about the dnouement here is that it enchants without indulging in sodden kitschiness and indeed that it enchants in spite of of its scant kitschy elements. In the end the Glueman vanishes from the pilgrim's and our ken because he's accomplished his task of cluing and gluing the pilgrims to their past to the mystical dimension of Being in their Own Time as that Being can only have come about by dint of their having touched their Past in their Present which is the predicate of their harboring good hope for their Future. This message to people whom wartime exigencies shifted brusquely about en masse as people had hitherto never shifted about may have rung in 'A Canterbury Tale's' contemporary audiences a chord of sentimental longing and welcome reassurance.This is a thoroughly English film best appreciated when one knows that Powell grew up in rural Kent and that he loved his home county's loveliness as only a native can and does love eternally his childhood home  and the verities it imparts early to him. In our present age of rapidly successive plugin and plugout residential and professional transience  the first age of nighuniversal human rootlessness  'A Canterbury Tale's' blessing is its acquainting us with our 1940's forebears' more permanent more grounded sense of themselves and their place in the world and in time a sense which they felt the war had put under threat and had hurled them and their world willynilly into unsettling uncertainty. It seems unlikely that we  our species  shall ever again know the quiet certainties tranquility and satisfaction of lifelong residence in or near our birthplaces. Until our time urgency meant for people something quite different from what urgency means for us. If people before our hyperactive attentiondeficited more artificial time were not more authentic then they were certainly far less remote than we've become from Nature's cycles and temper.'A Canterbury Tale's' charm is quiet subtle and in the end it's sensual mystical illuminating and eternally dear.

	schema:reviewBody "When Stanley Kubrick cut from a flying bone to a spaceship in 2001 A Space Oddysey it would be widely credited as the best cut in cinema history. What isn't so well known is that it is an almost direct steal from this much earlier Powell and Pressburger picture. Granted in A Canterbury Tale the cut does not take in the whole sweep of human history  it cuts from a medieval hunter's hawk to a Second World War fighter plane  but in my opinion it achieves the same affect much more smoothly than in the later film.A Canterbury Tale cannot easily be slotted into one genre. It is unusual in that it was a contemporary set film made during the war but it does not have a war theme  it records normal life during wartime. It's ironic perhaps that a section in which two gangs of boys play act a battle with toy guns is staged exactly like a proper action scene with rousing musical underscoring. There is a rather bizarre central storyline concerning the hunt for a man who pours glue over the heads of women who date soldiers but this is just a red herring. The real story is about the journey of selfdiscovery undertaken by the central characters  a land girl a GI a tank commander and a village historian  and the people they meet along the way.In some ways the film can also be regarded as a look at English ways of life from the point of view of a foreigner  screenwriter Pressburger was Hungarian. Dozens of bit part characters  each uniquely interesting and many of them funny  walk on and off. It shows quirkiness resilience a sense of history differences and similarities between city people and country folk and also the differences and similarities between the English residents and US soldiers. As such it can be considered a kind of propaganda piece albeit a very unconventional one.The best acting performances in the film also belong to the actors in smaller parts. Particularly memorable is Esmond Knight in duel roles as a deadpan cockney soldier and a stuttering village idiot. As for the lead roles nonprofessional John Sweet is good as the good natured American soldier Bob Johnson but I find leading lady Sheila Sim's ultra posh voice a little grating.Despite what is apparently a fairly mundane setting there is no shortage of spectacular images in A Canterbury Tale. Creating such images was Powell's greatest strength. There is the opening closeup of the Canterbury cathedral bells which pans to a shot of the city through a fleurdelis shaped aperture. There is the shot of Culpepper silhouetted against a spotlight as he delivers his lecture. Throughout the cinematography is excellent with lots of light and shadow making the most of the black and white photography.A Canterbury Tale has to be one of the most unique and difficult to describe pictures of its era but it is a good one. It is endlessly entertaining and often heartwarming. It is brilliantly directed  I'd say the best of Michael Powell's monochrome pictures. Well worth seeking out especially if you've already seen and enjoyed a few Powell and Pressburger flicks.".

All the characters are done beautifully and represent truly credible and creditable members of their respective backgrounds whether British or American town or country people. It is impossible to choose favorites among them as Eric Sheila John and Dennis all act with great understanding and competence.The camaraderie between three and later four of them is touching beyond words. The scenes with the American sergeant and the children are flawless. And the setting is just what I wish to live in as Allison says I would give anything to grow old there.I wondered about the things I saw in the sky in one scene and am indebted to another reviewer who said they were actual wartime blimps. Fantastic! It's a wonder that the filmmakers managed to film on enough days when there was no bombing although as it was 1944 by then I guess it had slowed down somewhat. The immediacy of events was further shown by the sad sights Allison saw in Canterbury  the bombedout buildings.The mystical element is handled so gently and gracefully that it can almost be missed at certain times but it is an integral part of the film so I hope everyone watches this movie closely.Well I can't say any more without giving it away but suffice it to say it was a most satisfying experience. It was fully as moving in its own quiet way as In Which We Serve the rightly celebrated action film of the same period. English people should be proud of this beautiful paean to their best qualities.".

	schema:dateCreated "Thu Aug 14 2008 00:00:00 GMT+0200 (Central European Summer Time)";
	schema:headline " A lyrical masterpiece about places and people";
	schema:reviewBody "There are a number of ways that you can interpret A Canterbury Tale 1944 and a number of things to look out for in order to enrich the overall experience. For me it remains one of the finest British films of the last halfcentury mixing elements of satire detective fiction romance and magicalrealism to create a lingering and atmospheric work that forgoes any such generic storytelling concerns and indeed the more recognisable ideas of narrative to instead create an experience for the viewer that works simply as a result of the feeling that is created by the contrast between the characters and the subject matter. On an entirely immediate level the film can be seen as subtle comment on the futility of war an idea given a greater sense of creative credence by the fact that it was produced at a time when the war was still raging. As ever Powell and Pressburger go against the accepted grain of the era relinquishing any obvious elements of propaganda as they did quite controversially with their preceding film the equally satirical The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp 1943 and producing a film that on the one hand seems to be a laboured attempt to smooth out relations between American and British troops in the run up to the Normandy invasion while on the other hand offering a ironic comment on the nature of war and that air of unspoken tragedy that punctuates the drama and makes the destruction and the devastation of war comprehendible on an entirely personal level.In keeping with this notion the only battles shown in the film are those that involve the children of the village acting out the supposed thrill of the battle in such a way as to make light of the inherent absurdities and childishness of it all. Likewise the ending of the film which seems to suggest the noble spirit of war with its Onward Christian Soldiers and the allusions to the Canterbury Pilgrims  as uniformed men and boys march in procession through the streets  also ties in with the propaganda element and yet features a subtlesubversion on this same theme in a way that may have been missed by the majority of viewers at the time the film was released. Through Powell and Pressburger deny us the sight of any actual combat they don't shy away from showing us the aftermath of the battle with the sequences set within Canterbury itself making great use of the recent destruction of the Baedeker Raids of May and June 1942 which itself suggests another theme of the film in the idea of history or indeed conservation. The film in both design and presentation is a veritable ode to the wonders of nature and the glorious pastoral landscapes of rural England rich in atmosphere and history. Again it is that universal connection to time and place that binds the characters beyond the recognisable differences of nationality gender and generation informing the tone of the narrative and suggesting a further interpretation pertaining to the past and of letting go of the past and embracing the present.These ideas are expressed most clearly in the character of the American soldier played here by the reallife U.S. Sgt. John Sweet with his slow Dylan likedrawl and keen delivery going towards the creation of a character that is honest and entirely genuine in his thoughts. The filmmakers exploit the character and his relationship between the rest of the cast to make light of both the inherent differences and indeed similarities between the two cultures in a way that is beneficial to the plot. Regardless there is a real sense of warmth to the presentation of this character due in part to the naturalistic performance from Sweet and the natural charm of the dialog. Unlike many popular presentations of Americans  particular American soldiers of this era  he is sensitive sympathetic dynamic attuned to his surroundings and quietly heroic on an entirely personal level. Again he is perfectly counted by the fine performances of Eric Portman Dennis Price and the lovely Sheila Sim who round out the cast with aplomb. There's also a great sense of warmth and pathos to these characters moving from moments of light comedy to more affecting moments of drama and intuitive character observation as we return to that idea of the past and how the location binds the characters regardless of their superficial differences.Throughout the film the characters cling to old memories of people and places never realising that there are experiences to be cherished in the here and now even more so given the life and death implications of the war itself. These are incredibly weighty ideas being expressed in a film that was no doubt considered to be a silly little wartime romp when originally released but can now be seen as one of the finest most intelligent and repeatedly rewarding films ever released. Admittedly it won't be to all tastes as is often the case with the films of Powell and Pressburger there is no set genre here with the reliance on character and atmosphere leading us away from such notions and instead towards something that can only be experienced. It is a film that relies mostly on the feeling that is transmitted between the film and the viewer and will be considered a success or a failure depending on how it leaves the audience with that final shot of the chiming bells of Canterbury Cathedral. You could perhaps argue that it lacks the imagination or epicspectacle of the later films like A Matter of Life and Death 1946 or The Red Shoes 1948  still two of the greatest works of British cinema  but in my opinion A Canterbury Tale remains a minor masterpiece in its own right and seems to be something of a thematic companion piece to director Michael Powell's earlier work The Edge of the World 1937.".

	onyx:emotionText "There are a number of ways that you can interpret A Canterbury Tale 1944 and a number of things to look out for in order to enrich the overall experience. For me it remains one of the finest British films of the last halfcentury mixing elements of satire detective fiction romance and magicalrealism to create a lingering and atmospheric work that forgoes any such generic storytelling concerns and indeed the more recognisable ideas of narrative to instead create an experience for the viewer that works simply as a result of the feeling that is created by the contrast between the characters and the subject matter. On an entirely immediate level the film can be seen as subtle comment on the futility of war an idea given a greater sense of creative credence by the fact that it was produced at a time when the war was still raging. As ever Powell and Pressburger go against the accepted grain of the era relinquishing any obvious elements of propaganda as they did quite controversially with their preceding film the equally satirical The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp 1943 and producing a film that on the one hand seems to be a laboured attempt to smooth out relations between American and British troops in the run up to the Normandy invasion while on the other hand offering a ironic comment on the nature of war and that air of unspoken tragedy that punctuates the drama and makes the destruction and the devastation of war comprehendible on an entirely personal level.In keeping with this notion the only battles shown in the film are those that involve the children of the village acting out the supposed thrill of the battle in such a way as to make light of the inherent absurdities and childishness of it all. Likewise the ending of the film which seems to suggest the noble spirit of war with its Onward Christian Soldiers and the allusions to the Canterbury Pilgrims  as uniformed men and boys march in procession through the streets  also ties in with the propaganda element and yet features a subtlesubversion on this same theme in a way that may have been missed by the majority of viewers at the time the film was released. Through Powell and Pressburger deny us the sight of any actual combat they don't shy away from showing us the aftermath of the battle with the sequences set within Canterbury itself making great use of the recent destruction of the Baedeker Raids of May and June 1942 which itself suggests another theme of the film in the idea of history or indeed conservation. The film in both design and presentation is a veritable ode to the wonders of nature and the glorious pastoral landscapes of rural England rich in atmosphere and history. Again it is that universal connection to time and place that binds the characters beyond the recognisable differences of nationality gender and generation informing the tone of the narrative and suggesting a further interpretation pertaining to the past and of letting go of the past and embracing the present.These ideas are expressed most clearly in the character of the American soldier played here by the reallife U.S. Sgt. John Sweet with his slow Dylan likedrawl and keen delivery going towards the creation of a character that is honest and entirely genuine in his thoughts. The filmmakers exploit the character and his relationship between the rest of the cast to make light of both the inherent differences and indeed similarities between the two cultures in a way that is beneficial to the plot. Regardless there is a real sense of warmth to the presentation of this character due in part to the naturalistic performance from Sweet and the natural charm of the dialog. Unlike many popular presentations of Americans  particular American soldiers of this era  he is sensitive sympathetic dynamic attuned to his surroundings and quietly heroic on an entirely personal level. Again he is perfectly counted by the fine performances of Eric Portman Dennis Price and the lovely Sheila Sim who round out the cast with aplomb.

But it takes more than a cursory glance to see something more than just eccentricity in this sample of 1940's life in a small Kentish village. This film is about something more than forgotten village life or Home Front life or a Land Girl or a subtle romance or soldiers in wartime. It's about something more than a connection to the land or the past or religion. It's a complete bubble in time but which has meaning and which transcends 'period' clothing and black and white photography and stiff accents.The small pleasures of the film build progressively with the charm of the locale to invite you in to make you care what happens to the lead characters.

'Kwaidan' is one of those rare movies that leaves you stunned the first time you see it.  For me it's equal to 'Rashomon' 'Woman In The Dunes' and 'Branded To Kill' as the most amazing Japanese movies I've ever seen. Each one of these movies blew my mind.

A blind priest is summoned by the ghosts of dead warriors to recite the heroic battle that cost them their lives. A samurai is taunted by ghosts in his cup of tea...Kobayashi's output has been small compared to his contemporaries' Kurosawa Ozu... yet each of his films is an assault on the senses and a visual gem. After unleashing some of Japan's cinematic legends in two of the greatest samurai films ever made Samurai Rebellion with Toshiro Mifune and the sublime Harakiri with Tatsuya Nakadai the master moved on to the supernatural with this collection of ghost stories.

A blind priest is summoned by the ghosts of dead warriors to recite the heroic battle that cost them their lives. A samurai is taunted by ghosts in his cup of tea...Kobayashi's output has been small compared to his contemporaries' Kurosawa Ozu... yet each of his films is an assault on the senses and a visual gem. After unleashing some of Japan's cinematic legends in two of the greatest samurai films ever made Samurai Rebellion with Toshiro Mifune and the sublime Harakiri with Tatsuya Nakadai the master moved on to the supernatural with this collection of ghost stories.

The execution was lowtech but it goes to show the power of human creativity before the age of fast computer chips.  This opening also sets the tone of what you are about to get into  a film of great visual beauty a film that requires a relaxed and unrushed mental frame of mind to appreciate.It consists of four stories all about ghosts spirits and a bloodsucking woman in white.

Parts of it may seem slow to some viewers and most of the stories are extremely predictable but I have to say this is one of the most beautiful haunting movies I've ever seen.Of all the stories I prefer Black Hair the first one.  Though a rather pointless horseback archery scene just slows it down it's by far the scariest and most nightmareworthy of the stories using sound to incredibly chilling effect.  There's more terror in the last minute of this segment than in all three Scream movies put together.  Trust me if you consider yourself a serious fan of horror cinema you have to see this. The second story The Woman of the Snow is good though I wish it ended more like Black Hair you'll see what I mean.  Hoichi the Earless with its jawdropping sea battle sequence is by far the biggest and most popular of the stories.  It's also the most influential with its main premise prominently reused in Conan the Barbarian.  The film ends with In a Cup of Tea.  This is the only story that doesn't completely telegraph its ending and coming after three utterly predictable stories its complexity is a bit unexpected and disorienting.  Certainly it's as creepy and beautiful as the rest of the film but I have to admit I don't really understand it.Being a tremendous fan of elegant understated horror movies as well as a student of Japanese culture I consider this film one of my alltime favorites.  Granted some viewers may be turned off by the leisurely pace and the theatrical intentionally unrealistic sets.  But this is undeniably a beautiful and chilling film absolutely perfect to watch late at night alone in the dark.".

	schema:reviewBody "The words beautiful lyrical and evocative aren't ones that you would normally attribute to a horror movie but they are precisely the ones that best describe Kwaidan a quintet of Samurai Gothics based interestingly enough on the writings of an American author by the name of Lafcadio Hearn. Shot in gorgeous sumptuous color way back in 1964 by director Masaki  Kobayashi Kwaidan is an unusual unique and quite extraordinary entry in the old horror anthology genre best represented by 1945's Dead of Night and Milton Subotsky's Amicus anthology series i.e. Dr. Terror's House of Horrors Tales From the Crypt  Asylum.Kwaidan differentiates itself from the pack in a number of significant ways. To begin with all of the episodes eschew the usual O. Henry twist endings and deliberately telegraph their punches case in point being Hoichi the Earless which gives away its climax with its very title! This film is also missing the compulsory wraparound story normally employed by anthology films to tie all the stories together and the horror elements are far more lowkey than most horror aficianados are used to. Kwaidan is far less concerned with springing shocks and fraying nerves than it is in exploring the whirlwind of conflicting emotions that swirl in the dark night of the human soul.The Black Hair is the tale of an impoverished samurai who abandons his loyal and loving wife to marry the daughter of a wealthy lord in another province only to discover many years later that he is still in love with his first spouse. He returns to their decaying old house to find her exactly as he left her affectionate and forgiving as could be. You know something in this household just ain't right. The Woman in the Snow concerns an apprentice woodcutter who encounters an eerily beautiful female icevampire  called a YukiOnna  who spares his life on the condition that he never tell a soul about their encounter. If you saw the last episode of the flaccid Tales From the Darkside movie on which this was based you have an idea of how this one ends.Hoichi the Earless easily the most powerful of the bunch regards a blind biwa a stringed instrument resembling a guitar player renowned for his moving rendition of the tragic tale of the battle between the Genji and Heiki clans. Each night he is summoned to the nearby graveyard to chant the epic tale for the  ghosts of the warriors who fell in that battle duped by the spirits into believing that he's performing in the home of a wealthy lord. When Hoichi disocvers that he has been decieved by the dead and refuses to perform for them again the ghosts exact a terrible revenge.A note of warning to those deterred by long foreign films this shimmering jewel in Japanese cinema's crown clocks in at nearly three hours of length  and is of course fully subtitled. Visually bold rich and color and texture  and atmospherically photographed with a spinetingling elegance I can't  guarantee that you'll like Kwaidan but I think that I can safely assure you'll never forget it. Highly recommended especially for Japanophiles and those with a taste for high class horror.".

	schema:reviewBody "Kwaidan is a foursegment horror anthology but you'd be hard pressed to find one more removed from the typical plastic bats and cobwebs Gothic anthologies of Amicus or Hammer. While it can be billed as a horror movie and it deals with the supernatural it's not really frightening. All four segments are more like traditional Japanese folk legends about ghosts the kind of spooky stories you could hear an elder narrating to kids around a bonfire in a village near Kyoto or the outskirts of Okinawa. However if work of art was a genre Kwaidan would be among the best it had to offer.Just two years after the seminal Seppuku which was done in stark black and white with a geometric well disciplined style Kobayashi returns with another tourdeforce this time in extravagant expressionistic colour. A visual feast proving that in the right hands style can be substance. His camera with its slow tracking shots is like a brush painting a celluloid canvas with vivid lush compositions and it comes as no surprise to find out that he had a background in painting. The combination of eerie supernatural material the dreamlike atmosphere and the use of colour in lighting and sets reminded me of the great Italian maestro Mario Bava although Kwaidan by no means fits in the Gothic horror mold. Conscious of the folk legend material he's working on Kobaysi wisely shot the movie in studio sets using large painted backgrounds that look deliberately artificial as much as they look gorgeous. In many ways it feels like a big stageplay or an elaborate dramatic poem. In that aspect Kwaidan takes place somewhere between the real and the mythic. A land of some other order. The stories all revolve around ghosts and are as simple and predictable as any spooky story that you might hear as an adult. But they do a great job of providing an eerie skeleton for Kobayashi to hang on his beautiful style. Style over substance one could argue. Isn't that an erroneous statement though? By making the distinction one implies that style is somehow insubstantial to a film something that couldn't be further from the truth. The use of colour is incredible the lighting at times subtle and evocative or wild and expressionistic the slow tracking shots long stretches of silence a body painted with holy text Tatsuya Nakadai looking calm and happy for a change Tetsuro Tamba in full plate samurai armor white ghastly faces bodies falling in bloodred waters a painted sunset backdrop an intelligent play on vague endings the minimal score chords echoing from somewhere. Kwaidan proves that style IS substance. A visual feast by all means.It's really a shame that Kobayashi is not as widely celebrated as Akira Kurosawa. Kwaidan is just another in a series of absolutely brilliant films he did in the 60's. Beautiful creepy poetic atmospheric as hell it is the work of a master cinematician and one of the best Japanese movies you're likely to see.".

It is clearly studiowork but Kobayashi turns that to his advance by making the most marvellous background paintings I've ever seen in a movie and his virtuosity comes to full exposure in the light effects that are fabulous for such an old film.  That together with the beautiful colors creates a mesmerizing and sometimes terrifying experience.  'Marco the magnificent' PatelliereHoward 1964 reminded me of the visuals in Kwaidan because of the beautiful environmental shots and because of the supposed history of mixture of eastern and western stories.  Forget that movie instantly plz. Another film that has nothing to do with this one but is brilliant and comparable only because of the episode structure the fairytale nature and great cinematography is Kaos Taviani 1984.Kwaidan has such a haunting effect because of the scary music and the sound effects are unnervingly edited.  Some call it horror.  I thought the pace was rather slow for horror but it is a film that does not let go easily. The actors one of which is Takeshi Shimura convince enthusiastically and they too make it an entertaining film.  According to the userrating this is Kobayashi's least interesting work of these three Joiuchi Seppuku and Kwaidan.  I can't wait to see the other two although I don't think they can surpass this masterpiece.10 points out of 10 ".

The actors one of which is Takeshi Shimura convince enthusiastically and they too make it an entertaining film.  According to the userrating this is Kobayashi's least interesting work of these three Joiuchi Seppuku and Kwaidan.  I can't wait to see the other two although I don't think they can surpass this masterpiece.10 points out of 10 ";

I think I have heard that Kobayashi was a painter. Even if I just made that up it would fit. The colors are godly. Any frame of the film is a masterful painting. If you are interested in composition and cinematography in film this is the one to see. If you only care about narrative read books. Don't watch films. But at least see Hoichi the Earless for its composition and story. I suggest buying the Criterion released DVD. It is one of the cheaper DVDs of that company.

The initial story explores the fate of a man who leaves his loving wife only to end up regretting his decision. I found this story to be a bit overlong  there's only so long you can drag out something when nothing's happening  but lovely to look at and exceptionally spooky along the same lines as a similar '60s classic ONIBABA.The second story tells the tale of a vengeful snow spirit and is equally spooky with some great handpainted sky backdrops. Again it's overlong and the ending is something of a letdown but the tale works as a whole and contributes to the icy atmosphere of the production. The third story is where things start to lose steam. It starts off promisingly enough with a fine depiction of an epic sea battle but then it goes absolutely nowhere with the plotting. The story is dragged out for a full hour  sometimes whole dialogues are repeated  until the admittedly decent climax.The final story about a haunted cup of tea works far more effectively than it sounds. It's of a far better length read shorter and all the more effective because of that. Sadly despite this film's beauty and visual artistry it does end up being way too long at over three hours and just too slowmoving for my taste so I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd hoped. Certainly not a patch on ONIBABA now that was a great movie!".

These contain the same foreboding presence and stylistic acumen as the latter two directors though Kobayashi is slightly lesser known his works don't pop up in regards to cinema nearly as often as the former two cited directors... and it's a crying shame because Harakiri is one of the greatest Japanese movies ever made.First comes Black Hair a surprising forerunner to the girl with long black hair clich made so popular and familiar with Ringu. It's a classic tale of sinful pride as a husband leaves his wife to gain prestige in the world only to be miserable return and be haunted by her ghost. Then comes The Woman of the Snow possibly the most recognizable of the stories in the West as it involves a malevolent specter giving lenience to a young man as long as he just keeps his mouth shut. Of course he can't... but in the meantime it's the most painterly of the four as the sets are literally painted with a theme of watching eyes in the environment. The story that strikes me as the most Japanese would be Hoichi the Earless a tale of a character attempting to ward off dead samurai but unfortunately forgetting to protect his ears. This one admittedly could have been shorter and dragged at places but still had its moments. And possibly the most cryptic one In a Tea Cup really kind of eludes explanation... a man drinks a soul by accident and as a result ends up trapped in a barrel of water. It sounds bad on paper but of all the stories this last one is the one that really strikes me as something people should really try to see.Painterly is the way Kwaidan is typically described but I can't say I like it as much as Harakiri or Samurai Rebellion. The stagy quality of the imagery felt a little bit more emotionally removed than the expressionistic style of Kobayashi's earlier work. To be sure there is some very striking imagery in this movie and anyone who likes Yume but hasn't seen this needs to go out and rent it immediately. However Kobayashi as a recent discovery of mine was much more surprising and effective earlier and I felt a little let down by some of the imagery and pacing of this movie. It's not bad it's just not as good as his other work.PolarisDiB".

	schema:reviewBody "Kaidan can best be described as a series of breathtakingly gorgeous paintings brought to life immortalized on film. While watching one cannot help but appreciate the stunning visuals  from bright splashes of color stretched across the evening sky to the perfectly elegant yet surprisingly simple makeup that can transform the face of an ordinarily lovely woman into that of an icy inhuman mistress. My particular favorite however was the portrait of Hoichi's entire body covered with handpaintings of ancient texts. Story wise I believed the first tale to be by far the most personally moving literally to tears at one point.But while the film may be a delight to look at and it is but I fear I must say it is by no means an exceptional piece of cinema  at least not as far as plot is concerned. Despite the wealth of attractive imagery I found myself bored and distracted after the first story wrapped itself up and consistently thereafter  which is not to say that the individual tales themselves are unimpressive just poorly executed in my opinion.The bottom line is as follows Kaidan is worth watching for its enchanting imagery alone but I might suggest breaking up your viewing onto 4 separate occasions to avoid intense mindnumbing boredom. Grab some popcorn and an uncomfortable chair. Avoid pillows plush sofas and hot drinks  don't tempt yourself to fall asleep.710".

	schema:reviewBody "I have to place this film in the category of very pretty to look at but lacking substance. Kwaidan is essentially four horror stories stuck together into a very long film. There are four tales one of an abandoned first wife one of a snow woman one of a monk and ghosts and the last and most interesting but not necessarily my favorite about people in water.First of all the imagery in this film is fantastic. Despite the fact that the films are clearly all shot in a studio setting and lack realism the amount of control and precision placed into each shot the costumes the sets all result in a very amazing look.The stories themselves are fairly interesting although simple and very much like oral tradition stories rather than the more complex stories typically told via film. That is to say the the ideas in the story are quite good. However the execution of the stories leaves a lot to be desired. The pace of the film is remarkably slow. It's like molasses.Granted I don't usually mind slow moving films. However there's so much time and energy spent on allowing the images to marinate that I got hypersaturated. At many points I saw all that I wanted to see and wanted to move on. Each story could easily be told in a fivetoten minute oral recitation which would retain all the story points and make it more compelling. But in Kwaidan each story is essentially stretched out to almost half an hour spending large chunks of time with images unnecessary to the storytelling. These stories are very poorly told and I'm not decrying taking time to set up a scene or to relax a viewer into the scenes. Because of the length of the wait the payoffs are a little diminishedwhen they finally happen I was left thinking I waited all this while for that? I mean again the stories are good but imagine sitting for twoandahalf hours listening to a guy tell four short ghost stories. It's just not efficient.However there is a tremendous display of culture and even some history present in the film. I can see the interest and value of the film for that combined with its visual artistry. However I feel that only those with an intense interest in Japan will find all the elements worthwhile. That is to say that Kwaidan is really just for a select audience. Average moviegoers and even many cinephiles will find it lacking. I certainly had a hard time staying awake through its chapters. My favorites story The Woman of the Snow. Most Interesting Cup of Tea. Most cultural display Hoichi the Earless. Scariest story Black Hair.Even with all that I can't recommend it except to those with extremely strong interest in Japan and Japanese culture or those that just love pretty pictures. The rest of you I suggest you find a Japanese storyteller to tell you the stories. You'll get a better effect in about a fifth of the time. Pass. 510.".

At a astonishing 184 minutes the tales are all ones we have heard at some point before but that does not mean that they are told the same not at all. In 'black hair'an uncaring samurai leaves his sweet loving wife to find fortune as he is sick of being poor. Whilst away he marries a rich girl but discovers he is far from happy. He returns to find his first love but when they reunite there is something not quite right about her. In 'woman in the snow' a poor woodcutter is shown mercy by a strange woman he encounters on a snowy night only to lose her years later from a promise he didn't keep. In 'hoichi the earless' a young blind performer with a beautiful voice is drawn to perform every night for a secretive lord who lives in the woods. It is soon apparent that they are ghosts and when Hoichi refuses to play for them they exact revenge. And in the final tale' in a cup of tea' a warrior sees an unknown ghostly face in his cup when he is drinking tea one day.Hailed as the most expensive movie of its time made in japan and on the largest sound stage Kwaiden's stories are unique and none of them use the same set actors or props. Each one is uniquely different and you will agree if you have the chance to watch them! On a backdrop of bright colour and an unnerving musical score Masaki Kobayashi's adaptation of American Lafcadio Hearn's novel will leave you with a definite taste for Japanese cinema if you don't have one already that is!".

I'd be hard pressed to pick a favorite but I was quite fond of both Black Hair and The Woman in the Snow Tales from the Darkside ripped off that one. I also liked Hoichi the Earless the title reveals too much I think though it was a bit dry. In a Cup of Tea was probably the shortest of the four and I really enjoyed the idea behind it. My biggest complaint about Kwaidan is that with the 164minute length and consistently slow pace there are times when the movie drags.

The filmmaker certainly doesn't give much context away but even without understanding much about Stalinist Siberia or knowing exactly what is meant by living in the zone for me the film conveys at once the frustration of living in exile with a child's failure to understand.

One of the more exciting Soviet imports in quite a while is also one of the more depressing films ever made presenting a tough and totally unsentimental depiction of childhood as seen through the eyes of a rebellious schoolboy and the levelheaded young girl with whom he develops an antagonistic friendship. There's a strong documentary flavor to the episodic storyline and grainy black and white photography and writer director Vitaly Kanevsky devotes equal time to the conditions which shape their fate note the subtle but unmistakable condemnation of Stalinism recurring throughout. In effect the film is more of a mood piece with the environment itself ice mud and manure becoming the primary character. It's not always an easy film to watch or understand but the effort can make it a rewarding experience.".

It makes you wonder whether a viewer can choose to alter a film in his own mind and take out the bits  like this for instance  that partly ruin or deplete the experience for you. Aside from that the film which has rightly been assessed as being a kind of Russian 400 Blows is awfully good but since nothing really happens you may find yourself wishing it were shorter but for me it's enough to just enjoy the beautiful black and white cinematography and the performance of this boy. It's a remarkable performance  he's loud but not obnoxious a little whiny but not snotty cute but not sickly sweet. Even though the look and the feel of the film is unique  or a unique amalgam I'll say  even had it not been it could rest quite well on the face of this boy which is open feminine and almost Asian in its features with sharp tiny black eyes.There are some pretty raucous scenes  the most effective being a scene where villagers are clamoring for food handouts and one man eats a pancake of flour and mud but also one at a cultural event a ball of some sort? where the visitors turn to drink. And like that other children's classic My Life as a Dog it has one scene that will stay with you a while  that one had the bottle scene and this one has a scene where our hero gets peed on. Unlike that film not much attention is paid to sex although there is one act of desperate adolescent sexual desire  although it's more like a begging  that's pretty good.The oblique narrative is sometimes hard to understand  at least to me  not tonally it's neither light nor harsh but it has a specific feel but literally and that's probably aided by the fact that the film is mostly a series of events rather than a kind of plot. That's fine because many of the individual scenes are thoroughly interesting and every once in a while we get one like the ice skate thieving which is disorienting and lyrical at the same time. What's particularly interesting about the film I think is that it goes beyond mere mischievousness  like James Dean we are presented with a kid who wants to do the right thing but everything he does gets screwed up. And it's surprising that we end up on his side considering the fact that he at one point tips over a train. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "I have seen Don't Move Die and Rise Again described as one of the grimmest studies of childhood on film.  Superficially yes but the young hero Valerka has a resilience that allows him to cope with most of the situations in which he finds himself.  Children in Dickens or the Brontes often suffer far more.  But having said that the setting of the first threequarters of the film is almost unbelievably drab and depressing.  We are in a mining community situated not far from Vladivostok during the season where snow is melting into slush and mud the time shortly after the end of World War II.  Valerka who lives with his unmarried mother is an extremely streetwise early teenager.  He makes what little money he can by brewing cups of tea for miners coming off their shifts and vies with Galia another girl tea vendor in claims for making it from the freshest water. Their rivalry turns into a camaraderie which is developed and sustained throughout a film that is otherwise rather short on character interest.  For the rest it is the spirit of place that predominates with a stark naturalism that reminds me at times of the Bill Douglas Trilogy with its equally uncompromising depiction of an unlovely semiindustrial wasteland. Only in the last halfhour is there much action.  After being responsible for a minor train derailment Valerka flees his home only to get involved with a gang of thieves.  The ending is tragic but at the same time rather inconclusive.  By having a discursive opening and middle and an action packed conclusion the film suffers from erratic pacing.  I also found it much less involving and consequently less moving that its material would suggest.  Just another piece of Russian misery then?  Not quite.  It contains several uneasy images that one recalls long after it is over several of amputees and an extraordinary closeup of a passer by in a quiet street smiling to reveal rows of grotesque metallic crowns.  Above all Don't Move Die and Rise Again has the virtue of memorability.".

It is one of the most simply brilliant scenes ever staged in a movie.  I don't know if all the credit goes to Demme or the writers but there is a moment in the film where the suspense builds beautifully to a what seems to be a common movie scene.

That was the day I picked to quit smoking and I knew this movie would take my mind off that matter. I was expecting an intense movie and I got it. Little did I realize how wellreceived this film would be and how it propelled Anthony Hopkins to superstardom.Although entertaining this is not always a fun movie to watch especially with the scenes with Ted Levine who plays the killer Buffalo Bill. Bill and his kidnapped young woman are sick and profane people respectively and their scenes are very unpleasant. This movie is not for the squeamish with those and other scenes involving the infamous Dr. Hannibal Lecter Hopkins. There also is some extreme crudeness in the jaildungeon where Lecter and other inmates are held.Jodie Foster is excellent as the FBI agent Clarice Starling and Scott Glenn is lowkey and effective as Jack Crawford. A major part of the film is psychological more than violent as Lecter constantly taunts Clarice while she tries her best to manipulate him to help with a case. The byplay between the two is a game in itself.Hopkins however is the actor people remember best from this movie. His portrayal of the refinedyetcannibalistic serial killerdoctor is one viewers will never forget. I've enjoyed watching him in the sequels too. The looks on his face his fascinating vocabulary with intelligent sarcasm and frankness never ceases to entertain.Silence Of The Lambs has turned into a modernday classic. If by some odd chance you have never seen this movie be warned it is a dark difficult story to watch at times....but it will get your mind off other things.".

The Silence of the Lambs deals with a young FBI cadet Oscarwinner Jodie Foster who is sent to interview a captured madman Oscarwinner Anthony Hopkins in one of the greatest performances ever on the screen to find out about a serial killer Ted Levine who is stripping the skin from his female victims after they die.  The FBI has had no luck with the case and agent Scott Glenn tries to throw a curveball to Hopkins by sending Foster.  Hopkins is a former doctor of Levine and holds the clues to capturing the unknown criminal.  Needless to say the film takes many twists and turns creating a suspenseful thriller that has no equal.  At the heart of The Silence of the Lambs are the confrontations between Hopkins and Foster.  They play a complicated chess match of words which results in some of the greatest footage ever captured for the cinema.  Hopkins dominates in spite of the fact he has approximately 17 minutes of time in the film.  This is a film that will wrap itself around you and you will likely never be able to shake some of the key elements you have seen in this amazing masterpiece.  5 stars out of 5.".

It's only the third film in history to win Academy Awards in all the top five categories Best Picture Best Actor Best Actress Best Director and Adapted Screenplay and that implies something about its technical quality as a film. It features expertee level of craftsmanship in all departments of filmmaking and takes a huge bonus from the exquisite performances put in by its stellar cast.Jodie Foster stars as Clarice Starling a top student at the FBI's training academy. FBI agent Jack Crawford Scott Glenn wants Clarice to interview Dr. Hannibal Lecter Anthony Hopkins a genius psychiatrist who is also a violent psychopath serving life behind bars for various acts of murder and cannibalism. Crawford believes that Lecter may have insight into a case of a serial killer called Buffalo Bill Ted Levine that murders and skins his victims and that Starling as an attractive young woman may be just the bait to make him help with the case.The direction by Jonathan Demme is marvelous as the film introduces its chilling sense of dread and has the audience on the edge of their seats from the moment Howard Shore's score hits the screen till the end of the film especially during the climax with a lot of perfectly crafted suspenseful and nailbiting moments. The editing is perfect as the pace is methodical from start to finish and each and every sequence is relevant to the story. The cinematography by Tak Fujimoto is fantastic as it fully succeeds into creating a very dark and brooding atmosphere that captivates as well as terrorize the audience while also exhibiting excellent camera work that makes heavy use of closeups which increase the creepiness and tension along with displaying an optimal color palette from start to finish. The script by Ted Tally also packs a very well structured plot every character has a welldefined arc all the themes are smartly addressed the attention to detail is quite impressive and the complete story and narrative are perfect.The performances are incredible. Jodie Foster as Clarice is absolutely brilliant and gives an impeccable performance as a woman who is desperately trying to forget her painful past and yet at the same time tries to prove her worth in a male dominant world. Anthony Hopkins as the genius psychiatrist and cannibalistic serial killer Hannibal Lecter is the perfect amalgamation of charisma intelligence and destructive violence and gives a bonechilling and memorable performance that will stand the passage of time as one of the absolute best. The small amount of screen time that Hopkins is given is a definitive testament to his acting capabilities as with such an elegant and minimal performance he solidifies himself as one of the most iconic villains of all time. The charisma and electrifying chemistry between the two actors makes every scene they share an instant classic.In conclusion the Silence of the Lambs is one of the greatest films ever made and a masterwork of brilliant direction smart screenplay splendit camerawork tight editing marvelous score and exquisite performances. The film absolutely deserves all the accolades and recognition it gets for both its contributions to cinema and the immense impact it had on pop culture. Jonathan Demme's magnum opus is not only the quintessential suspence and psychological horror film it is also an ingenious observation of humanity's dark and violent nature and a masterpiece that every film lover must see.".

	schema:reviewBody "Finally I saw this movie for the first time yesterday. I bet everyone has already seen it but just in case Spoilers Below!I've always heard and read that SILENCE OF THE LAMBS was a great movie but I'd never seen it. Now I have and I've learned that it wasn't all hype.Silence of the Lambs is about an FBItrainee named Clarice Starling Jodie Foster who is trying to track down and stop a serial killer named Buffalo Bill Ted Levine who has been killing girls throughout the country. In order to do so she questions Dr. Hannibal Lector Anthony Hopkins. Dr. Lector is a brilliant physiologist who is a convicted serial killer. He appears polite but is actually a very dangerous and intelligent psychopath who eats his victims.I can't express how great I thought this movie was. Just about every scene with Anthony Hopkins was mesmerizing especially his dialogue with Jodie Foster. The last conversation between the two in this movie was chilling to the bone. Dr. Lector's escape was probably the greatest scene in the movie while also one of the most disturbing. When he beats a helpless guard to death with a nightstick it reminds you that he is not the harmless man that he looks like.Anthony Hopkins of course stole the show. He stole every single scene he was in. Jodie Foster did a very good job also as the young ambitious FBI trainee trying to put an end to another madman's reign and in doing so smother the pains of her past. Ted Levine also did a notable job as another very different madman than Lector. I sincerely hated Levine's character by the end of this movie.There are many memorable scenes in this movie. The prison break as I mentioned earlier is one of the more memorable ones. The most intense scene of the movie in my opinion is when Jodie Foster is being stalked in the dark near the end of the film. Anytime that Lector talks you will probably feel shivers up your spine. This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. If like me you have not seen it in all these years do it today. There is a reason this movie is a favorite of many people and crosses many genres.".

It boasts a witty and suspenseful script based on the Thomas Harris novel full of great lines. It has marvelous direction from Demme.  Demme creates suspense very well throughout and uses some great directorial shots such as the twin frames of Clarice ringing a doorbell and the FBI men breaking into a home.  The two lead actors won oscars for their performances...each deserved.  Foster is very good in her role but it is Anthony Hopkins that literally lights up the screen with his complex portrayal of a complex serial killer.  Hopkins does the seemingly impossible. He frightens you with his outrageousness and yet illicts some pitycompassionalbeit not a lot for his situation.  He says his lines with reservedness when needed and brashness when needed.  The rest of the cast is also quite good with Anthony Heald a standout as a unethical petty doctor in charge of Hopkins.  Of course the story of the other killer is very very chilling as well.  A quality film in all aspects!".

	schema:reviewBody "There is little doubt that the most memorable aspect of The Silence of the Lambs is Anthony Hopkins' incomparable performance as Lecter. Taking over for Brian Cox who was effective but not especially memorable as the good doctor in 1986's Manhunter Hopkins instantly makes the role his own capturing and conveying the charismatic essence of pure evil. To his dying day no matter how many roles he plays in the interim Hopkins will forever be known for this part. It is a credit to Hopkins' ability as an actor that this part did not result in stereotyping. His postSilence career has been greatly varied with roles as widely diverse as a stodgy butler in MerchantIvory's The Remains of the Day and an action hero in The Edge. I can throw out any number of superlatives but none of them do justice to this chilling performance which I labeled as the best acting work of the '90s. Want to feel the icy fingers of terror stroke your heart? Watch this mixture of brilliant eloquence and inhuman cruelty. As portrayed by Hopkins Hannibal is both a suave cultured gentleman and an unspeakable fiend. He is gracious and monstrous at the same time. Hopkins also provided one of the most quotable lines in recent film history with I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti which was followed by an inimitable slithering slurp.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Silence of the Lambs 1991 is a classic psychological suspense brilliant masterpiece well acted and the best thriller ever made! This was my first film I saw on VHS as a teenager and I absolutely loved it. Right after seeing this flick I heard about Hannibal 2001 Ridley Scot film a sequel to this psychological thriller flick I rushed buying it right away. Saddly I was disappointed with Ridley Scott Hannibal.Silence of the Lambs  is a classic and I think people would agree. It is my number 1 favorite thriller ever made mostly I have enjoyed Jodie Foster as FBI recruit Clarice Starling's. Jodie did a brilliant acting performance I have seen. I love this film to death I absolutely love everything about this film. Since the first time I saw her in Silence I went to seeing her in a movie theater 2002 Panic Room it was her first film I saw in movie theater since than I love Jodie Foster but Silence will be her best film she ever made. I was disappointed with the sequel Hannibal no Jodie Foster in it no brilliant masterful Clarice. Julianne Moore was incompetent for me she couldn't catch Hannibal. Clarice Starling character was based on Gillian Anderson's FBI Agent Dana Scully and I think The XFiles inspired this film. I am even convinced that The Lone Gunman three geeks were also based on this film. You have a nice shootout on the end with Clarice and Buffalo Bill and Clarice get's her man spoils her plans saves the hostage and saves the day.The Silence of the Lambs is the 1991 thriller that was the feature film adaptation of the novel of the same name by Thomas Harris and marked the first appearance of Anthony Hopkins as Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Oscarwinner Anthony Hopkins in one of the greatest performances ever on the screen Dr.Hannibal The Cannibal Lecter is a brutal killer with revolting methods and habits but he's also very intelligent charismatic and with good taste you can interpret that as you like. He is scary and his the same time awesome including brilliant you can't out smart him. Director Jonathan Demme is masterful directing this flick you have to be brilliant you have to keep thinking to solve the murder mystery. Scott Glenn acts beautiful as Jack Crawford. This flick got five major Academy Awards Oscars for Best Movie Director Actor Actress Screenplay it is no wonder why.Plot FBI recruit Clarice Starling Jodie Foster is asked by the Bureau to elicit Lecter's help in tracking down a notorious serial killer who has kidnapped a US Senator's daughter. Directed by Jonathan Demme The Manchurian Candidate the film would receive five Academy Awards including Best Picture Best Actor for Hopkins and Best Actress for Foster and Best Screenplay. Hopkins would reprise his role as Lecter in two more films Hannibal 2001 and Red Dragon 2002.Real life killer Ed Gein was the inspiration for Buffalo Bill as well as the inspiration for Norman Bates from Psycho and Leatherface from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre movies. And the director Jonathan Demme was a film student of Roger Corman who makes a cameo in the movie. Roger Corman taught not only him but I think other filmmakers such as Martin Scorsese James Cameron Joe Dante Francis Ford Coppola and many others. Ted Levine did a pretty solid job as a serial killer Buffalo Bill. This film is fun intense very well fast paced goes quickly around for those two hours.The Silence of the Lambs is a 1991 American horrorthriller film directed by Jonathan Demme and starring Jodie Foster Anthony Hopkins and Scott Glenn. The film is based on Thomas Harris' 1988 novel of the same name his second to feature Hannibal Lecter a brilliant psychiatrist and cannibalistic serial killer. In the film Clarice Starling a young U.S. FBI trainee seeks the advice of the imprisoned Dr. Lecter to apprehend another serial killer known only as Buffalo Bill.This movie is a perfect 10 out of 10 it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth Jonathan Demme with a brilliant cast including Thomas Harris novel that was adapted from it. I even saw the Documentary how they were shooting this film on YouTube. I think I do have that documentary film in my Bluray special features. Watch this film you want be disappointed at all. The movie is incredibly suspenseful and an absolute must see for fans.".

Bill has already killed five girls skinning off sections of their bodies. Lecter is intrigue by Starling and helps her with the investigation they start to form a strange friendship.The Silence of the Lambs is one of the best psychological thrillers. Thomas Harris's best selling book is faithfully transfered to the screen. It's one dark twisted disturbing ride. The mood is heighten by Demme's great direction with such detail in all the sets and locations. Demme has used reflective surfaces wonderfully during one of Starling's and Lecter's talks it used to great extent. One of the final sequences of Clarice walking through the basement of Bill's house is one of the most suspense full scenes i have ever seen.All the performances are knock outs. Jodie Foster as always brings the goods and makes Starling the most interesting to watch. At times she makes Starling so fragile then a second later she's strong as steel. Anthony Hopkins is so disturbing as Lecter. From the first second you see Lecter standing in his cell just waiting for Starling to show you can see Hopkins was perfect casting. You cant keep your eyes off Lecter he's so disturbing and can make your skin crawl every time he speaks. Ted Levine makes the perfect serial killer you can see from Levine's performance what a torn and damaged soul the killer is you feel somewhat sympathetic for him.The Silence of the Lambs is a must see one of the best thrillers you'll ever see.".

Demme has used reflective surfaces wonderfully during one of Starling's and Lecter's talks it used to great extent. One of the final sequences of Clarice walking through the basement of Bill's house is one of the most suspense full scenes i have ever seen.All the performances are knock outs. Jodie Foster as always brings the goods and makes Starling the most interesting to watch. At times she makes Starling so fragile then a second later she's strong as steel. Anthony Hopkins is so disturbing as Lecter. From the first second you see Lecter standing in his cell just waiting for Starling to show you can see Hopkins was perfect casting. You cant keep your eyes off Lecter he's so disturbing and can make your skin crawl every time he speaks. Ted Levine makes the perfect serial killer you can see from Levine's performance what a torn and damaged soul the killer is you feel somewhat sympathetic for him.The Silence of the Lambs is a must see one of the best thrillers you'll ever see.";

The incredibly disciplined way in which the film restrains its two most flamboyant aspects  those being the serial killers Hannibal Lecter and Buffalo Bill  to always maintain the perspective of its rookie FBI protagonist as she navigates her way through her newfound world of silvertongued devils and elusive monsters is both impressive and necessary in elevating the piece above what could've been simple shock value. The feature is gripping right from its opening moments and always maintains a tight grip on its psychologically complex characters who remain fully rounded no matter on which side of sociopathy  or the law  they sit. Thanks to a mature treatment of its audience it never feels as though it is pandering or dumbing itself down rather elevating the viewer to its own level of intelligence. The picture also knows when to pull back on the reigns too making for an experience far more cerebral than visceral this is something perhaps unexpected from a thriller where a serialkilling cannibal is for all intents and purposes one of the 'good guys.' 810".

	schema:reviewBody "This is deservedly one of the most popular and praised of all the entries in the wornout cop vs. killer genre and represents a career high point for its key participants. It's especially noteworthy that it should have swept the five major Oscars for the year of its release considering that the Academy wouldn't normally award such acclaim to a thriller with often grim and disturbing content  a tribute to how well crafted it is. Also worthy of a mention is the way that this film put the Behavioural Sciences unit of the FBI on the map  that unit devoted to the study of the most deviant human beings among us. Director Jonathan Demme shows a great skill for the genre and with the assistance of a first rate crew creates some eerily effective suspense. Based on the novel by Thomas Harris it stars Jodie Foster as an eager beaver young FBI trainee who is sent by her superior Scott Glenn to interview an imprisoned murderer the intelligent cultured psychopath Hannibal The Cannibal Lecter Anthony Hopkins in the hopes that he can lend his insight into the activities of Buffalo Bill Ted Levine a serial killer currently on the loose. Other than a music score by Howard Shore that is a little too over the top and manipulative The Silence of the Lambs hits all the right notes telling a story in a taut and convincing manner. The subject matter admittedly is not to every taste  especially when one thinks about what Bills' ultimate plan is. The editing by Craig McKay production design by Kristi Zea and cinematography by Tak Fujimoto are exemplary among the scariest scenes are Clarices' Foster search of a storage space and the climactic action where agent and maniac are finally face to face and the sequence leading up to that. Of course the real meat of the story is the unusual relationship between the charismatic Lecter and the determined Clarice as he demands she divulge personal information in return for his thoughts on the Buffalo Bill case. Lecter is a truly memorable character from his choice of entertainment to the way that he gleefully toys with those people that he holds in contempt. Hopkins and Foster are both very effective in these parts although the contributions of the supporting cast absolutely should not go overlooked. Given the way that Lecter dominates the proceedings it's important to point out just how extremely creepy Bill is his performance brought character actor Levine to real prominence. Brooke Smith is very good portraying a wouldbe victim who actually tries to use her wits and fight back in some way. Also appearing are many other familiar faces Anthony Heald as the smarmy jerk in charge of the insane asylum Diane Baker Kasi Lemmons Demme regulars Charles Napier and Tracey Walter his old mentor Roger Corman as the director of the FBI Frankie Faison Dan Butler Chris Isaak and Daniel von Bargen. Even at just under two hours long this is actually pretty taut in terms of pacing there's no filler at all just some very potent entertainment. This was preceded by another Harris adaptation Manhunter in which Brian Cox played Lecter and would be followed by Hannibal and after that Red Dragon another film version of the source novel for Manhunter. Some people tend to prefer Manhunter and consider it superior this viewer merely prefers to think that they each have their own heavy assets. Nine out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's impossible to comment on SILENCE OF THE LAMBS as being a mere film . Its release was a watershed in popular culture and has influenced a myriad of imitations that are far too numerous to mention . Much of this success is down to director Jonathan Demme who has made the film so effective by coming up with the strikingly simple idea of filming everything in dim lighting which gives SILENCE a moody and brooding atmosphere that was absent from movies in the previous decade . Ironically enough this is as typical of 90s film making as MANHUNTER was of 80s movies . Howard Shore's score also helps the proceedings and Jodie Foster gives a sublime nuanced performance as vulnerable heroine Clarice Starling . Watch the scenes closely when Clarice is in the company of men  don't you get the feeling she has a phobia about the male of the species . Is she a victim of sexual abuse in her childhood ? A lesbian ? We never find out but Foster's performance is multi layered and it's a pity this aspect is never explored in HANNIBAL which sadly deletes this aspect to Clarice Sadly SILENCE was released with a tidal wave of hype which the film doesn't live up to . Who can forget the stories that upon seeing this at the cinema certain audience members wanted armed escorts back to their cars ! I'm sorry but despite being a good thriller it's not that good and I fail to see how people were turned into quivering jellies unable to sleep with the lights off . I'm also afraid to say that much of the awards heaped upon the film aren't that well deserved either . Foster deserved the Oscar as did the film and possibly Demme too but did Ted Tally for his adapted screenplay ? All he seems to have done is to copy the best bits of Harris's novel wholesale into the screenplay without making an effort to improve anything . and i'll probably be accused of sacrilege but the more times I see this film the more times I ask myself how did Hopkins win the Oscar for Best Actor ? I don't even think Hopkins should have qualified for the Best Actor category since the role isn't on screen long enough and his performance is slightly hammy . Hannibal as played by Hopkins resembles something along the lines of a paedophile rather than a serial killer who has maimed  murdered and munched on adults . Despite having some reservations of Brian Cox as Hannibal in MANHUNTER you do believe his burly presence does have the physical strength to overpower his victims  not so Hopkins I know it's very difficult  perhaps even impossible  but the best way to enjoy this movie is to erase from your mind the fact that it's one of only three movies to have picked up the Oscar in all five main categories  the fact that it made headlines about being the most terrifying film committed to celluloid  and the fact that it stands as the 28th best movie ever on this website . It is a very good thriller but one that is ultimately disappointing after hearing of the hype surrounding it".

However from a lot of the comments I have read about this film I do not think many got the gist of the message from the author and the film maker. This film is a great modern fable a fable in the dictionary is defined as a brief fictitious story that teaches a moral. There are many morals defined in this film but foremost is integrity and a simple goodness.I have a half brother who grew up in the Southern U.S. and on one occasion we were discussing this film and he said he felt it portrayed Southerners as dimwitted. I disagreed with him and informed him that the author himself was a native Southerner. The setting is central to this story in that it lets the tale unfold tying in factual events with the fable before us.The film is wonderfully directed by Robert Zemeckis the film is his opus and is acted by a great cast on all levels. From the children who were Forrest Gump and Gump Jr. by Haley Joel Osment. Say what you want but I feel Tom Hanks deserved the Oscar award. Gary Sinise is synonymous with Lt.Dan whenever you hear those words. Sally Fields is the loving dutiful mother in her challenging situation. Mykelti Williamson as Bubba gives you a real sense in the story that Gump had a genuine friend he moves you with his character. Words don't grasp the full performance of Robin Wright Penn as Jenny. Jennys' tenderness and pain are palpable as exhibited by Wright.I feel that much of Gumps' appeal is his downright sense of doing the right thing regardless of the people and situations around him and we see that in this film. That being the case maybe we all wish we could be just a little more like that trying to maintain innate goodness and not the tradeoffs we often make as we go down lifes highways.The movie has it all toodramacomedy and it challenges societal norms as well. Then there are the almost endless quotes from the movie that have slipped into everyday speech. They are too numerous to say at this point.One of the toppers for me in the movie is when Forrest is in a quandary about life and wondering as Lt.Dan said we all have a destiny and his Mom says it is where we are all just floating around like a feather in the wind. Forrest's character terms it very well with this quoteI think it is a little bit of both. From my experiences in life it does appear to be that way. So if you have not seen the moviesee it soon you are in for a real treat. If you did not like it give it a try again and hopefully you will see it for the great story it is!".

So he ends up just stumbling into all the major historical events of the time. Granted he achieves this only because he doesn't have the brains to think otherwise and actually have expectations but so many of our problems are because we do have higher intellect and desires which ironically makes us unhappy because we know what we are missing.

	schema:reviewBody "I've made about 20 films and 5 of them are pretty goodTom Hanks.Forrest Gump is one of the best movies of all time guaranteed. I really just love this movie and it has such a special place in my heart. The performances are just so unforgettable and never get out of your head. The characters I mean the actors turned into them and that's what got to me. The lines are so memorable touching and sometimes hilarious.We have Forrest GumpTom Hanks not the sharpest tool in the box his I.Q. is right below the average scores. But his mamaSally Field believes that her boy has the same opportunities as anyone else and lets Forrest know that there's nothing that could hold him back. As a boy he is put into braces for his legs since he has a crooked back and really doesn't have too many friends. When he gets on a school bus for his first day of school NO ONE will let him sit next to them. This scene is so heart breaking until you hear a little angel's voice You can sit here if you want. Jenny Forrest's best friend and crush she looks so incredibly innocent and you love her because her and Forrest are like pea's and carrots. But we find out that there is an extremely unfortunate side to her life she has a father that's always kissing and touching her and her sisters. Forrest just assumes that it's a father's love since he doesn't have a dad that could show him that it's wrong.Forrest and Jenny together walk every day from school and when these kids start throwing rocks at Forrest calling him stupid Jenny just tells Forrest Run Forrest! Run!. He miraculously breaks the braces off his legs and run like the wind blows. Forrest meets many celebrities from his life that just happened to be there Elvis Presley visited his house before hitting it big President Kennedy honored him with a all American football award President Johnson who honored him with a medal of honor for his actions in Vietnam President Nixonin which Forrest happens to discover a problem in the Water Gate Hotel because some people seem to be flashing lights around and John Lennon through a talk show to talk about his medal of honor.Forrest meets some interesting people along the way too that are even better than these celebrities combined Bubba his Vietnam war friend who dreams of owning a shrimp boat one day and was born with big gums. He is just so wonderful and charming and won't stop talking about shrimp. Luteniet Dan a leader of Forrest's army in Vietnam who gets saved by Forrest during a huge attack and looses his legs as a result. Luteniet Dan was by far my favorite character he has so much pride and wants to die in Vietnam due to his family history tradition of dying in every single American war. He and Forrest make quite a pair. And of course there's Jenny a very tragic figure she gets more mean as she grows up because she knows that Forrest loves her in some ways you can't blame her really. She was obviously abused and I think she felt that Forrest was too good for her or that he couldn't really give her the love she wanted. Robin Wright what a beautiful and wonderful actress.This movie is incredible and should be seen by everyone. I am not kidding Forrest Gump is a remarkable movie and inspires everyone. It's not just about someone stupid who happens to be in great places and historic events just because of being in the right place at the right time. This story is beautiful and will inspire everyone to go the distance and see the world like Forrest did and will never give up on their dreams.1010".

When he gets on a school bus for his first day of school NO ONE will let him sit next to them. This scene is so heart breaking until you hear a little angel's voice You can sit here if you want. Jenny Forrest's best friend and crush she looks so incredibly innocent and you love her because her and Forrest are like pea's and carrots. But we find out that there is an extremely unfortunate side to her life she has a father that's always kissing and touching her and her sisters. Forrest just assumes that it's a father's love since he doesn't have a dad that could show him that it's wrong.Forrest and Jenny together walk every day from school and when these kids start throwing rocks at Forrest calling him stupid Jenny just tells Forrest Run Forrest! Run!. He miraculously breaks the braces off his legs and run like the wind blows. Forrest meets many celebrities from his life that just happened to be there Elvis Presley visited his house before hitting it big President Kennedy honored him with a all American football award President Johnson who honored him with a medal of honor for his actions in Vietnam President Nixonin which Forrest happens to discover a problem in the Water Gate Hotel because some people seem to be flashing lights around and John Lennon through a talk show to talk about his medal of honor.Forrest meets some interesting people along the way too that are even better than these celebrities combined Bubba his Vietnam war friend who dreams of owning a shrimp boat one day and was born with big gums. He is just so wonderful and charming and won't stop talking about shrimp. Luteniet Dan a leader of Forrest's army in Vietnam who gets saved by Forrest during a huge attack and looses his legs as a result. Luteniet Dan was by far my favorite character he has so much pride and wants to die in Vietnam due to his family history tradition of dying in every single American war. He and Forrest make quite a pair. And of course there's Jenny a very tragic figure she gets more mean as she grows up because she knows that Forrest loves her in some ways you can't blame her really. She was obviously abused and I think she felt that Forrest was too good for her or that he couldn't really give her the love she wanted. Robin Wright what a beautiful and wonderful actress.This movie is incredible and should be seen by everyone. I am not kidding Forrest Gump is a remarkable movie and inspires everyone. It's not just about someone stupid who happens to be in great places and historic events just because of being in the right place at the right time. This story is beautiful and will inspire everyone to go the distance and see the world like Forrest did and will never give up on their dreams.1010";

I would only mention that the skillful and seamless blending of music action and period costume was enthralling. And yet it was so perfectly understated that Forrest Gump's travels through thirty five years of the stormiest and most meaningful years of American history only became clearly defined for the viewer.

	schema:reviewBody "What I find completely ridiculous is why this movie in my opinion one of the best ever has such a low rating so I've tried to figure out what some found against it.I noticed that the haters of this movie who make it have a lower rating than it actually deserves mainly argue that it promotes the government's politics of submission the idea that if you're an idiot but you do what you're told then you will be rewarded but if you experience life then you're going to die a miserable death. I'm not an American myself so i don't have any intention to defend the government or anyone else but I think that the political events witnessed by the character in the movie make many miss the whole substance of the film. I think these bits of history only add to the magic of the film making Forrest part of a fantastic world that seems so incredibly real though. How can somebody say that Forrest is just an idiot an ordinary person who does everything that he is told to do? It appears to me that in factin his innocence Forrest does what he feels he has to dono matter the situations and the people around him lead only by an inner sense of right. So what actually seems to be special about Forrest is that regardless of his intelligence he has the capacity to discover simple truth and life values that all the others around him miss he tries to save Bubba endangering his own life he gives Bubba's family money and mainly displays simple goodness in everything he does. So if you haven't yet seen the movie or you were disappointed by it try watching it without analyzing things that much and just open your heart towards that world. The brilliant humour the hilarious yet touching acting the special effects and the uplifting message are totally rewarding.".

	schema:headline " Tom Hanks delivers an astounding performance as Forrest Gump.";
	schema:reviewBody "Starring Tom Hanks Robin Wright Gary Sinise Sally Field This was flat out one of the best movies of 1994. It won best picture for a reason along with a few other Academy Awards. I think one of the tag lines for the movie was The world will never be the same once you've seen it through the eyes of Forrest Gump. How true. The movie is basically one simple man's journey through life. And what a journey.The movie opens with Forrest Hanks sitting at a bus stop waiting to go see Jenny Wright after being apart from her for years. Who is Jenny you ask? We'll get to that in a minute. Forrest strikes up a conversation or two with the people that come and wait for the bus with him. Or more accurately he keeps talking regardless of whether anybody is listening or not. The movie plays out as a flashback with Forrest taking us through all the major events of his life and narrating them.The flashback starts when Forrest is a little boy about six years old or so just at about the age where he should be starting school. We get to take a look at Forrest's childhood as he gets leg braces to straighten out his back as his momma Field fights and does a few other things to get him into public school and as he meets for the first time the love of his life. Jenny. He meets her on the way to school sitting next to her on the bus and they strike up a friendship immediately.Eventually we progress to the point where Forrest and Jenny are in high school and we travel along with Forrest as he makes it onto the football team and gets to go to college. Forrest and Jenny never date but he's always there to protect her. Anytime he thinks she's in trouble he rushes to the rescue ready to beat the everloving snot out of anyone who even looks at his Jenny wrong. I think one of my favorite scenes in the movie is when someone is dumb enough to slap Jenny. The film goes slow motion Forrest's eyes go wide and he starts charging at this guy like a runaway locomotive and has the striking force of one too. Watching him beat the crap out of that guy is hilarious.As Forrest grows up and goes through school college the army a Vietnam tour becomes a ping pong celebrity a shrimp boat captain and eventually one of the richest men out there he also gets to take a few stops in history as the filmmaker gives us his own spin of how he thinks history would have happened if Forrest Gump were there. He gets to meet the President three times he's the man who exposes the Watergate scandal he's at the school doors when Governor George Wallace tries to get some Negroes into a white school and so on and so forth. It's really funny the way they manipulate historical footage to insert Forrest into the events of the past.This is truly a great movie. You'd be a fool to miss it.Bottom Line 4 out of 4 own this movie".

	schema:reviewBody "Forrest Gump 1994  out of 4 Forrest Gump Tom Hanks a slow but simple man from Alabama takes us through decades of his life which includes various historical settings but all the while his heart is on Jenny Robin Wright Penn a childhood friend.FORREST GUMP was released and quickly became a huge hit and ended up winning many Oscars. Today for whatever reason the film seems to be hated by many people because of the movies it beat out. I've never really understood putting too much importance on Oscars or any other award show and I really don't understand why one movie must take a beating just because of what films it beat out. ORDINARY PEOPLE takes a beating because it beat RAGING BULL. Something like DANCES WITH WOLVES takes a beating because it beat GOODFELLAS. Then there's FORREST GUMP that takes a beating because it beat out PULP FICTION or THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION.As far as the film itself goes I think this is a great one. I've always liked how the film took a look at a simple person's life and a simple person who is always in very big situations yet never really understands it. There are countless bits of dialogue that are remembered by mans and they've entered the public IQ but the one dealing with knowing what love is is the one that always caught my attention as far as what this film is about. To me Gump goes through all these historic things yet it's always his love for Jenny that is the heart of the picture.I thought the story itself was quite great and especially how we take a look at American history through the 60s 70s and 80s. I know some people make this a political movie but I've always found that to be rather foolish. The film has a wonderful soundtrack to highlight the various eras that are shown and we also get some clever use of CGI to put Gump in the presence of people like JFK and Richard Nixon. The screenplay hits all the right notes and there's no question that technically speaking the film is impressive.Then there are the performances that really make the movie. Hanks picked up his second Best Actor award and while I personally would have given it to Paul Newman for his performance in NOBODY'S FOOL there's no question that Hanks is great here. He certainly nailed that simple man and there's not a false moment in the performance. Gary Sinise is wonderful in his role as is Mykelti Williamson in his small bit. Robin Wright Penn is the perfect opposite to Hank's character and Sally Field is good as well.No matter what people say FORREST GUMP is still a wonderful little gem that has a lot of great things in it.".

Teaches you about the power of love and innocence. Sometimes we take our life as granted and all we think is we don't have anything. This movie tells you how to realize and work with all that you have no matter how you are. Brilliant way of telling a story of a young boy Forrest and his life. Not only through the eye of Forrest but a mother a friend and general people. The way your innocence wins over anyone you come across is exceptional and all you will leave behind is love and respect.

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie in the theaters back in 1994. When it was released on VHS I obtained that version. I've watched the movie about once every two years since then. This is an amazing movie in any number of ways. One big way it amazes me is the way which it as a simple and guileless little story like a feather wafting in the breeze nevertheless evokes raw rank hatred and eyeballbulging forehead veinpopping spittlespewing vitriol from liberals and socalled intellectuals who are absolutely certain that like a guided missile it is seeking them out intentionally personally to insult them with rightwing thoughts and ideas and by a nitwit character no less. Hahahaha. As if.So let's first thing pop that little pea right out of the shooter. Let's dispense with the bilge of this movie being some kind of sub rosa rightwing plot. Puhleeeze. This is a mainstream Hollywood production. Robert Zemeckis Tom Hanks Sally Field and Robin Wright Penn are all known Hollywood lefties liberal devotees who would take the pipe long before allowing themselves to be associated with or be used by anything akin a rightwing movie let alone be openly and voluntarily involved in making one. Bottom line this is not a political movie. This is not a movie which is making any kind of political or social statements in any respect. People who think it is doing any of that are just working way too hard overthinking it all. Period. It's odd because it's really not all that complicated of a thing to understand. Which leads directly to another amazing thing about this movie it is amazing the way the simple little message the movie is actually sending just sails right over so many people's heads. Amazingly they just don't get it and based on the comments here they still aren't getting it 14 years later and counting. So if you fall into that category let me help you out.What is the message of Forrest Gump? Stripped to its purest essence this movie is about loyalty and devotion particularly to the ones in our lives we love and care about. These are the human values being reinforced. Loyalty. Devotion. Forrest Gump embodies loyalty and devotion. To his mama. To his good best buddy Bubba. To the love of his life Jenny. To his leader Lt. Dan. And in the end to Forrest Jr. One by one and all together Forrest sticks by and takes care of his family friends and loved ones. This is the thread running through the entire story. This is what carries Forrest to all of the remarkable places he goes along the way.The use of a mentally challenged man as the leading man is a conceit used to illustrate the point that loyalty and devotion are the most important things in life trumping everything else. It drives home the point that nothing else really matters anywhere near as much. Indeed it drives it home with blunt force. Maybe it drives it home too hard for such a simple little point. Maybe this is where the movie's detractors get themselves sidetracked. There are a number of other amazing and remarkable things about this movie. The performances. The special effects. The almost poetic simplicity of the story and the way it is told. See it for all this and more but please don't overthink it.".

This is an exceptionally touching film with a great cast excellent choice of music and a thoroughly pleasing narrative. Some of the dialogue in this film is now commonly quoted in everyday life which is a great achievement. It was a teeny bit long though otherwise this film would have probably got a perfect scored.Despite Forest Gump's low IQ Gump leads a truly charmed life with a ringside seat for numerous of the most notable events in the late 20th century. without trying hard just other might do Forrest teaches Elvis Presley how to dance becomes a football star meets John F.

Featured alongside Tom Hanks are Sally Field as Forrest's mother Gary Sinise as his commanding officer in Vietnam Mykelti Williamson as his illfated Army buddy who is familiar with every recipe that involves shrimp and the special effects artists whose digital magic place Forrest during a remarkable array of historical events and people.In fact nothing is quite pursued to its logical conclusion which makes the film more a triumph of style than content. Nevertheless this is certainly what it is. Gump is not so much a measure of its times as a benign reflection upon them nearly but not quite through the eyes of its lovable protagonist. The film goes through all the emotions but does not appeal on any of them long enough to trouble anyone.".

This is the prefect family film or perhaps a film for a couple that wants to curl up with some popcorn. Tom Hanks is truly amazing in this role and shows how a versatile actor he really is. My favourite thing about this film is how complex and well thought out the plot is i often feel that writers and directors falter in their simplistic story lines.

When she arrives in Boston she learns that Larkin has been eliminating his competition and taking over their operations. She learns that Rojas is in Boston PD custody and goes to see him to ask him what he knows about Larkin but is warned that the cop who arrested Rojas Shannon Mullins is very territorial and she is not exactly sociable.

I think I chuckled once or twice or maybe I threw up a little in my mouth  I'm not sure. I LOVED Bridesmaids so I was expecting a funny movie. This movie was depressing and I would have walked out but my girlfriend was enjoying herself so we stayed.Decent cast and some good comedians which had nothing to work with. I was saying the lines before the characters were they were so obvious. The plot is terrible with no surprises and the script seemed to be an ad lib for Mellissa McCarthy. Don't get me wrong she is funny but it got to the point the movie seemed like a 2 hour Saturday Night Live skit. The executions and deaths were puzzling in a comedy. Our heroines waving guns in the faces of innocent civilians for laughs wasn't funny. The message that Sandra Bullock couldn't get a man because she was threatening to men was ridiculous. The Heat is more like a summer blizzard. I can't recommend it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I remember when I saw reviews when The Heat first came out everybody and I mean everybody was bashing this movie. Saying it was worthless stupid vulgar pointless etc. It even got to the stage where people were getting so offensive and making death threats to the film makers. Seriously all of you i'm here to tell you BACK THE HELL OFF! And for those people out there who are really smart do not believe what you have been told. This movie is truly great in so many different ways.It is indeed the stereotypical buddycop type movie. But if you can exclude that clich it is actually extremely well thought out and well put together.We start off with a professional smart agent named Detective Ashburn Sandra Bullock. She has everything you could have. She's smart intelligent polite so committed to her job that it makes other officers look bad. Yet somehow has relationship troubles does not have any friends and just works works works until she can sleep.Now we have Officer Mullins Melissa McCarthy . She is the complete opposite of Ashburn. Mullins is vulgar crude rough tough mean and says the f word almost in every sentence and is not afraid to shoot your dick off or throw watermelons at you! Both of them are fighting over a serious case over a serial killer named Larkin. Larkin means business this man kills families and is not afraid to kill anyone who gets in his way of either drugs or murder.The humor is a combination of everything. There is a lot of witty humor and at the same time loads of vulgar humor. I loved the chemistry between Mullins and Ashburn as well. I like how we watch them slowly have a connection with each other and start talking about each others lives and how they start forming a friendship they have never had before.In my opinion hilarious lots of action lots chemistry and loads of fun. Don't know where everyone else went wrong! 1010".

Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy are well cast as the misfit FBI and Boston cop team tasked with finding a local drug lord. Yes its a female cop buddy movie and yes it works thanks to Bullock's and McCarthy's funny lines and well timed physical comedy.The Heat is refreshing to watch. Unique in today's all too male focused cinema The Heat's two main characters are women and NOT typical stereotyped females  no big breasts skin tight unrealistic clothing and high heals no bleach blonde airheadedness and no they don't get frightened and wait for some guy to to come along and save the day. Neither of these women pine away for men to come sweep them off their feet and get married. Neither possess any stereotyped domestic skills McCarthy's character calls curtains window blankets and keeps her refrigerator stocked with high powered weapons. Both are very career focused and the best at what they do and both are very very funny.Yes this movie contains lots of profanity as many reviewers have noted but what recent male buddy comedy hasn't? Hot Tub Time Machine The Hangover I II and III Grown Ups This is the End etc. ....all very funny buddy movies starring men and all contained lots of profanity that isn't really noted in reviews. So why is The Heat's profanity even noted? Because its women mouthing the words? I think it was even funnier with Bullock and McCarthy especially McCarthy tattletits then if done by male characters  unexpected and well timed.I was pleasantly surprised that in this movie era where only men are allowed to have fun and women only get bit parts that this movie got the green light. Hopefully this is the beginning of a new era in Hollywood where female stereotypes get replaced by movies that give women more lead roles and opportunities to act in comedies dramas you name it outside of stupid outdated stereotypes.If you're in need of a good laugh watch The Heat seriously fun comedy for adults!".

I suppose I might be being a tad harsh since there was one or two reasonably funny moments from a couple of minor characters  but the overwhelming sense was that the only chance this film had of being watchable was if the two main characters had been wiped out within the first 5 minutes and the end credits started rolling there and then.

Yes Sandra and Melissa reliably play in position. Bullock is Sarah Ashburn the rigid know it all FBI agent booking for an Agency promotion. But as current boss Hale patient and dashing Demian Bichir explains her downside Nobody likes you. Melissa McCarthy is abrasive no nonsense Boston Cop Mullins who can beat the crap out of any man. She torments her Captain Woods prematurely aged funny Tom Wilson looking for his lady balls in his office.While wallowing in their sorrows at Mullin's favorite bar Ashburn Bullock confesses to Mullins McCarthy that not a lot of people know that she was married. With Scotch in hand Mullins asks Was he a hearing man? Director Paul Feig Bridesmaids is genius with niche Rrated comedy starring women and is blessed with Bullock and McCarthy's AGames. Writer Katie Dippold of Parks and Recreation is brilliant given a very predictable movie scenario. Will Ashburn and Mullins become BFFs? Of course. Dippold's comic Zen lies in the journey. The Heat is more than just Lethal Weapon meets The Hangover. There is a signature moment in diner where Bullock attempts to save a choking man. Feig is comically ruthless. Bullock and McCarthy never waver out of character as their partnership naturally evolvesthey are amazing.I don't know if Feig and Dippold transform the cop buddy genera regardless it is hilarious. The coarse language works. Seeing Bullock's Ashburn struggle to say the fword is anal retentive priceless. Smartly The Heat is more comedy and relationship focused than action. Although the knife scene with Ashburn and Mullins held hostage is absolutely hysterical. The rangy odd couple joins forces in Boston to uncover the identity of mysterious Drug Lord Lassen. For the first hour of the movie Bullock may be trying too hard to be unlikable as Ashburn. She did it better in The Proposal. On the other hand McCarthy is like a comfortable catcher's mitt as Mullins. It turns out that Mullins is estranged from her family because she put her brother Jason hilarious Michael Rapaport in jail. Jane Curtain is classic funny as disapproving Mom. Jason may have ties to the mysterious Lassen.Sandra Bullock looks stunning lean and strong. Granted she does her frumpy best as Ashburn straight man to McCarthy's Mullins. Pants suits can do only so much. The one thing that is odd about the story is that Bullock comes off so stiff that we forget that she is extremely competent at what she does. Like McCarthy's Mullins she is smart but the story finally circles back and reminds that both can kick some ass as well. McCarthy is brilliant balancing authentic compassion in the midst of what could have been a broad strokes caricature. She is hysterical and whimsically grounded. Together Bullock and McCarthy are on fire chemistry. Too bad Marlon Wayans is not leveraged more as Levy Ashburn's awkward and endearing love interest. He is very cool. Perhaps next time. Let's see Bullock and McCarthy together again. Bring on The Heat 2. In the meantime see The Heat. You'll laugh a whole lot.".

Melissa McCarthi is in the top form and well supported by Sandra Bullock. Though story lacks in any new concept it was accommodated by the performances by leads. If we leave aside our notion of great script and universal nobility of subject  this is best fun film to come out in years. The plot is developed well to flourish two leading characters and dialogs though some will find it obnoxious are beautifully woven to develop the characters. Film subtly comments on the misogynisty and on the mindset of working class in 21st century. I will be not surprised if Melissa McCarthi's performance gets considered for Academy Awards. The scene where Detective Mullins place knife back into Ashburn's leg was hilarious and also the scene where Ashburn cuts throat of customer in restaurant was awfully hilarious. No harm guys in watching it for one time. It's a good comedy.".

	schema:headline " 'No concept of comedy' Bullock pairs with ubiquitously vulgar McCarthy in formulaic copbuddy flick";
	schema:reviewBody "Capitalizing on the success of 'Bridesmaids' Director Paul Feig once again employs his overweight over the top actress Melissa McCarthy in another gross out comedy. This time the foulmouthed McCarthy plays Detective Shannon Mullins of the Boston PD paired up with Sandra Bullock as a stuck up FBI Agent Sarah Ashburn. 'The Heat' is pretty much a formulaic copbuddy movie played mostly for laughs with some occasional violent detours.I'm happy to report that Sandra Bullock continues to delude herself that she has talent as a comic actress. You'll recall that she also was cast as an FBI agent in the much more entertaining 'Miss Confidentiality'. But here she's merely repeating her 'straw man' or should I say 'straw woman'? persona which was continually on depressing display in her earlier 2009 pseudocomic foray 'The Proposal'.The dictionary informs us that a 'straw man' is a fabricated or conveniently weak or innocuous person object matter etc. used as a seeming adversary or argument. In 'The Proposal' Bullock played a narcissistic editorinchief who was basically a klutz and totally incompetent in her social life. The same goes for her anal FBI agent hereconsider the obnoxious scene where she bungles an emergency tracheotomy. Ms. Bullock has an idea that exposing a character such as Special Agent Ashburn is funny. The problem is that no one can identify with such a character since they don't exist in real life. Can you really believe that such an incompetent character as Ashburn would rise through the ranks especially in such an organization as the FBI which prides itself on its training? And even if there were such a character as Bullock depicts here no one should be at all amused by such an unappealing character's comeuppance. Ashburn gives all 'alpha' men and women a bad name! McCarthy also has the same problem in that the idea of a ballbusting detective who intimidates her male superiors is simple wish fulfillment on the part of the film's scenarists. The way in which Captain Woods played by Thomas F. Wilsonthe actor who played 'Biff' in 'Back to the Future kowtows to Mullins is the opposite of the patriarchal subculture typically found in most police departments today. In other words it's too much of an exaggeration to take seriously. We see this from the outset when Mullins grabs a John's cell phone and calls his wife to humiliate him. Not only is this a grave violation of police procedure and conduct but we immediately regard Mullins' general lack of respect as off putting.Before encountering the villains of the piece Mullins gets to do battle with a couple of buffoonish petty criminals including one played by Marlon Wayans who all seem to be deathly afraid of the loose cannon police detective. Why should we laugh when again such scenarios are so detached from reality? You might have guessed that 'The Heat' moves along as the prim and proper Ashburn must rely on the street smarts of Mullins despite their mutual antipathy for one another. Along the way there are unfunny bits about 'Albino cops' and Boston accents. Too much time is taken up with Mullins' unlikeable family who mug for the camera every chance they get. You'll probably recognize Satruday Night Live veteran Jane Curtin in the thankless role as Mullins' churlish mother.

	onyx:emotionText "Capitalizing on the success of 'Bridesmaids' Director Paul Feig once again employs his overweight over the top actress Melissa McCarthy in another gross out comedy. This time the foulmouthed McCarthy plays Detective Shannon Mullins of the Boston PD paired up with Sandra Bullock as a stuck up FBI Agent Sarah Ashburn. 'The Heat' is pretty much a formulaic copbuddy movie played mostly for laughs with some occasional violent detours.I'm happy to report that Sandra Bullock continues to delude herself that she has talent as a comic actress. You'll recall that she also was cast as an FBI agent in the much more entertaining 'Miss Confidentiality'. But here she's merely repeating her 'straw man' or should I say 'straw woman'? persona which was continually on depressing display in her earlier 2009 pseudocomic foray 'The Proposal'.The dictionary informs us that a 'straw man' is a fabricated or conveniently weak or innocuous person object matter etc. used as a seeming adversary or argument. In 'The Proposal' Bullock played a narcissistic editorinchief who was basically a klutz and totally incompetent in her social life. The same goes for her anal FBI agent hereconsider the obnoxious scene where she bungles an emergency tracheotomy. Ms. Bullock has an idea that exposing a character such as Special Agent Ashburn is funny. The problem is that no one can identify with such a character since they don't exist in real life. Can you really believe that such an incompetent character as Ashburn would rise through the ranks especially in such an organization as the FBI which prides itself on its training? And even if there were such a character as Bullock depicts here no one should be at all amused by such an unappealing character's comeuppance. Ashburn gives all 'alpha' men and women a bad name! McCarthy also has the same problem in that the idea of a ballbusting detective who intimidates her male superiors is simple wish fulfillment on the part of the film's scenarists. The way in which Captain Woods played by Thomas F. Wilsonthe actor who played 'Biff' in 'Back to the Future kowtows to Mullins is the opposite of the patriarchal subculture typically found in most police departments today. In other words it's too much of an exaggeration to take seriously. We see this from the outset when Mullins grabs a John's cell phone and calls his wife to humiliate him. Not only is this a grave violation of police procedure and conduct but we immediately regard Mullins' general lack of respect as off putting.Before encountering the villains of the piece Mullins gets to do battle with a couple of buffoonish petty criminals including one played by Marlon Wayans who all seem to be deathly afraid of the loose cannon police detective. Why should we laugh when again such scenarios are so detached from reality? You might have guessed that 'The Heat' moves along as the prim and proper Ashburn must rely on the street smarts of Mullins despite their mutual antipathy for one another. Along the way there are unfunny bits about 'Albino cops' and Boston accents. Too much time is taken up with Mullins' unlikeable family who mug for the camera every chance they get. You'll probably recognize Satruday Night Live veteran Jane Curtin in the thankless role as Mullins' churlish mother. The comic tone is ruined when Ashburn and Mullins unhappily end up as witnesses to the murder of a drug dealer.

Anything with Sylvester Stallone is guaranteed to be your run of the mill cheesy action flick with guns explosions and cheesy one liners. This is exactly what this movie was but this time I enjoyed it from start to finish.First I'd like to say that Stallone's on screen chemistry with Sung Kang is awesome. The dialogue between is always laugh out loud. I don't think I've a movie where Stallone's sarcastic sense of humor just made me let out a loud yelp of laughter but this movie did. Kudos to the writer for writing all those comedic one liners every scene is guaranteed to make you giggle. Sung Kang was also enjoyable in his character of a determined yet rookie cop from out of state trying to solve a murder case. Reminded me of Jackie Chan in Rush Hour minus the strong accent. Also Jason Momoa besides being sexy did very well as the villain of the film. Towards the beginning he was a little one note but as the the film progresses he starts to show off more and more. The twist at the end definitely allowed him to get more shine and let the world know he can do more than just be Conan The Barbarian. The action in the movie was really enjoyable as well. There were times in the theater where all the watchers would cheer or let out a Damn or Wow because you literally could feel every punch kick slam shot and everything else. The ending fight scene was my fave. Some of the cinematography and shots seemed a little off being that the budget for this film was slightly high. But overall it's an enjoyable film. No complex script no Oscar worthy acting just a simple yet solid plot good action cheesy and funny one liners believable characters and not too long. I'd recommend this movie for all the true action lovers that don't always need a complex layered storyline. Just a fun action flick to watch on a Friday night with your buddies or maybe even date if you're girlfriend is into that type of stuff!".

	schema:headline " It almost feels like you've been thrown back in time to the 80s or early 90s!";
	schema:reviewBody "'BULLET TO THE HEAD' Four Stars Out of Five Sylvester Stallone in a classic 80s style revenge action film directed by none other than Walter Hill who helmed such popular 70s through 90s action flicks as 'THE WARRIORS' 'THE LONG RIDERS' '48 HOURS' 'RED HEAT' 'EXTREME PREJUDICE' 'TRESSPASS' and 'LAST MAN STANDING'. The film is based on a graphic novel of the same name when translated to English by Alexis Nolent and illustrated by Colin Wilson. It was scripted by Alessandro Camon and puts Stallone in a buddy tale as a hitman teamed with a cop out to revenge the killing of his partner. It also pits Stallone in a classic axe fight with Jason Momoa of 'STARGATE ATLANTIS' 'BAYWATCH' and 'GAME OF THRONES' fame. He also played Conan in the recent 'CONAN THE BARBARIAN' reboot. The film also costars Sung Kang most well known from 'THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS' franchise Christian Slater and Adewale AkinnuoyeAgbaje. It's a great throwback to 80s action flicks and Stallone and Hill fans should be thrilled with it.Stallone plays James Bonomo a hitman in New Orleans who takes an assignment to kill a dirty cop named Hank Greely Holt McCallany with his partner Louis Blanchard Jon Seda but leaves a witness alive a prostitute the cop was sleeping with named Lola Weronika Rosati. Bonomo and Blanchard are later attacked at a bar by another hired killer named Keegan Momoa. Keegan kills Blanchard but fails to defeat Bonomo in a bathroom brawl. Bonomo later learns that Keegan is working for a man named Robert Morel AkinnuoyeAgbaje who wants a file Greely had. Bonomo of course wants revenge for the death of his partner. A cop named Taylor Kwan Kang comes to town to investigate the death of his expartner Greely and pieces it together that Bonomo was involved. The two reluctantly team up to stop Morel and Keegan. The beautiful Sarah Shahi also costars as Bonomo's daughter who helps him out when Kwan is in need of medical attention because she's a tattoo artist.The film for me had exactly the same feel as the old neonoir revenge flicks from two to four decades ago the same ones that Stallone used to star in or Hill used to direct. While watching it it almost feels like you've been thrown back in time to the 80s or early 90s! It's just great nostalgic fun and Stallone is perfect in it. Kang makes a great sidekick and Momoa is an awesome bad guy. It's of course perfectly directed by Hill as well who hasn't changed at all in style in the last thirtysome years. The script isn't very deep and the lines are sometimes very cheesy but that's the way it's supposed to be.

	onyx:emotionText "'BULLET TO THE HEAD' Four Stars Out of Five Sylvester Stallone in a classic 80s style revenge action film directed by none other than Walter Hill who helmed such popular 70s through 90s action flicks as 'THE WARRIORS' 'THE LONG RIDERS' '48 HOURS' 'RED HEAT' 'EXTREME PREJUDICE' 'TRESSPASS' and 'LAST MAN STANDING'. The film is based on a graphic novel of the same name when translated to English by Alexis Nolent and illustrated by Colin Wilson. It was scripted by Alessandro Camon and puts Stallone in a buddy tale as a hitman teamed with a cop out to revenge the killing of his partner. It also pits Stallone in a classic axe fight with Jason Momoa of 'STARGATE ATLANTIS' 'BAYWATCH' and 'GAME OF THRONES' fame. He also played Conan in the recent 'CONAN THE BARBARIAN' reboot. The film also costars Sung Kang most well known from 'THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS' franchise Christian Slater and Adewale AkinnuoyeAgbaje. It's a great throwback to 80s action flicks and Stallone and Hill fans should be thrilled with it.Stallone plays James Bonomo a hitman in New Orleans who takes an assignment to kill a dirty cop named Hank Greely Holt McCallany with his partner Louis Blanchard Jon Seda but leaves a witness alive a prostitute the cop was sleeping with named Lola Weronika Rosati. Bonomo and Blanchard are later attacked at a bar by another hired killer named Keegan Momoa. Keegan kills Blanchard but fails to defeat Bonomo in a bathroom brawl. Bonomo later learns that Keegan is working for a man named Robert Morel AkinnuoyeAgbaje who wants a file Greely had. Bonomo of course wants revenge for the death of his partner. A cop named Taylor Kwan Kang comes to town to investigate the death of his expartner Greely and pieces it together that Bonomo was involved. The two reluctantly team up to stop Morel and Keegan. The beautiful Sarah Shahi also costars as Bonomo's daughter who helps him out when Kwan is in need of medical attention because she's a tattoo artist.The film for me had exactly the same feel as the old neonoir revenge flicks from two to four decades ago the same ones that Stallone used to star in or Hill used to direct. While watching it it almost feels like you've been thrown back in time to the 80s or early 90s! It's just great nostalgic fun and Stallone is perfect in it. Kang makes a great sidekick and Momoa is an awesome bad guy. It's of course perfectly directed by Hill as well who hasn't changed at all in style in the last thirtysome years. The script isn't very deep and the lines are sometimes very cheesy but that's the way it's supposed to be. I enjoyed it more than 'EXPENDABLES' costars of Stallone's latest action vehicles Schwarzenegger's 'THE LAST STAND' and Statham's 'PARKER' which came out in theaters weeks apart from each other. They all underperformed greatly at the box office especially this one but people are idiots and have poor taste in movies also all three will kill on video.

However I do enjoy the retrocheesy 80's feel this movie has.Overall the film is average but watchable. Thats because of the StalloneHill combination and the action throughout.Comparing it to another similar retro action film from an ageing action star in early 2013 The Last StandI felt that the last stand was more fun and enjoyable.

	schema:reviewBody "I'd start this review off with a strong Sylvester Stallone is back but it's just not true. He's very much been in the limelight recently. The 67year old actor won't be held down by his age. After a 3year hiatus back in 2003 he returned to the ring by acting in and directing Rocky Balboa. Not content to just revisit one of his most wellknown characters Stallone also put the headband back on for a fourth helping of First Blood in Rambo.James Bonomo Sylvester Stallone is a New Orleans hitman whose partner Jon Seda was just murdered in a doublecross. Washington D.C. detective Taylor Kwan Sung Kang is sent to Louisiana's capital city to investigate the death of his former colleague Holt McCallany. Bonomo and Kwan form an unlikely alliance after they discover the two killings are somehow linked.After the two starfilled Expendables films Stallone obviously felt it was time to test his merit as a oneman show with Bullet to the Head. Unfortunately audiences didn't respond so well to his first solo outing as an action antihero. It's a real shame because the movie is an entertaining return to the highoctane and high body count days of the 1980s and 1990s.I'm not saying Bullet to the Head features only Stallone providing all the excitement. It's very much a buddycop film and costar Kang provides plenty of thrills himself. Nonetheless Stallone is obviously the one carrying all the star power.We can debate all day whether he's right or wrong in his use of steroids. Let's just talk about the surface issue here. Stallone looks darn good for a guy who could be a greatgrandfather. He's ripped and his upper body resembles a King Cobra about to strike. He doesn't look halfbad in a fitted threepiece suit either.Stallone does what he does best in Bullet to the Head. He plays a tough guy with a calm demeanor who doesn't say much. Instead he lets his fists and guns do the talking. He might have a stunt double that does all his fighting for him but Stallone still moves effortlessly in every scene. You never stop once to ask whether Director Walter Hill yelled cut and put someone else in to fight Jason Momoa or any of the other guys his character gets into scraps with.Director Walter Hill uses Bullet to the Head as a reminder to audiences that he once made violent action films like this for a living. He's the same guy who gave us such classic popcorn flicks as both the 48 Hrs. movies The Warriors Red Heat and others. I'm not going to say that this is better or worse than any of those films but it's an enjoyable way to blow 90minutes after a hard day at work or on a Saturday afternoon.Bullet to the Head works hard to earn its R rating. Like any good action film from the 1980s there's plenty of violence. The blood spray from gunshot wounds and actual on screen carnage is much heavier here though. There's also plenty of nudity and loads of bad language. Its everything one would expect from these types of movies.If it weren't for the cell phones and computers Bullet to the Head could easily be mistaken for any of the great action movies of the 1980s and 1990s. The Louisiana setting is a welcome change from the typical LA or New York City locales we see in these movies. There are points where things get a bit predictable but instead of being annoying they provide a warm feeling of nostalgia.".

But as far as I am concerned there should be a second name plastered right alongside Mr. Stallone's. The extra credit is not ironically enough for the Korean actor Sung Kang even though he is very good but instead the film's director. I walked into Bullet to the Head with an open mind hoping that Mr. Stallone could keep up the good track record he's had in the last couple of years the last Rambo and both of the Expendables movies but when I saw the words 'directed by Walter Hill' in the opening credits I knew I was in for a good time.It's a little hard to believe that this is the first time these two men have worked alongside one another since they've both made their names doing the same general sorts of movies and both have been kicking around Hollywood for roughly the same length of time. Better late than never for even though Bullet to the Head is a little rougher than it might be thanks to Mr. Stallone's charisma and Mr. Hill's sure hand for coordinating action this movie does pack a walloping punch.No time is wasted the movie gets rolling within the first ten minutes. From the start of things we know who our protagonist is we know the central bad guy is and we know there will be plenty of grisly action sequences. Mr. Stallone and Mr. Kang do have a lot of deliberately amusing moments together most of the laughs collected whenever they are driving from one seedy New Orleans location to another bickering about ethics the justice system the difference between Japanese and Koreans and Mr. Stallone's relationship to a sassy tattoo artist played by Sarah Shahi. The villains in the picture are also delightfully selfindulgent the 'brain' behind the whole operation which involves the balance of power between organized crime and the justice system is a crippled man whose signature line is Never trust a man who doesn't care about money. The subject man is the expected big muscleman with a smirk Jason Momoa a walking mountain of a man who walks in and shoots up an entire bar for little reason other than pleasure.But what really makes the movie is what Walter Hill has always been a virtuoso at excellent fight scenes. Mr. Hill sets up his camera at many creative angles. My personal favorite being an overhead shot of Mr. Stallone and Mr. Momoa as they duke it out in a restroom with one of them being slammed bodily through the stall door and knocking the whole thing down. The camera is also frequently set with wider shots so we can see more than just a splitsecond now and then of a fist hitting what we perceive to be somebody's stomach. There is also a great shot where Mr. Kang punches somebody in the mouth and the man's spittle is caught in an overhead light and shows up as an array of brilliant white specks. Every sort of weapon from handguns to outdated firefighter axes is used at some point and just as the title hints there are plenty of moments where somebody catches a muzzle blast clean through the forehead. It's exactly the sort of suspension of disbelief that a movie like this needs a character will waste three or four shots hitting their target in the chest and stomach when as they demonstrate subsequently they planned all along to put a fatal round between the eyes.There's also lots of fun imagery such as an underwater shot where Mr. Stallone stares down at the submerged body of a man he just killed and drops the murder weapon right down on top of us. Or a delightfully funny moment where Jason Momoa's head pops out of a scuzzy pond like something from a 1950s sciencefiction flick.Bullet to the Head was a nice surprise an out of the blue teaming up of two actionmovie veterans. Admittedly the story needs some refining and there are a couple of moments where a key shot seems to be missing during a climax a man falls from a rafter and just as he hits the ground we cut to another scene. A reaction shot would have evened things out and given the scene a more completed feel. But this is a nice kickstart to the new year of the three movies I've seen in 2013 thus farand all have been actionorientatedthis is the one I would encourage people to see more than once. I have a hankering to see it again myself as a matter of fact.".

	schema:reviewBody "2013 has already brought back two of the coolest if not the coolest action heroes Schwarzenegger and now Stallone. The funny thing about it all is that Stallone already had his returning movie last year with the Expendables 2 as it mainly focused around him. Anyways the trailer to the movie as many may have said looked absolutely horrible and I didn't really have any intention of seeing this despite Stallone being my second favorite action star. Now I'm kinda glad I saw it The film is based around Stallone's character James who is on a rampage to avenge the death of his fellow partner who was killed. Now the story line has been done to death but there is an alliance formed which was kinda cool. The most important thing about this movie is that it isn't trying to take the story far too seriously but keeps it important and is actually very good if you look at it.The acting in the movie can be both good and crap but we really don't care much about the acting. Its about the action and having fun and the film knows itself. It actually brings us back to the 80's Stallone we used to love and is really cool! Sure there is plenty of bad dialogue but no one really cares about that neither with any of the other flaws all for a legit reason because the film knows what it is.There is plenty of digital blood which is now commonly used in all action movies and can sometimes get a tad frustrating but is not a big issue.Overall I can say that this movie is made for Stallone fans! Worth a watch!".

	onyx:emotionText "2013 has already brought back two of the coolest if not the coolest action heroes Schwarzenegger and now Stallone. The funny thing about it all is that Stallone already had his returning movie last year with the Expendables 2 as it mainly focused around him. Anyways the trailer to the movie as many may have said looked absolutely horrible and I didn't really have any intention of seeing this despite Stallone being my second favorite action star. Now I'm kinda glad I saw it The film is based around Stallone's character James who is on a rampage to avenge the death of his fellow partner who was killed.

These kind of films hold a special place in my heart so naturally I would be sold on this film. Despite all the action clichs there is no resisting the hardcore action the explosions and all the guys getting beat up.This film which of course has to be directed by Walter Hill is about an aging hitman named Jimmy Bobo who was betrayed after he performed a job and his partner was killed. Seeking revenge he teams up with a cop named Taylor Kwon as they both seek out justice. But these two have a different way of serving justice.If you're expecting Oscarcaliber acting then don't watch this film. You don't need that kind of acting in a film like this. Sylvester Stallone is nearing 70 and it's neat to see him efficiently take down people more than half his age. Sung Kang known for his role in Fast and the Furious films was decent. Jason Momoa is an effective badass as Keegan the guy hunting down Bobo. There is also a welcome return to the big screen by Christian Slater who was drunkingly funny.Overall there is nothing new with Bullet to the Head. But I can promise a fun ride and Sly kicking butt. This is definitely an adrenaline rush and action junkies will be sure to enjoy this. It's a shame people don't watch these kind of films anymore because they are good. I rate this film 910.".

	schema:reviewBody "With this movie Stallone is back and in surprisingly good shape. That is a good thing since the enjoyment of this movie is pretty much Stallone and not much else. If you are not a Stallone fan you are most likely not going to enjoy this movie.I cannot help making a comparison to Arnold Schwarzenegger's comeback movie The Last Stand. These films are quite different in approach. In The Last Stand Schwarzenegger was playing his age and not trying to be all gung ho I'm back and still feel young. The script however was quite okay. I had my reservations about certain parts but at least someone had put some effort into it.This movie well Stallone is indeed back and he is truly kicking ass. To my surprise he actually manages to pull it off. I loved every minute of Stallone being on screen. However for this movie someone must have misplaced the real script and quickly thrown something together in order to get 90 minutes of screen time for Stallone. The story well let us just say that I am not impressed. It is pretty much just there in the background to tie together the various action scenes. Not much thought seems to have gone into it. Especially the ending is quite disappointing and seems very rushed.Some people have complained about the violence. Well what did you guys expect? It is a Stallone comeback movie. If you are going to be upset about violence then do not watch Stallone movies. Personally I enjoyed the action sequences with Stallone as well as the ones wit he bad guy's hired mercenary. Actually I quite liked this hired mercenary. I made for a suitably impressive adversary. The real bad guys behind himmeh. The black guy was okayish though at least until the end when it all went a bit silly.The Korean cop Taylor Kwon was mostly just silly and dumb. He constantly screwed up and his silly whispering sessions over the phone where he was unknowingly since he was so bloody stupid telling the bad guys everything made me squirm in my chair.The end? Well that was indeed a bit of a disappointment as I said. Kind of okay let's quickly get everyone out of the way as in dead so that we can get on with the final fight between Stallone and the mercenary. I mean the bad guy mastermind suddenly turns into a total idiot? Could they not have found some more intelligent way to finish him off? The final axefight was somewhat cool though.Bottom line I enjoyed the movie quite a lot but that was pretty much only because of Stallone and action sequences. I was quite surprised at how well Stallone managed to make a comeback as an action hero. It is really a shame that quite a few other things where just sloppily done or botched up since this could have been a really great movie. Now it is just good and if you are not a Stallone person then it probably just weighs in as okay or even mediocre.".

Jimi doesn't believe Kwon that his phone is the best thing since sliced bread download everything there is to know about Jimi and show him.

About 10 or 20 minutes in just in case you can't figure out what is going on Christian Slater gives a monologue that explains exactly why the bad guys are bad what their evil plan is and gives the JamesBondvillain'ssidekickesque bad guy his orders. So if you were confused before there is no need now.There is so much bad in this film that I am just going to skip to the end. Kwon hooking up with Lisa was quite obvious from the start. The big showdown too. Khal Drogo's desire to end it all through oneonone combat with fire axes was stupid and obviously going to result in his own death not forgetting that as soon as you saw Jimi take the knife off of Jon Seda in the beginning you knew that would be the weapon that would perform the finishing blow to Khal Drogo. Jimi and Kwon still not being friends at the end was also plain to see.The only things that saved this film from having me fall asleep were not wanting to miss Sarah Shahi and some interesting cinematography in some points. The black and white opening scene was kind of cool.All in all I feel my rating is a bit generous. But I gave 1 star because I can't go lower 1 star for Sarah Shahi whom I love and one star for a few moments of vaguely interesting cinematography.".

	schema:headline " Rambo Meets the New Conan!!!";
	schema:reviewBody "Watching the Sylvester Stallone shoot'em up Bullet to the Head felt like a blast from the past. This polished but predictable anthology of action movie clichs contains several Rrated closequarters combat scenes with sufficient amounts of blood splatter and gore some highoctane fireball explosions lots of snappy tough guy banter and surprising displays of frontal female nudity. Half the scenes reminded me of producer Joel Silver's explosive slambang whiteknuckled testosteroneladen tales such as Conspiracy Theory Exit Wounds Swordfish and his Lethal Weapon franchise. Indeed Silver serves as one of the producers and Bullet to the Head adheres to his formula. Meanwhile action auteur Walter Hill drew the other half from his hardboiled melodramas. For the record Hill helmed the two 48 Hrs flicks with Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy Extreme Prejudice with Nick Nolte Last Man Standing with Bruce Willis and Red Heat costarring Arnold Schwarzenegger and James Belushi. Although The Messenger scenarist Alessandro Camon adapted the Alexis Nolent graphic novel Du plomb dans la tte Bullet to the Head looks like 48 Hrs andor Red Heat clone. Mind you Bullet to the Head is Hill's first theatrical release since his gritty 2002 prison melodrama Undisputed with Ving Rhames and Wesley Snipes. During his absence from the big screen Hill helmed the premiere episode of HBO's Deadwood and then the television miniseries western Broken Trail 2006 costarring Robert Duvall and Thomas Haden Church. In many respects this actionpacked largely straightforward odd couple buddy picture compares favorably with earlier exceptional Stallone sagas like Assassins The Specialist and Demolition Man. Most definitely it surpasses Tango and Cash and Stop Or My Mom Will Shoot. Cast as a seasoned hitman in the Crescent City Sylvester Stallone tangles with a mysterious cabal of Big Easy investors who have the New Orleans Police Department on their payroll. Director Walter Hill has juggled the occupations of the protagonists from his earlier buddy picture epics. The cop was always the lead in the combo in the 48 Hrs movies and Red Heat. This time around worldweary career criminal James Bobo Bonomo Sylvester Stallone of Rocky is the lead while saintly Washington D.C. Detective Taylor Kwon Sung Kang of Fast  Furious behaves rather naively and relies too much on his cell phone. Ironically the two men want to exact vengeance for the deaths of their former partners. They agree to form an uneasy alliance but Kwon's conscience prompts him to constrain Bonomo. These two don't immediately run into each other. When the plot unfolds Bonomo and his partner Louis Blanchard Jon Seda of Bad Boys 2 masquerade as cops to snuff a cocainesnorting thug Hank Greely Holt McCallany of Fight Club in a motel room. Bonomo spots a tattooed prostitute cowering in the shower but he lets her live. This amoral murderer draws the line at shooting women. When he is behind the wheel on the road he swerves to avoid stray cats in front of him. It's bad luck he assures Louis. These two show up at a crowded bar where they are supposed to pick up the balance of their loot for the shooting. Before either realizes they have been doublecrossed another assassin Keegan Jason Momoa of Conan stabs poor Louis repeatedly to death in front of everybody. He wields a small blade to hack both of Louis' lungs so nobody in the noisy bar knows a murder has occurred. Keegan isn't quite as lucky with Bonomo. Now Bonomo wants payback. Our hero crosses paths with a hardnosed Washington D.C. police detective who is visiting New Orleans. As it turns out Hank Greely was his former partner in Washington. Kwon wants the people who ordered Hank's demise. Sure neither Bonomo nor Kwon have much use for each other initially but they kind of grow on one other as they survive backtoback fracases.Hill stages some gripping shootout scenes that genre fans will savor and you get to see Silver's trademark KaBoom explosions! Hill never lets the narrative bog down in aimless chatter or an over elaborate plot. Stallone's character provides deadpan narration throughout the pyrotechnics so you never take anything seriously in Bullet to the Head. Bullet to the Head is not unlike a Tarantino thriller. Camon and Hill wrap up everything but leave room for a sequel since the hero's daughter and the D.C. cop are dating. At 66 years of age Sylvester Stallone appears as fit as a fiddle. This is the kind of movie where guys shed shirts and clash muscles. He channels a little bit of Rocky in his tongueincheek performance. The ax fight between beefy musclebound Jason Momoa and Stallone has been carefully edited to present both to maximum advantage. You know Stallone is going to triumph but Momoa doesn't make it look easy. Momoa makes a lusty villain. No less villainous is Adewale AkinnuoyeAgbaje as a crippled African investor has no qualms about murder. Christian Slater appears briefly as a smarmy swindler with a flash drive around his neck that boasts the goods of everybody. The interrogation scene is pretty amusing. Clocking in at a lean mean 97 minutes Bullet to the Head doesn't wear out its welcome. You don't even have to wait around to see what's after the end credits so you can clear out early. Were it not for the pedigree talent involved Bullet to the Head would qualify at best as a sevenstar rather than a tenstar movie. If you still like Stallone you'll love Bullet to the Head because it is worth shelling out the bucks to watch this Spartan saga.".

	onyx:emotionText "Watching the Sylvester Stallone shoot'em up Bullet to the Head felt like a blast from the past. This polished but predictable anthology of action movie clichs contains several Rrated closequarters combat scenes with sufficient amounts of blood splatter and gore some highoctane fireball explosions lots of snappy tough guy banter and surprising displays of frontal female nudity. Half the scenes reminded me of producer Joel Silver's explosive slambang whiteknuckled testosteroneladen tales such as Conspiracy Theory Exit Wounds Swordfish and his Lethal Weapon franchise. Indeed Silver serves as one of the producers and Bullet to the Head adheres to his formula. Meanwhile action auteur Walter Hill drew the other half from his hardboiled melodramas. For the record Hill helmed the two 48 Hrs flicks with Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy Extreme Prejudice with Nick Nolte Last Man Standing with Bruce Willis and Red Heat costarring Arnold Schwarzenegger and James Belushi. Although The Messenger scenarist Alessandro Camon adapted the Alexis Nolent graphic novel Du plomb dans la tte Bullet to the Head looks like 48 Hrs andor Red Heat clone. Mind you Bullet to the Head is Hill's first theatrical release since his gritty 2002 prison melodrama Undisputed with Ving Rhames and Wesley Snipes. During his absence from the big screen Hill helmed the premiere episode of HBO's Deadwood and then the television miniseries western Broken Trail 2006 costarring Robert Duvall and Thomas Haden Church. In many respects this actionpacked largely straightforward odd couple buddy picture compares favorably with earlier exceptional Stallone sagas like Assassins The Specialist and Demolition Man. Most definitely it surpasses Tango and Cash and Stop Or My Mom Will Shoot. Cast as a seasoned hitman in the Crescent City Sylvester Stallone tangles with a mysterious cabal of Big Easy investors who have the New Orleans Police Department on their payroll. Director Walter Hill has juggled the occupations of the protagonists from his earlier buddy picture epics. The cop was always the lead in the combo in the 48 Hrs movies and Red Heat. This time around worldweary career criminal James Bobo Bonomo Sylvester Stallone of Rocky is the lead while saintly Washington D.C. Detective Taylor Kwon Sung Kang of Fast  Furious behaves rather naively and relies too much on his cell phone. Ironically the two men want to exact vengeance for the deaths of their former partners. They agree to form an uneasy alliance but Kwon's conscience prompts him to constrain Bonomo. These two don't immediately run into each other. When the plot unfolds Bonomo and his partner Louis Blanchard Jon Seda of Bad Boys 2 masquerade as cops to snuff a cocainesnorting thug Hank Greely Holt McCallany of Fight Club in a motel room. Bonomo spots a tattooed prostitute cowering in the shower but he lets her live. This amoral murderer draws the line at shooting women. When he is behind the wheel on the road he swerves to avoid stray cats in front of him. It's bad luck he assures Louis. These two show up at a crowded bar where they are supposed to pick up the balance of their loot for the shooting. Before either realizes they have been doublecrossed another assassin Keegan Jason Momoa of Conan stabs poor Louis repeatedly to death in front of everybody.

This won't get any awards but the film is well made and the performances from the actors are good enough to move the story between the action scenes. The action is brutal and my main man Sly gives one of his toughest  most badass performances to date. Even though this is'nt doing well at the box office  Bullet To The Head will find its audience and most likely achieve cult status .

	schema:headline " A sloppy and outdated return for Stallone and Hill";
	schema:reviewBody "n the 1970s and 80s Sylvester Stallone and director Walter Hill dominated the cinematic scene with various action films and buddy comedies. Their latest film Bullet to the Head attempts to recapture the spirit of the 80s but ends up feeling outdated never attempting to reinvent or modernise this type of film.In the New Orleans underworld James Bonomo Stallone a.k.a. Jimmy Bobo is a hitman who lives by a certain code of ethics he does not kill women or children. After Jimmy's partner Louis Jon Seda is killed by a ruthless mercenary Jason Momoa Jimmy wants revenge. He finds an unusual ally in the form of Detective Taylor Kwon Sung Kang and their investigation leads to a wider conspiracy involving an African gangster Adewale AkinnouyeAgbaje and network of corrupt politicians and police officers.Hill is best known for director 48 Hours and the cult classic The Warriors and producing the Alien films. With Bullet to the Head he brings in a neonoir style filled with dark neon visuals and uses a brooding Stallone voiceover. But on the whole Bullet to the Head is a dull predictable experience. For a film that is led by one of the biggest action stars in the world the action is infrequent and when it is on screen its quick cuts and closeup shots make it hard to tell what's going on.The screenplay is ordinary  featuring plot points that you will see coming from a mile away. Bullet to the Head is such a predictable film that despite the graphic violence you'll see it'll likely leave your audience bored.It was clear that Hill and Stallone wanted to make a film similar to Cobra but what we get is a film that treats itself too seriously. It's a film that needed to be let loose but it played more as an investigation film with some buddy comedy elements as Bobo and Taylor quest around the city. The film is the most fun when Momoa is in full killer mode.The buddy relationship between Bobo and Taylor plays on three levels  profession age and race. Both men argue about their methods  Bobo's willingness to kill and use violence differs greatly from Taylor's lawabiding view on the justice. The other element is Bobo's use of oldfashioned methods relying on his knife compared to Taylor's reliance on his cell phone. The writing attempts to give the pair a witty rapport and it does provide the laughs as the film constantly sides with Bobo.Despite Stallone's resurgence as an actor Bullet to the Head is a step back for him. He offers a lazy performance that's meant as a throwback to his films of the 80s films that took themselves too seriously. The acting across the board actually is subpar but AkinnouyeAgbaje's performance was particularly embarrassing as a gangster limping around on crutches. It was really a role meant for an older actor.On the whole Bullet of the Head attempts to be a stylish throwback a film that wanted to bring the grimy thrillers of the 1980s to the internet age. But what we have is a sloppy film that will disappoint people who want a fun Bmovie. Stallone and Hill have made better films in the past and if you think you're interested in Bullet to the Head you might want to check one of those older films instead. Stallone certainly needs to step away from this type of movie if he wants to expand his career from his existing franchises.Please visit www.entertainmentfuse.com".

Woody Allen is more macho than this guy and is a cop who buddies up with Stallone!The nudity literally epitomizes gratuitousness as does the violence.That being said I thought Stallone actually was good in this film he just didn't have a lot to go on.The film did have some high points  Stallone did get to say some funny one liners one of the bad guys there were actually THREE in this film! was pretty good and the last fight scene was ALMOST worth sitting through the rest of the film.. Almost..There just wasn't anything really to this film. No plot. no characters. Nothing that made a lot of sense. Unlikable characters. Weak costars.I kept on thinking why was this film made?I really can't believe my wife and I paid 20 to see this.For a 1.50 redbox rental it would be a very weak recommendation.To pay top money to see this in a theater?My opinion  see something else.".

But this movie is NOTHING in the league of 'red heat' or any of sly's other 80's movies. There's somethings quite irritating about this movie the dialog the acting and the story line. I don't mind unrealistic story lines but the story line of 'bullet to the head' was appalling.it felt like a bullet to the head to keep on watching. So i stopped at the point where the boat house was bombed.".

This is a rather curious film because it's not really the plot which interests youbut only the characters. The actual search for the murderer's identity and his whole motivation is mediocre but the dialogues between the two journalists are very wit and cleverly written. They constantly try to overtrump each other which results in scenes that are both funny and emotional. The supportive characters are very enchanting as well particularly the hysterical housemaid Lillian Harmer and the overly shy policeassistant Wilfred. A Shriek in the Night might not be the most memorable murdermystery of the 1930's but it's definitely worth a look in case you're a fan of classic primitive cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "A very funny and quite well made poverty row whodunnit from 1932 this pairing of Ginger Rogers and Lyle Talbot might have just set the ideas in motion for THE THIN MAN series at MGM a year later. I think this film was made at the Tiffany Studio in 1932 just as this company ceased production.... or just after...this is exactly the sort of film they made especially with very snazzy overstuffed deco furniture and solid clunky sound and production values. Credits say it is made by Allied Productions which nobody has ever heard of or from so my guess as a faux Tiffany Production might be right. The 1929 Tiffany film PARTY GIRL is made in exactly the same way and with the same solid look and quality sets. Ginger and Lyle also seen in the 'haunted' Monogram pic from the same year THE THIRTEENTH GUEST offer a smart alec couple making verbal quips and asides and leave the audience well pleased in their natural delivery and likable sparring. This film is well directed with a refreshing and timeless modern style. SHREIK IN THE NIGHT is essentially a haunted house movie set in a skyscraper penthouse and for lovers of pre code goofiness and sexual antics and even prohibition speakeasy asides leaves a 2005 viewer with a knowing smile that someone 73 years ago was tuned into long lasting imagery and dialogue. One scene in a cellar with a furnace is particularly creepy and if seen in a 3000 seat movie palace in 1932 must have caused huge screams and genuine shrieks! This is great fun well made and 'modern' and shows that if Tiffany had survived they might have outlasted even Grand National Pictures  which I strongly suspect was their successor  and partly ultimately the reformed 1937 Monogram and certainly PRC ...which I can track as their location and later name. It's a good film made under what I would think was swiftly changing technology and times. The direction and dialogue and delivery has certainly successfully stood the test of time.".

	schema:reviewBody "A SHRIEK IN THE NIGHT Allied Pictures 1933 directed by Albert Ray reunites Ginger Rogers and Lyle Talbot of THE THIRTEENTH GUEST Monogram 1932 in another mystery thriller.Following the opening credits the story begins at night with a view of an apartment building obviously a miniature model followed by the sound of a scream an overhead view of a man's body obviously a dummy falling down from the penthouse above and landing on the sidewalk below. The incident immediately draws a crowd which awakens a janitor Harvey Clark whose residence is in the basement level to be awaken from the noise to soon come outside to hark the identity of the body as Mr. Harker! Enter the police Inspector Russell Purnell B. Pratt whose philosophy is I'm an inspector and I can say anything I want and his assistant the dimwitted Wilfred Alfred Hoyt who arrive at the scene of the crime at 921 Lake Street to investigate whether the death of the penthouse millionaire to be suicide or murder. Russell and Wilfred soon encounter a young girl named Patricia Morgan Ginger Rogers acting as Harker's secretary but in reality is a reporter for the Morning News out to get a story following a hunch regarding Harker's association with a racketeer named Josephus Martini Maurice Black. Also there to outscoop Pat is Ted Rand Lyle Talbot of the Daily Express who becomes responsible for Pat's getting fired by Perkins her editor Clarence Wilson for accidentally telephoning her own story to Ted believing him on the extension to be the rewrite man from her paper. Hoping to redeem herself and solve Harker's murder Pat continues to investigate only to encounter more killings before she herself becomes the murder victim by nearly being placed in a blazing incinerator.The supporting cast includes Lillian Harmer as Augusta the shrieking maid who not only enjoys reading mystery magazines but adds to the confusion with her bewilderment Louise Beavers with surname billed in the credits as Beaver as the black maid who also shrieks after finding a body of a man named Colby in one of the apartments and Cyril Ring among others whose names have gone uncredited.A mystery melodrama that combines the elements of mystery and comedy A SHRIEK IN THE NIGHT which may not be in the higher league had it been directed by Alfred Hitchcock does have some potential in spite of its low budget values. Lacking background mood music to add to suspense fine moments include a shadowy figure seen through the silhouette on the wall listening to the telephone extension as certain characters especially the two main characters are conversing their thoughts about the Harker case. Maurice Black as the stereotypical Italian gangster and secretive loner also residing in the apartment building also adds to the mystery. While THE THIRTEENTH GUEST is better known of the two Rogers and Talbot collaborations A SHRIEK IN THE NIGHT has had more exposure on late night cable and local public television stations during the 1980s. Because of similarities A SHRIEK IN THE NIGHT is sometimes mistaken as a sequel to THE THIRTEENTH GUEST. It's interesting to point out that Ginger Rogers uses the same surname of Morgan in both films as well as belting out a scream or two when confronted by the unidentified killer. As a public domain title A SHRIEK IN THE NIGHT has been distributed through various video manufacturers including one company that used a more glamorous 1940s looking picture of Ginger Rogers on the storage box in spite that this is an early 1930s film that at times due to sporadic echoes with the dialog and some poor lighting plays like something right out of 1930. Whether its the film itself or the aging process is uncertain but restoration in sound and clearer picture quality might help. The fact that A SHRIEK IN THE NIGHT presents a youthful yet almost unrecognizable and slightly brunettishblonde Rogers in a poverty row production sporting some unattractive gowns designed by Alberta shortly before her acclaimed popularity at RKO Radio and association with Fred Astaire in those lavish dance musicals through most of the 1930s her quick and sassy oneliners and lovehate relationship with rival reporter Talbot while solving a mystery manage to keep the pace going during its 66 minutes of screen time.".

The fact that A SHRIEK IN THE NIGHT presents a youthful yet almost unrecognizable and slightly brunettishblonde Rogers in a poverty row production sporting some unattractive gowns designed by Alberta shortly before her acclaimed popularity at RKO Radio and association with Fred Astaire in those lavish dance musicals through most of the 1930s her quick and sassy oneliners and lovehate relationship with rival reporter Talbot while solving a mystery manage to keep the pace going during its 66 minutes of screen time.";

The two reporters try to mislead and trick each other even as both are trying to solve the murders.Most of the story is rather slowmoving but towards the end things start to happen quickly and it is worth waiting for.

Pat's on a story to connect Harker to racketeer Joe Martini Maurice Blackwho happens to live in the same building gets more then she bargained for with Harker flying out of his apartment window to his death. Later on the floor under him a Mrs.Coby is found murdered and her husband is later found floating in the river an apparent suicide.Police inspector RussellPurnell Pratt finds evidence that Harker was actually in the Coby's apartment when he fell or jumped to his death and deduces that it was Mr. Coby who found Harker and Mrs. Coby together and in a jealous rage killed both of them then and later committed suicide. Of course as we know from seeing the obvious in movies like this the truth about Harker and the Coby's death is far more stranger then at first thought. Pretty good movie that has it share of comedy in it to get the audience a bit relaxed until the final few minutes. When it's found out who really is responsible for the murders with Pat almost burned to a cinder by the killer in the buildings basement incinerator. What's a bit odd about the movie is that the killer was really trying to avenge his innocent brothers execution as both Harker and Martini had him set up and railroaded to take the rap for a murder that they committed a number of years ago. The killer got a little too carried away by killing the Coby's who had nothing to do with his brothers death by trying to throw off the police from suspecting him.Worth watching because unlike many movies made back then in the early 1930's it has the feel of a film made much later with the sound and photography and most of all the actors acting more natural. Not acting like their on the stage and having to throw their voices and enunciate every word to make sure that everyone in the theater hears exactly what their saying. Like in most films made in the early years of talkies.".

	schema:reviewBody "This 66 minute 1933 movie starring the 22 year old Ginger Rogers and Lyle Talbot is an excellent representation of prefilm noire of its era. This was Rogers' 20 film but the wise crackingendearing personality that she eventually developed for the Astaire movies had not yet appeared. She comes off stiff and unsure. Leading man Lyle Talbot a veteran of almost 200 movies plays as Ginger's rival reporter and a romance that started before this movie began blossoms despite some backstabbing by each of the other. Talbot is excellent and carries the show. Notable performances are given by Pernell Pratt as the police detective and Harvey Clark as the janitor. Actress Louise Beavers who went on to make more than 160 films many notable plays the stereotypical negro. The roll can be excused as it is a benchmark of the Hollywood problems of the times. The story an excellent whodunnit written by Francis Hyland and Kurt Kempler is good but gets muddled at the end. Even so it does not interfere with the understanding of the plot. There is a scene at the end that has gruesome implications but is not gratuitous and therefore adds to the depth of the story. One gaff I noticed about 5 minutes into the picture Rogers is talking to the detective. She is smoking a cigarette there's a lot of smoking going on through out the film and he is smoking a cigar. While holding the smoking butt she leaves the room only to enter another room sans cigarette. It is very interesting to see the styles of dress and automobiles of the times. Many of the shots were outdoors. The camera work is some what stilted and has only a few pans. It is almost like a theater play. I saw this film from the 50 Movie Pack Horror Classics box. Well worth buying and this film is nottobemissed.".

The plot is rather complex even though the killer's identity could be guessed relatively soon through obvious clues.. the finger in pointed in one direction early and never relinquishes it so I think that's a failure in Albert Ray's work as director not to produce effective red herrings that would keep us guessing. As a Ginger Rogers movie I do think it succeeds but that could be because I personally love her in practically everything. And the unflappable extremely likable Talbot lends great support. Some of the comedy bits with the housekeeper..and another black stereotype played by Louise Beavers the maid frightened of morgues and dead people is provided for AfricanAmericans to cringeare really irritating though. Those accustomed with cinema at this time can probably adjust to the dead air that often exists making scenes between characters seem like lengthly affairs.".

She isn't so glamorouswith her hair and makeup looking more ordinary. This isn't to say she looked badit's just that her Hollywood image wasn't yet set in stone.She is ably supported by a young and handsome Lyle Talbotwho was very good though his career soon seemed to come to a standstillcursed to star in mostly 3rd rate productions during the bulk of his career such as his being in PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE. In addition there are a few funny support characters the maid and the police detective that are amazingly dumb and the butt of a lot of jokes.The film is a nice little murder mystery with Ginger being a reporter posing as the murdered man's secretary. There's a lot more to it than that but if I tell it would spoil the suspense. I only want to point out that I thought the identity of the murderer was excellentit wasn't someone you'd immediately guess.

The first person questioned is the dead man's secretary she claims to have no idea what happened and suggests the police talk to the maid however she does warn them that the is a little dumb. The maid claims she may have heard a hissing noise but isn't certain. As the police discuss matters a reporter Ted Rand bluffs his way into the apartment he isn't the first reporter there though the secretary. Pat Morgan is actually a reporter too. She had been investigating her employer and knew a lot more than she told the police. Unfortunately for her as the calls in the story she doesn't realise she is telling the story to her rival on the other phone rather than her paper. She gets the sack and is determined to get her revenge on Rand who she was once involved with.As the story progresses more people die and motives start to emerge. It seems the dead man was involved with the woman in the apartment below and when she is found dead suspicion falls on the husband although there are other dodgy characters about including the mob. As Morgan digs deeper into the story she puts herself in real danger.At just over an hour in length this film doesn't outstay its welcome. There is a nice mystery with a reasonable number of suspects. While it is listed as a comedy it is better to think of it as a drama with a few comical moments as there are few real laughs to be hadif you don't include some of the overacting by secondary characters! Leads Ginger Rogers and Lyle Talbot are likable as Morgan and Rand. Given the fairly light tone to much of the film its ending gets quite dark it looked as though Morgan was going to be incinerated by the villain even though it was unlikely to actually happen this proved quite tense. Overall a pretty good film it may be a bit crackly but the story is quite fresh.".

While she may be remembered most for her several great song and dance films with Fred Astaire Ginger was an established actress well before that time. And she had some excellent dramatic comedy and suspense roles throughout her long career of entertaining audiences. She won an Oscar as best actress for her title role in the 1940 film Kitty Foyle.A Shriek in the Night is one of Rogers' early roles. Although it's billed as a comedy first this film is best described as a mystery thriller. There's plenty of crime and a little lightheartedness but the best stuff of this movie is the mystery. It's a good whodunit. The cast all are good but none are exceptional. The sets are good and the plot is very interesting. Nevertheless the B level of this film is evident in the rest of the production. The direction screenplay and editing are weak. Still there's intrigue enough to keep one guessing until the very end. So it's a satisfying mysterythriller that should please most audiences.I thought I had submitted these comments in March 2014 but apparently I failed to hit the SUBMIT button.".

Actually I'm puzzled as to what Ginger Rogers was doing here at this point in her career. Some sort of loanout from her new studio RKO? Was RKO responsible for the realistic outdoor shooting and the occasionally witty banter in the script? There must be some story here but I've never come across it.In any event a handsome young couple wisecracking their way through a murder mystery was a staple of thirties' filmmaking and stayed that way for at least for another fifty years the TV series Moonlighting would be the latest 'New Hot Thing' of its time which was at least 50 years after SHRIEK. This was a pretty early example of the genre and not the worst that it would produce by a long shot. Not exactly a sequel to THE THIRTEENTH GUEST though it also was about a murder and featured the same two leads SHRIEK is much more in the spirit of THE THIN MAN as our pair of rival reporters Rogers and Talbot banter their way through a murder investigation What's romantic about a speakeasy? Man! Don't be vulgar that is heavier on the comedy than it is on the mystery it's not a good sign when you have to spend two minutes at the end of your picture explaining what the plot had been about.Lyle Talbot had sort of reached his level as the star of movies like this Ginger Rogers of course was about to reach her level as the star of movies like TOP HAT. They raise material which otherwise was potentially watchable to material that iswell watchable. One reviewer suggested that it would have been better had Ginger gone off to solve the mystery with Detective Purnell Pratt as they had better chemistry than she had with Talbot and I believe that I agree with that idea.

What follows is a series of murders in and around an apartment building some of which is rather dark for what we think of as a 1930's mystery but then again its precode so some of whats said is more than a little blue.I can't believe this is the follow up to The 13th Guest since Ginger is so stiff and much of her performance consists of smoking. She smokes a lot here and its almost pathological. Yes she has a great deal of screen time and is the lead but the role isn't well written.Yes the dialog is snappy and the mystery interesting but at times it feels too long even at 66 minutes. Its the fact that at times the events double back on themselves I think because the budget was low.Does that mean its a bad movie no its not. Its quite good but The 13th Guest is better. If you can get them as a pair or get this with something else then by all means do so but don't get this on its own unless you get it for about five bucks or the cost of a rental.".

Yes she has a great deal of screen time and is the lead but the role isn't well written.Yes the dialog is snappy and the mystery interesting but at times it feels too long even at 66 minutes. Its the fact that at times the events double back on themselves I think because the budget was low.Does that mean its a bad movie no its not. Its quite good but The 13th Guest is better. If you can get them as a pair or get this with something else then by all means do so but don't get this on its own unless you get it for about five bucks or the cost of a rental.";

There is a lot of byplay lots of telephone calls quite a bit of going in and out of apartments some misdirected gas used as a weapon a weird janitor and on and on. It's actually a pretty decent story. When you have people of star quality you can get away with a low budget. My favorite character is a milquetoast detective who becomes very important when the chips are down. He is treated with disdain by his boss throughout the movie. There are of course the mandatory sexist remarks. A woman's place is in the home and all that. But it was a different time. See it sometime it's not too bad.".

The best was when the black maid didn't was sitting in a convertible outside the morgue and she asked why they were there. The cop said you're here to identify a dead person. She said no she won't go. The copy says it's either that or I'll put you in jail. She says I'd rather be in jail with live people than in the morgue with dead people. Then the boss cop comes in and says we have someone else to identify the dead person and that you can go. The maid hightails it out of the car and runs back up the street and almost gets run over by another car. This scene alone is worth watching this film. There are tons of intelligent dialogue here. The terror element comes from the Janitor as the killer. We see him bring Ginger Rodgers to the basement to the basement and to put her in the furnace. This is all great stuff. The movie is slow in parts. And as mentioned the mystery is a bit convoluted with different murders. But it all works well. It's entertaining. It is a comedy thriller mystery. It works. They could have made this full on thriller mystery without the convoluted story by just concentrating on a psycho janitor. That could have worked too. But this is what we have.".

It's well respected philanthropist Paul Lorenz who's out to educated the youth of America about the dangers of both sex out of marriage as well as unprotected sex. He may have succeeded in getting the word out but his son Tom didn't hear it.

The film does have valid points about how you shouldn't have a kid if you have syphilis. And you shouldn't have sex if you have it either. However the whole idea of someone with this disease being forbid by their doctor to get married seemed a little strange to me. Plus the main woman was in cloud nine the whole as if the whole world was either completely wonderful or completely horrible. I also thought the point about the quacks was interesting because it's harder today to figure out if a doctor is a quack since we have such a high rate of suing for malpractice. A doctor today might push some unnecessary pills on you so that she will get some money from the drug company but they would never go so far as to guarantee you are cured of syphilis and can now freely have sex with people when you actually weren't cured at all. That's just bogus. I'm glad that doesn't happen anymore.Watch this movie to see how drastically times have changed but also to educate yourself about this disease.

In addition to the overly melodramatic and silly story the movie also passes along a lot of information to the audiencesome of which is wrong I taught sex ed and could tell. These portions of the films were very dry and preachy at best. Most likely it just helped to put the audience to sleep.Overall instead of being a movie to frankly talk about STDs it was cheap and in many ways exploitational. Because of its rotten production values this film was the inspiration for the take off of sexploitation films done at the end of AMAZON WOMEN ON THE MOON starring Carrie Fisher and Paul Bartell.

Yes those urges are natural but only a person with low selfesteem would want to engage in intercourse before marriage. And anyway you might catch a deadly disease to boot.

I love the assumption abstinenceonly supporters make that when you're married you won't catch STDs. OKEY DOKEY. Sex Madness is worth watching especially if you are coming to terms with why the whiteAmericanmiddleclass vision of the world has always lacked any real intelligence. Its mission has always been white people procreating. The film's message need not be smartly portrayed rather it should be portrayed repeatedly and simply for mass consumption.I do get a kick out of the comments left for these films by IMDBers who take these genre films seriously and are shocked after watching them. Of course they are wrong. They are tools of oppression.Finally it's worth the purchase of the DVD for the two US Navy hygiene films that come as bonus features on an Alpha Films copy. Cocaine Fiends is my favorite of the bunch.".

Sex Madness is worth watching especially if you are coming to terms with why the whiteAmericanmiddleclass vision of the world has always lacked any real intelligence. Its mission has always been white people procreating. The film's message need not be smartly portrayed rather it should be portrayed repeatedly and simply for mass consumption.I do get a kick out of the comments left for these films by IMDBers who take these genre films seriously and are shocked after watching them. Of course they are wrong. They are tools of oppression.Finally it's worth the purchase of the DVD for the two US Navy hygiene films that come as bonus features on an Alpha Films copy. Cocaine Fiends is my favorite of the bunch.";

These movies should not really be labeled Cult Classics but rather Goofy Old Propaganda Films That Are Mostly Terrible and Which You Don't Really Need to See  Knowing That They Existed Is More Than Enough. I suppose that'd be a bit wordy though. And it really doesn't help that the quality is abysmal. Obviously nobody cared enough to preserve these films but I really wonder what Reefer Madness would look like in high definition. Sex Madness is a pure propaganda film which wants to warn its audience about the dangers of syphilis and other social diseases. You have to wonder if anyone in 1938 actually plunked down a nickel to see films like this. The film basically consists of a doctor telling a skank that she has contracted syphilis and what that entails. The authority figures of the film declare that people need to be more honest about sex but what their honesty amounts to is shouting keep your damn legs shut or you'll get sores! This is what they look like. Aren't they gross? Its second piece of advice is probably more helpful people with syphilis or other VDs need to see a real doctor and not some quack. I'll bet that in their embarrassment the syphilitic would often turn to more discreet illegal doctors there's probably some implied abortion there too. The film is of course a total bore and it looks like crud.".

	schema:reviewBody "I once had a conversation with a female friend where the conversation got around to sexual morality namely society's view on promiscuity  Why do people despise promiscuity ?  I said  It's because the same people are jealous that they never got the opportunity to be promiscuous . It's entirely sour grapes  I wasn't bragging just stating the truth  my own life has been blighted by long periods of despair ridden loneliness so much so that she asked about the celibacy destiny had forced upon me  Is it true what they say about celibacy ?   Is what true ?   That you're able to concentrate on other things better ?  This question threw me since I'd never heard that no sex equals an increase in the powers of concentration  No . In fact I spend so much time thinking I could do with a good hard F it's difficult to concentrate on anything else  My friend was brought as a Catholic so I'm guessing that this obscure myth about celibacy is one of many put forward by people in the Catholic church pursuing an ecclesiastical agenda SEX MADNESS is propaganda of the worst sort . It's not putting forward an agenda against syphilis like it claims  it's putting forward an agenda that we should all be practicing Christians Take the opening scene where a character states  The police are too lenient with these vicious exhibitions of sex . I see that evangelist Fred Phelps and his committee are doing wonderful work . He'll clean up up this filth and give our youngsters a wonderful life  Actually the above is a misquote . I simply changed a name but you do realise how ridiculous it sounds . And it becomes more ridiculous in the space of a couple of minutes when some blonde secretary takes a female colleague to a show featuring dancers . Amazingly this was during the era where the Hays Code was just brought in to the studio system since the blonde is an obvious predatory lesbian and if you go to a dance show with a lesbian as sure as night follows day you'll become a lesbian yourself . . I'm not really sure if this is based on any scientific fact . Nor do I think that dancers and prostitutes have the same career path because this film insinuates that being a dancer and being a whore are the exact same thing Well let's say for the sake of argument women will turn in to rabid lesbians if they see a dance troupe and dancers are whores  so what ? At least they're all consenting adults exploring their own sexuality . Not so for one patron at the theater who after seeing the decidedly unerotic dance show becomes so flustered that he goes out and rapes a young child going home with some shopping . Let me get this right  you watch a girlie show and it'll turn you in to a paedo ? I must have missed this Earth shattering scientific revelation . Remind me what medical thesis it appeared in again ? And what has any of this got to do with the scourge of syphilis ? The film gives totally confused message . If you have loose morals then you will catch  a social disease  in general and syphilis in particular . Strange that the use of condoms is never brought up but both God and morality both are . . You can see a blatantly unhidden agenda being pushed forward by the makers of SEX MADNESS  but considering the Christians churches in general and the Catholic church in particular have shot themselves in the foot where sexual morality is concerned I'll form my own world view on what's right and wrong where sex is concerned . I would never think less of someone if they'd been promiscuous . I'd never think less of someone who'd spent a long period of time voluntarily celibate because morality is entirely subjective".

	schema:reviewBody "It's an old scratchy movie about the danger of syphilis. It seems proud of itself for dealing with the disease although the treatment so to speak was better done in Warner's Dr. Ehrlich's Magic Bullet. It's preceded by one of those announcements trumpeting the seriousness of the subject. You've probably seen them before. If it's not syphilis it's some other lethal threat. It's the mad empire of Japan the jackbooted threat of Naziism the crepuscular shenanigans of organized crime the lure of dope the tentacular charm of Margaret Groin the girl who refused my invitation to the senior prom because I insisted on wearing Bermuda shorts.The acting is terrible. Let's get that out of the way first. There has been better acting in a high school production of Our Town in Scotch Plains New Jersey. Storywise it seems that the new District Attorney or somebody is raiding girlie shows. His last drag netted eleven girls who were seen removing their hampering garments on the public stage. I found myself wondering about the agents of social control who were assigned the loathsome task of watching the shows until the crime was committed. I kept thinking of Anthony Comstock the postal inspector of the 1800s and sworn foe of Margaret Sanger who couldn't tear himself away from the perusal of salacious material. He even blocked some medical texts from reaching medical schools. A lifetime devoted to reading dirty stuff so he could condemn it a job to kill for.This movie runs along similar lines rather like Cecile B. DeMille's showing us Claudette Colbert taking a nude bath in ass's milk. Terrible stuff. We see a burlesque show with two dozen girls dressed in bathing suits too modest for today's tastes. In the audience a mustachioed young man is trying to talk his girl friend into spending the night with him. You can tell your mother you're staying with friends. Nearby a sinister and horny lesbian in dark clothes is seducing an innocent young virgin in white clothes. There are cuts to the maniacal grins of drooling males in the audience. Afterwards the boys take some of the girls to a house party where everyone flirts and boozes it up.Around this point it occurred to me that some viewers might be thinking What's WRONG with these people? It occurred to me that maybe there was nothing at all wrong with them that they were just doing what the situation demanded that the problem if there was one was systemic. As individuals we tend to imitate the behavior of those around us. That's called culture and it's why we're doing this in English instead of Urdu and it's why none of us will wear a toga to work tomorrow. It's why there is no such thing as The Society For the Advancement of Ugly People. There are of course subcultures into which we may find ourselves swept up because of constitutional quirks as much as culture. There IS a Flat Earth Society and there are presidential elections.You want a movie about syphilis? Watch Dr. Ehrlich's Magic Bullet. You want a movie with lots of sex? Just go to a movie.".

I liked how they combined the old footage with the new and it was great to see william H again as andre toulon. The recreation of the bodaga bay inn was good I couldn't tell the difference from the original. I liked the humor the family scenes and the emotion of the lead character. All he wanted was to serve his country and like all good stories he got his chance. It was great to see the puppets in action again doing what they do best. The new puppet was also entertaining. The special features were also good. Thank you Fullmoon Entertainment for this installment to the puppet master series.".

	schema:reviewBody "The tenth ! entry in Charles Band's long running series is really rough and cheap stuff but actually better than the last few sequels which says a lot. The film opens by incorporating the original's 1939 prologue where the puppet master Andre Toulon William Hickey kills himself at the Bodega Bay Inn. New footage has limping Danny Coogan Levi Fiehler stumbling onto the scene just as the two Nazis who ransacked Toulon's room are leaving. Danny was apparently friends with Toulon and knows where the hidden puppets are and takes them. He returns home to Chinatown in LA and is upset that he can't join the war effort to take on the Japs and Krauts heh heh...more on that in a bit. But he soon finds he can do his part stateside when he discovers one of the Nazis working undercover at a local munitions factory.This series has been running for 20 years and I think it pretty much sum up producer Band's career during that time period. The first three are decent little movies with the proper exploitation elements. Then Band opted to do them on the cheap and each successive film got more and more cutrate until you finally had the obligatory clip show with 15 new minutes of footage entry PUPPET MASTER LEGACY. This one tries to bring it back to the level of the first three by continuing the storyline set up in part III's Germany set sequel. Unfortunately Band is still cutting corners and has found some new money mark in China where the film was shot for pennies er yuan. You get some of the worst sets you'll ever seen where the camera actually exposes the tops on several occasions and you can see the same extras over and over in the exterior shots. Director David DeCoteau did three previous entries and really seems to be trying but the film is just sort of there. He fails to bring the exploitation factor as there is no stop motion actually there hasn't been since part V I believe no nudity and very little gore. He did find some good leads with the exception of the girl who plays the Japanese spy who turns in one of the worst performances I've seen in a while.And now for the biggie! I'll admit I admire them taking it back to 1939 and using that as a launching point but  MY GOD  do you really have a lead character spend the whole film talking about how he wishes he could enlist into the service to go overseas and fight the Japs and Krauts IN 1939!?! There are constant references to America kids fighting overseas. HISTORY LESSON FAIL! Even worse later a character makes a reference to Pearl Harbor! I'm amazed that no one who read the script said Uh we might have a continuity problem here. The funny thing is there is a making of video on the disc and DeCoteau says the film is set in 1941 even though characters reference Danny's work at the hotel and discovery of Toulon's body being a few weeks ago.".

	schema:reviewBody "Director David Decoteau's Puppet Master III Curse of the Puppet Master and Retro Puppet Master 2010 directtoDVD prequel Puppet Master Axis of Evil is quite a surprise. It's not a good movie by any means don't get me wrong. It's really bad at times but it's also highly enjoyable as a cheap horror film and has some good fun moments and it is a definite step up after the abysmal cheap clipshow of a film the prior entry Legacy was.The films starts off with an extremely welldone retcon of the original Puppet Master film's prologue almost seamlessly mixing old archival footage and new footage Danny Coogan Levi Fletcher a young man whom wants to fight in World War II but can't due to a bad limp stumbles into the room of the puppet master Andre Toulon William Hickey in archival footage just moments after he killed himself. Danny had been shown Toulon's puppets before and is able to recover them from their hiding place in the wall vowing to take care of them and keep them safe from the Nazis Max and Klaus who had been sent to retrieve them for Hitler. Max and Klaus are played by Tom Sandoval and Aaron Riber Danny returns home to Los Angeles ChinaTown district where his mother and older brother about to depart for the war live and where his girlfriend Beth Jenna Gallaher works. However Max and Klaus track down Danny's address and begrudgingly unite with a Japanese spy and her associates to retrieve the puppets for the Axis and to blow up the factory where Beth works which may or may not be home to a new secret Allied weapon.I will give credit where credit is due there are a lot of good fun moments in this directtoDVD film. Some of the retcon work in the beginning is highly impressive it matches perfectly except for slight differences in the lighting the characters though underdeveloped and poorly acted are likable and there's even some good unintentional social commentary. Including a good jab at American ignorance in that our Japanese villainess is able to hide out in plain sight in ChinaTown because Americans are too ignorant to be able to tell Chinese and Japanese apart. It's also just good to see the puppets in action again as a fan of earlier installments in the series.However when this film falls apart and times it really falls apart. For one it's 81 minutes long but nearly ten minutes of that footage includes the opening and closing credits and a large portion of archival footage from the original film so the film is really only about 71 minutes of new footage. And it just isn't enough time to develop the sortof story the director and writer are going for. You can tell that a lot of scenes must have been cut for budget and time reasons too much is implied through dialog when it should have been shown on screen and the film takes place in the same few locations from scene to scene and it hurts the film. What makes this even stranger is that it's not a fast film per say it's actually a slowermoving film editingwise which makes it seem even shorter than it already is. It really could have benefited from another 10 minutes of footage.Two this is not really a wellmade movie. It feels far too lowbudget. The puppet effects are all very bland and basic and look arguably worse than they did in earlier films. The production design is very cheap. The acting isn't the greatest the actors are charming but just can't act. It just reeks of low budget directtoDVD. Those complains being said this is still a watchable film. It's one of the weaker entries in the series to be honest the series has gotten a lot worse since the third film but is still mildly entertaining. I'd give it a just underaverage 4 out of 10. If you're a fan of the earlier films pick up the box set of all nine official entries and give this one a watch. It's worth seeing for the fans.".

The plot follows a young man fighting the Nazis in a dark urban setting losing his loved ones and then getting revenge. Pt 3 is a good film but remaking it twice is twice too many. Worst of all is that the puppets have less to do with the story and they look shabbier in each film. Lets face it the puppets are the stars.Its gorgeously shot directed as well as a fast and cheap horror film can be and you have to admire the craftsmanship of a movie filmed for peanuts but its not entertaining or original enough. This is the 1st of a trilogy and so you don't receive any closure but you do feel a rage at the cynical moneygrubbing quality of Full Moon's lesser films.

	schema:headline " Puppet Master Axis of Evil  A flawed installment a setup for something more...";
	schema:reviewBody "Let me start off by saying that I find the Puppet Master mythology to be one of the more intriguing of the horror genre. The idea behind it the concept and the lore supporting it is far more interesting to me than the concepts of other betterknown horror films such as Halloween or especially Friday the 13th. There is a mysticism an aura of magic around watching the puppets do what they dothat keeps me interested in them even while other elements of the films sink into the abyss of Zrated schlock. Sadly the charm of these puppets is not enough to support their films especially with the absence of the late David Allen's stellar special effects. Primarily it seems like the weakest element to these films is the writing which generally seems rote or amateur. If it's not the writing then it's the acting or the production values. In one way or another something seems off. Axis of Evil is no exception. A direct sequel to the prologue of the 1989 Puppet Master Axis of Evil branches off into a sort of side story about a young man's discovery of the puppets of Andre Toulona German puppeteer who killed himself to protect his reanimation serum from the clutches of the Nazis. It then tells the story of his struggle against two Nazi assassins named Max and Klaus who are trying to secure the serum and the puppets for Hitler. Also involved is a Japanese saboteur named Ozu who has her own plans for the elixir which rhyme with give serum to the emperor! Much reward! Yay!. The story while fairly mundane does have a bit of weight behind it. However while the story had the potential to make Axis of Evil more than what it is the execution floored this possibility. The puppet effects created by Gage Munster aren't anywhere near as strong or graceful as they ought to be considering the focus of the film is on the puppets. I understand that these aren't supposed to be Jurassic Parkquality special effects they're living puppets after all. But there's still something wrong about their inorganic clumsiness. It veers out of context and into being cheap. Out of special effects the production design is actually fairly strong with visible effort put into the sets and costumes. The human element of the film the acting isn't terribly shabby in itself the trouble in this respect comes from the casting. All of the characters who feel off in the film aren't acted out poorly they're just acted out by people who are too young for the roles. The best example of this can be found in the antagonists. The actors who play the Nazis cannot be far beyond their 20s while they should be in their late30s or 40s for the roles of Max and Klaus. Their youth makes them both hard to take very seriously. Also Jenna Gallaher's character seems to demand dame while she gives it valley girl. On another note the revised score by Richard Band is refreshing. I really wish I could say better of Axis of Evil I really do. I want to like the new Puppet Master films like I liked the first wave. But ever since Full Moon Features left Paramount the studio has been stuck in a rut that is still evident in Axis of Evil. So is not to say that the film is bad it is improved over the past few installments. I just wish it was better. Axis of Evil does end with a cliffhanger a setup for the inevitable and imminent sequel Axis Rising. Here's hoping it's an improvement over this film. Here's hoping it's the 21stcentury sequel that the puppets the fans and the license deserve.".

	onyx:emotionText "Let me start off by saying that I find the Puppet Master mythology to be one of the more intriguing of the horror genre. The idea behind it the concept and the lore supporting it is far more interesting to me than the concepts of other betterknown horror films such as Halloween or especially Friday the 13th. There is a mysticism an aura of magic around watching the puppets do what they dothat keeps me interested in them even while other elements of the films sink into the abyss of Zrated schlock. Sadly the charm of these puppets is not enough to support their films especially with the absence of the late David Allen's stellar special effects. Primarily it seems like the weakest element to these films is the writing which generally seems rote or amateur. If it's not the writing then it's the acting or the production values. In one way or another something seems off. Axis of Evil is no exception. A direct sequel to the prologue of the 1989 Puppet Master Axis of Evil branches off into a sort of side story about a young man's discovery of the puppets of Andre Toulona German puppeteer who killed himself to protect his reanimation serum from the clutches of the Nazis. It then tells the story of his struggle against two Nazi assassins named Max and Klaus who are trying to secure the serum and the puppets for Hitler. Also involved is a Japanese saboteur named Ozu who has her own plans for the elixir which rhyme with give serum to the emperor! Much reward! Yay!. The story while fairly mundane does have a bit of weight behind it. However while the story had the potential to make Axis of Evil more than what it is the execution floored this possibility. The puppet effects created by Gage Munster aren't anywhere near as strong or graceful as they ought to be considering the focus of the film is on the puppets. I understand that these aren't supposed to be Jurassic Parkquality special effects they're living puppets after all. But there's still something wrong about their inorganic clumsiness. It veers out of context and into being cheap. Out of special effects the production design is actually fairly strong with visible effort put into the sets and costumes. The human element of the film the acting isn't terribly shabby in itself the trouble in this respect comes from the casting. All of the characters who feel off in the film aren't acted out poorly they're just acted out by people who are too young for the roles. The best example of this can be found in the antagonists. The actors who play the Nazis cannot be far beyond their 20s while they should be in their late30s or 40s for the roles of Max and Klaus. Their youth makes them both hard to take very seriously. Also Jenna Gallaher's character seems to demand dame while she gives it valley girl. On another note the revised score by Richard Band is refreshing.

	schema:reviewBody "The Puppet Master series has been running strong since 1989. Throughout the series it has taken the storyline in all sorts of directions creating a chronological history that can be confusing. While Puppet Master Axis of Evil is the ninth official film in the series it actually is third in chronological order for the series itself. With varying stories and evolution to the characters can Axis of Evil bring something new to the story and continue to evolve these beloved horror icons and a deliver another stepping stone for the future of these characters? Puppet Master Axis Rising follows Toulon as he takes shelter at the Bodega Bay Inn in California. When two soldiers are sent to kill him for his secrets he hides the puppets away and commits suicide in hopes to have his secrets die with him. When an employee discovers his body and the puppets he begins to take care of them eventually discovering their secrets as well as that of the Gestapo's plans to bomb the United States. With the help of puppets he sets out to stop them before they can set their plan in motion. Featuring Blade Pinhead Jester Tunneler Six Shooter's arms Shredder Khan Gengie and Ninja this latest entry expands on the opening sequence in the original Puppet Master even using the same footage. There have been some various inconstancies throughout the series but still always managed to bring it all together fairly well. This connection to the original seems to bring it back on track as though Band is trying to reconnect all those missing pieces in a more cohesive manner. This one takes a little bit longer to get to the fun but the clear attempt to tell more of an origin story makes it work. This is an entertaining entry into the series while the acting is not all that great. Over the years the acting side of it has seemed to go down a bit but is overshadowed by the sheer fun of the puppets in action.If you're a true horror fan or just love anything Full Moon puts out this is a must have version of Puppet Master Axis of Evil. In addition to the film it includes additional features The Making of Evil 13 Vidcasts from China No Strings Attached the original making of from the first Puppet Master and includes the trailers from all 9 original Puppet Master films.

	schema:reviewBody "You don't pick up a Puppet Master movie expecting a masterpiece or some sort of groundbreaking classic. All the same I'd been looking forward to this one for a while. The WWII setting had worked wonderfully in Puppet Master 3 in my opinion the best installment of the series and I was hoping lightning would strike twice with 'Axis Of Evil'.The first half is flawed but watchable. Some dodgy acting yes but with these kind of movies that's almost part of the fun. The lighting is nice and moody it's pretty well shot even if the dialog resembles some sort of uncomfortable 40's racist propaganda movie. To the historical inaccuracy that others have mentioned  yes it's pretty jawdropping that such an obvious mistake slipped in to the final cut. We're not talking about Arthurian legend or Biblical times  this is recent history and anyone who made it through high school should be well aware of the time line of events.It makes me wonder what the scenario is that caused this glaring error. Did no one involved with the film know anything about WWII? Were they aware of the mistake and just didn't think it mattered? Did they think Puppet Master fans were too stupid to notice? Whatever...it certainly doesn't show the production in a favorable light.And yet for all these errors I'd be willing to overlook them if there was some decent action with Blade  co. It is the fan's love for those little buggers that has sustained this franchise and they deserve treating with respect.Well unfortunately the very brief moments in which the puppets do appear are the worst parts of the movie. The movement the execution...it's all just embarrassingly bad. Literally. When Blade 'runs' across the screen I guarantee you will actually squirm with embarrassment. I sure did. It simply looks terrible  like a home movie a kid made of his toys moving around his bedroom. It completely kills what little tension has been built up over the preceding 80 minutes.I'm aware that this movie was probably made on a shoestring. Nevertheless job 1 when making any Puppet Master movie should be making the puppets look and move great and giving them some exciting stuff to do. Hire the cheapest actors you can find film the movie outside your local mall no one cares just make the damn puppets look good.Well they didn't and they don't. Axis of Evil is a very poor movie and moreover it's very poor Puppet Master.".

The lighting is nice and moody it's pretty well shot even if the dialog resembles some sort of uncomfortable 40's racist propaganda movie. To the historical inaccuracy that others have mentioned  yes it's pretty jawdropping that such an obvious mistake slipped in to the final cut. We're not talking about Arthurian legend or Biblical times  this is recent history and anyone who made it through high school should be well aware of the time line of events.It makes me wonder what the scenario is that caused this glaring error. Did no one involved with the film know anything about WWII? Were they aware of the mistake and just didn't think it mattered? Did they think Puppet Master fans were too stupid to notice? Whatever...it certainly doesn't show the production in a favorable light.And yet for all these errors I'd be willing to overlook them if there was some decent action with Blade  co. It is the fan's love for those little buggers that has sustained this franchise and they deserve treating with respect.Well unfortunately the very brief moments in which the puppets do appear are the worst parts of the movie. The movement the execution...it's all just embarrassingly bad. Literally. When Blade 'runs' across the screen I guarantee you will actually squirm with embarrassment. I sure did. It simply looks terrible  like a home movie a kid made of his toys moving around his bedroom. It completely kills what little tension has been built up over the preceding 80 minutes.I'm aware that this movie was probably made on a shoestring. Nevertheless job 1 when making any Puppet Master movie should be making the puppets look and move great and giving them some exciting stuff to do. Hire the cheapest actors you can find film the movie outside your local mall no one cares just make the damn puppets look good.Well they didn't and they don't. Axis of Evil is a very poor movie and moreover it's very poor Puppet Master.";

They needed to use a dead actor so the footage had to be old and it ties the story together more fluidly.What is up with the young Nazis? Is it just me or does the idea of two young under 30 Nazis being the only force to infiltrate the American war effort seem silly? Jenna Gallagher was decent as Beth and fairly attractive. The real mystery is why Full Moon regular Robin Sydney did not get the part or any part in this movie. She never fails to entertain and it would be nice to see her in this series.But the real issue with this film is the anachronisms the movie takes place in 1939 but the U.S. did not enter WWII until the Japanese attack on December 7th 1941. So why are we fighting in France and Japan already? The concentration camp Auschwitz is mentioned but the camp was build two years after the events depicted in this movie. The female Japanese agent mentions Kamikaze attacks but no Kamikaze units existed until 1944.The USA flag hanging on the wall in Danny's room has 50 stars on it but the USA only had 48 states so there would only have been 48 stars on it 1 for each state. It was not until August 21 1959 when Hawaii became the 50th state that 50 stars appeared on the flag.This film needs work!".

The first two sequels were certainly okay they both had something to add to the original story. After that Puppet Master 4 and 5 were shot backto back awful cheap PG13 movies which really sucked in a big way. That can also be said for the sixth and seventh one. Puppet Master The Legacy was more of a homage a bestof which included mostly scenes from the earlier ones. It was the eight one if I'm not mistaking. No idea why they had to make another one part 9 or 10 already I lost track. Directed by David DeCoteau. He also directed the third one which was actually a pretty good sequel. But that was along time ago. He's responsible for cheap garbage like the Brotherhood movies. He really should be locked up for crap like that. Puppet Master Axis of Evil is not really that better. The best moments are in the beginning when scenes from the original one are included with William Hickley as Andre Toulon. That is also the big flaw because the quality of those scenes and the new movie couldn't be more different. The story sucks the cast is pretty awful and painfully to watch. The characters make no sense at all. The puppets are given a very limited screen time. The best scenes are.. again the clips from the original movie. No real horror or gore here no tension or thrills. Just boring from start to finish. I hope there will never be another Puppet Master sequel and that DeCoteau will never make another movie. This franchise is just like the Hellraiser franchise it really is a trilogy the rest is just totally awful...".

The film follows what happens immediately thereafter with a young man Danny finding the puppets and taking them under his wing. There's nothing great about the dialogue or acting or story for that matter but it was an interesting enough continuation of the story. We have two Nazi spies posing as Americans but they don't even have German accents so they're not credible Germans either who work together with a Japanese woman who is also after the serum that brings the puppets to life. There's a lot of back stabbing and double crossing here but there are just way too many conveniences and plot flaws. Also why did Danny trust the puppets so easily into helping him and how did he know they would or even could as he knew nothing about them? And why did the puppets trust him in return?

	onyx:emotionText "Back to 1939 we go with starts off with footage from the beginning of 1989's original film where Andre Toulin committed suicide. The film follows what happens immediately thereafter with a young man Danny finding the puppets and taking them under his wing. There's nothing great about the dialogue or acting or story for that matter but it was an interesting enough continuation of the story. We have two Nazi spies posing as Americans but they don't even have German accents so they're not credible Germans either who work together with a Japanese woman who is also after the serum that brings the puppets to life. There's a lot of back stabbing and double crossing here but there are just way too many conveniences and plot flaws. Also why did Danny trust the puppets so easily into helping him and how did he know they would or even could as he knew nothing about them? And why did the puppets trust him in return? The puppets look rather lifeless.";

So the problem is the effects which are really terrible. No stop motion no detailed puppetry no interesting visuals and the Ninja's puppet design is horrible. He pretty much looks like painted cardboard with a black robe. And there are only a few scenes were you see the puppets in the same frame as the bad guys. And the close ups of the pinhead look really bad. I wish they could have done the special effects better it would improve the movie so much. Without them the film becomes very boring. So I don't recommend it.".

The story takes place immediately after as a young wood carver named Danny Coogan tries to stop the Nazi's from stealing Toulon's elixir of life. The second aspect I enjoyed is that the Nazi's are yet again the main antagonist during the World War II era. That being said the movie is tough to watch at times being awful and a little dull. There is some very wood acting in this movie too almost like the puppets themselves. Check the movie out if you're a diehard fan of the franchise and to view the new ninja puppet. There are some cool scenes and I like the concept but overall its low score is received for bad writing directing and acting.".

A lesser filmmaker than Atom Egoyan would've jumped at the chance to shock the audience with the freak accident that robs the town of Sam Dent of nearly all their children by telling the story in a linear fashion. Not Egoyan. The story is fragmented thus enhancing the true point This is not about the overwhelming power of loss it is about the overwhelming power of survivor's guilt nicely represented in Browning's poem The Pied Piper Of Hamelin which is referred to in the movie. It's all about people who grieve not only for the ones they've lost but also for themselves how empty their lives have become because of their tragedies. In focussing on that point the film refrains from manipulative sentiment which so many others don't and presents true and unintrusive emotion that in the end despite all the terror shines a light of hope for the sweet hereafter is not only the peaceful afterlife it's also the peaceful future the continuation of life...The performances speak for themselves. Ian Holm and Sarah Polley shine in particular through nicely subdued and subtle acting. Polley also excels as a fantastic singersongwriter. The songs in the movie were written and performed all by herself.Egoyan's direction is simply masterful in its beauty elegance and evocation.One of the best films of the 1990s.10 out of 10.".

There's also a great scene in the movie between the lawyer and the garage mechanic who has lost his two children that shows that the theme is much broader than the literal storyI'm telling you this because... we've all lost our children Mr. Ansel. They're dead to us. They kill each other in the streets. They wander comatose in shopping malls. They're paralyzed in front of televisions. Something terrible has happened that's taken our children away. It's too late. They're gone.This movie isn't for everyone. It's a serious layered piece with a lot of melancholy.  The kind of fare that film critics can love but Academy voters will avoid. But what it strives to accomplish is done very well.

The Sweet Hereafter is one of them it is an engrossing film that doesn't rely on emotional manipulation to effect it's viewer it tells a tale like it is and in the end that is exactly what makes it so good. The film studies a small Canadian town in the face of tragedy and  carefully layers a series of intertwining stories involving a handful of locals who have all been impacted by the occurence. Every character seems to have a normal life at first but as the film progresses it becomes clear that they do not. They are emotionally void people who all harbour secrets and lies and as much as they want to believe what they're doing is right deep down they know it's not. Intense emotions of guilt and grief run through them but for unusual reasons. The Sweet Hereafter examines the things that surface after the wake of a tragedy after the eminent shock and sorrow how people's lives become so deteriorated and barren. The film skillfully uses different perspectives places and time to explore the span of everything involved asking why some things in the universe are out of our control and if they happen for a reason. I was impressed with the film's meticulous structure every frame is measured delicately to maximise it's power and it works 100 percent of the time. From stark to striking it's visuals work just as well as it's intellect. Ok so Russell Bank's novel is a bit clearer but Atom Egoyan's take on it is just as effective if not more. Another thing that makes this film shine are it's performances Sarah Polley and Ian Holme are both superb both exude with a gentle sadness that genuinely convinces. In all The Sweet Hereafter is a film that needs to be seen it is a beautifully realised and haunting film that's virtually impossible to forget.".

The scene where Bruce Greenwood's character witnesses the school bus carrying his two children and all the hopes and dreams of a small town skid nonchalantly off an icy road and onto a frozen body of water that can't possibly hold the vehicle's weight is among the most chilling heartwrenching and gutdropping scenes ever put on film.

But that summary really tells nothing because this haunting tale is not about a grasping lawyer or greedy victims but about how nothing is ever as it seems on the surface.Director Atom Egoyan does a remarkable job with the narrative.  Though at times the movie is difficult to follow because of some sequences which it is not immediately clear are flashbacks it's worth sticking with it.  The story works precisely because the chronology is chopped up to reveal the secrets each character including the lawyer keeps hidden until the tragedy finally rips open the lives of everyone it touches.Repeat viewings are definitely in order if only because of the multiple interwoven layers and images which are not always apparent on first viewing and to ponder the interplay among the three strands of narrative in the movie.

	schema:reviewBody "How much money is your child worth? Is that a question you could ever fathom yourself asking? Atom Egoyan's The Sweet Hereafter broaches the subject with devastating results showing the many ways in which one could lose their offspring and the pain and suffering it causes. But can that pain be tempered by a monetary settlement or a name being punished with a slap on the wrist? No of course not. Vengeance will only feed your lust for blood it will only make you go deeper and deeper into a descent towards hell. There comes a time where you must look at your life and feel rewarded for the time you've had and be able to move on no matter how slow and painful that transition may be. This film is pretty much perfect on all countsstory acting pacing directing you name it. As it went on I couldn't help but think of David Gordon Green's film Snow Angels and the comparisons of loss and renewal as thematic backbones. Interestingly enough both of these films were my first foray into the two director's oeuvres both possibly their most sorrowful and heartfelt making me want to visit the rest of their works. What the similarity also does over ten years later is prove Egoyan himself correct. My screening of The Sweet Hereafter was followed by a QA with editor Susan Shipman who spoke of how just that morning Atom told her upon revisiting the film that I think it holds up. He couldn't be more right its relevance has stood the test of time.At its core the film is about the loss of innocence the disintegration of the parentchild dynamic. Values had started to fall by the wayside as people began living their lives with a drive for money and power allowing drugs and greed to destroy any semblance of compassion and morals. We've all lost our children says Ian Holm's Mitchell Stevens a cutthroat lawyer looking for blood by suing a manufacturing firm for a horrible accident that really had no one's fault to blame but also a loving father who lost his hope and dream of the idyllic family. Each and every character has lost someone dear to them whether that be the parents of the children who perished in the school bus accident at the center of it all the driver Dolores wonderfully played by Gabrielle Rose upon losing all the children of her town and surviving or Holm with an estranged child who has been in and out of drug abuse clinics for over a decade possibly dying or just scamming him for money any chance she gets. Love is shown in all its many forms from a father's incestuous relationship with his daughter to the unencumbered joy in an adopted Indigenous son to the worrisome mother for her learning disabled child to the father who knows he enables his daughter's drug habit but can't stop because there may be one time when she actually isn't lying to him. Love is a gamble that you take with your heart and through the good and bad it can never be a mistake.What I will never forget besides the heartbreaking instances and lingering closeups of actors' faces mirroring the hurt they feel I loved the extreme framing in parts of just mouths or even abstract compositions of a ferris wheel in the bottom left hand corner and sweeping aerial shots from a winding road to the wispy clouds in the sky are the amazing performances. An early role for Canadian beauty Sarah Polley shows the burgeoning success she has found since Ian Holm relays how good he is with a more challenging and rewarding role than the hailed bit part in Garden State and Maury Chaykin with commanding presence in a short scene resonates both his humor and gossip yet also his sense of community in a warped way. There were also a couple of truly great turns from Tom McCamus and Bruce Greenwood. McCamus plays Polley's father with a very intriguing interior makeup. Truly loving his daughter too much in fact with regards to their presumed sexual relationship he always has a smile mixed with apparent awkwardness unsure of his role in her life. Complicated to the end it is his performing without words in two later pivotal scenes that shine most. As for Greenwood he is by far my favorite. After losing his wife to cancer he will do anything for his twins even following their school bus each morning to wave at them. That fact put him in firsthand view of the accident and the realization that sometimes life just deals you a bad hand. The most tragic and also the most realistic of them all it is his resolve that ultimately saves this quiet town from complete implosion.What it all comes down to is a group of people grieving together and helping each other cope with a horrific event felt by all. Someone in the audience asked Shipman how Dolores could ever get a bus job again after Nicole lies blaming her for the accident. What that person didn't understand is that the lie is what made it possible. By completely destroying any chance of a lawsuit against the bus makers no one is held at fault. A new lawsuit would have to be brought up against Dolores to truly hold her accountable so that lie then put her fate in the hands of community who in turn absolved her of any guilt she most certainly already holds in her heart. As the overshadowing tale of The Pied Piper shows a hatred that only leads to more painusing his magic for revenge rather than just getting what he wanted and leavingonly Greenwood's Billy Ansel and Polley's Nicole see the light in forgiveness and honoring those lost rather than treading over their graves with more and more hate. Sometimes doing nothing is the hardest and most difficult thing to do.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie could never have been made in Hollywood.  Hollywood simply does not produce works this intelligent.  This movie is so intelligent in fact that it is remarkable that it was ever made at all anywhere. It is not however unintelligible.  The entire film is told in a language well accessible to all  the language of relationships.Besides the stunning cinematography which transforms the very landscape into a character there are five remarkable aspects of this film the extraordinary storytelling technique the use of sound the exploration of relationships the acting and the way the whole film reaches in and grabs your heart wrenches it about and still leaves you feeling lightened and strangely refreshed at the end.The most remarkable of these aspects is the storytelling.  The plot slips backward and forward in time like memory  a single image here a conversation there an absurdity a pang  just as a person would remember a sequence of events  nonsequentially.  Often when directors attempt this approach we are left confused or exhausted by too much artyness.  Not here. The film builds patiently but not slowly and it is impossible to lose track of the actual course of events.  Although there is a certain oblique quality to the views we are granted  we don't really know these people and it is clear that we are outsiders observing their lives through someone else's memory glass  there is no confusion as to what happened to whom when  and why when there is a why.One of the reasons we do not lose track is the truly virtuoso handling of sound.  All the sounds of the characters and their lives their speech their footsteps and other incidental sounds as well as the strong and poignant soundtrack weave complex scenes together with some very neat and complicated editing.  A strain of speech or music overlapping from its scene of origin into another scene not only accomplishes the continuity but also increases this feeling of memory that we are experiencing this entire period of time the way the people living in it would when looking back upon it in random yet connected pieces not as a single shot from beginning to end.  It also underscores another strong element of the structure of the movie the way we are made to feel the slippery sliding aspect of the future coming up quickly and inexorably.More than anything else the relationships in this film are the point  relationships between parents and children between lovers between community members with each other between humans and the landscape between a community and an outsider.  The film explores not only how these relationships are in plain and simple fact but how they change both due to fate and due to chosen courses of action.The relationships explored are shown in depth by several truly brilliant performances.  Of particular note are the characters created by Ian Holm Gabrielle Rose Bruce Greenwood Alberta Watson and Arsinee Khanjian.  Each of these characters is so real and natural and full even put together as they are in a sort of patchwork snippetbysnippet fashion it is hard to believe they are makebelieve.  I will never ever forget any of them and I do hope to see a lot more of each of these actors  especially the lesser known  in the future.  The Sweet Hereafter is a tragedy in that it hinges on a tragic event a bus accident which kills a number of children in a small town.  This is no spoiler the viewer discovers it very soon.  Because of this central event many people have described this film as too depressing to watch.  This is simply not true.  As my friend Teri so rightly put it The Sweet Hereafter is curiously life affirming.Yes the film affirms there are things that happen to us from which we can never recover as individuals and as a community.  Yes most lives even some young lives contain betrayal and disappointment and even horror. Nevertheless the film also affirms that it is possible to survive and wish to.  It also shows how it is possible to continue loving a person who has betrayed you or disappointed you even more than once just as it is possible to betray someone out of love without destroying the relationship. Sometimes betrayal is something you can't help and sometimes it's something you have to do to save someone else.  Now why this exploration leaves a certain lightness behind is something I cannot explain without spoiling the film.  I will say however that the experience of the movie left me smiling albeit wistfully that I watched it more than once and that I will watch it again.".

This movie is so intelligent in fact that it is remarkable that it was ever made at all anywhere. It is not however unintelligible.  The entire film is told in a language well accessible to all  the language of relationships.Besides the stunning cinematography which transforms the very landscape into a character there are five remarkable aspects of this film the extraordinary storytelling technique the use of sound the exploration of relationships the acting and the way the whole film reaches in and grabs your heart wrenches it about and still leaves you feeling lightened and strangely refreshed at the end.The most remarkable of these aspects is the storytelling.  The plot slips backward and forward in time like memory  a single image here a conversation there an absurdity a pang  just as a person would remember a sequence of events  nonsequentially.

Each character has a couple of elements each but they remained flat. The acting seemed strained and overdramatic not subtle and subdued. I simply wasn't convinced.Sarah Polley maintained a very cool bitter serious teen but it was too much. There was only so much of her scowl that I could take before wondering if there was anything else to her. There are some parental issues she contends with but they are never addressed. How do they affect her? What does that mean to their relationship? Ian Holm didn't do it for me either. His words betrayed his demeanor. The moments when he was riling up clients didn't sync with his manner in general. There was no smooth transition or feeling that he was truly that character. He spoke his lines well but I didn't feel that he acted them. He looked almost zombielike throughout the movie granted it's a somber movie but still.If I were to name the most convincing actor in the movie it would be Alberta Watson. Her character Risa was the most heartfelt and believable.I am judging this movie based solely on the movie. I knew only the plot summary before watching. I do not recognize any of the actors' names. I know nothing of Atom Egoyan which makes me more confident with my reaction to the film. I'm not writing to the notoriety of the people who made up this movie I am writing about the movie itself.

	schema:reviewBody "Ever since the truly excellent Exotica I've kept an eye on Atom Egoyan.But unfortunately Egoyan so far has proven to be one of those director's for whom everything clicks once and every other film tries to replicate the beauty of that one film and fails.The Sweet Hereafter is not bad which is already better than any of his other films besides Exotica. You can see how Egoyan tries again to create the multilayered psychologies of a number of characters interweave them and place them all in a slightly twisted burdensome environment and show us how they all deal with it.But it just doesn't work.It starts out okay. We are introduced to several characters and each has something interesting going for them and some twist to make them interesting. But it doesn't pan out. The personalities are never given the depth they need and subsequently I never cared about their problems.Over the story is overlayed the tale of the Pied Piper but this is done with Sarah Polley narrating bits of the story to us throughout the film. This might be okay if it wasn't for the fact that she just can't act and what we get is an amateurish reading which almost makes me cringe. Such a bad voiceover could ruin even a good film.We get no revelations about any characters unlike Exotica where every character is a little mystery that slowly unfolds. Here the characters are totally stagnant and nothing new happens and nothing new about them is revealed.In the end of Exotica we are given a beautiful conclusion where everything comes together on a narrative psychological and thematic level. There is nothing like that here. It just sort of ends. There is a slight hint as if we are supposed to find something profound in the reasons why Sarah Polley says what she says the looks between her and her father imply this as well as the voiceover. But it's too weak and by this point I was too bored to bother to even think about it.But Egoyan has an eye and there are a few great scenes. Ian Holm manages to turn mediocre and even bad dialogue into something great and especially his dialogue with his daughter's childhood friend is excellent.Sadly overall the film is just a pale pretentious and amateurish replica of Exotica. If this had come before Exotica I would understand  but sadly as it comes after I can only conclude that Egoyan is a director for whom everything magically clicked once and will probably spend the rest of his career trying to reattain that perfection.".

	schema:headline " The Sweet Hereafter of Bogus Film Criticism";
	schema:reviewBody "'The Sweet Hereafter' concerns the tragic effect of a school bus crash on the townspeople in a rural town. Many critics were afraid to judge the film on its own merits and placed it on a pedestal where they declared such a film off limits to any kind of real criticism. Unconsciously the subject matter affected their judgments. Here was a film about a very delicate subjectthe death of innocent children. The characters in the film parents of the deceased children were all shattered. It was as if criticizing the film was akin to criticizing these parents as well as any parent who had experienced such a tragic loss. But from the point of view of effective drama the film is virtually a complete failure. Very little of it rings true at all.Except for some very nice cinematography and an affecting musical score 'The Sweet Hereafter' plods along at a snail's pace. The director's intent is to display the range of emotions these parents felt in the aftermath of losing their children. But what is so profound about focusing on such grief? The main character a negligence lawyer goes around the town convincing the parents to join in a class action lawsuit against the unspecified person or situation which caused the terrible accident. Most of the parents he sees agree to join the lawsuit a lot of these scenes with the parents are drawn out and could have been easily condensed. The lawyer finally encounters one man who gives him a hard time. This is perhaps the most dramatic conflict that comes up during the film. But this one towns person's opposition to joining the lawsuit is completely vague. Why is he so against joining the lawsuit? Why is so angry at the lawyer? Because he feels the lawyer is profiting at the expense of the townspeople? Even so is it really believable that he doesn't want to get to the bottom of what happened as opposed to simply dropping the whole case? The ending of the film is even more unbelievable. The negligence lawyer never seems to have a definitive plan to try the case. He alludes to various factors that caused the accident such as a faulty guard rail or a defective bolt inside the bus. A real negligence lawyer would never have taken such a huge case in the first place without feeling that he could be successful. It almost seems like he thinks that he uncover the 'truth' during the discovery process. A real lawyer would have already had some tangible evidence already uncovered that would have convinced him to go forward. Furthermore when the young survivor lies in her deposition stating that the bus driver was driving too fast the seemingly smart lawyer folds up like a deck of cards and decides not to crossexamine her. A real lawyer could have made mincemeat of her but he chooses to quit the case and leave all his clients in the lurch. In real life he probably would have been hauled in front of an ethics board. And why does the young survivor decide to lie in the end? Why does she lie knowing that she is accusing the innocent bus driver? Why does she want to case to 'go away'? Is it that she's so traumatized by the accident that she simply wants to forget about it? Everything is left so open and vague in this film that we never understand any of the characters' motivations. Lastly there's a lot of lame talk mostly over the phone between the lawyer and his drugaddicted rebellious daughter. Seemingly there's supposed to be some kind of parallel between the lawyer's personal angst and the angst of the townspeople this is the lawyer's defense when that one townspeople berates him before the climactic deposition scene. All this conflict between the lawyer and the daughter is gratuitous and simply does not work cinematically. We hardly ever see those two characters together and their conflict is basically a separate story which has no real place in this film. The Sweet Hereafter basically lacks substance. It congratulates itself for displaying the raw emotion of grief but lacks a central antagonist to engage us. An examination of grief in itself is not enough to sustain an entire story. Whenever conflicts do arise in this film they are episodic unclearly motivated and for the most part lacking the ring of truth. If you're strictly into atmosphere and mood this is the film for you. But if you're looking for a strong story arc with convincing conflicts you will not find it in 'The Sweet Hereafter'.".

	onyx:emotionText "'The Sweet Hereafter' concerns the tragic effect of a school bus crash on the townspeople in a rural town. Many critics were afraid to judge the film on its own merits and placed it on a pedestal where they declared such a film off limits to any kind of real criticism. Unconsciously the subject matter affected their judgments. Here was a film about a very delicate subjectthe death of innocent children. The characters in the film parents of the deceased children were all shattered. It was as if criticizing the film was akin to criticizing these parents as well as any parent who had experienced such a tragic loss. But from the point of view of effective drama the film is virtually a complete failure. Very little of it rings true at all.Except for some very nice cinematography and an affecting musical score 'The Sweet Hereafter' plods along at a snail's pace. The director's intent is to display the range of emotions these parents felt in the aftermath of losing their children. But what is so profound about focusing on such grief? The main character a negligence lawyer goes around the town convincing the parents to join in a class action lawsuit against the unspecified person or situation which caused the terrible accident. Most of the parents he sees agree to join the lawsuit a lot of these scenes with the parents are drawn out and could have been easily condensed. The lawyer finally encounters one man who gives him a hard time. This is perhaps the most dramatic conflict that comes up during the film. But this one towns person's opposition to joining the lawsuit is completely vague. Why is he so against joining the lawsuit? Why is so angry at the lawyer? Because he feels the lawyer is profiting at the expense of the townspeople? Even so is it really believable that he doesn't want to get to the bottom of what happened as opposed to simply dropping the whole case? The ending of the film is even more unbelievable. The negligence lawyer never seems to have a definitive plan to try the case. He alludes to various factors that caused the accident such as a faulty guard rail or a defective bolt inside the bus. A real negligence lawyer would never have taken such a huge case in the first place without feeling that he could be successful. It almost seems like he thinks that he uncover the 'truth' during the discovery process. A real lawyer would have already had some tangible evidence already uncovered that would have convinced him to go forward. Furthermore when the young survivor lies in her deposition stating that the bus driver was driving too fast the seemingly smart lawyer folds up like a deck of cards and decides not to crossexamine her. A real lawyer could have made mincemeat of her but he chooses to quit the case and leave all his clients in the lurch. In real life he probably would have been hauled in front of an ethics board. And why does the young survivor decide to lie in the end? Why does she lie knowing that she is accusing the innocent bus driver? Why does she want to case to 'go away'? Is it that she's so traumatized by the accident that she simply wants to forget about it? Everything is left so open and vague in this film that we never understand any of the characters' motivations. Lastly there's a lot of lame talk mostly over the phone between the lawyer and his drugaddicted rebellious daughter. Seemingly there's supposed to be some kind of parallel between the lawyer's personal angst and the angst of the townspeople this is the lawyer's defense when that one townspeople berates him before the climactic deposition scene.

Using the same understated and unsentimental style he employed in Exotica Egoyan tries to make the story of a bus tragedy in a remote snowladen Canadian town an intellectual puzzle of sorts yet this story of small town immorality is in dire need of a Lifetime TV movie makeover rather than a deconstruction of its own willfuly obscure narrative. This is where the film is a spectacular failure  the story is too human for Egoyan's dehumanizing narratives. Egoyan is at sea when it comes to dealing with conventional emotions he would rather intellectualize as he did in Exotica and The Adjuster. That's why I feel the film feels forced. It's simply not deep enough for Egoyan. So what does he do he constructs a simplistic analogy with the Pied Piper not in the novelthat seeks to add depth to the original novel but feels too literary and selfconscious to be cinematic.Yet this is Egoyan's most critically acclaimed film and that is baffling. Ian Holm as the lawyer Mitchell Stevens is miscast. His accent veers from English to Canadian and back again. How do we take him seriously? Sarah Polley is also as understated as ever which seems to be her style. As for the rest they all perform to expectation which means we have to endure silences and odd offbeat yet contrived dialog. Egoyan's detached directorial stance which served him in so well in previous film is exposed here as a ruse. Where pathos and empathy should be invoked by the tragic scenario the director's own penchant for obscurantism clouds any human interest.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was mostly angry with this film. The portrayal of the incestuous relationship between father and daughter was downright dishonest a betrayal of what is now known and understood about the nature of abuse. Sarah Polley's character is initially seen as desirous of sexual contact with her father with no hint of the disgust fear and shame that such a person feels throughout these encounters. Somehow Egoyan seems to think that all he has to do is show her turning on her father late in the film and we'll all understand how wretched she really felt. Instead she simply comes across as a manipulator not as a young woman whose life has been virtually ruined.Small things irritated me. Why would bush hippies in the 1990's be wearing clothes from the 70's? Same thing with the interiors of homes where we understand that people are poor. And why would the daughter of Bruce Greenwood's single parent workingclass character have Shirley Temple curls? Did he spend half and hour every morning doing her hair perfectly while forgetting to shave clean his clothes or put in his false tooth? The correct answer is of course that seeing an unbearably cute child die in a bus accident is worse than seeing an ordinary one lose her life. It's so Toronto to sneer at Hollywood then steal its worst traits.There's an excruciatingly bad performance by one of the lesser roles in the film which makes you wonder how Ian Holm coped. He must have mustered every possible resource as an actor to compensate for some of the cringeworthy material and performances around him. We're supposed to despise his manipulation of the victims to see him as a predator of some sort yet we're relieved every time he appears because we see in him someone more alive than the dull characters by which he is surrounded.".

Despite this Hawn is likable and has good chemistry with Gibson. The trademark showing of her ass is once again here and Hawn parades her derrire in her movies even more than JeanClaude Van Damme. The film also features the gorgeous and future queen of soft core erotic Bmovies Joan Severance.The film has some good action scenes and plenty of on screen carnage and thanks to Badhams brisk direction it engages. The story maybe wafer thin but the film moves by so quickly it is difficult not to enjoy. The chemistry between the two leads more than make up for the clichd by the numbers performances of the bad guys Carradine and Duke. Carradine is so far from his great performance in Kill Bill 2 that you have to wonder why it takes so much inspiration to coax a performance from the man whose wooden demeanour has led to him being a Bmovie staple for nearly 20 years.Overall this is enjoyable stuff and typical of the sort of harmless and moronic fun action movies of the 80's.

Smokey and the Bandit High Road to China The Big Stealperhaps the granddaddy of this type of film and more recently some of the Jackie Chan films. The stunts have gotten much wilder and more numerous in recent decades including in this film. I love both Goldie Hawn and Mel Gibson as actors and to have them together in this type of film is just great.Gibson gets things started with a scary practical joke on his coworker. Goldie a divorced lawyer happens to drive into the gas station where Gibson is working and thinks she recognizes her almost husband of 15 years ago. He seemingly convinces her she is mistaken being embarrassed about the circumstances of his sudden disappearance. Goldie returns in the evening to spy on him from across the street. Apparently she intended to follow his car home but instead witnesses a confrontation with 2 men intent on killing him. The assailants accidentally kill his coworker. Gibson manages to burst out of the garage in a car but it is soon wrecked. He sees Goldie and pleads that she let him in her car acknowledging that he is who she thinks he is. As the station explodes in a fireball they drive off in a hail of bullets with a murder charge soon to be filed against them. They're off to the races! Sound promising?".

Most of the critics panned this film however i had a lot of fun with it plus Mel Gibson is always a huge bonus in any film he's in!. It has plenty of action and all the characters were great plus Mel Gibson and Goldie Hawn had great chemistry together!. However i wish they wouldn't have wasted David Carradine he is a brilliant actor in my opinion and deserved more screen time. I was expecting this to be nothing but average however what i got was a very solid and quite enjoyable little ActonComedy with fun performances all around. The plot is kind of silly and Goldie did get on my nerves a couple times however almost all of Gibson's wisecracks are hilarious and the finale was really cool plus some of the stunts were great!. Overall i dug this a lot and i highly recommend it!. The Direction is very good. John Badham does a very good job here with great camera work good angles and keeping the film at a very fast pace!. The Acting is awesome!. Mel Gibson is AMAZING as always and is hilarious here he is extremely likable kicks that ass had awesome chemistry with Goldie Hawnn and is really one of his most underrated films and he does what does best and i always love that! Gibson Rules!. Goldie Hawn is excellent here for the most part however she did get on my nerves a couple times still for the most part she was likable and pretty funny!. David Carradine is AMAZING as always and is very good as the main villain he does not have that much screen time and was kind of wasted in my opinion he still rocks though! Carradine rules!. Bill Duke does his usual thing as the henchman and does it well. Stephen Tobolowsky is good as the weasel. Joan Severance is okay here and nothing more. Overall i highly recommend this!. 12 out of 5".

While it does fail to attain the same chemistry it carries a different chemistry all its own.Mel Gibson portrays Rick Jarmin whose character plays about 8 different personalities which effectively demonstrate his incredible depth and range as an actor. Goldie Hawn is her usual adorable professional self. Goldie is a rare breed indeed as she is quite the professional while maintaining that girlish quality that the masses do hold dear.The plot is simple but the subplots are more than enough to entertain. Rick Jarmin has turned state's evidence against exDEA agentsturneddrugdealers. Since he's been in the federal witness protection program. But when he is spied and cornered by an exgirlfriend Goldie Hawn he realizes he must relocate once more. Upon discovering his agent has retired and the new one is a treacherous worm he must go on the run find his address book and locate his old agent for help all the while he's being chased and hunted by current DEA and FBI agents and the two men against whom he's testified.It was a lot of fun watching Gibson's personalities change as his character went from one life to the next looking for help and making his way towards his address book.The action sequences were quite good the comedic presence was well timed and expertly delivered and the movie runs to a satisfying conclusion.While it is far from Oscarworthy it is really quite entertaining.It rates a 7.310 from...the Fiend .".

Rick denies it  she leaves since Rick has been living in hiding for the past fifteen years under the FBI witness relocation program he wants to move on before Marianne comes back. He talks with corrupt FBI agent Joe Weyburn Stephen Tobolowsky who passes his information onto the bad guy who Rick's testimony put behind bars Eugene Sorensen David Carradine  his drug lord boss Albert Diggs Bill Duke before wiping his file altogether. Diggs  Sorensen head over to Detroit to kill Rick at the same time Marianne decides to go back  speak with him Diggs  Sorensen fail to kill Rick  Marianne helps him escape. Everyone from the police to the FBI to Diggs  Sorensen are after them as Rick  Marianne go on the run...Directed by John Badham I thought Bird on a Wire was a fun little action adventure with a nice sense of humour that I rather liked. The script by David Seltzer Louis Venosta  Eric Lerner plays like a mismatched cop flick along the lines of Gibson's earlier Lethal Weapon 1987 with Rick  Marianne paired as arguing exlovers caught up in an action adventure. This is where the film in my opinion works very well as I think Gibson  Hawn both have good on screen chemistry  are fun to watch as they trade insults. There are some amusing oneliners the action scenes are pretty good with some decent vehicular mayhem  fight scenes. The bad guy's aren't great as they don't get much to do  aren't evil enough for my liking in fact they disappear from the middle third almost entirely. At less than two hours Bird on a Wire never outstays it's welcome it moves along at a nice pace although the farm scene might have cut down or removed entirely as it serves no real purpose  generally speaking I aways have fun whenever I've seen it.Director Badham does alright there are some neat action scenes including a cool car chase a motorbike chase  scene in which a helicopter chases a plane! There's some nice explosions  fights too although you may feel like me it was cut down to get a lower rating as some of the dubbing isn't great  it's all but bloodless. I have to say Goldie Hawn really does look rather good in this I wouldn't be surprised to learn that a body double was used on occasion but she looks pretty sexy in this.Technically the film is well made with high production values although how did Rick  Marianne get from that beam on top of the hotel to the window they let themselves in through? The acting is pretty good  as I said Gibson  Hawn are both very likable in this Carradine  Duke are wasted in minor bad guy roles  despite near topbilling on the credits Joan Severance gets about 5 minutes screen time.Bird on a Wire is a likable fun light hearted not to violent  entertaining action adventure that I personally liked. All things considered I think you could do a lot worse.".

	schema:reviewBody "Goldie Hawn gives a performance which more than makes up for some of the short comings of this cliched comedy. Hawn is laugh out loud funny in this film as the spoiled lawyer for which she was perfectly cast and it is one of the funniest roles I have seen her in. The scene where she is driving around using Mel Gibsons foot as the gas pedal is hilarious and again when she is being chased by chimps I found myself in hysterics. Surprising considering I'm not usually a fan of this kind of comedy.Sometimes the laughs are few and far between and this is pretty much your average run of the mill film where someone is on the run to prove their innocence despite this there is something endearing about it. There is no doubt Goldie is that endearing quality backed up by Gibson who to his credit gives a good performance and a script which is relatively original. If your fan of Ms Hawn or if your just looking for a laugh without much thought then I would recommend this film. 8 out of 10".

Every time she was in trouble which was often it was Oh God! Oh God! Oh God!Puhleeze stop with the bimbo blasphemy. I am so sick of people doing this especially women who are the worst abusers and especially dumb blondes. Anyway the profanity in addition to the abovementioned made this film deserve an R rating not PG13. How many movies have we seen where that is the case? Parents beware of films labeled PG13.If none of this stuff bothers you in the least and you like a fun comedyadventure then I heartily recommend the movie. You'll get a lot of laughs and entertainment out of this. Hawn and Mel Gibson are always in some kind of trouble and they are a likable couple to watch. This movie personifies both actors Mel the handsome macho guy with the sense of humor and Goldie the cutie who is smarter than she looks.... and not as innocent either. She really likes to show off her butt in this film. It's nice but the fanny jokes are overdone here.The bad guys in the movie? The DEA who else? That's Hollywood's most hated group I think even more than the military. Anyone who might takes drugs away from them is a definite enemy of movie producers directors and actors!In this weakplotted film our two buddies are chased all over the country and we viewers just go along for the bumpy and crazy ride.".

	schema:reviewBody "Yeah OK well the coverart is horrible but the movie itself is actually quite pleasant and entertaining to watch. Sure it's no Lethal Weapon but it sure is a good action comedy that entertains well.The movie doesn't really have much story and even the little story elements that are present in the movie are far from interesting. It's weak and simple but yet the movie is made interesting and carried by Mel Gibson and Goldie Hawn who have a surprising good chemistry and the many action sequences present in the movie that are not the best you've ever seen but entertaining nevertheless.The movie serves its purpose well. The comedy elements in the movie work out well enough to make this an entertaining movie to watch. The characters aren't the best ever and are all quite formulaic but it's sort of fitting for a movie like this.Mel Gibson does a good job in this movie. Basically he in this movie plays a bit of the same way as he plays his Riggs character in the Lethal Weapon movies. No wonder Gibson made this movie just after Lethal Weapon 2 and he clearly was in the mood for more. The result of that can be seen in this movie. He provides the movie certainly with a certain extra and gives the movie some extra fun. On top of that he and Goldie Hawn work pretty well as a screen duo which does provide the movie with some of its best moments. Goldie Hawn herself is also surprising good in this movie and she shows that she can handle the genre. The villains are definitely a disappointing aspect about this movie. I mean when the main villains are being played by David Carradine and Bill Duke you would expect something more of it. The villains play a very little part in the movie and in it they get very little interesting to do. A waste of two fine actors. Some goes for the rest of the supporting cast.The movie is from 1990 but it still has an '80's feeling over it. Meaning lots of formulaic car chases shootouts haircuts and two main 'buddy team' characters. Plus some horrible '80's music. I mostly hate Hans Zimmer score from the early '90's. They sound like '80's left overs.The movie is nothing too spectacular but it does has some great moments. Also the finale does not disappoint. The movie is professionally directed by John Badham who never really made great movies but more movies that served their purpose always well.Nothing too great but the movie deserves a better reputation since this is some great entertaining fun to watch.710httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Continuing my plan to watch every Mel Gibson movie in order I come to 1990's Bird On A Wire.Plot In A Paragraph Rick Gibson helped convict a drugdealing FBI agent and was placed in the witness protection program. Fifteen years later his former fiance Marianne Goldie Hawn crosses paths with him at a gas station and before you know it goons show up to kill him and the two former lovers go on the run.Slated by critics upon release I have a real soft spot for this movie. OK some of the things wouldn't fly today Gibson's gay hairdresser for example and Goldie Hawn has been remaking the same movie over and over since Foul Play. But I do like it. Most of it is down to the two leads. The movie pretty much let's Gibson do his own thing and he seemed to be having fun but at times he does come off as a bit of a jerk!! At his best here he is a bit of a watered down Riggs!! Hell his pose on the posterDVD cover is almost identical to the one on Lethal Weapon 2. As for Hawn she looked great!! I'm of the opinion that Goldie Hawn got more and more attractive as she got older peaking in the Bird On A Wire and HouseSitter era. She handles all her action scenes romantic scenes and comedy scenes wonderfully!! And man what an ass!! I love it.I also like John Badham as a director he has directed more than a few movies that I love!!I'm of the opinion that it was solely the star power of Gibson and of course Hawn that made the movie a hit as it grossed 70 million at the domestic box office to finish the year the 16th highest grossing movie of 1990!! A head of Rocky V Godfather 3 Goodfells and Edward Scissorhands despite some truly awful reviews!! Including one that said Bird On A Wire fails on every level".

	schema:reviewBody "If you love adventure movies this is one of the best I've seen. While around the same time as Air America in 1990 here might of been one for Gibson lovers that would take second place if choosing to go and see it. I have to be honest I really enjoyed this movie. It has a great story background constant action but also humour as well as if on Goldie Hawn's part. At times it seems she's overacting and it could just be her character doing it. Mel and her make a great duo. Long haired Gibson as Rick who worked for Air America had discovered he'd be used in some illegal smuggling has gone under a new identity. Some bad arses still after him Carradine and Duke. He used to be the fun of the party in Hawn's life while being a husband too. Presumed to be dead by Hawn her absolution is thrown back into doubt while recognizing Gibson at a gas station. Later that same night the desperate pain in the butt Gibson and I'm two terming it there is forced to team up with Hawn and another adventure like olden days begins. You so much wanna be part of their adventure. Here's one of those smaller mainstream movies that really surprises you like they did in the nineties. And when the climax scene is set spectacularly in a zoo with lions running loose whatever what a choice it just another reason. Think of the original climactic setting in Kill Bill 1. This movie is just fun all the way with funny circumstances of course taking place during the action. It's what so good about this it's not just action but it's comedy on a even keel I like. Too we also feel Mel's bullet in the bum. He plays his irresponsible character here well. Carradine as the chief bad guy also impresses. The only thing that really sucks here is it strung together title. It's just out of whack unfitting no title appeal as if unthinkingly slapped on at the last moment.".

The key to this further development is Petra played by Rosanna Munter. She is hyperactive one of those schoolchildren who simply cannot stay still relax and enjoy life in a passive manner. The role is played perfectly and adds a new dimension to Eva's pensiveness. None of the characters is onesided. They all react to different situations in ways the viewer might not have expected.Although the main story is a romantic one the film keeps the viewer interested with many subplots even if these are quiet subdued ones in the best Swedish traditions. The fiasco scene is of course nothing of the sort. It is tumultuous as one would expect and helps the variations of mood and pace which are so central to this film.Another highlight is the rendering of the song 'Mercedes Benz' by Eva and Petra. It is not only enjoyable. It also underlines the contrast in their characters through both pronounced and subtle body language and facial expression.Although I am older than the target age group of both the series and this film I thoroughly enjoyed the former and consider the latter to be even better.".

It's a good thing too because I can't see Joe Cotton pulling off asphyxiation and orgasms quite like Ms. Neri can. The Baron's assistant Charles has long been enamored with Tania and wishes to woo her now that her old man is kaput. Tania loves his mind but can't quite picture jumping into the sack with the old horny bastard without a serious makeover. That is where village dolt Thomas steps in as the halfwit has been graced with good looks and brings the thunder into Tania's private lab if you catch my drift. Now all Tania has to do is put Charles's brain into Thomas' body and voil! instant marriage material. Too bad Mickey Hargitay as a persistent police captain keeps inquiring into what exactly her father's experiments entailed and why did he associate with graverobbers. Definitely one of the most amusing and downright bizarre endings I have ever seen. Who knew the sight of a mutilated corpse got her juices flowing?I give this film a lot of credit by retelling the story of Frankenstein as apposed to the more faithful to the mythos Hammer films which is geared more for the hardcore eurohorror fans. Rosalba Neri is extremely engaging as the sexy doctor and commands your attention in every scene not just her nude ones. The supporting cast does a great job as well with a special salute to Herbert Fux as a slimy graverobber. My major complaint is that this film looks like it was edited with a samurai sword. Scenes appear for a second then disappear without any reason whatsoever. The version I saw was the 84 minute cut though I wonder what was excised from the film as most of the gore and plenty of nudity still remained. On a side note this is the third consecutive film in the Chilling Classics collection that features an adult woman sexually seducing a mentally challenged manchild. This is not a trend I would like to see continue thank you very much. Grab some popcorn and enjoy this guilty pleasure.".

It also deserves less than 5 due to a pretty crummy monster both in appearance and mannerisms. Makes one long for the days of Glenn Strange or even Kiwi Kingston.

She carries this movie pretty much by herselfJoseph Cotton is good as her father but he is killed off early and Mickey Hargitay isn't bad but is horribly miscast as a 19th century police detective. Probably more than in any other of her movies Neri stays dressed here. But the two scenes in which she does shed her Victorian garments are VERY memorable and not for the usual reasons. In one scene she helps her wouldbe lover kill a handsome but idiotic handyman by having sex with the guy while her accomplice smothers him with a pillow but her evil and lustful character doesn't let the guy's untimely death interruptus the coitus. The look on her face as she has the little death well after her sex partner has had the big one and her poor wouldbe lover can only watch is amazing and very perverse. There's probably not another actress that could have or would have pulled it off. The final scene if anything is even more warped so much so that it was censored from many prints. Let's just say that this nymphomaniacal Frankenstein just can't resist Frankenstein's monster and the sight of the two of them on the operating table stops even the rampaging villagers with torches dead in their tracks.Is this is a classic Frankenstein movie? Well no. It resembles the Mel Brooks comedy Young Frankenstein more than the Hammer films or the Universal classics but it is reasonably wellmade definitely pretty entertaining and it is if nothing else the sexiest Frankenstein movie ever.".

You see Tania Frankenstein though a doctor and scientist in her own right is concerned with really nothing more than satiating her primal desires for the stable boy and making some super sex slave by using his body with the excellent brain of a man she does not love. The story is tissuethin here and one gets what one might expect lots of leering and suggestive commentssurprisingly most from the female lead special effects that are not so special acting that lacks depth of characterization and not really much action or suspense. And while this film is almost barren in regards to good storytelling Lady Frankenstein does oddly have some aspects which make it watchable  not highly watchable but watchable nonetheless. Italian actress Rosalba Neri AKA Sara BayBey plays the Baron's daughter with some aplomb and lots and lots of sex appeal. She oozes desire and seduction quite well. Her performance is pretty onedimensional but she is quite lovely and plays overthetop a little too well. She is also very open with her performance if you catch my drift. Poor Joseph Cotten now regulated to European horror films for money plays the father in a brief yet competent performance. He is the star attraction but gone before the film really kicks into a gear. As for the rest of the cast Paul Muller is somewhat effective as Dr. Charles Marshall the baron's assistant and an admirer of the daughter for some time. As crimes and missing persons begin to unfold in the village policemanI wasn't buying thisMickey Hargitay starts to pump Tania for answers  despite what you might think not to her satisfaction. Where the movie really loses credibility is in the final third of the film where the suspect script weak performances and lackluster direction all head further South. The creature is revealed and looks quite ridiculous. The film ends somewhat abruptly with one of the hasty resolutions very common in the 1970s. While not nearly as bad and repulsive as some might want you to think Lady Frankenstein is indeed a very flawed film with some perverse albeit intriguing overtones.".

Director Mel Welles shuffles around some assured moments of suspense array of blinding images and builds upon the morbidly vivid atmosphere.

Lady Frankenstein  Daughter Of Frankenstein of 1971 is a highly entertaining Gothic flick that is labeled pure trash by some and praised as a terrific cult gem by others. I belong to the latter group and I am sure that most of my fellow fans of cultcinema will share my opinion. Fact is that Lady Frankenstein is even if occasionally silly or over the top an overall amazingly moody stylish and highly original Gothic tale that no lover of Eurohorror and Exploitation cinema should consider missing. As the title already gives away the obsessed scientist Baron Frankenstein is not the central figure of this film. Baron Frankenstein who is played by Joseph Cotten here has a beautiful daughter in this film and young Lady Frankenstein Rosalba Neri is just as dedicated to recreate life as her father is... I have been a great fan of Joseph Cotten for years and he is once again terrific in the role of Frankenstein even though not as great as Peter Cushing whom I admire even more was in the role in the Hammer films. Beautiful Rosalba Neri is great in the role of the eponymous young Lady Frankenstein sexy cold and obsessed at the same time. The cast includes several other familiar faces for HorrorExploitation fans most memorably the sinister Paul Muller Nightmare Castle Vampiros Lesbos Nights Of Dracula and Austrian actor Herbert Fux Mark Of The Devil Jack The Ripper... who recently passed away. Fux is best known for TV roles in Austria but his most memorable ones are still those in 70s Exploitation flicks. Jayne Mansfield's one time husband Mickey Hargitay The Crimson Executioner and Joshua Sinclair Keoma also have roles in the film. The film is not very violent and for early 70s exploitation there is very little gore but it is quite sleazy occasionally. What probably makes this film most worthwhile are both the wonderfully Gothic and sometimes genuinely creepy atmosphere and the delightful insanity that is maintained throughout the film. Overall Lady Frankenstein is an immensely entertaining and atmospheric Gothic tale that I highly recommend to all my fellow cultcinema lovers out there!".

	schema:reviewBody "Much rather than the trashy and exploitative cashin it's reputed to be Lady Frankenstein is in fact a remarkably impressive and very ingenious variation on the legendary Mary Shelley story! It all may look silly and of course it is sometimes but Mel Welles' film contains a lot more style and dazzling Gothic atmosphere than the majority of contemporary Italian exploitation flicks. There's not one boring moment in the entire film and the plot actually brings forward some bright story lines that widely surpasses the imagination of scriptwriters over at big studios like Hammer and Universal. Horror veteran and personal favorite Joseph Cotton The Abominable Dr. Phibes Baron Blood portrays the overambitious and slightly obnoxious Baron slash scientist Frankenstein who gets killed by his own creation after not carefully considering the dangers of his experiments. The horribly deformed monster he resurrected escapes and starts a killing spree in the area causing mayhem and fear among the villagers. Meanwhile Frankenstein's intelligent but equally stubborn daughter Tania continues her father's work using the weakminded men at the castle as reluctant research objects. The given that the mad scientist is a woman in this case is already terrific in my humble opinion and yet Lady Frankenstein features two supplementary sub plots that are definitely worth mentioning. The Frankensteins both daddy and his girl do business with a duo of filthylooking corpse snatchers whose characters are obviously inspired by the reallife killers Burke  Hare and unlike in most previous Frankenstein adaptations there's even room for sexual intrigues and romance. With her sensual charisma it's a lot easier for Tania to convince her patients to sacrifice themselves in the name of science... The makeup effects are rather poor but the set pieces are effectively uncanny and director Welles often succeeds in creating a tense atmosphere with the use of eerie sounds and a wide range of unnatural colors. Some of the mumbling supportive characters are difficult to understand but Rosalba Neri and Joseph Cotton are a pleasure to behold and they're clearly having fun in their roles. There's quite a bit of typical eurosleaze in this film but it never gets too graphic or overly vulgar. The ending is just marvelous and the whole concept of a relentless feminist Doctor is strangely fascinating! Highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "This cheap Italian Hammer knockoff puts a pretty simple spin on the much told Frankenstein tale. In it the Baron's daughter is the one who takes centre stage as the chief antihero. Rosalba Neri plays Lady Frankenstein. She appeared in other Eurotrash productions from the same time such as Slaughter Hotel but in this film she is definitely given a more prominent role. She is paired with Joseph Cotten who plays the famous Baron in one of his many horror appearances in Europe at the tail end in his career. He is killed off pretty early in the proceedings though and leaves the picture to Neri to lead.A deformed psychopathic monster has been unleashed by these irresponsible people and he proceeds to lurk around the local area killing random people. This leads the authorities onto the Frankensteins. The chief inspector is played by none other than cult actor Mickey Hargitay. This is without doubt the most restrained performance I have ever seen him turn in which is a shame. He seems terribly miscast unfortunately as Hargitay's brand of overacting never gets a chance to be utilised in his boring role.Ultimately Lady Frankenstein is another typical example of the sexhorror film from early 70's Europe. There aren't many surprises here but I expect that it should appeal well enough to those who have a taste for this type of thing.".

The acting is professional the sets are quite impressive and the basic characters and story line logical within the fantasy framework. The music is effective and the special effects okay if not brilliant.Where Lady Frankenstein enters the guilty pleasure category is in the dubiously motivated but highly enjoyable scenes of various characters cavorting in the nude spouting bawdy dialogue and an overall atmosphere of sleaziness that seems more appropriate to a porno movie than a low budget horror flick. But let's be honest isn't that the main attraction of this movie? And it delivers the goods. For once the advertising wasn't overstated with the picture of the voluptuous female scientist and her creation and the tag line  Only the monster she made could satisfy her strange desires!The real surprise of this movie is the unexpectedly straightforward and quite dramatic scenes of Joseph Cotten as Baron Frankenstein and Paul Muller as his assistant creating the monster.These are classic moments straight out of the original 1931 James Whale movie with some obvious Hammer Films influence as well.Sarah Bay Rosalba Neri is remarkable as the beautiful scheming daughter of Frankenstein determined to create her own monster and clear her father's name. She really makes this movie work with very able support from Paul Muller as Dr. Marshall.Recommended for horror movie fans and people who enjoy movies in somewhat bad taste. There's a strong black comedy undertone to this movie that definitely can be considered gallows humor in the truest sense.".

If you've seen this movie you either stumbled across it on Italian TV or you have the dubbed version on the 50 Chilling Classics Box set like i have as number 24. And lets just say there's a reason why these movies are here. Because they're not very good. enough of that though onto the movie.It starts out with Dr. Frankenstein trying to make the monster with his assistant who's....obviously not igor for some reason. His college graduate daughter ? shows up and states how she just graduated with a medical degree cause yeah. there were so many female doctors back then. So she states how she wants to help her father with his work and he says no. And then he makes the monster and it kills him. So she grieves for exactly 7 seconds and then makes up a story with the assistant how it was a burglar. The monster escapes and goes on a rampage. OK i really can't believe they killed Dr. Frankenstein so early in the movie. he dies like...20 minutes in. and then his daughter takes over. which.... doesn't make a whole lot of sense but sure. So Lady frankenstein decides the best way to kill the monster who's now rampaging....is to make ANOTHER monster! oh yes how i love her logic. so her new monster she gets the body by killing someone and putting the brain of the assistant in it...i know. just nod and go along with it. So the monsters meet and duke it out. I love how the assistant asks why don't we just let the mobs kill it? and she answers with They wouldn't know how to kill it! and in the end he kills it with an axe to the head. haha. oh yeah nobody ELSE could have figured THAT one out. so in the end the brain switched new monster kills lady frankenstein. The End.This movie was just....weird. it was seriously like somebody wrote a self insert fanfic. There's no other way to describe this movie. there were some odd naked scenes too. like this girl was having naked sex in the park with her boyfriend the monster picks up the girl and the guy drives away. haha. nice guy. She then struggles a bit and dies from.....to be quite honest i really don't know what she died from. But whatever. It's Lady Frankenstein. It doesn't have to make sense. This movie had a lot of those Why? moments to the point that i just gave up. Movies shouldn't do that but for some reason i see that more than i probably should. So final word it's not the worst movie i've seen on this pack but it's a tad boring and full of many many holes and random things. So Lady Frankenstein gets 3 Frankenstein porn scenes out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "In yet another adaptation of the Frankenstein monster myth director Mel Welles with codirector Aureliano Luppi takes our now infamous Halloween villain to a realm where free love is just as popular as monster creation. The backdrop to Lady Frankenstein is still the same  mad scientist Barron Frankenstein uses dead bodies to attempt reanimation but in this reimagine his daughter Baroness Frankenstein returns home after studying to be a doctor and wishes to follow in her father's footsteps. She is young eager and ready to explore all possible positions in the monster world. Yet disaster strikes when her father's creation escapes killing Frankenstein as well as plenty of town folk. While the initial idea is to stop the monster Baroness goes a secondary route in hoping to complete her father's dreams by transforming the brain of her older husband in to the body of a young man named Tom. Love both physically and emotionally flies rampant throughout all phases of the Baroness' plans  and even when fire anger and destruction surround our characters it doesn't stop the love that they have.literally.Lady Frankenstein has the feel of a classic midnight movie. The scenes are dark the characters are underdeveloped yet likable and the scares are minimal at best. One could also argue that this film has that raw ambition that several Italian horror films of the 70s seemed to latch onto and give audiences what they wanted tons of flesh and large unrealistic plots. Lady Frankenstein was no exception. Do not even be fooled by the use of Joseph Cotton who was nothing short of phenomenal in Orson Welles' Magnificent Ambersons he is the quintessential Frankenstein doctor a few turns of a knob a few stares at electricity a menacing scream and you have the character played not only by Cotton but by most everyone who has attempted to fill these shoes. What makes this film stand beyond others at least momentarily is the chaos of Paul Whiteman's portrayal of the creature and the creepy seduction of Baroness Frankenstein played devilishly by Rosalba Neri to nearly everything that walks. These two elements keep you glued to the screen as the full 90ish minutes creep by. Will the monster get captured? What is Neri's endgame? Can we get some angry villagers? Do I suggest that you watch this film? Absolutely. Will you like it? That is a completely different question. Lady Frankenstein is for the classic horror viewer. Those interested in what Hollywood is churning out today will probably find this feature bland scareless and choppy but I challenge you to watch this at least once. It does demonstrate a small ounce of creativity in a story that has been told over and over and over again. Yep the production is limited the acting and voice work is pathetic but there was something about this story that was entertaining. The implausible nature of the story was elevated and the feeling of escapism  a good feeling for any cinematic journey  was explored and I think that is what makes Lady Frankenstein viewable. Again  one will not find themselves arguing theories about Cotton and his relationship with Neri nor will you question why Captain Harris cannot seem arrest Tom Lynch on any charges or that questionable final scene of staying in a burning building instead of running all for love  nope no detailed conversations will happen. But the sheer enjoyment of this film will remain. I do recommend but merely as a cult horror film teetering on nearly forgotten.Grade  out of ".

You will enjoy an amazing story of three brothers who explore some of the rainforests in Amazonian Brazil and interact with the locals living there in ways that are unexpected.

This story heads off in unusual but relevant directions quite frequently and the effect of this is to wonder what will happen next. The impacts of different tribes of the native peoples and the whites both in the forests and back in the cities make for quite a tense viewing. The only weakness I found was the last 15 minutes or so when the clarity of the film's story wandered and I found it a little disjointed.

If you like the indie horror series about magically animated puppets with a penchant for bloodshed you won't be disappointed. Frankly I don't understand onestar reviews for a movie like this. Axis Rising has a builtin bad movie factor but it's funbad in my view. The Nazis play up nefariousness for all its worth and Brad Potts is hilarious as Sergeant Rock knockoff Sergeant Stone. Paul Arnold cuts a George C. Scottlike figure in his brief appearance as General Porter. And Stephanie Sanditz who plays Nazi villainess Uschi gives a deliriously sexual powerhungry performance with a presence as eyepopping as any hentai girl the demographic for this type of movie could imagine. What else could the straighttovideo horror junkie want? It might have run longer a common flaw with Full Moon films but writer Shane Bitterling does a nice job balancing the storyline with his obligation to showcase a slew of creepy puppets. Kenneth Branagh acting? Peter Jackson effects? Polanski atmosphere? Come on! Not to beat the dead horse of believability but anyone who saw the last PM knows this WWII is not set in our universe in writer August White's version the U.S. jumps into the fray in 1939. Relax it's okay if some of the accents and period slang miss the mark. Enjoy the movie for what it's supposed to offer grue cleavage and puppets.".

It might have run longer a common flaw with Full Moon films but writer Shane Bitterling does a nice job balancing the storyline with his obligation to showcase a slew of creepy puppets. Kenneth Branagh acting? Peter Jackson effects? Polanski atmosphere? Come on! Not to beat the dead horse of believability but anyone who saw the last PM knows this WWII is not set in our universe in writer August White's version the U.S. jumps into the fray in 1939. Relax it's okay if some of the accents and period slang miss the mark. Enjoy the movie for what it's supposed to offer grue cleavage and puppets.";

One of the better aspects to this one is the fact that there's a lot of fun work to be had here with the continuation of the storyline. Not only by knocking off the previous film's villains in order to keep that storyline going but introducing the new one involving the rogue Nazi commander who wants to create a new race of beings based on the work of the puppets that moves this one along nicely. There's a fun air here in the Nazi hideout where we see the failed experiments play out as the reanimated soldiers turn to goo or melt away which launches into the many speeches or enjoyable rounds of temptation taking place in the lab where it really plays on the sympathies of those around him to really work nicely within this one. The second half here where it focuses on the plan to stop them and get their stolen friend back leads to some more fun here in the fullon puppet action that gets unleashed here. From the first encounter with the new puppets that are not only coollooking creations but given some impressive powers the later confrontation in the community hall as well as the series of action scenes in the German hideout that has a lot of fine action between the puppets and between the people involved which is what makes this so enjoyable overall. There are a few major problems with this one mostly the fact that the puppets are reduced in screentime to such an extent that they rarely are shown here. This one offers up far more scenes of the Nazi's standing around making threats or experimenting on their discoveries which goes handinhand with the few scenes of the kids coming to terms with what happened the day before which really keeps the puppets to such a small part of the film that they don't make much of an impression until the finale. There's a lot more this could've done to work them into the story earlier and more often so it's a major missed opportunity to leave this one with such a lack of action. The other big issue here is the rather obvious cheaplooking aesthetic throughout here from the few locations that are rarely changed up or look like they're all that wellstocked which give away the film's key nature. As that extends to the CGI bloodsplatter that looks awful as well overall this one really showcases such a lowbudget nature. Beyond these elements though the film isn't that bad.Rated UnratedR Graphic Violence and Language.".

Our WWII era heroes from the previous films Danny and Beth are back as well though played by new actors and find a postWWII Nazi plot to create an army of their own evil puppets to do their bidding using a ReAnimatior like green serum extracted from our puppet protagonists. Not that any of the films in this franchise are exactly brilliant but this one felt too jokey. I did like it when the franchise introduced the Nazi storyline and had our homicidal puppet heroes fighting the Axis Powers but this entry was just silly and also continued the unfortunate recent trend of Full Moon Features including casual racism seen in this film with in addition of an evil Japanese puppet named Kamikaze. However I do still enjoy watching little things fighting big things i.e. Attack of the Puppet People Dollman Child's Play etc. when it's not CGI so even though this entry wasn't all that good it did still entertain.".

I really liked the Sarg he was big and funny in my book and sadly he had to die. Usually that happens in horror the odd but cool guys die and same old same old that live. But the main character which i forget names as i type so i think its Danny i am sure of it lives so that i am happy for.And Blade is the usual awesome and cool looking puppet. I love watching him he brings humor and etc to the table to me. The rest did a fairly great job and it isn't the worst movie and its my FIRST IMDb i ever reviewed mostly i tired of the low ratings on this i just bought it off walmart and i recently saw it yea there is times where looks cheap or so like when Bombshell was shooting her teets guns and the two people in the background didn't run away as 1 would i mean really? Some of the puppet fighting was a little lame but funny. For me personally i cant wait if it comes out with a new one. But its my taste not everyone i guess. The worst one was with that mentally ill character barely showed puppets all about the love triangle this was more of a two part series so i like it and i rather have the puppets be good than bad or else be routing for the EVIL versions of the puppet masters than doing good against evil with them.

Nazis are not afraid to speak German in public and on U.S. soil 14. Heels are the perfect footwear for women sneaking around a Nazi hideout. 15. As menacing as puppets with guns can look there's a chance that they're VERY inaccurate especially if they're designed by Nazis. 16. Kamikaze is historically the first puppet who says words as opposed to grunting whimpering and laughing. 17. What the hell happened to Blitzkrieg and Weremacht? 18.

As menacing as puppets with guns can look there's a chance that they're VERY inaccurate especially if they're designed by Nazis. 16. Kamikaze is historically the first puppet who says words as opposed to grunting whimpering and laughing. 17. What the hell happened to Blitzkrieg and Weremacht? 18. Letting the person who created evil puppets go instead of getting him arrested by the army is a smart move.";

	schema:reviewBody "Rashomon tells a very simple tale in a very complicated manner presenting four 'versions' of the truth each from a party either witness to or involved in the incident depicted. It is not the film's intent to have you piece together a puzzle since that would be impossible based on how drastically the four tales differ. We know that lies don't enter the equation since the participating persons all claim to be guilty. Rashomon is not about choosing a version of the incident you believe is true it is about human perspective and how it shapes what we see. Even if we truly believe what we have seen is true is it really? The film opens when a priest and woodcutter are encountered by a man who engages in a conversation about crime with them and subsequently learns that a samurai has been killed in the woods and his wife raped by a bandit. These two details are the basic practically undisputed facts which make up the foundation of the four versions of the story we hear the bandit's the woman's her husband's through a medium and the woodcutter's the only presumably objective account which still does not make sense in relation to the others. In many ways the best thing about Rashomon is that it never reveals what actually happens or if any of the four accounts is in fact true and although we are not meant to solve the mystery the idea here is that there is no objective truth since humans are too selfish and dishonest to view anything without bias the story structure is still brilliant and adds a lot of ambiance to the film. The narrative flow is strong and the method seems fresh and inventive today despite countless imitations including one inexplicably popular one The Usual Suspects.Rashomon is very much a visual film. It would be reduced to unimportant and insignificant fare without the cinematography which captures the mood and feel of the jungle perfectly as does the score. The film achieves an epic feel very rare for films filmed in fullscreen especially during the battle between the bandit and the samurai during the last telling of the story. Kurosawa was also wise enough to choose a location for the film that would accurately capture the eerie slightly disturbing mood of the story. Just picture the events taking place anywhere other than a jungle.Rashomon is not without its minor flaws however. While theatrical acting Kurosawa was fascinated with silent film worked perfectly with films like Seven Samurai and Throne of Blood it does nothing but take away from the realism of this oft claustrophobic human drama. Yes Mifune Tajomaru the bandit does provide an interesting spin on his character for each telling and Takashi Shumura the woodcutter seems as honest and real as any character could possibly be but nearly all of that effect is lost every time Machiko Kyo appears on screen. It is hard to take her seriously and during moments when I should have been close to tears I was much closer to laughter. I'm not sure how much blame I would place on her as Kurosawa probably asked her to act exactly as she does. While discussing actors I have to unconventionally note Fumiko Honma as the medium who brings a wonderfully eerie air to the film during its greatest scenes.I don't think Rashomon is Kurosawa's best or most important film but it is still a masterful piece of cinema which is absolutely essential for any film lover. It's extraordinary how much Kurosawa accomplished at such an early stage in his career and without the benefit of the lavish budgets he was allotted for later projects. The film's main question is also still relevant and confusing today is what we think we see really the truth and to what extent does subjectivity affect perception? 4.55".

	schema:reviewBody "To have a film that holds the coveted title of being the reason that the Best Foreign Film category was created for the Oscars is one thing but to be able to back up that myth with a powerful film that speaks both about humanity and the strength of truth is a whole new angle. Often we witness powerful foreign films that slip through the lines of cinema regarded by so many as valuable assets to the film community but never see the gold of Oscar. In the same sense sometimes the most popular of those foreign films eventually become Oscar contenders not because they are worthy enough but because studios had the funds to allow bigger distribution to audiences thus allowing popularity to do the rest. Rashmon is one of those few films that succeed in giving us both a quality film and the accolades to represent it. Rashmon is a rare breed of film. The Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa took many bold steps with this film pointing his camera at the sun filming deep within the jungle and the mockery of truth that it is unlikely that you could go to a modern day Hollywood film without seeing one of these techniques being borrowed. His bold storytelling creative camera work and powerful characters give us a unique story that should be included in everyone's film library.While the characters were strong the direction was flawless and the story was compelling there is a theme that needs to be discussed while talking about Rashmon. This is the story of murder betrayal and rape and in any typical courthouse film you would have some spineless witness finally break down and confess the truth. At the end of these films the truth is discovered but not in Rashmon. Kurosawa gives us the black sheep of themes by never really giving us what we really wanted from the beginning of this story. As I began this film I thought I was going to get a clearcut story with honesty and troubled souls but instead I was handed no prize at the end. What I sought after the most is not handed to me in a Happy Meal container at the end but instead trapped still within the film. Kurosawa gives us the meaning behind the story that there possibly is no way of knowing the true truth. Four different souls seeing the same event all culminating to four different results means that the truth may never be known. Kurosawa has taken the story and provided us with the main character being truth and like Kaiser Soze the greatest trick it ever pulled was convincing us that it didn't exist. Deep within Rashmon the truth is hidden and it may never emerge but that is what Kurosawa intended. A viewer could walk away from this film after several viewings and discover different truths about the characters and story. This is a constantly evolving film that will continually get better with time.Outside of these beautiful themes Rashmon is a flawless film. From the execution of the actors to the simplicity of the direction there is plenty in this film to keep your mind busy and your jaw nearly dragging on the floor. To begin the performance by Toshiro Mifune ranks among the best in film history. In each of the stories he is portrayed differently even in his own and with precise execution he delivers every time. He is insane passionate loyal and villainous all at the same time. While some may see his acting as eccentric or overthetop I found each of his portrayals as accurate and astute. When Mifune is on the screen his presence commands your eyes and you cannot help but become involved. Second to his performance is that of the troubled wife.

	onyx:emotionText "To have a film that holds the coveted title of being the reason that the Best Foreign Film category was created for the Oscars is one thing but to be able to back up that myth with a powerful film that speaks both about humanity and the strength of truth is a whole new angle. Often we witness powerful foreign films that slip through the lines of cinema regarded by so many as valuable assets to the film community but never see the gold of Oscar. In the same sense sometimes the most popular of those foreign films eventually become Oscar contenders not because they are worthy enough but because studios had the funds to allow bigger distribution to audiences thus allowing popularity to do the rest. Rashmon is one of those few films that succeed in giving us both a quality film and the accolades to represent it. Rashmon is a rare breed of film. The Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa took many bold steps with this film pointing his camera at the sun filming deep within the jungle and the mockery of truth that it is unlikely that you could go to a modern day Hollywood film without seeing one of these techniques being borrowed. His bold storytelling creative camera work and powerful characters give us a unique story that should be included in everyone's film library.While the characters were strong the direction was flawless and the story was compelling there is a theme that needs to be discussed while talking about Rashmon. This is the story of murder betrayal and rape and in any typical courthouse film you would have some spineless witness finally break down and confess the truth. At the end of these films the truth is discovered but not in Rashmon. Kurosawa gives us the black sheep of themes by never really giving us what we really wanted from the beginning of this story. As I began this film I thought I was going to get a clearcut story with honesty and troubled souls but instead I was handed no prize at the end. What I sought after the most is not handed to me in a Happy Meal container at the end but instead trapped still within the film. Kurosawa gives us the meaning behind the story that there possibly is no way of knowing the true truth. Four different souls seeing the same event all culminating to four different results means that the truth may never be known. Kurosawa has taken the story and provided us with the main character being truth and like Kaiser Soze the greatest trick it ever pulled was convincing us that it didn't exist. Deep within Rashmon the truth is hidden and it may never emerge but that is what Kurosawa intended. A viewer could walk away from this film after several viewings and discover different truths about the characters and story. This is a constantly evolving film that will continually get better with time.Outside of these beautiful themes Rashmon is a flawless film. From the execution of the actors to the simplicity of the direction there is plenty in this film to keep your mind busy and your jaw nearly dragging on the floor. To begin the performance by Toshiro Mifune ranks among the best in film history. In each of the stories he is portrayed differently even in his own and with precise execution he delivers every time. He is insane passionate loyal and villainous all at the same time. While some may see his acting as eccentric or overthetop I found each of his portrayals as accurate and astute. When Mifune is on the screen his presence commands your eyes and you cannot help but become involved. Second to his performance is that of the troubled wife. While her characters is the most confusingsuspicious of them all Masayuki Mori keeps us intertwined with the story by controlling her character with the greatest of ease. When it is time for her to be unleashed the true drama of the story is thrown in your face with brilliance and expertise.Overall I thought that this was a near perfect film.

	schema:reviewBody "Rashomon was Akira Kurosawa's first national hit becoming at the time the highestgrossing foreign film in America and even gained an Oscar for Best Foreign Film but almost sixty years later it still hasn't lost any of its impact. It is widely revered as one of the most influential films of alltime but unlike some other movies it is not a film that feels dated. The revolutionary methods of Kurosawa are still effective and onpar with the cinema of today  this isn't a movie where you say Yeah fifty years ago it might have been different but now it's done in all the movies. Kurosawa's techniques are still superior to most of his imitators. Look at the 2003 John McTiernan film Basic which copies a good portion of Rashomon's concept. Which is the better film? It's not a hard choice.The film begins under a structure which reads Rashomon on its exterior in a small Japanese village. It's raining outside and a woodcutter Takashi Shumura and a priest Minoru Chiaki inadvertently find themselves in the company of a wandering commoner Kichijiro Ueda and as he asks them what is the matter they both begin to relay the most horrific story they claim to know  of a brutal murder a few days prior.Kurosawa then switches to flashback and we see three different versions of the exact same event  the slaying of an innocent man the murderer played by Kurosawa film regular Toshir Mifune in the woods outside the village. Was it because of lust? Betrayal? Envy? Or insanity? We hear from the murderer the wife of the victim and a woman channeling the spirit of the dead man.Rashomon is brilliant. Some people have complained that the ending is a copout and sentimental hogwash but I think Kurosawa was fond of sentimentality to a point he uses a good deal of it in Ikiru but the difference between what he does with sentimentality as opposed to many filmmakers of today is that he uses to to ENRICH the story not provide an easy solution to all the problems.Is there resolution in the finale of Rashomon? To a degree. But like Ikiru it also leaves an open answer to its audience  this film questions us and our humanity and it says something about the human condition and our weaknesses as a species. Yet it also proposes that along with the evil is an inherent good and in my opinion the message of Rashomon is just as important and effective as its filmmaking techniques and acting.".

	schema:reviewBody "Akira Kurosawa was one of those directors the first from the Eastern hemisphere to develop the form and structure of cinema in ways it hadn't been. The story he used for Rashomon is now like Seven Samurai Hidden Fortress and Yojimbo a near archetype that at this point in the history of film has become formula and common knowledge for writers and directors. In that sense Rashomon is as important and entertaining as a film as Citizen Kane Battleship Potemkin Rear Window or Open City. Tee basic premise Four different people give four different accounts on the rape and murder of a couple in the woods. A key ingredient to the success of Rashomon is that the recollections given to the courts by the woman the bandit the as well as the four in discussion is that their emotions reveal their humanity even if their details reveal nothing or everything. It's difficult to say whether character goes over story here or if they have equal importance to understand Kurosawa's psychology with these people. The opening shot of the house is a perfect representation of the mature of the picture something that has fallen apart over time due to disasters that go beyond control of individuals. The man who heard the testimonies of the trial says I don't understand. This has been a discussed line since essentially he's saying the point right up front. All the information won't ease his puzzlement. The three who discuss the details of the crimes and confessions are crucial they speak for us what our opinions might be and we listen to each version of the story the characters the fears the pride the shame and the search for judgment andor truth in the situation.Along with being director and coadapter Kurosawa's mastery is revealed heavily in his use of editing there are short fleeting moments that hint or rather pronounce emotions and thoughts. For instance when we first see Tajomaru the bandit played by actionlegend Toshiro Mifune he is looking up at the sky bound in straps to keep him from moving and for a second or less than a second there's a shot of what he sees in the sky then back to his face which reveals an expression that borders on skeptical and a bit crazed or more. Mifune's part is of a barbarian but all the more believable as a human barbarian since he acts as such with animal desires he sees the woman in the woods and knows he wants her and while he reflects that he didn't have to have killed the man he did as a last resort as a man with an urge. This is intensified by a sadistic flee with his actions. What's intriguing about that first descriptionrecollection of the battle between him and the other man is that it seems like it could be the truth and to one viewer it could and to another it seems like it could all be apart of his hyperactive and trapped imagination. And in the attack of the bandit on the woman at first to him it's like a game then in later descriptions he feels a little more uneasy then later it's of neither pleasure or discomfort it just is. This kind of technique later happens with the woman who was victim who has conviction though is herself an archetype of Lifetime women the presence who saw it all and with the man who in the beginning didn't understand. In each telling the expressions the cutaways the lighting and movement by Kazuo Miyagawa it's equally startling exhilarating. That the film gives off such a hypnotic aura isn't surprising or perhaps it is for those in the grips of the emotion of it all the dead man's story is like the hook ripping into a twelve foot bass. The final accouter of the tale proves the most accurate to the common observer yet Kurosawa knows that's not the point if he made it as such to be bold AND had a definite concrete point the ending would be as poignant when revealed is the truth or what one could believe as the closest thing to it is. We know why that last person didn't want to get involved with the courts with what he knows his story is no more a revelation of any comfort or consolation to the listeners than the others. I highly recommend this to anyone and to those who have distaste to foreign films should view it once anyway it's certainly not a long movie and it won't loose its grip on anyone willing to give itself to the tales. For me it's another to add to my top 50 of all time.".

	schema:reviewBody "The more I watch and rewatch Kurosawa's films the more I am sure that he will be remembered as the greatest director of the 20th century. Although I prefer Ran and The Seven Samurai for reasons of personal taste I don't think I would argue very much with anyone who proposed that Rashomon was his best film. Made in 1950 it is so unusual and so far ahead of it's time that it takes your breath away.The story itself deserves a mention A husband  wife travelling through woods are attacked by a thief who ties up the husband and rapes the wife. This is as much of the story as we can be sure of. The husband ends up dead of a stab wound. How did he die? Who was responsible? Each of the three give their accounts before a court the dead husband through a medium! and each account is entirely different. A woodcutter who witnessed the events gives a fourth entirely different account.Each flashback is an absolute gem in itself and lives long in the mind. Toshiro Mifune as the thief exudes more raw masculinity and charisma that I think I have ever seen in ANY movie and creates a totally believeable character. Machiko Kyo as the wife is superb in what are essentially four different roles her own version being the highlight. The husband's character is the least well developed but since he spends a lot of the time either tied up or dead that's not really surprising.Because the viewer knows that each flashback is highly personal to the teller a vast amount of brainpower and concentration are required if you are going to try to work out what actually DID happen. Alternatively watch the film twice backtoback once for the visuals and acting and once for the detective work and philosophical implications.My favourite shot in the movie is one which starts with the husband and wife kneeling facing each other a view of the wife over the shoulder of the husband the camera then moves round to the side and simultaneously zooms in on the wife's profile then pulls back behind the wife ending with a view of the husband's face over the shoulder of the wife  a mirror image of the initial shot in the sequence. Absolutely awesome! And dating from 1950! Unbelievable!I normally try to keep my reviews a LOT shorter than this but I make no apologies in this case. Indeed there are lots of other points I would like to make I haven't even mentioned the central importance of the dagger or the relevance of the Rashomon gate itself. I could go on and on and on... however a better use of your time would be to seek out and watch this film...NOW!".

	schema:headline " A rare and a unique masterpiece from the master himself";
	schema:reviewBody "As oppose to its commonplace plot Rashomon as a concept is extraordinarily idiosyncratic and perhaps it is this striking attribute that makes it an undisputed masterpiece howsoever improbable. It vividly limns the artistry of contrivance innate in the human psyche owing to the importunate desire of humans to placate their insatiable egos. This manipulation of facts has no limits and entirely depends upon the skill of imaginative improvisation of the individual along with his level of comfort at skullduggery. The ability to misinterpret comes naturally to the humans as a desperate ploy to counter the adversities of life and that's what makes it indispensable. As a direct consequence of contrivance the concept of truth no longer remains universal but becomes rather subjective and a matter of individualistic perception. Rashomon pioneered Kurosawa's dream tryst with perpetual brilliance and undoubtedly played a pivotal part in making his name a mark of excellence in the world of cinema. Rashomon is a well knitted tale about a supercilious samurai his whimsical wife and a boorish bandit. The bandit inveigles the samurai into imprisonment and has his way with samurai's wife. The dead body of the samurai is later discovered under mysterious circumstances by a woodcutter. The bandit is captured and arraigned along with the deranged widow of the samurai. Their narrated versions seem such contrasting that a psychic is called upon to conjure up the dead samurai's spirit to record his testimony in order to corroborate the facts that seemed excessively manipulated. The samurai's version yet again differs considerably from the testimonies of the other two. Each version though different seemed to satiate the respective ego of the testifier. The woodcutter who didn't want to get involved personally later confesses to a priest to have actually witnessed the incident and comes up with a version of his own which falsifies the other three. The movie is ingenious as its actual motive has nothing to do with the revelation of truth as verity is merely a matter of lame perception but rather is to highlight the discrepancies among the different versions as a medium to depict the irrational complexities associated with the human psyche. The concept of Rashomon though well ahead of its time sowed the seeds for creative innovation in the world of cinema and has served as the undisputed benchmark of innovative excellence for well over five decades. A quintessential Kurosawa classic strongly recommended to the masses for its sheer brilliance and enigmatic charm. 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "These are the opening words of Rashmon and in a way that's also a summary of the entire film. It is the story of four testimonies of the same event that couldn't differ more. It is told by a priest and a woodcutter to a commoner as they seek shelter from the rain under the Rashomon gate. The priest and the woodcutter were witnesses in a trial and what they heard there made them puzzled and after they told everything the viewer is just as puzzled as these two. What happened? Takehiro a samurai has been murdered and Masako his wife has been raped the suspect is Tajmaru. And indeed in court he confesses to have raped the woman and to have killed the samurai in duel. Masako however tells quite a different story After Tajmaru took advantage of her he left and despair and pity made her kill her husband but to commit suicide just as she originally planned she's to weak. Then the murdered samurai speaks through the voice of a medium. In his story he committed suicide because of disgust at his wife who asked Tajomaru to kill him in order to accompany the robber. At the end we hear even another story from the woodcutter who was as he reveals an eyewitnesses. In his version Tajmaru killed the samurai in a duel or rather in a brawl that was demanded by his wife. Now what did really happen? Why did at least three of these four people lie? The reason cannot be as the commoner says at one point that everyone told what was useful for him since except for the woodcutter everyone told a story in which he was the killer. So do they all think their story is true? Do they all feel guilty for a reason or another? These questions will cause endless discussions once you watch this film. And the end Kurosawa raises another question If man keeps lying to others as well as to himself does that mean he is evil? This question is underlined by the crying baby the three men find in the Rashmon gate. Kurosawa's answer to this question is clearly a no the woodcutter takes the baby to raise him and the priest realizes that he is a good man even although he's a lier and a thief. But if Kurosawa had only raised these questions Rashmon wouldn't have become such a classic as it is considered today. He is telling his story with breathtaking images as when he's holding his camera directly into the sun when he uses the wood light and shadow to create a dense atmosphere or when he shows the trial scenes where he makes the witnesses talk to the viewers to make them feel like the judges. The fight scenes are all terrifically shot and the scene before Masako kills Takehiro can move you to tears. Rashmon also has some good acting especially the breathtaking Toshir Mifune in one of film history's most unforgettable performances as the wild robber Tajmaru always jumping around and seemingly untamable and unafraid. All this makes Rashmon a mindboggling experience that had me talk all night through with friends of mine and still stirs me whenever i watch it.".

It is told by a priest and a woodcutter to a commoner as they seek shelter from the rain under the Rashomon gate. The priest and the woodcutter were witnesses in a trial and what they heard there made them puzzled and after they told everything the viewer is just as puzzled as these two. What happened? Takehiro a samurai has been murdered and Masako his wife has been raped the suspect is Tajmaru. And indeed in court he confesses to have raped the woman and to have killed the samurai in duel.

	schema:reviewBody "Rashomon Akira Kurosawa's 1950 film about a horrible crime and the various versions of the truth that come to fruition during the investigation is absolutely amazing pure and simple. The story is told four different times each time from the point of view of one of the participants. The basic story of the crime is that a bandit Mifune comes across a husband and wife traveling through the forest. The bandit Tajomaru seducesassaults the Masako Kyo after tying up her husband Takehiro Mori and soon after Takehiro is dead. What happens between the times Tajomaru encounters the couple and the discovery of Takehiro's body is what is left to be discovered. Masako Tajomaru and even Takehiro with the assistance of a medium each tell their account of the story each taking blame for Takehiro's death. The fourth telling is from a passerby and the audience is left to decide which is the true account.I absolutely loved this film. I had heard that Yimou Zhang's Hero had if not as an homage employed the same technique of storytelling and perspective but seeing this great film was a real treat. The story is original and rich and Kurosawa always is able to pull great performances from his actors. I found Rashomon to be extremely compelling from start to finish and even managed to be really creeped out at one point. The psychic medium is pure unadulterated nightmare fuel From the very little that I know of Japanese cinema of the 1950's  1960's I realize that Kurosawa was not the only director but he certainly was the trailblazer and set the bar for the genre for decades to come. His peers were putting out material it was just fairly primitive. It is easy to forget that not every country's film industry was as opulent as America's To see this kind of film a film that is actually incredibly simple but so ingeniously conceived of and executed makes me remember why I have been and always will be both a student of and lover of film. 810 Shelly".

But it's clear that it is a technical and creative success. The story itself is not particularly satisfying which was most likely by design and the movie is carried by its structure and by the concept of the markedly different perspectives on the same series of events. The cast also deserve their share of credit for how well it works and the photography is excellent as it is in almost all of Kurosawa's films.Kurosawa's expertise makes the interwoven sequences of past and present  essentially telling two different stories  not only work flawlessly but fit together thematically. It's even more commendable when compared to some of the subsequent films that have tried to use similar ideas only to come off as pretentious rather than creative or innovative. Kurosawa was also working with much less in terms of possible precedents.In one sense the choice of specific story material could seem a little odd.The downbeat rather sordid scenario makes the movie somewhat less enjoyable than several of Kurosawa's other pictures which is admittedly a pretty high standard and as a result Rashmon is more a film to respect and admire than one to enjoy and take pleasure from. Still it does have significantly more substance to it than do most of the more recent pictures that have been deliberately downbeat or negative in their portrayals of humanity. Such stories are more trendy at present and they often receive undue praise simply for so being.At the same time the lack of sympathetic characters and the paucity of hopeful developments bring out all the more its success in developing its ideas about narrative and about reality ideas that are more fundamental and in their way perhaps at least as important as any specific story or events.".

	schema:headline " Who is more wrong?";
	schema:reviewBody "Firstly you need to appreciate the fact that everyone in Rashmon lied. This includes the Buddhist priest because he mentioned that everyone is good in nature. Even though he is aware of stories of rape and murder he chooses to live in selfdenial to have faith in the goodness of humanity. Therefore if you are still debating on who is absolutely right or wrong then you are probably missing Kurosawa's intention. We need to analyze who is more wrong than the rest. Similarly philosophy students will go offtopic if they choose to debate on whether Euthyphro was absolutely right or wrong to prosecute his father for accidentally murdering a murderer.The deceased samurai claims that someone removed the dagger from his chest and the woodcutter admits to the theft in the ending. So let us start from here. Two claims from two accounts support that the murder weapon was a dagger. This eliminates the possibility that the murder weapon was a sword. Therefore the bandit lied about killing the samurai with a sword. It is plausible that his ego as a famous bandit made him conjure this lie. In fact it is possible that he ran off like a typical bandit after the rape without engaging a meaningless fight with the angry samurai.Did the deceased samurai lie? Yes. Remember what I said earlier everyone lied in this film. The discussion should be centered on who lied the most. It is plausible that he did not commit suicide even though the murder weapon has been verified to be a dagger in the above paragraph. It is possible that the deceased samurai lied about his suicide to protect any remaining samurai dignity because the bandit raped his wife. So who killed him then? It is possible that his wife actually tripped and killed him accidentally with the dagger. To reveal the truth that he was killed in a freak accident is probably one of the last things in a respectable samurai's mind.Finally the woodcutter probably the biggest liar of all the characters' lies combined. He lied from the beginning filed a false police report made false statements in front of the judge stole the valuable dagger and angrily accused the deceased samurai of lying about the murder weapon which was later exposed by the commoner. He even reprimanded the commoner for stealing the clothes from an abandoned baby which shows how hypocritical he is. All these accumulated lies make his claim of having a family of six children extremely unreliable. In the ending the woodcutter was wearing a mild smile while walking towards the camera with the baby in his arms. The unusual eerie music played in the ending was also very suggestive. In my opinion he is probably going to sell the baby to the black market for more money considering the fact that he stole the murder weapon out of greed.Rashmon's ending was left openended by Kurosawa and I urge the audience not to watch on a superficial level. The ending is not as simple as it seems. This is Kurosawa we are talking about not any random 'grade C' director. It is definitely not a hundred percent happy conclusion. Another openended film directed by Kurosawa is 'Rhapsody in August' 1991 which I studied for my film module.Mao points 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "Rashomon is one of those movies that at first seems to have a lot of peculiarities but upon further viewing makes more and more sense. It doesn't need multiple viewings in order to be appreciated though... it's impact is pretty immediate. It's just that some of the things that seem more odd about it are much more lasting than one would think.The story is about four people who are involved in a rape a murder and a theft in the woods and how each tells the story of the events with a different stress in order to make themselves look better. What is clear is this a woman was taken in front of her husband by a bandit. The husband was killed. His sword was taken by the bandit and the woman's dagger somehow disappeared. With those elements a cynical outside observer hears the stories of each character and eventually comes to the conclusion he has from the beginning that people are selfish and selfinterested and that good no longer exists in the world.The woman's bandit's and witness's stories are more easily accepted but what do we do with the presence of the dead husband's ghost and his story especially when the priest points out that dead men don't lie? Akira Kurosawa often puts metaphysical beings into the story with the same matteroffact quality as he does any other character and to a cynical observer's eye this could be considered a distraction. However just the ghost helps illustrate just how far Japanese society has degraded away from classic values. Just as the listener of the tales tears apart Rashomon temple as the movie progresses for the selfish need of firewood the ghost no longer is held to the same amount of abstractly definite authority. The presence of the priest and his clenched grip around his faith in humanity helps create a dialog about how removed people have become from abstract concepts of good and evil. The ghost the priest and the temple are all a very important part of the story the same way the outsider's anecdote They say the demon who resided here fled rather than be met with the evil of human beings has dire importance to the interplay of relationships in this film.Kurosawa's skill is not just in dialog and relationships his visual acuity helps accentuate these themes as well. When the story begins the woods is magical even colorful despite the black and white photography. It is a woods of fairy tale with magical breezes and quiet streams. As the movie progresses the woods lose more and more of their mystical quality and become dirty and dry. By the time the battle between the husband and the bandit is played out in its final representation it is no longer a valiant battle of skill against two wellversed opponents its a stressful scary affair that has the two kicking up more dust than swinging their swords. The dust itself shows the degradation of the story away from the abstract qualities of truth and justice to a much more dirty ugly reality as promoted by the outsider.I don't think Akira Kurosawa necessarily holds the theme of this movie as utter truth especially considering the hopeful ending but it does seem as if this movie came during a very cynical time during Kurosawa's life. Many discuss it as a postwar film which isn't a bad guess. But even without it's affinity to the postwar world of Japan at the time it somehow has a profound effect on viewers even today.PolarisDiB".

They are discussing a recent murder of a man and rape of his wife by the bandit Tajmaru Toshir Mifune in a superb performance. Each one of them has a version for the crime including the one from the spirit of the dead husband. In the end an event with an abandoned child and the symbolic appearance of the sun shine return hope in human race for the priest. Rashomon is amazing stunning a masterpiece. The screenplay is fantastic and shows different perspectives for a same event. This was the theme of one of the classes I had of Methodology of Science many years ago the same event watched by different persons in different angles presents different testimonies. Akira Kurowasa offered us a magnificent as usual direction of a movie performed by an outstanding cast and a having one of the most wonderful black  white photography I have ever seen.

	schema:headline " Too drawn out";
	schema:reviewBody "Rashomon runs only 88 minutes which to me is fairly short for a featurelength movie but it seems this could have been accomplished in about 45 minutes or an hour. Many of the scenes are too drawn out simply taking too long to achieve what we already know is going to happen.You can notice this early as we spend minutes just watching the Woodcutter walk through the forest. There are interesting shots and directing techniques in this scene but it goes on for too long.Also see the wife's extended bouts of crying although her performance is great in the Woodcutter's version of the story in the scene where her tirade on the male species motivates the two men to fight each other.But it further drags as the wife takes forever to kill the husband then the husband takes forever to kill himself the final sword fight that goes on longer than it needs to. The outcomes of these scenes are predictable. The predictability is not the problem. The problem is that these scenes linger on when we already know what the result will be. We know the final sword fight will end with the bandit killing the husband with his sword because the Woodcutter has already swore that the husband died by sword before we entered his version of the truth. If we did not know the result this might be suspenseful but since we already do it just drags.The story itself I found to be very good but the case here is that the screenplay has been cursed by having been directed by its own writer. So I have settled on rating it a 5. Luckily for Kurosawa many of you don't feel the same way.Having said that I have seen Seven Samurai before this rated it an 8 and though it's damn long at nearly threeandahalf hours I did not feel it was as drawn out though maybe it would be easier to swallow if it were two separate movies.".

While this may have something to do with conditions in postwar Japan the cinematography is far exceeded by many films of the early twentieth century so it has nothing to do with the film's age. As for the story it is almost nonexistentthin gruel for a film that presents so many different perspectives. The lack of a story probably accounts for the painfully slow pacing. It takes a Herculean effort of will not to shout at the screen Get on with it! Still good acting can often salvage the weakest story. Sadly the acting in Rashmon mostly consists of odd poses and staring. For the first five minutes the lingering shots of overwrought facial expressions and contorted bodies can induce an occasional chuckle. After about twenty minutes you'll wish you had access to a dagger too. This tedium is punctuated by comically staged sword fights. I mean how long can two expert swordsmen wrestle and parry without a decent thrust? Again get on with it! Of the film's many annoyances the worst are the idiotic laughing of the bandit and the screeching of the woman. With his constant hahahas you have to ask is the bandit insane? Is he reckless? Is he a really really bad actor? As for the womanwell if she's the vision of a goddess thank god I'm an atheist! Once you hear the dulcet tones that come from this angela scream slightly more annoying than the amplified sound of fingernails running down a chalkboardyou wonder why a sword or a dagger wasn't immediately used on her.Sorry folks the Chrysanthemum Emperor has no clothes.".

	schema:headline " Confusion and Hope";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw Rashomon for the first time last Sunday on Father's day it was a good day to watch this film. The movie centers on the interpretation of a murder laced with a rape so most of it is a dialog among three men a woodcutter who is a witness to the crime a monk and a vagabond. The dialog occurs in the remains of a temple while a heavy rain falls outside. The theme of the dialog revolves around a samurai his wife and a bandit. The bandit sees the samurai and his wife traveling through the forest catches a glimpse of the woman's face when the breeze opens her veil and discovers that an impetuous desire to have that woman has taken possession of his will. He catches up with the couple and through trickery ties the samurai to a tree. He then rapes the wife. So far the story is unique. The samurai dies. The woodcutter encounters his remains and reports the crime to the police. The bandit is captured and tells the jury a story of the crime. The wife tells a different story. A medium is brought up and through the medium the samurai tells a different story. And finally the woodcutter tells yet another story. There is some amazing dialog between the samurai and his wife about honor love and dignity. Betrayal surfaces when it is convenient to betray. While the woodcutter narrates the events to his friends the vagabond lights a bonfire with pieces of wood he tears from the ruinous construction. The woodcutter is interrupted occasionally by his friends. The camera work in the temple is unremarkable with plenty of closeups of the aging and rough men. Same goes for the scenes at the courtroom. One strange point here is that we never see any magistrate. We learn about the questions because the witness repeats them. It is like the movie about the Prophet where the camera never shows the Prophet himself. The forest scenes are much better. Since the crime is narrated four times there is plenty of action in the forest as the samurai and the bandit fight each other. After the woodcutter finishes narrating the four different versions of the crime including his they hear a baby crying in a room of the temple. They find a little child wrapped in a kimono. The vagabond grabs the kimono. Despite the woodcutter's protest that the kimono had an amulet most likely left by the parents to protect the baby the vagabond makes a bundle with the kimono and leaves the temple as the rain ceases disappearing down the same path where he first appeared. The monk cuddles the baby but the woodcutter asks to have the baby. The monk refuses with indignation in his eyes. Then the woodcutter explains that he already has six children and that one more would not be much trouble. The monk hears him and with a smile on his faces hands over the baby. The movie ends. Until then there has not been a single instance of brotherhood in the entire movie. Until then the emotions have been on the sordid side of the human scenario lust envy betrayal deceit murder rape fights and lies. Some critics have commented that the ending is a license with sentimentality that Kurosawa allowed himself. To me the ending is the movie. In the film we are taken on a long trip throughout the wasteland of human feelings. Human greed and mistrust distort the truth and create confusion. From the affairs of adults emanates a toxic mist of confusion. People mistrust one another. Is there any hope? At the end Kurosawa shows us the hope the reason that makes one man trust another man a future life. The human adventure is an adventure of hope. The same message is found in Sondheim and Lapine's musical Into the Woods. A marvelous musical mixing half a dozen fables that end up very happily like fables use to end. The difference is that at this stage the musical is only half way through. The other half reverses the fortunes of all players when the giant comes to town seeking revenge. Here once more all the nasty feelings seep out of the human soul. At the end it is a little child who brings the survivors together. They decide to unite to care for the baby. So on Father's day with my daughter Laura I watched this great film.".

Then the woodcutter explains that he already has six children and that one more would not be much trouble. The monk hears him and with a smile on his faces hands over the baby. The movie ends. Until then there has not been a single instance of brotherhood in the entire movie. Until then the emotions have been on the sordid side of the human scenario lust envy betrayal deceit murder rape fights and lies. Some critics have commented that the ending is a license with sentimentality that Kurosawa allowed himself. To me the ending is the movie. In the film we are taken on a long trip throughout the wasteland of human feelings. Human greed and mistrust distort the truth and create confusion. From the affairs of adults emanates a toxic mist of confusion. People mistrust one another. Is there any hope? At the end Kurosawa shows us the hope the reason that makes one man trust another man a future life. The human adventure is an adventure of hope. The same message is found in Sondheim and Lapine's musical Into the Woods. A marvelous musical mixing half a dozen fables that end up very happily like fables use to end. The difference is that at this stage the musical is only half way through. The other half reverses the fortunes of all players when the giant comes to town seeking revenge. Here once more all the nasty feelings seep out of the human soul. At the end it is a little child who brings the survivors together. They decide to unite to care for the baby. So on Father's day with my daughter Laura I watched this great film.";

	schema:reviewBody "The movie which introduced Japanese cinema to the world. The movie which introduced Kurosawa and Toshiro Mifune to the west  Rashomon. Based on ancient Japan where Samurai's dwelled and women had no rights Rashomon is actually a series of flashbacks. The movie starts with a woodcutter a priest and a commoner discussing about something unusual that happened in the court that day. The Woodcutter was summoned to the court as a witness to the dead body of a Samurai. As the movie progresses it is clear that an infamous bandit killed the Samurai because of the lust of his beautiful wife. This particular crime though is recalled from four different point's of view. The bandit the Samurai's wife the dead Samurai himself With the help of black magic entering the body of another human and the woodcutter who was an eyewitness to the entire murder scene. All four of them present completely different perspectives of the same murder and it is left to the audience to decide whose version may be true. But this movie does not stop at being a murder and crime mystery. It also takes a closer look at the human psychology and behavior in different situations and conditions.The plot itself is very unique and engaging . Kurosawa has made this already interesting plot into an exceptional movie with his accurate and detailed direction. The Cinematography is also of the highest order which enhances the feel of the movie. Special credit goes to all the actors who had to shoot the same scenario four times but with different mindsets expressions and dialogues. Among the actors a special mention should go to Toshiro Mifune Kurosawa'a favorite actor who ruled the screen with his animalistic rage and passion. A very enriching movie experience which left me wanting for more of the great director. In my alltime favorite movie's list straightaway .Rating  910".

I recognize the qualities that make it great in terms of the theme i.e.a visual examination of the subjectivity of knowledge but their are aspects of the cinematography that are very offputting for a 21st century American audience. Most notable are the exceptionally long takes focused on an actor's face while heshe emotes for the camera. After the first few seconds of this type of shot no new intelligence is communicated by continuing to view the actor's face. I did like the realism of the fight scenes which struck me as much more in line with reality than the highly choreographed demonstrations of virtuoso swordplay that many more modern action films offer. Overall I give the film a 3 based on the fact that it's just not all that accessible to most modern viewers due to differences in culture and aesthetic values between 1950 Japan and 2004 America. Since the purpose of any text is to reach out in a meaningful way to its audience that inaccessibility constitutes a fatal flaw in the film. In other words it's dated badly.".

An episode  rape and killing in a forest grove is reported by four witnesses  a priest  a woodcutter  a commoner  a famous bandit named Tajmaru  even the dead man speaking through a medium was lying  each from their own point of sight  but the testimonies of the three direct participants were mutually contradictory and claiming responsibility for the death .

This is a magnificent picture by Akira Kurosawa starred by his ordinary actor Toshiro Mifune  being his international breakthrough one . Rashomon  the picture blends drama  suspense  emotion and results to be pretty entertaining as well as thought provoking . The movie is a reflection of life and life does not always have clear meanings . Its striking visual effects and evocative atmosphere made Kurosawa a name outside Japan . The flick is tense and mysterious from the beginning till ending and is neither boring  nor dull but enjoyable . This movie is known for its use of symbolic weather  throughout most of it there's heavy rain which fades away by the optimistic ending when the weather becomes sunny . The screenplay of the film has a twisted plot and the final gets an extraordinary surprise . This picture had great impact and influence on American cinema  in fact it was remade as Outrage 1964 by Martin Ritt with Paul Newman  Claire Bloom and Basic by John MacTiernan with John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson . Evocative cinematography plenty of lights and shadows by Miyagawa . A very early use of the hand held camera technique  following characters closely through the Woods . This film is often given credit for the first time a camera was pointed directly at the sun  even during high noon the parts of the forest that the crew needed to shoot in were still too dark. Rather than use a regular foil reflector which did not bounce enough light Akira Kurosawa and cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa opted to use a fulllength mirror borrowed from Daiei's costume department. The motion picture was compellingly directed by Akira Kurosawa with both philosophical and psychological overtones . After working in a wide range of genres Kurosawa made this Rashomon  often credited as the reason the Academy created the Best Foreign Film category. When the film was released internationally to rave reviews many speculated that Akira Kurosawa was influenced by Citizen Kane 1941 in the element of flashbacks that ultimately provide conflicting accounts of events. However Kurosawa didn't even see Orson Welles's film until several years after . It won the top prize at the Venice Film Festival and first revealed the richness of Japanese cinema to the West. The next few years saw the lowkey  touching Living 1952  the epic The seven samurais 1954 the barbaric  fascinating Shakespeare adaptation Throne of blood 1957  a Macbeth's version  and a fun pair of samurai movies Yojimbo 1961 and Sanjuro 1962  these are fiercelycharging  uncompromising pictures . Yet  there was a quieter side to Kurosawa's nature  expressed most succinctly on Living  The Lower Depths and especially the medical drama Red Beard . After a lean period in the late 1960s and early 1970s though Kurosawa attempted suicide . He survived and made a small personal lowbudget picture with Dodes'kaden 1970 a largerscale Russian coproduction Dersu Uzala 1975 an epic tale of adventure in turnofthecentury Siberia and  with the help of admirers Francis Ford Coppola and George Lucas the samurai tale Kagemusha 1980 which Kurosawa described as a dry run for Ran 1985 an epic adaptation of Shakespeare's King Lear . He continued to work into his eighties with the more personal Akira Kurosawa's Dreams 1990 and Madadayo 1993 . Kurosawa's films have always been more popular in the West than in his native Japan where reviewers have viewed his adaptations of Western genres and authors with suspicion  but he's revered by American and European filmmakers one of his least wellknown films but most agreeable pictures is The Bad Sleep Well  a transposition of an Ed McBain detective novel  being remade many his pictures such as The seven samurais 1954 as The magnificent seven 1960The Hidden Fortress 1958 as Star Wars 1977as Yojimbo 1961 as For a fistful of dollars by Sergio Leone 1964 in fact Kurosawa's style was the biggest single influence on the Spaghetti Western subgenre  as his Samurai 'Western's were copied not only in America but also in Italy .".

Now this isn't quite an exact adaption of Jack London's novel that would be difficult. What is does do is take the fine wildlife elements of the novel and fuse them onto the tale of a boy rather than vice versa as in the novel. This is more the story of Jack than the wolf itself. As a film adaption however it was the correct road to take and makes for splendid entertainment. There are many recognizable moments from the book however to ensure the film is deserving of the title. It's beautifully shot with amazing scenery so it certainly realizes the vision of the book. It also has top performances from the two leads and nice support from Remar as the snarling Beauty. The bottom line though is whether you're familiar with London's touching novel or not this film will warm your heart. Recommended to anyone who likes a good old fashioned yarn.Niz".

The protagonist befriends a mixed dogwolf called White Fang for its white and sharp tooth when he is saved during the attack of a bear . After that  he rescues to White Fang from hands a villainous James Remar who utilized it for illegal dogs fighting . The picture is based on autobiographic life of Jack London  as in his real life was a gold seeker or prospector . Furthermore  there remains the essential elements as the youngdog friendship  the gold rush  spectacular outdoors and snowy locations and several moving scenes . Authentic film stars are the animals  there appear the followings  dogs wolves  bear and specially White Fang incarnated by a magnificent animal  middle wolf and dog . As says the warning in the beginning of the movie  the animals aren't mistreated but they're well cared by an exceptional trainers group . The best part of film are the spectacular snowy outdoors  the marvelous landscapes are stunningly photographed by Tom Pierce Roberts . The film is wonderfully set in Klondike Yukon territory on the end XIX century and was filmed in sensational scenarios and gorgeous landscapes . The movie is a feast for the eyes and ears that captures the adventure feeling as few others have ever done . Ethan Hawke as a young adventurer is nice  he's a newcomer and would have much success later on  converting himself in a world star . Evocative and atmospheric musical score by Basil Poledouris author of Conan soundtrack . The film was one of the various adaptations about Jack London novel  though differs partially from the book other pictures were directed by David Butler  Lucio Fulci and Italian exploitation . The movie got an official sequel  White Fang II myth of the white wolf  though differs significantly from the book  being directed by Ken Olin  starred Scott Bairstow  Alfred Molina and Geoffrey Lewis .

The story is about a Yukon gold hunter's Ethan Hawke friendship with the titled Alaskan husky. Jack London's wonderful novel is methodical both in the book and on the silver screen this is a major plus. Every frame here is a joy as wonderful editing and cinematography enhance a deceptively smart screenplay and noble direction. Hawke one of the more underrated actors of his generation proves he can handle a major production and take the reigns as the primary focus. Supporting actor Klaus Maria Brandauer shines throughout. One of the finer family films produced in the 1990s. 4 stars out of 5.".

Along the way White Fang comes along and helps him and protects him. It is one of the greatest movies having to do with the gold mining and wildlife.

It's an excellent adventure film that really gets you involved with the story. The story off the famous book written by Jack London involves a young adult male's adventures during the gold rush days of Alaska at the end of the 19th century.Some of the Alaskan scenery in here is just magnificent. I have talked to a couple of people who have been around the world and they both said Alaska had the most incredible scenery of any place they'd been and you see evidence of that in this movie. They did a nice job with the action scenes in here not too much not too little and pretty realistic. The dogfighting scenes aren't pleasant but they aren't bloody either. The villains led by James Remar are nasty but not profane.This is not a typical Disney film at least at the time of its release because the violence is intense at times and there is some profanity. It's a rugged story about rugged people in a rugged land. These adventurers had to be rough to survive.Ethan Hawke plays the young manhero whom we all root for and the way he builds a relationship to wolfdog White Fang is touching to view. The movie offers everything but humor but they do throw one funny line in at the end by one of the villains no less.Summary a memorable adventure. One of Disney's best films of any genre. I am amazed there are less than 20 reviews of this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Set in the frozen wilderness and frontier towns of the Yukon Territory at the height of Klondike Gold Rush in the late 1890's Randal Kleiser's White Fang 1991 is above all a story of love and friendship between two young orphans Jack Conroy played by a freshfaced but precociously talented Ethan Hawke and White Fang a lone gray wolf.Loosely based on the classic Jack London novel of the same name White Fang is as eager and hopeful a film as Jack is when he touches shore in the Yukon Valley. But no sooner is Jack mugged by reality in the shape of a sly and malicious Beauty Smith played a finely villainous James Remar and his two cronies than Kleiser begins to unveil the unyielding unpitying hardness of nature starting with the shooting death of a shewolf mother to the wolf pup White Fang.The story of the film is a journey in more ways than one and Jack's journey closely parallels White Fang's in spirit and tone. Both are recently orphaned survivors vital spirits in a barren landscape. Jack's challenges start as soon as he lands a new land both harsh and majestic with potentially unlimited wealth awaiting the lucky and the industrious. The difficult conditions are compounded by the reason for Jack's sojourn though he claims to want only to work his father's claim he clearly ultimately seeks to redeem his father's death.As their stories progress and Jack and White Fang eventually find each other their fraternalpaternal relationship seems to take the place of the their absent parents. They care and look out for each other and at different times rescue each other from certain death. Kindred spirits both were forced to grow up quickly and they take on the odds of survival with pluck and mostly good humor.The photography of White Fang matches the beauty of the arctic landscape underground lakes and grottos ice caves and vast expanses of snow framed by distant mountain ranges. Cinematographer Tony PierceRoberts's impressive use of the wide shot  in some instance with the sled team slicing across the screen perfectly channel the adventurist spirit of the time and the place. Like Jack it's hard for us not to be completely swept away by the wide open scenes of nature at its purest. PierceRobert's dramatic crane shots from slow intimate creeps to quickly rising booms are also beautifully choreographed.According to Kleiser the film was storyboard from first shot to last. Given that so many scenes involved wolves or wolfdogs of varying degrees of tameness and training as well as an astonishing cameo by Bart the Bear in a fight scene this was a wise decision. Because of the limitations inherent in filming under these conditions Kleiser bravely relied on the pure visual grammar of film language to tell the characters' story. His economy of shots matching eye lines composition and distribution of elements in the screen space were carefully thought out and intelligently if not painstakingly executed.On a personal level I found watching White Fang to be a touching even moving experience and only very momentarily sentimental. In fact the director's reserve in not allowing the material to move into maudlin sentimentality is to be admired and appreciated. This reserve is the mark of a great observer.Successful sound design elements also contribute to the film's faithful and creative recreation of its sensory world at tense moments like when the ice is cracking under Jack's feet or when we hear a heartbeatlike thudding in more hallucinatory scenes as when Gray Beaver of the Han tribe finds little White Fang caught in a game trap. I also very much enjoyed the majestic soundtrack with its resonant symphonic score horns strings and unusually wind instruments working together in resonant and harmonic ways to make Jack and White Fang's story truly great storytelling.Finally the film's faithful and evocative recreations of the historical era from the stock photos and maps of the opening credits to the impressive outdoor sets of the Klondike towns combined with a refined instinct for storytelling magnificent locations welldirected actors including a small delightful role by the great Seymour Cassel! and disciplined choreography make White Fang a great film experience.".

And after seeing this film I think I might finally get around to buying it.Ethan Hawke plays Jack Conroy a young gold prospector in CanadaAlaska during the gold rush of the late 19th century. His story is without considerable peril and seems to take a backseat to the more intimate story of a young wolf cub who loses his mother and ventures out into the world on his own. Many people kind cruel and indifferent interact and encounter the wolf before Jack adopts him as White Fang.The scenes of the cub hugging his dying mother are heartbreaking and the training the filmmakers did with the animals is really impressive. A disclaimer pops up before the film begins to explain that although all the animal cruelty looks realistic is was done safely.The scenery is wonderful but I am puzzled as to why director Randall Kleiser didn't shoot it in anamorphic Panavision. When filming in breathtaking parts of the world it's kinda dumb to not take full advantage. The resulting picture looks a bit TVish. But it's a minor quibble.Basil Poledouris' score is also great. I am convinced Hans Zimmer might have also contributed as there are a couple of tracks that have the early 90s Zimmer sound. But it's definitely Poledouris' show and it's a shame that a definitive score CD was never released.For those of you who love wolf adventure and great outdoors movies this one is a must.".

I think that it would have been better if the ending had been how it was in the book. I won't give anything away.. White Fang is a moving story about the lives of a boy wishing to fulfil his father's dream and an orphaned wolf cub searching for survival. Set within times of the Yukon gold rush. Perhaps not overall suited for young children since there are some disturbing scenes. Not just for wolfdog fans either. I think that this film should be given a chance. At times it is tearful others make you want to hug your own dog by your side. Overall an amazing film that SHOULD NOT be missed!!".

Except for a few names of the characters there isn't a whole lot of the book in the movie. Putting that aside I decided to not look at it as an adaptation and view it as an adventure movie. It has a whole lot going for it. I'm not sure where it was filmed but the scenery is breathtaking. It would make a romantic head north looking for gold. The characters are fun especially Klaus Maria Brandauer whom I've always liked as the rugged Alex Larson. Ethan Hawke is a little goodie two shoes for his role but he's OK. The prospectors were right though. He wouldn't last a day without an experienced partner. The scenes with the wolves are very effective. The most memorable scene is when Jack goes through the water and a corpse that is being transported to his burial site goes in with him. There are some excellent scenes with dog fights bear chases training the wolf after he is rescued from his persecutors that work. It's nice when you can have a movie like this that can keep the attention of kids without the usual gross out elements. At times it's a little too antiseptic but that's fine. We could use a little antiseptic these days.".

	schema:reviewBody "I wasn't expecting much from a family movie that was awarded only two stars out of four by my TV guide but it's really quite well done. The location shooting in Haynes and Skagway Alaska is stunning. The narrative is clear  parallel stories of a wolfish dog and a young man that come together at the end. Fine performances by everyone concerned. The dog wrangler should get a medal. Jed who plays the dog White Fang deserves an academy award and Bart the Bear does too for best supporting character. This may be the best adaptation of a Jack London novel that's ever been done.Jack London himself was quite a character in the early 1900s. He was an oyster pirate in Oakland traveled to Asia lived in the artists' colony at Carmel and made his way to Alaska during one of its periodic gold rushes. He later took to hard dope and died at an early age but before that he produced some marvelously evocative stuff. His sketch of a ferry crossing from San Francisco to Sausalito in a heavy fog could have been described yesterday instead of 1904.That ferry crossing is the opening of The Sea Wolf which may show his talent at its best  until the love interest is introduced at which point the writing plunges into purple. His short story To Build a Fire is the first short story I remember reading in high school and I was duly impressed.White Fang is equally gripping. The movie not the story which I haven't read. I did manage to run across an excerpt some years ago  the scene in which White Fang gently closes his jaws around Jack's forearm and signal mute acceptance of their bond. It's a touching moment in a story filled with touching moments.White Fang alas has a stereotypical villain in James Remar a fine actor. He's the bad guy who cons an Indian out of the dog and taunts the dog constantly to keep him angry enough to win the illegal dog fights that Remar has entered him into. The Indians didn't treat dogs with any familiarity. They weren't pets. They were work animals and did what they were told. We are their gods says Grey Beaver. They were indifferent but not cruel.Klaus Maria Brandauer deserves applause too. He's an admirable actor whose career may have been stymied by his unprepossessing looks. His eyes are slanted at an odd angle that gives him a sort of feline expression. But he gets the job done and as Jack the novice Ethan Hawke pulls his weight so to speak.Alaska is great. Four time zones. And in the summer the sun never quite sets yet everything stops just as if night had fallen. The birds stop singing the forest and the towns quiet down and everything seems asleep although it's sunny enough for rainbows to form at three in the morning.Dogs are great too. They evolved from European jackals and were domesticated in Europe about 20000 years ago. It's doubtful that they were pets. They were helpmates as they were to Jack London's Indians helping to trap large game animals guarding the camp against intruders perhaps saddled with packs and living on scraps of food. They're social animals. They hunted in packs. That's probably why they're so much easier to read than cats who were solitary predators.Anyway a nice job.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the 1890's Jack heads to the Yukon territory to investigate his late father's gold claim. He finds a beautiful but harsh and unforgiving environment and meets White Fang a wolfdog halfbreed with whom his destiny will intertwine ...I read Jack London's wonderful book White Fang when I was ten years old and found it a very profound experience. Unlike most animal stories it does not anthropomorphise its protagonist into a moral or heroic figure but rather tries to present a narrative realistically from an animal's perspective as Richard Adams did in his books later. This to me was a real revelation nature is presented as cruel and relentless there is no room for stupidity or weakness yet White Fang's courage and nobility come from his inner strength as well as his physical prowess. It's just a really great tale a heady mixture of action travelogue and frontier history about man's relationship with nature. This Disney adaptation abridges and rearranges some of the events but remains extremely faithful to the novel's essence and doesn't shy away from the more brutal and heartbreaking elements of the story. On a technical level it is excellent shot in the Alaskan boroughs of Haines and Skagway where the novel is set and where London was inspired to write it with beautiful landscapes by British cameraman Tony PierceRoberts. The countryside with its ice floes pine forests majestic mountains and sparkling creeks is not just part of the story it really is the story. Combined with Basil Poledouris' fantastic score it makes the faroff place and time come to life with breathtaking immediacy and beauty. There's another reason however why this film should not be missed and it's one of the cast. The human actors are all fine  Hawke is a good goodie and Remar is a good baddie but the real star is Jed the dog who plays the eponymous hero. Jed like the part he plays was a real life halfbreed part Alaskan Malamute part wolf and unlike most animal actors who for the most part do tricks on cue actually gives a real performance. He's very still and behind his eyes he's both wild and intelligent always thinking. There are amazing scenes like the one where he builds a trust with Jack by gradually coming closer to him shot in two or three incredible takes and he's an incredibly beautiful animal to look at but he does more than that somehow inhabiting the character completely. White Fang is an outcast dogs hate him because of his wolf half people recoil in fear and yet he doesn't have a pack to run with. He's alone and his loneliness mirrors Jack's and ours. Jed somehow embodies all of this partly via his training and the filmmakers' skill but mostly through simply being. If you don't think animals can act check this out and you will be converted. For bonus points there's also a great scene featuring Bart The Bear a huge Kodiak grizzly who is memorable in several other films notably Legends Of The Fall and The Edge. A truly great family adventure movie from the pen of one of America's greatest writers  please read the book too as well as London's earlier The Call Of The Wild  which thrills and entertains us but also gently reminds us always to respect the beauty and savagery of our world.".

	onyx:emotionText "In the 1890's Jack heads to the Yukon territory to investigate his late father's gold claim. He finds a beautiful but harsh and unforgiving environment and meets White Fang a wolfdog halfbreed with whom his destiny will intertwine ...I read Jack London's wonderful book White Fang when I was ten years old and found it a very profound experience. Unlike most animal stories it does not anthropomorphise its protagonist into a moral or heroic figure but rather tries to present a narrative realistically from an animal's perspective as Richard Adams did in his books later. This to me was a real revelation nature is presented as cruel and relentless there is no room for stupidity or weakness yet White Fang's courage and nobility come from his inner strength as well as his physical prowess. It's just a really great tale a heady mixture of action travelogue and frontier history about man's relationship with nature. This Disney adaptation abridges and rearranges some of the events but remains extremely faithful to the novel's essence and doesn't shy away from the more brutal and heartbreaking elements of the story. On a technical level it is excellent shot in the Alaskan boroughs of Haines and Skagway where the novel is set and where London was inspired to write it with beautiful landscapes by British cameraman Tony PierceRoberts. The countryside with its ice floes pine forests majestic mountains and sparkling creeks is not just part of the story it really is the story. Combined with Basil Poledouris' fantastic score it makes the faroff place and time come to life with breathtaking immediacy and beauty.

Which is where one of two wolf stories this one White Fang begins. THE OTHER WOLF STORY IS BUCK aka CALL OF THE WILD.

Another point is Using a map You will notice that Jack London's story is superstitious THE OWNER OF THE WOLF ALWAYS IS IN PERIL AT WHAT PLACE IS NEVER CALLED BY NAMEname of city somewhere in the Yukon wilderness. Look at the map of Canada again Wilderness is state EAST OF YUKON STATE what state extends NORTHWARD UNTIL THE NORTH POLE AREA.

Most of the film involves Jack and his new partner Alex played by Klaus Maria Brandauer overcoming various challenges and hostility from both animals and people until they do eventually make it to his father's claim and the journey was well worth it. The acting is very solid from everyone all involved and even though at times it can be quite violent for the animals at least you can't help but be astounded by the production values and amount of time they must have spent training these animals up to produce such realistic fight scenes.Finally this is definitely an enjoyable film to watch for both children and adults with some of the most beautiful scenic photography I have ever seen!".

Mature is headon one of the screens alltime great performers and his deadpan expressions prove that an actor need not try to act just be oneself. This movie was shot three years after he got his haircut from Delilah and it shows the versatility of this guy with one of Hollywood's most ethnic faces. Jane Russell is smashing as the costar here and her closeups have never been more telling as to her true beauty without zooming in on her bra and like Mature she too is superb just non acting and being herself. Their kissing scenes come off quite authentically too. Vince Price is perfect as the nogood gambling hubby and Brad Dexter provides a topnotch lecher role. Hoagy is Hoagy as Hoagy always is in these adventure tales playing his piano and weaving through the plot. A perfect escape movie.".

Jane Russell is smashing as the costar here and her closeups have never been more telling as to her true beauty without zooming in on her bra and like Mature she too is superb just non acting and being herself. Their kissing scenes come off quite authentically too. Vince Price is perfect as the nogood gambling hubby and Brad Dexter provides a topnotch lecher role. Hoagy is Hoagy as Hoagy always is in these adventure tales playing his piano and weaving through the plot. A perfect escape movie.";

	schema:reviewBody "Although it's ostensibly a murder mystery The Las Vegas Story with its romantic subplot musical interludes and actionpacked finale looks more like a movie that was conceived as a piece of entertainment with something for everyone. This impression is reinforced by its rather breezy atmosphere which at times seems at odds with what's happening onscreen. If it was indeed designed to appeal to a mass audience it clearly failed because it didn't turn out to be a commercial success but the finished product is undeniably entertaining primarily because of its allstar cast and Hoagy Carmichael's songs.Exnightclub singer Linda Rollins Jane Russell reluctantly returns to Las Vegas at the insistence of her wealthy husband Lloyd Vincent Price. He wants to spend a few days at the desert resort and after seeing a telegram from his Boston business associate Monte Linda quickly realises that Lloyd is being pressed by the trustees of his company to return some money to the business and it looks as if he's planning to do so by winning big at one of the city's casinos. To this end Lloyd gets Linda to flaunt her 150000 necklace at The Fabulous casino but the manager is still only prepared to offer him 10000 credit.Linda's discomfort at returning to her hometown is obvious and after Lloyd encourages her to go ahead and get her past out of her system she visits The Last Chance where she used to work and reminisces briefly about singing with the establishment's pianist Happy Hoagy Carmichael and regularly being watched by a soldier who always sat at the same table. Her romance with the soldier  Dave Andrews Victor Mature had ended when he was posted abroad. She's pleased when she meets Happy again and as they play one of their old numbers together Dave who's now a local police detective walks in and is less than happy to see the woman who he still carries a torch for but who had also ended their relationship so cruelly.After Lloyd uses up all his credit at The Fabulous and is asked to leave he uses Linda's necklace as security to get further credit at The Last Chance with the agreement of its owner Mr Clayton Robert J Wilke. Lloyd's further gambling sessions only lead to more losses and Clayton refusing to extend him any more credit. Things then get worse for Lloyd on the following day when Clayton's dead body is discovered and he becomes the prime suspect.Robert Stevenson's direction is notable for its intelligent use of locations in Las Vegas and the Mojave Desert and also for the skill with which the action sequences are staged. Some of the stunts involved are surprisingly good for a movie of this vintage. A scene in which a helicopter flies through a hangar and another in which Victor Mature is seen jumping to the ground from a great height are particularly impressive and wellshot.Stevenson also contributes to the movie's overall characteristic of exploiting Jane Russell's presence to the full by drawing attention to her looks and physique at every possible opportunity. Examples of this are when she's filmed taking a shower when she stands in a swimsuit on a diving board with the word Fabulous emblazoned on a sign close to her and in the ways in which various other scenes are set up. An example of how the script is used for the same purpose arrives early in the action when Linda is recognised on arrival in Vegas by an old acquaintance. When he mentions that he never forgets a face Lloyd responds by saying that the guy obviously has no eye for figure.Vincent Price always excelled in roles in which he acted as a rogue and his performance in this movie is no exception. Victor Mature and Jane Russell also do well and Hoagy Carmichael's contributions both as an affable character and for the quality of a couple of his songs I Get Along Without You Very Well and My Resistance Is Low adds a great deal of enjoyment and charm to the whole proceedings.".

	schema:reviewBody "The title suggests something nearly epic in its scope a history of the gambling capital of the world an iconic mix of organised crime and flaking glamour bright lights and corruption  the 'Casino' of its day. The subsequent film is much more modest  a tale of petty opportunism and every day failure that frankly could be set almost anywhere in the world. Whatever Happy's opening voiceover tries to convince us of this isn't the Las Vegas Story or the Clark County one. Never mind  'The Philadelphia Story' and 'The Palm Beach Story' had similarly grandiose titles with almost as little to back them up although even their stories of marital strife weren't quite as modest as this one.It's a trifle about a woman with a past caught between a seemingly solid husband beginning to crack under financial difficulties and a bitter ex who refuses to forgive her for walking out on him. The catalyst for the plot is her diamond necklace under observation by an insurance agent and desired by the new owner of the bar she used to work in  subtly named 'The Last Chance'. A later Russell film 'Gentlemen Prefer Blondes' would inform us that 'Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend'  here they're her worst enemy coming between her and all the men in her life. Jewellery was often used as a symbol of women's superficial allure and grasping nature in good old misogynistic Hollywood but here it's the men who care about the ice. Russell suffers their loss with no great complaint.For the most part 'The Las Vegas Story' is no great shakes. Victor Mature gives a real teakandleather performance as the male lead he looks a little like Jerry Orbach but he has all the charisma of a side of sweaty beef and hangs like a dead weight in all the scenes he's in particularly those with Jane Russell. We can understand why she left him  he's an unappealing prospect. There's no real Vegas atmosphere to the film  although the hotel bathroom set is wonderful in its tacky opulence. Most of the direction is perfunctory and the script isn't sharp enough  it clearly aspires to hardboiled banter but doesn't give the actors anything to work with and a subplot about underage newlyweds is truly trite an example of Old Hollywood storytelling at its worst. Despite the script Vincent Price is pretty good segueing from cheerful husband to cold desperate gambler effortlessly but he seems to get lost halfway through the film.Shining out amongst all this mediocrity is Jane Russell probably the most wasted film actress of her time. She displayed natural charisma in front of the camera in her very first film 'The Outlaw' and she visibly grew in confidence as an actress over her next few films but she never really got to work in great films  with the arguable exception of 'Gentlemen Prefer Blondes'. Here she's sublime despite working with thirdrate material. Whilst the script leaves Mature somewhat stranded unable to connect up the various lurches in disposition his character is required to make he suddenly warms up to Russell again for no explicable reason Russell handles these unlikely transitions much better making them seem all of a piece. It's an effortless performance a demonstration of pure filmstar class but just as in 'His Kind of Woman' she's neglected at the climax left standing by as the men slug it out.Fortunately that climax is the salvation of the film. The preceding hour and ten minutes lack either suspense or the kind of brooding menace the Noirish plot seems to require. Once the fleeing villain drives his car into an abandoned Airforce base however the direction picks up considerably. The helicoptercar chase is really well done with impressive stunt flying as the helicopter flies through an open hangar Bondstyle it's so good they repeat the trick a minute later. Even better is the final foot chase around the deserted buildings with brilliantly atmospheric use of the howling wind. Tellingly this is all achieved wordlessly and seems to come from some infinitely superior thriller the purely visual storytelling is reminiscent of Hitchcock. Here the film actually touches greatness if only for a few minutes.The other pleasures are incidental. Like many films of the period it includes a couple of musical numbers totally unnecessary but here rather well done the first as a piano tune triggers a memory in Russell of her time as a singer actually has more emotional impact than any of the dialogue scenes. The murder mystery isn't that mysterious but the solution is pleasingly unconventional it's the opportunistic robbery that is always disproved early on in other whodunits and the film wrongfoots the audience by not discounting Russell as a suspect.Even among the relatively few films that Russell made this is minor nevertheless it does confirm that she was a capable actress not the inflatable doll some critics would like us to remember her as  and is worth seeing for that reason.".

The movie has a somewhat interesting back story about Price and a ruined business partner in Boston. As well there is another back story about Russell and Las Vegas detective Victor Mature who seem to have met a while ago when she was a singer at a casino where Hoagy Carmichael is the long time pianist and band leader. He Carmichael does a great number about a little over halfway through the film that must be seen. As well Russell is wearing a super expensive diamond bracelet that is the object of an aggressive insurance investigator. For my money Price Carmichael and the vintage Vegas scenes are the only really compelling reasons to watch except for a decent chase between a helicopter and a Mercury woody across the desert which leads to an interesting fight in an abandoned military base.".

A stock brokerinvestor Rollins has been embezzling his clients for some time and now needs money desperately to repay them or end up behind bars. Getting 100000.00 in credit from the Fabulous CasinoHotel management Rollins blows it all on the craptable before the night is over. Meanwhile Linda runs into an old flame Dave Andrews Victor Mature who she left when he was sent to the Pacifice during WWII.Dave to Linda's surprise and regret is not only living in Vages where she met him when she was a singer at The Last Chance casino but he's an officer in the Las Vegas police Dept and in charge of the Vegas Strip where the casinos are located. Both Linda and Dave are at odds with each others when they first meet. Dave feeling that he was let down by Linda for not coming back to him after the war and Linda a bit taken up by Dave's obsession with her that doesn't seem to have ended now some ten years after they last saw each others. Meanwhile Linda's husband Llyod hocks her 50000.00 diamond necklace for a measly 10000.00 to continue gambling this time in the Last Chance casino to it's owner Clyton Robert J. Wilke. Unknow to both the Rollins' their being tailed by insurance instigator Tom Hubler Brad Dexter. Who's job it is to make sure that Linda's necklace is safe and sound being that it's insured for 150000.00 by the company that he works for.All these stories come together when Clyton is later found murdered at the his place with the casino's daily cash profits missing. The murder of Clyton has Llyod Rollins name all over it with him needing money which Clyton refused to advance himto keep on gambling to make up what he already lost plus the money he stole from his investors. Standard 1950's policedrama thats really uplifted a few notches with an incredible helicoptercar chase in the Navada desert as Dave and the pilot Tobey Riggs corner Clyton's killer in a restricted US Military base could that have been what later became known as area 51? After the killer shot and wounded Tobey Dave chases him on to an army watchtower where after knocking him down Dave shoots the fugitive as he tries to go for his gun as he falls to his death. There was a nice little subplot in The Las Vages Story involving two young wouldbe newlyweds Bill  Mary Chester Marshall  Colleen Miller. Mary's dad Ray Walkers didn't want them to get married because his daughter was under age and refused to give her his consent. Bill about to be drafted in the Army and Mary having to wait for him to serve out his two years was a mirror image of what happened between Dave and Linda ten years earlier. In this case the ending was a lot more cheerier Dave talked Mary's father into letting the two lovebirds tie the knot.".

It is saved however by the RKO production values the studio above any other gave the genre its quintessential look and the star cast which also includes Victor Mature Hoagy Carmichael Brad Dexter and Jay C.

In the meantime she has married wealthy Price but does not know he is close to bankruptcy before noticing a wire he received reporting the suicide of his Boston colleague! another old acquaintance is coponthebeat Mature bitter at her apparent desertion of him. Needless to say Russell and Mature ultimately get to rekindle their affair but the path runs far from smoothly apart from their own mutual resentment Price does not look favourably upon his wife's former conquests while complicating things further is the expensive necklace Price uses as a guarantee in order to try his luck at one of the leading casinos which is being closely watched by insurance investigator Dexter. Eventually the new owner of Russell's old haunt is found murdered after he had denied Price further credit and the necklace stolen. Of course Price becomes the key suspect  and Russell accuses Mature of having framed him so as to get back at her! However it is obvious from the getgo that the real culprit is the wolfish Dexter and the film climaxes decently with a desert helicopter chase and a shootout in an abandoned hangar. As for Price he is ready to pay the price sic of his own criminal activity back home i.e. embezzlement.The film is reasonably enjoyable with most of the expected noir elements intact  including its fair share of hardboiled dialogue not to mention having Russell and Carmichael warble a number of songs  but the contrived scripting by Earl Felton and Harry Essex who ought to have known better! cornball attempts at comedy mainly having to do with Sheriff Flippen betting what Mature's next move will be with respect to both solving the case and sorting out his private life! and an incongruous sentimental streak clearly evoking CASABLANCA 1942 in the subplot involving a couple of underage elopers! prevent the promising mixture from rising to greater heights.".

Now Russell's visiting Vegas with her wheelerdealer husband Price. Meanwhile Mature has become a lieutenant on the Vegas police force. So what's going to happen when the former lovers meet as they must especially when a valuable necklace disappears and a casino murder complicate things.The movie promotes Vegas's strip at a time when the town was emerging as a gamblingvacation center. The following year 1953 Sinatra would reinvent his career by connecting the Nevada town with glamorous Hollywood entertainers. And the rest as they say is history. Anyway I expect this flick was one of the first to bring the strip to small town America.And who better to draw in movie audiences than two of Hollywood's most physical specimens the broadshouldered Mature and the buxom Russell though her attributes are downplayed here. At the time Mature was an established star while Russell's career was beginning to take off especially with the following year's Gentlemen Prefer Blondes 1953.I doubt however that this rather bland narrative advanced either career. Coming from Howard Hughes' RKO and his wellknown fascination with Vegas I imagine contract player Russell had little choice. Anyway the wryly entertaining Hoagy Carmichael injects some atmosphere along with a slicked up Robert Wilke in a departure from his usual thuggish roles. Too bad however that we don't see more of the great Vincent Price who injects both spirit and style into the proceedings. Nonetheless catch that swooping copter chase that I'm sure thrilled audiences of the time and still does.All in all it looks like the movie was built around Hughes's sharp eye for Vegas's emerging glitz. At the same time the two leads furnish audience comeons. Too bad the story itself comes across more like a pedestrian afterthought.".

The film's plot mostly hinges on a murder mystery that's barely interesting. Some of the best scenes are between Russell and her old piano player Hoagy Carmichael. The Las Vegas Story was produced by Howard Hughes at RKO who famously produced Russell's scandalous western The Outlaw and was directed by journeyman director Robert Stevenson who later directed a number of pictures at Disney including classics like Mary Poppins and Bedknobs and Broomsticks to lesser Disney fare like The GnomeMobile and In Search of the Castaways so it shouldn't come as too much of a surprise that this film lacked any real creative spark. I was hoping to see lots of period footage of 1950s Vegas but it's all sets and stock footage so this film doesn't even offer a vintage travelogue appeal. Besides Russell Dexter is quite good as the steely eyed villain. I've never understood the appeal of Victor Mature as a lead actor but he's serviceable in his part. Overall The Last Vegas Story does offer an exciting climax involving a helicopter chasing a car and a shootout at an airport hanger but other than that it's all quite bland outside of the never bland Ms. Russell.".

	schema:headline " Jane Russell's glamour raises it above the mundane";
	schema:reviewBody "The title The Las Vegas Story might suggest a film recounting the city's history possibly centred upon the early days of the gaming industry under Bugsy Siegel and Meyer Lansky. It is not however a movie of that sort any more than The Philadelphia Story deals with the early days of colonial Pennsylvania. It is sometimes classed as a film noir although to my mind that term is sometimes overused to describe virtually any crime drama made between 1930 and 1960. Certainly The Las Vegas Story lacks some of the characteristics of classic noir such as lowkey lighting and a sense of moral ambivalence.A wealthy stockbroker named Lloyd Rollins arrives in Las Vegas to play the tables. Accompanying him is his beautiful and much younger wife Linda who used to work as a singer in one of the city's casinos. Linda meets her former boyfriend Dave Andrews whom she knew before her marriage and who is now working as a local police officer. I won't recount the plot in any more detail as it gets very complicated something to do with a valuable diamond necklace an insurance fraud a suspicious investigator and the murder of a casino owner.In many ways this is a fairly standard early fifties crime drama with little in terms of its plot that would make it stand out from dozens of others. There are however a few features which make the film just about worth seeing even today. There is a very good suspense sequence when Dave pursues the villain into the Nevada desert involving a chase between a helicopter and a car and a cliffhanger in an abandoned military base. Like another viewer I was reminded by this sequence of the work of Alfred Hitchcock and wondered if it could have served as an inspiration for the famous cropduster scene in North by NorthWest.The leading man Victor Mature as Dave gives a rather static wooden performance he tended to be better in historical dramas in which his impressive physique and screen presence made him stand out. Vincent Price however is better as Lloyd a smoothly plausible rogue with a few skeletons in his cupboard and there is an entertaining cameo from Hoagy Carmichael better known as a songwriter and musician as Happy the eccentric pianist in the casino bar. The name Happy is presumably an ironic nickname as he has a permanently mournful expression on his face.The best thing about the film however is the presence of the lovely Jane Russell. Jane's time at the top was a relatively short one which is not surprising given that she was that rare breed a thirtysomething sex symbol. She only made three films while in her twenties but another sixteen between the ages of 30 and 36 following which she retired from the screen although she did make occasional comebacks. In the fifties a fortysomething sex symbol was evidently regarded as a contradiction in terms although Joan Collins was to reinvent herself as precisely that in the seventies. There is an interesting comparison between Jane and her contemporary Veronica Lake Lake's career was effectively over by 1949 whereas Russell's did really not take off until 1951 even though she was actually the older of the two by eighteen months.Jane was perhaps not the most technically brilliant actress in Hollywood but she had a compelling screen presence and although she may not have made any great films she made some very watchable and entertaining ones. She also had a very good singing voice which she puts to good use in this movie singing among other things the wellknown hit My Resistance Is Low. Following her temporary retirement from the cinema in 1957 she was to reinvent herself as a Las Vegas nightclub singer like her character Linda. It is her glamour by which I mean her charisma and presence as well as her physical attractiveness which is responsible for raising The Las Vegas Story above the level of the mundane. 610".

You could feel their heat radiating every time they appeared together. You could see their eyes shooting daggers at each other. There was no denying their passion.The story isn't the greatest but it's interesting enough and kept the surprises to the end. Quite a bit is thrown into it drama romance murder and more so it covers quite a few categories. There's some sleaze too like when the insurance guy leers at Jane Russell's magnificent dcollet. I guess Howard Hughes just couldn't help himself. Yet Ms Russell is such a class act that her physical attributes are just icing on the cake.There's also some nifty action scenes that I thought played out quite well especially the desert sequence starting with the helicopter chase scene and ending with the air control tower. The whole thing had the feel of authenticity to it unlike the cgi stuff we're spoon fed today. These were real people working their craft performing for the audience and one hopes having fun at it.

The Invisible Man is fraught with witty dialogue excellent character acting inventive and creative special effects insightful direction and solid tight scripting.  The story is about a scientist that develops a serum which turns himself invisible for good intent initially.  The serum has negative side effects one of which is turning the scientist into a ravingmad megalomaniac bent on conquering mankind and the world.  What is most surprising about the film is its rather perverse sense of black humoura James Whale specialty and its cruelty. The Invisible Man is not a benign horror monster but rather a frightening destructive force capable of acts of violence madness and viciousness. The direction is the real star of the film as Whale combines script acting mood and setting amidst the background of groundbreaking special effects that are still impressive to this day.  Whale laces his special humour throughout and this film has no shortage of dark comedic moments.  The acting all around is very good with people like Henry Travers Gloria Stuart Una O'Connor and William Harrigan especially as a jealous doctor giving all the support they can to a formless Claude Rains.  Rains's voice is magnificent and one senses he was made to play the part that would make him famous.  Look for Dwight Frye in a small role.  A wonderful film experience!".

But Claude Rains was made as of that moment though it would be awhile before he actually ceased being a villain in all of his films. James Whale's THE INVISIBLE MAN is possibly the best of the early Universal horror series of the 1930s. FRANKENSTEIN and Dracula both English and Spanish versions are great films too but the threat of Jack Griffin's discovery of invisibility makes the other two seem quaint as threats. One can run from Frankenstein and one can stay indoors at night with a handy cross or garlic available. But how does one fully protect oneself against someone who is physically strong mentally smart and totally determined to kill you if you cannot see him? It's not easy especially if the goal of this monster is to rule over others. As he puts it he wishes to have the world grovel at his feet.In the novel Griffin's personality is shown to be so selfish from the start that one can tell that no matter what discovery he would have made he would have misused it for power. He has no redeeming features at all. However his omnipotence is sort of curbed in one way that is not the case in the film. A character is invented by Wells who is not in the movie that Griffin frightens into serving as a slave or servant. The character manages to run off with Griffin's chemistry lab and chemicals as well as Griffin's notebooks. As a result he is trapped in his invisibility and can't get out of this situation until the novel ends.The film does have some classic moments of humor Whale liked to add black humor to his films.

	schema:reviewBody "James Whale is for good reason most famous for his Frankenstein films. However better than both albeit marginally is this film  The Invisible Man. When I first saw this I couldn't believe that it's over seventy years old and upon a second viewing the film just gets better and better. Considering the time in which it was made The Invisible Man is one of the most amazing films of all time. The special effects are what really make the film. CGI has pretty much spoilt this sort of reaction to a movie. The Invisible Man really has that 'how did they do it?' feel which movie audiences of yesteryear so often enjoyed and it's done such a good job with it that I'm still wondering today. The plot gives way to lots of trickery and visual magic as it follows a mad scientist who has turned himself invisible. However things aren't so simple because one of the drugs he used has properties that can turn a man insane and this side of the drug has had a huge effect on our man. Believing he can take over the world he recruits the help of one of his fellow scientists and sets about a reign of invisible terror.You would think that it would be hard to convince an audience that one of your characters is invisible but Whale makes it look easy! Claude Rains spends much of the film either under the cover of bandages or not even in it but it doesn't matter because it's not him but his voice that makes the performance. The fiendishness of his voice is compelling and pure evil and I don't believe that there is a better man in existence for this role. There isn't a lot of physical acting for him to do but this is made up for with a dazzling array of special effects. We get to see a shirt move on it's own things fly around rooms and havoc is caused. It really shows Whale's genius to pull this off. Whale is best known as a horror director but it's obvious that he has a great respect for comedy also as his Frankenstein films were very tongueincheek and so is this film. The scenes that see the invisible man causing mayhem are hilarious and will delight anyone who sees the film. Whale's ability to entertain is absolute and that is why the films he made for the studio were always the biggest successes. The Invisible Man is one of the greatest achievements in cinema history and anyone who tells you otherwise is wrong!".

It has a number of strengths but it benefits most of all from James Whale's direction creativity and technical excellence. Both the flashier aspects of the movie such as the invisibility effects and also most of the basic elements are done with skill.The story is for the most part based on the one main idea of The Invisible Man who combines his scientific genius with a generous supply of madness. The story is interesting enough in itself and of course it provides all kinds of opportunities for visual tricks. Whale hits just the right balance in making good use of these opportunities without overindulging himself.The visual effects themselves are of excellent quality and they are far better than all but the very best of the presentday computer imagery. While it is usually rather easy to spot which parts of a movie are computergenerated Whale's effects are all but seamless with the exception of a handful of brief moments. They are often quite impressive without resorting to tired devices such as explosions and the like in order to impress those with shorter attention spans.Claude Rains does quite well for having such limitations on what he could do. The rest of the cast is solid if mostly unspectacular letting the story do the work. Una O'Connor somewhat overdoes it with the screaming this time but otherwise the characters are believable. The acting may seem slightly quaint to those who are accustomed to the pretentious styles of the present generation of performers but it's certainly better than the grating selfimportant performances in some of the recent movies of the same genre.While the story does not have the thematic depth or the suggestive imagery of horror classics like Frankenstein or Dracula this adaptation gets everything it can out of the material telling the story in an entertaining fashion and with technical skill.".

He enters a hostelry called The Lions Head the patrons of the bar fall silent for the man is bound in bandages. He tells not asks the landlady I want a room with a fire. This man is Dr. Jack Griffin soon to wreak havoc and be known as The Invisible Man.One of the leading lights of the Universal Monster collection of films that terrified and enthralled audiences back in the day. Directed by genre master James Whale The Invisible Man is a slick fusion of dark humour berserker science and genuine evil. Quite a feat for a film released in 1933 even more so when one samples the effects used in the piece. Effects that are still today holding up so well they put to shame some of the toy like expensive tricks used by the modern wave of film makers. John P. Fulton take a bow sir.After Boris Karloff had turned down the chance to play the good doctor gone crazy on account of the role calling for voice work throughout the film except a snippet at the finale Whale turned to Claude Rains. Small in stature but silky in voice Rains clearly sensed an opportunity to launch himself into Hollywood. It may well be with Whale's expert guidance of course that he owes his whole career to that 30 second appearance of his face at the end of the film? As was his want Whale filled out the support cast with odd ball eccentrics acted adroitly by the British  Irish thespians. Una O'Connor Forrester Harvey Edward E.

Based on the now famous story written by H.G. Wells Whale and R. C. Sheriff's writer version remains the definitive Invisible Man adaptation. There's some changes such as the time it is set and Griffin is not the lunatic he is in the film which is something that Wells was not too pleased about in spite of liking the film as a whole but it's still tight to the source.Sequels TV series and other modern day adaptations would follow it but none are as shrewd or as chilling as Whale's daddy is. 910".

He enters a hostelry called The Lions Head the patrons of the bar fall silent for the man is bound in bandages. He tells not asks the landlady I want a room with a fire. This man is Dr. Jack Griffin soon to wreak havoc and be known as The Invisible Man.One of the leading lights of the Universal Monster collection of films that terrified and enthralled audiences back in the day. Directed by genre master James Whale The Invisible Man is a slick fusion of dark humour berserker science and genuine evil. Quite a feat for a film released in 1933 even more so when one samples the effects used in the piece. Effects that are still today holding up so well they put to shame some of the toy like expensive tricks used by the modern wave of film makers. John P. Fulton take a bow sir.After Boris Karloff had turned down the chance to play the good doctor gone crazy on account of the role calling for voice work throughout the film except a snippet at the finale Whale turned to Claude Rains. Small in stature but silky in voice Rains clearly sensed an opportunity to launch himself into Hollywood. It may well be with Whale's expert guidance of course that he owes his whole career to that 30 second appearance of his face at the end of the film? As was his want Whale filled out the support cast with odd ball eccentrics acted adroitly by the British  Irish thespians. Una O'Connor Forrester Harvey Edward E. Clive and Henry Travers are memorable. While American Gloria Stuart as the power insane Griffin's love interest is radiant with what little she has to do.

	schema:reviewBody "Claude Rains. The man. The myth. The legend. You cannot talk about this film whether in conversation or in any review without placing this actor on the tip of your tongue. He is the epitome of the madness that surrounded the powerhungry Invisible Man. In this day of modern cinematic wonder most fullfledged actors would want their faces to be in front of the camera showcasing the entire film. Directors would want this fledgling star to promote their film get kiddies interested in spending their money and for financiers to see the profits of their contributions. Let's face it if Brad Pitt is in a movie typically most audience members are actually going to see Brad Pitt. Thankfully we have directors like James Whale and his interpretation of H.G.Wells' classic The Invisible Man. Whale took a powerful story expanded it breathed life into it and followed up with quite possibly one of the most sinister villains in movie horror history since Hannibal Lector. He is crude he is heartless and he wants nothing more than world domination  he is Claude Rains  and yet until the end of the film we never see the white's of his eyes.There are several reasons why I just fell in love with this film outside of the cataclysmic performance of Claude Rains. Ohhhh Claude Rains. I loved the way that this movie was filmed. I loved the scope of the Invisible Man's terror. Whale could have kept his antagonist to committing just single murders of friends and family he could of just kept it confined to just one single town he could have kept our focus directly on the turmoil of Rains but instead he decided amazingly! to open the entire can of worms with success. When I first began this film I was expecting the classic images of angry villagers with pitchforks storming the house that the Invisible Man lived within but instead Whale gave us this sort of random chaos that truly created fear around this character. Whale is able to give us the true terror of this madman by perhaps expanding his budget and showing us how big the terror of the Invisible Man is. For example I never foresaw the horrific train accident nor the random worker push off the mountain and when Rains explained to Kemp what the human impact of falling down a ravine would be like it literally sent shivers down my spine. Whale created a madman better than some modern horror films could ever accomplish.For a film created in the 1930s the special effects were spectacular. Sure CGI was just a glimmer in Lucas' mother's eyes but James Whale did a superb job of giving us these rare glimpses into the future of special effects. The way that he created the Invisible Man surprised me. I did not expect to ever see the creature without his bandages on but within ten minutes we are shown the full scope of Whale's creativity. I thought the use of snow dust and even the early stages of the overused green screen was original for its time. To see Rains smoke as the Invisible Man put a smile on my face. This is a perfect example of a film that used just enough special effects in the right way to make the audience forget for a brief time that this was in fact a film  not real life. While the special effects did have one or two flaws see the Invisible Man riding the stolen bike  were those wires? I must credit Whale for pushing the envelope for the time. It was surprising to see such quality from such an older film.If there would be anything that I would change about this film would be the subtext concerning the relationship between Rains and Flora played by Titanic star Gloria Stuart. I thought this was nearly unnecessary. I understand the value of trying to give a human element to this monster but I thought that it could have been done without these random scenes. There wasn't really any connection between the two and we were left with very little information of them prior to the start of the film. Perhaps if there had been a stronger prestory it would have congealed better. The same can be said for the chemistry and reasonings for the plot points surrounding Rains and Kemp. I could understand why they occurred during the film but there had to be something more prior to the opening scene. I wanted to know more. I think that is a good sign for a film when you are left wondering what was the story before this one  and even what was it afterwards.Overall I thought this was an exceptional film. I now have this newfound respect for Claude Rains a man I knew nothing about prior to watching this film. He carried this film and honestly successfully pulled off one of the most frightening madmen this world has ever seen. I think what scared me the most about him was the fact that he actually unlike some villains actually followed through with his vile plans. He was evil whether the invisibility did it or not he was pure evil and I loved every minute of it. The special effects were delightful with a small subplot that this picture could have gone without. Amazing and a perfect treat before Halloween! Grade  out of ".

Of course it's quite amazing that these computers are so advanced but that leaves the honour to some computerpeople  not to the director and special effects crew. No it's these oldies that really have the effects simply because they had to be creative. In The invisible man and several others like King Kong from 1931 I think I can't do anything but letting the technical masterpiece fill me with awe.To take the second thing secondly Claude Rains was or so they say really a rather bad actor who was taken because of his voice and a great voice it is! I can't describe it you have to hear it. I just wonder where that voice has gone in his other films... By the way is he the only one acting really naturally in this movie which is from a time where every actor had been taken from the stage.Oh I almost forgot The humour is several places really good. I do still months later see a couple of dancing trousers for my inner eye to the song Here we go gathering nuts in May nuts in May nuts in May... One of the funniest scenes I've ever seen!Of course it has its flaws mainly in the acting but considering that it is so old and so cool it gets nine out of ten stars something I give very very rarely.".

The term gets thrown around so much that it often looses some of its importance and real meaning. I try to reserve classic to a select group of films that I believe have achieved a certain status and have withstood the test of time. And I have no problem putting the label classic on The Invisible Man.James Whale made a lot of great films in the 1930s. Some Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein for example may be better known but I've always thought of The Invisible Man as the best of the bunch. It's got everything. Terrific performances incredible special effects nice comedic touches and technical brilliance are found in abundance throughout the film.Terrific Performances For someone who only has a few seconds of actual screen time Claude Rains is amazing. His voice creates such a presence that at times it's easy to forget that he's not actually there. As for Una O'Connor I've seen some people complain about Whale's use of her but I think she was never better than in The Invisible Man. She's great whether playing the proper landlord showing a new guest to his room or as the overly hysterical woman afraid for her life. The rest of the cast especially E.E. Clive and Gloria Stuart is exceptional.Incredible Special Effects It's amazing to revisit The Invisible Man and see how well the special effects have withstood the passage of time. They were stateoftheart in 1933 and they remain impressive today. It took some real craftsmanship to pulloff the invisibility gags seen in The Invisible Man. To me none is more impressive than the first time we get a glimpse under the bandages while he's eating and we see no lower jaw. Impressive stuff! Nice Comedic Touches Billed as a horror film The Invisible Man actually contains more scenes of humor than horror. I've already mentioned O'Connor but she's only a small part of the humor in the film. The police the various frightened passersby and even Claude Rains himself add to the fun found in The Invisible Man. I'm of the opinion that it never goes overboard but fits nicely into the plot.Technical Brilliance Beyond the special effects the film is wonderful from a technical standpoint. Lighting cinematography and set design are incredible and some of the best of the 30s. Everything looks perfect. In my opinion Whale never did better. I've always been impressed by the way Whale used his camera as part of the action when many of his contemporaries seemed content with the plant it and shoot style of filmmaking.The only negative aspect of the film that I can possibly complain about is William Harrigan in the role of Rains' rival Dr. Arthur Kemp. He's just not as good as those around him. Other than that little quibble I've got nothing to complain about. I believe it should be easy to see why I for one consider The Invisible Man a classic!".

It also marks the debut of the respected character actor Claude Rains in the lead role.The film opens with a mysterious figure coming to a country inn during a winter storm seeking food and shelter. The mysterious figure is Dr. John Griffin Rains who is wrapped up in bandages and explains this as having been involved in a terrible accident. Actually through experiments he had made himself invisible and is searching for the antidote. Griffin asks the innkeeper's wife Jenny Hall Una O'Connor in another of those delightful screaming British hag roles that he wishes not to be disturbed. Of course poor Jenny opens the door at the wrong moment and discovers Griffin's secret. Mayhem ensues.Unknown to Griffin there is a serious side effect to his condition...gradual madness. His mentor Dr. Cranley Henry Travers and his daughter Flora Gloria Stuart are very concerned for him. Griffen flees the inn killing a policeman in the process and goes to the house of his colleague Dr. Kemp William Harrigan.Griffen by now driven mad forces Kemp to assist him in his evil deeds. Several more murders take place until the invisible man is eventually brought to justice.Claude Rains launched a distinguished and lengthy career with this film. Oddly enough we don't see his face until the end of the picture as his character is invisible throughout. Harrigan is good as the beleaguered colleague and O'Connor as previously mentioned is a hoot. Travers and Stuart have little to do except look concerned over the fate of the tragic Griffin.Watch for Walter Brennan as the owner of a bicycle John Carradine as a caller offering a tip to police and the talented but under utilized Dwight Frye as a reporter.A true classic of this or any genre.".

Whale's direction and Sheriff's script compliment each other perfectly. Rains just a voice until the end in his US film debut is just perfectly cast lending such an eerie presence. The rest of the cast is good with O'Connor standing and screaming out as the innkeeper's wife.

It's a lot smarter than the likes of Dracula or Frankenstein though still doesn't quite reach Bride of Frankenstein's standard and a lot funnier.

	schema:reviewBody "The Invisible Man may be James Whale's best mainstream film. It's more fantasy than horror and shows the director more at ease with his material and less likely to make light of it than usual. Coming not too long after his initial success with Frankenstein but before the campy disillusion that one already senses in Bride this H.G. Wells adaptation shows that Whale could restrain himself and yet still be himself. It begins beautifully on a snowbound landscape as we see a mysterious figure all bundled up carrying his bags through the snowstorm as he approaches an inn. We can see that he's wearing dark glasses. As he moves closer we can see that his face is swathed in bandages. When he enters the inn all action stops and the place goes silent. The stranger has a presence even before he speaks. There is something commanding about him. He rents a room at the inn but people keep on bothering him as they are curious about who is. And he's certainly peculiar enough he never takes his bandages off. As things develop the man is Griffin a scientist who has been working on an invisibility formula or rather he's found the formula. The problem is what it does to him. Griffin is slowly but surely going mad and becoming increasingly paranoid and grandiose in the bargain. When he takes all his clothes off he is completely invisible which enables him to wreak all kinds of havoc. In short time he's a raving homicidal maniac terrorizing the countryside and bent on world domination. A manhunt ensues. Thanks to a witty R.C. Sherriff script and excellent special effects by John Fulton the movie was and still is a lot of fun. Though the subject matter is fairly serious Whale can't keep a straight face for long and as a result the film is a bit of a romp. There's murder and mayhem aplenty and some very droll humor along the way. Claude Rains speaks the title role authoritatively and has a way with thundering commands which can send a chill up one's spine. The supporting cast isn't as strong as is usual with Whale though Gloria Stuart makes a lovely heroine. Since the film is set in England Whale's eccentricities are more appropriate and fit in nicely with the story. And though the movie was made in Hollywood it's almost as if the director was on his home turf. He handles his improbable material with aplomb and great skill and was at this stage of his career the equal of Hitchcock who was just starting to make a name for himself on the other side of the pond.".

What I especially liked is that even when he does have the bandage on we are never allowed to see his emotions.  That is all dependent on the vocal performance and Rains' crystalclear voice shines through beautifully.  Just check out the scene where he and Gloria Stuart are together in an upper room in the inspector's house.  His voice goes from loving and gentle to near raving mad and it is absolutely chilling.  This film should be a reference point for actors writers and directors as to just how important the voice is in defining a character.

	schema:reviewBody "What can be said about THE INVISIBLE MAN that hasn't already been said? Claude Rains' superlative performance in the title role.  James Whale's imaginative film direction.  John P. Fulton's special effects that still impress today.  The colorful supporting cast particularly Una O'Connor as the landlady Jenny Hall and E.E. Clive as constable Jaffers.  THE INVISIBLE MAN's reputation as a classic is well deserved.It should be further stated that the film considerably improves on the H.G. Wells novel which it is based.  In the novel the titular character Griffin effectively symbolizes the ruthless monomaniac who misuses science for his own personal gain.  But as a character he's onedimensional.  Even though Wells emphasizes his frail humanity as he suffers the disadvantages of invisibility the author never reveals what makes Griffin tick.Screenwriter R.C. Sherriff fleshes out Griffin not only by giving him a first name Jack but by providing him with an identifiable motivation.

Griffin tells her I was so pitifully poor I had nothing to offer you Flora.  I was just a poor struggling chemist.

He transforms from a kind sensitive man to a homicidal megalomaniac.  Consequently he becomes a hunted man alienated from the rest of humanity including Flora.

	onyx:emotionText "What can be said about THE INVISIBLE MAN that hasn't already been said? Claude Rains' superlative performance in the title role.  James Whale's imaginative film direction.  John P. Fulton's special effects that still impress today.  The colorful supporting cast particularly Una O'Connor as the landlady Jenny Hall and E.E. Clive as constable Jaffers.  THE INVISIBLE MAN's reputation as a classic is well deserved.It should be further stated that the film considerably improves on the H.G. Wells novel which it is based.  In the novel the titular character Griffin effectively symbolizes the ruthless monomaniac who misuses science for his own personal gain.  But as a character he's onedimensional.  Even though Wells emphasizes his frail humanity as he suffers the disadvantages of invisibility the author never reveals what makes Griffin tick.Screenwriter R.C. Sherriff fleshes out Griffin not only by giving him a first name Jack but by providing him with an identifiable motivation.  He devises a love interest Flora Cranley Gloria Stuart decades before her performance as Old Rose in TITANIC who is the catalyst for Griffin's fantastic experiment.

And just consider the fact that after killing several men for being thieves these exact same mafia bosses then try and rob Brad Pitt's character of what he is actually financially entitled to from them.The reason both Obama and Bush are heard at different times in the film is because we are meant to realize that this problem is not exclusive to either the left or the right it is about what America as a whole has allowed itself to become as a nation. And also to highlight the fact that both left and right have allowed this problem to persist and grow.Brad Pitt's speech at the end of the film is really the essence of what this film is about  a cynical examination of the death of the American dream and American idealism.I think that in time this film will come to be more highly regarded as a clever piece of commentary on present day America  and when it is viewed in that light rather than as a gangster film it makes much more sense to the viewer.".

It slowed down the pace of dialogue scenes to a relatable and believable level made the violence far more realistic and didn't overdo the music. Those who can't handle too much or too realistic of violence won't like this movie.Some might feel the dialogue makes the movie drag just a bit but if you like realistic filmmaking they've made it feel as if you're sitting in on actual conversations. The scenes and cuts are long but are livened up with the fairly constant scummyness of the characters. James Gandolfini seemed to prattle on a little too much but I suppose that was the point.The violence can be summed up as unsentimental much of it can be defined by the difficult achievement of not falling into played out Hollywood clichs. There are no heros in this movie as the director doesn't use cheap tricks like voiceovers disproportionate screen time or happy music to convince you that one criminal is worth rooting for over the others. There is no glorification or demonization of violence as it is depicted without the influence of music and the audience can decide for themselves about what is being shown. There are no Schwartzeneggerstyle shoot outs as the violence is usually sudden but brutal and loud. Every gunshot is closer to being as loud as real life so you get a little jolt with every shot like being at a gun range.The use of music is also played down and important in making both the violence and dialogue distinct. There is some music which gives the movie some energy but overall far less than the average Hollywood film. This adds an element of suspense as the music doesn't give away what is about to happen in every scene like a movie with ominous music when something bad is about to happen etc.. The lack of music also allows the audience a semblance of neutrality in what they are observing characters are allowed to be likable without being good. This is the sort of movie you could expect if the hero was removed and you only had the villains and thugs left overit is far less boring.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you want to watch Scarface  go watch Scarface. This movie isn't. KTS is a 180 from the majority of crime classics and their many copycats. The factor that clumps most crime genre flicks together is the topdown perspective. For instance in the Departed it was the rats joining up with the heads of their respective sides of the law  Costello and Queenin. The same with Pauli in Goodfellas the Don in Godfather.KTS splits apart because it is a film about crime from the perspective of the prey. The opening shot is a junkie in a cold wet New Orleans wind lost in a whirlwind of trash against harsh white sky. This is the view of hopelessness  its also the familiarity of many postdisaster neighborhoods. These characters absorbed into the criminal underworld not because they are evil but because they haven't many other options and they're too dumb to know the danger they are in. This is the what KTS communicates to us with the background broadcast of the '08 elections and financial meltdown. When bullets fly in this film  you feel it because you feel for the characters which is why having Cogan as its opaque center is so blisteringly effective. He is pragmatic unapologetic and a completely objective lens to see through. He is the balance between the corrupt political overcast and slime at the bottom of the barrel. America isn't a country. It's a business.Cogan is the the cleanup for the corporation. He snips the buds ties up the loose ends. He is the inevitability of the business world.They are all nice guys. The humanization of the characters drains you as one by one they slip into darkness. Cogan's jaws open and you understand that the characters are rats in a labyrinth they are all gears that will eventually be discarded. The soundtrack rhetoric quite fluidly illuminates the movies' greater statement. With all the economic jargon in a pingpong propaganda game there are people sleeping out on the streets  and a hungry dog has to eat. And all the way up the food chain through a shady poker game in the back of some shutdown strip mall to the podium and our new elected president everyone is a hungry dog here. This is a methodical film that takes its time with each individual scene. It plays with time and space slowing down drifting in and out and then exploding. Cogan walks through the sparks and smoke he is our escort in understanding the nature and design of things and he does with an unforgettable composure. The elements of the film  acting cinematography etc adapt to its scope and drive the purpose that the makers sat down and did it. Each end does its job and considering where you end up there's not much room for improvement in any area. Is it the Godfather? No. But its something completely different and for what KTS was intending to accomplish it was excellent. Don't be deterred by the negative reviews but don't go in expecting the recycling of Scorsese and Copella. This a picture of its own kind of its own vision. Let it move you.".

This helps to give a sense that nobody is of any real importance to each other which is true to the nature of most of its characters.If you like your crime movies real you'll love this.

There is that continuous backdrop of Political rambling rhetoric that mirrors the Character's innate ability to speak much and say little.This is an against the grain try at alternative smart Cinema with just enough stylized graphic violence to make it obvious that this has Artistic commentary and not Documentary style Cinema Verite on its mind. Overall it is a well done and interesting kind of sidestep from the usual whizbang editing and shaky Camera stuff that has become so common. This is slow bordering at times on tedious but never a bore. It is well crafted but does not quite reach that level of great Prose transferred to great Film. But it is a good try at a very difficult rarely achieved process that creates the best of this kind of thing.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is a good case to be made at least here in Britain for prosecuting Killing Them Softly under the Trade Descriptions Act. But I for one shan't be on the sideline cheering on the suit. Many I'm sure tuned in  went to the flicks bought the video watched online illegally  after hearing that Brad Pitt is a hitman called in to clear up a mess and they will most probably have been disappointed.Killing The Softly is most certainly not your average gangster flick. It's most telling scene comes right at the end when Pitt the hitman talks to the crooks' lawyer who is there to pay him for for the murders he has committed on behalf of his paymasters. The scene is played out against yet another of those superficially rousing although in fact pretty vacuous Obama speeches long on sentiment but pretty short on anything much else in which he tries to grab the heart of America in order to garner a few more votes. Such soundbites permeate the film. Pitt's character has heard it all before and then some.In the final scene he is accused of cynicism by the crooks' lawyer but in truth  and oddly  he is one the film's most honest characters. He does what he does looks a situation squarely in the eye calls a spade a spade and does what he is asked to do. He doesn't try to justify or excuse his dirty work. The rest of the characters from the two losers who kick off the whole stupid charade on behalf of another loser who thinks he has a clever plan to the sap who is bumped off by Pitt for no very good reason but to keep the gambling punters happy and is paying for a past transgression to the hitman called in from New York who for one reason or another has lost it and is sent packing are more or less living in their own dream world. All have a working explanation none of which however is worth a row of beans. Only Pitt the effective professional killer sees everything clearly.It might though not be as we would like to see the world. Writer and director Andrew Dominik makes the point that most of us seem to be far happier eschewing the violent lethal reality of the killer Pitt and instead prefer to accept the anodyne riskfree nosmoking ginger ale world of Obama and his vacuous rhetoric. Remember it was Obama who gave the green light to the  well murder  of Osama Bin Laden in a foreign country. Whether or not you agree with what he sanctioned and what was done one must wonder exactly how much his liberal principles played in the decision to give that assassination the OK. For whether you think it justified or not a murder it was.In a sense Pitt is just Obama without the liberal veneer he does what he is paid to do  America is business  and is under no illusions as to what he is doing.So be warned yes you'll get lots of tensionbuilding gangster scenes and yes you'll get your guts full of gore if that's what you want and many of course do but Killing The Softly is a million miles away from being the kind of gangster flick you and my son who started watching it with me but gave up halfway through expect. The point it makes  and even 'making a point' will lose it Brownie points with many punters  is not particularly original or profound but for this punter at least Dominik has made a thoroughly entertaining and watchable movie much as he made with The Assassination Of Jesse James... which also starred Brad Pitt.PS. I like and have always like Brad Pitt a very gifted actor his appearance in Inglourious Basterds is nothing but an aberration and is Tarantinos' cockup not his. I should like to seem him demonstrate his talents in a more 'talky stagy' film. I am confident he could do it.".

It is so quiet but you can feel the heat and their anxiety.After seeing this film I noticed that other crime movies are overly bloody loud and frankly overdone with an exception of Reservoir Dogs.

	schema:reviewBody "The idea of film being used as a medium for political themes and  socioeconomic commentary is nothing new even recently with films such  as Wall Street Money Never Sleeps and Margin Call aiming to tackle the  2008 financial crisis. But few films have been as unsubtle as Killing  Them Softly.  Set to the backdrop of the 2008 election the criminal underworld of an  American city has been hit by its own financial crisis after a mob  poker game is robbed by two criminals Scoot McNairy and Ben  Mendelsohn. With no trades or money being moved a mob manager  Richard Jenkins brings in a fixer Jackie Cogan Brad Pitt to solve  the situation. But none of his actions brings back confidence whether  right or wrong.  Writerdirector Andrew Dominik admirably uses a gangster story as a  metaphor for the financial crisis but the handling was atrocious.  Dominik has no faith in his audience to draw these connections and  even worse come away with its own conclusions he opts to spoonfeed  us the cliff notes as we watch.  This is most evident with the constant use of speeches by George W.  Bush and Barack Obama made at time enforcing the parallels Dominik  wanted to make. There are constant references to terminology used at  the time particularly the theme of bringing back confidence to the  world the theme that public perspective is more important than actual  actions and we are reminded that the gangster world's situation is the  same as the financial world's one. This forceful approach does not  allow us to see a natural story.  Killing Them Softly is a very dialoguedriven film that breaks the old  cinematic maxim of show don't tell. We are told that the mob has  turned corporate and that there is a crisis but we do not get to see  it. It would have been more interesting to see mob bosses arguing and  coming up with theories and seeing that gangsters were unwilling to  make any deals in the midst of the crisis. Killing Them Softly ends up  rather dull as a result.  There are some moments that show what Dominik is capable of the  robbery scene was filled with tension and things felt like they would  actually kick off. Whenever violence was used in general it was  incredibly grim and brutal. There is a highly stylised moment when  Cogan commits his first assassination completely played out in slow  motion  a brilliant little sequence. The film hits hardest in these  scenes.  The big saving grace of Killing Them Softly is the acting. There is a  great cast with Pitt Jenkins and James Gandolfini being the biggest  draws. They were committed actors doing the best they could elevating  the dry material provided with excellent delivery and chemistry. Pitt  and McNairy played the most likable and I use that term loosely  characters and were the most welldrawn and conflicted characters in  the film. McNairy was the most human reacting naturally to his  situation and Pitt is able to be coldhearted and professional when he  acts upon his deadly task.  Killing Them Softly is a film that feels its political parallels are  enough of a mask for it to be seen as an intelligential masterpiece  but it feels too demeaning to have everything spelled out like that  which was made worse given the story played second fiddle to these  political parallels. There was potential for a great film if there was  a good rewrite but it ends up being one of biggest disappointments of  2012.".

There are all of these attempts at being artsy and different with editing and cinematography choices but it always distracts from what little story is there. It tries to pretend to be smart by shoving down the elections and the state of America down our throats for a cheap social commentary. Really this is a stupid movie trying to disguise itself as a smart one. I kept checking the time and considering walking out but thought that maybe there would be at least one surprise from this boringly straight forward story. Instead there is an incredibly unsatisfying and abrupt conclusion and you're left sitting for a moment wondering if critics are getting paid off for their praise.

The script acting direction were all superbly done and should be commended. Although the film can be very pessimistic it does have a message one that should resonate in the near future. The whole cast was extremely effective and highly believable. However Brad Pitt is simply terrific and deserves much acclaim that could come to him. Just like The Assassination of Jesse James Pitt plays subtle but yet powerful sociopath and it ripples the film throughout. James Gandolfini Gandolfini is excellent as a boozy broken old assassin. Ray Liotta offers a grotesque reprise of the type of manic gangster he played in his younger years in Goodfellas. Richard Jenkins is solemn as ever as the killer's contact relaying back messages from the Mob and trying to beat Cogan down on prices. All the men here are relentlessly sexist and foulmouthed.Dominik shoots the action in a grimy shallow focus and his screenplay is tough as steel and shot through with pessimistic even black humor. There is no mistaking the fact that Dominik loves his characters letting their dialogue shine uninterrupted.

This is just one example of a constant series of ridiculous conversations that the film is riddled with. Throughout the film they seem to have some sort of political undercurrent in the background between George Bush and Barack O Bama which I couldn't get my head around. Whether Brad Pitt was trying to get across his political views or what was going on is anyone's guess. I have no problem with the acting in this film....what I can't understand is why Prad Pitt and Ray Liotta both accomplished and celebrated actors agreed to do this film.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was so bad I decided to create an IMDb account finally and hopefully save other people from being duped by the positive reviews.Simply put this is a movie that never needed to be made. There is almost no story to it and what little story there is is told in a horribly long and drawn out way. This includes lots of conversations between characters that have absolutely no relevance to the plot among other things. One of the biggest pointless inclusions in this movie is the frequent clips of Bush  Obama credit crunch speeches that are spliced in virtually everywhere in this film. Although the movie is set right around 2008 there's no relevance to the story at all and it's almost like Brad Pitt is trying to make a political point but isn't really clear on what the point is. I'm confident they could've edited this down to a short story and told us the entire story in 10 minutes and it would've been enjoyable. Instead it was 90 minutes of waiting for it to get going. I don't need big action to keep my simple mind entertained but I do like my movies to have a good plot and a sense of movement. Lawless for instance doesn't move incredibly fast but you are glued the whole time. This movie has none of it and I was not surprised at all to see 3 people walk out just over half way through as I was thinking of doing the same thing myself.I really like Brad Pitt and I would struggle to think of a bad movie he's been in up until this one came along. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone even if it's free. I only wish I could have the 90 minutes of my life back.".

Then Jackie Brad Pitt a hitman is called in to figure out who was behind the robbery and to take care of them. KILLING THEM SOFTLY is being called by many a masterpiece and by many others as one of the worst films of the year. I think most people are really going to hate this film because it's just so different from other stuff out there but I'm going to fall somewhere in the middle of the two groups. While I enjoyed the style and the performances at the same time the film just takes way too long to really get to where it's going and there are some other questionable things that I'll comment on in a bit. What I did like about the picture is that it's pretty brutal and ugly in regards to its violence and characters. The film really doesn't show any of the characters in a good light as the good guys are bad and the bad guys are really bad. There's never an attempt to make you connect with these people or enjoy what they're doing. The film also benefits from some wonderful characters actors. Pitt James Gandolfini Richard Jenkins Scoot McNairy Ben Mendlesohn and Ray Liotta all fit their roles nicely and deliver very good performances. This is especially true of Gandolfini and Liotta. The problem with the picture is that it just has way too many moments where things seem to really get dragged out. Another major problem is that the film tries to be too much like Tarantino. The scenes early one with the two thieves talking dirty about a wide variety of objects is just going to remind people of PULP FICTION. The dialogue here offers up some funny stories but it's not good enough to really grab one and bring them into the picture. KILLING THEM SOFTLY certainly has a unique look and feel to it but in the end it adds up to very little. The BushObama bits of dialogue thrown in throughout the movie also add up to a big nothing although I'm guessing the point was that even lowlife criminals have bit hurt by the economy.".

Johnny Amato has the bright idea of robbing it again  people will assume Markie is playing the same trick again and blame him  and engages losers Frankie Scoot McNairy and Russell Ben Mendelsohn to carry out the robbery. The local crime hierarchy who operate by slowmoving committee are fronted by the unnamed character played by Richard Jenkins who engages enforcer Jackie Brad Pitt to investigate and take remedial action as long as it remains within budget. Jackie in turn brings in hitman Mickey James Gandolfini to whack Johnny because he knows Jackie.This film had a terrific cast but it really wasn't very good. The slim story isn't really enough to fill the relatively sparse running time and there are far too many hugely talky sections which seem to be there just to give the actors a chance to act. In particular James Gandolfini's character is absolutely unnecessary and occupies two lengthy dialogue sessions. Gandolfini is very good the character is deeply unpleasant and that part of the film leads nowhere.But there are also other areas where far too much time is taken to achieve not very much  the dialogue between Frankie and Russell where Russell is descending slowly  very slowly  into a narcotic haze for instance.I would not have minded so much if there had been some pace some excitement or even something attractive to look at. But this is a slow tedious drab film with no sympathetic characters and an overexaggerated idea of its own significance. The political commentary might have meant something if you are American I'm not so it just wasted more time. And I would have quite liked an ending. Never mind maybe next time.".

Gandolfini is very good the character is deeply unpleasant and that part of the film leads nowhere.But there are also other areas where far too much time is taken to achieve not very much  the dialogue between Frankie and Russell where Russell is descending slowly  very slowly  into a narcotic haze for instance.I would not have minded so much if there had been some pace some excitement or even something attractive to look at. But this is a slow tedious drab film with no sympathetic characters and an overexaggerated idea of its own significance. The political commentary might have meant something if you are American I'm not so it just wasted more time. And I would have quite liked an ending. Never mind maybe next time.";

	schema:reviewBody "Every now and again a movie comes along that comes as close to movie perfection as you can get.Killing Them Softly is about the GFC hitting the US criminal underworld. Funds for hits are trickier to obtain. The quality of hitman you can get for your dollar these days is a compromise.Andrew Dominik has taken a great story retitled it with one of its key phrases and given us a movie that will undoubtedly score him a Best Director Oscar nomination in 2013.From the opening sequence with Ben Mendelsohn playing what might be his greatest grottiest character ever the subtext of the film is evoked by great visuals of suburban desolation and regular punctuation of radio and TV political rhetoric. Obama is a frequent image  the official Big Boss of the Ununited States Of America.And without giving anything away no spoilers here it all makes even more sense in the final scene  when text and subtext collide in a gob smacking grim realization of what the US has become and what has become of us. As Michael Moore pointed out in Capitalism A Love Story the distinction between capitalism and democracy has been made murky when they are in fact two very different entities.Democracy is a form of government of the people by the people and for the people. Consensus and referendum are key to policy formation and decisions.Capitalism is based upon 'every man for himself' and for a minimum wage the rest of us can put ourselves into voluntary slavery and subscribe to a generic superstition like say Christianity then buy into the dangled carrot of a better life in the next life. They might call it the After Life but it's really no more than an After Death. And I'm betting not much happens from that point on. Ask a steak that was once a cow what its After Life is like.Capitalism pretended to be the good buddy of democracy in order to establish itself as the preferred First World Westernized way to live. When in fact capitalism has little to do with freedom of the people  unless you are one of the few at the top raking in obscene amounts of money you can't spend and fiddling with yourself on your mansion rooftop watching the rest of the country burn because of your unbridled greed.It's great to see Ben Mendelsohn go from an AFI Best Actor Award for Animal Kingdom  to a significant support role in The Dark Knight Rises  to a perfectly directed role in Killing Them Softly that will establish him as an internationally recognised character actor. And he's worth every accolade he gets.In my interview with Andrew Dominick I complimented him on his heavy use of closeups on his cast which creates extreme intimacy. In scenes of James Gandolfini with Brad Pitt in a hotel room you can see the direction of dialogue coming out of Gandolfini's mouth and also the expert direction of his character's soul being directed in the facial muscles tics and the old wounded eyes of a weary hitman.I'd give Andrew Dominik a Best Directing Oscar nomination for this scene sequence alone. And I'll bet Gandolfini will get a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nod too next year.Also  the Scorseseinfluenced slomo car death sequence cut to music truly elevates the art of dying on celluloid to a new level to which Quentin Tarantino can only aspire. And I really like QT's work with death.Andrew Dominik made Chopper starring Eric Bana then The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford and now Killing Them Softly. He's made a massive impact with three films.The Decline Of The American Empire has happened as surely as did the Decline Of The Roman Empire. There's so much in each frame of Killing Them Softly repeat viewings are essential. It is probably the best film I have seen all year.".

	schema:headline " Cagney  Man Of A Thousand Parts";
	schema:reviewBody "MAN OF A THOUSAND FACES is one of Hollywood's better films about Hollywood! Produced by Universal International in 1957 it recounts the life and times of one of the silent screens most formidable icons  Lon Chaney. From an excellent Oscar nominated screenplay by R.Wright Cambell Ben Roberts and Ivan Goff it was skillfully directed by Joseph Pevney. Peveny himself a useful supporting player in such movies as Body And Soul 1947 and Fox's Street With No Name 1948 directed some of Universal's biggest productions i.e. Away All Boats 1956 Tammy  The Bachelor 1957 and one of Erroll Flynn's last efforts Istanbul 1957. Playing the leading role in this marvellous biopic is James Cagney who gives an outstanding measured performance as Lon Chaney the strange tortured character actor of silent pictures who ironically died from throat cancer with the advent of the talkies.Crisply photographed in black  white Cinemascope by the great Russell Metty Touch Of Evil the picture conveys a strong sense of time and place. Expertly evoked is Vaudeville in the early part of the 20th Century where Chaney began as a song and dance man Cagney delighting us with his special brand of hoofing and early Hollywood where he became an extra at Universal Studios. Then with the help of his makeup box and his uncanny facility to alter his appearance  sometimes resulting in great pain  he soon became known as The Man Of A 1000 Faces.Notable reconstructions of Chaney's creations are quite brilliantly achieved in the picture. Cagney excels as the cripple being cured in a reworking of Chaney's famous scene from The Miracle Man 1919and the phantom being unmasked in Phantom Of The Opera 1925. But especially noteworthy is a restaging of Chaney's The Hunchback Of Notre Dame 1923. Here Cagney is totally unrecognizable as he replicates Chaney's interpretation of Quasimodo being whipped on the punishment wheel in the village square. It is an intense moment in the picture and a remarkable achievement for Cagney the consummate actor! Little wonder that the great Orson Welles in the seventies declared that the screen's greatest actor was James Cagney!Others in the cast of this splendid film are Dorothy Malone giving an excellent performance as the singer and Chaney's first wife Cleva Creighton Jane Greer as his second wife Jim Backus as his press agent and Robert Evens as the boy wonder of the motion picture business Irving Thalberg.The picture also boasts a terrific music score by the underrated and now wholly forgotten film composer Frank Skinner 18971968. Skinner was composer in residence at Universal for many years and composed the music for some of their most prestigious productions such as Tap Roots 1948 Magnificent Obsession 1954 Madame X 1965 and Shenandoah 1965. Man Of A 1000 Faces was however his finest achievement! A soundtrack album of his music from the film  issued at the time of the picture's release  is now a much sought after recording!A wonderful movie on DVD presented in a sharp black  white widescreen format that every collector will want to own if only for Cagney's amazing performance. His Lon Chaney is just as powerful and just as memorable as his George M. Cohan Cody Jarret or Marty The Gimp Snyder!".

James Cagney.... what a talent he was...  this is a fine film bio of another screen great Lon Chaney Sr... Cagney is wonderful and gives a tour de force performance... why he wasn't Oscar nominated for this I'll never Know???? I do not know how accurate a film bio this is... but its entertaining and moving..

	schema:reviewBody "As biopics go this 1957 film shows limited interest today. The legendary figure of Lon Chaney is examined by the same Hollywood where he went to make a legend out of his life. He was a giant in the world of silent films because of the disguises he created for the movies during his second career in the industry. Chaney was a man way ahead of himself as far as the creation of the special type of makeup he used for all the different characters he played.Lon Chaney's roots were in vaudeville where he also was greatly admired. However his lucky break came not in the theater but in the new industry of the moving pictures that was starting in California. Mr. Chaney was able to bring something new to those pictures that sparked the imagination of audiences in the many films he starred in. His association with the legendary Irving Thalberg helped cement his own status in the movie business.His personal life though was not a happy one. His first wife the beautiful Cleva Creighton showed she did not care from him and abandoned Lon and her young son without a second thought. Chaney received a big blow in the custody of the young son Creighton who was placed in an orphanage because he couldn't show means of support for the child. Being separated from his son Creighton was a big blow to the man who adored the young boy but couldn't get his custody until he made a name for himself in the film industry. His life with Hazel his second wife turned out to be a fine one without the ups and downs that affected his first one.The main attraction for watching this film was James Cagney an actor who always gave an honest performance. In here though he seems to be playing a variation on his own Yankee Doodle Dandy in the first segment devoted to his life as an entertainer in the theater. The other half his arrival in the movies is not as interesting as the beginning.The film directed by Joseph Pivney doesn't break new ground in the way the narrative plays in the film. Dorothy Malone who is seen as Cleva has some interesting moments. Jane Greer is also effective as the sweet Hazel the woman who always loved Chaney from afar.".

Dorothy Malone and Jane Greer play wives one and two. Dorothy Malone had just come off an Oscar the year before in Written on the Wind. This is a marvelous followup part for an actress that for ten years was thought as little more than ornamental.

I think some it was because I was a history teacherand to me history is sacredyou tell it exactly like it was. Yet in so many Hollywood films the truth isn't deemed interesting enough and they heavily embellish the picture. Thus is the story of Lon Chaney in The Man of a Thousand Faces. While the main points are correct Chaney's interesting life just wasn't interesting enough for the folks at Universal and they played fast and loose with some of the facts. I didn't like thisbut must acknowledge that it was an entertaining story.However there is one other issue about the film about which I have a unique perspective. Like Chaney I have a deaf family memberin my case my daughter. And because of this I can talk about a few things the average viewer wouldn't notice. When the people are using sign language in the film they really are using sign languagethough they do it a bit poorly. As a result you can see that the parents of Chaney in the film are not natural signersbut I appreciate that they tried. One thing I did not appreciate however is that the film seemed to exploit Chaney's parentscreating problems that did not exist in real life. For example when Chaney's first wife meets them she has no idea they are deafbut this was NOT the case in real life and it just felt cheaplike they were capitalizing on their deafness for the sake of a plot gimmick. That was pretty sad.Aside from my complaints and observations I still think this is a very good film. Just understand it all is heavily dramatized and you can take some of it with a grain of salt. Also it was nice to see the silent comic Snub Pollard in a bit scene midway through the film.".

Nearing the end of his long and distinguished career Cagney was already 10 years older than Chaney was when he died when filming began and is hardly convincing as a young and struggling vaudevillian and new father. Things improve when Chaney goes to Hollywood where the screenplay deals with his success as a character actor and his near miraculous ability to transform his face and body as necessary to play what became an amazing range of exotic and tortured characters.Unfortunately the writers choose to concentrate the bulk of the film on Chaney's family problems. Chaney's parents were deaf mutes which apparently accounted for their son's outsized gift for pantomime. But the screenplay treats deafness as if it were the plague something so embarrassing that Lon cannot bring himself to tell his pregnant wife played by Dorothy Malone that his parents are deaf. When she discovers the truth she reacts in an absurdly hysterical tantrum even threatening in a veiled sense of course after all this is 1957 to have an abortion rather than risk the possibility of giving birth to a deaf child.The Malone character is scapegoated throughout the film becoming the screenplay's surrogate for society's prejudice towards the deaf and later being punished for wanting her own career. Even though she eventually becomes a sympathetic character the script comes down strongly in favor of Chaney's second wife who dutifully gives up her own show business career to become the stayathome wife and stepmother to Chaney's young son.Jim Backus does his best in the role of Chaney's friendpress agent to keep from being a walking clich while forced to utter lines like  'Mystery' did you say? That's it! We'll call him 'Lon Chaney Man of Mystery!'  and  How many faces did you say? That's it! We'll call him 'Lon Chaney Man of a Thousand Faces!'  Jane Greer gives up her usual femme fatale persona to play Lon's devoted second wife and a very young Roger Smith plays son Creighton later to become Lon Chaney Jr. hoping to follow in his father's footsteps. The sodden direction by Joseph Pevney precludes any mystery as to how this story will resolve itself.Only the performance of James Cagney makes this film worth watching even as the script wallows in Hollywood kitsch and repellent 50s attitudes towards women and the handicapped.

Give me a break! That was poor casting if I ever saw it. What a disaster this film turned out to be. I prefer to remember Mr. Cagney for his great roles in the 1930s and 1940s.....not stinkers like this.";

	schema:reviewBody "James Cagney was 58 years old when he starred in this movie as Lon Chaney who died in 1930 at the age of 47. The story starts out in the early 1900s when Chaney was a Vaudeville performer in his 20s! His son was born in 1906 and he started working in films as an extra in 1912 or 1913 at the age of 30. Chaney divorced his first wife in 1913 and remarried in 1914. All of these events happened to Chaney before he was 31.While Cagney does give a good performance he's so too old for the role it's hard to get past it. The filmmakers try to hide it by having Cagney is clown makeup or or theatrical guise through a lot of the early part of the film when he's married to the first wife Dorothy Malone who's 33 here. With Malone out and the second wife Jane Greer also 33 in Cagney looks like their father.There's a lot of lip service to Chaney's film career which really took off with THE MIRACLE MAN in 1919. That film which exists now only in fragments starred Thomas Meighan and Betty Compson. Chaney had the showy supporting role of the Frog a role originated on Broadway by Percy Helton. This is pretty well done. We see lots of drawings of Chaney's subsequent characters in films and two of the most famous are reenacted.The main trouble with the reenactments of THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME and THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA is that while Chaney created his characters with makeup hooks wires and rubber so that his facial expressions were free. Cagney's disguises are mostly just Halloween masks and do not come close to the original creations.Irving Thalberg is played by Robert Evans whom Norma Shearer spotted by the pool at the Beverly Hills Hotel and promoted him for the role of her dead husband. Roger Smith plays Chaney's son. He was discovered by Cagney in Hawaii and promoted for the role of Chaney Jr.Others in the cast include Jim Backus as the press agent Marjorie Rambeau as the oldtime actress Marjorie Bennett as Vera the maid and Celia Lovsky as the mother. This film is probably a fine biopic if you know nothing about Lon Chaney. If you do then it comes across as a vanity production of the worst kind.".

In Cagney's biography Cagney on Cagney he admits that the story takes certain liberties with Chaney's life as most biopics do but there are many actual events in Chaney's life that are in the movie. Chaney was indeed the child of two deaf mute parents  he got his gift for pantomime in communicating with them. His first marriage was a rocky one just as the film portrays. Whether the trouble started over his first wife believing that their child would be deaf and being horrified by the possibility as is portrayed in the film I don't know but given early 20th century attitudes toward disability it is entirely possible.The film whether accurate or not was a loving tribute to Chaney that was instrumental in a revival of interest in his films.

	schema:reviewBody "Happened upon this on AMC one morning when home sick with a cold. Cagney immediately hooked me. It was interesting seeing such a powerful actor who usually portrays physically powerful and often violent characters in scenes of gentleness and sensitivity. Cagney apologizing Cagney saying he was afraid Cagney tenderly holding a child Cagney dressed as a clown as a woman. These are not the roles or behavior one expects when tuning in one of his movies. In the same way physical violence was not a primary plot device in the movie a refreshing change. To me Jim Baccus has always been Mr. McGoo. It was nice to see him throughout the movie in a good supporting role. I get the feeling his work as McGoo prevented him from getting solid roles. He appears as though he had more to offer. Does anyone else see a resemblance between Dorothy Malone in this movie and Sharon Stone today? I thought even her voice sounded like Stone's once or twice or rather Stone's sounds like Malone!. Malone did a good job but I think Greer was even better. Greer's performance here makes me want to see more of her. All the important supporting roles are well played. Occasionally the film editing andor writing jumps too quickly across too many years but it is still able to be followed. I think the film succeeds because it made the thousand faces the backdrop to the life of the man and the difficulties he faced. The characters are real and you care about them. Today Hollywood would probably do it the other way around making the makeup the story and giving shortshrift to the people. This picture gives the viewer a marvelous bonus. We watch to learn about Chaney and end up underneath it all getting Cagney too!".

	schema:reviewBody "It's possible Jimmy Cagney couldn't resist the role of Lon Chaney here because of the opportunity it gave him to draw on his own stage and vaudeville experience to perform a couple of dance numbers. There's certainly nothing else about this film  a typical Hollywood biopic that pays only loose attention to historical fact  to explain why he accepted a part that he was clearly too old to play. Chaney was only 47 when he died ten years younger than Cagney was when he filmed the role and was a rather gaunt figure whereas the middleaged Cagney had a round face although he appears to have slimmed down quite considerably for the part and was noticeably short in stature. Despite these drawbacks Cagney gives the best performance in the picture and arguably his best postCody performance. Although Cagney was a thoughtful man he was also a dynamic character and the role calls upon him to rein in that natural dynamism to a large degree. Even though he manages this admirably it's impossible for him to persuade us that he is the quiet man of few words that Chaney was. A passing reference is made to Chaney's quietness but it plays no major part in the portrayal.As with most Hollywood biopics the writers select a couple of the more sensational aspects of their subjects life around which they then construct an overwrought melodrama that bears little resemblance to reality. Chaney's parents were both deaf and mute but I don't recall this causing a major rift between him and his first wife. There was also some concern that their child may inherit his grandparent's mutedeafness but again I don't think it was the major crisis in Chaney and Cleva's relationship as it is here. I could be wrong of course but had only just completed reading a biography of Chaney's life when I happened upon this film. Cleva did destroy her singing voice when she attempted suicide  but she didn't attempt it on stage.The film devotes most of its time to Chaney's personal life but does offer occasional glimpses into the filmmaking business. A few scenes that demonstrates the chaotic process of studio filmmaking in the very early days of Hollywood when the absence of sound meant that several different genres of film could be shot alongside one another in an enclosed space are quite interesting but while we do see Cagney reenacting a few famous Chaney scenes the general impression is that his career is sidelined for much of the film.Chaney died in 1931 after making only one sound movie  a remake of his silent hit The Unholy Three. His premature death from lung cancer was the result of a lifetime of heavy smoking but we never once see a cigarette in Cagney's hands. Even as late as the late50s it seems that the studios were still portraying movie stars as Gods Amongst Us who could never be the instrument of their own demise. Here Chaney develops a mysterious cough. It is never explained but briefly described to an improbably handsome Creighton Chaney who would metamorphose into Lon Chaney Jr. as 'malignant' shortly before all personal and emotional problems are neatly resolved and dad can pass his famous make up box to son before ascending to the great studio in the sky.".

From what I've read Chaney Jr. also had a wider range of acting ability than is generally known since many of his especially later movies didn't give him the chance to showcase his abilities that's in addition to Chaney's alcoholism hampering his abilities.".

His performance is a real tourdeforce with him getting back to his roots as a dancer. We get to see the man we think of as Cody Jarrett and Tom Powers doing funny clown routines dancing impersonating an old woman and showing his warmer side. However this is both good and bad as Cagney does a great Cagney but he never becomes the person he is supposed to be that is the legendary Lon Chaney. Apart from the the true facts of Chaney's life being ignored a common thing in biopics the terrible script surprisingly Oscarnominated is standard soap opera at its worst with too much melodrama and too little of what made Chaney great. We get no insight on how he prepared his makeup or on how painful to wear it frequently was. Given that it's surprising a Chaney biopic was ever greenlighted as his life unlike that of so many movie stars was mostly secretive to public opinion and the few interesting anecdotes of him are not in the movie Creighton being born half dead and Lon getting him into icy water to revive him. And even worse a person that watches this movie without having seen any of Chaney's films will dismiss these as phony and corny and the makeups silly and badly done. The reconstructions of The Hunchback of Notre Dame and The Phantom of the Opera look like cheap Halloween masks made by a kid which is in itself an insult to Chaney's meticulous makeup and evidences only that short broad Cagney didn't look like tall thin Chaney the slightest not even under heavy makeup or masked or whatever. Cagney is only Cagney he's the Man of a Single Face and a very recognizable one. If you're gonna make the mistake of casting a big star to play a wellknown figure another common biopic error that way you only see the star and not the character at least cast a big star who resembles said figure. Casting Cagney as Chaney is like casting Danny De Vito as James Stewart.We DO get an insight as to his use of makeup and the pain it caused him. His instant creation of the Lascar's makeup is proof of that. And his portrayal of the deformed man in The Miracle and Quasimodo in Hunchback are proof of the pain. As far as the makeup is concerned they do not look cheap unless you try to compare them to current day makeup. And as far as Cagney being too short to play Chaney Lon was 5 ft 8 in and Cagney was 5 ft 7 in not much of a difference at all.Again if you are going to review at least get your facts straight!!!!! 10 of 10 for Jimmy and the movie 10 of 10 for DwightFry's poor critique!".

	schema:reviewBody "Man of a Thousand Faces is a film that positively reeks of Hollywood sap. It is quite obviously that the screenwriter took a look at a time line of Chaney's life and took out the major events only to write his own story. Jim Cagney stars as Lon Chaneythe man of a thousand faces. Chaney was a slender and tall man and Cagney was short and stubby.Is the film accurate? No not at all. The screenwriters obviously took a look at main events in Chaney's life and fabricated it to match a story. Cagney is a legend but he is not right at all for the role. Chaney was a tall and slender man and Cagney is short and stubby.Lon Chaney Jr was not born in a hospitalhe was born prematurely in Chaney's cabin in Oklahoma. The doctors were afraid the boy was still bornChaney took his Axe and rushed Lon Jr to the lakecut a hole in the winter ice and dunked him under. Cleva was 17 years old when Lon Jr was born.Chaney and his first wife Cleva had trouble finding work and were forced to travel the country with various theater groups searching for a job. Lonchaney.com's bio claims Lon Jr would steal sandwiches and money when the audience was not looking.The whole plot about Chaney having conflicts with his wife is silly. Lon Jr never left and he very much loved his father and would tour with him. Chaney had work but it was not until he starred in the Hunchback of Notre Dame did he gain the success he had. The makeup job was fantastic for the time and the uninformed movie goers thought that was Chaney's actual face. Also the movie glamorized his time at Universalyes his two major films were produced there but most of his films were made for MGM. In fact Universal fired Chaney because he thought he deserved more money.The ending is the part that gets me the most. Yes Chaney was sick but he died in his sleep.He never would let his illness get to himin fact he was planning on making a huge come back and moving into the talkies.Chaney Sr hated the idea of Lon Jr becoming an actor. He thought he needed a man's job and forced him to seek various odd jobs. Chaney Jr became an actor because he had a family to feed and he thought he could get work because he was Lon's son.The life of a legend is poked and pulled at until it was turned into this. The Soundtrack is horrible as wellthe music that plays when Chaney's mute parents are on screen is subtle racism to the deaf in my book. The movie is pathetic positively pathetic. Jim Cagney is an outstanding actorbut he should have never been offered this role. Chaney died at age 47Cagney was all ready 57 years old when he began making the film.If you do the math the movie begins in 1905 when Chaney was 24 years old.We can't expect historical accuracy with every movie but as a fan of Chaney I felt insulted watching this piece of crap.You know Lon Chaney would suffer for his artwe need more people like him and less people who want to milk a story for a dollar".

	schema:reviewBody "When James Cagney was cast as legendary silent film star Lon Chaney in 1957 he was 58 years old. That made him 11 years old than Chaney when he died of cancer in 1930. Which posed a formidable challenge  how to make a very middleaged Cagney look credible when portraying Chaney as a young man. Director Joseph Pevney's solution was to shoot Cagney almost exclusively in longshot for three quarters of the movie and also in shadow. Not artistically lit or subtle shadow mind you. These shadows are big and black and blot out Cagney's face. They're the kind of obscuring shadows that would have the director screaming cut! cut! CUT!! on any other film and then chewing out the cameraman in front of the whole crew for lighting the scene so ineptly. There is no reason for these shadows other than to obscure Cagney's features. They do nothing to create or enhance mood or convey a message. These are shadows that put the worst of film noir to shame. On the couple of occasions when Pevney attempts something resembling a medium closeup he overlights Cagney's face clumsily but effectively burning out any detail including his wrinkles. But Pevney's not simply a two or even three trick pony when it comes to concealing the ravages of time. He also has Cagney play several scenes in thick clown face makeup  because that's what we remember Chaney for. You might think that a biopic of Hollywood's first great horror actor might focus the bulk of its attention on recreating those years and films but MAN OF A THOUSAND FACES spends an inordinate amount of its overlong running time bringing us up to speed on Chaney's vaudeville career. I'm not doubting that it was an important training ground but do we really need to see the dancing clown routine more than once? Actually if it weren't for Pevney's hamfisted efforts to obscure Cagney's inappropriateness for the part this film would have very little to recommend it. If writer Ralph Wheelwright's account is to believed and from some sources I've read it might not be Chaney's personal life was a little on the turbulent side but the way it plays out here is so flat unimaginative and uninspired that it's a chore to stick with it. Within the limitations previously discussed Cagney gives a good account of himself demonstrating his versatility as an actor and a hoofer while suppressing most of the Cagneyisms that characterized many of his performances. But not for one moment did he lose himself in the part and that meant I never shook the feeling that I was watching him playing a part rather than watching him become the part.

	schema:reviewBody "When the preview of Z was shown at the Oscars it received a standing ovation. I didn't know why until I saw the movie. The Oscar forced it to be shown in the United States. At the time the US backed the military government in Greece. The totalitarian government represented a stand against communism. This movie depicts the true story of a beloved olympic athlete who became a doctor and began speaking out against his Greek government. For that he was murdered. This is about a brave investigator who begins to search for the origin of the orders to have the doctor killed.It leads to the downfall of a country. Mikis Theordorakis wrote the music from house arrest in Greece and it was smuggled out to be placed on the film. Yves Montand played the lead role and was blacklisted from getting a US Visa for his participation until some strings were pulled and he was allowed a 24 hour visa to be extended each 24 hours in order to allow him to film On A Clear Day You Can See Forever. At the end of filmingthat night he made a surprise appearance on Johnny Carson's Tonight Show. He told the story about Z and commented that he was in the care and custody of US Immigration and the FBI. The camera panned right and a dark suited man slid quickly behind the curtain. He apologized for his abruptness but his visa expired at midnight and he had to get to the airport. When I saw these things I was shocked my government would take a movie so seriously. When it showed up in an obscure movie theater in Houston I had to go. I was the only person buying a ticket just after noon that day. Upon entering the theater a dark suited man was sitting in the lobby. I walked into theater and then stuck my head back out to see what the only other individual in the theater was doing. He was stepping away from the ticket booth. I watched as he walked the short distance to my car took out a notebook and wrote in it while looking at my license plate. This is how it happened. It was 1969. J. Edgar Hoover had stated publicly that no truly loyal American would pay money to see such a movie. It was unpatriotic. Newspaper articles that spring reported it.Watch this movie and consider the importance entertainment can have on government media and yourself.".

Great acting was also put in by everybody and particularly by JeanLouis Trintignant who was great as the Examining Magistrate. As long as the script is concerned the plot builds up very satisfactorily and carefully thus not leaving any holes. Great respect should also be paid to Mikis Theodorakis who wrote the original score for the movie helping it gain the marvelous rythm it retained right until the very end of it.

After the fall of the military junta Z was worshiped although we saw it on TV much later in order to avoid stirring passions. In terms of the plot if you're not Greek it's quite possible you might be left with many unanswered questions but in general it is an accurate description of Greece during that era. While Vassilikos' novel written in 1966 has driven him to exile from 1967 Theodorakis was still in Greece under surveillance and managed to write his excellent score secretly. CostaGavras gives us a topclass fast paced direction which hasn't aged even today although I'm sure the Oscar was as much a political decision as a purely artistic one. What is truly spoton is the casting. Both Montand and Trintignant excel but even minor roles like Vago and Yago are portrayed in an extremely realistic way. My small objection would be Irene Papas staying nearsilent throughout the movie. Although her talent allows her to pull it off with class I really didn't understand why she was not supposed to talk.".

Not because I've read or heard anything about it but entirely because of the trailer I saw when it was first released back when I was 14.  Although I now remember more the feelings the trailer inspired than the trailer itself it still reminds me how awful trailers almost always are.  The trailer for Z was some the most intense exciting few seconds of film I had ever seen and I wanted to see more.  A brilliant ultrashort film production.  And it did it without revealing and spoiling the movie's story.  So when I finally did see Z I was able to enjoy something fresh and new.It wasn't what I expected but turned out to be one of the best political thrillers I've ever seen.  You don't really have to know Greek history to see it in part because the movie never explicitly mentions Greece.  Better to do it the other way around by getting swept up in the gritty often tawdry intrigues you will be learning Greek history without realizing it. Or if you are into conspiracies and coverups in general you'll learn how they really aren't the brilliantly crafted masterplans of distant omnipotent figures that most movies show but are usually the creation of dull mediocrities full of flaws stupidities and hamfisted improvisations.  That they often succeed is more because of brute force than any innate cleverness.  This is a powerful and effective movie which is almost certainly due to its being based closely on reality and the passions that inspired it's making and from it not being a recycled and denatured Hollywood product.  I highly recommend it.".

By 1949 the civil war was over with Greece under military rule.Then the story portrayed in Z. Dr. Gregorios Lambrakis was beginning to speak for the people when the junta gunned him down. In Z we get to see the investigation into the murder exposing how the generals orchestrated it. They never say that the movie happens in Greece although it clearly does and more than simply a look at the CIAinstalled regime that was ruling Greece from 1967 to 1974 it's a reminder of all totalitarian governments in the world. Z will very likely chill you.".

No country is safe and it could be argued in areas of Florida today that even though we preserved our nation and eliminated Nixon it was a Pyrhic victory a temporary victory and our democracy and how it is supposed to ethically work was left disheveled and browbeaten in the end anyway. One thing is for certain the rats are in the cupboard now. And this film hits all the right buttons great music acting an avant garde documentary style of filming that was sensational in its time and still is good today but so many people have copied it it seems to lack originality since we are so accepting now of something that was novel at the time...but this is the real thing that started it all.

	schema:reviewBody "Any resemblance to actual events to persons living or dead is not the result of chance. It is DELIBERATE. With that caption albeit in French in the opening credits the stage is set for Z. Made in 1969 the film is based on the novel about the May 22 1963 assassination of Greek politician Gregoris Lambrakis. Yet it is far from your average history based and instead becomes a thriller. It is also perhaps more importantly a look at the misuse of government power in a democratic society and those willing to expose it.The film features what can be called a perfect cast. JeanLouis Trintignant is the Examining Magistrate the government official who is supposed to sign off on the police's version of events but discovers the truth is much different. Then there's the officials involved including Pierre Dux as chief of police and Julien Guiomar as his deputy who both give fine performances as men in power who become increasingly desperate to close the case. There are those directly involved in the assassination such as Renato Salvatori and Marcel Bozzuffi who convincingly play ordinary people who political beliefs and the power of public officials lead them to commit the assassination. Last but not least are Yves Montand as the Deputy aka Gregoris Lambrakis and Irene Papas as his wife both of whom use their rather limited screen time to great effect. There really didn't seem to be a single miscast part which is an incredible rarity and something that makes the film even better.This brings us to the production values of Z. While the film was shot in on the opposite side of the Mediterranean in Algiers though it makes for a fine substitute for the Greek locations where the events actually took place which is helped even more by the use of things like a Greek typewriter in scenes with the Examining Magistrate for example. Perhaps as a consequence of that there seems to be very few sets in the film which helps even more to give a sense of verisimilitude to the entire film. The film also replays the assassination several times after showing it to the viewer in its entirety to show how points of view and ulterior motives can affect views of an event something echoed by Oliver Stone in his 1991 film JFK. The film's editing allows the action of the film's first half to be a bit more drawn out as it paints a portrait of the events leading up to the rally where the assassination takes place yet allowing for it to have the pace of a thriller when the investigation of the Examining Magistrate begins allowing for flashbacks from different witnesses. The result of all this is a film that seems very realistic slowly paced at times and yet tightly paced when it needs to be.Then there is the script of course. The script written by Jorge Semprn and director CostaGavras is a casebook example of how a reallife vent should be transposed to the silver screen as it condenses a significant amount of time down to two hours without confusing the viewer or being tedious. The script also pulls no punches with its views of the right wing government of Greece at the time though the country is unnamed in the film starting with appears at first to be a lecture about agricultural policy that leads into a rant about the government's wanting to destroy the mildew of the mind i.e. everything to the left of it politically. From there the script shows how officials how officials allowed the assassination to happen and how they then tried to hide their involvement as quickly as possible. The script shows even those not involved under pressure or by being complacent try to stall the investigations of the man charged with finding the truth the Examining Magistrate. Considering when the film came out and the events in the years preceding it is hard to see why it was so successful here in the U.S. and why it continues to have strong resonance today especially considering that the assassinations of Lambrakis and JFK were a mere six months apart. The script is above all a demonstration of misuse of government power the lengths it will go to cover its own tracks and those who are willing to expose it.Z is many things. It is a true story told like a thriller that shows how a historical event would be put on the screen. It is a fine film that is well acted by a perfect cast all of whom are backed by good production values fine editing and a script that pulls no punches. Above all though I believer it is a warning. To whom is it a warning? To those who say that something like this can't happen in a democratic society because in 1963 it happened there.".

The script is above all a demonstration of misuse of government power the lengths it will go to cover its own tracks and those who are willing to expose it.Z is many things. It is a true story told like a thriller that shows how a historical event would be put on the screen. It is a fine film that is well acted by a perfect cast all of whom are backed by good production values fine editing and a script that pulls no punches. Above all though I believer it is a warning. To whom is it a warning? To those who say that something like this can't happen in a democratic society because in 1963 it happened there.";

Sure enough truthfully documenting governmental corruption the epilogue tells how all he is mysteriously removed from the case and all the others involved in the prosecutor side die accidentally are deported or incarcerated.

Notably the only film to date nominated by The Academy for both Best Picture  Best Foreign Language Film. It won in the latter category. Wonderful musical score. CostaGavras masterfully tailors in the perfect balance of intensity and suspense. A subtle thriller with the protagonist a mysterious fighter hiding behind his glasses his partner photojournalist hiding behind his lens. We might never really get to know these characters in the details of their everyday lives but we feel we know what constitutes their characters what beliefs and values they fiercely adhere to and ultimately what makes them the individuals they are.

In our dark time in which democracy is stomped this committed production is just a needy breath of air. For one time political power isn't told as courageous bold historic but rather as corrupted authoritarian. In short the movie doesn't depict them as how they would like to appear but rather as how they really are. It's also a excellent lesson in constitutional law as it illustrates the meaning of the separation of powers  a real democracy is where each power is independent. Thus here you can conclude it isn't one as the administration is vehement to tell the judiciary what it must does. At last it's a extraordinary story about courage and conviction. A bit like  Schindler's list  this movie demonstrates that the psychopathic state relies on individual and as soon as one says  no  he can become the little grain of stand that blocks the machine. Here Trintignant is a young judge who stays truth to his function and it's all the more funny and powerful that he's highly clever  he doesn't look up much but he knows exactly what to do to put the culprits in his web !In conclusion this movie is just an oasis in film history and it should inspire newcomers to do the same instead of serving propaganda !".

	schema:reviewBody "Well I didn't watch this show on cinema I watched it about 2 months after the actual premiere and it is showed on cable TV.Well the story was quite good it tells about 2 individuals that had problems with love similar to each other and apparently been told in both male and female point of view is quite original but still fall short to grab the audiences. The fact that they used unknown actors has its own pros and cons. Some actors actually put a spice on the movie but the other just made the movie look dull and destroying the over all illusion.Now the major problem is on the miseenshot the director or the producer can spend more money on lighting or learn how to use it properly. I mean don't they know that neon light give out green light. If they going for the Matrix green look that's understandable but the matrix uses high power neon light to clear up the shadows. The second thing is the shadows there're so many shadows build up on the actors especially neck and below the eyes and this just make the overall scenes look dull. Don't get me wrong I know they use lighting in certain part of the movie but people haven't you heard about white balance and if you mess it up already use the gamma correction or the RGB color balance or even reshot. Believe me reshooting is better than leaving the scenes as it is since one of the major factors of a movie is over all visualization.Money is not the problem here believe me I seen movie with very little budget do wonders oversea and in Malaysia it self. The Blair Witch Project The beautiful washing machine just to name a few. The camera shouldn't be a problem also is you can used film in all of the scenes be different. Michael Mann Collateral and the up coming Miami Vice used Digital video and it looks great is different some people might not like it but is has that xfactors that put it on different class above the rest. Or you can change the frame rate to 24p some high end digital camera has that now like canon XL2 hell some short film uses mini dv cam and the visualization looks amazing.Well I guess is just they did spend more time during the post production period and do a bit more research on how to handle things. If they did that believe me it will make this movie a much better movie. Neither the less it was a good effort hope they'll learn from their mistake and correct it on their next project.".

Directed by Woo Ming Jin this will be his first featurelength theatrical release. His previous movie Monday Morning Glory received encouraging reviews. Previously he has made several short films that have won awards and music videos.The cast in this movie are relatively new to the big screen. Raja Farah currently stars in Impian Illyana shown on NTV7 Pierre Andre was recently seen in Gol  Gincu and Chelsia Ng and Jojo Struys were in Kopitam together. Having new talent on screen doesn't make it bad in fact this new approach made Salon a refreshing watch.Luna Raja Farah and Ezra's Pierre Andre characters may not be a couple in the movie but their chemistry is really explosive. Producers please pair them up in a future movie! Personally I think that the 17yearold Raja Farah is a good actress. However her role as a twentysomething entrepreneur soontobe wife is a little unsuitable. Not when she's 17 anyway. But overall I can see her doing many movies in time to come.Pierre Andre's portrayal as the sweet and quiet Ezra Fernandez is great. He's someone many Malaysian males can relate to stressed out at work loves eating at the mamak and is longing for someone to love. Director Woo Ming Jin made the characters believable and lovable. A few corny lines can be found in the movie but that doesn't hamper it. Happy stuff aside Salon also deals with real life problems.There are a few cameos in Salon from the likes of Syanie as one of Luna's clients Khatijah Tan as an Indonesian cleaning lady and funnyman cum director Ho Yuhang as a typical Chinaman who fought with his wife. Yuhang's cameo is absolutely hilarious and is actually one of the best scenes in the movie.Chelsia Ng plays Emma the secretary at Ezra's work place. She may seem happy and bubbly on the outside but there's something hidden behind the facade of smiles. Chelsia's acting really stands out and shows that she can act outside comedy. Jojo Struys plays Zora Luna's halfMalay halfCaucasian wild and sexy cousin. Her comparisons on human relationships to the female anacondas mating habits are just yummy. There are not enough scenes of Jojo though. Sad.With a new age of Malaysian cinema upon us Salon is a good addition to the building library of Malaysian movies lead by a new wave of directors. With the success of Sepet Malaysian movies are going where no Malaysian films have gone before.".

	schema:reviewBody "First of all I don't have better words to describe this movie. What I am trying to say here is that this movie is extremely awful and ruined my life for entire day. In other words this movie bored me to death. For those Malay out there who are still trying to borrow this movie from friends or from stores or downloading from Bittorrent my advice to you is please stop it immediately. It is not worth at all to spend your little time in your life to watch this movie because if you still do it you are just wasting your time. If you still want to waste your time please do it in different way. For e.g. how about watching Badul's movie or Doraemon 10X rather than watching this extremely terrible movie.In my humble opinion at the first place the director of this movie did not do hisher homework. Heshe just picked up the camera and shot the movie without analyzing the script and plot of the movie. May be heshe in the 'rush' and did not have time to discuss with their fellows friend too. That's why I did not find any good story conflict in this movie. The 'art' in this movie is far worst. The dialog blurred me to death. At the second half of this movie I still cannot follow the main conflict and I thought may be this is the documentary of stupid actorsactress in how to learn acting in maturedteen's drama. At last after recovered from trauma because of this movie I've found the answer this movie is a grave mistake and have been released at the wrong time at the wrong place at the wrong person. It appears to me that the quality of this movie is just like 2minute MaggieNoodle most likely a brand of food that consumed by the entire crews of this movie My 'humble' suggestion is that the producersdirectors of Malay film should attend a detailed course maybe 12 years in how to produce a better movie which could attract educated Malaysian. If they still stubborn to follow this simple rule FINAS Malaysian Film authority should take legalaction. For e.g. they should ask those stubborn producersdirectors to attend counseling or force them to produce a reason letter on why they skip the course and still produce lousy movies before suspending their license.I really hope that my comment is useful ".

De Funes singing in a nunschoir is hilarious. De Funes patting everybody on the back to check if they sound hollow and stabbing his boss in his ass because he thinks he's an alien is great. Also the scenes where Baupied's alien looka like offers him a flower and where De Funes' cap is set on fire by an alien are classics.

	schema:headline " Not that bad but the lousiness of some gags is even more unbelievable than the scifi plot...";
	schema:reviewBody "Probably tired of unsuccessful invasions and infiltrations of Earth via the United States our good old aliens aboard their notsounidentifiable flying saucers think they'll have a better shot with Saint Tropez they just didn't count on our valiant defenders of bikiniclad widows and playingwithsand orphans the Extraterrestrials are coming and the Troop is back!Still the decade it took for that fifth installment to be released feels like a real change of era that affected all the cast... and not just in the looks department. In 1979 the babyboomers who twisted in SaintTropez were adults whose preoccupation were rooted in reality and oil prices so I'm not sure watching a frail old Funs dressed as a nun and making faces not to be recognized was the proper cure for laughs. That 'Salve Regina' sounds rather like the swan song of the agonizing old school of French comedy.But courageously director Jean Girault and screenwriter Jacques Wilfrid stick to their guns and all the actors are certainly more heroic than their fictional counterparts in the way they indulge to the same shticks over and over without fearing to look ridicule. But there are signs that can't fool us the most visible ones are the replacements of Christian Marin and Jean Lefebvre by similarly looking substitutes Maurice Risch short but chubbier and JeanPierre Rambal tall but less goofy. It's quite symbolic that Merlot and Fougasse were the two who welcomed Cruchot at his arrival and quite sad that no one notices their absence.To their defense they don't hurt the film and Maurice Risch a regular De Funs' partner who's been labeled as a poor man's Jacques Villeret given the obvious resemblance dis fit to the role. The real issue is with the replacement of Claude Gensac as Cruchot's wife by Maria Mauban. Gensac was unavailable so Mauban did her best with a secondrate script that overloads de Funs' dialogues with many my doe ma biche! in case we forgot who she was. So The Troops and the ExtraTerrestrials has many new faces and the old ones have aged too much aging even contaminated the writing because it's dated even by the 70s standards. In other words the first act was a disaster starting with Beaupied Risch discovering a flying saucer and going all bananas about it. Granted there is no De Funs movie without a fair deal of hysteria here the joke is used ad nauseam with mediacircus branddropping neologisms and verbalisms so embarrassing you just wish the plot can move to somewhere else. I tried to watch it with the benevolence of a parent who sees his child and knows a Laurence Olivier he'll never be but seeing all these talented actors clowning around and trying to make us believe that stabbing someone's butt by mistake is funny... with the summit of bad taste in that shot on the Colonel's bleeding pants. The craze goes on and then it starts to loosen up and even gets better near the middle. I often criticized some De Funs' movies to start very well and then getting slower or rushed out at the end this is the opposite case and I only wish the warmup wasn't so long because it could have redeemed the film.Which takes me back to that summer of 1989 where as a kid I discovered De Funs through a TV cycle dedicated to the Troops series. If my memories don't fail me it was one of the first I saw and I didn't take it as a comedy. The sight and sound of the aliens the ominous music the rusty sound they made and even that 'bong' when you knocked their body used to give me the creeps. Besides I never liked plots were identities were reversed for all the misunderstandings they induced. I guess I took that film too seriously but strangely enough there were a few scenes that I still appreciated for their 'serious' undertones.There's a moment for instance where Galabru is alone in civilian clothes and follows an alien who'd just been splashed by water and is dying his body makes mechanical noises his dislocation is showed like a real agony and his death is symbolized by the fading sound of his tune watch and there's no moment where Galabru plays it comical. He's alone in the beach of St Tropez like Charlton Heston in Planet of the Apes and the whole scene plays like something that could have come from straight scifi. It was quite powerful. The following scene is one of these outbursts of comedic genius you find even in the worse De Funs when they all knock their heads and they make metallic sounds only with a different tone though it had me confused as hell when I was younger I didn't get the joke the punchline of can belong to one of the Top 10 gendarmes moments. I guess that's the magic of the series after all each one has something to offer for the legacy. And it's weird that De Funs the actor known for straight comedies would play for his final six roles following his heart attack in two memorable scifi films both involving the classic flying saucers. The scifi element is handled pretty well I especially like the effort Raymond Lefebvre took to put electronic sound in his work and special effects that can seem a bit Bmoviesque compared to Star Wars but they hold up well honorable mention to the part when the Troops fought against their lookalikes and I was wondering how they would pull it. Naturally they went the easy way who said they had to fight their counterpart after all?Now I'm not sure the climax inside the flying saucer was necessary with the final parade and the Troops making their obligatory march there was an opportunity for a great last gag  la Breast of Leg? that would have earned the film an extra point.".

The jokes were a little silly. I think about the scene were Gerber says that Cruchot peed in his bed at the age of 14. Another example the scene where one of the gendarmettes loses her skirt over all I think that there was too much nudity humor.On the positive side we have the acting. The gang from Le gendarme et les extraterrestres is back with de Funs Michel Galabru Claude Gensac Guy Grosso Michel Modo Patrick Prjean Maurice Risch and Jacques Francois. They all make a very good job as usual. The actresses who plays the gendarmettes were okay even if there acting wasn't breath taking.Over all a pretty mediocre movie. But at the same time it holds a certain atmosphere since it was the last film made by de Funs and director Jean Girault. I give it five stars.".

	schema:reviewBody "Comedic series usually falter down after the third opus when even the most forgiving audience can't overlook the enormity of a halfassed script and the lousiness of halfbaked gags. But every golden rule has an exception and The Troops of St. Tropez series is the perfect illustration that the antidote to these detestable screen symptoms has only only ingredient starpower. Louis de Funs was a living audiencedrainer. After the 1964 hit the team could adapt to the craziest formulas they were fishes out of water in New York City they got married they were set apart and reunited they even fought Aliens and each time the film never attracted less than four million viewers. Neither did The Troops and the Troopettes despite challenging every notion of bad taste and dated humor.Maybe it was time for the series to end. Maybe the sight of a fraillooking De Funs was an indirect reminder of the living thunderbolt he used to be. Maybe watching him trying to hold his grimaces and gesticulations was like watching the Lemmon of Grumpy Old Men while reminiscing Some Like it Hot. Maybe a seventh opus would have put a deathblow on his winning streak. But the actor died three months after the release reputation unsoiled and legacy ensured by millions of viewers and trillions of laughs. His death was a sad time for French cinema but came at a good timing because the torch was being passed to a new breed of humor screwball Pierre Richard under Veber's sophisticated direction or biting satire with the Splendid Troop. The days of glory were over and a crisisstricken France generated a more mature audience craving for some social commentary behind the jokes.Even Jean Girault who died during the filming of Troopettes and De Funs felt the change of wind and made a different movie with The Cabbage Soup a film that showed the loneliness of isolated farmers and the effects of modernity in rural France. Looking up my Cabbage Soup review I said it was the penultimate movie of the oldtime partners and their ultimate classic if we forgive the final Gendarmes movie in 1982. I'm glad I didn't say forget or dismiss but I suspect I'll be in a minority if I say that the ultimate de Funs' movie wasn't the ultimate outrage many fans claim it to be... I concede that some parts can be outrageously bad but outrageously and uninterestingly are two separate words and inbetween there is a realm of enjoyment that prompted me to wear my 'devil's advocate' coat. Sure it is a turkey but I would say a turkey...  l'orange!Addressing the elitist section of movie fans cinematic purists or the cohort of cinephiles drooling over anything stamped Nouvelle Vague I say yes your honor The Troops and the Troopettes is a neverending series of outdated jokes overthetop tantrums and cringeworthy exploitations of women that make Benny Hill look like Monty Python not to mention some unnecessary racist jokes... yet there wasn't one second in the film where I was bored which I guess is a basic accomplishment for a comedy. The first Troops movies had their slowest moments and their share of lame gags but they were never as daring and bold as the last onzq... and I've got to admire a movie that pushes the level of bad taste up to eleven if it doesn't make you laugh it finds a way to impress you. What's more impressive is that the film manages to be driven by a plot crazynun driving but driving nonetheless. Four new recruits who all seemed to come up from Givenchy ads and naturally catch the eye of our six gendarmes one has a double effect because of her ethnicity as it seems that our old Frenchies aren't accustomed to the sight of an African woman. Now ethnic gags were hitormiss with De Funs it was a disaster in The Tattoo but hilarious in The Mad Adventures of Rabbi Jacob. The references to Macumba's origins are so redundant it stops being funny but the film insists so much that it ends up ridiculing the Troops not the woman the film even uses the beginning of a racial slur as if it really highlighted some old colonial bigotry it's not as subtle as in a Tarantino movie but it's so outrageous it becomes inoffensive. We forgive them they're just outoftouch old guys De Funs Galabru Jacques Franois even the youngest ones Guy Grosso and Michel Modo can't hide their white hair and balding sideline while Patrick Prjean and Maurice Risch provides the 'young' touch... which isn't saying much.What's more to forgive? Well the plot is an improbable salad made of JamesBond like situations and stunts improvised choreographies cartoon gags vaudeville hysteria with a Claude Gensac more excitable than ever and Grand Guignol histrionic mimics where it seems that Galabru waited for the final film to have the upper vocal timber on Cruchot. The whole thing is insane indigestible noisy but it has a few sweet and tender moments. And amidst that brouhaha something happened I didn't expect it opened my eye on the notion of overthetop and made me accept that there comes a moment where comedy needs to stop being too subtle and just implode its ugly irreverent side to the face of the earth. Interestingly the very actors who dethroned De Funs would play in similar overthetop movies in the 90s but in 1982 they wanted their idol to star with them in their movie Gramps is in the Resistance but fate decided otherwise Galabru played the Gramps part and the film was dedicated to his longtime partner. But one can't watch Troopettes with bitter eyes for the role that made him a star was the perfect swan song for Louis de Funs. In a way the film is about a bunch of gramps who are resisting... the march of modernity through one last musical march across St Tropez.".

	schema:headline " Rainier Alfred Charles and Grace";
	schema:reviewBody "The one to blame for Tippi Hedren and not Grace Kelly starring in Hitchcock's 'Marnie' is really Charles De Gaulle. At least that's what 'Grace of Monaco' suggests. It's probably not quite true but the film doesn't pretend to be historically accurate. It says so at the beginning it's a fictional drama based on true events. The film shows a relatively small part of Kelly's remarkable life. After having been married for six years to Prince Rainier of Monaco she is visited by Alfred Hitchcock who offers her the lead in his film project 'Marnie'. She wants to do it but reviving her acting career turns out to be impossible because of a crisis in Monaco caused by French president Charles De Gaulle's political manoeuvrings. We see Kelly as a somewhat naive Princess who against her will becomes involved in political powerplay. When a French diplomat suggests that Europe should become a third pillar of world power next to the Soviet Union and the US the Americanborn Kelly quips that this wouldn't be necessary if Europe wouldn't have invented communism and fascism. It's one of the best oneliners in the film. The story switches nicely from Rainier's political problems to Kelly's own personal doubts. She is not happy as a Princess and has trouble with the rigid conventions of life at the palace. The film even suggests that her outspoken opinions help solving the problems with France in the end. This may not be historically correct but it makes for a nice script. Much has been said about casting Nicole Kidman. I think there are very few actresses on the globe who would have done a better job. I'm not exactly a big fan of Kidman but in this case she shows exactly the right mix of a strong will a fearless nonconformist attitude and a superb elegance. She fits in perfectly with the cinematography full of warm colours and lush images. I liked the way the script works towards an apotheosis a speech by Kelly at a highprofile philanthropic event in Monaco. The speech is truly great either it's very good script writing or Kelly employed a very talented speech writer. It's the highlight of the film Kidman delivers her text in a truly heartfelt way with the camera extremely close so only a part of her face is visible. The film has weak points. The dialogue sometimes feels clumsy and pompous there are too many subplots and intrigues and the director indulges a bit too much in the glamorous palace life. But at least this film doesn't make the mistake of cramming too much biographical information into a 100minute movie. It's an enjoyable movie about one of the most interesting women in film history.".

	schema:headline " There isn't much grace to be had in this formless awkwardlyscripted and executed biopic.";
	schema:reviewBody "Biopics will always come with their fair share of controversy  doubts will inevitably be raised about whether the subject in question was wellserved by the film and his or her characterisation therein. Even so Grace Of Monaco arrives in cinemas dogged by an outsized share of debate and well debacle. The script has been openly decried by Princess Grace's children and the entire project overwhelmingly reviled by critics across the world. Distributor Harvey Weinstein reportedly riled French director Olivier Dahan by cooking up an alternative cut of the film. Of course it's Dahan's version that has premiered in Cannes to widespread critical derision so one can't help wondering if Weinstein's cut might actually be better. That's a lot of weight and scandal for one film to bear most of which is  unfortunately  borne out by the final product.It's possible to see why everyone involved might have been optimistic about the project. After all the film purports to pick apart the fairy tale that is Grace Kelly's life  a legendary Hollywood actress finds and marries her reallife prince. In reality Grace Nicole Kidman is struggling to find her place in the tiny principality of Monaco. As she contemplates returning to Hollywood to make another picture  Marnie  with Alfred Hitchcock Roger AshtonGriffiths Grace's husband Prince Rainier Tim Roth finds himself trapped in an increasingly tense faceoff with French President Charles De Gaulle. Add in courtly intrigue an identity crisis or two a fairytale romance gone a little bit wrong  and it seems the perfect way for Dahan to make his Hollywood debut.However much of the sensitivity demonstrated by Dahan in La Vie En Rose his lovely bittersweet biopic of Edith Piaf has been lost in translation. Grace Of Monaco plays far too frequently at the full high pitch of soapy melodrama the converging story lines somehow managing to feel overwrought and inconsequential at the same time. Grace frets about her role as wife mother and princess Rainier broods moodily about the fate of Monaco we're led to suspect that Grace's handmaiden Madge Parker Posey is a spy within her inner circle  huge important events within the narrative of the film but all of them are rendered in paperthin characterisation and overly ponderous dialogue.As the film stumbles towards its unlikely climax it becomes harder and harder to take it seriously. The unravelling threads of Grace's life are clumsily woven together by what amounts to Grace undergoing princess training at the hands of Sir Derek Jacobi's Count Fernando a montage that would feel clumsy even if grafted into My Fair Lady or The Princess Diaries. Grace Of Monaco also runs afoul of a few odd directorial choices. It's no exaggeration to say that Dahan makes the most excessive use of the closeup since Tom Hooper in Les Miserables  in narrowing the frame to an almost unbearable degree his camera practically assaults his actors' eyeballs on several occasions. To be fair to the cast they try  particularly Kidman who seems quite committed to giving as rounded a performance of the trapped princess as she can whatever her director or screenwriter might have in store for her. Her efforts aren't enough to salvage the film but at least she's not adding to its many problems. Other reliably good actors chew over but fail to elevate the mediocre script Roth's Rainier remains a frustratingly opaque character while Frank Langella is quite wasted as Father Francis Tucker a pastor whose strangely controlling relationship with Grace adds a few more wrinkles to the already oddlyconstructed plot.In effect Grace Of Monaco brings to mind that other mess of a princess biopic Diana. Both films have impressive pedigrees from director to headlining actress and both seem to have completely failed to grasp  much less do justice to  their subject.

	onyx:emotionText "Biopics will always come with their fair share of controversy  doubts will inevitably be raised about whether the subject in question was wellserved by the film and his or her characterisation therein. Even so Grace Of Monaco arrives in cinemas dogged by an outsized share of debate and well debacle. The script has been openly decried by Princess Grace's children and the entire project overwhelmingly reviled by critics across the world. Distributor Harvey Weinstein reportedly riled French director Olivier Dahan by cooking up an alternative cut of the film. Of course it's Dahan's version that has premiered in Cannes to widespread critical derision so one can't help wondering if Weinstein's cut might actually be better. That's a lot of weight and scandal for one film to bear most of which is  unfortunately  borne out by the final product.It's possible to see why everyone involved might have been optimistic about the project. After all the film purports to pick apart the fairy tale that is Grace Kelly's life  a legendary Hollywood actress finds and marries her reallife prince. In reality Grace Nicole Kidman is struggling to find her place in the tiny principality of Monaco. As she contemplates returning to Hollywood to make another picture  Marnie  with Alfred Hitchcock Roger AshtonGriffiths Grace's husband Prince Rainier Tim Roth finds himself trapped in an increasingly tense faceoff with French President Charles De Gaulle. Add in courtly intrigue an identity crisis or two a fairytale romance gone a little bit wrong  and it seems the perfect way for Dahan to make his Hollywood debut.However much of the sensitivity demonstrated by Dahan in La Vie En Rose his lovely bittersweet biopic of Edith Piaf has been lost in translation. Grace Of Monaco plays far too frequently at the full high pitch of soapy melodrama the converging story lines somehow managing to feel overwrought and inconsequential at the same time. Grace frets about her role as wife mother and princess Rainier broods moodily about the fate of Monaco we're led to suspect that Grace's handmaiden Madge Parker Posey is a spy within her inner circle  huge important events within the narrative of the film but all of them are rendered in paperthin characterisation and overly ponderous dialogue.As the film stumbles towards its unlikely climax it becomes harder and harder to take it seriously. The unravelling threads of Grace's life are clumsily woven together by what amounts to Grace undergoing princess training at the hands of Sir Derek Jacobi's Count Fernando a montage that would feel clumsy even if grafted into My Fair Lady or The Princess Diaries. Grace Of Monaco also runs afoul of a few odd directorial choices. It's no exaggeration to say that Dahan makes the most excessive use of the closeup since Tom Hooper in Les Miserables  in narrowing the frame to an almost unbearable degree his camera practically assaults his actors' eyeballs on several occasions. To be fair to the cast they try  particularly Kidman who seems quite committed to giving as rounded a performance of the trapped princess as she can whatever her director or screenwriter might have in store for her. Her efforts aren't enough to salvage the film but at least she's not adding to its many problems. Other reliably good actors chew over but fail to elevate the mediocre script Roth's Rainier remains a frustratingly opaque character while Frank Langella is quite wasted as Father Francis Tucker a pastor whose strangely controlling relationship with Grace adds a few more wrinkles to the already oddlyconstructed plot.In effect Grace Of Monaco brings to mind that other mess of a princess biopic Diana. Both films have impressive pedigrees from director to headlining actress and both seem to have completely failed to grasp  much less do justice to  their subject. In a pinch Grace Of Monaco is the slightly better film there are more complexities at play here that can be glimpsed amidst the shillyshallying of the script. There is at least more of an attempt made to look beyond the princess' love story to find the person within. That's not saying much however. For the most part Grace Of Monaco is an awkward frustrating watch  one that ultimately fails to establish its title character as either person or princess.";

A fictional story based on true events this enjoyable film was a very haunting portrayal of Grace Kelly's move from Hollywood Princess to Royal Princess and the difficulties that arose during the transition. Centred around the very trying times when Charles de Gaulle was trying to gain control of Monaco Grace Kelly was portrayed as a lost figure. Lost in her marriage lost in her identity and lost in her way. Unfortunately Nicole Kidman although a very accomplished actress who was dressed well and at time did look very much the princess did not convince me that she was Princess Grace. For starters physically she was too red Grace Kelly was blonde not a Marilyn Monroe sort of blonde but a regal blonde and a serene blonde Nicole just looked like a red head furthermore she didn't make me believe that she was Grace Kelly I just felt that I could see many of her other parts all tumbling together to try to encompass this icon of movie and Royal history. Having said that I don't know exactly who could have played the part of Princess Grace of Monaco.........except perhaps ......... Grace Kelly!!!!!".

There are some great biopics around 'Amadeus' and 'The Elephant Man' being prime examples' but also some naff ones. While not quite as poor as 'Diana' or 'William and Kate' films with much worse editing and feel far more like Lifetime projects 'Grace of Monaco' is one of the naff ones if not entirely without honour.The best thing about 'Grace of Monaco' is the production values the sumptuous costumes sets and scenery looking absolutely breathtaking often. The film is very nicely shot too though it's not without its dizzying or pedestrian moments in the editing.It is agreed that Nicole Kidman is miscast which will be and has been a turnoff for most being at least a decade too old four inches too tall Kelly was tall but not as much as Kidman who is one of the tallest actresses in Hollywood and not as natural a beauty as evident in some stiff and plastic facial expressions. However it is whether she gave a good enough performance despite the miscasting that matters and Kidman actually gives a very committed performance that's charismatic and deeply felt too. The other good performance is the gleefully enjoyable Hitchcock of Roger AshtonGriffiths who does try to bring needed urgency to the proceedings the culminating banquet actually being the film's dramatic highlight.However Tim Roth is too archetypal and too much of a dork as Rainier while Robert Lindsay plays his very roughly drawn character too broadly and Derek Jacobi and particularly Frank Langella are wasted. There are some odd accents going on as well as well as a lack of chemistry and the characters are bland or annoying stereotypes some not feeling relevant to the story and are as plastic as Kidman's Botox.Faring worst are the very empty and halfbaked script that sounds like soap opera past its sell by date an overwrought and overbearing music score that is too reminiscent of a comedy or a heavyhanded drama and the direction which sees violent and frequently jarring shifts in tone that suggests that those responsible had no idea what the film was trying to be or what to focus on. The story tries to be careful not to offend but ends up being dull dramatically soggy and laughably ridiculous with an overlong running time that makes some of the story feel stretched.Overall hugely disappointing looks good and Kidman's performance is committed but what gives a film weight depth and staying power is lost in translation. 310 Bethany Cox".

Add to that Charles De Gaulle's impending invasion and the principality's nosedive into economic ruin and all was not happy in Grace's life. Allegedly.Grace of Monaco is a long way from Dahan's 2007 biopic triumph La Vie en Rose. It is far too long far too dull with questionable 'truth' and rather too much melodrama. Dahan repeatedly cuts to lingering ECUs of Kidman's eyes vainly hoping that soft focus shots of her regal visage will imbue his film with serenity and beauty. It doesn't. It merely serves to increase the boredom and slow the pace still further.No matter how good Kidman and Roth are they cannot raise Grace of Monaco above the status of star Sunday afternoon matine to the magnificent period piece it desperately wants to be. Both actors are pleasant to watch here with Grace's relationship with Frank Langella's Father Tucker a highlight that allows Kidman to scratch under the veneer of the princess. Likewise Roth is more than adequate as the overbearing monarch who occasionally remembers to show he cares about his wife but it lacks the truth of his sensitive and truthful performance in last year's fantastic Broken.When Roger Ashton Griffiths waddles onto the screen as Hitchcock aiming to seduce Grace Kelly back to Hollywood the teeth begin to rattle as memories of Toby Jones pouring out the definitive depiction of Hitch in The Girl diminish anything that Ashton Grifiths can produce. Amongst the supporting cast Robert Lindsay surprisingly cast as Aristotle Onassis and Derek Jacobi as Count Fernando D'Aillieres engage the eye but there is a very odd collection of accents on display for a film set in an annex of France.The production design is eyecatching and detracts momentarily from the clunky dialogue but it isn't sufficient compensation. Contrary to popular opinion Grace of Monaco is not a turkey. It is merely overlong and dull.

The script meanders about with one poorly conceived scene after the next. None even vaguely plausible. Do you think that people went around calling Rainier Ray and Grace Gracie? I think not. As for Nicole Kidman not for one minute does she look like Grace Kelly  or even seem to try. Kidman has red hair when Grace Kelly was one of the world's great blonds. Didn't anybody care? In addition Kidman's face is as waxy as a polished dance floor. In endless painful closeups Kidman looks like an ad for what can go wrong with too much Botox. She makes no effort to convey the famous Kelly breathy speech pattern. And while there are some beautiful gowns her hair is simply unlike the way Princess Grace wore her hair. Real jewels from Cartier  with a nice product placement leaving the Paris store  can't make up for this plastic performance.Tim Roth doesn't look like Rainier. Neither do the Onassis or Callas standins. But why bother?This is simply an insult to Monaco to the memory of Le Princesse Grace the craft of screen writing and the art of film making. This was jeered at its opening of the Cannes Film Festival. Rightfully so.".

She makes no effort to convey the famous Kelly breathy speech pattern. And while there are some beautiful gowns her hair is simply unlike the way Princess Grace wore her hair. Real jewels from Cartier  with a nice product placement leaving the Paris store  can't make up for this plastic performance.Tim Roth doesn't look like Rainier. Neither do the Onassis or Callas standins. But why bother?This is simply an insult to Monaco to the memory of Le Princesse Grace the craft of screen writing and the art of film making. This was jeered at its opening of the Cannes Film Festival. Rightfully so.";

	schema:headline " Messy at times ridiculous BioPic elevated by strong lead performance by Nicole Kidman";
	schema:reviewBody "The idea of my life as a fairy tale is itself a fairy tale Grace KellyGrace of Monaco Jesus it seems like it's been ages since i first heard about this movie i think the movie was already on post production by the end of 2012 and only at this year's Cannes Film Festival it finally premiered. Until that premiered much was talked about first Oscar buzz was all over this movie people seemed to see Nicole Kidman as a lock for the Best Actress category and since it was directed by La Vie en Rose director Olivier Dahan and with a powerful producer like Harvey Weinstein backing the movie up well it seemed like we could expect great things from it. This was until the movie was delayed from Cannes 2013 and the fights between the directors cut and Weinstein started and well this went on for basically a whole year with the movie being postponed several times and with a lot of controversy on top of it as well. The movie finally premiered at Cannes 2014 it was the opening movie and the directors cut was shown and the Weinstein name doesn't even appear on screen when the movie starts. The reviews bashed the movie many said that it was unforgettable because it was the worst Cannes opener they had ever seen. And although the movie has only been released for about a month everybody seems to have already forgotten it well i still had interest in seeing it i mean how bad could it actually be?Grace of Monaco is Directed by Olivier Dahan and it stars Nicole Kidman Milo Ventimiglia Paz Vega Tim Roth Parker Posey Frank Langella Derek Jacobi Geraldine Somerville and Roger Ashton Griffiths. The story of former Hollywood star Grace Kelly's crisis of marriage and identity during a political dispute between Monaco's Prince Rainier III and France's Charles De Gaulle and a looming French invasion of Monaco in the early 1960s.Well Grace of Monaco is not a straight up F movie the movie does have it's redeeming things but for a movie that had such big buzz for a movie that has such talent involvedin and out of camera i got to say that this is still an incredibly flawed movie and very disappointing indeed.I think this was a semiinteresting story Grace Kelly and Prince Rainier III relationship and her whole adaptation to the her new life was kind of an interesting story that could be told brilliantly and even earn some awards but this is not that story. I chose that quote from the movie The idea of my life as a fairy tale is itself a fairy tale because basically what the movie presents us is a fairy tale version of actual events the movie shows us a fairy tale that is quite ludicrous and naive at times but it shows us without being aware of what it is the story is presented in a very selfserious way. The movie's major flaw is really it's screenplay and direction the screenplay is totally insane it's plain stupid at times and basically the director takes this script and tries to make a kind King Speech biopic.Arash Amel's screenplay is really where it all begins it's an empty screenplay. So we have Grace Kelly who is having some problems in her marriage she feels to much pressure being a princess and she feels a disappointment Kelly is really the only character that at times pops out of the screen and it's really because of Kidman the rest of the characters have nothing to say and when they do the dialogue is dull and incredibly bland. Tim Roth Paz Vega Derek Jacobi Frank Langella are the supporting roles in this movie and their characters simply have no weight they are boring they really are just cardboard tick. This movie should never had gotten such talented actors for such a weak screenplay.And unfortunately the direction is not any better with Olivier Dahan giving violent shifts in tone at times the movie is very but very serious and it tries to focus on Kelly's problems as an artist and at other times it kind of becomes a comedy i mean not only because what's written it's ridiculous but because the approach is not the best either i mean even the score at times makes it feel like we are watching a comedy. The movie does hit a low point when all the the sudden we are not watching a BioPic nor a Drama or Comedy but a thriller with spies and sht it was at that time that threw the towel down because things had gotten a bit to ridiculous and the movie is really just all over the place tone wise. I mean i also have to mention that all those meeting scenes about whether or not there would be an invasion were really terrible too i mean just amateurish with no kind of tension or even believability.Nicole Kidman is a great talent and she rally gives her all here but even her was kind of hard to buy as Grace Kelly. She really gives her heart and talent to this movie that didn't really deserve it her performance is really what kept me watching this movie and she carries it on her back but even her was not nearly enough. The movie does look pretty good for the most part with some good cinematography and SetDecoration but i mean that is more or less expected from this kind of period piece.Grace of Monaco is quite a big fat mess although not as terrible as some said. This is a bad movie no doubt on that with a disgusting screenplay and direction that's out of hand still it's elevated by a good lead performance by Kidman who could not save the day.RatingC".

The film kept doing this thing where it would switch to sweeping hypercloseups of Kidman's face well parts of it as she emoted slightly. Very irritating and I kept saying What are you trying to convey Director? What? The script stretched credulity in almost every scene. But the final straw for me was the meandering selfserving speech the film's Grace presented at the Red Cross Ball a speech which we are led to believe averted a war between France and Monaco. Really? It was laughable and poorly presented and summed up the entire film for me a beautiful disappointment that made me yearn for a glimpse of the real Grace and her charm and beauty.

	schema:reviewBody "As predicted and along with the negative response the film received at Cannes this year Grace of Monaco bares little representation and is a lazy depiction of one of Hollywood's greatest film icons Grace Kelly. The picture takes us through a turbulent life in the principality's history as it faces a potential threat from France and the destruction of the tiny nation.As for Kidman's performance I was a little disappointed. Although not completely a tragedy Kidman is able to display some sense of emotion as the tiny principality faces a potentially devestational crisis from the French but for me she did not truly capture the essence and allure that Kelly seem to exude in her alltobrief film career. But the real question is did Ms Kidman actually capture the essence of the mystery and purity that was Grace Kelly. For me her performance did not seem to demonstrate that this was a Grace Kelly story it all. The accent sounded more American than British. Kelly's signature elongated smile was barely seen in the picture as Kidman's facial expressions appear unconvincing and constrained as she tries morph into the film icon in some way. However Kidman's scenes revolving around her potential return to acting with Hitchock's Marne did falsely allude that this film many have some serious potential. In the first half of the film we take a look at Kelly's possible acceptance of going back to Hollywood over the summer to shoot Marne and I think Kidman demonstrated Kelly's shear desire and longing to return back to what the world fell in love with her for and the clear choice Kelly has to make in fulfilling her Mongasque duties or to return to her first love the movies.There's no question the film is intricately and lavishly produced with beautiful serene shots of Monaco but the storyline is so facetious and lacks believability. Is it really appropriate to suggest that Ms Kelly saved Monaco from an invasion by France? Although the picture declares a mild disclaimer that the storyline is partly fictitious it does little to assist in deciding whether this picture is either a story or a serious biopic.It's deeply frustrating to see the full potential this film could have had with its lavish production and significant buzz around the awards season. It's almost as if the director failed to exploit a great TRUE story in what is one of America's greatest movie stars leaves it all behind at the very pinnacle of her career with an Academy Awardwinning performance to rush off to become a princess in a far away microscopic land to live happily ever after with a yearning desperation to return back to Hollywood when reality kicks in. It's like the film missed so many failed opportunities and focused too much on the FrenchMonaco crisis than providing a small backdrop to how this little Philadelphian girl became a world icon of class elegance and style.".

	schema:headline " Princess Disgrace";
	schema:reviewBody "Unlike that dreadful 1980s biopic with Cheryl Ladd Grace of Monaco does not aim to be a complete biography of Grace Kelly. It concentrates on one single episode in her life the dispute between France and Monaco in the early sixties when President de Gaulle angered by the number of French citizens who were avoiding taxation by using Monaco as a tax haven blockaded the tiny Principality and even threatened it with invasion. Possibly he wanted to win himself a place in the Guinness Book of Records as the victor in the shortest ever war in history. The film also deals with Grace's relationship with her husband Prince Rainier whom she calls Ray fluency in the language of her adopted country does not seem to have been her strong point and the search for a palace mole suspected of selling Monaco's secrets to France. Critical reviews of the film have generally been negative and in my view with good reason. For such a talented actress Nicole Kidman has a surprisingly large number of mediocre or downright bad films in her CV Far and Away Moulin Rouge Practical Magic Bewitched The Stepford Wives Batman and Robin and several others and Grace of Monaco is another to add to the list. Playing a famous actress from the past especially one who was famed for her beauty always poses special problems and although Nicole is herself strikingly attractive she does not bear a great physical resemblance to the woman she is portraying. It doesn't help that she is considerably taller than Princess Grace and also considerably older than the Princess would have been at this period. Her accent also seems wrong the real Grace Kelly had a very distinctive accent and some Americans even thought she was British. Some actresses in a similar situation I am thinking in particular of Michelle Williams in My Week with Marilyn and Helena BonhamCarter in Burton and Taylor have been able to convey the essential personality of their characters despite a lack of resemblance but Kidman's face has become so distinctive and familiar in its own right that it seems to be difficult to accept her as another reallife person. I was always too aware that I was not watching Princess Grace but rather Princess Nicole playing Princess Grace. Apart from Frank Langella as Grace's domestic chaplain Father Francis Tucker there are no memorable contributions from the supporting cast and Tim Roth makes a singularly dull and uncharismatic Rainier. His wife may call him Ray but a ray of sunshine he ain't. He is supposed to be one of the Crowned Heads of Europe but more closely resembles a harassed provincial businessman desperately trying to fight off a hostile takeover bid from a larger and more successful rival. The unsympathetic portrayal of de Gaulle struck me as yet another American dig at the Cheese Eating Surrender Monkeys so I was surprised to learn that the film was actually made by a French director Olivier Dahan. One thing the script seems unsure of is whether the Monaco of the early sixties was a rich country or a poor one. At times it is implied that the Monegasques are so impoverished that they cannot even afford to fund the local hospital properly. At others however it is also implied that the Principality is absolutely awash with money so much so that its government can dispense with a local income tax and that de Gaulle's aggressive designs on his little neighbour are motivated by the desire to secure all this money for France. I often think that a good test of factbased or supposedly fact based biopics is how well they would work as pure fiction. There is doubtless somewhere an alternative universe in which Grace Kelly never married Prince Rainier continued her acting career won a second Oscar for her role in Alfred Hitchcock's Marnie and today lives quietly in retirement with her husband James Dean. Let us suppose that in this universe some Hollywood screenwriter comes up with an idea for a film let's call it Tracey of Ruritania about the ruler of a tiny European kingdom who manages to save the day with the assistance of his glamorous American exfilm star wife when his country is threatened with annexation by a powerful neighbour. Such a film might work if made as a comedy along the lines of The Mouse that Roared but any attempt to make it into a serious drama would probably result in a dull and predictable soap opera. Well you and I live in the real universe not this alternative one so we are unable to see that uproarious comedy Tracey of Ruritania and have to make do with Disgrace of Monaco. Anyone going to watch the film with the idea that it will give them insights into the life of the real Grace Kelly is likely to be disappointed. All they will end up with is a dull and predictable soap opera which only differs from other soap operas in that its characters are supposedly based on real historical figures. 410 Some goofs. In a scene set in 1961 Alfred Hitchcock tells Grace in a reference to Sean Connery and James Bond that his leading man in Marnie will be a Scottish actor who has just finished making a spy movie. The first Bond movie Dr No was not made until 1962. It is also implied that De Gaulle's eagerness to take over Monaco is fuelled by the need to fund the war in Algeria. In fact by 1961 De Gaulle had already decided to grant Algeria independence something achieved the following year.".

	onyx:emotionText "Unlike that dreadful 1980s biopic with Cheryl Ladd Grace of Monaco does not aim to be a complete biography of Grace Kelly. It concentrates on one single episode in her life the dispute between France and Monaco in the early sixties when President de Gaulle angered by the number of French citizens who were avoiding taxation by using Monaco as a tax haven blockaded the tiny Principality and even threatened it with invasion. Possibly he wanted to win himself a place in the Guinness Book of Records as the victor in the shortest ever war in history. The film also deals with Grace's relationship with her husband Prince Rainier whom she calls Ray fluency in the language of her adopted country does not seem to have been her strong point and the search for a palace mole suspected of selling Monaco's secrets to France. Critical reviews of the film have generally been negative and in my view with good reason. For such a talented actress Nicole Kidman has a surprisingly large number of mediocre or downright bad films in her CV Far and Away Moulin Rouge Practical Magic Bewitched The Stepford Wives Batman and Robin and several others and Grace of Monaco is another to add to the list. Playing a famous actress from the past especially one who was famed for her beauty always poses special problems and although Nicole is herself strikingly attractive she does not bear a great physical resemblance to the woman she is portraying. It doesn't help that she is considerably taller than Princess Grace and also considerably older than the Princess would have been at this period. Her accent also seems wrong the real Grace Kelly had a very distinctive accent and some Americans even thought she was British. Some actresses in a similar situation I am thinking in particular of Michelle Williams in My Week with Marilyn and Helena BonhamCarter in Burton and Taylor have been able to convey the essential personality of their characters despite a lack of resemblance but Kidman's face has become so distinctive and familiar in its own right that it seems to be difficult to accept her as another reallife person. I was always too aware that I was not watching Princess Grace but rather Princess Nicole playing Princess Grace. Apart from Frank Langella as Grace's domestic chaplain Father Francis Tucker there are no memorable contributions from the supporting cast and Tim Roth makes a singularly dull and uncharismatic Rainier. His wife may call him Ray but a ray of sunshine he ain't. He is supposed to be one of the Crowned Heads of Europe but more closely resembles a harassed provincial businessman desperately trying to fight off a hostile takeover bid from a larger and more successful rival. The unsympathetic portrayal of de Gaulle struck me as yet another American dig at the Cheese Eating Surrender Monkeys so I was surprised to learn that the film was actually made by a French director Olivier Dahan. One thing the script seems unsure of is whether the Monaco of the early sixties was a rich country or a poor one. At times it is implied that the Monegasques are so impoverished that they cannot even afford to fund the local hospital properly. At others however it is also implied that the Principality is absolutely awash with money so much so that its government can dispense with a local income tax and that de Gaulle's aggressive designs on his little neighbour are motivated by the desire to secure all this money for France. I often think that a good test of factbased or supposedly fact based biopics is how well they would work as pure fiction. There is doubtless somewhere an alternative universe in which Grace Kelly never married Prince Rainier continued her acting career won a second Oscar for her role in Alfred Hitchcock's Marnie and today lives quietly in retirement with her husband James Dean. Let us suppose that in this universe some Hollywood screenwriter comes up with an idea for a film let's call it Tracey of Ruritania about the ruler of a tiny European kingdom who manages to save the day with the assistance of his glamorous American exfilm star wife when his country is threatened with annexation by a powerful neighbour. Such a film might work if made as a comedy along the lines of The Mouse that Roared but any attempt to make it into a serious drama would probably result in a dull and predictable soap opera. Well you and I live in the real universe not this alternative one so we are unable to see that uproarious comedy Tracey of Ruritania and have to make do with Disgrace of Monaco. Anyone going to watch the film with the idea that it will give them insights into the life of the real Grace Kelly is likely to be disappointed. All they will end up with is a dull and predictable soap opera which only differs from other soap operas in that its characters are supposedly based on real historical figures. 410 Some goofs. In a scene set in 1961 Alfred Hitchcock tells Grace in a reference to Sean Connery and James Bond that his leading man in Marnie will be a Scottish actor who has just finished making a spy movie. The first Bond movie Dr No was not made until 1962. It is also implied that De Gaulle's eagerness to take over Monaco is fuelled by the need to fund the war in Algeria. In fact by 1961 De Gaulle had already decided to grant Algeria independence something achieved the following year.";

Nicole Kidman's Princes Grace is just too innocent and pure to believe. She was tutored in survival in the notoriously competitive world of 'Hollywood' and her frailty in the House of Grimaldi comes across as too much of a 'puton'. Her passionate plea with Rainier telling him she would be equally happy just living with him and the children in a small country house was a hoot! Plus the teary eyed final speech is so pretentious and shallow it had me laughing out loud. LOL Tim Roth as Prince Rainier walks throughout his role like a nicotine addicted zombie!So I hope the one percent appreciate this patronizing kiss of a movie!

And it was a great idea for a movie. There are some slim historical facts to build this movie on. But between commissioning the movie and releasing it things went badly awry.The script is terrible. It can't decide if it is indeed a fairy story or a clear eyed look at the way people will undertake to do anything for the sake of their family. The characters of Onassis and Callas were clearly created to allow the exploration of the alternative possible dynamics that exist within a power couple and the sacrifices that female artists are asked to make. But it's handled so poorly that all we see are stereotypes acting out 1950s tropes. In places Kidman sounds like a character from a movie aimed at 10 year old girls in other places she just sounds like an actor reading her lines and working very hard to make them sound as if any person would say them.Other choices made are equally baffling. The soundtrack is overwrought and features many pieces of classical music that have become hackneyed by their inclusion in ad campaigns. The lighting is all over the place  I suspect there was a colour scheme tied to developments within the script but damned if I could work it out. It was decided at some stage before filming began that the actors could forget about accents  so a Monegasque count is British Rainier is American and Grace is Australian. Finally the directing is just dreadful as there are alarming framing choices made as the camera drifts on occasion from a close up of Kidman's eyes to her mouth back to her eyes maybe a zoom. Tedious and pretentious and not enough attention paid to crowd scenes which invariably had the look and feel of a crowd scene being created for a TV show on a tight budget.Tim Roth lacks that true leading man charm charisma and beauty that made Rainier of Monaco the heartthrob that stole Grace Kelly from Hollywood. And Nicole Kidman who should be luminous in the role does the best she can with her Australian accent. But when the events of this movie allegedly occurred Her Serene Highness Grace of Monaco was 31. Kidman was 45 and it makes a big difference. She lacks the bloom of those younger years the curves that made Grace Kelly the movie icon she is the youth that made her appear so young and vulnerable in those times. The Nicole Kidman who played Satine in Moulin Rouge approached the required physical requirements of the role as written. Kidman should have passed on this script and waited for the script that looked at Grace in the time coming up to her untimely death. That would be a movie worth seeing.".

	schema:headline " It is a missed opportunity rather than an aimless failure.";
	schema:reviewBody "By playing loosely with history and replacing facts with a generic character arc this film about the life of Hollywood starlet Grace Kelly and her relationship with Prince Rainier III of Monaco sinks. Is the film as terrible as you've heard? It isn't but that doesn't stop it from being artificial and outright boring at times. The reputation of this film by director Olivier Dahan has snowballed since it was in production. Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein wanted to recut the film to add more exposition and context to the film's political background. This was to the displeasure of the director who has described that version as a pile of st. The film was also heavily booed at the Cannes Film Festival and was lucky to be given a US release at all. There have been films released this year that have fewer ideas than this one and worse films will follow too. Yet unforgivably it fails to utilise the talents of Nicole Kidman and Tim Roth as Grace and Prince Rainier and by being a fictional version of real events as an opening title tells us it has no useful purpose for anyone who is interested in the true story. Dahan has said this isn't a biopic because he hates them but why did he have to reshape this particular story? The film's script by novice screenwriter Arash Amel who has written just one other feature lacks early clarity and resorts to a generic character arc to find its shape. The early scenes in the script involving Rainier's political struggle where he is fighting with Charles de Gaulle over French citizens in Monaco avoiding taxes are dull and convoluted. Without knowing any background information to this historical conflict the film is confusing and unenlightening about this historical context. According to the New York Times in real life this tension was resolved by Rainier agreeing that the people in Monaco would eventually have to pay taxes once he signed a treaty. This wasn't interesting for Dahan and Amel who attribute Grace to resolving the conflict herself. One truth covered here is that she did refuse Hitchcock's offer for the lead role in Marnie to remain as the Princess of Monaco. But the source of tension removing herself from her artistry and passion leads into a transformation as derivative as any underdog story. Grace is told that being the princess will be her greatest role yet and her character arc is defined by cheesy traininglike montages as she practices her royal etiquette and expressions. The form of this narrative is highly artificial in the transformation of its central character and near comical in the way it thrashes violently between a moody shadowy political thriller to a lighter ugly duckling tale. The casting is another disappointment for Dahan when his lead actress has few expressions to share with the audience. Nicole Kidman is committed and does share some resemblance to the princess even though she is older than Kelly was at the time. But her voice has never been her strongest facet and she doesn't fully mimic Kelly's accent. It is also problematic that in those moments where the camera is fixated tightly on her face and screams for variation that her forehead doesn't move as freely as her eyes or smile. Tim Roth is normally an eccentric and charismatic actor but here he is bland and heavyhanded as the prince who stands over Grace and is pinpointed as hindering any chance of her returning to Hollywood. Frank Langella as Father Francis Tucker Grace's mentor and Roger AshtonGriffiths as a gruff Hitchcock are only serviceable in small roles. On top of not drawing the best from the actors Dahan's stylistic work is inconsistent. The film has a dull air about it which he tries to rectify by overstylising shots and entire scenes with high colour saturation including white and gold tones. These colour motifs are to assert Kelly's belief that her life is like a fairy tale. Yet some shots like a long shot of Kelly standing at the top of the stairs with a red and white sash that matches the carpet and stairs seem selfconsciously artsy instead of adhering to an authentic period look. It is easy to be cynical about the film and suggest that it is merely a vanity piece film for Nicole Kidman to be cast as a classic Hollywood actress and princess. Perhaps there is an unfortunate reality to this but I also think that as a story about an actress whose career was overshadowed by a loveless marriage Kidman experienced parallels and a personal resonance with her own relationships through the film. In The Sydney Morning Herald Dahan referred to many similarities between the personal lives of Kelly and Kidman but was coy to express what exactly they were. Similarly if there was more honesty and emotion upfront in this film and less artificiality in the style and story structure this could have been a far more human and open look at a damaging relationship. It is a missed opportunity rather than an aimless failure.".

	schema:reviewBody "When you're buying a ticket to a movie called 'Grace of Monaco' then you are expecting a biopic right? However the movie starts with the message that this is a fictional story based on non fiction events. Those expecting a full run down on the rise and fall of Grace will be hugely dissatisfied the story chronicles a political dispute in Monaco about taxes. The director suggests that Grace had a critical role in the outcome of that dispute... but this might also be a fairytale on top of a fairytale that is probably the fictional part as mentioned at the beginning of the movie.If anything this movie does not demystify Grace it only adds to the legend now even accrediting her for solving a major historical problem in France.Probably would have been better anyway if the tax problem would not have been solved and President De Gaulle would have invaded Monaco because since then it serves as a tax free haven for drug lords and the super rich who would rather buy another Lambo or Ferrari rather then to pay the state for redistributing money.So to me it's puzzling why a mediocre actress who marries royalty in Monaco gets so much attention it's obvious that the charity goals of Grace are half baked because she chose to live in abundant luxury herself in a country which hosts mostly tax evaders. So presenting her as some kind of angel figure or a royal Mother Theresa is laughable at best.Kidman has a good run trying to mimic the angel like posture of Grace but the lines smother her with cheesy dialog and real drama is nowhere in sight. I missed 10 minutes because I fell asleep but was still perfectly able to follow the storyline... so don't expect any surprises. I asked my companion and he said I did not miss anything... so there you have it.".

Audiences will be divided because those who come wanting an overview of a dearly loved princess's ideal life will be disappointed. But for those wanting a film depicting a legend and her possible trials and tribulations through a short period in her life will find it fascinating. Oh and if your French I don't think you'll be happy but then it is told through American eyes. Watch out for McNamara's sickly throwaway line to DeGaulle late in the film.Kidman is lovely but plays Nicole as Grace. I'm not sure Grace had that wandering eyebrow though. Tim Roth plays the insignificant prince he's serviceable but not mesmerising. And then there are others but it is not their film. Now about the Hitchcockian style well that's the thing I don't want to give anything away! It's worth a look but don't get your hopes up !!".

Bit samey with the oldest child a teenage daughter who wears different clothes and wants to be rebellious...father works a lot and isn't the most committed father..mother who seems to do it all and has had enough and then the younger son who just seems to want to do his own thing but hasn't the nerve to say it. BUT apart from that the dog was great Tim Allen and Robery Downey Jnr were greatnice to see Downey in something some funny scenes with the actors and with the animals. Bit slow to start with but gets better. Def entertaining for kids and adults..if only Disney done more like this seem to have dome some fantastic films years ago and then lost the plot a bit. Worth seeing".

Bit samey with the oldest child a teenage daughter who wears different clothes and wants to be rebellious...father works a lot and isn't the most committed father..mother who seems to do it all and has had enough and then the younger son who just seems to want to do his own thing but hasn't the nerve to say it. BUT apart from that the dog was great Tim Allen and Robery Downey Jnr were greatnice to see Downey in something some funny scenes with the actors and with the animals. Bit slow to start with but gets better. Def entertaining for kids and adults..if only Disney done more like this seem to have dome some fantastic films years ago and then lost the plot a bit. Worth seeing";

	schema:reviewBody "Assistant D.A. David Douglas Allen finds himself barking up the wrong tree after he's bitten by a dog being experimented on in a laboratory and suddenly finds himself acting and the turning into a dog himself.Tim Allen's film career is a case of hit or miss. The Santa Clause movies are offset by Joe Somebody and Christmas with the Kranks. Unfortunately The Shaggy Dog is in the latter group. To be blunt the film is pretty bad. The movie was not funny and it was quite dull. I know it's just a harmless family film but did it have to be so boring and humorless? Of course it didn't. I always thought family movies were supposed to entertain the entire family not just one age group of the family. The Shaggy Dog may prove to be an enjoyable treat for the kids but most people over the age of 13 will probably hate it.The acting is only okay and the decent cast keeps the film from completely sinking. Tim Allen gives a decent performance as Dave but he really needs to stop doing lame family movies. Kristin Davis also gives a decent performance and she is also way above this material. I really don't like Spencer Breslin. He just annoys me and his acting isn't very good. The Shaggy Dog did not change my opinion about him. Zena Grey just gives a bland performance nothing special from her. Robert Downey Jr. gives a decent performance as the bad guy. Danny Glover is wasted in his role and he barely appears on screen.The first twenty minutes or so are actually pretty enjoyable. After that the movie starts reusing the same jokes and it becomes more serious. There was probably a break from the laughter for about 30 minutes since the movie was handling serious issues in a lighthearted way. I think the director did this to attract both adults and children but he ended up alienating both of them. The stupid humor will probably bore adults and the serious scenes will probably bore the children. I have never seen the original Shaggy Dog movies and maybe that's how those films were handled as well. However the film seemed a little misdirected to me which isn't surprising since there are five! credited screenwriters. Behind the camera it seems like things were a little messy and it shows in the movie. In the end The Shaggy Dog is a harmless yet humorless family film that should appeal to the kids. Everyone else should skip the movie. Rating 310".

Unfortunately all he has produced are animal mutations such as a king cobracanine with a tail a dogfrog that barks and other mutations that are part dog. The sheepdog escapes the lab and is rescued by Carly Douglas Zena Grey who takes him home. Deputy District Attorney Dave Douglas Tim Allen is prosecuting Carly's teacher for the firebombing of Dr. Kozak's lab. Dave hates dogs and after he is bitten by the sheepdog the dog is sent to the pound. The dog has injected Dave with some of his DNA cells and Dave begins to have canine urges and eventually becomes a sheepdog. Dave learns the truth about his family and the drug company as a dog.My Comment This is a cute movie that you can take your children to. There are several funny scenes like the bathroom and park scenes that are just hilarious. I think they wasted their money on the CG effects on the cat chasing scene. If you look at the Shaggy Dog poster you will see Tim Allen's eerie eyes. I enjoyed this movie and you must remember that this is only a movie and don't take the plot too seriously. Note The dog is actually a bearded collie. Walt Disney Run time 138 Rated PG 510".

He gets a hold of a magic Borgia ring and switches from being a sheepdog to a man. This remake is the same except they took out the magic ring part and replaced it with a thousandyearold magic Buddhist dog who bites the lawyer. Tim Allen as Dave Douglas is doing his usual comedic performing style and does a fine job at it. He's a deadbeat dad who learns to love his kids and become a better father by listening to his children as a dog. Kristin Davis is his wife Rebecca. Better known for her role in Sex In The City she's proving to be a versatile actress. Zena Grey and Spencer Breslin play the kids and they're good in this also. Robert Downey Jr as the scheming rival lawyer is also comedic and fun to watch. The film is good except it is ultimately a repetitive predictable Disney film. It is fun for the whole family however.".

Come on guys it is a movie about a guy turning into a dog! While not overly cheesy it still has some which is okay in a family movie. I'm glad to see Disney going back to family friendly movies that are just good fun.Other movies that my kids like are Freaky Friday and Cheaper by the Dozen.

Kristin Davis The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl is believable as the frustrated wife and mother.Zena Grey In Good Company and Spencer Breslin Cat in the Hat perform like old troopers but the stand out performance goes to Robert Downey Jr who excels as the neurotic nemesis.Like always this Disney flick earns 10 stars for clean family fun and an 8 for special effects but because of a weakness in the script the writers couldn't quite make up their mind why our star turns into a dog I must rate The Shaggy Dog a 7.".

	schema:headline " The Shaggy Dog is an OK family film but it's just too silly at times.";
	schema:reviewBody "I'll admit right off the bat that I am a fan of Tim Allen. I never really watched his television show Home Improvement but really liked him in films like Galaxy Quest Big Trouble and The Santa Clause. But when I saw the trailer for The Shaggy Dog I shook my head with disbelief. How could Tim Allen do such a stupid movie? I asked myself. But I figured I would give the film a shot because sometimes the marketing is very misleading and the actual film itself could be decent. So tonight I ventured to my local cinema to catch the 800pm showing of The Shaggy Dog.The Shaggy Dog is about a man named Dave Douglas Tim Allen who works for a big law firm in Los Angeles. Dave is a man that is so caught up with his work that he doesn't even realize he is ignoring his wife Rebecca Kristen Davis and his two kids Carly Zena Grey and Josh Spencer Breslin. Dave is currently working on the biggest case of his career which involves animal testing. If Dave wins this case he will become the head D.A. at the firm. But when a dog from the testing facility escapes and comes to the Douglas house. This is where Dave's priorities begin to change as Dave turns into a dog and sees his family and himself from a totally new and unique perspective.I'll be really honest with my review here and state that The Shaggy Dog isn't a great movie by any means. The story is silly and the film reminded me at times of the Rob Schneider film The Animal but is The Shaggy Dog as bad as the trailers lead you to believe? Not really. The movie had good intentions but was just poorly executed. The movie really is a feel good family flick but it isn't very original nor is it very believable.What The Shaggy Dog does well is it delivers a good message which is Be there for your family. What makes The Shaggy Dog fail is the fact that the film is so incredibly silly. I think the writers of this film tried so hard to make the film childish that it caused the film to be overly stupid at parts. The whole scene where Tim Allen chases the cat like a dog is really too much and wasn't necessary. I feel if the film took itself a little more seriously instead of trying to be constantly funny the final product would have been much better.But that's not saying that the film is a total disaster like I thought it would be when I walked into it earlier today. It was a decent family film and kids under 10 will probably adore it but parents will probably beg for it to become a little less goofy. The movie itself was a decent silly film that could have been executed better but instead turned into a very average family film.Tim Allen actually does a decent job here although as I mentioned before not as good as he could have done. This is probably my 2nd least favorite film of his the first being Jungle to Jungle which was also made by Disney. His performance was just a little too over the top here and it seemed like he was trying too hard to be funny. The family members on the other hand did a good job. I liked the roles that Kristen Davis Zena Grey and Spencer Breslin played and I felt that they all did a pretty good job. Also Robert Downey Jr. wasn't bad either as the evil mastermind. Overall the cast was a lot better than the actual film.Brian Robbins was the director of this film and I feel that this is where the problem with the film lies. A director has total control of the film and I think Brain Robbins still doesn't have a good director touch yet. Robbins has brought us several bad movies including Good Burger Ready to Rumble and the absolutely dreadful The Perfect Score. So looking at his previous experience I can see why The Shaggy Dog wasn't an excellent movie. The problem here is that he isn't that good of a director and that's why this film wasn't exactly good. I would think that he would have caught on by now but he is still missing the bar on what it takes to direct a good movie.In the end I didn't hate The Shaggy Dog like I thought I would have. It's a passable family film that kids under the age of 10 will probably love. Being a fan of not only Tim Allen but family films in general I was disappointed with the outcome of this movie. It had some redeeming elements to it but not enough to save the lame script and the poor directing. If the movie didn't try so hard to be funny it probably could have been funnier. I wouldn't recommend this movie as a full price ticket at the local cinema but it's an OK matine or DVD rental.MovieManMenzel's final rating for The Shaggy Dog is a 610. If you have young ones take them because they will love it even if you feel it's a bit too much at times.".

He's a lawyer you see and his current big case involves an animal research company who make poodles into frogs or something like that. Their goal is to make the elixir of everlasting life so naturally one would make a poodle into a frog to achieve such a noble ambition.Dave is bit by one of the dogs and now is infected with dogness. This causes him to periodically turn into a dog and 'hilarity' ensues as he tries to keep up his case and maintain his family life. Why on earth would you want to see this? Tim Allen has already played a neglectful dad who learns important lessons after undergoing a weird metamorphosis in 2 Santa Clause movies so he's not broadening his role much. And how many movies are there with bad dads always the dad and never the mum eh? who are usually lawyers who learn the same crap? About 86 billion!I can understand why Tim Allen is in this as he is constantly scraping the bottom of the sludge barrel but how the hell did they get Robert Downey Jnr Danny Glover AND Philip Baker Hall do to this? They must owe their bookmakers a fair whack. No one in their right mind could read this script and find it worthy of their talents.So not only does the story stink of the worst clichs but it's woefully misjudged and badly directed. The scene where Mrs. Douglas confronts her dog husband and hears him bark 'I wuff woo' is pretty much the most disturbing scene I've ever come across. And I've watched snuff. When they look into each others eyes I seriously thought she'd start making out with him.And when the film finishes...is Dave still going to turn into a dog? Is he cured? Who knows? Do I really care that much? Why? Why do I do this myself? If you really hate life then see this movie. If you are of sound body and mind then save the pennies for guns drugs and ill hookers.

The movie was entertaining and it also nice to see Robert Downey Jr. back in action. Take your kids the special effects were great. Seeing Tim Allen change into a dog and back was hilarious.

The movie was entertaining and it also nice to see Robert Downey Jr. back in action. Take your kids the special effects were great. Seeing Tim Allen change into a dog and back was hilarious.

Earlier collaborations between comedian Tim Allen and Disney including The Santa Clause and Jungle 2 Jungle were always hilarious.

This isn't Tim Allen's funniest movie and this isn't the most vibrant remake of The Shaggy Dog but it does manage to be at least mildly amusing all the way through and at times it's even hilarious.Tim Allen plays a deputy D. A. prosecuting an animal rights activist accused of torching a laboratory in which cruel experiments were allegedly performed on animals. What Allen's character doesn't realize is that a villainous scientist played by the always brilliant Robert Downey Jr. who has appeared in such films as The Singing Detective has kidnapped an eternally youthful and extremely shaggy dog and is performing particularly inhumane experiments on it. The dog escapes and bites the deputy D. A. causing him to periodically and temporarily morph into a shaggy dog in turn allowing him to get closer to cracking the case and get closer to his family his son Spencer Breslin who has already worked with Tim Allen in The Santa Clause 2 his kinda cute daughter Zena Grey and his definitely hot wife Kristen Davis.There are two levels of humor in this movie. Young children will love Tim Allen's goofy physical humor. Older audiences should appreciate the more subtle tricks Tim Allen uses to make his human character seem increasingly doglike. There are also some nifty computer generated effects including a series of intriguing mutant animals. There is one special effects trick that is uncalled for however ridiculous cells that resemble dogshaped clumps of grass that bark and pant their way through the main character's blood stream. These brief scenes take a lot away from the movie which isn't anything to howl about but is still entertaining and not a dog by any means.".

I found it to be a fun romp into a world that we so often see the high society end of Dangerous Liasons etc.. but not too often from the poor man's point of view. Robert Carlyle and Johnny Lee Miller are two of my favorite actors both since Trainspotting and I think they will be for some time to come.

A refreshing change in these days of Merchant Ivory productions and heynonny snooze.Then there's the obligatory love interest Lady Rebecca Liv Tyler and the vicious baddie in the form of the Thief Taker General Chance played with sadistic relish by Ken Stott.  Both perform well but it's up to the two leads and the chemistry that worked well in Trainspotting to steal the show.  Being Highwaymen they steal it with ease commanding each scene with humour and grit in equal proportions.  Some moments of the film are laugh out loud funny while others border on the disgusting.  Always funny and compelling as an action movie the love story is left firmly in second place Plunkett  Macleane is great fun.  Though the efforts of the excellent cast and director Jake Scott we have another British hit on our hands.All in all to blatantly rip off a line from the filmIt was fantastic and I had a bloody good laugh!".

Most of the time this sort of approach doesn't work in films just look at Batman Forever but I was was pleasantly surprised to see that in this case they pulled it off.The end result is a highly entertaining film that should appeal to most mature cinemagoers. However the weak of stomach should really be warned of one or two scenes. Robert Carlyle and Jonny Lee Miller pull of a brilliant double act and Ken Stott does a excellent villain. This mixed in with superb costumes and a few decent action scenes makes for a very enjoyable watch.However the big letdown here for me is that in having 'The Gentleman Highwayman' there was a real opportunity for some good dialogue but the script was definitely lacking in punchiness and there were few belly laughs. Okay so the lines weren't terrible but to me it does highlight a problem with recent British films ignoring a few notable exceptions the screenplays being written today are still relatively mediocre when compared to some of Hollywood's efforts.".

Not the greatest film ever made I'll admit but it is a huge amount of fun and I would recommend to those who enjoy other gritty Brit flicks.

You can't help but fall in love with the hilariously quirky characters especially Rebel Wilson as the irrepressible Fat Amy Elizabeth Banks as Gail the sexually frustrated female announcer and Hanna Mae Lee as Lilly the wackadoo who releases the most shocking comments in a voice that barely exceeds a murmur.

It has the loner girl who doesn't want to try new things but then she gets involved with a group and she has friends yay! The girl falls for the guy but she screws it all up but don't worry they get back together in the end. The group starts out terrible but then because of the new girl with fresh ideas they step up and win it all! So many eye rolls in one film!Even after this the worst part of the movie has to be the awful sound mixing. The songs are so doctored that one is painfully aware of the actors' lip syncing and it takes you right out of the movie. They could have at least tried to make it sound like the songs were being recorded live rather then using so much auto tune and other forms of voice manipulation. Then there were the plethora of jokes throughout that fell so flat it hurts. Some of those jokes were even repeated multiple times because once wasn't bad enough. At least Rebel Wilson provides a few brief moments of relief from the onslaught of worn out and unfunny jokes.But like that's just my opinion. If you like terrible things like Glee then you will probably love this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "The single best thing I came away with after watching this movie was the wild relief I felt knowing that at least I didn't pay to subject myself to it. Some positive wordofmouth made me curious enough to DVR it. An 81 rating on Rotten Tomatoes got me to sit through the whole thing albeit with a fair amount of time spent pressing fastforward just to see if there was something  ANYTHING  that could justify such an absurdly high score.Short answer There wasn't.I'm given to assume it got its high rating only because the studio wouldn't allow any critics to screen it without first producing proof that they possessed an IQ of 70 or under.If you read the IMDb synopsis you know the whole movie. Actually if you've ever seen any film starring characters under 25 you know the whole movie. There is not a single unique idea to be found within a light year of its sorry script. Comparisons to Glee are inevitable but the truth is PP is so utterly dull and witless so aggressively devoid of joy or humor or anything akin to real human feelings it makes the worst episode of Glee look like Singin' In The Rain by comparison.Ostensibly a comedy the film is mercilessly unfunny. Their idea of hilarity seems to run the gamut from projectile vomiting to juvenile puns like a singing group called The Minstral Cycles to inserting aca into every exclamatory phrase like Acascuse me?! and Acabelieve it!. Isn't that funny?! Aren't you just gasping for breath from the amusement of it all? ...Yeah me neither.The characters who are either grotesque shopworn stereotypes or dull cardboard cutout caricatures flap about from scene to scene without ever even accidentally bumping into a real human attribute or emotion. They're also supposed to be in college but the movie is so bent on regurgitating teen film tropes that nothing they say or do is indicative of a person over 15.You know your film is bad when you feel compelled to reference other better films to move the story along or motivate your characters. For Pitch Perfect that other better film is The Breakfast Club which the 2D heroine's wouldbe 2D boyfriend regards as the most meaningful thing ever. There's a scene where said heroine she had a name but really who cares? is sitting on her bed watching the flick on her laptop tears welling up in her eyes to indicate some grand epiphany ...which under the circumstances must be her devastated realization of what a GOOD teen movie looks like.In sum this is a film I'd recommend only for use as a torture device on terrorists. Badly written directed and acted with characters as irritating as a rash and music numbers so awful even the editor's attempt to slice them into bitesized bits couldn't make them any more palatable. Funny only for people whose sense of humor atrophied at age five and entertaining only for people who've never seen a movie before. I give this a 1 only because IMDb does not allow me to score in negative numbers.".

For many this movie will definitely be enjoyable. Make no mistake that does not make it any less of an awful movie.Several factors contribute to my low opinion of Pitch Perfect. The largest of these concerns is the cast of characters. While there are few complaints in the acting department the characters themselves are among the worst set of people committed to screen in recent memory.Beca is that spelling supposed to be hip or something? is an arrogant brooding selfish brat who spends most of her time sulking on her computer and complaining about being forced to go to COLLEGE and be with PEOPLE blegh right?!. This is a perfect setup for character development right? Wrong. After a halfhearted apology for being a terrible human being before the climax Beca morphs not into an upstanding social and moral butterfly but a smug leader of the troop she so recently was kicked off of and this is the image the audience is left with.Jesse is the most clich love interest one can imagine. Seriously girls if you ever meet a guy this perfect and blameless marry him. Jesse prances throughout the movie being sweet to everybody from his unrealistically nerdy roommate to the jerks he sings with. He pursues Beca valiantly for no particular reason and provides the clich moral criticism Beca so desperately needs late in the movie but of course he takes her back. While girls might be enthralled by this sentiment no true development can occur through a character who is so blatantly onedimensional.Worst of all are the two commentators for the singoffs Gail and John. These two buffoons spew dialogue that is not only shockingly inappropriate for televisionradio they simply aren't funny. While clearly trying to channel Fred Willard's comedic performance from Best in Show the pair instead come across as amusing as your drunk middleaged parents at a frat party.Other character highlights include the mindbogglingly narrowminded and stubborn team leader Aubrey. Stacie provides the necessary collegeaged sexaddicted tramp character a character so overthetop you're guaranteed to squirm. Bumper the captain of the boy's singing team is a character so insanely arrogant and rude that he is not only hard to enjoy watching he makes you want to kill every jock on the planet. Slowly. The movie's second fatal flaw is its achingly stupid sense of humor. Yes boys and girls Fat Amy is funny. She has several good one liners and lends the movie its only spark of humorrelated vitality. However all else falls flat. The most achingly obvious example is the vomitladen climax. Seriously was that girl doing vomitangels supposed to funny? I guess I just don't get it.Also for a PG13 flick aimed at mostly female tweens Pitch Perfect is surprisingly offensive. The movie takes heavy jabs at nerds Asian people Jewish people redheads and probably more that I fail to recall at the moment not to mention several distasteful jokes like the one about eating another baby in the womb. Seriously filmmakers you aren't Sacha Baron Cohen and you don't have the same audience. Finally the movie follows the most clich I like this word don't I? storyline imaginable. Girl has trouble in college. Girl meets boy who befriends her. Girl joins team of hasbeens. Girl pushes away boy away because of her past and her daddy issues. Girl forced off team. Girl learns lesson and wins boy back and helps team of hasbeens win championship. Yay ingenuity!Ultimately the comedic sparks from the humorous character Fat Amy can not save Pitch Perfect. I'll be honest this movie completely lost at the vomit sceneeven Miss March was more tasteful than that! I was quite acathankful when the movie came to its very abrupt ending.".

Intentionally or not the characters come across as very whitebread and narrow minded. At first I though they were denigrating anyone who was different as a way of highlighting that such behaviour is wrong. But actually I think the script is genuinely making fun of anyone who's not a blonde bimbo or jock. Anna Kendrick is sweet but too serious for the lead role of Beca. And her character is too dark. The plot is air thin  guys you've got to give the audience something a bit meatier to chew on. But all that seems to happen is that a group of shrill young women stand around messing up their rehearsals. The End. Great teen movies like Bring It On and Ten Things I Hate About You have some depth and meaning and feeling to balance the goofiness. This movie is pure sugar and that's not good for you.".

	schema:reviewBody "Pitch Perfect is certainly a wildly popular movie that came highly recommended by countless friends and family. I had no idea what it was about beyond 'singing' so I fired up the DVD player at Chteau Pulpitel and eagerly awaited the many laughs I was assured this film would provide.Now they never really came. This film is as best I can gather 'Glee The Movie' with the basic plot elements of your 'Bring it On' style films. So if you love any of that stuff stop reading now and go watch it. You'll love this film so you needn't bother about my opinions.Okay it's just us now right?Where this movie falls apart is in two aspects firstly its complete disinterest in logic pertaining even to its own universe and more worryingly it has an offensive attitude that is nothing short of racist sexist and more suited to your standard right wing attitude in its portrayal of nonCaucasians Jewish people people with eating disorders and women in general. This movie doesn't care about what happened before or why something is happening now. It's one big Deus ex machina from beginning to end. Why did Ben Platt's' character Benji turn up as stage manager at the regional sing off event? Everyone else had to drive on the bus to get there. Where was he? Why was he a stage manager at another university when he is a freshman amateur magician? Why was it that the best way to get rid of Adam Devine's' character Bumper was to have a hastily created scene with him immediately leaving to work with John Mayer negating any interest in his relationship with Rebel Wilsons' appallingly offensive and unfunny Big Amy character? Why does no one EVER study? THey don't even carry books or pens or seem to talk about their subjects! This movie shows us countless avenues of interest and then never refer to them again. It sets up characters and dumps them never to be seen again. We are shown four acapella groups one of which NEVER does anything at all! Why bother with all of these settings if you never refer to it again? Because no one cared that much would be my guess.More shamefully however is the constant prejudicial attitudes displayed in this film. This movie attempts to be funny by being daring and outrageous. So we get not one but two Asian characters who are simply awful stereotypes. One is a racist angry dorm mate with the main protagonist who manages to be an unlikeable bitchy Asian stereotype. The other is a 'crazy Asian' stereotype who is a pyromaniac who rolls around in vomit. You know because Asians can't be complex and meaningful. They are either bitchy nerds of perverts. We aren't allowed to hear nonwhite characters speak too much either our token black character gets around 4 lines you can't count the singing because its all clearly auto tuned and added in post but gets to be a problem gambling lesbian. But there's no motivation given no reasoning. And after the moment of confession NO ONE CARES. Maybe it's because she is black? The script writers were right to think that you can do great joke about racist stereotypes but they missed the concept that you make fun of the behaviour and attitudes of racism and expose the ridiculousness of it. What they do here is reinforce stereotypes which should not be amusing for empathetic caring members of the human race. But we plough deeper into this morass with obesity bulimia and deafness copping a serve. I strongly feel that no subject is off limits for humour but you need to be funny. Making fun of Deaf Jews Lesbians and Asians is not the same as being funny.I found this to be a fairly heartless film where morality and heart are irrelevances and not one that I could recommend to others. This is not what comedy should be if we're a truly civilised people.".

	schema:headline " What Glee Wishes it Could Be.";
	schema:reviewBody "Pitch Perfect is basically Bring It On but with a cappella singing groups instead of cheerleadersand it's also a million times funnier. Directed by Jason Moore and adapted by Kay Cannon from Mickey Rapkin's novel Pitch Perfect tells the story of Beca played by Anna Kendrick an aspiring DJ attending Barden University who's hobbies include seclusion nonconforming and listening to Mashups which kind of makes her a conformist. In an attempt to have Beca become more socially active her father who is also a professor at the University urges her to join a club on campus. But upon perusing each club especially the glee clubs she quickly decides that the loner lifestyle is far less humiliating. That is until a rather awkwardly nude runin with one of the members of the The Bellas an allgirl a cappella group on campus that sings nothing but Ace of Base. And since The Bellas are coming off of an embarrassing loss at the previous year's singing competition Beca as well as a multitude of other a calosers including Fat Amy as advertized and Lilly the girl who can apparently speak no higher than a whisper are asked to try out in a desperate hope that a group of misfits could be just the thing that sends the conservative Bellas all the way to the finals of the national Gleeesque competition. And if this doesn't sound generic enough there is also a love story subplot centered around Beca and a guy who looks shockingly like Dane Cook. OK so if this sounds like every teen flick that you've ever seen about a misunderstood misfit who ends up helping the popular kids that were mean to her in the beginning of the movie win their somethingorother championshiptournament only to discover that in the end that they are all the same no matter their social standing then that is only because from synopsis alone Pitch Perfect is exactly that. But before you write this dark horse off let me just say that due to a sharply satirical script and a surprisingly hilarious eccentric and immensely engaging cast which include the likes of Brittany Snow Hana Mae Lee Rebel Wilson as Fat Amy Skylar Astin and Anna Kendrick giving a performance which not only solidifies herself as a true leading lady in any genre but also as the new Kristen Bell but with talent Pitch Perfect does elevate itself far above the mundaneness of your everyday teen comedy. In fact from the nonstop laughs to the quite satirical teenage dialogue to the perfectly hilarious Best in Showesque banter from Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgins who play the two commentators of the national a cappella competition Pitch Perfect aside from a curiously abrupt ending works on EVERY level even in its rarest of sappy moments.Pitch Perfect vs. Glee The main reason Pitch Perfect works so well is actually quite simple. Where Glee is so in love with its selfproclaimed perception that glee clubs are the new cool this is a comedy that isn't afraid to make fun of a cappella groups glee clubs and people randomly breaking out into song while at the same time presenting interesting characters that audiences want to root for. So if you where thinking of avoiding this film on the basis of your dislike of Glee or that awful show The SingOff but find yourself being dragged to see it anyways no need to worry because chances are you will be happily surprised by what Pitch Perfect has to offer.Final Thought Even though most of the comedy here is on the cruder side this is still a PG13 venture. In short Pitch Perfect is not the raunchy female buddy comedy filled with overlong skits about feces that Bridesmaids was. But good newsPitch Perfect is so much more funny and more importantly more accessible than Bridesmaids will ever be. What I mean by accessible is men will be able to watch this movie without hearing the phrase You wouldn't get it because you're a man. All kidding aside I haven't seen a comedy with this much clever teenage personality since Easy A. So in the comedic cesspool that has been 2012 filled with halfassed attempts such as That's My Boy and The Watch Pitch Perfect is not only my pick for the biggest surprise to come out of the genre this year but also the funniest movie of the year so far narrowly edging out 21 Jump Street.Written by Markus Robinson Edited by Nicole I.

But before you write this dark horse off let me just say that due to a sharply satirical script and a surprisingly hilarious eccentric and immensely engaging cast which include the likes of Brittany Snow Hana Mae Lee Rebel Wilson as Fat Amy Skylar Astin and Anna Kendrick giving a performance which not only solidifies herself as a true leading lady in any genre but also as the new Kristen Bell but with talent Pitch Perfect does elevate itself far above the mundaneness of your everyday teen comedy. In fact from the nonstop laughs to the quite satirical teenage dialogue to the perfectly hilarious Best in Showesque banter from Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgins who play the two commentators of the national a cappella competition Pitch Perfect aside from a curiously abrupt ending works on EVERY level even in its rarest of sappy moments.Pitch Perfect vs. Glee The main reason Pitch Perfect works so well is actually quite simple. Where Glee is so in love with its selfproclaimed perception that glee clubs are the new cool this is a comedy that isn't afraid to make fun of a cappella groups glee clubs and people randomly breaking out into song while at the same time presenting interesting characters that audiences want to root for. So if you where thinking of avoiding this film on the basis of your dislike of Glee or that awful show The SingOff but find yourself being dragged to see it anyways no need to worry because chances are you will be happily surprised by what Pitch Perfect has to offer.Final Thought Even though most of the comedy here is on the cruder side this is still a PG13 venture. In short Pitch Perfect is not the raunchy female buddy comedy filled with overlong skits about feces that Bridesmaids was. But good newsPitch Perfect is so much more funny and more importantly more accessible than Bridesmaids will ever be. What I mean by accessible is men will be able to watch this movie without hearing the phrase You wouldn't get it because you're a man. All kidding aside I haven't seen a comedy with this much clever teenage personality since Easy A. So in the comedic cesspool that has been 2012 filled with halfassed attempts such as That's My Boy and The Watch Pitch Perfect is not only my pick for the biggest surprise to come out of the genre this year but also the funniest movie of the year so far narrowly edging out 21 Jump Street.Written by Markus Robinson Edited by Nicole I.

A lot like Glee minus the cheesy factor mixed with witty comedy like in Bridesmaids and other modern popular comedies. Great casting! Any college girl is bound to love it. This is a movie even my mom would enjoy. It held my interest throughout and i think it was well produced. My boyfriend even enjoyed the comedy aspect of it! A great girls night out movie choice or even a date night movie. I feel like overall everybody loved it I definitely did. I hope this movie earns the recognition it deserves.

That is how awful and stupid this movie is. The only 2 good things about this movie are the Universal logo and when this movie finally over. Although I haven't really sat through this piece of crap I'm still giving it my review y'all could hate on me but I don't care. Okay so yea I've only sat through like half hour or so but I had to turn off the TV because it was really stupid and unrealistic in terms of college and probably the worst movie of 2012 that I've seen. This movie is not funny it's stupid and inaccurate when it comes to being in college. The students in the movie are not even carrying any books around so what do students do in the movie? Do they learn anything? Another thing the selection of music. The selection of music in this movie is absolutely horrible I hate modern pop it's really stupid and overrated and they only played that in this movie and with People in this movie messing it up even more now it's even more annoying now and then they try to rap to a throwback from the 80s or 90s wow really why? That's my jam there and they just messed it up with their annoying ass auto tuned singing voices. Plus this movie is not funny it's dumb annoying and overrated critics why are you giving this piece of crap so much credit that it does not deserve at ALL? That goes for people too that suck this movie's dick. Seriously the score for this movie is too high a 7.2 is way too high for this movie . I'm not even gonna bother finishing this movie half hour is already a lot of time wasted on this bullcrap okay Fat Amy is not funny at all people I didn't laugh at her jokes once because there stupid and unfunny to me and all the rest of the humor in this damn movie is dumb and unfunny. I do not recommend this movie If you like stupid ass overrated movies or crap like Glee or anything like that you'll like this one but otherwise if you do have common sense do not waste your valuable hard working time your time is much much more important than this movie. I would NEVER pay money to even get this on DVD. So yea people don't watch this movie this movie sucksand is stupidly overrated and overhyped. Well people if you get mad at me you should be grateful that I'm saving you from wasting your valuable time from this movie. Well anyway this it people bye have a great day. Please do not your waste your time on Pitch Perfect it is so absolutely God awful.".

In fact the music is terrific and I can't wait to download the entire soundtrack.I was expecting slapstick comedy especially with Rebel Wilson in the cast but Pitch Perfect rests at the borderline. Speaking of Rebel this movie would be nothing without her. Hilarious lines mixed with her perfect comedic timing equals a workout for your abs. It comes very close to stupidity but it doesn't quite cross the line.Pitch Perfect is cute silly and fun. If you're looking for some laughs take a watch. I give it a 7 out of 10.".

Pitch Perfect centers on Becca played the emerging star Anna Kendrick in a role which will solidify her status if it its as big as it deserves  a freshman at college. Her father is a professor and she's angsty and rebellious. After a brief set up we enter the unknown world of acapella singing Which is singing with no instruments. Apparently a huge thing at this college and we meet different groups there well 2 mostly the troublemakers an all male group that always slays the competition and the Bellas who churn out the same old fashioned nonsense and are recovering from a year that didn't end well to say the least. After some persuasion Becca joins the Bellas looking to add some of her much needed zest to liven up the competition.I'm sure you can guess what happens and it's no lie that the film is formulaic in that way. However the approach to the material is what differentiates it. It's handled with an original saucy smart originality. it doesn't downplay it's focus but instead celebrates it in all it's corny glory. The film takes a little getting used to but about half way through i was so sold on all the wonderful characters and the films undeniable charm. Filled with exciting musical numbers and solid performances from Anna Kendrick Rebel Wilson as Fat Amy the adorable Skylar Kenstin as Beccas love interest and so many others Pitch perfect is something truly special. Not to say t's flawless it's a little amateur in spots and Brittany Snow's character feels a little confusing. But it's easy to overlook the small stuff when the film is so entertaining.".

	schema:reviewBody "Once again I find myself in the minority but acabelieve it  I didn't enjoy Pitch Perfect. Pitch Perfect has no storyline. It is a droning Cinderella story minus the charm and based on that knowledge you won't be surprised when the Barden Bellas yes that's their real and extremely uncreative name finally pull out a win in the college acapella contest against their sworn enemies after the proverbial mean stepsister gets out of the way. It has some corny quotes some of which are funny but can easily be dug up on Pinterest or IMDb. You'll find the same amount of amusement in just reading them and you can skip the crude humor and barfing scenes too! Many PG13 films I have watched are rather mild and the upped rating is primarily a marketing tactic. This is not one of them. There's some pretty risqu content in this one so NO Pitch Perfect is not a cute and harmless movie about a collegiate singing contest. Neither is it really about college or going to class but maybe Barden is just a hangout for disenfranchised and clichd misfits and not really a location for education. Fat Amy is somewhat likable but the rest of the onesided characters are nearly excruciating to watch. Characters are supposed to be the center of a movie in which there is no action and all I got was a bunch of singing contest commentary and a headache from the absolute meaninglessness and vapidity of this film. I'm disappointed. Unless you are trapped on a bus and forced to watch this movie like yours truly was you can easily skip it. Even if you are trapped on a bus and forced to watch this movie just look out the window and listen to the music instead. The music is kind of enjoyable. However nothing will beat your own pair of headphones or some earplugs.".

Many PG13 films I have watched are rather mild and the upped rating is primarily a marketing tactic. This is not one of them. There's some pretty risqu content in this one so NO Pitch Perfect is not a cute and harmless movie about a collegiate singing contest. Neither is it really about college or going to class but maybe Barden is just a hangout for disenfranchised and clichd misfits and not really a location for education. Fat Amy is somewhat likable but the rest of the onesided characters are nearly excruciating to watch. Characters are supposed to be the center of a movie in which there is no action and all I got was a bunch of singing contest commentary and a headache from the absolute meaninglessness and vapidity of this film. I'm disappointed. Unless you are trapped on a bus and forced to watch this movie like yours truly was you can easily skip it. Even if you are trapped on a bus and forced to watch this movie just look out the window and listen to the music instead. The music is kind of enjoyable. However nothing will beat your own pair of headphones or some earplugs.";

The script unfolds expertly and does a great job of drawing you into the storyline and the very believable characters. It's extremely funny in a lowkey way with most of the humor coming as a quick comment delivered deadpan.  It's the sort of flick where all of the characters are great because they're so quirky that they are funny in and of themselves.  The overall message of the movie is also a good one.

In a way this movie from writerdirector Lawrence Kasdan is like that.  A lot of people have complained at how slow moving this is but it's all the better for it to sneak up on you.  And instead of just providing quick fix solutions for his patients Mumford just gently prods and nudges until they find the path for themselves.  Of course this may just be an elaborate way of saying Physician heal thyself but that may be the point.If you look at this in one way you might think Mumford is merely a passive character who only comes to life when he falls in love and when his secret is revealed.  But gradually you come to realize what's going on.  Not only is his reticence a covera good one until he's exposed but it's a way of as I said just gently prodding his patients to the right path.  So he is active but just in subtle ways.  You need a subtle actor to handle that and Loren Dean does quite a good job in that department.  Hope Davis who if there's any justice in this world will become a star is also good as the patient he falls in love with.  Their scenes together reminded me of the relationship between William Hurt and Geena Davis in THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST a Kasdan film this shares a lot with.  And the rest of the cast is quite good as wellit's also nice to see Elisabeth Moss so good in IMAGINARY CRIMES still getting work though I hope it's bigger roles in the future.My only complaint was the scene where Mumford explains to Jason Leealso excellent and us what his past really was.  The details themselves were okay but the sequence was shot in grainy video stockI think I'm not an expert here which while it pays off later is distracting here particularly with its pointofview camera.  Still this is a minor quibble for a movie which will leave you with a big smile on your face the entire way through.".

	schema:reviewBody "Of all of the comments to date Jotix describes this film best. It is very reminiscent of some of the work of the great directors of Hollywood's Golden Era Frank Capra Ernst Lubitsch and Preston Sturges. I cannot imagine categorizing this film. It is not a pure comedy although it provides moments of cleverness and humor. But there is also a significant element of dramatic tension. It is certainly no intellectual tour de force however it is much more than a way to while away 100 minutes or whatever the length of the film is. It is not a morality play although you might find something meaningful to take away with you. It is a finely crafted subtly nuanced multifaceted film mirroring its title character. You might conclude from other opinions that Mumford the character is passive out of timidity or lack of purpose or even in order to preserve his anonymity. However I believe he is passionate about his profession and has a very clear philosophy and purpose. I think his therapeutic prescriptions for his patients represent sympathetic compassionate and very intentional interventions in their lives. However his persona is lowkey and his methods of intervention are indirect. Thus their dramatic impact seems to be just the natural consequence of the patients' living their own lives  just as the good doctor intends.This kind of subtlety is in short demand and hence supply in the contemporary world of inyourface computer generated special effects one dimensional characters and unimaginative dialog. But if you enjoy films like Grand Canyon The Accidental Tourist Local Hero and Passion Fish you'll like this film. It is driven by a great balance of plot and well developed characters played by a wonderful ensemble cast.".

It is very reminiscent of some of the work of the great directors of Hollywood's Golden Era Frank Capra Ernst Lubitsch and Preston Sturges. I cannot imagine categorizing this film. It is not a pure comedy although it provides moments of cleverness and humor. But there is also a significant element of dramatic tension.

	schema:reviewBody "Lawrence Kasdan has never been known for his comedy persay. He is perhaps best known as the screen writer on the best Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Empire Strikes Back as well as his own The Big Chill. Mumford may be the most representative of his talents. It is widely agreed that Kasdan was brought into the Star Wars and Indiana Jones movies to add a bit of humor to the films. This is most noticeable in the change from Raiders of the Lost Ark to the Temple of Doom as 'Temple' is not nearly as enjoyable as Raiders as it is missing much of the wit that has become a tired action clich of late. Kasden has some of the back and forth in this movie with smart responses that make you smirk. But most of the movie centers around the plot which is about a man named Mumford that no one seems to know much about but everyone talks to. Throughout the film Mumford helps his patients realize what they need which seems to be their only problem. Occasionally he takes an active role but often all he does is listen. Loren Dean plays the role with a carefree attitude that wouldn't work in most films but fits right on the money here. His indifference makes him the perfect person to talk to. The supporting cast especially Hope Davis Alfre Woodard Jason Lee and Mary McDonnell are outstanding although a lot of attention was paid to casting and you can tell. Everyone seems to fit their role well. Mumford doesn't have gutbusting laughter or moments of pure hilarity it rather trucks along in a more traditional idea of comedy and sendback to the old days of comedy when people cared about atmosphere and character. The biggest achievement of this movie is that nothing is said to take you out of the feeling that you are watching real people which is a hard thing in comedy these days. The movie doesn't make a huge impact and if I weren't so in love with it it would be quite forgettable as it probably is to many people. However it is the only movie in a very long time where I left the theater smiling because I had been emotionally moved. And that's the most impressive thing of all.".

Mumford is the name of a small fantasy town filed with smiling people greeting each other on a daily basis which is held in upheaval when a small time psychiatrist's true entity is revealed to his various patients.I am getting ahead on myself here. Before I can explain what happens after the characters discover the secrets about Mumford the name of psychiatrist also I must first give you some background information on the characters. The mismatched characters are eccentric and entertaining. They are developed though sessions with Mumford. To make things even more original for the movie is the lack of plot structure here. The conflicts problems and solutions all exist in each individual character not necessarily a situation they are placed into. With Mumford included here are the characters Sofie Crisp Hope Davis who is nearly bedridden after a severe and almost permanent loss of energy. Henry Follett Pruitt Taylor Vince whose mind is overflowing with wild and erotic sex fantasies but he isn't featured in any of them. Skip Skipperton Jason Lee a young skateboarding corporate billionaire that is so lonely and without friends that he has spend the last several years designing robots to fit individual's sexual pleasures. Nessa Watkins Zooey Deschanel who has social smoking relationship and obsession issues. Lionel Dillard Martin Short a lawyer who's disturbing images Mumford refuses to listen to. Jeremy Brockett Ted Danson who is great to himself but treats his family members like dirt. Dr. Ernest Delbanco David Paymer and Dr. Phyllis Sheeler Jane Adams the only other two mental health doctors in Mumford who question Mumford's creditability. And finally there is the Mumford character himself played by Loren Dean who has such a compelling flashback sequence developing his entire life in five minutes effectively we learn that this man also had some problems he just was willing to turn his life around. This character alone makes the film worth while to see for his mysterious past life is such a revealing subject that it is hard not to become intrigued. There is much to like about Mumford. There are the enormously entertaining characters who are not puppets of the plot but contain their own personal emotions and motives. A charming imaginative atmosphere. The direction by Lawrence Kasdan is focused and organized he seems to know exactly what he wants and achieves it. The personal territory the film's story covers a psychiatrist mind as well as the thoughts of many disturbed individuals is quite compelling.  Also I think there is an important message here signifying the need of people to communicate to one another and how important it is to listen to each othervalues everyone should have. The conclusion to Mumford  contains no big extravagant climax. Nor does it completely bring the film's message to a direct close. It is a happy petty ending in which almost everyone goes home happy but still lets the imagination wonder. This ending only provides the fact that this is a character and mood movie not a plot based movie. It ends how it needs to end assuring this film will stick with the viewer for sometime to come.Brought to you by Touchstone Pictures.".

Mickey Mumford and his highly unorthodox techniques are extremely successful but things begin to change and get complicated when he takes Sofie Crisp Hope Davis on board as a client and falls in love with her while trying to cure her sleep deprivation. 'Mumford' written and directed by Lawrence Kasdan The Bodyguard The Big Chill is a surprisingly great film. Really this is just a very welltold story. Dr. Mumford's curious cases pull the film along but those fragmented stories really wouldn't have been enough for 99 minutes so when the film's big twist comes midway it's a smooth transition from examining Mumford's patients and their crises to watching the problems of the doctor himself and the way's he tries to deal with them. Loren Dean while not the typically charismatic protagonist is oddly interesting as the humble and odd psychologist and really does communicate a very relaxed persona making it easy to see why people feel the need to confide in him. Zooey Deschanel is a great little secondary character totally at ease and entertaining in her role as the offbeat misfit. My one complaint may be that the love story between Dr. Mumford and his patient Sofie isn't executed very well there really isn't enough screen time given to the development of their budding feelings and in fact most of their realizations about their feelings for one another come either offscreen or are explored individually like when Dr. Mumford talks about his feelings for Sofie with patient and friend Skip Skipperton. Furthermore there isn't much chemistry between Loren Dean and Hope Davis. Between Davis's sleepdeprived baggyeyed divorce Sofie and Dean's stonycalm Dr. Mumford the romance is lackluster at best. The film is only 99 minutes long and I wish it was longer with more emphasis and development on the DeanDavis romance. I really enjoyed this film and was very glad I found it while looking through Zooey Deschanel's filmography. It's just a shame not more people know about it.".

How rare to find an American film these days that is so totally lacking in violence and melodrama while displaying such heart and humanity. What I love about Kasdan is the respect and compassion he shows for his characters foibles and all. As the song goes If anyone should ever write my life story........

	schema:reviewBody "I was appalled when I saw that this movie had a budget of 28 million yet it only did 4.5 at the box office. A shame. Kasdan cast the movie almost perfectly and everything else was superb as well. Superoriginal storyline about people starting over again photographed beautifully and deadon direction. Loren Dean is not a wellknown actor but he should be...and he should get more work than he gets. His performance is flawless although at times it seems that he lacks energy...but maybe that was the way Kasdan wrote the character. Jason Lee is at his usual best...just listening to that guy talk I realize how perfect his diction is. He makes the most out of the funny dialogue. Alfre Woodard plays the town cafe owner Lily jeez I wish I had a neighbor like her! A young Zooey Deschanel does great as the town's bad high school girl who Mumford sees pro bono or as she says pro boner? If there is any weakness to Mumford I'd have to say it comes from Hope Davis. Her early scenes with Loren Dean are good and convincing but as the story progresses it all just seems to slip. By the end it's as if she's really forcing the dialogue badly. Martin Short Dave Paymer and the supporting cast are great including Ted Danson playing a rich idiot and Jason Ritter playing the stepson who hates him. Dana Ivey playing Hope Davis' mother is so rotten you can almost smell her! At a slightly long running time of 1 hour and 46 minutes the audience definitely gets the entire picture of life in Mumford. Seems like a great little town.".

Among the people he helps there is Sofie Crisp a young woman suffering from depression and some sort of fatigue syndrome that renders her unfit to live her life to the fullest. With Mumford's help she begins her daily walks as she gains confidence and opens up to see what is out there.The film opens with a black and white sequence that is a fantasy being played in the mind of Henry.

There is also the young millionaire who is one of the richest men in the country because his firm produces modems for computers and who doesn't care to show his eccentric side for all to see.Mumford's cover is finally revealed when an episode of the television program Unsolved Mysteries in which he is showcased. The town of Mumford instead of condemning him rallies in its support of a man that has done more in his humble way to help the community in spite of his deceit.Mumford is a delightful movie thanks to Loren Dean who plays the title role. Mr. Dean does a wonderful work. Hope Davis is also a charming presence in the picture. The large supporting cast has some brilliant faces in it Alfre Woodard Jason Lee Mary McDonnell Pruitt Taylor Vance Martin Short Jane Adams David Paymer and Ted Danson among them.The film's success belongs to Lawrence Kasdan whose brilliant take on a man who is a fake but who has seen into the hearts of the people he has decided to settle in.".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched 'Mumford' again recently. It has been years since the last viewing. It has held up very well it is still a good movie. All of the criticisms about it in comments have been wellfounded. It is slowpaced and evenpaced. That is both good and bad. There was a preview for 'Gone in 60 Seconds' on the video tape that showed a franticpaced movie that probably did better at the box office but I will bet was not as well written or as wellacted Angelina Jolie is in 'Gone...' need I say more about the acting quality? Pace may get your adrenaline flowing while your sitting in your seat but it doesn't do anything for your brain cells. Mumford engages you intellectually.It is challenging to the viewer to believe that a billionaire computer mogul  skateboarder can practically own a town and move about as freely and anonymously as he does in this movie. Jason Lee is just the person to have that role though. He portrays the eternal adolescent in a lot of movies it would be difficult to watch him play an assassin or a pederast he picks the roles that he can handle and as a reward he now anchors a very successful sitcom.The pace and some credibility issues aside this movie is a pleasure to watch. Everything about the movie shares a harmony with its subject which is basically psychology. I read somewhere that Dr. Melfi Lorraine Bracco on the Sopranos was recommended to psychiatristsintraining as the model for a focused listener which is what a shrink is. Mickey Mumford Loren Dean is right up there with her as an exemplary professional when it comes to listening. In contrast Dr. Melfi is even a little too tense and rigid in keeping with her character to Lorraine Bracco's credit as a fine actress. Mumford is simultaneously relaxed and alert really I could watch him sit still forever and be endlessly fascinated by the blink of his eyes there is a scene where he acknowledges the sexiness of his young patient Nessa with the faintest of smiles and a slow blink an absolutely stunning expression with almost no movement in his body language. I think I developed quite a crush on Loren Dean just watching him sit across from his patients. Because the character Mumford is so brilliant he can be forgiven his few lapses in professionalism. When we first see Mary McDowell come into his office he has just told Martin Short to leave his office and never come back.

	onyx:emotionText "I watched 'Mumford' again recently. It has been years since the last viewing. It has held up very well it is still a good movie. All of the criticisms about it in comments have been wellfounded. It is slowpaced and evenpaced. That is both good and bad. There was a preview for 'Gone in 60 Seconds' on the video tape that showed a franticpaced movie that probably did better at the box office but I will bet was not as well written or as wellacted Angelina Jolie is in 'Gone...' need I say more about the acting quality? Pace may get your adrenaline flowing while your sitting in your seat but it doesn't do anything for your brain cells. Mumford engages you intellectually.It is challenging to the viewer to believe that a billionaire computer mogul  skateboarder can practically own a town and move about as freely and anonymously as he does in this movie. Jason Lee is just the person to have that role though. He portrays the eternal adolescent in a lot of movies it would be difficult to watch him play an assassin or a pederast he picks the roles that he can handle and as a reward he now anchors a very successful sitcom.The pace and some credibility issues aside this movie is a pleasure to watch. Everything about the movie shares a harmony with its subject which is basically psychology. I read somewhere that Dr. Melfi Lorraine Bracco on the Sopranos was recommended to psychiatristsintraining as the model for a focused listener which is what a shrink is. Mickey Mumford Loren Dean is right up there with her as an exemplary professional when it comes to listening. In contrast Dr. Melfi is even a little too tense and rigid in keeping with her character to Lorraine Bracco's credit as a fine actress. Mumford is simultaneously relaxed and alert really I could watch him sit still forever and be endlessly fascinated by the blink of his eyes there is a scene where he acknowledges the sexiness of his young patient Nessa with the faintest of smiles and a slow blink an absolutely stunning expression with almost no movement in his body language. I think I developed quite a crush on Loren Dean just watching him sit across from his patients. Because the character Mumford is so brilliant he can be forgiven his few lapses in professionalism. When we first see Mary McDowell come into his office he has just told Martin Short to leave his office and never come back. He is calm about it but he insists that he doesn't want to see him in his office again and Mary McDowell is witness to that speech. As he brings her into the office he comments about Martin Short 'Jeez what an asshole!' and Mary McDowell laughs delightedly as we watch her back while she heads towards the couch.

The manner in which he listens to the many people within the little town is mesmerizing and insightful and the citizens he encounters and assists are varied and beautifully sculpted vulnerable human beings. The fine cast includes Hope Davis Jason Lee in one his finest roles Mary McDonnell Alfre Woodard Zooey Deschanel Martin Short David Paymer Kevin Tighe Ted Danson Jason Ritter and even more.The dialogue is introspective healing edgy and entertaining and the overall feeling left with the viewer at the end of the piece is one of wishing more 'Mumfords' would be around our neighborhoods  or rather that we all could become 'Mumfords' with a little conviction and concern for our fellow beings.

It isn't due to it's intelligence and passion.  A very worthwhile movie. Even if you're turned off by the idea of subtitles don't worry.  There is a lot of English.";

	schema:reviewBody "When the Brazilian Government is overthrown by a military uprising the result is a dictatorship over the people. With protests violently broken up on the streets armed struggle is seen as the only solution and leads to the formation of the 8th October group MR8. Desiring direct action Fernando and Cesar join the group and are trained in weaponry and the likes. However during a bank job Cesar hesitates to kill and is shot and captured by the police while the others flee. It is this that gives Fernando the idea to kidnap the American ambassador in return for the release of 15 captured revolutionaries and bringing the events to the attention of the world. This film tells the story of the fourday hostage situation in the midsixties.I'm not a particularly wellread person and there is a lot of history even recent history that I am simply not aware of and this includes the events and times presented in this film. For that reason I cannot really comment on the accuracy or level of detail containing in this telling but what little I have since gleamed from other sources tell me that it is pretty fair and close enough to being accurate. The plot is well told and is made interesting by the attention paid to the people involved in the situation the drama and tension comes from them rather than false action sequences or standoffs. The thanks for this should lie with the cast but also with the script that creates the characters and makes them 'real' meaning we find it easier to understand them and feel for the positions they are in. The historical context is well done and I did find it very easy to get engaged in.The characters are where it is at and they are all very 'human'. We are never made to totally root for them because of what they are doing but we are helped to understand why they are doing this and how hard it is for some of them to actually turn their words into action. Cardoso does this best and he is the real heart of the film and easily the most sympathetic character. He has good chemistry with Arkin who does well acting in a foreign film. Torres does well to gradually soften her character as the film goes and it makes her more interesting than she was early on. Support is all pretty good with no really weak performances anywhere but the film mostly belongs to these lead three. The direction is good capturing the feel of the period early on where stock footage blends seamlessly into the main film and producing tension without overdoing the style over substance.Overall this is a pretty good film telling a straight story using the characters to drive it forward and involve the audience. The film has tension but it comes from the people involved and the situations they face in the attempts to do the 'right thing'. The script delivers the characters to the actors and the actors are convincing in their delivery producing an engaging and interesting film that helps deliver historical relevance in a miniature story.".

	schema:reviewBody "I didn't learn any Portuguese but from this movie I learned a bit about Brazil though Four Days is mostly in Portuguese. I have a hard enough time with Spanish thanks. This film offers insight into a part of South American politics that I frankly have little knowledge of and I didn't follow at the time I mean the parts in the movie's epilogue during which I was alive and aware and for that alone it is worth watching. Even if you don't care the movie will bring it to light so you can imagine the Brazil of the 1960s and you just might care that you learned something about it.Four Days manages to carry the viewer through to the 1989 end of the military regime in its epilogue. The Soviet Bloc was falling apart at about the same time the Berlin Wall if I recall came down that year so I suppose many would have missed this interesting ploy for attention by revolutionaries for that reason which I certainly admit to having following the Soviet departure steadily and having no idea about this Brazilian event.The movie is a telling of when eager Brazilian Communistleftist revolutionaries both innocent and veteran take the U.S. Ambassador hostage to draw the attention of the world toward Brazil and to challenge the Brazilian powers they hope to overthrow ultimately with demands for releasing their compatriots. I thought it was a convincing movie though coming up short on making the characters particularly compelling. But then the event was the focus not the characters. Alan Arkin was terrific. So was the actor who played the central character the young not too tough glasseswearing Fernando. The show didn't hide behind the revolutionaries either. We saw things from the other side too. It was believable and I really enjoyed the handling of both sides of the coin in this reallife drama. There was a smoothly presented bit with a regime torturer and his girlfriend wife? where he suddenly admits to her what he does for the government. He'd claimed he was doing something much milder for some time and finally outs himself as a member of the secret service. He rationalizes his torturing college kids to prevent a breakdown of Brazilian society almost convincingly but his lady doesn't buy it and neither should the audience. The scene was meant to put a human face on the bad guy and did it reasonably but we also get that hisrationalizing leaves even him a bit flat as he tries to embrace his woman when she turns away from him in distaste. Most of the film is spoken in Portuguese and I didn't mind reading this movie a bit. It's when a movie that wouldn't be enjoyable in any language that I mind reading my way through it. This is a movie worth seeing for its attention to a daring moment in Brazil's move toward democracy. And even if you don't care about that it is a terrific suspense film.".

Frankly here in the States we know very little about the country and many people I know think they speak Spanish there! It's sad and those who DO know a bit about the country get it from films like City of God! Because I am a history teacher I was thrilled to learn more about the political turmoil in Brazil in the 1970s and their military dictatorshipas I hate to admit it my knowledge of the country is lacking. And for me the most surprising thing about the film was to learn that this government was in place all the way until 1989! Wow.As for the film it's a recreation of the evens leading to and following the abduction of the American ambassadorwith a strong emphasis on the motivations and reactions of the younger members of this Communist group MR8. Aside from a case of very capable Brazilian actors American actor Alan Arkin is on hand as the ambassador. Overall the film is excellent for many reasons. The script and direction are very good without a lot of politics and without a strong bias and the acting very good. In fact I have no real complaints about the film though I wonder about the further adventures of MR8the film really had me wonder about the decades following this kidnapping.By the way though the film is about communist revolutionaries the film is handled in a relatively dispassionate way and can be enjoyed by anyone regardless of their political orientation. It did seem to paint these leftists somewhat favorably but not in a manner that seemed overly sentimental or biased. Plus it did show the characters on the right as wella smart move in the long run. Well worth seeing.".

Fernando comes up with the plan to kidnap the American Ambassador Charles Burke Elbrick Alan Arkin. They seek to exchange him for 15 prisoners.I like the mix of characters in the revolutionary group. Each character is well defined and fully complete. It's not that much of a thriller despite a few action scenes. It has some psychological aspects.

Fernando comes up with the plan to kidnap the American Ambassador Charles Burke Elbrick Alan Arkin. They seek to exchange him for 15 prisoners.I like the mix of characters in the revolutionary group. Each character is well defined and fully complete. It's not that much of a thriller despite a few action scenes. It has some psychological aspects. It's really the interactions within the group and with Alan Arkin that is the most interesting.";

It doesn't have the vicious coolness of Tropa de Elite or the unusual camera movement and storytelling of Cidade de Deus. In fact it's a pretty classicallooking movie with a delicate straightforward story reserved camera angles and little visual spectacles. But it has a great heart and a better story.In the '60s when Brazil is living under a dictatorship a group of young men and women decide to create a revolutionary group to capture the world's attention about the atrocities being committed in their country. Because robbing banks and kidnapping Generals won't break the press' wall of censorship they decide to aim at a bigger target one which will have worldwide repercussions the ambassador of the United States in Brazil.The filmmakers are making a movie depicting one of the worst episodes in the history of Brazil and yet they manage to find an evenhanded way of showing the flaws of both sides. If the regime comes across as brutal employing torture techniques and repression the revolutionaries come across as sometimes heartless and willing to do anything to bring attention to their cause.Although the cast was great in general I loved Alan Arkin's performance as Charles Elbrick the kidnapped ambassador. He portrayed fragility coolness under pressure and even dignity. I wish he could have had a bigger role and more lines in Portuguese which he managed to speak quite perceptibly.In many ways this movie reminds me of Gillo Pontecorvo's The Battle of Algiers another balanced examination of the two sides in a war for independence. I loved the subplot about a policeman who questions the use of torture in his job and the way it messes up his personal life. But believing in the cause of defending his country against what he sees as terrorists he has no other alternative. It's a fascinating look into the other side.All in all Four Days In September is a great political thriller reminiscent of the '70s thrillers slow paced reserved rife with ideas and some good suspense. Anyone who loves movies like The Day of the Jackal The Three Days of the Condor or The Conformist will surely love this Brazilian gem.".

The best of those an inner monologue from the always admirable Alan Arkin as he composes a more banal note to his wife at the behest of his captors.As a result we get a film that is not too preachy nor too confined by what actually happened the bane of many a true story come to screen. Of course here what actually happened had inherent high drama. But the key for me getting into this film was that all of those portrayed are done so with at least a semblance of a conscience. Arkin's ambassador is just beautiful that and his English helped me to identify with him immensely. His fate is definitely in the balance.But the captorsrebels and even the police in pursuit of them all have this sense of contrition and concern about what they are doing. There are interesting dynamics among the rebels as well. On a couple of levels you feel a fuse burning slowly throughout the entire film.Hmmm I'll have to ask my friend or you can tell me what the real title of the film means. Is it something like O What is this companero thus speaking to the doubting conscience of all involved?? Other oddball afterfacts Stewart Copeland was somewhere in the soundtrack didn't leap out when I watched it for better or worse. Also I see that the director was also responsible for Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands hmmm not a good sign even as a horny teenager I was leery of that sex farce. I may be wrong but I suspect this docudrama will age much better than that.6.510".

The characters are interesting and the acting is good.Nevertheless the focus tends to be on the supposed heroes and not reality itself. The director even addresses the real issues behind the guerrillaterrorists groups but not with very depth.It is a very well known fact nowadays that those groups were not fighting for democracy but were actually fighting to instate a communist dictatorship. Some old guerrilla membersterrorists even came out on youtube claiming this was really the truth behind their intentions.The supposed heroes are also not so noble as the film portrays them. One of them became senator and somehow avoided being charged with international drug dealing. He got caught with over a kilo of marijuana seeds. He probably bought his way out based on corruption an unfortunately common issue in Brazil. Another one of our heroes became State Minister but was involved in nepotism. Apparently the guy pretty much hired his entire family for important jobs in the government favouring his family against the law. He pretty much fell in discredit after that.So my point is much of the actual facts are portrayed by the intelligence officer. His claim was actually true. They were torturing people and using questionable methods to avoid an even worse communist government. And these communist groups most of them affiliated with the Cuban dictatorship based their actions on using young naive Brazilians as cannon fodder. The bad thing is that even though this is mentioned it is not explored in depth.All in all the movie is really enjoyable and worth watching.".

This movie should be seen for everybody that wants to know a little about Brazilian history.

The primary actors are musicians and their songs tie the movie together and tie you to them. Although the primary cast aren't actors as a first profession they are very natural together and the film flows very well because of it. Everyone involved in this film has a great passion for music and it is very infectious. It is one of the few films I have seen in 7 years at Sundance that received a standing ovation. From the Sundance film guide A Dublin busker who ekes out a living playing guitar and repairing vacuum cleaners for his dad's shop meets a young Czech immigrant who sells roses on the same street. She likes his song and what's moreshe has a broken vacuum cleaner! They soon find themselves playing music together in a nearby music store since she can't afford a piano the owner lets her play his floor models. Over the course of a week they form a musical rapport and newly inspired decide to record an album. Once may loosely be classified as a musical but it has a refreshing vrit inflection. Conceived by director John Carney as a video album it sports a scrappy unembellished naturalism. Carney took a risk in choosing professional musicians over professional actors but Glen Hansard of the wellknown Irish band the Frames and Marketa Irglova a Czech singersongwriter are not only remarkably charming together but they're equally adept with the more melancholy shades Hansard's lonely soul stuck on an old flame Irglova struggling to support a mother and daughter. Burdened and brokenhearted their musical bond is the heart of the film and of their love. Great music aside what makes this film special is how little effort it seems to exert.

I have included the Fox Searchlight website for the movie at the bottom of this review so you can hear the music. So now I know that is was made in 17 days and at a cost of less than 150K and reflects a Dublin of 1015 years ago when Dublin was much poorer and more working class.And I would be much poorer in life and spirit and my heart like most of us covered in scar tissue from life would not seem so vulnerable and new if I had not seen this movie. A simple story of a street musician in Ireland singing covers during the day for Euros and his own music at night for cents. A verging on middle aged man still living with his Da repairing vacuums in a tiny shop and writing songs to his lost love in his tinier bedroom. Approached by girl an immigrant who loves his songs understands the pain that gave them life and soon they are in a music shop with the girl playing the piano and together they prove that art isn't produced from big budgets or green lit by ten vice presidents and that seventeen days and a pittance can make me get goose bumps just trying to write a review of what I saw in a dark theater with ten other people in a complex dominated by Shrek Pirates and Spiderman.I knew a woman once who only read novels about unrequited love. What a wonderful phrase unrequited love. Archaic unrequited love universally known and unknown and as a friend said about the movie and its songs no great art came from happiness. But the movie isn't sad it's pulsing with life and music and incident and the process of how art is made. I have always been a sucker for movies about how art is made Shakespeare in Love Topsy Turvey as examples but in both those art that was known. In Once on the streets of Dublin an Irishman and a Czech girl remind us of how to my generation the guitar was king a guitar bass drums and piano a symphony orchestra and there was no power like the power of rock and roll. In all generations love sought found lost and sometimes regained is the stuff that brings us to the theater to the book to the movie.I'm in the midst of reading a book by an Irishman a detective novel the hero a reader and the author uses the book to list books he likes from one...'the body moves on the mind stays and circles the events of the past.' This must be true of the writerdirector.You won't forget these people. I can't forget their songs. We should all meet my movie loving friends and talk about this movie in a bar in Chicago I know that has great music on the jukebox cold cold beer and is dark enough so we would all look good. Neil Young sang only love can break your heart Once asks 'how often do you meet the right person' and as fellow movie goers I ask how often can the right movie be made shown in your local and breakmake you heart at seven of a beautiful summer's eve? It's the best movie of the year. Maybe of the last five years. But I am not a dispassionate critic I loved it.".

	schema:reviewBody "From the moment ONCE begins it is clear that the experience about to be had is unlike any you've had before. A busker sings for his dollar in the street. The quality of the image is grainy the steadiness of the camera is shaky at best. The day turns into night and the song goes from bright to dark. The passion with which it is sung is almost overwhelming and suddenly borders on off putting. From the manner in which the busker is framed it isn't clear whether anyone is there to hear his song but his fervor brushes skepticism aside and declares that the song itself and the satisfaction derived from singing it outweigh the importance of having someone hear it. But someone is listening after all. A young woman from the Czech Republic stands transfixed before our busker on this Dublin street and a spark ignites the flame that gives ONCE its warmth. WriterDirector John Carney removes all convention from the movie musical and creates a film that reads like a wellwritten love song about two musicians falling in love with each other and the music they create together.In the early 90's Carney left his rock group The Frames to pursue a career in filmmaking. The Frames continued on without him and new lead singer Glen Hansard eventually took leave to search out new musical ventures moving from Dublin to the Czech Republic. Here he met Marketa Irglova a classically trained pianist and they developed a project entitled The Swell Season. Though the two are not linked romantically their meeting and the music that came out of that became Carney's inspiration for ONCE. During the week that follows their initial meeting on the street the two artists who are never referred to by name in the film learn to accept that they are inexplicably drawn to each other. Given the chance a relationship between the two could become one that would help each other grow. He would make a great father figure to her young child and she would drive him to make something of himself. Though ONCE's tone is simple these two characters' lives are not. He has a girlfriend in London he longs to be with but feels he cannot out of obligation to his father in Dublin while she is still married to an estranged husband whom she is unsure she has a future with. The trick then becomes to remain in the moment with each other and never allow for their relationship to go where it naturally feels it should.Albeit a modern approach to a movie musical ONCE is not so modern that it leaves the music behind. Instead the music becomes the catalyst for love. She is first drawn to him by the sound of his song. He sings it with such passion that it gives her a direct view of his soul. It is not all who are able to show such vulnerability yet when the song ends he trips over his spoken words and nothing comes out as it should. At first she almost seems a nuisance to him. It isn't until he hears the beautiful music she can make with her hands that the glimpse of her soul captures all his attention. Theirs is a mating ritual carried out in song. When one sings or plays the other listens. When one cannot express the proper sentiment in words it is music that gets the point across. When the two find themselves alone in a local musical instrument shop they learn what it means to sing together. In order to do so they must truly listen to the sound of the other's voice and fall into the same pace and rhythm of their notes. Their voices as it turns out are the perfect compliment to each other. The harmony they create leads into a song that is itself a representation of the love between them both fragile and pure.The delicate chemistry between Hansard and Irglova is framed in such a stripped fashion that it only further serves to concretize the genuine sincerity between the two. Almost entirely hand held and lit only with natural light ONCE seems less like intricate filmmaking and more like layered storytelling or perhaps more appropriately song writing. Put simply ONCE is like a perfectly soft song played acoustically in a park it seeps into your soul soothing you as the sun beats down upon your smiling face allowing for all cynicism to melt away while your reaffirmed belief in love is sung from your mouth.".

	schema:reviewBody "If the original lead actor Cillian Murphy hadn't dropped out at the last minute this movie probably would have felt extremely melodramatic and clichd but Hansard's spoton authentic portrayal is amazing mostly due in part to the fact that he isn't really acting but playing himself. There is also a beautiful scene involving the lead actress trying to write the lyrics to one of his songs as she is walking home from a convenience store that illustrates the creative process on a realistic level that I have never really seen done before on film. Amazing that this film was made for 150000. The fact that they didn't have a lot of money actually in my opinion helps make the film that much better. There are elements of naturalism and realism working in this film on levels that are sorely missed in today's mainstream cinema. Anyone who loves music andor learning about the creative process of writing will thoroughly enjoy this small gem of a film. The wellwritten script also surprisingly manages to NOT take the predictable road one might expect when making a film of this nature which is an extremely tough task to begin with. You'll know what I'm talking about after you see it.".

And even more refreshing is a script that never once beats us on the head with information but lets us hear the characters not only in the songs in fact the lyrics are not on the nose as they generally are in musicals but instead simply add nuance flavoring the script but in what they don't say and in the choices they make without exposition and explanation.I didn't notice any of the technical flaws people have mentioned. Any lack of polish in the camera work only added a hint of realism to me as if it were my eyes instead of the camera watching this vignette as a warmly invited guest. Little time is spent showing us unnecessary views of the city or vistas to long after. It could be anywhere in the world because the world is reduced for a few days to what's important to these two people and we fall for them as they fall for one another.The film does have an ending it's not left up in the air contrary to some comments here  but it may not be the one everyone wishes for or has been conditioned to expect.More than one person including folks commenting here have said the same thing What a lovely film . . .".

I know I know  totally different films  but the zenlike feeling after seeing them both...From a Dublin dweller it was fun to watch the geography as the film makers played with the locations in that certain venues were on the same street  yet it looked like the actors had to walk through town to get to them. It definitely hindered the 'who do I know in the public street' shots moments! But was interesting as helped make Dublin be a different city to what the residents would be used to.My recommendation is to just go and see it if you're on for seeing something uncomplicated feelgood without being too mushy comedic moments that everyone can relate to and some singersongwriter music thrown in.".

	schema:reviewBody "Once the Audience Award Winner at this year's Sundance Film Festival is a gem of a movie. I had the pleasure of seeing the film last night at the Tivoli Theater with the film's leads and director in attendance. Hoping for great word of mouth they are touring around the country with their film answering audience questions and performing songs from the film.Once is a musical but not as you might expect. There are no scenes of passerbys bursting into song and dance as the leads fall in love or swelling string sections as the lovers embrace. Rather director John Carney fashioned a stripped down more realistic musical where the songs emerge from the leads as they perform on street corners for friends and in recording studios. Carney informed the audience that the film was made in only seventeen days and for only 150000. The leads are professional musicians but have never acted before. No one will mistake this for a big budget feature but in the rawness of its presentation and performances the film gains extraordinary power.Carney's filmwhich he also wroteis a love story about waiting and deferring gratification. It's about the struggle of making ethical decisions when caught up in the fever of new love. Musicals are frequently larger than life odes to seizing the day and falling in rapturous love so much so that you can't help burst into song. Carney subverts our expectations of the musical and presents a film about quiet reserved loverstobe who struggle with the consequences of what a rapturous affair would mean to those they love.But don't think the movie is a bore. Rather it is a spellbinding and fantastic romantic film. Glen Hansard lead singer of The Frames stars alongside Czech singer and Dublin resident Marketa Irglova. Their musical performances are raw and powerful. Their harmonies are otherworldly and fantastic. The music is reminiscent of Damien Rice.

	onyx:emotionText "Once the Audience Award Winner at this year's Sundance Film Festival is a gem of a movie. I had the pleasure of seeing the film last night at the Tivoli Theater with the film's leads and director in attendance. Hoping for great word of mouth they are touring around the country with their film answering audience questions and performing songs from the film.Once is a musical but not as you might expect. There are no scenes of passerbys bursting into song and dance as the leads fall in love or swelling string sections as the lovers embrace. Rather director John Carney fashioned a stripped down more realistic musical where the songs emerge from the leads as they perform on street corners for friends and in recording studios. Carney informed the audience that the film was made in only seventeen days and for only 150000. The leads are professional musicians but have never acted before. No one will mistake this for a big budget feature but in the rawness of its presentation and performances the film gains extraordinary power.Carney's filmwhich he also wroteis a love story about waiting and deferring gratification. It's about the struggle of making ethical decisions when caught up in the fever of new love. Musicals are frequently larger than life odes to seizing the day and falling in rapturous love so much so that you can't help burst into song. Carney subverts our expectations of the musical and presents a film about quiet reserved loverstobe who struggle with the consequences of what a rapturous affair would mean to those they love.But don't think the movie is a bore. Rather it is a spellbinding and fantastic romantic film. Glen Hansard lead singer of The Frames stars alongside Czech singer and Dublin resident Marketa Irglova. Their musical performances are raw and powerful. Their harmonies are otherworldly and fantastic. The music is reminiscent of Damien Rice. Hearing them perform live after the film I realized how little the recordings we hear in the film have been altered. Fans of Rice and singersongwriter performers will enjoy this film.After the multiplexes have beaten you in to a pulp striving to entertain you this summer you would do well to seek out the quiet haunting Once. It sticks with you and has you humming on your way out of the lobby. It'll certainly make a bracing tonic to the suretobeoverstuffed Hairsprapy.";

It was the music in the trailer that captured my attention. Music is indeed a powerful thing. It was then that I told myself I had to see it. After seeing it it was everything I thought it would be and more. The story is simple and it's been told before but its execution is one that sets this movie apart from others. It's not a typical musical but more like a long music video. It's a story that illustrates a moment in time that we can easily relate to. This movie has moments of humor and it's songs are so telling. Hansard is charming and Irglova is candid. Both are very talented musicians turned actors.The story shows a different kind of love a friendship that provides confidence to steer the characters in the right direction for each of them which isn't always easy to do. The movie is sad funny real everything that life is and it gives you hope. It's about a moment that happens in life that may not come by again or may not last forever but it just might have the greatest impact on you. I know I'll be watching Once again.".

	schema:reviewBody "Once is about a young Irish busker with a torn guitar and a raft of achingly felt songs about a girlfriend he lost the year before. He works in Dublin at his dad's Hoover Repair Centre. One day as he's playing on the street a Czech woman who sells roses and cleans houses comes up and starts to talk to him. She's somewhat cool but she's also disarmingly honest. The dialogue seems understated offhand but the words seem to come from the heart. She plays the piano and later reveals she's written some songs herself and they get together to make music. Both are suffering from love affairs that went wrong. He longs for her but she keeps her distance. The simplicity of the acting makes the characters seem real like everything else in the movie. It doesn't try too hard. It trusts its material and it works.The recording session they wangle with a group of other buskers two guitarists and a youthful drummer is a metaphor for this whole film. These people know nothing about recording but they've got good material and the initially skeptical engineer winds up acknowledging that they've made a beautiful thing.Once's transitions are a little awkward sometimes and its images aren't fancy but the story moves you without having any sentimental payoffs. Kitchen sink filmmaking it works if you believe in what you're doing. And have something to work with. The core of Once is the music. It's what they have to work with. The studio recording session has the good feel of things coming together it's so strong and uncalculatedfeeling it makes the studio scene in Craig Brewer's Hustle and Flow look selfconscious. In Once the sound of the music speaks without special need for dialogue or closeups. The real love story of Once is the love of musicians playing together. Few movies perhaps have captured any better that warmth and pleasure of making music with others.People have said this is a musical. If so it redefines the musical as some American musicals have done recently especially Spring Awakening and Passing Strange. What makes the idea fly is that it's as if the young man and the young woman can't express what they feel for each other and the only way they can get their emotions across is to burst into song. But the songs are their songs not some composer's. It's all perfectly organic.Perfection it turns out doesn't have to be perfect.Starring Glen Hansard of The Frames and Marketa Irglova.".

At the end of the day we both really liked this movie not too sentimental and the music which is written and performed by the two main characters is excellent. It irks me to see other Irish people in here with such negative views it really seems like its something personal towards Glen Hansard. I don't know the guy whatsoever but this is about the film which is worth seeing.I'd seen Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova live in Christchurch cathedral in Dublin which in itself was pretty different. I'd only been inside the cathedral once before pretty much as a tourist. During the gig he gave a solo performance which stands out in my mind as the best I've ever seen just him and an acoustic guitar. I've seen A LOT of bands big and small so that is really saying something. If you get a chance go see them.".

	schema:reviewBody "My Synopsis A Guy with no name  Glen Hansard of the Irish band Frames is singing his heart out on the streets of Dublin for tip money. One day a Czech Girl with no name  Marketa Irglova stops to listen to the Guy play his music. She is very impressed by his songs and she asks if he wrote his own music. The Guy says that he writes and loves to play his own songs to himself even if the street crowd wants to hear other music. It is nice to earn tips but that is not what his music is all about. The Guy lives at home and helps his father repair vacuum cleaners but he has a dream of becoming a recording star. His girlfriend of many years has just left him and is now living in London. You can tell what this has done to his emotions because it is being reflected in his new songs. The Girl who happens to have a broken vacuum cleaner also has a musical background of playing the piano and writing songs. Their music brings them together and the Girl begins to help the Guy realize his dream. They begin to share their music and their feeling for each other. They put together a band with other street players and rent a recording studio for the weekend to record two demos. This could be the start of a new and wonderful life.My Comment The storyline is almost like a reality TV show. The people are not actors and they are naturally doing things in their lives that they just want to do. This is not your typical Hollywood movie as to the ending and especially the costs. The writerdirector John Carney made the film in 17 days for an unbelievable 130000. John Carney did not have the expensive steady cam cameras but he used hand held cameras with telephoto lens so he wouldn't have to get a permit to film in Dublin. You will notice the movement of the pictures and hopefully it will not give you motion sickness because it gives the film a raw feeling which in turn makes it feel real to the audience. Hansard and Irglova are charming together and very supportive of each other. All three people were at the screening that I attended and they had a QA session and sang 4 songs after the movie. The three have been friends for many years. That is why I said that the movie is like a reality TV show where friends got together to make music. Hearing them perform live after the movie I recognize that it was the same performance that I saw on the screen. Now as for the music personally I liked some of the songs but most of the music was not the type of music that I would listen to on the radio. Overall the film will give you a unique experience and realism that we normally don't get out of Hollywood. Fox Searchlight Run time 125 Rated R 710".

With what has to be the simplest story I've seen on screen in a long time it gets everything right. Once is a perfect little gem both concise and powerful in a small but infinitely memorable package. Literally a guy and a girl meet on a street corner in Dublin while he plays guitar for loose change. This chance encounter sets into motion a series of events that will bring kindred souls together with the strongest bond of love and friendship as they both try to reconcile with themselves and give their lost loves a second chance. You can't portray the unfathomable link love holds people together with better than this. These two are not lovers in the traditional sense but neither will ever be able to forget the friendship they forged and how they helped pull each other out of their respective emotional ruts. They are lovers of the mind and soul.I'll admit that I am a huge sucker for brilliant music in film. Whether it be a musical like Moulin Rouge! or a story that is enhanced by its soundtrack like The Royal Tenenbaums or a visually stunning piece set to a haunting score as in The Fountain I cannot get enough. The power that an assault on the eyes and ears simultaneously has can't be beat. This entire film is shot with handheld camera many times subversively for instance when our lead Guy and Girl go to a diner for lunch the camera stays outside looking in but you can tell the sound is coming from within by tape recorder as the background noise is very noticeable. The graininess and intimate quality shown by this style of filmmaking only makes you feel the realism that is pouring from each frame. These two actors are singers themselves and accomplished musicians. Glen Hansard and Markta Irglov are truly and utterly remarkable. Their interactions are never forced or fabricated this film feels like a behind the scenes documentary on the creation of an album.Once is definitely a musical above anything else. Half of this film takes place with songs either being sung in real time or being played over a montage sequence. Rather than use the words of the music to tell the story writerdirector John Carney uses them to setup the emotional core and existence for our two leads. The words they sing are meaningful to their characters and how they react after uttering the lyrics can be both joyous and heartbreaking. He must be credited with having the guts to stage many musical moments in single takes letting the performances and the music take over the scene. To go from the sheer happiness of laying down a track in the studio to the sorrowfilled moment of Irglov unable to finish singing the song she wrote for her old love back to the comradery of finishing their demo is a rollercoaster of emotions that sum up the whole film completely. There is not a misstep in sight. From the fateful meeting at our start to the bittersweet perfection that is the final scene you don't get many opportunities to see original work like this in cinema anymore.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let's say you're watching a movie and you are loving it and at the end you cheer and tell yourself that this was an awesome movie! and then you realize as the credits are rolling that the 2 main characters are just called guy and girltheir names are never mentioned the whole movie! That is the beauty of Once you are so drawn into the story and interplay between the guy and girl that you don't need names. Each character is defined by who they are to each other and those in their lives! Glen Hansard singer of the Frames does a great job of playing the heartbroken street buskervacuum repairman who pours his pain out in his music. The guy is so appealing and likable that even when he has a momentary lapse of reason and acts like an arsehole you forgive him because you know it is so out of character for him. Marketa Irglova plays the girl with a mix of winsome charm and worldly smarts that makes you like her from the instant that the guy and the viewers meet her. The girl is a czech concert pianist who is estranged from her husband and making a living in Dublin with the odd job here and there. She misses playing her piano but cannot afford to buy one for herself so she has to make do with playing occasionally in a club or in a music shop with a nice understanding manager. When they meet the guy is taking a break from his typical popular streetmusic set to perform his own music a song that is both smart and soulful but probably not popular enough to elicit any money. Their first conversation is funny and revealing and serves to set the tone for their future interactions. There is a chemistry between them but also a very sweet reluctance to go beyond the bounds of their relationship. Once is directed by John Carney also of Frames fame and shot by Tim Fleming and the film style is mainly pseudodocumentary with a lot of handheld shots and onstreet settings that take place in the midst of the real world. I do have to say that Dublin and the seaside look great and there are more than a few great landscapes that will take your breath away. There are no big stars and only a few actors who might be recognizable by eagleeyed IrishUK movie buffs. Once is ALL ABOUT THE MUSIC Glen and Marketa write their own songs and perform them in realistic settings with nobody just breaking out into song in the middle of a scene and without any cheesy dance scenes or spotlights. The soundtrack is catchy and soulful with some very heartfelt lyrics and easy to enjoy music. Once could almost be a documentary of how Glen and Marketa and Tim hit it big they are were? on tour in the US. John Carney does a masterful job of telling the story in a very appealing manner while avoiding a lot of the clichs that infest so many movies today. And yet there are many familiar scenes where you almost know what is going to happen but are still pleasantly surprised when it does. Especially touching for me was the scene where the guy plays his completed demo for his dad nervously awaiting a verdict great stuff! Once is the kind of movie that isn't widely publicized or splashed on the TV or radio at first but then there is such acclaim from those who have seen it that pretty soon everybody is jumping on the bandwagon. 2007 is so far are really good year for movies but I'd venture to day that Once is one of the best of the year. Once is worth see more than once. Tell your friends neighbors and acquaintances to go see Once they will thank you for the tip  and you will be able to go with them.".

	schema:reviewBody "What bitter sweetness this film stirs within the deepest bowels of any viewer! And how startling it is that such a small miniscule piece of work that stirs such emotions that big bloated epics many times fail to stir? Production value is low but the almost documentarystyle filmmaking only adds to the realism. The movie was shot mostly on video and with many extended uncut long takes quite unlike the complex operatic setups we've seen in the films of Martin Scorsese and more recently in Alfonso Cuaron's Children of Men but rather simple static shots simple depicting our two characters interacting. Most of the film is just that  the two characters interacting  but such incredible depth of emotion derives from these interactions that it is truly inspirational. The filmmakers' and actors' capturing of total and utter realism is so convincing that the film might as well be a documentary feature about two music lovers following them from their chance encounter and throughout the course of a whirlwind impulsive week of musicmaking. But what's truly remarkable is the emotional rainbow this documentation provides.The key word in this film is simplicity. The plot is as simple as it gets  a chance meeting and a week of music making. Production value is almost nonexistent and the cinematography is obviously simplistic and minimalist  except for one setup involving a crane which seemed a little out of place for my taste. The acting is extremely minimalist and realistic we sort of get the feeling that our two stars are very much like the characters they play in real life much like the same feelings evoked from Richard Linklater's Before SunriseBefore Sunset in which we know Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy donate so much of themselves into their characters.Many people have labeled this film as a modernday musical. Well at first I resented this statement as all of the music in the movie is performed onscreen within the context of the film. We don't see any breaking out into songanddance in this film it is all the real actual music these two people are making onscreen and in real time. But later on I thought about it a bit and eventually reached a conclusion that may explain why people describe the movie so. In the classic movie musicals the songs all deal with advancing and portraying the plot. In Once though there is a twist Since there isn't actually much of a plot to talk about although the characters DO have a wellrounded arc the songs all deal with advancing and portraying the characters' emotional states. Listen to the brokenness of Hansard's earlier songs written about his girlfriend in London. Or to the sad longing of the lyrics Irglov writes to Hansard's asyetunwritten melody that he leaves her on a CD player.If the songs pack a big emotional punch the rest of the movie packs a much more subtle emotional resonance. I think this may just be one of the saddest truest and most beautiful cinematic depictions of platonic and entirely unrequited love. Many people have said that they left this film with feelings of elation and levity. I myself found the ending extremely melancholy. It's great that both of our characters at least try to get back together with there long lost loves but it is sad that they don't get to see eachother for one last time. It is sad to think that even if the Guy goes back to London he may not be able to mend the wounds with his girlfriend. It is sad to think that if the Girl couldn't get along with her husband the first time chances are that the same troubles will arise the second time around. It is sad to think that if Hansard isn't himself a stadiumfilling musician in real life his character in the movie probably also won't be one. And it is great of course that the film ends where it does in their parting and doesn't linger on what happens after the Guy arrives in London and submits his demo tape for example. The film begins and ends in the relationship between the two people and leaves it at that. But how sad it is that when the Guy asks the girl if she loves her husband she replies in Czech so that he won't understand no I love you. And it is saddest to think that all the beautiful happy and good things that happen in the film can happen only once in a lifetime. As the film's tagline says How often do you find the right person? The answer lies in the film's title Once. Many other questions can be asked How often do you get a chance to go from being a Dublin busker to recording a professional demo tape? How often do you get a loan from a bank teller that just happens to have a passion for what you're trying to get a loan for? How often do you get to secretly rip off your father's beloved motorcycle for the day? The answer to all the questions Once.Shot on a shoestring budget it's films like these that promise a very promising future indeed for independent foreign film. Devoid of the weights carried by Hollywood productions and the need to contradict those weights fulfilled by American independent film the independent cinema of the world is free to draw inspiration from whatever source it requires be it the human psyche random surrealism or Irish folk music. Once in particular succeeds so admirably in all its fields not only because of the stunningly beautiful music it features but also because of the simplicity and the anonymity of its characters and events. Can this happen to anyone? Yes. How many times can it happen? Once.".

	schema:reviewBody "OnceA movie that really is hard to put into words but demonstrates that you don't need a multi million dollar budget Alist Hollywood actorsdirectors and special effects to make an incredible film. It does what any good movie should do tells a story honestly and drops the viewer right into the action so as to feel you're there and care about what's happening.In this case it's the story of a young man and woman who wound't otherwise have anything in common other than she has a busted vacuum and he works at a vacuum repair shop or so it seems until you discover that these two ordinary poor people actually have the same passion for writing and playing music neither having the capacity to do so in the way they would like. For him it's playing songs in streets and his tiny apartment for anyone who'll listen but no one who can understand. Enter a woman who hasn't been able to outlet her own musical creativity due to a young child and failing marriage and you get an explosion of musical and romantic creativity.John Carney's film is really an album on screen and I have to mention that it is the music that drives the picture but it's not a musical in the vain of people randomly breaking into song that drives normal people crazy because no one ever does that in REAL LIFE but he shows you where GREAT music really comes from and how it's created. Never once are you thinking 'Oh great there breaking into song again' because not only is the music incredible mostly written by Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova but it's given real time and they don't cut songs short but let you listen as if you were there in the store studio apartment bus or wherever. The movie just has so many perfect little scenes and touches like the banker who wants to play them a song of his own when they ask for a loan or the scene when they finally get to record and it's abundantly clear that no one knows what they're doing. Lastly I have to mention that it is the treatment of their interestrelationship that is the best part of the film. It's refreshing to see romance done right without sex or over the top cheesy melodramatic dialog the type of crap that only happens 'in the movies' here it doesn't need to be said because like true romance it's not spoken it's felt. Carney avoids the horribly overwrought sexploitation of malefemale relationships in modern film and actually respects these two characters enough to end the movie right with the viewer walking away just like the two smitten musicians...wanting more of their music and of each other.".

	schema:headline " Excellent look at the seething underbelly of New York City.";
	schema:reviewBody "It is hard to understand why this film couldn't command better distribution than it did.  It has a bankable cast a strong story and a realistic presentation.  It is a raw and dark story about corruption by contractors supplying the transit system in New York City.  Parts of the story are all too familiar and the entire film is very Godfatheresque.  However while The Godfather' glorified organized crime this film gives a much grittier view of the dirty deals and conniving stripped of the Hollywood veneer. That is precisely what I liked about it and in all likelihood it is the reason that it foundered on the market.Leo Handler Mark Wahlberg is just returning home from prison on a car theft conviction when the movie opens.  He is repentant and sincerely wants to go straight.  The deck is stacked against him though because everyone he knows other than his mother Ellen Burstyn aunt Faye Dunaway and cousin Charlize Theron is corrupt.  Leo applies for a job with his uncle Frank James Caan who is a contractor supplying parts to the New York subway system.  He is reunited with an old friend Willie Gutierrez Joaquin Phoenix who is currently working for Frank.  Willie is eyeball deep in shady deals including the sabotage of other suppliers.  One night a sabotage mission goes wrong and Leo assaults a policeman while trying to escape the scene.  A manhunt ensues and both the cops and Leo's uncle are trying to hunt him down.  With sinister intent Uncle Frank wants to find him first so he won't blow the lid on the crooked dealings.The story written and directed by James Gray delves into various character studies that bog down at times.  However speaking as a person who once lived there it is an excellent rendering of New York attitudes and mannerisms and includes plenty of notsoglamorous shots of New York's seething underbelly.  This is a New Yorker's eye view of the city far from the glitz of Broadway Wall Street and the art galleries.  It shows the competitiveness and machismo of a segment of society known only to the locals.The acting by the ensemble cast is outstanding.  All the players capture the essence of the New York middle class gestalt beautifully.  Mark Wahlberg delivers a somber but resolute character trapped in a vortex of graft and corruption.  His performance is understated yet powerful.  James Caan is one of the best at playing the smalltime racketeer and he nails it again with his portrayal of the dirty dealing supplier.  Joaquin Phoenix also shines as Willie giving him a macho personality and the ability to rationalize any act according to his own code of morality.  The cast includes Faye Dunaway Ellen Burstyn and Charlize Theron in strong supporting roles.  Steve Allen makes an extended cameo as the tainted commissioner.This film is excellent and has been sadly overlooked by the distributors and the public.  I rated it a 910 despite a somewhat familiar storyline because the presentation is so precise and the style so unsanitized.  The film has a real New York feeling to it especially recognizable to anyone who has lived there.  It has my vote for the sleeper of 2000.".

The deck is stacked against him though because everyone he knows other than his mother Ellen Burstyn aunt Faye Dunaway and cousin Charlize Theron is corrupt.  Leo applies for a job with his uncle Frank James Caan who is a contractor supplying parts to the New York subway system.  He is reunited with an old friend Willie Gutierrez Joaquin Phoenix who is currently working for Frank.  Willie is eyeball deep in shady deals including the sabotage of other suppliers.  One night a sabotage mission goes wrong and Leo assaults a policeman while trying to escape the scene.  A manhunt ensues and both the cops and Leo's uncle are trying to hunt him down.  With sinister intent Uncle Frank wants to find him first so he won't blow the lid on the crooked dealings.The story written and directed by James Gray delves into various character studies that bog down at times.  However speaking as a person who once lived there it is an excellent rendering of New York attitudes and mannerisms and includes plenty of notsoglamorous shots of New York's seething underbelly.  This is a New Yorker's eye view of the city far from the glitz of Broadway Wall Street and the art galleries.  It shows the competitiveness and machismo of a segment of society known only to the locals.The acting by the ensemble cast is outstanding.  All the players capture the essence of the New York middle class gestalt beautifully.  Mark Wahlberg delivers a somber but resolute character trapped in a vortex of graft and corruption.  His performance is understated yet powerful.  James Caan is one of the best at playing the smalltime racketeer and he nails it again with his portrayal of the dirty dealing supplier.  Joaquin Phoenix also shines as Willie giving him a macho personality and the ability to rationalize any act according to his own code of morality.  The cast includes Faye Dunaway Ellen Burstyn and Charlize Theron in strong supporting roles.  Steve Allen makes an extended cameo as the tainted commissioner.This film is excellent and has been sadly overlooked by the distributors and the public.  I rated it a 910 despite a somewhat familiar storyline because the presentation is so precise and the style so unsanitized.  The film has a real New York feeling to it especially recognizable to anyone who has lived there.  It has my vote for the sleeper of 2000.";

The Yards stands on its own and even though it is no masterpiece it is a very interesting and tense drama with a great cast. Mark Wahlberg does a good job but Joaquin Phoenix is certainly the standout. Also his complex character is by far more interesting than Wahlberg's stereotype.

	schema:reviewBody ". . . you know you've got a movie that tried something different. Not NEW necessarily as The Yards is paced structured and shot like it was made before 1976.  But you don't see that often these days. The Yards is an entertaining and noble attempt at a tribute to crime films of that era. I have friends who don't have the attention span to sit through The Godfatheron some days neither do I  I wouldn't recommend this film to them. Reared as our younger generation was on Spielbergian and MTVcut films the pacing of both that film and The Yards are slow and deliberate  sometimes hard to take.  The Yards could have used a bit of tightening up in editing just seconds off of a scene here a scene there to move things along but still it's a strong film. The first thing that caught my eye was the sparse dialogue.  There's a lot of acting going on here and not of the scenerychewing variety recent Pacino.  The actors are given a lot of room to act with their eyes and bodies.  You're not hit over the head with 2D stock characters although it may appear so at first.  The story is genre  excon returning to his New York borough neighborhood falls right into the same circles that got him in trouble in the first place.  What follows is a story of corruption redemption and family structured almost as a Greek Tragedy.  But quietly. There are no good guys or bad guys as almost everyone is on the make. The overall impression projected is that everyone is protecting their own and trying to succeed in a system that they live in  not one they created or control.Mark Wahlberg isn't a great actor but he delivers what the character requires.  Charlize Theron isn't in her element playing a Queenschick but aside from a faltering accent she does pretty well. Excellent acting is delivered by Joachin Phoenix as well as veterans Caan Dunaway and Ellen Burstyn. The Yards is a good movie although admittedly not for the average moviegoing audience.  It likely won't meet their expectations of what a good movie is.".

It is a wellacted morality tale written and directed by James Gray that is as topical now as when the first bureaucrat accepted graft.  Mark Wahlberg's Leo Handler character is a loser who seeks to redeem himself from the neglect of his sick mother and the evil he has done to others.  If only his friends and relatives had similarly good intentions.  The world he inhabits is a society with the unwritten code of conduct to never snitch or else pay the consequences.  The best scene involves Leo as he nervously proceeds with his orders to kill the policeman who can finger him in the rail yard assault.  Can he justify yet one more crime in order to maintain the good graces of his benefactors?  Joaquin Phoenix's character Willie is perhaps the most tormented figure having to choose between his highminded intentions and his immoral survival instincts. He becomes less the controller and more the henchman of what others tell him to do.  The excellent cast gives The Yard a true flavor of the perverse nature of favoritism from Faye Dunaway and James Caan to Ellen Burstyn and Charlize Theron in a surprisingly youthful dark mascara look.  However Joan Allen would have added a harsher more pessimistic visage to the sometimes inappropriately bubbly Burstyn.  This film displays well how corruption commands people's lives and how hard it is to break out of that code of conduct.".

	schema:headline " A much more complex and interesting film noir than it seems.";
	schema:reviewBody "What is interesting about Grey's picture is the use of understatement to emphasize the complexity of negotiated relationships in the New York world where mob business and city administration intersect. Wahlberg's comparative lack of expressiveness suits his role as a minor crook out of jail and wanting to go straight it's echoed in his mother's passivity and her statement that the two of them have this in common. He's not stupid but he's tentative as he emerges from jail back into the world his uncle is willing to help but has complex and risky operations that make him cautious. In any event Wahlberg's tentativeness leads him instead to his old and apparently warm friend who's grown into slack opportunism as his uncle clearly knows and would like to keep his nephew away from. When the friend stupidly kills the yard manager he tries to spare his pal but finally lets the latter take the rap and run off in violation of his parole. The film gets interesting at this point one expects Wahlberg to be the victim but he has figured out that he's been set up that even his uncle is willing to have him killed to cover up the crime and that he's got to drop his earlier loyalties and figure out a way to clear and protect himself at the same time. The solution is a real New York compromise between truth and justice the identifying cop is paid off the real crook kills his true love inadvertently and crushed with anguish is taken. Wahlberg has set himself right with the law probably will be used by one side or the other of the warring tracks manufacturing moguls crime and bribery continue as always in the Big Apple. What's refreshing about the picture is its calmness of tone  the violence is justified but not overdone the acting has the assurance of real people doing what they must. Poor photography at times  confusing shots which add to the difficulty of following a complex plot. But it's a better picture than comments suggest.".

	schema:reviewBody "Imagine a painting hanging in a museum.  It's a masterfully rendered portrait of a family a house in the background.  Maybe a lake off to one side. The picture is absolutely flawless and if you merely glance at it or even give it the onceover you can recognize it as a picture of a house and a family and move on.But if you stop to look at it it's not quite perfect.  The color of a scarf clashes with the rest of mom's outfit.  That squirrel in the tree only has three legs.  Little things to let you know that the artist while talented still hasn't perfected his craft.  Or more likely if the painting weren't so excellently rendered you wouldn't be able to point out the scarf or the squirrel or any of the finer details.Like this painting we have The Yards a story centering on Leo Handler Wahlberg freshly released from prison and trying to look after himself and his mother.  The story is welltold the characters with the exception of Dunaway are carefully acted and this characterdriven drama is fascinating to watch.But taken as a whole parts of the film were just overlooked.  Wahlberg acts with a blank stare his character just as dumb as his character in Boogie Nights.  None of the female characters exist for any reason except for the audience to feel pity for them.  Every death is predictable minutes before it happens.  And the entire story spirals into such a depressing destination I can't at all think of who I could recommend this film to.  It was wellmade but James Gray would do better as a playwright with material like this.An exquisitely wellmade beautifully directed film.  The pictures are wonderful and the performances are excellent but be warned that this film is a serious serious downer.  May the director find lighter material soon.".

	schema:reviewBody "'The Yards' is a sombre tale of corrupt city bureaucrats semigangsterish businessmen and the smalltime crooks who do their dirty work as they tussle over maintenance contracts on the New York subway system. This is a world of mundane corruption and criminality whose inhabitants live several rungs down the ladder from the kind of mafia dynasties depicted in 'The Godfather'. Although the cinematography certainly nods towards Coppolla's epic particularly the dark brooding interiors this is a less selfconsciously grandiose drama more an intimate study in betrayal.The chief protagonist is Leo Handler Mark Wahlberg a young man returning home after a spell in prison. As is obligatory in such tales he is intent on going straight but finds himself lured by his smoothoperating buddy Willie Gutierrez Joaquin Phoenix into the semilegitimate business operations of his stepuncle Frank Olchin James Caan.Frank is finding it increasingly tough to win subway contracts due to competition from rival Hispanic firms who are being aided by preferential treatment policies for minorities. This has led him to task Willie with sabotaging the operations of his competitors so they fail to meet municipal work standards. When one of these sabotage missions goes violently wrong Leo finds out just how fragile loyalties can be. Nepotism and friendship soon evaporate when their is a murder to be explained and Leo must fend for himself if he is not to take the fall.The film provides an intriguing look into a sordid and incestuous community in which family and business interests intertwine with connections favours and dirty tricks being the accepted way of getting things done. The protagonists are not simply bad people but are proper characters compromised as much by the environment they operate in as by lax personal morality. In the aftermath of the murder their betrayals are not mere coldblooded expedients but anguished decisions driven by instinctive selfpreservation.Overall this is a subtly observed drama skillfully acted particularly by Joaquin Phoenix and handsomely shot. The final climax may be just a tad overwrought but personally it could not spoil an otherwise admirable film.".

I have never seen him give a bad performance and I've seen most of his work.

Joaquin added that touch of class which brought out better performances from the other actors.  I will watch it again and again that's for sure just to see the master Joaquin at work.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a review of Little Odessa The Yards and We Own the Night three crime dramas by director James Gray.Released in 1994 Little Odessa stars Tim Roth as Joshua Shapira a volatile criminal who has been exiled by his family. A prodigal son returns narrative the film watches as Roth returns to his family home. Though his relatives still distrust him Joshua is idolised by his younger brother little Reuben Shapira Edward Furlong. The film ends as most prodigal son tales do with Reuben dying paying for his brother's sins.Little Odessa was Gray's debut. It's a very good drama well acted by the always electric Tim Roth but the film's ethnic details are unconvincing and Gray falters in his final act with an obvious overblown sequence in which little Reuben is accidentally gunned down.Gray followed Odessa up with The Yards 2000 a crime drama set in the commuter rail yards of New York City. The film's structure is similar to Odessa and sees Mark Wahlberg playing an exconvict who returns home after a short stint in prison. Wahlberg attempts to stay clean to keep his nose out of crime but is drawn back into the criminal underworld by a friend played by Joaquin Phoenix. The film retains the brotherhood dynamics of Odessa Wahlberg playing the good son who eventually turns on his suffocating sibling. Once again the film ends with a ridiculously overthetop death sequence.While The Yards has a certain smothering pretentiousness about it convinced about its own importance it's lit like Rembrandt street fights are filmed like Visconti's Rocco and His Brothers and it's reaching for the tone of Coppola's The Godfather Gray nevertheless cooks up some wonderful strokes like a beautifully sensitive welcomehome party a wordless assassination attempt and a fine aching performance by Wahlberg. It's a great mixed bag.Gray then directed We Own The Night arguably his best crime flick. The good brotherbad brother motif returns this time with Mark Wahlberg and Joaquin Phoenix playing a pair of brothers on either side of the law. Phoenix's a perpetually high playboy who owns a nightclub frequented by drugrunners and mafia types and Wahlberg's a straightarrow cop trying to keep the streets clean. When the mafia unleashes an assassination campaign on local cops Phoenix switches allegiances goes undercover and attempts to take down the mob. There are touches of Donnie Brasco Rush Point Break Serpico State of Grace Infernal Affairs and every other undercover cop movie you can think of but the film is beautifully lit is atypically straightfaced and features a superb rainsoaked car chase.Some have suggested that Gray's trilogy should be celebrated for working in a classical almost conventionally Greek mould. That his conventionality suggests that all his characters are at the mercy of already in place contours their fates forgone. Mostly though Gray's trilogy highlights the ways in which contemporary artists have struggled to conceive of a response to postmodernism. The crime movies of say Tarantino and Scorsese are unashamedly postmodern toying with and regurgitating clichs from 1930s Warner machine gun operas and MGM crime flicks. They aren't about crime so much as they're pastiche jobs jazzed up films about crime films. As a response to this aesthetic artists who deem themselves serious who rightfully ask what exactly comes next? tend to look backwards at what came before as though postwar modernism by virtue of being modernism is intrinsically the solution. This leads to classically shot and written but wholly regressive fare like Gray's trilogy which essentially unscrambles the world's Scorseses and Tarantinos and puts you right back in the 1940s minus the irony and flippancy.But you can't go backwards in this way your audience will always be ten steps ahead and there will always be a huge chasm between your solemnity and the tired insights your film delivers. This is why true progressive works in the genre for example fare like The Wire which actively attempts a cognitive mapping of both global capitalism and crime are neither modernist or postmodern whilst possessing the vital traits of both. Philosophers have alternatively coined this new movement neoprimitivism pseudomodernism participatism postpost modernism but the one that seems to be sticking is new modernism.Whatever you call it this hypothetical movement rejects postmodern nihilism nothing matters there is no truth it's just a film actively tries to convey the complexities of our world and covertly believes that it is possible and necessary for individuals to make value judgements take stands approach objectivity and back facts up. It is modernist in its desires to understand teach decipher and make better the world and in its emphasis on culture society technology and politics. The movement doesn't reject postmodernism but coopts its tropes and bends them to suit its aim questioning agency subjectivity and attempting to piece together the fragments and multiple perspectives that typify complex systems. In short truly relevant crime films simultaneously simulate our contemporary environment of junk noise commerce and static before proceeding to decode organise and target roots. As William Gibson said way back in the 1980s future great artist will function like search engines mapping and making sense of the detritus. Gray goes backwards to when there was less noise.7.910  Worth one viewing.".

The crime movies of say Tarantino and Scorsese are unashamedly postmodern toying with and regurgitating clichs from 1930s Warner machine gun operas and MGM crime flicks. They aren't about crime so much as they're pastiche jobs jazzed up films about crime films. As a response to this aesthetic artists who deem themselves serious who rightfully ask what exactly comes next? tend to look backwards at what came before as though postwar modernism by virtue of being modernism is intrinsically the solution. This leads to classically shot and written but wholly regressive fare like Gray's trilogy which essentially unscrambles the world's Scorseses and Tarantinos and puts you right back in the 1940s minus the irony and flippancy.But you can't go backwards in this way your audience will always be ten steps ahead and there will always be a huge chasm between your solemnity and the tired insights your film delivers. This is why true progressive works in the genre for example fare like The Wire which actively attempts a cognitive mapping of both global capitalism and crime are neither modernist or postmodern whilst possessing the vital traits of both. Philosophers have alternatively coined this new movement neoprimitivism pseudomodernism participatism postpost modernism but the one that seems to be sticking is new modernism.Whatever you call it this hypothetical movement rejects postmodern nihilism nothing matters there is no truth it's just a film actively tries to convey the complexities of our world and covertly believes that it is possible and necessary for individuals to make value judgements take stands approach objectivity and back facts up. It is modernist in its desires to understand teach decipher and make better the world and in its emphasis on culture society technology and politics. The movement doesn't reject postmodernism but coopts its tropes and bends them to suit its aim questioning agency subjectivity and attempting to piece together the fragments and multiple perspectives that typify complex systems. In short truly relevant crime films simultaneously simulate our contemporary environment of junk noise commerce and static before proceeding to decode organise and target roots. As William Gibson said way back in the 1980s future great artist will function like search engines mapping and making sense of the detritus. Gray goes backwards to when there was less noise.7.910  Worth one viewing.";

	schema:reviewBody "One man's decision to turn around his life in a rush and another's rush to avoid having his life turnedaround set the stage for this noir tragedy. We've seen these folks before in other movies but we're still moved because we might have made worse choices still in their shoes.Leo Wahlberg's character returns from prison to a great welcome home. He just wants to become a productive citizen again. His cousin's Erika Theron is dating his best friend Willie Phoenix who's working for her stepdad Frank Caan. Frank wants Leo to take the high road towards a new life but Willie's encouraging the low...and what young man can resist such temptation?Although Leo his Mom Burstyn and aunt Dunaway all want him to go straight Leo can't see that Willie's way is more than a shade crooked. Before Leo gets a chance to really choose Willie makes a choice that sends the families the yards and borough politics on a collision course. Each step along the way folks make their prisoner's dilemma choices with disastrous results for all.The film is shot dark evoking the barely colorized films of the 50s and 60s but clearly takes place within the last decade. The noir mood is held by the high quality of the acting I don't usually like Wahlberg but for once he doesn't get in the way of his natural charm. WriterDirector James Gray keeps us in the mood spending just enough time letting us glimpse the hard choices that everyone makes...and to see why they choose poorly over and over again.We want Leo to choose the clean life but we can see why he doesn't and why we might not in his shoes. We want Willie to walk away rather than act rashly but we can see why he can't. We want Uncle Frank to do the right thing but it's clear why he won't.It's too bad that Gray had to ruin the ending with a beentheredonethat Hollywood ending. Mind you he's done a better job than other corruptionandpolitics movies but it still feels a bit like a copout you should pardon the expression.Despite the ending it's a great film. And you'll find yourself still thinking about Leo and company's choices for days afterward.I rated this 810.If you don't like slow moody noirs give this a pass.".

Nepotism is the ultimate explanation. More the screenplay is cinematically presented  the points are made visually and through body language and situation not banged over our heads with explication. In my past I worked both for the Queens Borough President the one whose name is actually mentioned in the movie and no one west of the Hudson let alone younger will have the slightest idea what the reference means and for the MTA where we were constantly stunned by what went on in the bowels of the Transit Authority while my husband has supervised City contractors for ethics violations so I was amazed how mostly accurate the movie wasincluding a cameo by Councilman Peter Vallone as a councilman. Just a small quibble that this movie would have been more accurate if it had been set in a time period before the Board of Estimate was declared unconstitutional and contracting procedures were changed.While Cherlize Theron is somewhat miscast and misdressed Joaquin Phoenix blows the screen away. He steals every scene from Mark Wahlberg who is supposed to be the moral center of the movie and his last scenes alone are explosive. The older male actors are as impeccably cast as The Sopranos though the ethnicity of the characters vs. the actors is a bit confusing. James Caan is more comfortable in this patriarchal role than he was in The Way of the Gun he clearly felt at home in Astoria. Steve Lawrence yeah THAT Steve Lawrence doesn't have Donald Manes's charisma as Borough President though he actually does look a bit like him. Faye Dunaway is surprisingly spoton I've been to many of those Queens political dinners and saw wives dressed and acting like her. Ellen Burstyn in the third bridgeandtunnelmom role I've seen her in this month got to have her hair combed this time.There is a surprising lack of pop songs on the soundtrack as so many would have been appropriate instead it's mostly Howard Shore's score. I kept thinking of Bruce Springsteen singing Nothing feels better than blood on blood. . . There's wonderful views and uses of the Queens landscape throughout this movie. This fully realizes an outer borough. If Gray is on his way to do a pentateuch on crime in NYC I'll go to the ones on each borough.
