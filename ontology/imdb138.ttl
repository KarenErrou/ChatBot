	schema:headline " Hilarious send up of epic proportions!";
	schema:reviewBody "Personal Services is an exceptional film that has been underrated ignored and obscured by the avalanche of goon comedies which crowd the late 80's and 90's.  Its portrait of a kindly brothel keeper dogooder which might be described as the kinky middle aged sm version of Austen's Emma is so packed with outrageous imagery one could forget to admire its level headed attitude toward sex. The glee it takes at exposing the absolute silliness of adults on the subject as well as its constant stabs at the hypocrisy of the British middle class makes it stand out.  Neither of those subjects are particularly unknown to British comedy of course but Personal Services never lets up and skewers so many shoddy English values at the rate of swatting flies.The film is a strong departure of style for Terry Jones its director whose former The Meaning of Life would lead us to imagine another style altogether.  Certainly he is drawn to the material for its surrealistic and madcap flavor but he surprisingly brings qualities of realism detail and nittygrit to the episodes that help keep the film grounded in a believable social milieu.The script by David Leland Mona Lisa is a fictional account that follows the rise of Cynthia Payne the English madame who became the darling of the English press after several arrests in the middle 80's.  Leland also wrote and directed a film released the same year Wish You Were Here which captures Payne in her teenage years but Personal Services is much tighter rapidfire and more ambitious.The film veers between outrageous comic episodes and very real emotional moments that reflect the social realist scenes of earlier English films like A Taste of Honey and Room at the Top.  The  struggle of a woman deciding whether to take the plunge and become a prostitute the scene where the heroine confronts her distant dad at her sister's wedding the scenes that reflect the loneliness and isolation the heroine feels may not seem appropriate in a pulloutallthestops laugh fest but they help to deepen the themes of the film and give it both depth and breath. One of the more melancholy themes that stays dominant in the film is the deep emotional price one must pay for being a nonconformist.The vivid imagery Jones brought to the Monty Python films serves an equally symbolic purpose here.  The image of a prostitute with angel's wings flapping pitifully about a moonlit garden as she tries to escape the policeman who tackles her is an image which welds perfectly the film's sacred and profane themes and is unforgettable.  And there are so many daring in your face scenes the discipline scenes in the brothel the exposure of Dotty in the john the marvelous gift the madame gives both her father and son and they keep the film more surprising and fresh than most sex comedies of the 90's.Julie Waters gives one of her wittiest shaded and full performances but she is only one the many character actors in the film are perfect in tone and work together in extraordinary ways.  The film serves as a reality check about one's own uptight attitudes about sex. Your own squirming should be a revelation!    American viewers need to be very much on their toes however because some of the funniest dialogue is rapid with authentic accents and often thrown away.  Also helpful is to realize the slang expression willie' does NOT refer to a dolphin but to a guy's you know what.I am always running into people who discovered this film on their own and hold it high on their list of the greatest comedies.  I urge you to discover it for yourself!".

	schema:headline " Julie Walters not playing Cynthia Payne";
	schema:reviewBody "This film has a preface that it is fiction and though the writer David Leland was inspired by a book by Cynthia Payne  the infamous British Madam  this is not the story of Cynthia Payne. The disclaimer is repeated at the end and then we see that the production consultant was Cynthia Payne. Perhaps there was a legal necessity for Madam Payne and the filmmakers to provide this escape clause since the film's madam named Christine Painter was charged with possessing obscene material for gain and running a brothel.What makes this madam's brothel different is that Christine's clientele is gentlemen over 40 with a taste for kink though the bondage and discipline we see is very mild. You would have to be extremely prudish to be offended by such behaviour. What makes these scenes so funny is how ordinary the customers are which only reinforces the hypocrisy of the laws that consider prostitution a crime and the insight the tarts have into men's sexuality. I loved the line When the balls are full the brain is empty and the madam's argument that wives would never be wanting for anything as long as they kept their men despunked. As Christine Julie Walters delivers a brilliant comic performance. She is a nononsense uppity woman constantly in motion who has never cared for sex but enters into the business for economic reasons. The ads posted in a shop window are deliberately double entendred eg large chest for sale french polishing available. Walters looks surprising voluptuous here though as she becomes more successful she starts to resemble a drag queen. When she attends her sister's wedding there is a confrontation scene with her father and we see what a fool he is for not appreciating her.Director Terry Jones came from the Monty Python group but it is to his credit that the humor is not juvenile or in poor taste. Walters does have an odd scene where she is suddenly in an exotic location and spying on a couple having sex another where a revolving camera glorifies her romantic fantasies and the circumstances of a missed normal date hint at that old chestnut that whores are doomed to die lonely. But overall the tone is light and positive. Special mention is made of Shirley Stelfox as the stern Nanny and Danny Schiller as the maid with an undetermined sex.".

I suppose this is an attempt to be farcical and inspires the many comments about what a hilarious laugh riot it is. I want to sympathise with Christine Dolly and the other woman played excellently by Shirley Stelfox but I keep being distracted by their method acting  particularly from Julie Walters who employs her usual tricks and giggles and shouts when she can't think of anything else to do and when there's nothing to laugh at  but maybe that's the point. Her naivety is a running gag I thought he was making us a cupboard for us to hang our coats in! but one that wears thin. The Carry On films at their best were full of English wit  this has none. Though I liked this exchange Mr Papazoglou in seethrough negligee I love my wife! Christine That's nice. An opportunity missed.".

Director Terry Jones and screenwriter David Leland concoct a bawdy farce which manages to be quite funny and always engrossing without ever getting too vulgar or sleazy. Instead they treat the sordid subject matter with admirable wit taste and sensitivity. For example the clients just want to be accepted and tolerated as the blithely dirty old men that they are. Moreover there's a surprising and even touching sense of compassion and humanity for the seedy main characters and their seamy profession. In fact the topic of sexual deviance in its many permutations is handled in a commendably matter of fact way. Walters simply shines in her role she receives firstrate support from Shirley Stelfox as brash tart Shirley Danny Schiller as wise old transvestite pal Dotty Alec McCowen as jolly regular Wing Commander Morten Tim Woodward as jerky vice cop Timms and Ewan Hooper as her disapproving father Edward.

	schema:reviewBody "As a fan of Monty Python I've watched every movie directed by either Gilliam or Jones and one day I will manage to watch every single movie featuring them John Cleese Eric Idle and the other guys. Personal Services was a bit hard to find and although I've ranked it slightly below average the experience of watching it was actually quite a pleasant one.Since it's based on a real story I won't waste any time mentioning the plot in my review. The storyline is indeed engaging and as for the dialog I believe a decent effort was made by both the writers and the cast. Altogether Jones' comedic genius is visible and works in many scenes throughout the movie.However this was one of the first  if not the first  directing enterprise for Jones after his work with Monty Python during which he shared directing duties with Gilliam. It's interesting to notice how the director attempts to forge his own style specially in this case where he was a part of a big ensemble of extremely funny people.Jones managed to mature his style over his next films to the point I'd say his last one Absolutely Anything is perfect almost in every way. This movie is the beginning of that and although it's not brilliant it's entertaining and worth your time. In some instances it almost looks experimental like something out of film school. But even when it looks like that it still feels better than many movies with terrible plots or solid directing. Sometimes a funny person doing a sloppy job directing a good story is enough to make a movie watchable. At least I think it beats renowned directors showing off their Cinema credentials with an uninteresting plot.If not anything else this movie helped me solidify this notion there is probably nothing more important in Cinema than a good storyline.".

Who could have known that 25 years later Terry Jones the director would himself become a dirty old man but a much more wicked dirty old man than the rather harmless perverts featured here. Here's a man who left his wife of 40 years to run off with some cheap 20something golddigging tart old enough to be his granddaughter. Now Grandpa Jones and his Swedish sexkittenfantasygranddaughter are pushing their littler toddler through the streets of London. Google it and cringe. Aging gracefully or at least with a smidgen of dignity evidently wasn't in the stars for the only Welsh Python. Then again he always was a filthy old Marxist not giving a toss about the family unit  and that includes his own. PS celebrates not so much sexual freedom as it romanticizescelebrates perversion and we know that leftwingers will always celebrate it until they're blue in the face under the guise of diversity their favourite word these days. His wife should have taken this movie seriously as a sign of her husband's questionable sense of morality.PS isn't a laughoutloud comedy. In fact it isn't even a laughoutalittle comedy. It is chuckleworthy in several places but that's about it. What it is though is fairly interesting. Hardly attentiongrabbing mind you perhaps due to the subject matter which makes this movie quite outdated the forced tackiness may have shocked some people back in 1987 but it's peanuts now. Jones could not have predicted how decadent the world would become just decades after this movie was made which must please his cold Marxist heart or else he would have either made this movie more extreme or binned the project entirely. After all posterity is what he was after not just the quick buck how could anyone possibly think that a Marxist could care about financial again? I think they share everything with everyone anyway  much the way Jones will share his estate with his new Nordic sextoy. She provides the personal services he provides the cash and jetset lifestyle.Filming a comedy about prostitutes is certainly neither a difficult nor a commercially risky road to travel. The gags write themselves what's there NOT to laugh about? And yet this sleazy comedy fails just in that in spite of the obvious talents and charisma of Julie Walters. They couldn't have picked a better actress for the part the problem being that she plays it too broadly no doubt pushed to this kind of performance by Jones. Unfortunately her character doesn't make much sense she is a walking contradiction. Jones and the writer of PS couldn't decide whether they wanted to portray her as bright or downright moronic there is evidence for both. Her intelligence varies depending on the comedic necessities of the situationscene at hand i.e. they wanted to have their cake and eat it too. Her behaviour is puzzling she sometimes behaves as if she's totally new to the business and yet we are made to understand that she's been whoring around for many years at the point of her introduction.The plottwist involving Julie's maid Dolly did not work. It was obvious from the first moment that guy stepped onto the screen that Dolly was a he. Anyone who watched this movie and found themselves in surprise and shock when it was revealed that Dolly is a man needs to have their vision and perhaps even sexual orientation reexamined. It was akin to putting a wig and makeup on Danny de Vito and expecting that transformation to fool the viewer.At best PS is a semifailure as a comedy  but not without merit as a timefiller and certainly nicely filmed. There is little to nothing to learn from Jones's moral messages and there is far too little to laugh at. This subject matter had been covered with far more competence and depth in Working Girls a comedydrama indie film released just a year prior to this one. The notion that behind many chartered accountants wigged uptight judges and other upperclass professionals of social repute sexual perverts and ungratified deviates reside is one that Monty Python had already explored several decades earlier and with much more success. Still it's so much better than Eric the Viking. That one truly sunk Jones's flailing career as movie director.".

This being said know that it can easily offend.  Expect a movie that will get giggles out of a rape scene.  It is a no holds barred comedy that breaks ground that Happiness will sweep in to master.Polanski combines his psychedelic absurdity of The Magic Christian with the stark strangeness that he would later delve into in The Tenant.  It is a valiant attempt to create a surreal sexual comedy. For most films the lack of any depth to the characters will turn away even the most devoted viewer but What? creates entertaining caricatures that bobble and bump into one another with surprisingly charming results.  It is difficult to say whether this is a good film or not albeit it is shot beautifully and leaves the viewer with many a chortle but compared to the brilliance of his other films it seems a bit empty.  The film can be best likened to a scarred and matted alley cat that loves to come and visit.  It is rough on the edges and not nice to the touch but the affection it gives leaves the soft spots all the more appealing.".

It was a time for change a time for improvisation. It was in the spirit of those times that Polanski made What? What? could be defined as a surrealistic modern Alice in Erotic Land.An innocent young and beautiful American woman Nancy Sydne Rome  She is hitchhiking in Italy. The three men that gave her a lift try to rape her but they are in such a hurry and are so clumsy that one of them having lost his glasses begins to sodomize the other. A verbal fight ensues among them and in the confusion Nancy runs away. One of them runs after her. In her flight she sees a funicular waiting there for her as on purpose. The funicular takes her to a white villa.This villa is peopled by very bizarre characters. Nancy running away from the cruelty of the world has landed in the house of dreams. Is this her dream is she a dream dreamed by other people or both? This luxurious white villa located by the beautiful tyrrhenian sea seems very remote from everyday life. Among the characters there is a former pimp Alex Marcello Mastroianni two french lesbians a priest that watches everything with disapproving eyes the paraplegic patriarch of the house with his seriouslooking Nietzschereading German nurse and even Polanski is present as Mosquito that has no love left for Alex the pimp with whom he's always arguing.Nancy interpreted by the gorgeously beautiful Sydne Rome will be the object of desire of every male excepting maybe the priest inhabiting the villa. Even the growling dog falls under her charm and the same happened to me.Sydne Rome in an interview in the DVD released in Italy defined What? as an erotic dream. This is exactly what I think.Alex the pimp Marcello Mastroianni will persuade her to engage in kinky sexual games. But don't you expect the sleaze displayed by other Italian films of the time  by these standards What? can be considered tamer than its Italian brothers. Still in some scenes Sydne Rome is shown in the nude and in many others she's wandering around the house seminaked. In the strange sexual games that happen between her and Alex Sydne Rome has her clothes on. But believe me these scenes are very sensual. The beautiful Sydne Rome with her angel face and her large innocent eyes and Marcello Mastroianni wearing either a leopard skin or a Napoleon costume... well it's something to be seen and enjoyed! As Polanki has worked with a tight script and hasn't given much way to improvisation What? seems sometimes more a theater play than a film. The characters are like dream figures and the conversations are surrealisticsymbolic. What? is a surrealistic comedy which is based mainly on the actions and words of the characters as it happens in any good theater play. But don't get me wrong What? is a film and feels like a film. It's just that the words in What? seem to weigh more than necessary and stifle somewhat the spontaneity of the acting. Apparently the actors in the film were not given the freedom to improvise and this spoils the fluency and the dreamy atmosphere of the film.Take another Italian film made at the time  L'Occhio nel labirinto Blood by Mario Caiano. The script was probably hastily written. The characters are somewhat poorly developed the film is a giallo that has psychoanalytical motives  a labyrinth a killing loss of memory a white villa by the sea yes!. It has flashbacks fast handheld cameras following the characters and unveiling the landscape. The story may seem to some a patchup work  sex crimes psychoanalysis the beach and the sun mixed together  but the film is entertaining and intriguing even if it was made to earn a fast buck. The same cannot be said for What?.Polanski with What? wanted to make a sunny dreamy and sexy film and in a way he almost got there but if he had let himself really go and had given the actors more freedom .... What? could have been something! As it is What? is a halfsuccessful psychedelic film intellectual and slightly theatrical.In spite of all I think that What? is an interesting film  theatrically dreamy and psychedelic and very very sexy.".

Of course the sexual innocence of Sydne Rome put the film on the rank of erotic fantasy. The tribute to Alice is clear but it seems that the film may have influenced a great Italian erotic illustrator Milo Manara whose sexy heroins really look like Sydne Rome and are often place in similarly unvolontary sexual situations oooh the pooor girl lost her clothes what a shame!.

	schema:reviewBody "In my mission to watch every movie Roman Polanski has directed sooner or later I'd have to watch his least praised work. And What? may well be considered his worst movie. The 1986 parody Pirates surpasses this one quite easily. But Roman Polanski is such a good filmmaker even his worst efforts shine with talent intelligence and humor.Allegedly based on Alice's Adventures in Wonderland the movie opens with Nancy Sydne Rome a tourist traveling through Italian as we meet her she's about to be gang raped by a trio of sleazy Italians who gave her a ride. But she escapes and enters a villa by the sea. She has to take an elevator down to it and it's up to the viewer whether this underground journey represents Alice's falling down the rabbit hole or a descent to hell.Hell is perhaps too strong a word but the villa Nancy finds herself in is nevertheless populated by lost souls consumed by their fantasies perversions and excesses there's the lady who strolls naked the young man who can't stop thinking about sex the villa keeper always complaining about arthritis but with a knack for piano there's the owner Mr. Noblart Hugh Griffith who dies after asking Nancy to show him her boobs and vagina. Then there's Roman Polanski playing Mosquito who's called that way because of his big sting although it's not what you're thinking about. And finally there's the real star of the movie Marcello Mastroianni giving the movie's best performance as Alex a sadomasochist expimp who likes to be whipped while dressed as a tiger and doesn't mind abusing Nancy while dressed as a Navy admiral.What? is indefinable it has no plot no logic it flows like a dream and makes as much sense as one. The characters' personality changes all the time the absurd is always intruding and poor Nancy is caught in the middle. The movie is full of bawdy humor unapologetic sexism gratuitous nudity as the movie progresses Rome finds herself with less and less clothes until she's naked and silly violence.There are two types of strange in cinema there's mainstream strange  Terry Gilliam Tim Burton Charlie Kaufman for some reason people find these filmmakers difficult complex confusing when in fact they make a lot of sense by the end of the movie. But then there's the real strange the one that laughs at the childish simplicity of Gilliam and Burton and Kaufman. In that group there are movies like Wojciech Has' The Hourglass Sanatorium Jaromil Jires' Valerie and her Week of Wonders David Lynch's Eraserhead and Dusan Makavejev's Sweet Movie. Roman Polanski's movie belongs in this group.It's not for everyone which is a pity for underneath the nonsense there is a movie with a great sense of humor and beautiful cinematography.".

This may be a good idea. Nevertheless there are reasons why this film seems to haunt the fringes of the cinematic world. It has often been compared to Alice in Wonderland with its plot of a young girl being thrown into one crazy situation after another within a confined space. As for any possible meaning or symbolism behind these set pieces I have no clue.Perhaps we are not supposed to look too closely. Maybe this is Polanski trying to relax and make a comedy mixed inevitably with his trademark absurdity and sadness. In the end the traits which make Polanski unique remain visible despite the surface appearing much too seedy and unwholesome for the average film viewer. This is a film that cannot be recommended or hated only observed of how bizarre it truly is.".

There's an innocent girl in a strange place surrounded by crazy people but that's about the extent of the parallels. At best it's like Lewis Carroll reinterpreted by a horny high schooler who still giggles when he hears the word breast. Nevertheless for the first half hour or so I thought this was one of the funniest movies I had ever seen. Unfortunately it climaxed with Mastroianni crawling around in a tiger hide making meowing noises whereupon Rome starts taming him with the whip. After that the film never really recovers the energy it started out with and viewers are left with little to do but wonder how Rome will be humiliated next first her shirt is ripped then stolen then she walks around wearing a napkin until she finds another shirt but then her pants are stolen finally she loses the shirt etc. I love unadulterated nonsense SCHIZOPOLIS FORBIDDEN ZONE THE BED SITTING ROOM but aside from a couple of choice moments this film's particular pointlessness was lazy and uninspired.".

Roman Polanski's movie about a woman who unintentionally enters into an Italian villa filled with folks that Luis Bunuel might have concocted after a few Martini's and wonder what's the point? I suppose it's about collective andor random insanity and how the most unsuspecting intruder can get wrapped up in the mayhem. Or maybe it's an allegory for the era of 'do what you like' in a morbid paradise in the Italian coast with the rooms and balconies and beaches like another silent character. What is it? I can wonder this but what it comes down to is the movie is funny. It's funny because of the extremes Polanski and cowriter Gerard Brach take with characters and specific scenarios. Everybody at this villa where the protagonist arrives at is surely demented to one degree or another. There's the pimp played by Marcello Mastroianni who loves the feel of crushing ping pong balls with his feet dressing up as tigers and admirals for sexually sadomasochistic endeavors there's the guy who plays piano beautifully and doesn't respond when someone talks to him during his incessant playing there's Polanski himself playing a character named 'Mosquito' a fellow with a fake beard and a strange thing for Sydney Rome's character's jeans which he steals in her sleep. This doesn't even include random people like the woman walking around naked for no reason.There is no distinct plot but rather it follows that illogical line of logic one could find in the Exterminating Angel or Alice in Wonderland for that matter or perhaps as just a parody of the creation of a 'sex diary' that Rome carries on her person everywhere. Some lines fly over my head and others are some of the funniest and most cleverly deranged that Polanski's ever done. There's even time for the villa's wiseold dying patriarch with his bushy beard and eyebrows who nearly passes on on at a big dinner only to recover and become with obsessed with Rome's shirt.This all said it's not altogether excellent. Rome's performance wavers between competency and total flatness. That might have been what Polanski wanted she reminded on of a slightly cuter Elizabeth Berkley but aside from good looks there's not much going on for her here. The good news is the bevy of Italian character players people one's never seen before or nonItalian ones like Hugh Griffith hit their marks and can be hysterical on the whole.None however are quite as good as Mastroianni. As another proof of his genius as an actor he makes this perverted Don Jaun all his own. He's suave but in that slimy way like a permanently libidinous version of his sexual fantasies in 8 12. So that his sudden appearances qas he spies on Rome are funny on their own but one he gets into 'uniforn' in those sexrole play scenes particularly that tiger good Lord or fetishizes that ping pong ball it's a kind of outrageous perfection.What? isn't topshelf Polanski and there is something to it being unavailable for so long in the Unites States. But if you ca find it and are at least a decent fan of the director andor the star it's a hoot. That's what it is.".

Polanski a filmmaker that previously showed the world he could make great films then decides to make such a poor film as this. Then again this is a hippie film so for the times I guess it was ok.

Unlike Knife in the Water and some of the other subtitled films I have seen of his this has none of the beauty that I know he is capable of. This film is just appalling. This is probably because it is not just directed by him but written and produced also. It's a shame that we have his thoughts directed on celluloid as his thoughts are the worst thing about him  cue a very perverted film.I watched this in 2014 and it looked like it was made in the seventies not sure if shortly after the US Government tried to deport him but they should have based on this film alone. So how can I explain the story? Wideeyed beautiful blonde walks around an Amalfi villa halfnaked for two and a half hours saying and doing the dumbest  that I have ever seen on celluloid? No wait Dumb and Dumber just beat her but hey that's a spoof on stupidity this sadly isn't. To be honest I am embarrassed to be a woman and to watch this all the way through. My toes were curling and I am no sandalwearing feminist I just baulk at watching a woman being submissively whipped during sex and then telling her abuser she loves him.To sum this up the script could have been written by a teenager and some of the oneliners in it some by Mr Polanski are truly truly cringe worthy. I would recommend this film if I thought you could glean any filmmaking tips from it but this is no Tess or The Pianist. I think Mr Polanski had so many other things on his mind when making this film he forgot how to direct it. I didn't recognise any of his craftsmanship which is why I hired it in the first place. In keeping with Bitter Moon which was also another turkey avoid this film if you actually want some substance to your main character and some depth to the story.".

	schema:headline " A Fantastic Biopic on an Intriguing Figure but Not Without Flaws";
	schema:reviewBody "The Legend of Bhagat Singh is one of Indian cinema's most ambitious projects to date.  After three years of painstaking research and set construction veteran film maker Raj Kumar Santoshi and actor Ajay Devgan shot the film in a short stretch of six months.  The film released early due to competition from other films dealing with roughly the same subject.  Overall it's a pretty solid film but one can't help shake the feeling that it could have been a far superior product if it had been worked on for a short while longer.The film tells the entire life story of Indian freedom fighter and martyr Bhagat Singh who in a nut shell grew disillusioned with Gandhi's passive movement and lead an independent violent struggle against the British.Colonial India is recreated magnificently in the film and the British atrocities committed are portrayed with aplomb by the director.  One can truly get a sense of how such frustrating conditions could drive youngsters to violence and revolt.  Some of the film's strengths are its hard hitting portrayal of British atrocities its court scenes and its action scenes.The film's biggest highlight is its lead performer Indian actor Ajay Devgan.  The actor single handedly manages to uplift even the most dull and unconvincing scenes in the film to a high quality level.  His every expression and mannerism is carefully calculated to maximize his impact on the viewer.  This man can move audiences to tears or wide smiles with just a few short lines and quick glances from his intense eyes.  His work here is par excellence and can easily rival any work done by any gradeA actors the world over.The supporting cast is good as well with fellow revolutionary Sukhdev Indian stage actor Sushant Singh Bhagat Singh's mother Indian diva Farida Jalal leaving lasting impressions as well.The last excellent thing about the movie is the music by renowned composer A.R. Rahman.  The music is not as festive as Bollywood movies usually boast but that's to be expected considering the subject of the film.  The well crafted soothing ethnic tunes manage to evoke the right emotions without seeming rash and distasteful.The film isn't without its weaknesses however.  For one it's obviously a rushed effort.  Segments of the script seem under developed and the impact of certain national tragedies on Bhagat Singh's mindset is never fleshed out as one would want them to be.Also Bhagat Singh's political ideology he was a communist by the way is never really spelled out for viewers.  Instead they are left to put together pieces for themselves connecting the dots from dialogs and incidents in the film to really figure out the main character's mindset and view points.The second half of the film moves at an awkward pace sometimes lingering on minute details and other times racing ahead and skipping crucial events which are referenced in later dialog.  Finally for a film that remains very objective in presenting most events viewers will be surprised by a very negative portrayal of Mahatma Gandhi and India's first Prime Minister Nehru.  This angle of the film stuck out like a sore thumb to say the least.For all its faults however Legend of Bhagat Singh has plenty of strengths to make it a superb film.  It tells a great story with style and conviction. It has wonderful performances including one of finest performances ever in Indian cinema by Devgan.  It has great action moving drama soothing music and is overall a thoroughly rewarding and entertaining experience.  It comes highly recommended by me.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Legend of Bhagat Singh is one of Indian cinema's most ambitious projects to date.  After three years of painstaking research and set construction veteran film maker Raj Kumar Santoshi and actor Ajay Devgan shot the film in a short stretch of six months.  The film released early due to competition from other films dealing with roughly the same subject.  Overall it's a pretty solid film but one can't help shake the feeling that it could have been a far superior product if it had been worked on for a short while longer.The film tells the entire life story of Indian freedom fighter and martyr Bhagat Singh who in a nut shell grew disillusioned with Gandhi's passive movement and lead an independent violent struggle against the British.Colonial India is recreated magnificently in the film and the British atrocities committed are portrayed with aplomb by the director.  One can truly get a sense of how such frustrating conditions could drive youngsters to violence and revolt.  Some of the film's strengths are its hard hitting portrayal of British atrocities its court scenes and its action scenes.The film's biggest highlight is its lead performer Indian actor Ajay Devgan.  The actor single handedly manages to uplift even the most dull and unconvincing scenes in the film to a high quality level.  His every expression and mannerism is carefully calculated to maximize his impact on the viewer.  This man can move audiences to tears or wide smiles with just a few short lines and quick glances from his intense eyes.  His work here is par excellence and can easily rival any work done by any gradeA actors the world over.The supporting cast is good as well with fellow revolutionary Sukhdev Indian stage actor Sushant Singh Bhagat Singh's mother Indian diva Farida Jalal leaving lasting impressions as well.The last excellent thing about the movie is the music by renowned composer A.R. Rahman.  The music is not as festive as Bollywood movies usually boast but that's to be expected considering the subject of the film.  The well crafted soothing ethnic tunes manage to evoke the right emotions without seeming rash and distasteful.The film isn't without its weaknesses however.  For one it's obviously a rushed effort.  Segments of the script seem under developed and the impact of certain national tragedies on Bhagat Singh's mindset is never fleshed out as one would want them to be.Also Bhagat Singh's political ideology he was a communist by the way is never really spelled out for viewers.  Instead they are left to put together pieces for themselves connecting the dots from dialogs and incidents in the film to really figure out the main character's mindset and view points.The second half of the film moves at an awkward pace sometimes lingering on minute details and other times racing ahead and skipping crucial events which are referenced in later dialog.

The director seems to have done his homework properly. Very realistic sets appearance of characters. As far as story is concerned or better say truthfulness of the story is concerned history poses as one of the toughest problem. There is no going back. The conflict between Gandhi's nonviolence and Bhagat Singh's Tit for Tat philosophy is one of the most touching points of the movie. It eventually leads to execution of Bhagat Singh. How true is that? I am wondering and will always wonder with hope that either Gandhi or Bhagat Singh would come in my dreams and tell me what the truth was. But nevertheless it is a great movie to watch which will stir emotions. Ajay as Bhgat Singh is brilliant. He is among the finest actors in India indubitably. The other character that impresses is Sushant Singh who makes an impact with his intense performance. All in all all have done justice with their characters and fit well. Director did good home work and hence a movie that we should be proud of is out there on someone who is perhaps not internationally as famous as Gandhi but for sure was a great freedom fighter real patriot and a great son of Mother India.".

Raj Kumar Santhoshi is a director known for raising many quiescent questions and not supplementing the same with adequate answers but this film was entirely different. The director did the film under petrifying pressure rapidly racing it out with five other filmmakers in bringing the brilliant Bhagat to tinsel town. The superceding selection of authentic actors would have greatly given initial comfort to the director. Ajay Devgan as Bhagat Singh Susan Singh as Sukhdev Santhosh as Rajguru Akilendra Mishra as Chandrasekar Azad Raj Babbar and Farida Jalal as Bhagat's parents all of them made a mindblowing mark for themselves in this miraculous movie and in the history of Bollywood. The sub cast lead by Amrita Rao who plays fiance were no inferior in delivering the goods. A particular mention to be made of the jailor and the actors who played the roles of Emerson and Gandhiji .The soundest strength of the film was the amazing ability of Rajkumar Santhoshi to impeccably interweave sentiments and dramatic scenes amidst the course of the film  jubilantly justifying history all the way. The suitable sequences for the former fact are the court scene where gosh approves Sarfaroshi Ki Tamana song Bhagat's farewell to his mother etc. The cinematography and art direction have done wonderfully well to keep up with the classy cinema. The lyricist and dialogue writer have been efficiently equal to the tumultuous task and their resourceful role has been a pivotal point in the film. One phenomenal personality who had lent the cutting edge to this memorable movie is Music Midas' a r rahman. The way rahman marvelously meddles with our minds moods and music is yet another record of his activating ability and acquaintable acumen. He deserves a resolute round of applause for unbelievably using Sonu Nigam and Sukhwinder Singh. Though the film had not tipped TIPS the producers benevolently at the baffling box office the immaculate impact it created is not negligible. It is slowly and steadily creating a sound stardom for Bhagat Singh amongst the youth of the country which was the cause of the film.".

It would be only fair to say that Ajay's acting in this movie is at par with his role as Mallik in RGV's Company if not better. To get into the skin of such a legendary character and to act like him was an ardent task and Ajay looked effortless while doing the scenes which according to me would give the Khans a run for their money. I had tears in my eyes when the three martyrs break into that Rang de basanti mood in the climax. It will be remembered for a long long time from now. Last but not the least the supporting cast did a splendid job which is crucial in such a huge feature. Everyone lived out their respective characters. With special mention to the Court Room scenes and the Hunger strike scenes in the cell. There is a lot the young Indians should learn from this movie which in turn would make Bhagat's sacrifices worthwhile. A sure winner from the first shot to the last. A highly recommended must see which should get nothing less but 810.".

This is the story of the legendary Bhagat Singh and his friends a group of young boys who idolized Ghandhi as children but became disillusioned as they grew into teenagers and witnessed that none of Gandhi's peaceful tactics seemed to have worked on getting the British colonialists out of India nor stop the oppression. Steadily they begin to rebel and form their own group and politics and soon emerge as freedom fighters. The incomparable Ajay Devgan stars as the grown up Bhaghat Singh and he is just flawless he shoots this character into the stratosphere of acting that you eventually find yourself believing that this man might very well be Bhaghat Singh. He owns the character he becomes the character he inhabits the very essence of this freedom fighter and makes it his own life for the duration of the entire film. Amrita Rao is a dream to see a breath of fresh air after viewing hours of the violence bloodshed and senseless British nonsensical banter and poor excuse for logic.

He has tried to stay historically accurate and even though it was released during the same time as Guddu Dhanoa's snoozefest '1930 Shaheed' 'The Legend of Bhagat Singh' triumphs above that and is a masterpiece in comparison.Ajay Devgan though intense roles are his strength may seem like an odd choice to play the title role especially because there is no physical resemblance and he is too old for the part. Otherwise he delivers a winning performance. Sushant Singh and Akhilendra Mishra are equally powerful. The supporting cast that includes an excellent Raj Babbar a sincere Farida Jalal and dusky beauty Amrita Rao leave a mark. I liked the actress that played Durga who seems to be an important female figure in Indian history. I would like to see a movie about this woman. The actors who play the Brits are horrendous.The cinematography is fine and A.R. Rahman's soundtrack is another winner. Most of the songs are patriotic but there are a few different numbers too. The background score though beautiful is intrusive at times and kind of adds a melodramatic feel when that isn't necessary.'The Legend of Bhagat Singh' is one of the fewer biopics in Indian cinema that tells a good story while attempting to stay true to the facts. Some might find it difficult to watch due to the violent content but it is a movie that is worth viewing.".

	schema:reviewBody "The struggle for independence rested on the twin pillars of Gandhi's nonviolent protest and the 'titfortat by any means possible' protest spearheaded by Azad Bismil and Bhagat Singh. The Legend of Bhagat Singh traces the life and times of Bhagat Singh. The film starts as a jumbled collage of rapidly moving pictures shows a very young Bhagat Singh who is witnessing the Jallianwalla Bagh massacre in a surreal way then moves to his getting thoroughly disillusioned by the backtracking done by the Mahatma and picks up steam as the young college student Bhagat turns into a firebrand. A ragtag team of comrades gather and nucleate around Chandra Shekhar Azad to rob the train going through Kakori. Then Saunders is murdered by the revolutionaries. Finally in an attempt to show the nation that they are serious revolutionaries and not terrorists and to win popular support for their cause they blast a bomb in the assembly and are arrested. Many months in prison follow with deprivations a fast to improve conditions in jail torture and force feedings. The trio of Bhagat Rajguru and Sukhdev are sentenced to hang for the murder of Saunders but not before the nation is energized and change is in the air.Who will not be inspired by such a stirring tale that is reasonably well told? But I cannot help compare this tale to the one told to us by Manoj Kumar in Shaheed. This vibrant colorful tale pales in comparison to that stirring take in black and white so many years ago. It seems heavily inspired by the older film many songs and situations parallel the old. Sarfaroshi Ki Tamanna was not penned in that jail  so if it was an addon in Shaheed it was certainly copied from that version here. TLOBS falls short in a few areas  it is overly dramatized in many segments and this is a shortcoming for a film that has the backdrop of patriotic fervor. Even a subtle film will do the job and in fact might do it better as shown in Shaheed. The romantic interlude song was the most jarring why was the Punjabi Kudi dreaming a fantasy number in the Kashmir mountains? I would have been happy with Sarson Ke Khet. The last song and the trio walking through an interminable Bhool Bhuliaya of corridors was not needed. And why were the women folk on the outside? Was the hanging not moved forward by 12 hours? These faults in the scripting made the film seem like a hurried effort.The acting ranged from very good to OK. Sushant Singh did a very commendable job as Sukhdev as did Santosh as Rajguru Ajay started out shaky but settled into the role quite well by the end of the film. Akhilendra Mishra was excellent as Aazd. The entire British cast was abysmal and the court scenes were quite bad. Bhagat's family was very well depicted. All in all I think this was a decent and informative film but it could have been so much better if the director had been able to restrain the histrionics and the overly dramatic moments. I give it an A for effort but only a B for the overall film.A word about the music  I hate to say this as I think AR Rahman is a genius. But the way the familiar songs Sarfaroshi Ki Tamanna Pagdi Sambhal and Mera Rang De Basanti were composed made them seem distorted. I wish he had stayed with the original tunes. This ruined the soundtrack for me.".

	schema:headline " Epic Educational and Entertaining";
	schema:reviewBody "A historical is probably the toughest kind of film to make. One has to not only educate the viewer but also enlighten and entertain the audience. T.L.O.B.S scores in may fields but it works mainly because it tells a simple story of a complicated man with extreme sincerity. Story? Well if you're Indian and you don't know the story of Bhagat Singh  then you're probably not worth telling it to. If you're not Indian and you don't know the story  I strongly recommend you watch this one instead of reading my mediocre narration. T.L.O.B.S. takes us to the world of Bhagat Singh and a country under British Rule. That's another plus of the movie. It feels so real yet magnificent. I've always been a fan of Raj Kumar Santoshi and I feel the reason he stands out is because nobody can make a better hard hitting drama than him. In T.L.O.B.S. as well he gives us some shocking scenes and clapworthy dialogue. Bhagat Singh's transition into a fearless freedom fighter is shown with brilliance. Also the courtroom scenes are gripping due to powerful direction. There are some minor flaws here and there. The main problem I have with the film is in the narrative. Santoshi has packed a lot into the picture but he forgot to insert a few things that I felt were important since you're making a film on his life. First how did Bhagat feel when he cut his hair? What about his parents? Also Bhagat Singh's atheism is not explained well enough. I felt those things needed to be added in the film. There is also a point in the second half when one feels the narrative starts to stretch and nothing is happening. Editing is not crisp enough. The writing is terrific for the most part. The screenplay is straightforward and has only one objective  to tell a story of a legend. Another thing the film is not afraid to express itself but it also does not jump to conclusions. Note the scenes that feature Mahatma Gandhi. Those are some significant portions and they depict truth more than opinion. A.R. Rahman's music is underrated. In fact I liked most of the songs and I felt that they were not given enough appreciation but then again neither was this film. The technical aspects are all brilliant from cinematography to sound. I would like to point out another thing here  the background score is just out of this world.Santoshi always extracts the best performances from his actors and this film is no exception. The film belongs to Ajay Devgan and there should be no doubt. Before watching this I did not really see Ajay as a Bhagat Singh because despite him being a Sikh it did not suit him  but boy was I surprised. He puts even more life into an already powerful character. Just Amazing.Another performance I'd like to mention is of Sushant Singh  who I felt was another surprise. He's terrific. The guy who plays Rajguru is also efficient. Raj Babbar is a delight to watch and Farida Jalal is as always wonderful. Amrita Rao is okay. The hero her is Raj Kumar Santoshi over anybody else. A brilliant director who back to form after giving a few average to below average films in China Gate Pukar and Lajja. This is Santoshi at his best.Overall  A brilliant take on a freedom fighter that many have not justified. Ultimately the film motivates you to also tell the story of a legend named Bhagat Singh. 4.55".

He becomes a threat to the British Govt He and his friends are executed on March 23 1931 Bhagat Singh23 Shivaram Rajguru22 Sukhdev23These freedom fighters were forgotten by the main stream politiciansGhandhiNehruIt is pity on our government who has tried to hide the reality from the generations after Independence. They have made our great heroes terrorists in School books so that coming generations should not have much interest in reading about them.His History in written in his own blood a story of struggle friendship  One of the biggest betrayal by Ghandhi towards him and Indians";

The movie is a little too violent in nature for anyone too young. Hence small children should not see it. The movie shows how much so many suffered for Indian independence. The fehringee rule in colonial India was brutal barbaric and oppressive. The film doesn't hide this fact and the amount of violence towards the revolutionaries is difficult to watch because of its grotesqueness. However it was necessary so that the viewer gets an idea of the truth. This movie will bring any Indian to tears and make him realise the sacrifices made by our forefathers. 10 marks out of 10.".

The assassination they carry out follows a brutal massacre of numerous men women and children. The bombing is carried out in such a way to attract attention without killing or injuring. It is just a better feeling than I got in Rang De Basanti. In RDB the female lead is highly distressed by the use to which her movie is put. The women in The Legend of Bhagat Singh are simply frightened by the danger their men are courting. In the end they understand the nobility of the cause.Anyway this is just a much better movie.

If you are not an Indian watch it to know a revolutionary who is in the same league as Lenin or Che Guevara. If you are an Indian please show this to future generations. At present times when men of character have become scarce this can be a beacon of hope.This is not a movie it is a lesson in history sociology revolution and justice. Very few movies touch all subjects such a religion socialism justice revolution human emotions like this one. The characters give the same soul moving experience that few movies like Schindler's List and The man from Earth were able to achieve for me. This is a truly intelligent cinema far away from the singing dancing image of Bollywood. Rajkumar Santoshi deserves a standing applause for an honest depiction of the revolutionary and deserves better recognition. Ajay Devgn is almost an incarnation of the Legend of Bhagat Singh and has arguably given his best performance. If this was not history it would be tough to believe that Bhagat Singh achieved so much in so little time and young age. His autobiography Why I am an atheist proves that this movie has depicted him in true light. Men like Bhagat Singh come once in a millennium.The movie shows Bhagat Singh as a young child who witnesses atrocities and starts questing every aspect and practice in Indian society. This leads him to compare and question methods of leaders of that time. Bhagat Singh grew up in a time when men truly had character  the type of character that builds nations from ground up. His methods are truly ingenious and one is left to ponder how such a young mind could devise such ingenious instruments of revolution. The movie also urges the audience to think for themselves and poses questions that lead you to evaluate present day Indian society. One cannot help but ponder how Indian society would have turned up if Bhagat Singh had lived longer.SPOILER In the end the movie leaves the audience with a rhetoric Bhagat Singh Sukhdev and Rajguru were only 23 when they were hanged. They gave up their lives for the dream of a free and secular India.But today Indian society is ravaged by evils of Fundamentalism Communal hatred social injustice and corruptionHave we betrayed their sacrifices?".

Several people are consulted to determine what language the girl speaks including one language expert played by John Lithgow who is very funny especially when he tries to speak various languages.  The girl doesn't look Asian or Middle Eastern but if she's faking it as some suspect she's doing a good job.  She has a tattoo and strange religious customs that provide clues though the language in which she writes is not known to anyone. It is decided that she is speaking a dialect from Asia. When she does understand what is going on she comes across as quite charming.  Eventually it is determined that she must be a princess and her name seems to be Caraboo.Phoebe Cates gave a performance worthy of an Oscar nomination.  Whether her character did as well I won't say.  You'll just have to watch.I was worried when the movie wasn't funny at first but the humor came in large doses after a while and not the usual type of movie humor.  This was quite a sophisticated film considering it often tried to be silly and the costumes and the settings were very nice.  The music was magnificent whether highbrow classical or period music that sounded more like what ordinary people would enjoy.

	schema:reviewBody "Princess Caraboo is about the selfish and fashionable endeavors of the aristocracy of 19th century England about the role of true charity and from whence it comes and perhaps most of all it is about humankind's fascination with the story. Although we catch glimpses of and come to care for the true character of Caraboo Cates the movie's namesake serves mainly as a vessel through which the subject of the film can flow. In this movie a young beggar who speaks no English is taken in by a welltodo family and before long they have determined that she is a queen of the Orient. In no time she is the town's sensation and if nothing else living like royalty. Her story attracts the attention of a newspaper man Mr. Gutch played by Stephen Rea who in determinedly trying to discover the truth about Caraboo falls in love with her. He half hopes the legend is true half hopes that she's remarkable enough to have made up a story and a language and a manner to fool the very class she'd always been taught to fear and respect.I liked this movie for many reasons. It must be said that it's decidedly predictable but such is the case in movies that are not so much concerned with plot as with characters. The question is are the characters worth making a movie about? They are. Cates is delightful as always and in such a role in which she scarcely speaks she has the opportunity to shine and to demonstrate through action and manner her ability to act the part. Stephen Rea is never to be outdone and has a genuine ability to pull off passion in whatever role he plays. The British aristocracy is portrayed as largely grotesque and corrupt and mindnumbingly selfabsorbed.For my part I always appreciate a movie that doesn't revolve around romance and though this movie is touched with pieces of romanticism definitely a chickflick in certain ways it's not about the romance. It is instead about how the story completes us and how compelling the human imagination really is. Despite the moral values the film purports Princess Caraboo is not didactic and short on sappiness. I think Princess Caraboo is a delightful and beautiful tale and I recommend it to those who prefer the story to the action and who like to see the rich get theirs.".

Phoebe Cates is charming and the character actors notably Kevin Kline and Jim Broadbent are all splendid fun plus there's excellent cinematography from Freddie Francis.SPOILER ALERT The film is based on a true story in which early in the 19th century provincials around Bristol and the West Country in the UK were excited by the apparent appearance of a pretty oriental princess who had allegedly been kidnapped by pirates and had made her escape to England where she came under the protection of the Worralls Mr Worrall being a magistrate  not a banker as portrayed in the film. Eventually ten weeks later she was revealed as a fraud  she was in fact a certain Mary Baker  yet Mrs Worrall whose sympathy Mary kept even after being unmasked arranged for her to sail to Philadelphia. The film implies that she had been facing the death penalty for her deception and that she was to enjoy a new life in America. The truth more prosaically is that Mary Baker tired of life in the States after seven years and eventually returned to England in the 1820s where she died in 1865. All this info can be found at httpen.wikipedia.orgwikiPrincessCaraboo and at httpwww.museumofhoaxes.comhoaxHoaxipediaPrincessCaraboo All this rather underlines that the filmmakers have taken this curious story and given it a harder spin against the English 'establishment' notably the aristocracy in the form of the prince regent who is purposely made to look ridiculous a point underlined as 'Caraboo' is apparently faced with the choice of the noble Irish journalist and the foppish and ridiculously dressed up prince. There's no evidence that the historic Caraboo came within spitting distance of the aristocracy though the British press of the time gleefully had a field day over the gullibility of the local upper classes of Bristol and the surrounding region. Also I'm afraid the contrast of nobleinnocent Irishmen one of Caraboo's fellow inmates is  surprise surprise  an innocent Irishman versus evil English powerthatbe the only sympathetic English person who isn't a servant is Mrs Worrall is becoming a tired clich.

Philippe planned to save his sailing plans with friends by sending fat nerd Stephane Michonnet to England using his name which comes out when Michonnet gets indigestion. Meanwhile Charles expects his spoiled favorite son Grard who tells daddy about all the other schoolboys for money to chaperon Shirley the daughter of his English counterpart MacFarrell but the girl gets all French boys horny so even his perfect record is soon gravely soiled as dad spies on them and he and Shirley join Philippe and his friends.

	schema:headline " Mildly amusing but it doesn't deliver what the score and the poster make you expect...";
	schema:reviewBody "The Exchange Student won the Golden Ticket in 1967 it was the movie that attracted the highest number of viewers it also marks the fourth time in a row that this feat is achieved by a De Funs comedy forgive the pleonasm. Indeed the last two years were his classic works with Grard Oury The Sucker and The Great Stroll the most successful French movie of all time before being dethroned in 2008 by Dany Boon's Welcome to the Ch'tis and before them Jean Girault first opus of the Troops series the Gendarme of St Tropez. Fourth time's a charm. It wouldn't happen in 1968 because you just can't beat Walt Disney The Jungle Book attracted 14 million people twice more than any De Funs movie but still less than The Great Stroll.Now why should I always bring up these ponderous statistics when I review a De Funs movie to be honest it's because I don't feel much like reviewing this film and I'm just gaining space and time. But if there's a point I'm trying to make is that De Funs' bankable status had firmly been established that it happened with two different directors proved was definitely De Funs' talent that attracted the viewers. But 1967 marks a real turn the top movies of 64 65 and 66 were objectively the best and are still regarded as De Funs most defining and iconic works The Exchange Student is a good movie that delivers a fair share of laughs but 'legendary' isn't a word I'd use to describe it.The film has a nice little premise that allows De Funs not to rely much on his expected gimmicks you know the overthetop reactions the grimaces and gesticulations he's rather quite restrained and it pays off most of the times. It is also the first film where Claude Gensac plays his wife and the chemistry is obvious and would never lack in their next collaborations she'll be his wife in the next 'Troops opus the year after. It also features one of the most defining scores of the 60's as Raymond Lefvre's tempo carries all the joy and exhilaration of this period whether we're talking of the summer vacations' start of the sixties in France. The set up is all wellmade De Funs is a tyrannical head of a prestigious boarding school with a rebellious son who got lousy marks in English so he sends him for an exchange program with an English student. The son wants to sails across the Seine so he sends one of his friends to take his place meanwhile the English girl comes and it's a matter of a few scenes before she has a love at first sight with De Funs' son and leaves the school. Worried about the negative publicity he goes looking for them. The plot bears too much resemblance to his chase after his daughter in The Troops in New York or to the designer of his ship in the Little Swimmer. After two classic road movies with De Funs the concept starts to wear down a little and watching De Funs harboring different disguises isn't the kind of roaring laughter material it used to be.This is not to say that there's not much to enjoy in The Exchange Student the film is like a time capsule of an innocent France circa 1967 and it features a few interesting moments of clashes between French and British culture at a time where France was overflown by the Beatlemania and the rise of the miniskirts. The interactions between De Funs and Ferdy Mayne who plays the girl's father provide some of the film's best moments. But the film is more of a product of its era a sort of illustration of the kind of movies they used to make but it doesn't really stand on its own right as a mustsee De Fune's movie you can listen to the score on Youtube watch a few clips you wouldn't miss much. It's so forgettable that I even wish it was a little worse so I could care about explaining while it's not good. But here's an example there's a funny character in the movie the housemaid she desperately wants to show a sailor uniform to the British hosts which in the context of the film is a rather incriminating piece. De Funs closes the door on the uniform and she keeps pulling it naturally the funniest thing he can do is to open the door. But then do we need to watch her being pushed down to the bed and lose consciousness the sight of a door opening and hearing her losing her balance would have been enough but subtlety has never been Girault's strongest suit. The bar brawl that occurs halfway through the film is another instance asking for our indulgence.And the film is not even that bad it just mild and innocent entertainment. Even Olivier de Funs as the younger son is being given the ungrateful role of the buttkisser while he looked nothing like a snitch he'd have better pairing with his father in the 70's but his presence also indicates that De Funs gained more nepotistic power and influence but I wouldn't consider him accountant for the film's lack of entertainment he's actually the best thing about the film he made me wonder if I wouldn't enjoy a school session with him rather than all the sailing trips with boring predictable youth.".

It's very cool to discover their fashion the music revolution and the youth getting their liberty ! Here Fufu plays a tyrannical schoolmaster father and husband ! His extraordinary talent is to play him with a lot of humanity and silliness so at the end his character is engaging ! Another cool thing with Fufu is that as an actor he likes to play inside a family his working one his wife the strong man the English girl  as well as the real other. Like the best comedy there is a real plot to build the action and it's not an endless bit of chunks ! With the movie we visit the country side near Paris Normandy London and even Scotland ! It's really funny totally absurd and accurate with the human nature. If i don't rate  10  it's only because the last part of the movie with the Scottish folklore is too much action even if the English actor is really good to act with Fufu !

Instead he gets involved into an affair with a younger woman Judith played with multi talented Carole Bouquet. Their love affair does not make much sense and since doubt enters his mind the writer engages Anna Maria a private investigator a woman who was Judith's lover to look into her imaginary affair that has been bothering Francis. Andre Dussolier had the difficult assignment of baring it all in a couple of nude scenes where a much modest Carole Bouquet keeps on her clothes.

He meets Bouquet the real estate agent showing him possible living accommodations and they seem to hit it off. This takes place amidst the spectacular cinematography of the outlying waterways of Venice where both ocean liners and small boats coexist.He says he will rent the very expensive home she's showing him if she will move in with him. After thinking about it and consulting with a friend and former lover of hers portrayed by Adriana Asti she accepts.However we quickly learn this idyllic setting in the early parts of the film will not last long. As various characters come in and out of the movie I found almost all of them to be very unlikeable and some of their actions to be actually despicable.For example when Dussollier's daughter portrayed by Melanie Thierry comes to visit him and Bouquet who are now married she ends up completely disappearing and abandoning her young daughter and husband. When Dussollier hires Asti a former Private Investigator to find her Asti discovers she has run off with a drug dealer. Later Thierry ends up sending her father a porno tape of her and the drug dealer just to infuriate him as apparently they've had a long history of conflicts.This is just one example of many. The acting and the dialogue are strong and as mentioned the cinematography is wonderful but I found by the end of the movie I really didn't care what happened to any of these people.Also a note of caution There is a scene in the film where a dog is suddenly murdered and I found this to be brutal to have witnessed.In summary this French drama left me as cold and unfeeling as the people in it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jeff Daniels has been the type of actor whose films are always shown on The Late Late Movie.  His career has been built as playing the normal guy in increasingly odder movies.  He's taken on the Bmovie genre Arachnophobia trippy cult scifi Disaster in Time nostalgiafueled Woody Allen comedies The Purple Rose of Cairo and even the occasional abominable romance Love Stinks The Butcher's Wife.  And then there's Something Wild a film which defies any possible classification.  It's a love story a road movie a thriller a comedy of errors an 80's movie and most of all it's a Jonathan Demme movie.Made in 1986 the film has a logical kind of prethinking which is both subtle and amazing.  Daniels plays Charlie Driggs an uptight New York City businessman whose life goes into overdrive when he meets Lulu Melanie Griffith a wacky free spirit with a pair of handcuffs a bottle of Scotch and a sexuality which seems to be inspired not by the Madonnaesque charades of the time but on past screen legends as Louise Brooks and Mae West. After meeting in a corner restaurant where it seems all of the customers have their own interesting stories to tell Demme and screenwriter E. Max Frye focus on these two people and the various destinies their meeting awaits the least of which involves Lulu's exhusband Ray Liotta fresh out of prison and demanding an explanation for Lulu's fading love for him.Of course I'm making this film seem like another one of those standard Hollywood claptraps.  Yet it's not.  Together with regular cinematographer Tak Fujimoto Demme plunges us into a world which seems at first like a homespun portrait of Americana complete with minor characters who seem to have life beyond the screen the Motel Philosopher John Waters' crooked car salesman Charlie's protege and his very pregnant very introverted wife Lulu's unexpectedly wise mother.  Later however the film uses its keen sense of characterization to subtly show the effects of the various kindnesses of strangers the gasstation attendant the little girl outside the church a naive teen named Tracy.  All of this is done in a style that is both unique and mesmerizing as Demme keeps shifting the gears of his story so the audience doesn't know what will happen next.And then there's the Liotta character.  This is one of the great supporting performances of contemporary cinema as Liotta's presence lets another dimension of atmosphere pervade its way through this already quirky filmlifting it beyond the ranks into greatness.  Displaying a level of intelligence which is both dangerous and striking Liotta conjures up a performance which he would later reprise in Jonathan Kaplan's inferior Unlawful Entry a film which unfortunately did considerably better at the box office than this one.  Nevertheless Liotta proves exactly what Scorsese saw in him when he was casting Goodfellas his smarmy underhandedness and sneaky intrusions would prove similar to those he would display playing Henry Hill in that Mafia masterpiece.Another one of Something Wild's many strengths is its soundtrack.  The film contains many of what I have described as 30second rock interludes but in this case it's done with so much style and cinematic knowhow that it does not take away from the story.  Instead Demme uses the stereotype that many of his MTVobsessed colleagues employed and turns it on its head. Instead of using music for music's sake Demme uses an eclectic mix of reggae Sister Carol Jimmy Cliff UB40 oldies many performed by the Feelies during the reunion sequence and Laurie Anderson and John Cale's solo guitar riff and blends the sound to the images so it looks as if the film is being told by a pseudoGreek chorus of AfricanAmerican subculture which stands apart from this story of libidos and materialism run awry.This film is shown on Comedy Central many many times.  However it has been severely edited due to commercial restraints and is also shown during the wrong time of day.  This is a midnight movie a film which is meant to be discovered while flipping the dials on your television set during restless bouts of insomnia. Like Blade Runner and The Rocky Horror Picture Show this cult movie feeds upon a nocturnal atmosphere and is as a result all the more effective.  I haven't even mentioned Griffith's performance which is her best even better than Working Girl.  Her squeaky voice and demeanor hints at oceans of emotion behind this problematic woman and you find yourself caring for this mismatched couple even as Liotta terrorizes the screen.  Friends? Liotta asks Daniels manipulating his thoughts so easily that Daniels hardly knows what to say or what to do.  The audience sits spellbound experiencing the same degree of uncertainty over this eccentrically exquisite movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sometimes you have to search high and low but you really can find some interesting films made in the late 1980s. Though Jonathan Demme's film is not perfect it still brilliantly outshines most of the crud made back then. Something Wild is the study of two souls who seem to come from different worlds going on a crazy road trip full of sex violence and even a high school reunion.It all begins inside a tiny diner in New York City when openly freespirited Audrey Melanie Griffith notices yuppie Charlie Jeff Daniels sneak out on paying his bill. She confronts him outside and the two of them end up jumping in her car and taking off on a sunny Friday afternoon. At first it would seem that this trip across the state line will merely end in a sexual tryst in a cheap motel but little does Charlie know Audrey has all sorts of plans for him that weekend. After some serious hankypanky Audrey takes Charlie back to her home town introduces him to her mother as her husband and then takes him to her high school reunion. In a development a little bit contrived for this critic's liking one of Charlie's coworkers also happens to be attending this reunion. This could potentially destroy the facade of the family man on a wild weekend that Charlie is trying to perpetrate. at this point we learn his wife left him quite a while ago Further complicating matters is the arrival of Audrey's psychotic exhusband played with fearsome intensity by Ray Liotta. From that point on this film which has largely gone for laughs becomes rather intense and often violent.This film scores major points by absolutely keeping the audience guessing. At least until the third act when the film can likely conclude in no other way than it does. The film avoids making Charlie out to be a totally predictable sap who is just along for a wild ride with a crazy woman. Charlie has his own secrets and a whole hidden side of his own that comes out when it has to. Demme places some marginally famous people in some truly odd cameos and spends a little bit more time with peripheral characters than some people would. It gives the film a very human kind of feeling as we get to know at least a little something about even someone working as a waitress or at a motel. The film maybe meanders a bit here and there but that is understandable since so much of it plays out like a road trip. The actors are exceptional and the film is full of color and energy. Highly recommended. 9 of 10 stars.The Hound.".

	schema:headline " an aboveaverage romcom script crossbred with juicy pulp fiction great stuff";
	schema:reviewBody "Why can't more romantic comedies be like this? This question came to me while watching Something Wild a little sleeper from the mid 80s from Jonathan Demme about a seemingly typical 80s NY businessman Charlie Jeff Daniels who gets whisked away by a 'freespirit' Lulu Melanie Griffith. Well probably because most people who watch the very typical romantic comedies probably don't watch it for the same reasons that those who love Something Wild do. There's maybe something to keep going through the dirge of crap that are among the films of decades and decades of romantic comedies but it's finding one of the nuggets that counts Love Actually from 2003 is another one for example. And perhaps there might be a darker sensibility or more thought put into it in enjoying Something Wild.It's a lot like IdgoneWild in a sense. In the world of Something Wild we're brought along with characters on a situation that would seem surreal on a Bunuel level i.e. bourgeois brought along into the realm of sin and desire by some freewill temptress of the 'lower depths' but there's a reality to it a kind of downtoearth level about the characters and more importantly for this the actors playing them and it elevates it past being either too strange or just too quirky. It's just about right which is tough to dol you feel like cringing as Lulu calls up Charlie's boss while teasing him incredibly in the midst of kinky sex but it's also so funny in how it all comes together that you just don't care at least enough that it's anarchic.So while it's enjoyable at least on first sight as a sort of freewheeling existentialist romp like a French sex comedy clipped over on the 80s 'greedisgood' motto it has dark undertones that soon get darker and darker thanks to Ray Liotta's Ray who is LuluAudrey's real husband. At this point we feel like we're suddenly plopped into a pulp fiction piece with the excon badass going to town against the wouldbe rebel and his girl gone awry. But at the same time for what Demme and his wonderful screenwriter have it all works. What helps exponentially if that's the word is that Demme doesn't stray either into anything not honest within the boundaries of this situation. It might seem like a risk people wouldn't take in real life or that the violence is pumped up to again pulp fiction territory but in the logic of the piece of the tricky deceit and the pushandpull of the triangle of CharlieAudreyRay it's just awesomely achieved.Again the performances are a big asset to the film's suceess. Daniels matches very well that line between playing it innocent and the straightshooter the guy we're supposed to identify with as stuck middleclass citizens with families and green lawns and as a rebel who just has to let some free will into his system now and again.

	onyx:emotionText "Why can't more romantic comedies be like this? This question came to me while watching Something Wild a little sleeper from the mid 80s from Jonathan Demme about a seemingly typical 80s NY businessman Charlie Jeff Daniels who gets whisked away by a 'freespirit' Lulu Melanie Griffith. Well probably because most people who watch the very typical romantic comedies probably don't watch it for the same reasons that those who love Something Wild do. There's maybe something to keep going through the dirge of crap that are among the films of decades and decades of romantic comedies but it's finding one of the nuggets that counts Love Actually from 2003 is another one for example. And perhaps there might be a darker sensibility or more thought put into it in enjoying Something Wild.It's a lot like IdgoneWild in a sense. In the world of Something Wild we're brought along with characters on a situation that would seem surreal on a Bunuel level i.e. bourgeois brought along into the realm of sin and desire by some freewill temptress of the 'lower depths' but there's a reality to it a kind of downtoearth level about the characters and more importantly for this the actors playing them and it elevates it past being either too strange or just too quirky. It's just about right which is tough to dol you feel like cringing as Lulu calls up Charlie's boss while teasing him incredibly in the midst of kinky sex but it's also so funny in how it all comes together that you just don't care at least enough that it's anarchic.So while it's enjoyable at least on first sight as a sort of freewheeling existentialist romp like a French sex comedy clipped over on the 80s 'greedisgood' motto it has dark undertones that soon get darker and darker thanks to Ray Liotta's Ray who is LuluAudrey's real husband. At this point we feel like we're suddenly plopped into a pulp fiction piece with the excon badass going to town against the wouldbe rebel and his girl gone awry. But at the same time for what Demme and his wonderful screenwriter have it all works. What helps exponentially if that's the word is that Demme doesn't stray either into anything not honest within the boundaries of this situation. It might seem like a risk people wouldn't take in real life or that the violence is pumped up to again pulp fiction territory but in the logic of the piece of the tricky deceit and the pushandpull of the triangle of CharlieAudreyRay it's just awesomely achieved.Again the performances are a big asset to the film's suceess. Daniels matches very well that line between playing it innocent and the straightshooter the guy we're supposed to identify with as stuck middleclass citizens with families and green lawns and as a rebel who just has to let some free will into his system now and again. Griffith is in one of her very best not acting too precocious or annoying and conveying in the little bits of 'regular' Audrey i.e. the scene at her mother's that there's more than meets the eye. And Liotta is so great that it's probably no wonder that he maybe unfortunately got typecast as a psycho. There's actually complexity that Liotta gets to and in a way doesn't make Ray totally unlikeable he is the villain of course but there's a charm that is like the ID unraveled completely as a guy who shoots guns robs stores and hits on girls whenever he can.

Lulu offers a ride for him in her convertible but she abducts Charles and they go to a motel in New Jersey where they spend the night together. On the next morning she heads to her hometown in Pennsylvania to spend the weekend with Charlie.

Audrey does not tell Charlie who Ray is and Charlie accepts Ray's invitation to drink some beer with him and his date Irene Margaret Colin. After a while Ray becomes violent hits Charlie and kidnaps Audrey. But Charlie does not intend to give up on her. Something Wild is one of my favorite films and one of the best cult movies of the 80's. I have just watched this film at least for the sixth time and I still love it. The sweet and gorgeous Melanie Griffith has one of the best performances of her career in the role of a young woman detached in a moment from the social conventions and extremely conservative when she meets her mother. Lulu is a reference to Louise Brooks' character in Pandora's Box. Jeff Daniels is also excellent and very funny in the role of a naive and silly executive that finds that is better off feel like a live dog than a dead lion. Ray Liotta is also fantastic in the role of a cynical scum. The screenplay divides the story in two parts and fight in Charlie's house is impressively realistic. Last but not the least the soundtrack is fantastic. My vote is nine.Title Brazil Totalmente Selvagem Totally WildNote On 18 August 2014 I saw this movie again.".

	schema:reviewBody "Not even remotely corny like one would expect of a 1980s romantic comedy this fierce libidinous entertainment stars Jeff Daniels as Charlie an externally buttondown banker whose mojo is readily fluttered by audacity in women and Melanie Griffith as Lulu an alcoholic sex machine with an amply fertile mind. Daniels plays some of the same notes here that he used in Terms of Endearment where he was the firm competent straitlaced husband and father who liked to have relations with perky coeds. He looks like he was born to wear a suit and a tie but he has that insubordinate glint in the right light. Griffith's performance is founded not so much on sexual excitement as on nerve She is able to persuade us and Daniels that she is likely to do almost anything particularly if she thinks it might shock him.Even while they're standing on the sidewalk in front of that restaurant and she's making like she's charging him with theft there's a spark between them. The casting is critical in a movie like this. There has to be some kind of brutish cohesion between the man and the woman or it doesn't make any difference how sharp the dialogue is. Once they've made their connection Daniels freely goes along for the ride. After awhile she even takes his handcuffs off although he sort of liked the idea of having lunch in a restaurant with the cuffs dangling from one of his wrists.They drive down the East Coast from New York to Tallahasee while she steals money from cash registers and he capsizes into the conscious daydream of the sensually exhausted. At Griffith's high school reunion Daniels runs into the last person he wants to see the accountant from his office. And Griffith runs into the last person she wants to see her husband Ray Liotta. I will stop here. The uncertainty of the tension must not be ruined.If Demme and screenwriter E. Max Frye had developed this movie as a madcap comedy it most likely wouldn't have worked as well. Their feat is to think their characters through before the very first scene. They know all about Charlie and Lulu and so what happens after the confrontation outside that restaurant is virtually inescapable cnsidering who they are and how they look at each other. This is one of those few movies where the story acts shocked by what the characters do and not the other way around.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's easy to take actors like Ray Liotta and Jeff Daniels for granted with the benefit of hindsight. Both of them have had ups and horrible downs crossing genres seamlessly or inexplicably. It can also be argued that neither one of them has been more gratifying more liberated more well wild than in their breakthrough roles in Johnathan Demme's road movie. With the help of Melanie Griffith's femme fatale they make a very interesting movie about finding your wild side but also finding out about the nasty underbelly lurking beneath society's pickett fences.After being accused of ripping off a diner a yuppie accountant named Charles sets off on a wild road trip with the freespirited Lulu. Along the way she manages to bring out something special in Charlie accusing him of being a closet rebel. They decide to get themselves in various troublesome situations like running out on roofsplittingly expensive restaurants. They soon run into trouble however when a former love of Lulu's or Audrey's Ray turns up at her high school reunion after what appears to be done time in a jail.Demme's film switches from screwball situation comedy to black farce and then to an uncomfortable menace. At times we're not really sure what this woman wants with Charles whether she is after money scheming or indeed really has fallen for our floppyhaired protagonist. Daniels injects his hapless hero with all the dopey charm and middleclass wit one could ever hope to see in an 80s suitwearing yuppie. He wants to eschew his suburban divorce style for a rebellious wildatheart rebel and insists upon doing it with the impulsive slightly reckless but utterly alluring Lulu. The problem is when he discovers his wild side he has to deal with the ensuing problems He's just been made VicePresident at his firm  What would his work mates think? How does he deal with the psychotic excon boyfriend? Does he really know what this woman wants? He appears for most of the movie to be a sap who could fall for more than he could handle. But coincidentally he's a pretty good liar so maybe he's no better than the rest of them.But even if the underlying philosophy doesn't hit you then the comedic setpieces definitely should. One particular scene involving handcuffs suspenders a dinky motel and a a phone call to his work office particularly sticks in the mind. It's not often you get movies like this. Movies that share a good balance between intelligence and farce. How can you go wrong?".

A stranger Lulu Melanie Griffith notices this and correctly surmises that he's a closet rebel kind of guy. He's the perfect guy whom she can fit into her plans so she sort of abducts him and makes him pose as her husband. However the guy whom she is actually still married to an exconvict named Ray Sinclair Ray Liotta in his breakthrough film performance shows up and things take an uglier turn.As written by E. Max Frye and directed by the talented veteran Jonathan Demme Something Wild is engaging for quite a while. It manages to be pretty zany in spirit and somewhat unpredictable. Daniels who's often made a career out of playing straight arrow types and the kooky delightful Griffith who sports a brunette wig at first work decidedly well together. One is amused by their misadventures and wondering what sort of mess that Lulu will next create for Charles. However the film is somewhat overlong and changes tone for its second half for a much more conventional narrative of Ray dominating the proceedings and occasionally terrorizing Charles. Not to mention Charles taking quite a shine to Lulu and refusing to let her go without some sort of fight.Fortunately Daniels and Griffith are so utterly engaging that they make this trip worthwhile. Liotta is a powerhouse in the role of the volatile husband I'm sure that back then theatre goers and critics alike could see that this guy was going places. Lovely Margaret Colin is good in an underwritten role and is unceremoniously dropped from the story. One other complaint that this viewer had was that this cast features some top notch character players  Tracey Walter Charles Napier Robert Ridgely  and director cameos John Sayles as a motorcycle cop John Waters as a used car salesman and then makes such brief use of them. One might wish that they had more to do.The eclectic soundtrack is solid accompaniment for this generally agreeable movie. It may not move that well but it does come up with some very nice moments along the way.Seven out of 10.".

Daniels is always an affable and easy to watch actor and nothing changes here but it's Griffith and an early Liotta turn that steals the show. Griffith is a ball of sexuality and she looks fabulous into the bargain. Her Audrey AKA Lulu has a few layers that need to be peeled by Griffith and she does it with style. Liotta serves notice of what was to come four years down the line when a certain Mr Scorsese came calling. Menacing yet fun into the bargain it's very much the perfect Liotta role. Demme paints an interesting picture as he blends yuppiedom with rebellious excess the result being a quirky little number that save for an inevitability that comes with the finale is a rewarding time fulfilling experience.

Silence of the Lambs remains Demme's only good film and I'm of course including all the overrated leftwing exercises in bigscreen indulgence some of which I haven't seen  and never will.This is a light comedy that takes a thriller turn somewhere halfway. The first half is a little hard to sit through it's neither funny nor particularly interesting. Daniels plays an overthetop dumbasdirt naive moron who is so gullible and trusting that it defies belief. His animated acting is often annoying and barely funny. He actually lies to Griffith at the outset and tells her that he is married with children when in fact he is divorced! In all the history of mankind and movies any man who is married and meets a woman he likes will lie  if he lies  and say that he ISN'T married. Later on the notatall credible or believable rationale behind this was revealed he wanted to protect himself. What a load of crap... The fact that his character makes all the wrong decisions and does all the dumb things in the movie made me actually look forward to Liotta pounding on him when he caught up with him in the former's apartment.What then happens in Daniels's apartment is the classic endofmovie fighttothedeath which the good guy  albeit the very dumb good guy  predictably wins. Still at least the last halfhour has some action something going on and Daniels isn't given any more the opportunity to be animated. The film lacks credible characters whether main or marginal and the feel of it is too 80s which means the movie has a rather bland look visually ugly. Sayles yet again makes a cameo as a policeman. The film is also perhaps a bit too heavy on the coincidences side. Griffith once again plays a softtalking dumbsounding bimbo but as usual she is convincing because she IS a softtalking dumbsounding bimbo. This was an earlier film before her lipenlargement and breastenlargement surgery compare the natural breasts she exposes in this film to the readytoexplode balloons she briefly flashes years later in Nobody's Fool.If you're interested in reading my biographies of Griffith and other Hollywood intellectuals contact me by email.".

First she is a selfconfident woman who sees no problem in violating all types of norms and rules and then she becomes a woman who is so defensive about many things and almost inert. Her resoluteness and courage go away and her strong attitude is replaced by a passive one. Meeting with Ray does not seem sufficient to me in explaining the whole transformation. I am also frustrated by Melaine Griffith's acting. I guess she fails to make either sides of her character come alive. She plays both parts in a surprisingly similar way. So much so that one can easily see the commonalities between Lulu and Tess McGill in the Working Girl which is another terrible movie of hers.Apart from acting by the way i should say that it is not only Griffith Jeff Daniels and Ray Liotta are equally bad in this movie too I think there is a bigger problem about the story which in fact makes the acting to appear even worse. I am not sure if Demme's intention was to combine a romantic comedy with a short thriller in order to play with the boundaries of the genre of romantic comedy. If it was his idea he managed to do it but the result is quite bad. I do not understand the value of cheesy romantic comedies so I am having difficulties in understanding why it does matter to play push its boundaries. At the end of the day this movie is a nonentertaining romantic comedy ends with happyending with some extra action in the middle.Final remarks on Criterion Collection. I watched this movie mainly because they published it. I usually like the movies in their collection but this was one of the few movies that disappointed me. My disappointment was bigger probably because my expectations were higher. I will continue watching their movies I hope I do not bump into a major failure like this any more.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the kind of movie that could have ruined several careers if garbage could ruin motion picture careers these days.Melanie Griffith took off her shirt and in her preenhancement surgery days she really should have stayed dressed.Jeff Daniels was completely wasted but fortunately for him and for us he has gone on to much better NOTE ADDED in 2014 and some much worse things since this ... this ... this ... well heck piece of garbage.Strangely all of its major participants have gone on to bigger and better things including director Jonathan Demme. His work here was also wasted but deserving of a grudging admiration. I mean anything not worth doing is not worth doing well. But he did it well anyway.Still there was one bright shining aspect Ray Liotta who is named way down the credit list just absolutely stole everything. Liotta was magnificently mesmerizing! Hypnotic! Enthralling.I saw this piece of garbage while it was still relatively new in a friend's private theater. For some strange reason my friend LOVED it. I sort of think it's because Melanie Griffith took off her shirt and really honest she shouldn't have though he tried to claim it was other more artistic reasons.Anyway I thought even then after his first scene that Ray Liotta would become a major star or at least a major highlyrespected actor.Despite the garbagey aspects of the garbagey script the sheer ugliness of the whole story Liotta made it almost worth watching. In fact it is worth seeing once just to see how far Ray Liotta has come. I mean for one thing his name is now usually listed at or near the top.Even then even in a pile of garbage Ray Liotta shone like a diamond.Just if you do see this trash be prepared to hold your nose. Every major character is either amoral or immoral. Terrible movie.

	onyx:emotionText "This is the kind of movie that could have ruined several careers if garbage could ruin motion picture careers these days.Melanie Griffith took off her shirt and in her preenhancement surgery days she really should have stayed dressed.Jeff Daniels was completely wasted but fortunately for him and for us he has gone on to much better NOTE ADDED in 2014 and some much worse things since this ... this ... this ... well heck piece of garbage.Strangely all of its major participants have gone on to bigger and better things including director Jonathan Demme. His work here was also wasted but deserving of a grudging admiration. I mean anything not worth doing is not worth doing well. But he did it well anyway.Still there was one bright shining aspect Ray Liotta who is named way down the credit list just absolutely stole everything. Liotta was magnificently mesmerizing! Hypnotic! Enthralling.I saw this piece of garbage while it was still relatively new in a friend's private theater. For some strange reason my friend LOVED it. I sort of think it's because Melanie Griffith took off her shirt and really honest she shouldn't have though he tried to claim it was other more artistic reasons.Anyway I thought even then after his first scene that Ray Liotta would become a major star or at least a major highlyrespected actor.Despite the garbagey aspects of the garbagey script the sheer ugliness of the whole story Liotta made it almost worth watching. In fact it is worth seeing once just to see how far Ray Liotta has come. I mean for one thing his name is now usually listed at or near the top.Even then even in a pile of garbage Ray Liotta shone like a diamond.Just if you do see this trash be prepared to hold your nose. Every major character is either amoral or immoral. Terrible movie. Terrible movie idea.Added comment Too many people answer Was this comment helpful? with a no because they disagree with the expressed opinion.

It got mixed reviews mostly due to the fact that critics didn't appreciate its mix of comedy and drama and the abrupt mood shift midway through the film from a light tone to a very dark one.  In fact this shift was entirely intentional and essential to the conception of the film.In the first half LuluAudrey Melanie Griffith in what may be her best performance ever introduces niceguy yuppie Charlie Jeff Daniels also in one of his best roles to the thrills of forbidden adventure from hilariously kinky sex in a roadside motel to running out on a restaurant tab and stealing from a cash register.  This life seems exciting and thrilling. In the second half with the appearance of her exhusband Ray who has just gotten out of jail Ray Liotta much better here than in the psychocop role in the mediocre Unlawful Entry we see the dark and violent side of life on the wrong side of social conventions.One interesting thing about this movie easy to miss when you see it for the first time is that many of the comical episodes from the first half are paralleled by mirrorimage episodes in the second half only in a dark and dramatic key.  For instance the abduction of Charlie by LuluAudrey has a parallel in the very real kidnapping of Audrey by Ray in the second half. Lulu's theft of cash from the liquor store treated as an amusing prank is parallelled by Ray's violent robbery of a store in the second half.  There are other examples of this.All in all a brilliant work.  Highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "This exhilarating comedy thriller about a straightlaced businessman who gets kidnapped seduced and corrupted by a sexy stranger is fastmoving offbeat and quite subversive. It's great fun to see how quickly the guy's latent rebelliousness gets liberated by being exposed to some wild reckless and impulsive behaviour but everything has its price and soon it becomes apparent that his pursuit of freedom is taking him ever deeper into the dark side.Charlie Driggs Jeff Daniels is an uptight yuppie who walks out of a New York diner without paying and out on the street gets challenged about his actions by a young woman called Lulu Melanie Griffith. He's relieved when he realises that she doesn't work at the diner but was simply a customer who saw what he did. He accepts her offer of a lift back to his office but she immediately sets off on a highspeed joyride throws his pager out of the window and drinks at the wheel. She persuades him to share some booze with her en route and then drives to a cheap motel where she handcuffs Charlie to a bed and seduces him.After Charlie contacts his boss to make his excuses for not being at work the couple continue their carefree journey and Lulu sets Charlie up to leave another restaurant without paying before taking him to visit her mother Peaches Dana Preu. Lulu confesses that her real name is Audrey and Charlie plays along when she says that he's her new husband. Audrey's change of name coincides with a remarkable physical transformation as she goes from being a brunette bedecked in lots of colourful jewellery to a blonde who's dressed far more conventionally.All the lying they did when they visited Peaches continues when the couple go to Audrey's high school reunion and share an invented history of their time together with some of Audrey's contemporaries. The whole mood changes dramatically however when Audrey's husband Ray Ray Liotta appears. He's a violent criminal who's recently been released from prison and is clearly not happy when he sees Audrey with Charlie. The events that follow gradually lead from a violent crime spree to numerous other unpredictable developments that becomes increasingly dangerous for everyone involved.Something Wild is an extraordinary and highly unconventional movie with a plot which follows a trajectory that noone could reasonably predict from what happens in the opening scene. Its wonderful combination of comedy romance and violent crime creates situations where the atmosphere changes drastically at various points and the fact that these changes take place so naturally and logically is obviously attributable to the considerable skill of director Jonathan Demme and the excellent performances from Melanie Griffith and Jeff Daniels who reflect so seamlessly the changes that their characters go through. Ray Liotta is also fantastic as Audrey's psychotic husband who's actually even scarier when he's being charming because the sheer strength of his innate rage is always so visible.This movie's refreshing originality and unpredictability combined with its humour terrific music and marvellous characters make it highly enjoyable and truly exceptional.".

On an impulse having lunch alone he skips out on the check just to see what it feels like. Outside a strangely dressed garishly madeup Melanie Griffith who calls herself Lulu catches up with him threatens to expose his crime and more or less kidnaps him.They drive through New Jersey to Pennsylvania with Lulu flirting lying and thieving at every step. Her behavior is confident and outrageous. She handcuffs him to the bed and forces him to lie to his boss over the phone while she ministers to him. She asks him into the bathroom while she's peeing. Daniels begins to enjoy his release a little and they speed along and booze it up on the pastoral highways. When they reach her home town she introduces him to her mother as her husband. Her mother played with a great deal of rural charm by Dana Preu sees through the ruse immediately and flows along with Lulu's fantasy. She also plays a clumsy but sweet minuet by Bach on the living room harpsichord. It gets worse at Lulu's high school reunion. By this time Lulu has changed her grooming and looks like a square young lady and Daniels is now shed his Wall Street gear and is decked out in a loud suit and canary yellow tie. There Daniels runs into someone who works down the hall from him at the office. Gulping with fear stuttering Daniels begins to introduce Lulu with some semblance of respectability but Lulu interrupts  I'm his mistress. The coworker is properly awed because Lulu is nobody's idea of a dog. Lulu goes on We're going to get married because of the baby. The coworker You're going to have his child? Lulu chuckles I THINK it's his. She delivers all her lines in a smoothly casual fashion.It's all been fun and games so far with Daniels being Apollonian and Lulu being Dionysian as Nietzsche might have described them. The moderate rational formal Daniels being corrupted  or liberated  by the ecstatic drunken spirited Lulu. By the time of the high school prom though they have become something of a blend. So it turns out to be what we always suspected. Daniels was a latent Dionysian  but better latent than never. Sorry. Things turn dark when they run into Lulu's old boyfriend Ray Liotta at his most seductively evil.The comedy never really stops as Liotta takes them on a crime spree but we're now in serious territory because Liotta is like a zit about to pop with rage. He punctures things with his sharp metaltipped boots.It's worth seeing if only because it's not simply stupid when it's measured against most of the garbage filling today's movie screens. There's a real sense of spiritedness as Daniels and Lulu zip along in their beatup convertible guzzling recklessly out of the bottle and playing reggae on the radio with Lulu smiling and rhythmically swaying back and forth to the beats even while she sits behind the wheel. It's all a fantasy of course and there is no heavy message involved unless it's lighten up a little and try to avoid old boyfriends.".

I give this film 10 out of 10 and no mistake.Anyone who doesn't realise this is the ne plus ultra of Heimat films  with the exception of the Sissi trilogy another Ernst Marischka Agfacolor bonbon  doesn't know a thing about cinema and less about Viennese Burgtheater history.Die Deutschmeister showcases the most talented actors who ever pried a laugh from the hypercritical Viennese certainly the most discerning judges of acting talent in all of Europe a mouthwatering Who's Who of Austrian theatre and film Susi Nicoletti Gunther Philipp Adrienne Gessner Hans Moser Josef Meinrad Paul Hrbiger not to mention Romy Schneider's film debut alongside mama Magda.This film has not made it to the Englishspeaking world and more's the pity  certainly those in Spain Portugal Italy France South America are not so deprived. It's to the great credit of the translators involved that the pace and hilarity are not compromised in the least the Portuguese and CastillianSpanish versions as special standouts. The Viennese accent and slang does not lend itself to translation partly because of the inherently comedic nature of the accent with it's broad A's and slurred rattattat speech but perhaps that's more a credit of the comedic richness of the film which allows itself to be replicated with a sparkling levity in whatever language.For those who wish a film capsule here you areStanzi Hbner the insouciant bedirndled Salzburger maiden who believes in fortunes foretold by parrots comes to the Kaiserstadt Vienna to work for her auntie Therese. She in turn is the Official Croissant Baker of that aged Biedermeier legend the Emperor Franz Josef a job of importance in this croissantconscious capital. Now there's a mouthful.In one of the twists of fate so adored and duplicated a millionfold by Austrian storytellers she is confused by a Tourette's Syndromed nobleman as a Countess in a Fasching dance and he later enters into matrimony sight unseen with a real Countess who merely had the infinite good fortune of living in the general neighbourhood of Stanzi's aunt.Stanzi then meets a young wouldbe composer soldier in Die Deutschmeister regiment and whilst her own romance is flourishing she engineers her aunt's flirtation with a courtier whose sole duty seems to be Official PickerUpper of the Daily Imperial Croissant. No doubt his title is more grandiose on paper.For those who wish a highlighted critique here it isWatch the light interplay between Susi Nicoletti Adrienne Gessner and Gunther Philipp and then tell us this film isn't worthy of Tracy and Hepburn at their peak. Only when you've acted together more times than they have do you mistake absolute mastery of their craft for anything less than what it is.If you want a frisky gambol in the best tradition of Viennese light comedy this my friends is your film.".

It's to the great credit of the translators involved that the pace and hilarity are not compromised in the least the Portuguese and CastillianSpanish versions as special standouts. The Viennese accent and slang does not lend itself to translation partly because of the inherently comedic nature of the accent with it's broad A's and slurred rattattat speech but perhaps that's more a credit of the comedic richness of the film which allows itself to be replicated with a sparkling levity in whatever language.For those who wish a film capsule here you areStanzi Hbner the insouciant bedirndled Salzburger maiden who believes in fortunes foretold by parrots comes to the Kaiserstadt Vienna to work for her auntie Therese. She in turn is the Official Croissant Baker of that aged Biedermeier legend the Emperor Franz Josef a job of importance in this croissantconscious capital. Now there's a mouthful.In one of the twists of fate so adored and duplicated a millionfold by Austrian storytellers she is confused by a Tourette's Syndromed nobleman as a Countess in a Fasching dance and he later enters into matrimony sight unseen with a real Countess who merely had the infinite good fortune of living in the general neighbourhood of Stanzi's aunt.Stanzi then meets a young wouldbe composer soldier in Die Deutschmeister regiment and whilst her own romance is flourishing she engineers her aunt's flirtation with a courtier whose sole duty seems to be Official PickerUpper of the Daily Imperial Croissant. No doubt his title is more grandiose on paper.For those who wish a highlighted critique here it isWatch the light interplay between Susi Nicoletti Adrienne Gessner and Gunther Philipp and then tell us this film isn't worthy of Tracy and Hepburn at their peak. Only when you've acted together more times than they have do you mistake absolute mastery of their craft for anything less than what it is.If you want a frisky gambol in the best tradition of Viennese light comedy this my friends is your film.";

	schema:reviewBody "Die Deutschmeister or A March for the Emperor is an Austrian Germanlanguage film from 1955 so this one had its 60th anniversary last year. It was directed and written by Ernst Marischka and stars Romy Schneider and these two are mostly known for their collaborations on the famous Sissi films. This one here however has Schneider play another character. But the topics are similar especially the romance aspects. In contrast to Sissi there is also considerable music in here. However the writing was just soso. At easily over 90 minutes it dragged a lot during its runtime and Schneider's acting also wasn't good enough to make up for the flaws in the script. I personally did now know what Deutschmeister were before watching this film and I cared even less after watching the movie. Schneider is of course breathtakingly stunning as usual in her young years but this cannot make up for everything else that is wrong or boring about this film. It is a bit more pompous than most other Germanlanguage films from the 1950s but in terms of plot and story it does not bring anything else. It just wasn't as very good decade for film in Germany. This film tries to make a difference but ends up very forgettable. Not recommended.".

The passion and need for these two lonely people that lets them open doors to their inner selves and allow another in BEFORE thinking of the consequences there are ALWAYS consequences in film and life for opening those doors. Is it believable that they would win the fight with the street thugs? No. Is it believable that the adrenaline rush the release of the flight impulse and fear the closeness found in 'defeating a common enemy' could possibly lead to the intensity of sexual closeness and climax in a semisecluded spot under falling water at that? Yes. Are the other scenes believable? It's entertainment not a psychology class... They are conceivable certainly. Ever been really mad at your partner and that anger leads to words then breaking dishes then apologies then hugging then closeness then sex? How about anger leading directly to sex? It can happen and it does. It is not so much a rape as it is a purging of desire. The scene with Liz blindfolded and the whore coming in to the room  you share the tenseness Liz feels.

He wants HER to know that he knows it will.This movie is a glimpse of what manipulators people are. The efforts made to manipulate another person into 'making them want what you want'. So much so that it becomes their desire not yours. So much so that the desire is to see if you can manipulate the other becomes more consuming than the original goal.

I found this film to be intelligent and stylishly done and yes very erotic.

	schema:headline " A Film About the Destructiveness of Sex Obsession";
	schema:reviewBody "I think most people don't understand this movie. This is not a love story at least not in the conventional sense. 9 12 weeks is about sexual desire and intimate sensuality run amok and becoming the monopolizing forces in a relationship and the ultimate demise of that relationship as a result. Certainly the physical pleasures and sensuality of sex are aspects that make a relationship fulfilling and gratifying but they are not the only facets. A relationship purely based on sexual desire is doomed to failure. At first it seems like a game but later on the intensity is too much for the relationship to withstand largely because if love and caring are sacrificed for the sex it will die.You almost couldn't find more suitable casting than Mickey Roarke and Kim Bassinger. Roarke plays John a sexuallydriven finance executive who is not satisfied with winning over the woman he wants. He craves continual heightened sexual excitement from his lady friend. And he uses subtle coercion to achieve his goals. For Elizabeth played by Bassinger John is the ideal lover. He makes her breakfast buys her clothes brushes her hair. He takes care of her in an interesting role reversal. But nothing is free. In return John wants Elizabeth to be in his complete control and engage in sensuous sex games. And each game is more intense than the last.At first the games seem innocent enough. He likes to blindfold her and play a touchyfeely game in which he introduces objects that she feels andor tastes. But then the requests become more intense. He wants her to enact a striptease to dress in a certain way without her consent and to receive a spanking for being a nosey parker. They have sex in the oddest of places sometimes engaging in intimate contact in public. At first Elizabeth enjoys the attention and the excitement until she begins to lose the sense of herself as the relationship intensifies. And John eventually goes too far. At one poignant moment in the film Elizabeth speaks with an artistrecluse. Because her job is at an art gallery she helps coordinate artists for exhibitions. When she finds him in a rural area she asks him if he remembered that his exhibition is coming up. He replies that when he is hungry he remembers to eat and when he is tired he remembers to sleep. She has lost the simpler pleasures of life and this old man reminds her of that. Late in the film there is an interesting scene where Elizabeth's former boyfriend comes to the place she worksnot to see her but he is now dating one of her coworkers. He's a plain man who does not have nearly the sexual allure of Roarke. But he seems kind and honest. Liz watches her coworker and her former boyfriend leave and there is an expression on her face that speaks volumes maybe she misjudged him afterall. For a moment the two stare at each other from a distance and you get the feeling that she was the one who left him. He is not the Mr Exciting that John is but maybe he has other qualities that John could never have.This is quite a stunning film certainly not for all tastes and some of the steamy sex scenes could be misinterpreted as being only for pornographic sake. What saves it are the incredible and absolutely believable performances by the two leads Roarke and Bassinger which strangely complement one another. Roarke plays his character right on the money always enigmatic never raising his voice but always mysterious. His character is always just outside of reach. He constantly smiles even when he is noticeable disappointed. Basinger is a perfect complement as one of the few actresses left who can be vulnerable and elicit a willingness to be under control that you don't see in many female performances anymore. Despite what may appear to be pornography there is a point to the film I think and that is that constant sexual control and nurturing relationships mix like oil and water. In the end you wonder if it was all a game.".

The characters find each other and they enjoy each other in a way that many people cannot accept and therein lies the reality the truth of this film as well as the reason that it is consistently overlooked. For an established actress like Kim Basinger to accept this role and play it as naturally as she did speaks to her talent as well at to her willingness to explore alternate romantic ideas on film. Mickey Rouke has always been a maverick force in film. Look at him in Diner and you will see what I mean by that.

Kim Basinger never looked more beautiful and Rourke looked great too. I disagree that there was no character development. I think there were depths to both characters that didn't come out until the end of the movie which I found very poignant. Yes I think it was more about power than sex and when the moment of truth came for the balance of power to shift  as the Rourke character had planned for it to do  he had scared off his true love. Sad and a true sequel could have been fun.I give it 810 and plan to add it to my video collection ASAP.".

Also many may find the film a bit overstated for the way it tries to prove it messages of love and feeling. Still this is a film that is fun and very enjoyable to watch as it proves just how complex and tense that love making can be really this film showcased it as a dangerous and mysterious game of obsession.Set in New York City with the hustle and rush of big city life you see ElizabethKim Basinger a young single and attractive woman who works at an art gallery showcase. Then one day while strolling the city by chance and fate she meets a handsome and strange man his name is JohnMickey Rourke. John is the perfect man who has a successful job as a wall street broker he dresses nice has a nice place. Yet the big thing missing is love. He's just so emotionally empty that it hurts inside.When the relationship progresses the love making leads to extremes as their ways of pleasure are strange. The scenes where food were used as support were interesting! John had clearly showed a side of being a risk taker and that is seen as even being more evident when his erotic love making ways with Elizabeth push her limits and boundaries. You name it from blindfolds to whip creme to another woman for hot turn ons for John! This film really proved just how fun love making can be true it pushed the limits but it showed just how far someone will go like the John character who was so emotionally and physically empty for so long. Yet in the end as with most cases the passion wears off as it couldn't last proving that love hurts and it must be a special kind for it to last. Overall good film that may be a little to dated still it's a nice treat for it's take of pushing love making to new erotic and obsessive heights. As it proved love can be so complex and which passion feeds from one's emotions. And the on screen chemistry between Basinger and Rourke made it a watch.".

I guess one could say this is kind of a Last Tango in Paris of my generation maybe not as deep and bleak but Lynn packaged this film like one long music video or long commercial there is so much eye candy shots and that is just to get your attention so he can draw into this relationship that develops slow into a kind of dark and sad area. The first time John and Liz meet each other John takes her back to a boat house and while there he kind of gives a her subtle glimpse of his sadistic nature and all the other scenes that follow are all like a building blocks of John's dark character who according to Liz She can't figure what he is about.There is a scene where John takes Liz to buy her the outfit that he likes and while paying the cashier Liz asks John don't want to know what I think about it?and John smiles and says No. At his apartment he has her crawl to pick up the money because it pleases him and doesn't care what Liz feels about it and yet Liz continues to let him push her into doing it. Each time she gives into his demands he goes further to manipulate her into something that he likes and that last request in the hotel room with the Hooker was the breaking point for Liz where she runs into a porn store and kisses a complete stranger to get a kind of even with John and yet deep in turmoil on the inside of what is happening to her.I think to me the last scene its still the very best part of this whole film when Liz gets out of bed while John still sleeping and she is in tears. She begins to pack up her stuff and when John wakes up he tries to again in his subtle and manipulative way to stop her. He says he has never felt like the way he feels with her and some how he calls his feelings Love. I think what I like the best is what Liz says we both knew it will be over if one of us said stop but you wouldn't say it and I waited too long she has had enough as much as she is in love I guess there is a part of her that can still find reason and see the damage this relationship can do to her I don't think the audience didn't expect this to happen or how it will end so fast in just 9 12 weeks for most of us takes so much longer to realize how unhealthy a relationship is because we are too busy having fun and focusing on sex as love this is where this film truly becomes of a substance and takes a huge turn by Liz ending it not John this time she took control and left John hoping she will return as all others did when he counted to 50 this is how self absorbed his character was. When Liz leaves the apartment while walking and crying in the street there is one last shot of her turning back one more time maybe hoping John had followed her and then she turns because its over this part still holds up today as it did 18 years ago when I first saw it and I still get the same feeling.This film really should have been longer and from what I read here it was originally about 3 hours and I like others would Mr. Lynn does someday release it as a director's cut. I never saw the sequel to this film Another 9 12 weeks which I hear was a disaster. Its sad really because this could have been like Before Sunrise and Before Sunset sequels although Mickey Rourke may not as appealing or as popular he once was back in the 80's after his acting career took a dive to his boxing career but I still think he is a great actor and I personally would like to see another sequel with both Bassinger and Rourke to this dark romantic masterpiece...you never know it may still happen?".

	schema:headline " A fascinating study of sex and how it affects some people";
	schema:reviewBody "May contain some spoilersWhat I find incredibly ironic about our society  North American that is  is how hypocritical we are when it comes to sex.  I mean let's face it many people over the age of 18 have had it at least once and many people are consumed by it.  And as long as it is consentual protected sex and intentions are never misleading then what is wrong with sex even if it is with someone that you are not in love with.  Sex can be a powerful thing. Because if you think about all the feelings that you can experience during the act they really range perhaps more than any single act that you can think of. Everything from pure lust to passionate love can be felt at one time or another during sex.  And I find it funny that certain institutions or groups try to deny or at least restrict people from fulfilling one of the most basic needs they have as an animal.  Nine 12 Weeks explores the power of sex.  It examines it and doesn't shy away from what it wants to say. And for a film that is almost 14 years old I have to applaud it for pushing the envelope of what is acceptable and what is loathed.Kim Basinger is a successful but lonely woman living in New York City. She meets a stranger who buys her an expensive item that she could never afford. But he buys it because he can.  This starts the intrigue between the two. He is the tall dark mysterious man that doesn't really reveal much of himself.  He is obviously incredibly wealthy but it is not really revealed what it is that he does.  And that feeling of subserviance is paralleled when the blindfold scene is presented to us later in the film.  He controls his life by controlling others.  He has his world under his control and that includes his sexuality towards her.Some say that this film doesn't really have a point or that it has no plot but to show a lot of soft core sex scenes.  But look at it a little more carefully and you will see that it does have much to say.  It just has to say it about sex and many people can't handle that.  Sex is topic that is taboo.  It is something that shuold stay in Pandora's box buried in some ancient Egyptian catacomb never to be unleashed on mankind.  But Adrienne Lynne is a bit of a renegade that or he grew up in Europe where sex is like eating.  They are both necessary to live.This film also has a perfect mood setting soundtrack.  Songs like Slave to Love and Eurasian Eyes are just as important to the film as the lighting and the set design.  Then there is Joe Cocker's famous  You Can Leave Your Hat On melody that is the perfect song for Basinger's strip tease.  These songs heighten the mood and make you feel a part of the world that you are voyeuristically watching.I'm not going to comment on the plot and the acting and the direction or tell you what this film is about.  It is a film about a relationship that is doomed because of it's sexuality that is all you need to know.  Judge for yourself how good or how bad it is.  I personally liked this film very much and I do recommend it.  It has a lot to show and a lot to say about our psyche when it comes to doing it.  But don't take my word make up your own mind.".

	schema:headline " Kim Basinger makes this worth seeing";
	schema:reviewBody "What one realizes while watching this is how limited and ultimately unsatisfactory is a relationship based purely on sex.I imagine that the familiar dominancesubmissive psychology at the heart of this visually stunning movieand it really is beautifully shotcomes from the novel by Elizabeth MacNeil. I say that not having read the novel because the seduction of Manhattan art dealer Elizabeth Kim Basinger by the smooth and supremely confident financier John Mickey Rourke is so very well done with the expensive presents the welltimed flower deliveries little endearments etc. that it amounts to a woman's fantasy. The partial debasement of Elizabeth and her eventual triumph over her darker instincts and her realization that there is a difference between love and submission is also something that one might expect to find in a woman's pointofview novel.However when we get to the actual sexuality and how it is acted out it is unclear who dreamed up the scenes MacNeil or director Adrian Lyne or the scriptwriters. I say this because the scenes were so predictable and so ordinary and when not ordinary and predictable were bordering on the just plain dumb. Making love in the rain at the top of a tall building inside the clock tower blindfolding the woman making her crawl feeding her strawberries etc. bring nothing new to eroticism. And the scene requiring some imaginationbaiting the gay basherswas not realistically done. Why directors insist on allowing a man holding onto the hand of woman to outrun the men chasing them never ceases to amaze me. And then to have Elizabeth and John stop in the middle of the street to allow the bashers they have outrun to catch up was just plain stupid not to mention the phony fight that followed.Not only were the sexual scenes predictable but clearly Lyne was in harness and I am glad of that since he stops well short of what might happen if this sort of theme were fully played out.Putting all that aside what makes this movie worth seeing is Kim Basinger. She is absolutely stunning and it is clear that Lyne and his camera adored her. More than that Basinger does a fine job of acting in a demanding role.I was impressed. Before seeing this film I thought she was a rather ordinary actress but her ability to combine grownup New York chic with littlegirl vulnerability and to make absolutely clear the psychological dilemma her character's heart faced really held the movie together.Lyne's insistence on whispered dialogue difficult to hear was consistent with the theme of the movie but not kind to these ears. But that was okay because much of the dialogue was secondary to the visual exploration of the woman's sexuality. The peekaboo and off center and shadowed shots of Basinger's face and her silhouette and the studied smile from Rourke combined with the stark black and whites of their clothes and the furnishings served to highlight and emphasis the flesh tones of Basinger's skin while lending an appropriate artistic and fashionable atmosphere to the movie which after all has an art dealer at its center. The many scenes that were began and suggested and then cut away from allowed a richer texture of experience for the viewer than would have been possible had the scenes been played out. And that was doubly good because again it is the visuals that make this movie worth seeing not the originality of the story and its development.To those viewers who thought that this was some sort of high class pornography I can only say you missed the point entirely and indeed you may be projecting your own sorry mentality. For those others who were not shall we say sufficiently stimulated I can point you to a graphic novel with a similar theme written by a man entitled The Story of O which will NOT be coming to a theater near you anytime soon.See this for Kim Basinger whose sensitive and robust beauty dominated the screen.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!".

Probably this is not a movie made for the American audience which many times react in a bad way when a movie push a little bit too much the envelope. This movies was a very big hit in Europe when first came out. It was the most talk about movie of the year because of his extremely unique and modern approach to sexuality in a film. I was very young when this movie came out but i still remember the big fuss about it. The director is one of the best director he challenged himself constantly his movies are never boring or dull and he like to take chances which many directors are very afraid to do it. Nine and 12 weeks is a very interesting movie to watch because it is about what is going on between this 2 people in an emotional level. Which can be pretty scary for the intensity of that. It is not about sex it goes beyond that. It is a very innovative movie that it would always be remembered for changing the rules about making movies that are considered erotic. Too bad that not everybody is Adrian Lyne and the majority of the films of this genre are horribly bad.".

I can't see anyone else playing either role. In this day and age of accepted nudity 9 12 Weeks leaves enough to the imagination to make this movie highlyerotic by most standards. It leaves the imagination wide open to explore our own innerworkings and desires. Everyone of legal age should watch this movie more than once. I've watched it at least a dozen times since 1992 and have gotten something 'different' out of it each time. Everyone will get something different from this movie but it must be watched with an open mind. The movie had to end the way it did or it wouldn't have made sense otherwise. It's incredibly thoughtprovoking and left me with various emotions throughout every scene. For anyone who hasn't seen it it's worth every highlycharged minute.".

In sync to the title the relationship is not long lasting but the experience was unforgettable and utterly fulfilling. John has been smitten with Elizabeth the moment he has set his eyes on her while his flawless charisma is hard for Elizabeth to resist. As a no brainer she naturally falls in love with John and while his behavior becomes more domineering and controlling his seductive mannerisms are just so unbearable for her to let go. He continually pampers her with gifts even though that barely phases her romantically. It appears that what gets her juices flowing is his manipulative charm and his physical good looks. The most intimate moments came from a scene where Elizabeth is blindfolded in the kitchen and John starts rubbing her with ice cubes and feeds her while her eyes are blocked and they have sex in places we would have never imagined like a back alley or at a clock tower. Sure the eroticism is quite frequent the scenes are overly done in terms of vulgarity as one might anticipate. It all comes down on its audience to draw their own interpretations. The actions of John is quite unpredictable as you just anxiously await to see if his raw emotions change this movies will try keep you at the edge of your seat. But throughout the movie John succeeds to keep his calmness in tact even when he was controlling her which makes this man a hostile individual with a subtle demeanor. In the case of Elizabeth her vulnerable desire is just to be loved no matter how much of a jerk John can be. And sure she didn't like the games he played she still went along and enjoyed what was given to her. The interaction of Basinger and Rourke's characters is so engaging you will want to applaud them one their names appear when the final credit roll.".

There is an edge of danger in everything that John does stopping the ferris wheel at its highest point feeding the blindfolded Liz a chilli pepper and the nervous insecure Liz has to learn to embrace the risks in order to augment the thrills.That's the theory.  What we get is Basploitation with Kim Basinger having her nipples and bikini line rubbed with ice cubes.  Lacking the imagination to treat its subject seriously the flim shows us scene after scene of Mickey Rourke shovelling food into Basinger's mouth.  Rourke's character is meant to be mysterious and alluring but he is mostly just plain irritating.  Basinger's Liz is supposedly being titillated but the titillation is aimed at the viewer not the girl molasses poured on a thigh LOOKS sexy but actually FEELS yucky.

Molly is a funnyandsassybutvulnerablejewishNewYorker who bashes the trunks of taxis which displease her.  The flower delivery boy bops to the rhythm of his walkman because this is New York and he's a crazy dude.  The more the film strives after image the more it descends into cliche.  This isn't New York it's a stereotype of New York concocted by West Coast filmmakers.Details which are intended to persuade us that this affair is a wild romantic fling simply don't work for the simple reason that they are grindingly mundane throwing Liz's hat into the air a 'quickie' in the clock tower.  Rourke lacks the gravitas of a Don Juan.  He is supposed to be a wonderful cook but all we ever see him doing is cracking raw eggs.Aspects of the film which tax our credulity include the fight with the street thugs which John and Liz win so easily the copulation under a downspout of freezing New York rainwater and the legspreading game on the department store bed.Is it fair that pretty blonde actresses are expected to get their kit off in this way?  Well one imagines that there are plenty more pretty blonde actresses in work than plain ones and the pretty ones don't seem to be complaining.  Basinger may rail against it all now but she took the chance of stardom when it came her way.  In one scene Liz crawls reluctantly across the floor picking up money.  Maybe that is a metaphor.".

Sure Jon was very aggressive sexually with Elizabeth and many seem to understand this as being crude or offensive. Instead Jon strikes me as being more honest than slimy. While other men in Jon's position a wealthy commodities broker would try to use his position to win over Elizabeth Jon just straightforward lets her know that he wants her. I also don't think Jon merely wants Elizabeth for sex. Clearly he enjoys her company for more than just that in fact he shares a great deal of his world with her. I think what is offensive about Rourke's character is that Jon is so unapologetically male. First Jon has a highpowered job which at the time was extremely risky and lucrative. Yeah while Jon lives in a fancy apartment and buys Elizabeth nice things it is clear that he is not a trustfund baby but a guy who worked his way to the top with determination and balls.That helps explain the most difficult scene in the movie. Elizabeth has been snooping through his stuff and Jon returns enraged and semirapes Elizabeth. Earlier that evening Jon had promised to take care of Elizabeth and provide for her every need which is quite a commitment and he leaves her alone for a short time but finds that he already cannot really trust her. His response to her actions is bizarre first he wants to spank her then he forcefully makes love to her. Is it abusive? Yes probably. What the hell does it mean? Well here you have a guy who is in an extremely competitive position where he has scrapped his way to the top. In his position weakness and vulnerability get you decimated in your job and most women you meet probably only want you for your money. Jon takes a chance with a girl he meets randomly who he seems to have a real connection with and almost from the getgo she compromises his trust. He forces himself on her because he is desperate to have connection with somebody who will be a refuge for him yet from his perspective he already cannot trust her. The rest of the movie all of the sexual escapades including the sex scene at the end with the prostitute is Jon trying to determine how much he should really give himself to Elizabeth. The scene where Elizabeth shows up at his work is indicative of this. Clearly he is not happy at first that she showed up there. Judging from the size of his office this guy is at the pinnacle of success and letting somebody he isn't sure he can trust into that world is very risky for him. Not only does it reveal himself to her but it reveals to the other people around him that he is vulnerable. For men of power in that kind of position vulnerability can destroy their careers.The prostitute scene at the end wasn't just some other kinky escapade. I think it was a final test for Jon so that he would know whether Elizabeth was really committed to him or not or if she was only viewing their relationship as a sexual game. To him it was the only way to know how exclusively she cared about him. When she reacted by making out with the random guy in the porn theater Jon finally understood that she really did care about him. By that point however he had destroyed any trust she had in him.Basinger's character Elizabeth in contrast was far less complicated. She enjoys her friends has a good relationship with her parents and even has a decent relationship with her exhusband. If you contrast the type of jobs the two have in the movie it is easy to see the dramatic differences in their lives. Elizabeth casually jokes with her boss and coworkers and the biggest pressure in her life is whether an artist will show up at a show. This movie was about all of the things that sex communicates and ultimately Rourke brilliantly pulls off a complicated character who is unabashedly male and dying to be vulnerable at the same time.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is not a feature film.  For a start it is not feature length also it is not shot on film.  More importantly it does not have what feature films have these days star actors special effects exotic locations explosions.  Instead seeing B.W.P. is seeing something else that a cinema can be a place where people can share an intimate experience created by a few people on a tight budget.  I would be glad of its success if only for that reason.The first section of the film appears at first to be amateurish and slow. In fact it is very deft and very efficient at what it does.  It tells the audience everything it needs to know about the characters and situation and nothing more.  Also it gets the audience into the habit of viewing the film's format alternating between black and white very grainy and poorly focussed film and the washed out colours of shaky pixilated video.  The film makers managed to set up a rationale for why the film is so cheaply made.  Three people hike into the woods for a few days to shoot a documentary with borrowed equipment and are in the habit of videoing everything for the hell of it.   They cannot carry tripods steadicams dollies large lighting rigs or the like so everything we see is lit either by raw daylight or by a single light fixed to the camera which illuminates just what is within a few feet of the lens.  The film creates its own excuse to be cheap.  This is intelligent.The acting and script are both excellent.  The wellcast actors are presumably playing prettymuch themselves and are convincingly naturalistic and neither too likeable or too dislikeable.  The slow route into hysteria is well documented.  Rather than simply having a character say We're lost! we see many scenes which show the trio getting more and more hopelessly lost and more annoyed with each other for this.  By the time they are thoroughly lost the audience shares the despair.My friend and I after seeing it both felt a little sick.  I put this down to my having been tense for a hour he put it down more to motion sickness. The jerky badlyframed camerawork is hard on the eye and stomach but I applaud the director for its uncompromising use.  Similarly no compromise is made with the dialogue.  Some of it is very quiet and must be listened for some is technical jargon which is left realisticly unexplained.One of the great strengths and weaknesses of the film is the editing.  It is good in that it does much to heighten the tension with many key moments lasting just a little too long for comfort.  Each time the characters find something nasty the viewer is made to want the editor to cut soon to the next scene and the fact that he doesn't adds to the sense of being trapped as the characters are.  The problem with this though is that one is left wondering about the motives of the fictional editor.  In truth of course the film is edited to create these effects and to entertain but the film's rationale is that these are the rushes of a documentary put together posthumously by someone other than the film's original creator.  Why then would an editor piecing together such footage edit for dramatic effect rather than for clarity?  Why would he keep cutting back and forth from the video footage to the film footage when neither shows any more information than the other?The film is stark.  After one simple caption at the start all that follows is the rushes.  I wonder if the film might not have been improved with an introductory section which documented how the rushes were found and edited. A programme was made for television which did this.  Perhaps a portion of this might have been added to the film making it more complete and more believable and proper feature length.While I applaud the fact that young original filmmakers have managed to create a mainstream hit out of a simple idea wellhandled.  I dread the possible avalanche of inferior copies which may come.Most horror films these days are created not for the audience but for the makers.  The departments of special effects makeup modelmaking animation and so forth all try hard to show potential future employers what they can do.  The result is that nothing is left for the audience to do since everything can be seen and heard and the viewer's imagination can be switched off.  Today it is possible to see pigs fly on the screen and so filmmakers show off and show us a formation of Tamworths which is something which will look impressive in the trailer.  To show us less is to make our minds fill in the gaps.  This way we create our own terrors perfectly fitted to ourselves.  The ghastly face I see in my head is the ghastly head which I find scary.  The ghastly face I am shown may be one I can cope with quite easily.  If I see a believable character screaming in hysterical fear at something I cannot see my own brain creates demons for my night's dreams demons far more mighty than anything CGI graphics or a latex mask could portray.This film will stay in your thoughts for some while.".

First I heard this movie was the scariest movie since THE EXORCIST then I heard it was the worst movie of the year. When people thought it might be real they loved it. Then when everyone found out it was fake I heard all sorts of bad things about it.THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is about three young filmmakers Heather Donahue Michael Williams and Josh Leonard actors with same names as their characters go out into the woods of Burkittesville Maryland to do a documentary on the mythical Blair Witch. They are never found but a year later their footage is discovered and it seems to indicate that there really was a witch and it was stalking these three filmmakers.I did not find THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT especially scary although it was rather spooky. I did think it was good with an excellent and very original plot. The acting in this movie by the three young kids was very good especially if the rumors about how they improvised most of it were true. The character development was well done and you will often find yourself waiting for daylight along with the characters.Was this movie overhyped? A little but I think if it wasn't that it wouldn't have been as successful since the actors writers and directors are relatively unknown. They did a very good job and I hope to see more works from them in the near future.Sure some of the realism could've been better. Even I knew that they should've followed the stream out of the woods instead of going deeper into the forest. And if this was happening to me I doubt I'd pick up the video camera and tape it all instead of running like hell. But it still worked. I think the scariest part is how you don't see as much as you hear because often the sound is 10 times worse than the thing making the sound.This movie isn't too scary but if you watch it in the middle of the night with all your lights off and alone it will successfully freak you out. It's worth a rent or a buy judge for yourself.".

If you expect too much you may be let down take note for any Kubrick film. I watched the entire film without interruption and came out with a great feeling. The Blair Witch Project is one darn good movie.Many critics and moviegoers complained about the film for its length its amateurish photographyediting and its lack of adequate acting. I feel these things MADE THE MOVIE. First the film has to be at most ninety minutes long any more and it would be too long and boring. Second the amateur video take gives the audience the feel that they are actually in the woods listening to the rippling water of the creek snapping branches under their boots and hearing things go bump in the night. I greatly admire the use of two video cameras one blackandwhite the other color to denote which character is shooting the film. Lastly the incessant screaming of whiny Heather the constant complaining of averagejoe Mike and the DudleyDoRightness of Josh make for great acting. Yes these are regular people and upandcoming actors from your local community theater but YOU KNOW THEM. You've met people like them.The biggest complaint however comes from the film's supposed lack of scary moments. This film reminds me of the classic horror film The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and though not as gory and as shocking as that film The Blair Witch Project shows just enough fright in the group's search for a way out of the woods stalked by people andor things they may never understand. In the older film the long interval between opening credits and first gory act of violence is about thirty minutes long it is even longer here but the suspensefright just as in the older film begins right from the opening credits you just don't see it until the film's over. These are three people out to make a documentary in the woods with handheld camcordersthese are REAL PEOPLE. And GREAT ACTORS. Heather whines a lot and screams and reminds you of the girl you hate so much you fall in love with her. Her screams sound real her cries are genuine and she is DEEPLY DEEPLY sorry for bringing the others into the woods in order to film her documentary.I really dig the beginning. It seems so real to me I may delve into my old home movies for nostalgia. Heather and Josh pick up Mike then go to the store for supplies. This opening sequence really packs a punch. These are three Generation Xers out for a camping trip. We all know what happens to them but we're glued to the screen intent to know what actually happens.The interviews give us some detail into the Blair Witch legend but most of the audience is too busy thinking about the actual trek into the woods that they don't listen. This is wrong. Listening is good. The interviews which also sound real and not rehearsed in any way are like movie reviews the critics tell you what they saw but mostly they don't want to ruin it for you...unless they hated it.And that's what I'll do. I won't ruin it for you. 810.".

	schema:reviewBody "Like most movies whether or not someone likes TBWP will usually depend on what they're looking for.  Many people enjoy horror movies because of the special effects gore shocks and in some cases the high production value.  Since TBWP came from a small independent film company that cost less than a hundred grand to make can a moviegoer really expect all that and have a good time?  I honestly don't think so.Myrick and Sanchez had a terrific idea for a film make a frightening mock documentary that was supposed to look like it was done by some amateur college students.  Some people seem to be under the impression that the movie was about the witch when what it really was about the mental and emotional breakdown of the three film students.  I feel that once viewers could accept the low production values and the improvised script only then could they deal with Heather Josh and Mike.  Until they do that the film would never work for them.I just put myself in their position  I'm lost in the woods I'm tired I'm hungry and I've got the added stress of returning borrowed equipment.  The weather is getting colder it rains just enough to make life miserable and something is waking me up each and every night.  Now I'm exhausted grouchy scared and I having troubles thinking clearly.People might have hated Heather because they she was bitchy and annoying but all three of them had their moments good and bad. Many people might have also hated the fact that not everything was explained to them and that they never got to see the Blair Witch.  Many other people may have resented Artisan Entertainment's marketing campaign although they can't deny just how effective it was.  All the filmmakers and actors asked was that filmgoers understand the spirit that was intended without it they knew the film couldn't work for anybody.As you might already tell I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  What Haxan Films managed to do with what they had is not only revolutionary but is also inspirational to independent filmmakers everywhere.  I found the backstory interesting the plotline well thought out and the characters extremely developed considering the lack of structure and guidelines within the film. If you do decide to see this film I think you'll enjoy it if you see it for what it simply is nothing more it might even scare the hell out of you!".

The less you know about this creepy little chiller the better.Filmed on video and 16mm black  white this film is exactly what the horror genre needs in a time reminiscent of the early 1980s slasher onslaught. The Blair Witch Project has no knife wielding maniacs no DNA altered monsters and no real bloodshed onscreen. We see what the three film makers see as they make their way through the deep dank woods in search of a legendary witch. There are times when there is nothing but a black screen and all we can do is listen to their scared voices and the unexplained noises going on around them. The true horror behind this film is the unknown and those dark places where you know something is lurking.If you are a seasoned veteran of the horror cinema The Blair Witch Project may be less frightening than for someone who has not seen many scary movies. You will have to respect it's originality and it's manipulation of our deepest fears. At times the film really makes you feel the sense of dread the film makers are experiencing. One thing I did notice about the audience in the theater is that everyone was very quiet. Except for an occasional gasp the moviegoers were absorbed in this film. That's unusual for a modern horror movie. Most are full of fake scare tactics and multiple twist endings that keep the audience shouting and screaming at the screen. One thing for sure you can expect many imitations of The Blair Witch Project in the future. Isn't that how it usually goes?".

I've waited for most of the hype to die down to even add my comments for this movie to IMDB and here they areThis is really a movie that has polarized a lot of people. Many love it and consider it the best thing since sliced bread and plenty more absolutely hate it and call it tripe drivel awful wretched the worst ever etc. NOTE as far as I'm concerned the opinions of anyone calling any movie the best or even more especially the worst movie ever are to be immediately disregarded. Highly innovative in its way it spawned many parodies and an interesting but inferior sortof sequel. In the summer of Star Wars Episode 1 this was the movie that originated several cultural symbols.I saw this movie shortly after it opened in wide release. Sitting in a theater surrounded by my friends with popcorn in my lap and watching Mike and Heather run around some creepy old house I felt for the first and last time in my adult life real creeping fear when I myself was not in danger.Many have complained about the shakycam the cussing how nothing 'really happens' and that it's not scary. By and large the camera is not that shaky at least to the point where you can't understand why they're tromping through the woods and they're scared half to death. I must not get queasy very easily as I had no problem with it. As for the cussing the lines were adlibbed the actors are collegeage and all three sound exactly like every American college student I've ever known. So maybe people have a problem with young peoples' language but what else is new? That's not a flaw of the movie it's realism and part of why so many more young people found TBWP scary.I think at least some of the dissention in opinions is caused by generational and cultural differences. My mother's friends told me it wasn't scary but that 'Psycho' terrified them. 'Psycho' while interesting and a classic is not the least bit scary to me. 'The Excorcist' has only a couple scenes that I find frightening but my mom breaks out in goosebumps at the mere mention of it. The scariest thing I ever saw until I watched this movie was a reel in a collection of horror shorts a woman walks into her house carrying groceries drops her keys down her heating vent bends down to try to get them and something grabs her scarf. She struggles but within a minute or two she's drug down and strangled. The scarf goes slack the woman is lying dead on her floor and that's it.TBWP is about what you can't see about how your fear of the unknown is so much worse than what the unknown could probably ever be. The characters were not even necessarily likable but they were familiar Heather is the girl I sit next to in film class who thinks she has all the answers. Their mundane existence captured in the beginning of the film roots them in reality. What happens to them is terrifying because they are so every day so interchangable with millions of other college kids. And finally you never know whether the Witch exists or not. Everything that happens can be explained away by coincidence pranksters bats hunger exhaustion and imaginations run wild with fear or you can choose not to explain them away.Young Americans are not scared of much school shootings can roll off us like water the evil human beings inflict on each other is runofthemill 6 o'clock news we are raised in a culture that claims to worship a vengeful elitist god while almost everyone is hypocritical and uses the power of spirituality as a way to abuse others. We are in information overload from birth. What we fear is not knowing. And in the Black Hills Woods of Maryland just beyond the flashlight's reach something is making strange and terrible noises but we don't know what it is.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've seen worse movies but not many.  Yes I like horror films.  Yes I can distinguish cheap sensationalistic splatterhorror from from the more chilling showlessandfrightenmore variety and I prefer the latter to the former.I still hated Blair Witch.

	schema:reviewBody "CONTAINS SPOILERS In Berkeley The Blair Witch Project generated a lot of a certain type of buzz that will often make me wary and I avoided seeing it during its first run suspecting that I'd feel the rip of an eightdollar ticket. After having screened a VHS copy acquired at Yard Sale Videos I still feel that way a little but not because I didn't like it. Seeing it in a theater would have precluded being able to really watch a film like this the way I prefer to do.I had to stretch a bit to get past some aspects of the film's setup. The selffilmed documentary approach can't quite carry the movie's weight through its entire length. Some sequences could not have been filmed by any of the protagonists as was the implication yet there they were. No one among the three film makers' could have managed the presence of mind in the midst deep panic to have filmed Heather running screaming through the dark woods. It was all too far out of preestablished character although the image is certainly indelible. But even a Dodge Dart with a brown door will get you there if it keeps running and once past my initial hesitations I was forced to admit that The Blair Witch Project is.very effective.There are moments when Blair Witch has the dankness of Silence of The Lambs and the raw twilit scariness of the opening few minutes of Night of the Living Dead in my opinion one of the great horror sequences. I became a true believer at the point where Josh and Mike began to realize that something was very wrong in the crackling Burkittsville woods that they really had to get out and were ramping up to full freak while Heather simply refused to stop filming although there was really nothing to film. This sequence nailed perfectly the deep frustration one can feel under the sway of a relentless knowitall especially when said person is female and thereby largely immune to the more primordial forms of conversation reserved for males. Josh and Mike aggravated and frightened as they were still could not abandon Heather who had become more of a liability at that point than an asset. Both had begun to succumb to the stress of walking the razor edge between being scared squatless and being unable to admit it.The Blair Witch Project has an unassuming almost sneaky way of getting to you. First off the main characters are not at all likeable which in itself is fatiguing. Josh and Mike are types that might be found at loose ends on any Saturday night marooned in a mall or minimart parking lot. Heather is an almostcute soontobeoverweight classic candidate for domestic violence at the hands of a future husband or boyfriend equipped with no sense of humor or of the ironic. A few minutes with them and you are more than ready to burn out from slogging the monotonous autumn woods where night freed from the shackles of Daylight Savings Time comes too soon and remains too long. When the exhausted trio takes to its sleeping bags you're right with them. Then you're suddenly wide awake for all the wrong reasons. The sound of fracturing wood out past a wall of darkness on which strong flashlight beams pile up like pizza dough are not just twigs being snapped. They're branches big ones. But this conclusion is never verbalized by any of the trio. One of the three refers to the sound as footsteps' but only if the feet are size72 American. It's left up to us to fully grasp the implications.The three principal actors are essentially playing themselves and all perfectly manifest the giddy hubris reserved for those who may be able to come fifteen times a day but possess just enough knowledge and experience to be dangerous. But playing one's self may be harder than it looks and they do so with conviction most notably the toughminded endlessly irritating Heather. Her character may be packing the only real cojones in the bunch and when she finally begins to unglue near the end you know the doodoo has gotten very deep. It's not mere postadolescent cheeseburgercraving discomfort any longer. That trifle has been left far behind somewhere back under the decaying leaves. Heather's runnynosed video selfportrait made upon realizing that she and her companions are in far far over their heads is truly poignant. We may enjoy seeing vain clueless teens get theirs in slasher movies but the Blair Witch trio three somewhat looselywrapped goofballs trying to pull off a filmmaking project are really not clueless in the classic sense nor are they stupid. They've just intrepidly placed themselves in a very wrong place for which there may be no possible right time.And finally the ending which is really what this film is all about. Almost everything you ever feared in your youth both in the light of day and dark of night is compressed perfectly into the film's last few seconds. When the evil suggested throughout finally thunders down like stagnant water through a breached dam the result is possibly the most viscerally disturbing horror sequence ever produced. All exploding skulls bursting rib cages and dangling intestines ever filmed are mere confetti alongside its simple implicit power. Only the discovery of the maternal corpse in the basement in Psycho even comes close. Keep the little ones away from this one Mom and Dad. A child's mind will have no defense nowhere to run and most disturbing nothing tangible to run from only an invisible meticulously goaloriented malevolence that comes from nowhere and everywhere at once.".

It's this mentality that has resulted in my extreme dislike of indie films and their fans and filmmakers. Honestly just because something was made without studio assistance andor interference DOES NOT automatically make it a masterpiece any more than having the hot new centerfold ofthemonth makes the next Michael Bay film an Oscar contender. Yet still the indie zombies insist that it does supposedly this mentality comes from resenting Hollywood's excesses such as taking away artistic control bloated budgets inattention to casting appropriate actors in favor of popular ones and worst of all annoying marketing campaigns. What BS.Indie films are guilty of many hypocrisies but attacking marketing campaigns is their biggest as endless marketing hypealong with pure stupidityis the only reason anyone would have seen this clunker I'm currently reviewing.I can recall quite vividly the endless popup ads the fan sites official andsupposedlyunofficial magazine articles TV. specials the merchandise the relentless TV. commercials. Whew. The people who complain about the 'Dark Knight's marketing campaign just plain weren't ALIVE to not know the extent of this films marketingwhich makes sense since 99.9 of all the negative TDK reviews I've seen couldn't have been written by someone older than 5 or 8. TDK had NOTHING on this film's relentless marketing campaign.Trashing Hollywood for over hyping their products then doing the same that's the definition of hypocrisy. That alone would be justification enough to dislike TBWP and it's indie film moron cult and to call them hypocritical and give the film a 1 rating even if it was a good movie even if I had liked it.The fact that it also sucked as a film anyway just justifies my rating.The common defense is that this is some brilliant 'artfilm' which introduced the concept of not showing the monster and leaving it to the imagination. BS. Val Lewton did the same thing a thousand times better during the '40's with films which are classics of the genre 'Cat People' 'The Seventh Victim'. etc. and in 1963 probably the best of all 'unseen' horror films Robert Wisea disciple of Lewton's 'The Haunting' was released to borrow an indie film fan phrase it PWNED 'Blair Witch'. All classics all achieving their suspense without showing the monster. All before this film.But indie fans ignore all this they claim those movies don't count because they are old and in black  white. Typical response from them no respect for older film.As for the 'story' of this film and it's qualities I wouldn't even give it a D if it was a student film. The device of not showing the monster comes off less as an artistic choice and more an excuse to film nothing but a couple of dumbasses running around and passing it off as a film. I'll admit it's clever heck even Lewton originally adopted the device out of necessity but he did it mostly because he recognized it's dramatic potential in the face of several alternatives. For the record it is also a complete and utter ripoff of a much better film called 'The Last Broadcast' the difference being that there is a survivor. Really otherwise it's the same damn thing and it's the indie film fans who call Hollywood unoriginalIf only I could use the eyeroll emoticon.The story also sucks 'Cannibal Holocaust' did the 'found footage' thing much better. The 'acting' is also awful it's so forced you wonder if the witch is a legitimate legend even in the context of the story. The praise for characterization is true though. I definitely felt something about the characters I wanted all 3 of them dead within a minute. And even if pray tell the device of not showing the monster WAS original or had been used well does it REALLY matter if it's an awful film otherwise? Nope. At best it just revives a longdead gimmick.And for all the people who say it must be good because so many people thought it was real let me ask you something Have you ever heard the phrase 'Idiots will believe anything'? Grow up and watch some atmospheric 'unseen' horror films that are actually good. This is no different than your usual incredibly stupid vapid Hollywood slasher flick with annoying teenage victims only without a slasher and not made by Hollywood but still incredibly stupid  vapid and filled with annoying teenage victims.".

	schema:reviewBody " This comment contains spoilers  As a fan of movies and horror films for 45 years I've seen a lot and I have to say that BWP is a totally amateurish piece of junk.To call this a film is laughable. It has no plot no ending no story. It is the 90 minute rambling of some dunderhead carrying around a hand held camera filming everything he sees. This movie was made by loading some film getting some nobodies together going to the woods and shooting enough film to make up 90 minutes. No film was left on the cutting room floor. Every worthless scrap was included. The ineptitude and total lack of filmmaking skills is astounding. I used to think Robot Monster was the pits BWP is worse.Here is what happens in the film. Three dimwits find a tape made by three nitwits who supposedly uncovered the Blair witch and were never seen again. The three dimwits head into the forest to investigate. Along the way they hear weird noises at night find some sticks hanging from trees get lost in the forest start to cry because they are so scared. In the end one of the dimwits wanders into an abandoned shack and the last scene shows him trying to look scared into the camera. THE END. That's all folks. I'm not kidding. That's the movie.In these times when anyone has access to equipment to make a movie BWP proves the theory that any talent less person can make a film. BWP was the biggest movie marketing SCAM in history. It proves P.T. Barnum's There's a sucker born every minute. By using the internet to lie and hype the film the cynical lug heads who made this suckered people in. As they say in the used car business For every seat there's an ass. I was one of the asses who got suckered. Using the same based on a true story technique as The Amityville Horror BWP lured wellintentioned moviegoers into the theater. If BWP were a car then it would be subject to a lemon law and you could get your money back. Unfortunately the movie business doesn't work that way. Those of us who lost our  on this scam have no recourse. The only recourse I have is to slam this piece of trash in this review which I hope I have done. Why I detest BWP so much is because it was such a shameless scam that showed utter contempt for movie goers. This was not a film it was just a mechanism to cheat people out of their money.I would rather watch Robot Monster ten times than ever see BWP again.".

	schema:reviewBody "Is THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT a masterful ghost film or a gimmick to create a multimedia event?  It is both.  The picture shot on super 8 video and 16mm film displayed in a squared documentarylike frame is quirky annoying and spectacularly scary.  The scenes at night quite frankly scared the hell out of me.  The gimmick that THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is created confusion and wonder over whether or not the footage shot was real life.  Now we all know the truth but the French term 'cinema verite' is defined by this grisly film.A guaranteed cult classic BLAIR WITCH has Heather Mike and Josh heading off into the allegedly hexed woods of Maryland looking for the Blair Witch or whatever else may exist up in those hills.  For most of the film it is very unclear.  The beginning excerpts ingeniously set up the three participants to believe they are a experiencing the supernatural b being played like a fiddle by the suspicious townspeople or c just completely out of their minds.  Its up to the viewer to decide but my money is on option A.Most filmgoers know that the filmmakers Sanchez and Myrick used their MAC cards and cookie jars to put this phenom together and I commend them.  This is a tourdeforce thriller that does indeed seem real.  Its all improvised and 'verite' like and the best part about the movie's many chills are based on the basic premise that scares most of us  We are generally frightened by what we cannot see.  Many times throughout the film the screen is completely dark with sudden bursts of screams and grainy scenery.  For the sake of the suspense the film may have been better if we did not know the gimmick.  The realism is sometimes smothering.True the handheld camera can make you achy in the head but the way the actors play off each other is magic and not for the faint of heart.  I viewed the film on DVD with someone who was not feeling too well because of the dizzying camera but somehow the black and white and color and rain blend together and allow Myrick and Sanchez to do what they were attempting to do.  Spooking an audience with unseen forces is so effective and I was reminded of Robert Wise's original THE HAUNTING from 1963 with the groans and the cries and the shrieks.  A baby's giggle can be heard during one spellbinding scene when the tent the 3 students sleep in takes on a life of its own.Much has been made about a similar film made in similar fashion by some other young auteurs well before THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT was released.  I never saw it and if it was as good as this film we would've seen it. Nonetheless this past summer shocked and surprised me with the amount of good horror pictures around.  In the woods no one can hear you scream either.Rating 12".

Here being a member of The League is a must big hair is still favored by the ladies who lunch and only hairdressers and interior designers are supposed to be gay. The addition of an AIDS facility in Azalea Springs has The League unsettled. And the announcement that their charity work will include contact with those people leaves them stunned. But the real frenzy begins with a drunken comment regarding the local drinking water. Rumor has it that the water is contaminated with something that actually turns people gay. Mix in Brother Daniel's HomoNoMo meetings the local newspaper and a group of rabid homophobic picketers and you've got a recipe for panic. Heads reel. Women weep. Mothers hide your children! In the midst of it all we find Alex Stratton a young woman dealing with a distant husband an overbearing mother and the tedium of meaningless society chatter and endless shoe critics. ...";

The scene when shot was very moving dramatic powerful. Once edited I was amazed that they turned that scene into its own minimelodrama with a comic twist. The whole cast and crew was very friendly. One of the more outstanding moments in the making of the movie was when we were filming in the hospital. In the middle of a scene one of the 1K lights set off the building alarm and sprinkler system made for a short delay but all was well. Kelli provided some of the best craft service food I've ever had much! All behjind the scenes stuff aside The plot is outrageous. Who'd think It's in the Water? Can't say I don't relate though. For whatever reason this is truly one of my favorite movies very smart.".

Sadly the film is as lame as the joke.The story follows the residents of Azalea Springs a small Southern town as they deal with an AIDS hospice opening in their midst. Most who live in the town are unhappy about the idea and more than a few are downright hostile. However Alex Stratton Keri Jo Chapman thinks it's a good idea and despite the objection of her overbearing mother Barbara Lasater and wimpy uncaring husband Matthew Tompkins she goes to work there. Once employed she reunites with Grace Miller Teresa Garrett her best friend from high school. Meanwhile Mark Anderson Derrick Sanders son of the owner of the local paper wants to cover the story in a light sympathetic to the hospice but his father Tommy Townsend is only interested in sensationalistic news. And Mark has a few secrets of his own which he shares with those who attend Brother Daniel's John Addington weekly meetings to cure those with homosexual tendencies. And Spencer John Hallum the requisite wise old queen with great style and wit is busy overseeing the death of his unacknowledged lover. However when Alex and Grace's friendship turns to romance and Mark finds happiness in the arms of Tomas a Latin house painter the whole town is turned upside down. Will these couples be happy together or will the forces of prejudice keep them apart? It's hard to know where to begin with this film. Just about everything in it was poorly done. The writing was atrocious. Characters are merely stereotypes who are not developed at all. Their actions make little sense because they seem to have little motivation. And the dialogue was either painfully wooden or ridiculously clichd. Even the production values weren't very good as the cinematography was rather uninspired.The acting was equally bad. Lasater is so over the top that you stop listening to her tirades and that seems to be all she has in the way of lines pretty early on. Sanders and Townsend are both wooden and show no sense of any kind of fatherson relationship. Tompkins' jilted husband is merely ridiculous and annoying. Garrett attempts to breathe some life into her character but doesn't succeed terribly well. The only one who does reasonably well is Chapman and it's not enough to carry the film.Sad to say I think there was a good premise here but the execution was so poor that it just doesn't manage to generate a film that is either entertaining or thought provoking. In the end it's just a curiosity piece which fails to engage the viewer. You win some you lose some...".

Much recommended both.Though unpolished at spots this is overall a very good indie film. What strikes me and might explain why repeated viewing occurred in my case is the quality of the performances. The female leads by their IMDb profiles are rather thin resumes. One currently is on a syndicated home improvement show the other appears not have had work for years. But they are great.The clueless socialite  who of all things recently played a nurse available free at her IMDb page a very good performance in an AIDS hospital  was also wonderful. Various supporting characters were also very good. For instance the husband ... a thankless role sure but well done. See e.g. the scene before the ball where the problems the couple has is subtly shown. The gay couple gets less play but they are nice too. Great cast.The writing is good as well. It has some rough patches  honestly one highlight scene seemed a bit rushed in a way  but it was equally amusing and heartfelt. The fact the writerdirector was writing from experience up to a pt shined thru. I also am not sure if the water thing totally worked. It ultimately was a bit silly and the true focus of the movie are the two couples.The commentary is also recommended  the wd and the two female leads take part. It addresses some concerns. For instance yes as a satire there are caricatures. Second yes Kelli Herd herself experienced the gospel choir which is why she used it in the funeral scene. She also notes she knows a couple who met in a no mo homo meeting. More info can be found on the website which is available online. The website is now defunct sadly so since it had photos and so forth. I'm sure other concerns were addressed as well. It wasn't as deep as some commentary tracks but overall it was fun to hear the three discuss the movie.Someone noted that the dying guy didn't really look sick. I didn't really think about that but I guess that might be an issue. The decline also happened rather suddenly ... one moment he looks pretty healthy next he is ready to die. Well it is a hospice but still ... but honestly it didn't upset me too much.Another comment noted some characters were mean. Such is life surely in a conservative little town in Texas and it should be pointed out that even the mother did hire the gay decorator. And deep down we see many in the town are good people.Finally I love the expressions on the characters' faces ... were they told to overact in that regard? I don't know but it is quite funny. This includes various expressions of Teresa Garrett Grace in which she looks like she wants to punch Sloan.".

The lead actress reminded me of Sandra Bullock something to do with her upper lip. Her mother was quite the hilarious little drama queen. The movie actually is pretty mild but contains probably the best male erotica scene of kissing that you will ever see. The female scene is better than average but not as hot as Aimee and Jaguar which set the bar for all lesbian scenes. Of course this movie was made before Aimee and Jaguar.The whole movie plays on all those wonderful stereotypes of gays. I loved the guy whose father sent him to therapy and the silly gay church meetings. I knew a very wealthy kid who was sent to therapy by his socially connected mother because he was gay. After about two years the therapist finally told the parents there was nothing wrong with their healthy young gay son but there was probably something wrong with the parents. I do believe most of backwards America started waking up when the kid with AIDS was discriminated against in Indiana. I know the Death Lady Dr. Keubler Rosswas run out of Virginia when she tried to open an AIDS hospice for babies. And I even had an acquaintance who told me that my brother should be dead since he has AIDS.But this movie is quite light not deep and easily watchable by anyone. If you can't handle seeing men kiss you better go and hide. Otherwise sit back and wonder if the lead character's husband wasn't just a little bit gay himself. No sex for six months? Please the way he played with his hair in the reflection of the golf club makes me wonder. Especially since his wife only dated gay men.".

Mind you it does represent a fairly accurate assessment of American tolerance especially down south where the radical religious groups are. My partner and I watched the movie waiting for the comedy to begin. With such a working title as it was the screen writers producers directors etc could have had a field day and come up with a brilliant movie. Stereotypical homophobic characters are simply not funny in movies or really life. What I was expecting was a lovely town with gays in it suddenly thrust into comic scenarios and panic over the state of their water supply. But no instead we got a mish mash of male egos bruised because their wives dares to kiss another female boorish snobby gossipy women.........bah. American Trash is a better title for the film".

My partner and I watched the movie waiting for the comedy to begin. With such a working title as it was the screen writers producers directors etc could have had a field day and come up with a brilliant movie. Stereotypical homophobic characters are simply not funny in movies or really life. What I was expecting was a lovely town with gays in it suddenly thrust into comic scenarios and panic over the state of their water supply. But no instead we got a mish mash of male egos bruised because their wives dares to kiss another female boorish snobby gossipy women.........bah. American Trash is a better title for the film";

A highly cute funny adorable film to anyone. True the idea of a HeMan woman haters club is offensive to all you feminists out there but remember the story of the film took place when these kind of things commonly happen. So what I have to say is this is an excellentquality film for any little rascals  besides the rascals in the film are kinda like Rugrats but they're in the proper age group of kingergarten so if you love seeing cute kid hijinx by all means see this film.".

The antics of the group of young boys and girls in their eternal 'war' against one another is uproarious and a delight to watch. Watch how one of the boys try to stay within the girlhating club while trying to woo a girl at the same time  it'll remind some of us of our childhood just before we enter adolescence.

	schema:headline " Little Rascals is indeed charming but don't kid yourself this movie is heavily flaw as well. Still it is a guilty pleasure of mine. I like it.";
	schema:reviewBody "In the 1990s it seems like every major movie studio in Hollywood was making remakes of classic adventures TV shows about neighborhood kids from mid1930s to the late 1960s. Some of them were minor hits others were horrible retellings like 1993's 'Dennis the Menace'. However the majority of them fall between alltime best great  super awful. 1994's 'Little Rascals' is one such mediocre film. The movie directed by Penelope Spheeris was a little too bog down on nostalgia that it felt like a series of various sketches oddly cobbled together in a paperthin set up about Spanky McFarland Travis Tedford trying to sabotage one of his members Alfalfa Switzer Bug Hall's relationship with Darla Hood Brittany Ashton Holmes in order to get him focus back on track on winning the local gocart derby race. It just doesn't mesh well. Plus all of the sketches really does slow the pacing of the movie down. A good example is all the scenes of the gang trying to make money in order to rebuild their burn down clubhouse like the bank  freakshow scenes. None of those sequences were really that funny nor makes any of much sense with the main plot seeing how the gang have enough material to build another gocart yet not enough for a clubhouse. Honestly the driving force of the plot could had been simple down to the idea that the race had a prize money allalong. It would save the movie a lot of time. Also as much as I love the ballet  soap singing scenes those moments weren't really needed. It does feel a bit forced. It could had been cut if Universal really wanted it like they did with their VHS  DVD releases when it came down to other scenes. Many of these versions are so unlike the original movie we saw in theaters. However most of them works better in watchable. Don't get me wrong I do like seeing the familiar of sight gags and slapstick situations taken straight from the original series of comedy short films produced by Hal Roach from 1922 to 1944 even if its bit sexism  antihomosexual. However I do wish they add more uniqueness with them. Some of the humor seem a bit repetitive recycled  outdated. Even when they did try something new like updating the source material to a modern setting background. It still came across as somewhat jarring because how the children is dressed in 1930s style of clothing. If anything the movie should had kept the 1930s settlings just add new jokes to counteract scenes mirroring shorts like 1937's 'Hearts are Thumps  1939's 'Auto Antics'. Furthermore the movie should add more scenes of the children acting like themselves rather than imitating adult. Lots of the big wordy dialogue given here sounds so unnatural coming from the mouth of a small child. I kinda wish the movie gave them simpler sentences to speak. This film really lacks the raw nuances of child performers acting like real children. Nevertheless not all things about this film were bad. I do like how the cast is more integrated and less racist than the original. Also the main actors were not that bad. Bug Hall  Travis Tedford were born for these roles. There are also some great cameos from Reba McEntire Mel Brooks and Lea Thompson to name a few. Even the sight of future president Donald Trump wasn't that bad. Nevertheless I would love to see more cameos from past 'Little Rascals' alumnus like Jackie Cooper Eugene Jackson  Robert Blake in minor roles in this film. Sadly this movie was lacking some of those. However the movie makes it up with action set pieces with great stunt work. The GoKart race was somewhat compelling to watch even if it's a bit over the top. Also the soundtrack by composer William Ross that goes with it and most of the movie really does seem like it came from yesteryear. It's beautiful to listen to. In short while 1994's 'Little Rascals' will never outdo the original short films from the 1930s1940s. It does beat 1936's 'General Spanky'  2014's 'The Little Rascals Save the Day' in being a better 'Our Gang' film. Overall Watching a kid movie like this is like watching a blender without a lid. It's messy but it's cool to witness. I highly recommended seeing the film. I kid you not.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ah the 90's remake of the Hal Roach shorts from the Great Depression. I liked this movie as a child and most other kids I knew enjoyed it too. Butas an adult I feel differently about it.Spanky Travis Tedford and his best friend Alfalfa Bug Hall are the founders of the HeManWomanHaters Club a club of little boys who get together and do boy things without girls. But when Alfalfa falls in puppy love with a girl named Darla Brittany Ashton Holmes Spanky and his other friends do everything to sabotage the relationship. And when Alfalfa accidentally burns down their clubhouse the other boys have completely had it with him and force him to guard their prized gocart day and night. Meanwhile Darla has fallen for a new rich boy Waldo Blake McIver Ewing but Alfalfa is still determined to get her back. Everything boils down to the local fair when the boys try to win the gocart derby raise enough money to rebuild the clubhouse and mend broken friendships.This movie isweak. The plot itself isn't that bad and most children who watch it are entertained but it's just not good. The overwhelming problem with this film is that none of the kids can act their way out of a paper bag. The fact that none of the kids have been in anything more than a few made for TV or straight to video movies since this proves that. Honestly I found the outtakes of the kids' mistakes funnier than the movie itself. In terms of being based off the original Little Rascals shorts they don't have much to do with them aside from the same looks and names as the originals. That being said it's hard to relate children of the 90s to children of the 20's 30's and 40's. A lot of the old ones are based on poverty hunger and child abuse as a part of their lives along with other themes that were anachronistic or not applicable to children of the 90's. But they tried to integrate some themes like the go cart derby Alfalfa singing and the HeManWomanHaters Club. With that all said this is still a movie that would entertain most children under ten but can quickly get annoying for parents that have to sit through it with them.".

I watched this movie again recently and I must say it was horrible. I am sort of obsessed with the original Our Gangs and this movie was nothing compared to them. A lot of people have said The acting wasn't that great but what can you expect they're kids? I say they found kids for the originals that were genius actors so why couldn't they find any for the movie? Also why did they mix together all the different time periods? Mary Ann Jackson the little girl with the bobbed dark brown hair left the shorts long before Porky ever joined them and they were both in the movie. There were some good moments in the movie like when Spanky's wig got pulled off by a tree but the horrible acting and the way they messed with basically the whole idea of Our Gang overshadows the good moments. And now when I mention in casual conversation that I like the Little Rascals inevitably someone will say Oh yeah I liked that movie too! and start singing I've got a pickle I've got a pickle! or something similar. I'm being generous and giving the movie four out of ten stars because I liked it when I was little. I know I've gone on a long nasty rant but that's really what I think about the movie. Also I'm not sure if this has any spoilers but I didn't want to be blacklisted so I put the notice in just to be sure.".

	schema:reviewBody "Films and television shows that are trying to be cute to gain laughs can be quite irritating. They often rely on the audience gaining some sort of emotional investment out of seeing an adorable baby character or young toddler that says lines that no young kid would say and the usual reaction is Aaawwww! Full House did this for years. These types of cinema have no reason for existence and usually try to serve as cheap entertainment that families can enjoy together. This movie is chalk full of little children doing things children would never do no doubt with the director feeding them lines that they don't understand because they can't read yet. But where this film is different is it's set up. The universe that these little rascals live in isn't the one we live in. It's some kind of parallel universe where children own their own cars and have very elaborate clubhouses and where very young children go on romantic dates. And never once is this particularly corny. What could be a by the numbers movie turns out to be a sort of charming little movie that is fun and funny in a surreal way.Little Alfalfa Bug Hall is in a group of girlhating little boys and they find out about his upcoming romantic date with Darla Brittany Ashton Holmes and they sabotage him. Meanwhile a new rich kid Waldo Blake Ewing has just moved in and Darla finds him quite appealing so Alfalfa is down in the dumps. Hopefully the upcoming gocart race is a chance for Alfalfa to get his lady back in addition to beat Waldo and bond with his child pal Spanky Travis Tedford.This kids in this movie are actually all really good actors and that's one thing that makes this movie work. Bug Hall is one of the better young actors out there and all the ridiculous silly lines that the kids say though kids clearly wouldn't say in real life are said with enough conviction yet with a clear wink from the director and writers. The kids say their lines well but with a slightly over the top script and the mixture comes off as pretty funny. The film runs at a brisk pace with enough jokes to make up for it's overall lack of plot. The sets would have to be pretty cool looking to a child at least they were to me!. The clubhouse that the kids built is designed to look like it was built by kids but at the same time it's so surreally elaborate. And this movie has plenty of surrealism and absurdest humor. Things will happen that make very little sense but come off as hilarious because of how ridiculous the situation is. In one scene during the big race at the end giant daggers come out of a kid's car and start stabbing another car. It's so ridiculous but in the context of the movie it comes off as normal in this universe and jokes like this that might normally seem very over the top play off quite well. If anything was unnecessary here it was the numerous cameos that usually show up for no reason at all. A few of them were funny but most of them seemed somewhat forced. Kids probably won't know who most of these people are anyways so they won't understand that these are cameos.Overall this is a very enjoyable family film with good performances from kids no less and a lot of really silly jokes that hit the mark. In an average episode of Full House I probably cringe about 10 times but in this much longer film featuring even more kids including cameos by the Olsen Twins there was not one moment of cringing. It's actually pretty fun.My rating  out of . 82 mins. PG for some rude humor.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Little Rascals 1994 Dir Penelope Spheeris  Cast Bug Hall Travis Tedford Brittany Ashton Holmes Kevin Jamal Woods Zachary Mabry Misguided family film about trouble and innocence. It regards a group of children who hang out at a club house with a strict rule against girls. This becomes a problem when one of the members is caught courting a little girl. This is the film's first problem. There might be nostalgia for fans of the classic TV show but for a family film this presents themes that may be above the age group this is aimed at. The relationship between one of the Rascals and the girl comes off somewhat disturbing in terms of dialogue that skirts adult. After the club house burns down they attempt to raise money and the method is a kids race for a cash prize. This might have been the proper angle to present this material. Director Penelope Spheeris is coming off great success with Wayne's World but here she is backed by a production that resembles the classic program but without a screenplay worthy of it. It doesn't even seem nostalgic for those whom may celebrate the popular TV program. The young cast play out their roles with certain appeal but the adult communication is a distraction. Another issue is the lack of parents. There is numerous celebrity cameos supporting the show's popularity but the end result is a bigger mess than anything the rascals conjure up. Score 4  10".

All the mannerisms and characteristics were upheld. I liked seeing the big star cameos such as Lea Thompson Whoopi Goldberg Reba and more. The comedy was at the level of the target audience full of children's humor. That's why i say that this film is well made for it's demographic.

Might wanna skip the Donald Trump cameo though lol. 710.";

Some grades were just as icky squirmy over the kisses as the boys in the club. The older kids got more of the jokes but not as many as I did. The younger kids and older kids loved the action. I liked the end where Darla gets tough with the rich kid with Trump saying he was the best son money could buy!! and the girls and boys find they have similar interests and can be friends which was the resolution of the conflict set up by the boys only club as all the boys are converted to appreciating girls. For an adult it was fun to identify the stars that studded the movie. None of my classes showed any recognition of any of the stars including Trump. I didn't give it a 10 because I didn't need some of the words in the race scene words deemed not appropriate in our school and some of the writing seemed too adult even suggestive which was borderline creepy and shouldn't have been included for adults to catch in a children's story and too modern for me to suspend disbelief all the time. The acting was excellent even the animals did well. I'm not a fan of updating shows but this one worked for me. And more than that it worked for the kids. By the way I never liked the original Little Rascals and wouldn't have watched this version if I hadn't been told it was a good one for the children to see.".

	schema:reviewBody "Chang Cheh's FIVE MASTERS OF DEATH aka FIVE SHAOLIN MASTERS 1974 is an allstar kung fu film with five stars playing survivors of the burning of Shaolin Temple and five others as the villains who pursue them and track them down. The heroes split up and travel the Chinese countryside rallying the people to support the faction opposing the Manchus and then reunite about an hour into the film to retrain at the burnedout temple. Then the five villains joined by three henchmen arrive for the sprawling final brawl all staged on a series of Taiwanese locations.Unlike the same director's SHAOLIN MARTIAL ARTS 1974 listed on IMDb as SHAO LIN MARTIAL ARTS and SHAOLIN TEMPLE aka DEATH CHAMBER 1976 this is a fairly lowbudget production and offers no shots of Shaolin or the burning of the temple. At one point the heroes return to the charred 'temple' which looks more like a burnedout storefront. This film forms a trilogy of sorts with SHAOLIN MARTIAL ARTS and SHAOLIN TEMPLE although it takes place immediately following the events depicted in SHAOLIN TEMPLE.The five heroes are played by Alexander Fu Sheng Chi KuanChun David Chiang Ti Lung and newcomer Meng Fei. Fu Sheng and Chi KuanChun starred in SHAOLIN MARTIAL ARTS. All but Meng Fei returned for SHAOLIN TEMPLE. The five villains are played by Liang Chia Jen aka Leung Kar Yan Wang Lung Wei Feng KoAn aka Fung Hak On Chiang Tao and Tsai Hung. The first four were also the villains in SHAOLIN MARTIAL ARTS although only Wang Lung Wei returned for SHAOLIN TEMPLE where he played the same character Ma Fu Yi. Not yet directing films himself Liu Chia Liang aka Lau Kar Leung was cofight choreographer on this one with his brother Liu Chia Yung Lau Kar Wing.Clocking in at 109 minutes FIVE MASTERS is not quite as elaborate or full of spectacle as the other two films in Chang Cheh's Shaolin trilogy but it's got a great cast of fighting stars and nonstop kung fu action and is a cut above the same director's other lowerbudgeted Shaolin films from 197376 HEROES TWO MEN FROM THE MONASTERY DISCIPLES OF SHAOLIN and SHAOLIN AVENGERS.ADDENDUM 62412 I finally watched the R3 DVD edition of this film from Celestial Pictures which is in Mandarin with English subtitles. It clocks in at 105 minutes. I don't know if that's because four minutes were cut or because it was slightly sped up because of the transfer from the PAL encoding system. The latter's more likely. I was pretty amazed at the sheer number of fight scenes in this. It probably has more fight scenes spread out through it than any other Shaw Bros. kung fu movie I can think of. Also I made a few corrections in my earlier review. I still don't understand why a spoiler warning was posted on it.".

They played lots and lots of Shaw Brothers films from the 1970s among other martial arts films.  I remember trying to tune in every Sunday afternoon to get my fix of kung fu action.Anyway these days I barely remember anything about the movies I saw in those days...I remember a scene here and there but nothing major.  One movie though burned itself into my brain and I've never been able to forget it  that film was Five Masters of Death aka Five Shaolin Masters. About six months ago after not having seen this movie for well over a decade I decided to see if it was still as great as I remembered so I hopped on the internet and found a place where I could buy it on VHS.This movie is still excellent.  My VHS copy is of understandably poor quality but the film is still a joy to watch.  Each of the five protagonists specializes in a different style of fighting as do the opposing five antagonists so the film is chock full of great kung fu.  I also find the story to be more engaging and epic in feel than most martial arts movies I've seen however I am far from being an authority on the genre.  The theme music which plays repeatedly throughout is great...it helps give the film its epic feel and is very catchyI find myself singing it in my head for days after watching this movie.At any rate I love this movie.  I wish there was still something like Black Belt Theatre or Kung Fu Theatre on cable so I could catch some more of the Shaw Brothers era of kung fu film.  Martial arts films of today use undercranking and especially wirework far too muchI find myself more impressed by films like Five Masters of Death which rely on natural skills.".

While it can be argued that all martial arts movies are fantasies Chang's films Blood Brothers especially were peopled by vividly wrought threedimensional characters that the viewer cared about. But despite assembling a stellar cast for Five Shaolin Masters it is here that the veteran director begins to eschew character development. Of the titular masters only Fu Sheng has any humanity the remaining heroes David Chiang Ti Lung Chi Kuanchun Meng Fei and all of the villains Wang Lungwei Chiang Tao Fung Harkon Tsai Hung Liang Chiajen are emotionless comic book figures boldly but crudely drawn. From this point forward Chang's characters and plots would become increasingly stylized until he was directing what were essentially liveaction cartoons like Five Element Ninja. The films were still entertaining but with rare exceptions such as The Chinatown Kid were no longer engrossing. But hey I won't get too stuffy in my analysis of what is undeniably an entertaining movie. There are lots of fights both emptyhanded and with weapons and they're beautifully choreographed by Liu Chialiangsoon to become a director in his own rightand Liu Chiayung. Look for brief cameos by the latter and by the Lius' adopted brother Master Killer Gordon Liu. Judged strictly on action Five Shaolin Masters is a winner and fans of the genre will want to see it more than once.".

Because it was after this film that I was being dragged into the Princible's office for trying to flex my Karate skills in the play yard! Of course I was one of those kids who made my own numchucks and bonked kids heads with them until my parents made me dismantle my weapons of destruction. But until then I thought my hands were illegal weapons. I can still recall the day my Mom picked me up from the school and took me to get a milk shake while she proceeded to tell me no more Karate! I'm throwing away your weapons! and that milkshake went down my throat like a brick as the tears swelled in my eyes. I know this isn't much of a review but I want to convey the power this film had on my youth. I wanted to be a killing machine but one of the good guys as well! because this film burnt a hole in my young psyche. Like a lot of things I did abandon my desire to learn Karate. But the film still nestles in a place of my youth and I did finally locate a copy on video. Unfortunately my memory served up a far nicer looking print. The quality looked horrible! But the film was fun to watch again and I might still learn Karate yet. I give it a 10 because it's fun!".

This one is indeed a kung fu classic.";

Plus it teaches to kids that if you want to win you need to pay the price and you need to go through training and discipline.".

	schema:reviewBody "Another epiclooking kung fu flick from the Shaw Brothers empire. This one is familiar to many others in that it pits five good warriors against five evil warriors. That's the plot. The first hour and twenty minutes of the film consists of lots and boy do I mean lots! of action and minor bouts characters dying tragically the bad guys doing evil things and training in preparation for the event. While the final twenty minutes offers up some topnotch martial arts fight sequences in a variety of scenic settings a wood a river a field a mountain the truth is that at an hour and threequarters FIVE SHAOLIN MASTERS outstays its welcome and it is the prolonged running time that stops this from being a classic of the genre.Typically I prefer my action film to be short and snappy and with an emphasis on the action itself. Whilst FIVE SHAOLIN MASTERS achieves the latter there are simply too many extraneous characters in the plot who keep dying and killing each other a lot so much so that its hard to keep track of  let alone care  about what's going on. The only reason I mention this is because it is the film's sole flaw. Otherwise it's wellfilmed stuff with some of the genre's top martial artists Gordon Liu Ti Lung David Chiang et al strutting their stuff plenty of stunts fun plot elements the finger and cup ! signs that the Shaolin use to communicate with each other and heroism.The truth is that the five bad guys in this movie have all of the coolest fighting techniques! There's one guy who swings a huge axe blade around on a rope to chop up and slice apart his enemies another who whips people to death with his long ponytail by breaking their necks! Another baddie uses Bruce Lee's fingers of fury technique from THE BIG BOSS to unpleasantly dispose of another hapless victim. After losing their fights for the entire movie the good guys decide to train for a year ! at the end of the film and finally manage to win out against the baddies but not without loss. Baddies are blinded with weapons two are impaled on a spear and a massive pole fight takes place in a river which is spectacular stuff. The film doesn't skimp on the violence either with plenty of people dying bloody deaths and a high body count. FIVE SHAOLIN MASTERS is a typical kung fu flick from the Shaw Brothers studio and it makes for an actionpacked way to spend an evening.".

We loathe John Colicos as the C.I.A. chief yet he's supposedly working for our side. We like Paul Scofield's Zharkov yet he's a commie. Indeed Scofield who is a master of cold characters has never been so charming. The film offers great action scenes as well as unmitigated suspense. There is a superlative cast and a lot of surprises. Burt ain't named Cross for nothin'. If you are a fan of thrillers or even you aren't this one's a must see!".

	schema:reviewBody "I had seen this years ago and thankfully it was shown again on thisTV out of Indianapolis.Although this film is a great spy thriller it is much more about friendship. Deep friendship. Between enemies and old friends. Not the fleeting digital facebook friendship where facebook folks are friended are defriended with the ease of changing lipstick. But deep 'no questions asked' friendship of life threatening assistance. Do you have any friends like that? I think not. This is more a human story of old loyalties not nameless rule book bureaucrats. There is a very poignant scene in the music hall where Max and Cross are listening to Brahms talking about the favor that Cross needs. Earlier in a cafe Cross tells Max he needs a favor and Max says he will do it no matter what and has the weekend free. Max is a music instructor. In the music hall Cross says the favor may be painful he needs a message delivered to his wife and it will probably kick back to Max. Max doesn't care because after WWII Cross was the one who liberated Max from the camps where he couldn't listen to Brahms without crying. Now after being liberated he can. He dies helping Cross. Who has friends like that?Cross friendships go deep from the hood in DC to a Soviet spy. In fact those friendships transcend race and politics.Scorpio predates Casino Royale in a great foot chase through a construction sight and it also has the intrigue of 3 Days of the Condor. It also predates the Bourne Identity series in that Cross is one step ahead of the CIA most of the time.GREAT LINE SCORPIO I think you better try McLeods chair for fit it is going to be empty soon. Said to 2nd highest CIA guy after learning that an agent of McLeod killed Cross's wife.I liked Cross's coterie of old friends that he relies on for his escape through Europe and in the US. A great entertaining thriller and with Burt Lancaster Alan Deloin and Max Schofield you will have a delightful time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Burt Lancaster and Alain Delon are the star cast of this archetypal seventies spy film where as the final line goes the only rule is to stay in the game. A taciturn Lancaster is Cross a veteran CIA agent who comes under suspicion of double play by the young wisecracks who run the shop. Cross's hitman Jean Laurier aka Scorpio a French mercenary played by Alain Delon is hired by top officer McLeod to get rid of the old man but something tells him there's more to it and he decides to wait. Soon Cross knows the time on his watch and is on the run seeking refuge in Vienna with his KGB counterpart and buddy Sergei Zharkov Paul Scofield in a posture reminiscent of Fernando Rey in French Connection while trying to reunite with his wife Joanne Linville and quit the game. Though not convinced of Cross's alleged defection Scorpio finally agrees to go after him. Ensues a twisted tale of foul play double entendre and grim realpolitik. Though not an unforgettable classic nor by any means an extravaganza and despite obvious flaws  among which the sketchy synchronising some phony dialogue and the occasional action blunder  Scorpio is a highly entertaining and at all times suspenseful flick which hardly ever loses pace and offers a great platform for a nononsense performance by the bulky Lancaster and the sly Delon. Unlike Costa Gavras director Michael Winner clearly chooses story intrigue over naturalism or verisimilitude and turns in a solid thriller with overall likable types. Certainly there is no moral authority here and not even so much as true friendship or love  he who trusts will get stung.".

Though not convinced of Cross's alleged defection Scorpio finally agrees to go after him. Ensues a twisted tale of foul play double entendre and grim realpolitik. Though not an unforgettable classic nor by any means an extravaganza and despite obvious flaws  among which the sketchy synchronising some phony dialogue and the occasional action blunder  Scorpio is a highly entertaining and at all times suspenseful flick which hardly ever loses pace and offers a great platform for a nononsense performance by the bulky Lancaster and the sly Delon. Unlike Costa Gavras director Michael Winner clearly chooses story intrigue over naturalism or verisimilitude and turns in a solid thriller with overall likable types. Certainly there is no moral authority here and not even so much as true friendship or love  he who trusts will get stung.";

The big action sequence is beautifully shot edited and staged  I liked it far better than The French Connection indeed Black Sunday is the only '70s thriller I've seen with better action. It's just so realistic!The biggest flaw I can see is that the major action sequence is so exciting that all the stuff that comes after it can seem a bit dull and overextended by comparison. Still it's good thoughtprovoking material with a cynical Le Carre edge. Without spoiling the end let's just say that whether or not you think it works it certainly has an emotional impact.The supporting cast Joanne Linville John Colicos J.D.

	schema:reviewBody "It's something of a miracle that director Michael Winner was granted access to the Central Intelligence Agency for his filming of 'Scorpio.' This 1972 spy thriller made just after the height of Cold War tensions sheds a nasty light on espionage and had crew members that weren't favorites of Washington. The film's script was cowritten by David Rintels who experienced problems entering the U.S. from Canada on grounds of suspected Communist leanings and its score was composed by Jerry Fielding who was blacklisted from Hollywood during the McCarthy era. In a matter of further coincidence that helped Scorpio's box office its cast and crew were staying at the Watergate Hotel when Richard Nixon's recruits broke into Democratic Party Headquarters supposedly lead actors Burt Lancaster and Alain Delon were in the building when these gentlemen performed their deeds.Controversies aside 'Scorpio' was made after the peak of spy films but rates as an intriguing entry to the genre. It features a solid cast in Lancaster Delon and thespian Paul Scofield while making fair use of Washington Paris and Vienna. 'Scorpio' is certainly not in the upper echelon of spy pictures but it's a decent effort that moves against the grain of standard espionage. Its script by David Rintels in his film debut and Gerald Wilson erases our concept of good and evil depicting the Cold War's underlying operations as a vast endgame where human life is of practically no value and loyalty is regarded as fatal weakness.Lancaster plays Gerald Cross an experienced CIA agent with various contacts in Europe and the Middle East. His superiors including CIA head McLeod John Colicos believe that Cross is serving as a double agent between the U.S. and Soviet Bloc padding his finances along the way. Sensing a threat to national security the CIA forcibly hires Jean Laurier Delon codenamed 'Scorpio' a French assassin who has provided services to the U.S. government. Laurier is logically best for the job since it was Cross who trained him and to whom he revealed his ways of thinking. Cross realizes that he is under surveillance and flees to Europe leaving behind his wife Sarah Joanne Linville. He hides in Vienna with assistance from Serge Zharkov Scofield a KGB agent who befriended Cross while in Iraq.'Scorpio' is a vast labyrinth of political infighting and backstabbing. Wellportrayed by Burt Lancaster Cross is constantly on the move and hopes to reunite with his wife but he's aware that time is inevitably running out. Laurier aptly played by Delon finds himself torn between friendship and his own survival he knows that Cross must be killed but stalls out of his respect for teacher and partner. Laurier is looking to flee the espionage world himself and even deals with betrayal from his fiance Susan Gayle Hunnicutt who works as a courier. Not coincidentally the CIA higherups are depicted as psychotics who won't hesitate to kill off women children and physically handicapped for the sake of 'national security.' 'Scorpio' is in the tradition of spy films where nobody wins and all sides are involved in an endless chain of murder.Lancaster is a strong presence and eyeopening in numerous action scenes especially a construction site chase between Cross and Laurier. Unfortunately Delon's lowkey performance suffers because of this although Delon is steady he is drastically offset by Lancaster and a thick accent sometimes leaves him hard to understand. Paul Scofield is likable and charismatic playing a 'rehabilitated' agent who served years in a labor camp but has not lost faith in the USSR's decrepit ideologies. The supporting cast including John Colicos brings a large amount of energy to their roles.Michael Winner recorded 'Scorpio' about two years before 'Death Wish' which made his name as a director. 'Scorpio' has fairly plain direction and uses fewer of the camera movements and bizarre angles that would saturate Winner's later oeuvre. This is certainly one of his better films although it is lacking in the technical department. Scorpio's dialogue track is sometimes out of kilter with the onscreen actors and there are continuity mistakes like an auto driven by Lancaster that becomes intact after smashing into a carload of federal agents! I sometimes ask if Winner made these goofs as a joke but it does hamper the film's authenticity. Winner cannot be faulted for sticking with cinematographer Robert Paynter 'Hannibal Brooks' 'Superman II' and composer Jerry Fielding. Paynter's images are always clean and efficient while Fielding offers a versatile score that comes together in the finale.MGM latched onto Scorpio's Watergate connection when releasing its DVD in 2000. The case includes a fourpage booklet with trivia on Scorpio's production. Lancaster incidentally didn't consider his role beyond a usual project. The disc presents 'Scorpio' in widescreen with optional French dubbing and subtitles in both French and English. 'Scorpio' has fair visual quality colors are discernible but there is continuous grain and speckling. Narrow black bars are used leaving 'Scorpio' just shy of an open matte presentation. The audio is Dolbyenhanced mono with nonEnglish accents sometimes and unavoidably muddying the dialogue. Scorpio's theatrical trailer is the only DVD extra.'Scorpio' is dated but dated in a good way. The film was made years before production companies replaced acting and scriptwriting with huge effects and 'icons' who merely take up room on screen. 'Scorpio' is cleverly written and relies on the durability of Lancaster Delon and Scofield to keep things in gear. There is always a better spy film to watch  'The Spy Who Came in from the Cold' is one such example  but 'Scorpio' still belongs in the category of highly watchable thrillers and has a large nostalgia value in its cast. out of 4Roving Reviewer  www.geocities.compauljohnr".

Laurier is looking to flee the espionage world himself and even deals with betrayal from his fiance Susan Gayle Hunnicutt who works as a courier. Not coincidentally the CIA higherups are depicted as psychotics who won't hesitate to kill off women children and physically handicapped for the sake of 'national security.' 'Scorpio' is in the tradition of spy films where nobody wins and all sides are involved in an endless chain of murder.Lancaster is a strong presence and eyeopening in numerous action scenes especially a construction site chase between Cross and Laurier. Unfortunately Delon's lowkey performance suffers because of this although Delon is steady he is drastically offset by Lancaster and a thick accent sometimes leaves him hard to understand. Paul Scofield is likable and charismatic playing a 'rehabilitated' agent who served years in a labor camp but has not lost faith in the USSR's decrepit ideologies. The supporting cast including John Colicos brings a large amount of energy to their roles.Michael Winner recorded 'Scorpio' about two years before 'Death Wish' which made his name as a director. 'Scorpio' has fairly plain direction and uses fewer of the camera movements and bizarre angles that would saturate Winner's later oeuvre. This is certainly one of his better films although it is lacking in the technical department. Scorpio's dialogue track is sometimes out of kilter with the onscreen actors and there are continuity mistakes like an auto driven by Lancaster that becomes intact after smashing into a carload of federal agents! I sometimes ask if Winner made these goofs as a joke but it does hamper the film's authenticity. Winner cannot be faulted for sticking with cinematographer Robert Paynter 'Hannibal Brooks' 'Superman II' and composer Jerry Fielding. Paynter's images are always clean and efficient while Fielding offers a versatile score that comes together in the finale.MGM latched onto Scorpio's Watergate connection when releasing its DVD in 2000. The case includes a fourpage booklet with trivia on Scorpio's production. Lancaster incidentally didn't consider his role beyond a usual project. The disc presents 'Scorpio' in widescreen with optional French dubbing and subtitles in both French and English. 'Scorpio' has fair visual quality colors are discernible but there is continuous grain and speckling. Narrow black bars are used leaving 'Scorpio' just shy of an open matte presentation. The audio is Dolbyenhanced mono with nonEnglish accents sometimes and unavoidably muddying the dialogue. Scorpio's theatrical trailer is the only DVD extra.'Scorpio' is dated but dated in a good way. The film was made years before production companies replaced acting and scriptwriting with huge effects and 'icons' who merely take up room on screen. 'Scorpio' is cleverly written and relies on the durability of Lancaster Delon and Scofield to keep things in gear. There is always a better spy film to watch  'The Spy Who Came in from the Cold' is one such example  but 'Scorpio' still belongs in the category of highly watchable thrillers and has a large nostalgia value in its cast. out of 4Roving Reviewer  www.geocities.compauljohnr";

Of course this DID help the moral relativism being pushed in the film.Aside from watching the acrobatic Lancaster do his own stunts and Scofield overact in a fun way this is a very low energy filmand you'd not expect this would be the case for an espionage thriller.

This film has such an awkward moment because of that maybe they could have just died. The scene may have been more dramatic without anything being said.

Despite some dreary loquacious interludes this espionage epic contains some energetic action scenes with Lancaster at his acrobatic best. Cross Burt Lancaster of Valdez Is Coming recruits a former French Foreign Legion soldier Jean Laurier Alain Delon of Purple Noon to assassinate a diplomat at Orly Airport in Paris while a young radical Arab terrorist distracts the authorities. As it turns out Laurier had been paid by the CIA to ice Cross while the two men were in Paris. They fly back to Washington D.C. where they part company on good terms. Cross goes home with his wife Sarah Joanne Linville of Gable and Lombard but isn't surprised that the CIA are maintaining surveillance on his residence. Instead of walking back into CIA Headquarters in Langley Virginia Cross skips town disguised as a priest and flies to Europe. Meantime Laurier is arrested on a trumpedup heroin charge and rudely pistol whipped by a pugnacious D.C. Detective during his arrest. Just to make matters worse the cops barged into Laurier's bedroom while he was snuggled up next to his beautiful girlfriend English Literature instructor Susan Gayle Hunnicutt of The Wild Angels who has been scheming to marry him. CIA official McLeod John Colicos of Raid on Rommel offers Laurier a choice to walk away from a possible 30year sentence if he cooperates and helps the Agency locate and then eliminate Cross. Ironically despite the cutthroat tactics of both the CIA and Cross Laurier appear reluctant to terminate his mentor with extreme prejudice because the man has provided him with so much information to protect himself from people like McLeod and his secondincommand Filchock J.D. Cannon of Cool Hand Luke who desperately want Cross's head on a platter. Cross seeks unofficial asylum from a Soviet Zharkov Paul Scofield of The Train who is an old friend. Meantime McLeod fears that Cross has been selling out to the Soviets. Tensions come to a boil when McLeod's clumsy CIA gunmen kill Sarah and Cross comes back to America with vengeance in his heart. Cross hires an acrobat to step in front of McLeod's car and the fearless fellow hurls himself on the hood brings the car to a sudden stop. While everybody is focused on helping the poor unfortunate man who steps into the oncoming path of the vehicle Cross steals on phantom up to the other side of the car without attracting attention and shoots McLeod dead in the back of his limo.Although he was getting pretty long in the tooth at the time Burt Lancaster doesn't let us forget that he was once a nimble circus acrobat. He has some rigorous moments in Scorpio where it is abundantly clear that the Oscarwinning actor shunned the services of a stunt double. One instance involves him leaping from a high place to plunge across a huge drum in the bottom of a subway station under construction in Vienna. He bounces off the gigantic drum and tumbles to the floor next to in without injury. It is a cool stunt and it is done all in one shot so you know that it was Burt the entire time. The international locations add zest to this tale of friendship and betrayal. Winner directs with his customary brusque style and the mentoring melodrama that occurs here is reminiscent of Winner's earlier film The Mechanic. Lenser Robert Paynter composes some of the tightest compositions that you will ever see. This is one of those spy thrillers where virtually everybody dies. Altogether if you enjoy watching Lancaster Scorpio won't sting you.".

	schema:reviewBody "Scorpio was a film Burt Lancaster didn't think too much of according to a recent biography and after viewing it I can certainly see why.On the plus side Lancaster got to work with former costars Alain Delon from The Leopard and with Paul Scofield from The Train both films considerably better than Scorpio. Too bad he wasn't given something better than a warmed over espionage story.Lancaster is a CIA agent suspected of being a double agent. Word has come from on high to terminate his existence. Not an easy task by any means. Lancaster hasn't survived in the spy business by being a dummy for thirty years.From French intelligence the CIA borrows hitman Alain Delon who has worked and trained with Lancaster.

Of course in the Soviet case I'm sure volunteering was strongly urged.In America however that would have been the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. And during the post World War II McCarthy era that was one of a group of organizations past and present that was considered a Communist front. I'm sorry but there ain't NO WAY that Lancaster with that in his background would have ever gotten a job with the Central Intelligence Agency. And if he did he would have been found out and dismissed back then and there. The whole story falls apart knowing this.There are some nice location shots of Vienna and of Washington DC in Scorpio and acting honors if any go to Paul Scofield. But the film is one colossal waste of time.".

Too bad he wasn't given something better than a warmed over espionage story.Lancaster is a CIA agent suspected of being a double agent. Word has come from on high to terminate his existence. Not an easy task by any means. Lancaster hasn't survived in the spy business by being a dummy for thirty years.From French intelligence the CIA borrows hitman Alain Delon who has worked and trained with Lancaster.

Well definitely up there with other titles such as another Burt Lancaster feature 'Lawman 1971' and some Charles Bronson efforts 'Chato's Land 1971' 'The Mechanic 1972' 'The Stone Killer 1973' and his influential 'Death Wish 1974'. These are some films and Winner's signature style streams through them. Although Winner has many detractors but I don't really see eye to eye with it.'Scorpio' might seem customary but on this occasion there's an old fashion tailoring to it like a thoughtful game of chess. It's a fascinatingly complex sleek and lowkey process than anything explosive. When it's all about the narrative's cunning moves staying one step ahead of your competitor and the skill of deception. The cynical material does come to be dry on the dramatic and emotional front but gains intrigue in the characters and their plights. Action features very little but when it does occur it's worthwhile. Winner's stringently alarming grip nofrills style is gustily suspenseful and brutal. The chase scenes and altercations are effectively pulsating as his got an eye for ballistic action when they come into play due to the overall mellow pace although time flies by and talkative nature with a tough tightlipped script that cements itself in this cat and mouse format. This one gradually builds just like Jerry Fielding's terrifically soaring multilayered hotwire score upon its story to deliver its disguised twists and calculative avenues. The backdrop here largely that of the Vienna's stunningly detailed architecture setting is caught by boldly crisp camerawork as it follows the activity with many angular angles and zooms. True Winner craftsmanship just like his blunt intercutting editing which on this project is probably his most complete. Lending greatly to the setup is a stellar cast. Burt Lancaster is poignantly good in confidently crafty turn as CIA agent Cross that's wanted dead by his own bosses and across from him is a broodingly collected and tactical Alain Delon as the French assassin Scorpio asked to take him out. These are two characters the dinosaur and the new blood that respect each other. There's strong support offered by Paul Scofield John Colicos and Gayle Hunnicutt.".

What makes this one is the locations  having been to Vienna I sat across from the opera house in the exact place where one scene was shot. The streets the hotel lobbies and the rooms were unmistakably European. The cast is excellent with Lancaster doing a great job  and his own stunts at the age of 59  as a down to earth tired agent. Scofield is effective as Zharkov a Communist friend who helps Cross and John Colicos is very good in a typical role for him as Cross' coldblooded boss. Delon isn't quite in the league of these actors  he brings a kind of lethargy to his role and is almost too internalized plus his accent is quite thick so some of his dialogue is difficult to understand. You can't beat him for eye candy though.I've enjoyed other spy films better but this one written by David Rintels my cousin's brotherinlaw is good with the right atmosphere and some dandy performances.".

In a move which leaves him wracked with guilt Zach cancels dinner with his wife in order to go out with Bart. He is inexplicably drawn to this man who seems intent on keeping him at arms distance.

	schema:headline " A totally underrated groundbreaking film";
	schema:reviewBody "I remember hearing about this film long before it came out.  Living in a small eastern Ontario town in Canada in 1982 a town with an army base no less I thought that as much as I wanted to my chances of seeing this film were pretty slim unless I could somehow make it to a big city.  Finally I lucked out and the film did come to our town as part of a doublebill along with Neil Simon's I Ought To Be In Pictures.  I remember watching as this movie the second feature started and silence descended upon the entire theatre.  You could have heard a pin drop.  As the movie progressed and we got to the scene where Zack and Bart lovingly kiss for the first time there was pandemonium in the theatre.  It seemed like half the audience got up. People were yelling abusive epithets at the screen and storming out of the theatre in droves.  As a young man on the brink of committing suicide because of feelings I didn't understand and had no relation to  this movie saved my life.  For the first time in my life after watching this film I could identify with someone else and I knew there were other people like me in this world.  I thought then and I think now twentytwo years later that all the people involved with this film took tremendous chances and showed great courage in seeing to it this movie was made.Say what you will about the soap opera type plot and making the movie more palatable for mainstream tastes the fact remains that this was in its time a groundbreaking film. I know many other people who have been profoundly touched by this film.  Several years ago I ran a group for gay men in various stages of coming out.  One night I showed them my own personal copy of this film. Nearly all who were viewing it for the first time were still totally mesmerized and awed by the courage shown by all involved with this film particularly Harry Hamlin and Michael Ontkean. Both of these actors were already popular established actors at the time this film was made and both of them took tremendous risks with their careers by taking these parts. For a movie to actually show two men in a loving relationship and to actually show two men kiss each other on the lips was amazingly brave.  As was pointed out elsewhere on this board Tom Hanks and Antonio Banderas would not even kiss in the 'critically acclaimed' Philadelphia and that was many years later. Kate Jackson was fresh off Charlie's Angels when she took the part of Claire.  Kate did a wonderful job in this film and held her own against two powerful actors.  Her powerful speech to her husband after he comes out to her gave many women the words to say to their husbands.All of these years later I don't think there is a finer 'coming out' film than Making Love!".

Then business fell off when word got out that this was boring. In some way it isthey go out of their way to please everybodygays and straights. The film lacks an edge that could have made it stronger BUT in 1982 Hollywood was very timid about this subjectthis probably went as far as studio executives would allow it.Credit goes to Hamlin and Ontkean for playing gay characters very rare in those days and sharing a long passionate kiss together. Also they both gave good performancesespecially Hamlin. The real surprise was Kate Jacksonshe was INCREDIBLE in her role. When her husband comes out to her her reaction is utterly believable and actually had me crying the first time I saw it.It's kind of sad that people still think this is gay propaganda as one poster here does. It's just a compelling drama about a man coming to grips with his sexual orientation.Seen today the movie may seem dated and WAY too timid but this was the first major Hollywood film to deal realistically with gay men.

	schema:reviewBody "I don't understand the number of reviews that refer to this movie as being ahead of its time.  The time was clearly right for this movie.  By 1980 the gay and lesbian community had finally become fed up with movies portrayal of homosexuals as either the predatory lesbian or the flamboyant faggot who best case ended up alone and bitter at the end of the movie or worst case ended up dead.  When scripts for Cruising and Windows were leaked to the gay and lesbian community with their depiction of gay men and lesbians as the underbelly of society stalkers and murders there were attempts to disrupt location shoots and when the movies opened there were protests and boycotts with posters saying Stop Cruising and Close Windows.  I have to believe that this sent some sort of message to the studios because two years later 1982 Making Love was released along with Personal Best.Though I don't believe this movie was ahead of its time I do believe it to be groundbreaking.  Prior to 1982 positive depictions of gay men and lesbians in film were either rare covert or nonexistent.  1980's Happy Birthday Gemini was a positive though not really well done coming out comedy but completely devoid of any even remotely sexual physical contact. What made Making Love and Personal Best unique was not just that that they dealt with gaylesbian subject matter in a more positive way but that the characters actually had sex.  After decades of heterosexual sex being portrayed as everything from curtains blowing in the wind to anal sex with butter in Last Tango in Paris this was the first time homosexuality in mainstream film was anything more than theoretical though sex between Ontkean and Hamlin was portrayed more as a rolling around wrestling match than as the title making love.This film is flawed it is soap opera like and melodramatic and the documentary style talking to the camera scenes don't really work.  But there is no denying that it is a big step forward from the films of just two years before.  It is a step that got us to the point where there now are characters in film who just happen to be gay and lesbian because in society there are people who happen to be gay and lesbian.  Even though it might not be a great film it is an important film.A few final comments about the actors.  First I never understood the common wisdom that playing gay would kill a career.  If Clash of the Titans didn't kill Harry Hamlin's career nothing could.  Second I've always been disappointed in Kate Jackson's career.  She became a TV star in an era where the crossover from TV to movies was difficult.  Then she was unable to do Kramer because of Charlie's Angles obligations.  Then she did this movie and her performance was ignored because it's not the sort of film that the Academy is going to recognize and ironically she would have been up against Streep had she been nominated.  I wish her better things than another Satan's School for Girls sequel.".

Prior to 1982 positive depictions of gay men and lesbians in film were either rare covert or nonexistent.  1980's Happy Birthday Gemini was a positive though not really well done coming out comedy but completely devoid of any even remotely sexual physical contact. What made Making Love and Personal Best unique was not just that that they dealt with gaylesbian subject matter in a more positive way but that the characters actually had sex.  After decades of heterosexual sex being portrayed as everything from curtains blowing in the wind to anal sex with butter in Last Tango in Paris this was the first time homosexuality in mainstream film was anything more than theoretical though sex between Ontkean and Hamlin was portrayed more as a rolling around wrestling match than as the title making love.This film is flawed it is soap opera like and melodramatic and the documentary style talking to the camera scenes don't really work.  But there is no denying that it is a big step forward from the films of just two years before.  It is a step that got us to the point where there now are characters in film who just happen to be gay and lesbian because in society there are people who happen to be gay and lesbian.  Even though it might not be a great film it is an important film.A few final comments about the actors.  First I never understood the common wisdom that playing gay would kill a career.  If Clash of the Titans didn't kill Harry Hamlin's career nothing could.  Second I've always been disappointed in Kate Jackson's career.  She became a TV star in an era where the crossover from TV to movies was difficult.  Then she was unable to do Kramer because of Charlie's Angles obligations.  Then she did this movie and her performance was ignored because it's not the sort of film that the Academy is going to recognize and ironically she would have been up against Streep had she been nominated.  I wish her better things than another Satan's School for Girls sequel.";

	schema:reviewBody "The one good thing you can say about this film is that it has a good heart. It's honest and well intentioned. It was groundbreaking in 1981 in that it was released from a major movie studio 20th Century Fox and portrayed gay characters and homosexuality in a positive light something that had not been done up to that point. I don't believe it did very well at the box office then and off the top of my head I can't recall if another major movie studio backed another film with a gay central character in a positive light. Michael Ontkean gives a sincere and effective performance as a young doctor coming to terms with his conflicting reality. He loves his wife deeply but is no longer able to deny that he is gay. He is believable and sympathetic even as he navigates his way through what is unfortunately a horrible script. Harry Hamlin and Kate Jackson meet with considerably less success. Hamlin seemed to be calculating every dramatic point with a wink to the 1980's audience that telegraphed I don't really like playing this part but I need some career visibility. There was a lot of speculation at the time about how doing these roles might affect the leading men's careers. I took this as hedging by Hamlin against jeopardizing future roles because playing gay was not the crown jewel then that it is today. So it was a little frustrating to see Michael Ontkean giving his heart and soul to his character when his costar was essentially a piece of wood. I think Ontkean's career did suffer from doing this role. He is an excellent actor and it's a shame we didn't see his career launched from this role. Instead it was sort of stunted. The script is very bad and some of the dialog is wince worthy. The score was lifted straight from an elevator. It really is sappy. But somehow because of it's genuinely good heart and a fine performance from Michael Ontkean by the close of the movie your eyes are misty. As the movie ends there is a tinge of sadness but also a sense that all is OK. Roberta Flak singing Making Love over the credits is the perfect final touch. In spite it's many flaws Making Love is worth seeing. I can revisit this movie and not be at all sorry because the story not the script and Michael Ontkean pull me through with their honesty and sincerity.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie for the first time last night and have been reading the comments here with some interest. Having read in the past that it was nothing more than a soap opera to my great surprise I found the movie to be subtle and very stylish with fine performances and production values. It seems to me that the recent movie it is most like is Far From Heaven in that the writer and director of Making Love uses the same narrative strategy  recreating the Hollywood romance  but adds twists that illuminate what was not spoken of in the genre before. In Making Love the title speaking to the difference between sex and love we see the characters watch An Affair to Remember and there are other movie quotes of that genre. Claire and Zack share a somewhat improbable passion for Gilbert and Sullivan and have been befriended by an elderly woman the great Wendy Hiller who had loved a poet killed in WW1 who was a friend of Rupert Brooks another poet killed in that war. So the theme of physical love being separate from emotional love and devotion is set up. This is the life that Zack refuses to accept either for Claire or himself in the scene in which he renounces their marriage declaring that she must have a marriage in all senses of the word just as he must. Although they break up in the final scene we see that Claire has settled for a good marriage but one which lacks the heady excitement of her time with Zack. By naming her child 'Rupert' she in effect makes him be Zack's the child they always wanted together. And Zack too has to settle for a good man although not the man he first loved.So it's an elegant and nuanced structure given the sleek gloss that declares it to be quite frankly 'a movie'. It's an intelligent strategy in that it shields what might be a less than sympathetic audience from having to deal with anything too threatening. We've all read comments by those selfconsciously straight posters who must insist on sharing how 'grossed out' they were. Stories of soldiers all but rioting at screenings of the movie. Such babyish acting out is still sadly very much with us. Indeed it almost seems to be a sport for straight men  competing to see who can be most grossed out.Other points of interest seeing this movie now The gay bar. The men are quite ordinary looking. Compare this to the relentless 'hotness' of all the men seen in movie representations of gay bars now.Of course the big difference is that AIDS is nowhere in sight. Though the epidemic may have been under way it's nowhere visible in the movie.Michael Ontkean is very believable and his dilemma is treated seriously. And more sympathetically than the same dilemma in Far From Heaven.Of course having straight men play the parts distances the actors from the sex but again the director deals with this by abstracting the sex into movie terms. It's no more or less real than watching Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr.How grownup it seems. In some respects it is a more adult take than the current movie romance Brokeback Mountain. It may be less frank about the mechanics of sex but it allows the characters to grow and achieve a realistic adult life. Not perhaps having it all though they do get have great apartments and clothes. but that's part of the style but having something worthwhile and treating their regrets as an inevitable part of life. The final shot  very Douglas Sirk  of Claire returning to her domestic life while Zack takes a different fork in the road sums up the movie's point of view with great elegance and wit.So watch it. It's fascinating to see how far we've come and how much we've retreated. Compared to the dishonest posturings of Philadelphia this movie really has something to say and says it very well. Directed with enormous skill the performances are firstrate and Kate Jackson is more than that. It's a performance that should have led to a big movie career.".

The screenplay is equally satisfying tugging at your heartstrings without being overly sentimental or maudlin.Ontkean is Zack Elliott a handsome young physician who has spent his life thus far as a compassionate and dedicated doctor husband and son. In all of his commitment to do the right thing he has been suppressing the fact that he is indeed gay. Because of his stalwart ethics he comes to the realization that he can no longer deceive his devoted wife. Ontkean shines as a man who is overcome with internal turmoil yet through the love for his wife is determined to do what is best for her more so than even himself. The precepts of selfsacrifice honesty and integrity in the Ontkean and Jackson characters is much of the appeal of the story. Jackson is convincing as Claire Elliott the wife who despite her initial feelings of anger and betrayal experiences acceptance understanding and ultimately unconditional love. An especially touching moment comes in the final scene when despite her best efforts to be super human she subtly reveals her sense of loss after a brief reunion with Zack.Hamlin is Bart the openly gay randy selfinvolved West Hollywood habitu and Zack's first samesex encounter. Through narration and in his intimate dialog with Zack he too exposes his humanity need for acceptance and sense of loss at the foregone opportunity of a serious relationship with Zack. This is a surprisingly underrated landmark film in that it serves as a rare bridge between the pre80's depiction of gay men as mincing selfloathing social misfits and the heavyhanded political correctness of the marginalized queer cinema to follow. In contrast to today's movies there is a near absence of trendy fashions catchphrases soundtrack and banal preachy social conceits of the moment. That's what sets this apart as an enduring film.".

The film explores not only the idea of an individual coming to grips with his true sexuality but provides the viewer with reasons why.  It does an excellent job of depicting not only Zack's 'coming out' but the emotional stages both he and Claire go through beforeduring and afterwards.There were a few weak miniscenes segue ways into bigger more important scenes that would of or rather could of been done better but when one sees this film today one must take into account that this was still a rather taboo subject and not many people including gays and lesbians were talking about. I strongly suggest seeing this film on video it has an excellent message not only about 'homosexual love' but about 'loving another person'period!".

We got into the theater and he said You need to really pay attention to this movie. This is why I did not will never and can not every marry you. I love you way too much to hurt you in this way. It wouldn't be fair to either of us. Well I swallowed every word and every action in that movie and when it was over I cried. I cried like a baby. I now knew all of it. I knew what he was struggling with in front of me and his parents siblings and classmates all the time. I figured out he wasn't teasing me when he'd tell me that some guy had a nice backside. He was for real. I am so happy he took me to see Making Love. Well he has since passed away and there is not a day that goes by that I don't think of him.

This was the first mainstream film that dealt with the feelings of coming out.

Granted Tom Hanks played a Gay man in a 'public friendly' Philadelphia and let us not forget the 'jolly queens' of The Birdcage. Those 2 films are travesties of the first order because they trivialized what being a Gay man in America is all about and made them socially acceptable for a generally Homophobic Public.I truly love Brokeback Mountain but do hold a high regard for Making Love and what it represents.".

The movie with all of it's flaws is still one of my favorites. I have to give credit to Hollywood for stepping out and taking a chance along with the actors. For the time period it was perfect and still holds up to high standards of film making but is nevertheless still pushed to the background.

	schema:reviewBody "Before Ennis and Jack discovered their true sexual selves on Brokeback Mountain Making Love opened up a lot of eyes in presenting the gay male culture right before the beginning of the AIDs plague. We learned that gay males indeed come in all shapes and sizes and libidos.I have to say I really identified with Michael Ontkean's character here more than with the two in Brokeback Mountain. Stripped of the cowboy mythology Ennis and Jack are a pair of blue collar working stiffs who live in that part of society. It's just that a film about a pair of gay plumbers wouldn't have really done all that well.Ontkean's character had my middle class upbringing. He's a doctor happily married to the beautiful Kate Jackson and they are happy. But Mike's got those feelings that society has told him are wrong. If you're suppressing them I'm here to tell you that just like in the film sooner or later they surface and explode under any kind of stress.He strikes up an acquaintance with one of his new patients writer Harry Hamlin after making a few false starts into the gay world. That was roughly paralleling my experience I wanted the first to be special especially since my best youthful years were behind me. It was as special to me as Harry Hamlin was to Michael Ontkean.One of the things I liked best about Making Love is that it made no judgments about either of these guys. Ontkean wants a relationship and I'm betting if he were alive today he'd be breaking down the doors of his legislature in California and working real hard to overturn Proposition 8. That's not what Hamlin wants and he had a good chance of ending up with AIDs. But even as the plague was on the horizon and not a factor in gay life yet Making Love makes no condemnation of Hamlin at all. It's just the randy way he is like so many straight men looking to score with all kinds of women.Kate Jackson is the tragic figure here as well. But tragic in the sense that she's a victim of Ontkean's internalized homophobia which caused him to marry and seek society's approval rather than follow his own nature. So many marriages went south because of that but Making Love affixes the blame on our attitudes not on either of the men. It is fortunate that no kids were yet involved.Making Love was a reunion film of sorts as both Ontkean and Jackson were regulars on the Seventies police drama The Rookies. They weren't paired together however Ontkean was one of the three rookie cops the series concentrated on and Jackson was married to Sam Melville who was another one. Ontkean left the series midway in its run to pursue a film career. Director Arthur Hiller includes a stylish cast to support Ontkean Hamlin and Jackson. Arthur Hiller and Nancy Olson are Ontkean's parents and Dame Wendy Hiller plays Ontkean and Jackson's lovable but slightly dotty neighbor. Look fast and you'll see Eighties action star Michael Dudikoff as one of the delightful items to be found in the cruising bar. In its time Making Love was as groundbreaking a drama as Brokeback Mountain is in the new century. And this review is dedicated to my personal Harry Hamlin USMC private Donald Buchecker of Consohocken Pennsylvania. I hope you made it through the plague.".

	schema:headline " Glossy Melodrama of a Doctor's Sexual Reawakening";
	schema:reviewBody "Although Zach is a doctor and Claire is a televisionprogramming executive the young attractive and successful couple are prepared to budget so they can afford their sprawling dream house. The McMansion is spectacular their careers are going up hill and they are evidently in love both physically and emotionally. The Elliotts are the perfect uppermiddle class American couple typical of daytime soap operas and cinematic melodramas. However a cloud peeps over the horizon when Zach spots two handsome young men together on a motorcycle and before the audience can catch its collective breath Zach drives down a cruising alley invites a guy into his car and frequents a gay bar. A few heartbeats later Zach is locking lips and rolling in the hay with Bart a sexy young writer. Evidently Zach's sexual repression has been stretched to the breaking point and although his path to that crucial point is not clearly delineated he is ready to make up for lost time.Arthur Hiller's ohsotasteful Making Love was daring and bold in 1982. Twentyseven years have wrought many social changes not to mention Brokeback Mountain. Contemporary audiences may be impatient with the film's pacing and the scenes where the three main characters talk directly to the camera arguably destroy credibility. The audience will wonder if the three principals are undergoing joint therapy and talking to a psychoanalyst or if they are in a filmed play and addressing the audience. Either way the effect is jarring. However the cast is quite good although Wendy Hiller as a retired actress friend of the Elliotts is so skilled and effortless that she upstages the younger actors in her few scenes. Kate Jackson of the wonderfully distinctive voice is effective as the wife who feels betrayed and initially tries to ignore her husband's revelation. Michael Ontkean is good as Zach although the part does not make any demands on his talent. Harry Hamlin also does well as Bart the writer who wants to be alone with his collection of old movies.Fortunately neither Ontkean nor Hamlin plays gay and the audience is spared any lisping or effeminate gestures. The film actually bends in the other direction and shows the two men engaged in sports arcade games and other nonstereotypical activities. The script demands that the audience accept mature intellectual discussions and informed decisions from obviously well educated characters. Despite any credibility gaps that modern viewers may spot Making Love remains entertaining in a glossy melodramatic style that is just a cut above TV fare. Unfortunately Lana Turner could have wrung more tears and emotion out of Claire's character Montgomery Clift could have soul searched with more depth as Zach and Troy Donahue could have epitomized the unattainable male sexual ideal. The film has the makings of an overthetop melodrama in the grand style of Imitation of Life or Portrait in Black which only a Ross Hunter could have realized. Rather than pull out all the stops Arthur Hiller has directed the film with a sturdy hand and a tasteful eye. Making Love is a melancholy tale that leaves viewers with a wisp of sadness for all involved. Perhaps that undercurrent was a cautionary moral for the early 1980's just before the scourge of AIDS would add a darker tone to this fable.".

Evidently Zach's sexual repression has been stretched to the breaking point and although his path to that crucial point is not clearly delineated he is ready to make up for lost time.Arthur Hiller's ohsotasteful Making Love was daring and bold in 1982. Twentyseven years have wrought many social changes not to mention Brokeback Mountain. Contemporary audiences may be impatient with the film's pacing and the scenes where the three main characters talk directly to the camera arguably destroy credibility. The audience will wonder if the three principals are undergoing joint therapy and talking to a psychoanalyst or if they are in a filmed play and addressing the audience. Either way the effect is jarring. However the cast is quite good although Wendy Hiller as a retired actress friend of the Elliotts is so skilled and effortless that she upstages the younger actors in her few scenes. Kate Jackson of the wonderfully distinctive voice is effective as the wife who feels betrayed and initially tries to ignore her husband's revelation. Michael Ontkean is good as Zach although the part does not make any demands on his talent. Harry Hamlin also does well as Bart the writer who wants to be alone with his collection of old movies.Fortunately neither Ontkean nor Hamlin plays gay and the audience is spared any lisping or effeminate gestures. The film actually bends in the other direction and shows the two men engaged in sports arcade games and other nonstereotypical activities. The script demands that the audience accept mature intellectual discussions and informed decisions from obviously well educated characters. Despite any credibility gaps that modern viewers may spot Making Love remains entertaining in a glossy melodramatic style that is just a cut above TV fare. Unfortunately Lana Turner could have wrung more tears and emotion out of Claire's character Montgomery Clift could have soul searched with more depth as Zach and Troy Donahue could have epitomized the unattainable male sexual ideal. The film has the makings of an overthetop melodrama in the grand style of Imitation of Life or Portrait in Black which only a Ross Hunter could have realized. Rather than pull out all the stops Arthur Hiller has directed the film with a sturdy hand and a tasteful eye. Making Love is a melancholy tale that leaves viewers with a wisp of sadness for all involved. Perhaps that undercurrent was a cautionary moral for the early 1980's just before the scourge of AIDS would add a darker tone to this fable.";

No one dies or wishes they were dead and no one kills anyone because they are gay. It's a deeply satisfying love drama much the same as The Way We Were.I have a tremendous respect for Barry Sandler who wrote the screenplay. In another time and place this film would have succeeded. The film is an important part of film history for several reasons. It was the very first mainstream Hollywood film to deal openly with Gay subject matter in a positive way. It proved that male actors in Hollywood could play gay roles. However neither of the male leads careers were ever the same again because of the film. Harry Hamlin couldn't get work for five years and Michael Ontkean career as a leading man came to a screeching halt.  In the new DVD release of the print Paramount has removed the original warning message since the film is quite tame by today's standards. However I think it should have stayed there as a reminder to us all of how narrow minded and prejudice our American society can really be.Watch this back to back with Brokeback Mountain and you'll see how groundbreaking this film really was. In 1982 critics and audiences jeered at this film and now in 2006 critics and audiences are praising Brokeback Mountain.".

	schema:headline " Better than I expected";
	schema:reviewBody "I didn't expect a lot from 'Beowulf' for lots of reasons most of which were to do with the casting incorrigibly cockney Ray Winstone as a warrior from what's now southern Sweden wacky John Malkovich as a cynical counselor loony Crispin Glover as a fleshrending monster and weirdest of all Angelina Jolie as the monster's mother...thaet waes wundorlic castyng as the poet might have put it. Then there was the way they did the whole thing in CGI running the risk of making it all look a bit rubbery. Finally Robert Zemeckis is the director and my great respect for him plummeted through the floor and into the crawlspace after he presided over the insufferable 'Forrest Gump'.Nevertheless this is a lot better than I thought it would be. I missed the 3D incarnation as we were watching the DVD rather than the cinema release but after a while you stop looking at the CGI and start enjoying it. This is a 'Beowulf' where the story although different from the poem is actually very far from shabby.Without giving too much away the main difference from the poem is that in the poem there is no connection between the monster Grendel and his mother on one hand and the dragon in the latter half of the poem on the other hand. In the film a connection exists. Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary do a professional job of tying it all together in a satisfying Hollywood way without betraying the basic darkness and sadness of the story it's not like Beowulf rides off into the sunset with Wiglaf at the end. Crispin Glover is genuinely scary as the tormented and rawboned Grendel whose main problem is that he just can't stand the sound of people having fun although since most of this fun consists of hairy men singing lewd songs you can see his point. Angelina Jolie's animated self spends all her on screen time walking around without any clothes on something that apparently gave Jolie a blush when she saw a cut of the movie. One of the more eerie things about this film is that the cartoon Angelina Jolie looks marginally more realistic than the actress herself.Despite an accent that's more Stockwell than Geatland Ray Winstone does a fine sombre job as the hero although my wife thought that the animated Winstone looked more like Sean Bean. Brendan Gleeson does a splendid job in the niche he's carved for himself of Hairy Sidekick. The acting honours or at least the animation honours go to Robin Wright Penn or whoever worked on her character as the pale and melancholy queen she has moments of subtle hesitation and sadness that struck me as a triumph of CGI acting. There is much excellent smiting some of it unfortunately toned down a little in order to keep a PG13 rating  so we don't actually get to see Grendel biting men's heads off just people's reactions to him doing so. Most importantly the story is not a travesty of the original. It's thoughtful and interesting as you'd expect from a writer of Gaiman's quality if not from the author of 'Killing Zoe' and contains some striking meditations on the power of legend and reputation. Plus there's a really huge kickass dragon. 'Beowulf' is a strange and unexpected treat.".

	schema:reviewBody "When going into the theatre to see this I in two minds  it was my first 3D movie and I had heard good things however I wasn't particularly taken by the concept or the trailers. I was unsure what to expect however I ended up leaving the cinema extremely satisfied with the film and tellingly unable to stop discussing it long after the ride home.Visually it is an absolute treat Zemeckis uses 3D superbly some of the camera angles and sequences are as great an art as the photorealistic animation. Occasionally the odd shot appears where the impression is that it was set up solely to emphasise the 3D e.g. starting at the end of a branch and panning out and whilst this doesn't add to the film it is actually a pleasant reminder of the novelty of 3D.There are only two areas that let Beowulf down aesthetically the eyes and the mouth. The eyes were static throughout and it is the little details that make the difference when trying to make something as uberrealistic as this such as the fact that the pupils didn't react to light. As for the lips  they're just not quite there yet  sometimes the speech didn't seem to be quite right.The characters are expertly introduced and developed most notably Anthony Hopkins character Hrothgar and the tension between his wife. Grendell and his mother are wonderfully creepy and seductive and bizarrely enough almost encourage sympathy.For me the most disappointing part of the film was actually Ray Winstone as the titular character  he was fantastic when talking in a low growl however the film really suffers when he shouts in full cockney accent. I will kill your monstah!. I half expected Grendell's head to be smashed between a car and it's door. John Malkovitch is a saving grace with his nonemoresinister voice and interesting faith subplot.The rating for this film has been hotly discussed and in my opinion I do not think it is suitable for children under the age of 12. Grendell would have truly terrified me as a child. The violence as well as bawdiness does not make it a family film for young children although having said that the lewd references do provide good humour and balances out the movie.So overall this was worthy of an 8. Breathtaking animation incredible action especially the finale featuring an excellent dragon and a generally brilliant cast. Beowulf throws down the gauntlet to filmmakers to show what can be done with 3D and is an indication of the potential. It's not all the way there yet but it's a damn good start.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is a lot of fun. In 3D. I suspect its impact will be considerably diminished in 2D so I urge anyone who wants to see it to seek out the 3D version. There are lots of beautifully constructed tracking shots where the camera glides and swirls forward back up and down and trees rocks arrows dragons or whatever slip past the edges of the frame and this effect is stunning in 3D. In fact all the action scenes are stunning in 3D particularly the climactic battle with a topnotch fire belching monster of a dragon.The plot isn't much to write home about although there's just a hint of a theological debate about the way Christianity has displaced the old mythic religions which made me think for about 5 seconds. The acting is variable  Robin WrightPenn is fine but about as sexy as a paper cup Hopkins is his usual reliable self Ray Winstone is suitably heroic as the heroic selfaggrandising Beowulf and Crispin Glover is just brilliant as Grendel. Grendel is a lovely creation oozing slime and blood and wracked with pain.But who cares about all that. This is not a scholarly work it's entertainment. And my wife and I were as royally entertained as the kids surrounding us in the cinema and we're both 40somethings. Leave your serious head and any timid youngsters at home and go and have fun.".

There are lots of beautifully constructed tracking shots where the camera glides and swirls forward back up and down and trees rocks arrows dragons or whatever slip past the edges of the frame and this effect is stunning in 3D. In fact all the action scenes are stunning in 3D particularly the climactic battle with a topnotch fire belching monster of a dragon.The plot isn't much to write home about although there's just a hint of a theological debate about the way Christianity has displaced the old mythic religions which made me think for about 5 seconds. The acting is variable  Robin WrightPenn is fine but about as sexy as a paper cup Hopkins is his usual reliable self Ray Winstone is suitably heroic as the heroic selfaggrandising Beowulf and Crispin Glover is just brilliant as Grendel. Grendel is a lovely creation oozing slime and blood and wracked with pain.But who cares about all that. This is not a scholarly work it's entertainment. And my wife and I were as royally entertained as the kids surrounding us in the cinema and we're both 40somethings. Leave your serious head and any timid youngsters at home and go and have fun.";

	schema:reviewBody "I have read Beowulf a couple of times. It's great northern European mythology and mandatory reading when you are young in my opinion Along with Norse Greek and Roman Mythology as well. And though the movie wants to rewrite some of the epic you will need to separate the Hollywood version from the beautiful measure of the original works. Being a work of CGI you will also have to allow for the flaws of pure CGI work. Very stylized and beautifully colored it is an epic adventure that elevated Zemeckis' previous work The Polar Express to a new level. Polar was beautifully modeled after Chris Van Allsburg illustrations for his book but Zemeckis' adaptation to the story went a little over the top when it became a musical. Even though most of Beowulf's story line is answered here it did make me pause and wonderWhy didn't Robert Zemeckis just direct this thing in real life instead of virtual?With the capabilities of dropping in CGI into real life action this telling of the story could have had so much more of an impact if the expressions were more poignant. Look what he did with Who Framed Roger Rabbit?? Zemeckis is fully capable of it. Also to add to this when you have CGI characters like Jacksons Gollum and King Kong to compare notes with the modeling here just isn't up to snuff. I felt the entire movie came off like a gigantic cutscene to a video game than a full featured animated project. I can only give this a little better than a good hence the exclamation. I do this sadly. You really should see this in a theater bigger than life. The dragon is excellent the ugly vs the beautiful is wild the sequencing is uneven though at the end it takes you on a great ride. Oh and for you people that want to go see Angela Jolie nekkid? IT'S CGI!!! I've seen harder stuff on Fox networks! Seeing my wife and I saw this as a matine the crowd was on the sparse side and there was literally no kids present. I couldn't get a solid feeling from the audience though most people as they left seemed genuinely happy with their experience. I'm sure it was PG13'd because of the sequences with Angela otherwise it would be a solid PG. I wouldn't suggest this for a kid under 8.".

The only downside for me was some of the CGI. It seemed apparent that given an unlimited budget this movie would have looked phenomenal in every scene but unfortunately the budget wasn't unlimited and it shows in a number of places. Nothing looks horrible but you can tell that they had to pick and choose where to go for high detail. The movie also suffers from the age old it's creepy because it's almost perfect.As for the 3D apart from an awesome intro nothing seems to be done just to exploit 3D it's all very natural and adds an amazing level of detail to the movie. The depth of vision you get is truly breathtaking in parts.Quite honestly I wasn't expecting much from this movie having seen the trailer but I was blown away.

	schema:reviewBody "Pretty much everyone knows the story of Beowulf  man fights monster monster's mum and then a dragon  but this ancient story has inspired generations of writers and academics now it gets a shiny makeover courtesy of Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary.Beowulf the man could have been written as a cookiecutter hero but fortunately he's something else  fallible and not yet the hero he must become later in the movie. But and this is really hard without spoiling the movie the battle that turns him into a hero also leads inexorably to his undoing. That's something the two writers have brought to the millennia old text and it works perfectly to help fill in some of the gaps in the original poem and provide a back story to events. A special mention also to Crispin Glover's Grendel. I wasn't particularly struck with the physical realisation of the monster but the performance is knock out. Instead of just being a rampaging beast Grendel is almost something to be pitied  a misshapen outcast with noisy neighbours and his final scene is remarkably touching. Oh and if you don't understand Grendel you clearly haven't been keeping up with your Old English classes!But let's be honest everyone watches a movie about Vikings for the action. And Beowulf delivers this in spades. Here comes my first proviso  Beowulf in the UK is getting a 12A rating but there is no way I would take a 12 year old to see this film in all its eyeball spearing spinesnapping ligamenttearing glory. This movie would get a higher rating had it been shot in reallife and it's worth considering this before packing the kids into the car. Mostly the violence is justified but it is there and it's NOT cartoony.The animation is the talking point of this movie and its a real step on from the zombified performance of 'Polar Express'. The impression of living breathing flesh is almost complete with the exception of strangely dead eyes  this movie is a landmark in computer imagery. The majority of the characters are stunningly rendered Beowulf in particular in close up but they somehow look less convincing at a distance. Generally the men are better done than the women with Queen Wealthow the spitting image of Julie Andrew's queen in Shrek 2.So its a violent special effects triumph  could anything be wrong?Actually yes.Two things. One  the accents. Oh dear god in heaven above what were they thinking  this is a treasure house of appalling voices Irishish Scottishish Welshish are all thrown into the mix but the standout horrors are Jon Malkovich's take on Danish which might have been inspired by the Muppets and Angelina Jolie dusting off her accent from 'Alexander'. The second is the 3D projection. For reasons best known to studio executives we're all meant to get very excited by 3D all over again. Beowulf is one of the first movies to be released in the UK using REALD  a system familiar to anyone who has been to a Disney park in the last 20 years. The animators of Beowulf clearly had great fun working out new ways of making things jump out of the screen at the audience but the effect becomes slightly wearisome after a minute or two. Fortunately things settle down later in the movie and the makers stop trying to show off their new technology. More disappointing the poor quality of the Polaroid glasses you have to wear make the image slightly blurry and spoilt by reflections. After years waiting for the crystal clarity of digital projection the whole thing has been undone by a gimmick. If you have a choice you might be better off seeing a regular 2D version.A final comment Beowulf spends part of the movie naked bet you can't watch it and not think of Austin Powers.".

The hero Beowulf one can't speak of actors or characters in this film is modeled on the Gladiator but lacks his character the monster is a crossbreed of Ent and skinned Gollum the jokes are laconic example How is your father?

In these moments one gets an inkling of what might have been done with this script. Even the final fight with the dragon is impressive. But why does the dragon have a heart small as a cow's? Why does the coastguard sit in front of his fire in the pouring rain? And why does the final unbearably long shot have to be so unbearably kitsch? Shame really.

	schema:headline " Chasing the Dragon";
	schema:reviewBody "The following is a review of the digital 3D version showing at select theaters Robert Zemeckis has always been a trailblazer with film technology. He was among the first to utilize CGI in Death Becomes Her and with his adaptation of the oldest surviving epic poem in the English language he perfects the lifelike digital computer animation he first experimented with in The Polar Express. Like his canon of films over the years Beowulf is an eyepopping mixed bag of cinematic tricks.The animation has come to a point where it is eerily lifelike. In Beowulf every blade of grass every tree branch and every strand of hair has been painstakingly detailed. And while it is hard to tell the difference between the digital Angelina Jolie and the real Angelina Jolie there's still something about the human face the nuances of the muscular features the emotion running beneath that this technology will never capture. It still depicts hollow cold clones of real human beings that could never fully replace 3D flesh and blood.What makes Beowulf so entertaining is the digital 3D technology. It creates some breathtaking vistas where you feel as if the landscapes are moving through you. In some of the more horrific scenes with Grendel you'll find yourself jumping out of your skin. Zemeckis is like a magician with this technology. He's able to bleed something out of nothing by knowing how to get the reactions he wants from his audience with just the right sound effect camera angle and quickcut to complete his trick. It's often ugly but quite breathtaking.Zemeckis loses some ground when he relies too much on juvenile machismo grandstanding to further character development. Sure I love a good death by chandelier scene or a man getting ripped in half by a monster bit as much as the next guy but all the bawdy humor wears thin. Even lamer was the scene where Beowulf fights Grendel in the buff which contained almost as many laugh inducing sight gags as the scene where Bart skateboarded nude through Springfield in this summer's The Simpsons Movie. The mixed bag of tricks and sometimes slow buildup however eventually lead to a totally thrilling finale where Beowulf does battle with the dragon his misdeeds begot. In 3D it's nerveshattering fun. As an action adventure film it makes the mark.Ultimately you realize why this story has survived over 1200 years. Beowulf makes legendary the idea of a hero's fallibility and the global consequences of the sins of the father.

	onyx:emotionText "The following is a review of the digital 3D version showing at select theaters Robert Zemeckis has always been a trailblazer with film technology. He was among the first to utilize CGI in Death Becomes Her and with his adaptation of the oldest surviving epic poem in the English language he perfects the lifelike digital computer animation he first experimented with in The Polar Express. Like his canon of films over the years Beowulf is an eyepopping mixed bag of cinematic tricks.The animation has come to a point where it is eerily lifelike. In Beowulf every blade of grass every tree branch and every strand of hair has been painstakingly detailed. And while it is hard to tell the difference between the digital Angelina Jolie and the real Angelina Jolie there's still something about the human face the nuances of the muscular features the emotion running beneath that this technology will never capture. It still depicts hollow cold clones of real human beings that could never fully replace 3D flesh and blood.What makes Beowulf so entertaining is the digital 3D technology. It creates some breathtaking vistas where you feel as if the landscapes are moving through you. In some of the more horrific scenes with Grendel you'll find yourself jumping out of your skin. Zemeckis is like a magician with this technology. He's able to bleed something out of nothing by knowing how to get the reactions he wants from his audience with just the right sound effect camera angle and quickcut to complete his trick. It's often ugly but quite breathtaking.Zemeckis loses some ground when he relies too much on juvenile machismo grandstanding to further character development. Sure I love a good death by chandelier scene or a man getting ripped in half by a monster bit as much as the next guy but all the bawdy humor wears thin. Even lamer was the scene where Beowulf fights Grendel in the buff which contained almost as many laugh inducing sight gags as the scene where Bart skateboarded nude through Springfield in this summer's The Simpsons Movie. The mixed bag of tricks and sometimes slow buildup however eventually lead to a totally thrilling finale where Beowulf does battle with the dragon his misdeeds begot. In 3D it's nerveshattering fun. As an action adventure film it makes the mark.Ultimately you realize why this story has survived over 1200 years. Beowulf makes legendary the idea of a hero's fallibility and the global consequences of the sins of the father. These are universal themes that have been sung again and again in everything from Shakespeare to this year's best film Before the Devil Knows You're Dead. While the technology used to make this film may seem dated in a few years the story will live on and this just may be the definitive Beowulf for high school English teachers to use in their lame attempts to connect with their students.

Beowulf the great epic is full of magnificent epic poem richly enhanced with kennings and alliteration that bring power and dignity to all of the characters. There was no dignity here. Instead Beowulf was enveloped in shame and given this script it was unintentionally the only thing they got right. Please peopleREAD THE BOOK! The only thing this movie had in common with Beowulf were the names of the characters. Say no to bastard children naked mommies of monsters and lips that do not match up with the dialog.

	schema:reviewBody "It seems we have a new cinematic fad coming into fashion... the genre of mythological action. It began with '300' a film I really enjoyed and the first that stands to benefit from 300's success is Beowulf. Beowulf is the newest film from Robert Zemeckis. Zemeckis implements many of the same visual themes of his last project the heart warming Polar Express with varied success.Beowulf tells the story of the kingdom of King Hrothgar a delightfully campy Anthony Hopkinswhich is currently being terrorized by a monster named Grendel Crispin Glover. Help comes in the form of mighty Beowulf Ray Winstone who arrives with an army of 14 men and his right hand man Wiglaf Brendan Gleeson. It his his job to slay the monster. However he must also deal with Grendel's mother Angelina Jolie. Beowulf is opposed by Unferth John Malkovich and has also been paying close attention to the king's wife Wealthow Robin Wright Penn.Perhaps the most surprising element of the film is its sly wink and a nod sense of humor. This can be viewed two ways. The first view is one of enjoyment and laughter. However it is hard to comply when we are asked to feel or identify with these characters after so many scenes presenting them as mere caricatures.As expected Beowulf is visually stunning. I'd argue it is the one category where this film bests 'Polar Express'. The 3D photography is shockingly good. It is a film I wouldn't want to imagine in the traditional two dimension format. I strongly advise anyone who is going to see this to view the film in 3D. Without it the film would be borderline un enjoyable. The highlight is by far the final battle scenewhich just begs you to forget the film's past misdeeds. Close but no dice.".

	schema:reviewBody "Short answer If you love the old AngloSaxon poem Beowulf do not see this movie. You will be nauseated.Longer answer In the Dungeons and Dragons community there is an old joke that the characters kill things and take their stuff. Well Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary managed to kill Beowulf and take his stuff. Then they proceeded to kill Hrothgar the helm of the Shieldings and take his stuff. Then they killed Grendel and took its stuff. Then they killed Wealtheow and took her stuff. And so on and so forth. These two imbeciles with Underwoods an orangutan could have come up with a more sensitive treatment of one of the seminal pieces of English literature! completely changed the tone of the poem from a serious heroic epic to just another postmodern round of no more heroes buffoonery.The literary atrocities of Messers Gaiman and Avary upon the source material are as follows 1. The poem has been dechristianized On the one hand it does take out a glaring anachronism the action of the poem takes place during the Migration Period of the AD 400s500s when they would still be following the traditions of the Aesir religion but the poem was written down in a very Christianized context in England and the anachronism does add a richness to the language The only sop to the underpinnings of the source material come in a discussion between two urinating Danes over the relative merits of Christianity and Aesirworship and later when Unferth suggests praying to Christ as well as Odin a suggestion that Hrothgar rejects out of hand perhaps a reference to the opposite situation in the poem where the Danes throw off Christianity for a time hoping that the old gods will smite Grendel where the Christian ones had apparently failed.2. It is implied very heavily that Beowulf was a liar and braggart in his earlier exploits including the race with Breca As with many of the other changes it seems to be part of a deliberate campaign by Gaiman and Avary to strip away the heroic nature of the source material turning Beowulf into just another trendy 21stcentury flawed antihero.3. The characters often speak with a much more modern speech pattern see for instance Unferth's first confrontation with Beowulf where he comes off as much more smarmy than in the poem that is jarring to the ear and that often seems to lead yet again into Gaiman and Avary's unspoken goal of deheroizing demythologizing and debunking the poem.4. Beowulf does not kill Grendel's Mother In the poem it's reported as fact that Beowulf kills her after a ferocious struggle. Nowhere in the poem does it suggest that she seduces him and he lies about killing her. Again it's the old song of everything you know is false  there are no true heroes. 5. Beowulf fighting in the nude Beowulf does forswear the use of arms in fighting Grendel but nowhere does it say that he would fight the monster in the alltogether tackleout with only strategicallyplaced objects protecting his modesty. In fighting with Grendel's Mother it is explicitly stated that he is wearing chainmail armor and that that saves his life. I'm giving a pass to her appearance as it's never stated exactly what either she or Grendel actually were supposed to look like.6. Hrothgar is almost explicitly stated to be Grendel's father No no NO! Nowhere in the poem was any mention of Grendel's father made least of all it being Hrothgar whom Grendel's Mother would not have been able to have known anyway as he was a consecrated king and it is implied that Cain's kin could not go near signs of rightful royalty. Cain the first murderer who is claimed to be the ancestor of Grendel's kind not Cain the notappearinginthepoem whipping boy of Unferth's that is. 7. Hrothgar and Wealtheow have no issue because Wealtheow will not sleep with Hrothgar due to his sleeping with Grendel's Mother and the subsequent romantic subtext between her and Beowulf Wrong again. Leaving behind the fact that Wealtheow probably was not as nubile in the poem as in the movie and showed no romantic interest in Beowulf whatsoever she and Hrothgar had two sons and as mentioned before Hrothgar had not slept with Grendel's Mother.8. Hrothgar gives his kingdom over to Beowulf and then commits suicide by jumping off the tower of Heorot At this point I walked out of the theater and demanded my money back as the movie had officially jumped the shark with no hopes of return.In short the movie was little more than a parody a lampoon on a great epic.".

	schema:reviewBody "Beowulf is among the greatest and most wellknown epic tales of Norse Mythology but it only took me five minutes into the movie to realize that this film was not even close to as something grand. Why? To my surprise and disappointment this movie was animated. Sure animation isn't a big deal for a film along the lines of Shrek or Ratatouille but not for a story like Beowulf. Beowulf is a very serious tale that covers many topics such as vengeance and forgiveness cruelty and mercy curses and revelations. I admit this movie has some of those aspects but it rather focuses on a corny stylish animation work.The action and animation itself reminded me of a teenrated video game rather than a masterwork. However there were a couple of scenes in the movie of which some of the up closes of the actor's face in certain scenes look real rather than animated particularly in the scene of where Beowulf encounters Grendel's mother. I don't know if this was digitized or not but either way I felt like I was brought back to a normal film in these scenes versus a silly cartoon.As with the story rather than beginning with King Hrothgar murdering Grendel's father it opens with the King having a party of drunkenness and very inappropriate nudity particularly for an animation film. Then the party is suddenly raided by the giant Grendel. After this raid which is quite bloody especially for an animated film and long ends Beowulf is finally introduced.Now the movie does not explain why Grendel keeps attacking Hrothgar. In the myth it was because he was responsible for Grendel's father's death. There is no sign or even an implication of this. As for Grendel well all I can say is he looks like a giant mummy from The Mummy Returns and loves to yell at the top of his lungs. I felt no pain for him rather an urge to say Shut your gull! I don't want to even bother in trying to explain the rest of the story. It is mainly a combination of Beowulf's two great tales smashed together in under a two hour film.Since the story wasn't really developed well the actors did not have much breathing room to really act. The monsters were evil and the good guys were heroes. Ray Winstone as Beowulf is pretty much like Gerard Butler was as King Leonardis from 300. He has a musclebound figure loves to kill things occasionally tries to be civil in politics loves to walk around butt naked and shout drunkenly I am Beowulf! I can't help but think of This is SPARTA! Anthony Hopkins as great an actor as he is is an old senile drunken fool who can't stride from one chair to the next. Angelina Jolie well she's Angelina Jolie. She has a great body and speaks smoothly with her accent from Alexander. There's nothing worthwhile in this film just a wasted epic that relies too much on the CGI department and has vivid images of sex and violence. I'm even more surprised that the great director Robert Zemechis of Back to the Future and Forrest Gump would direct this garbage.110 I wish I can get my money back.".

Beowulf was supposed to pull of Grendel's arm not shut it in a door. Grendel's mother was supposed to have lived in a lake of fire and be an ugly hag. Beowulf was also supposed to kill her not make a dragon child with her. Grendel's mother was only supposed to kill one man when she comes to Herot not all of Beowulf's men. And Hrothgar never gave Beowulf his kingdom. Beowulf had his own.

Beowulf was supposed to pull of Grendel's arm not shut it in a door. Grendel's mother was supposed to have lived in a lake of fire and be an ugly hag. Beowulf was also supposed to kill her not make a dragon child with her. Grendel's mother was only supposed to kill one man when she comes to Herot not all of Beowulf's men. And Hrothgar never gave Beowulf his kingdom. Beowulf had his own. Beowulf after a long unsuccessful battle with the dragon was supposed to have died not having killed the dragon and Wiglaf ended up defeating it.

	schema:headline " Don't waste your money on the 2D version this has 3D written all over it!";
	schema:reviewBody "I have never had the experience of seeing a 3D movie before on the cinema the only experience I have had with a 3d film only courtesy of some 3d glasses coming free with a DVD was Spy Kids 3D a movie while mildly entertaining isn't exactly the best film every to display the greatness of 3d. So Beowulf today was my first 3d experience I went in expecting something good because of the 3d but I didn't expect the movie itself to be superb. Part of my reasoning behind this was because of the one and only experience I had had with Zemeckis and his new way of making movies. That movie was unfortunately the Polar Express a supposedly happy tail that actually freaked me out more than most horror movies! So what an absolute delight to say that Beowulf not only works because of it being in 3D more on that brilliant factor later but also the movie is a genuinely brilliant movie anyway. The motion capture isn't remotely creepy this time round and actually it seemed to make sense in some bizarre way as to why they did the movie like this. The actors surprised me big time Ray Winstone delivering actually one of his best performances in a long while Angelina Jolie playing the slinky seductress to perfection and Anthony Hopkins being a joy to watch on screen. Beowulf is an action packed well written and entertaining piece of popcorn cinema. Just watch the dragon sequence near the end every single person in my cinema was on the edges of their seat and looked in awe. The action sequences just amaze and the dialogue sequences surprisingly really work as well. Unfortunately however if you see this movie in 2D then you will not be experiencing Beowulf in my eyes take off the 3D this is a 910 movie with the 3D it gets the 1010 rating with a blink of an eye.As I've previously said the acting in the movie really caught me off guard. Ray Winston obviously is not the first actor who comes to mind when playing an ancient warrior. However when you see the movie and see the performance you understand why Winstone was cast. Sure his cockney acting at first seems a bit bizarre coming from the character but after a while you see the subtlety of the performance and come the final half hour you realise he's quite possibly the best thing in the movie. He delivers a heartfelt and genuinely brilliant performance. Anthony Hopkins not only looks real in the movie but he too delivers a performance truly worthy of Anthony Hopkins. Sometimes Hopkins can do a role for a sake of a role see Mission Impossible 2 but here he seems to be having a blast as Hrothgar and he has some superb moments in the movie. Angelina Jolie plays the most interesting character of the movie Grendell's Mother alas she appears very briefly. But her few scenes stick firmly in memory and her entry scene is one of the most beautifully pieces of cinema I have seen when watched in 3D. Crispin Glover too has brief screen time as Grendell but he delivers a heartfelt performance in fact I felt genuine sympathy with Grendell. Glover might not be recognisable but his performance shines through in the early scenes. John Malkovich and Robin Wright Penn too deserve considerably praise as does a brilliant cast Brendan Gleeson.So as I've said the 3D really makes the movie have a cherry on top of an already beautiful cake. After they filmmaker get over the gimmick of chucking things at the screen the 3D is used less prominently until any action sequences and when the action sequences begin I doubt you will draw a single breath. Grendell's attack on a beer hall is the opening action sequence and it is surprisingly violent for a 12a and also amazing to behold. But its the dragon sequence and late battle sequence that stick firmly in mind. I shall not spoil them but those sequences really did make me wish that every action movie ever made from now will be in 3D. The problem with the 3D being so good is that the 2D version seems like a cash in in fact the movie relies so much on the 3D at times that I doubt the 2D version is worth watching. Swords pointed at screens the camera pans through trees the multi layered effect it gives off in 2d it just won't work as well so my advice is to find a cinema that does play it in 3d you'll get much more for your money if you do. The storyline and film making is also extremely effective. The subtle dialogue scenes especially the stuff between Winstone and Jolie really are some of the highlights. Also the relationship between Beowulf and his queen is touching.So are their any faults? As I've mentioned the 2D version just won't be as good but also the movie doesn't seem like it'll be that good at the start. In fact at the beginning for five minutes I was expecting to be bitterly disappointed. Thankfully that little slouch at the beginning is livened up with the arrival of Grendell and from that point onwards you will adore the movie. This is Zemeckis' best movie since Back to the Future and definitely one of my favourite films of the year. Go and watch in 3D and pray that more movies will be made like this in the near future.".

He returns to the Geats claiming to have defeated Grendel's mother and is then made king by Hrothgar. This is of course good for Beowulf because he has a thing for Wealtheow Hrothgar's wife anyway. The kind and noble King Hrothgar has also been degraded to a cheating husband who also sleeps with Grendel's mother hence the existence of Grendel and who end up killing himself after making Beowulf king. the only noble deed that Beowulf seems to achieve in the movie is by severing his own arm from his body and by tearing out the dragon's heart with his bare hand neither of which is in the book by the way. Funny in the book I don't remember the fight with the dragon leaving the cave at all...We can only pray that someday someone does this epic justice and makes a decent film out of it.

This although a shock to some I'm sure means little to the vast majority of viewers who either 1  never heard of this legendary hero in the first place or 2  would forever picture him as Christopher Lambert in the eponymous and eminently forgettable straighttoDVD movie of some years ago. The truth is this movie is a spectacle to behold it grips you from the first scene wrings you by the seat of your pants and absolutely knocks your socks off at every corner  at least CGI wise. It has its faults surely as any masterpiece but a masterpiece it still is. Some set pieces are not as well rendered as others the water in the ocean is a blatant example but others are just plain outstanding and technologydefying like the last battle of the movie which I won't reveal here. Ray Winstone Beowulf is tremendously convincing as is the generally underrated Crispin Glover Grendel  who go figure is no dragon as other people said  Sir Anthony Hopkins is very much royalty in his own right King Hrothgar and Robin Right Penn Brendan Gleeson and John Malkovich excel in the little nuances that give supporting role characters their chances at the Oscars  unfortunately Angelina Jolie's part is both a visual treat and at the same time an auditory shame  very few lines are spoken  it seems seeing her with zero garments was understood to be enough to satisfy the teenage crowds  well I would certainly have liked for more character development but what the hell can't really complain. As far as anthropomorphic CGI goes all the main characters are instantly recognizable but not perfect this is still an evolution over Zemecky's own The Polar Express mind you and no matter how much the 3D effects try and try they do believe you me they still seem like gimmicks  the first part of the movie and the cave scenes encompass the best 3D trickery on display  and this new fangled technology is truly superior to the previous redblue glasses of yesteryear  and will probably leave you with a little less of a hangover afterward. When all is said and done it stands out on its own merits epic comes to mind and so does cutting edge. This is a movie that will sell a lot of HD hardware be it BluRay or HDDVD or whatever else just comes out meanwhile and sure to be displayed in plasmas and LCD screens all over the world when this movie goes on sale. Go see it now at theaters in its original digital form 3D glasses over your nose and enjoy it for what it is pure magic.".

Thus I won't talk about the awful and treacherous rendition but more of the failings of the movie as a story separate of its source.The main thing that was inconceivable for me was the socalled hero Beowulf hailed by many of his entourage during the movie as a savior as a luminous figure with glorious achievements and high courage is in my eyes as portrayed in the movie again I repeat a braggart a liar and a cheater since there is a difference between the two a powergrabbing sellout and a lecherous Don Juan in the worst sense of the word no flashbacks to longsuffering Johnny Depp please they're in different classes. I have so resented the mockery made of this supposed hero that I felt nothing but relief at the end of movie and was left completely cold by his death. I think I felt more about Grendel's death such a pitiful creature. Now I assume this isn't the reaction sought by the filmmakers but this is what they got from me and I'm not the only one who left the theatre with an acute sense of disbelief.The women well what to say about them in every scene they were present they were seen as objects of sexual desire or were involved in romantic flirt and moreover they seemed to revel in it the aging Beowulf's young flame was absolutely sickening in her haste to be approved by the then king. Not one remote moment where they were more than just acting womanly the men around. Not even Angelina Jolie I would have expected a knife through the heart for her child's murderer not a roll in the hay well mud from cave to be exact. Sir Anthony Hopkins the amount of respect I have for the man risked by the filmmakers through a risqu and needless unveiling of flesh in a drunkard romp which I bet they thought it would be funny. And also poor poor lines that even his talent couldn't save. I hope to see him in a new movie quite soon to drive the bitterness away. I echo the sentiment for John Malkovitch whose ambiguous confusing character traits didn't allow him to truly expand.Other things to nitpick at the allusions to Christianity seemed out of place most of the time as I didn't understand what they could contribute to the plot maybe atmosphere the gory scenes that might look great on 3D but just left me nauseated a tipless is sometimes more but not when involving Beowulf's striptease nudity I thought it was real cold up North but go figure. The last thing that topped it off and sent me in front of my computer was Wiglaf's last scene where they finished it in true horror movie style with the continuity of the evil character that will come back for revenge. It's not the sequelwanting that troubles me but what it implies of humankind this man has been the witness of not one but two falls caused by the same mistake and he's seriously thinking that he should want a repeat of it and get a different result that's the definition of madness. For me that was the last straw for the cheap effect they had forsaken the lesson and its consequences and offer no hope.As for the animation I'm not an expert but the friend I went to the movie with who is one says to tell you the animals weren't veridical the humans' hands looked weird and some often the movements were real awkward though the dragon was awesome.That's it ramble overhope it helps.".

I liked the ground level shots of horses riding by .The bad part is the story which follows the current American trend of showing that the real monsters in all situations are men. Not humans overall of course just men who it seems are all sex crazed drunk loud violent sexist buffoons who impose themselves on long suffering women and monsters everywhere. Yet even these Vikings who sing of rape and pillage meekly listen to the no means no lecture and cry when reminded that they were unfaithful to their wives.They're momma's boys who boast of being bad when out of their playpen as Anthony Hopkins shows in arriving on screen in a diaper. Good momma Robin and bad momma Angelina have their own ways of correcting these naughty little boys. Grendel being less of a monster than the men gets lullabies from momma Angelina while the rest of the men get impalement evisceration beheadings and other gruesome deaths.Good momma Robin is kinder in that she only withholds sex and love from both of her husbands ensuring a long unfulfilling marriage to all parties.This clearly has nothing to do with the poem or 6th century Denmark or heroic literature which this genre finds disgusting. It's really about Hollywood in the 21st century and the self centered politically correct intolerance of other cultures and times seen through those who lived in it.Excalibur by John Boorman is a much better envisioning of a heroic story while the Thirteenth Warrior is Michael Crichton's innovative take on Beowulf.".

Yet even these Vikings who sing of rape and pillage meekly listen to the no means no lecture and cry when reminded that they were unfaithful to their wives.They're momma's boys who boast of being bad when out of their playpen as Anthony Hopkins shows in arriving on screen in a diaper. Good momma Robin and bad momma Angelina have their own ways of correcting these naughty little boys. Grendel being less of a monster than the men gets lullabies from momma Angelina while the rest of the men get impalement evisceration beheadings and other gruesome deaths.Good momma Robin is kinder in that she only withholds sex and love from both of her husbands ensuring a long unfulfilling marriage to all parties.This clearly has nothing to do with the poem or 6th century Denmark or heroic literature which this genre finds disgusting. It's really about Hollywood in the 21st century and the self centered politically correct intolerance of other cultures and times seen through those who lived in it.Excalibur by John Boorman is a much better envisioning of a heroic story while the Thirteenth Warrior is Michael Crichton's innovative take on Beowulf.";

I found certain aspects of the film appealing at the core of the film is a psychological and moral allegory about kingship in a warrior culture committed to offensive warfare for the sake of treasure hence the role of Grendel's mother. As such I don't mind the plot changes from the original poem which in the end also simultaneously celebrates and critiques the Teutonic warrior ethos.What did bother me and what almost sent me running from the theater a few times was the emphasis on the gaudy and garish visual effects not to mention the overdone soundtrack. The depiction of Grendel as an anguished pathetic simpleton upset by the noise coming from Heorot is far less effective than the original poem's presentation of him as a mysterious undescribed evil descended from Cain. Having a completely disrobed Beowulf fight Grendel led to gratuitous comedy one was always wondering how are they going to cover it next? that detracted force from what should have been one of the more tense scenes in the film.The graphic novel look which was successful in Sin City and 300 struck me as less effective here perhaps because it is no longer fresh but now formula. And while some of the 3D effects were noteworthy the long shot to the ship across the beach early in the film I thought was pretty neat the technology hasn't advanced much since Invaders from Mars so there's often an obvious artificiality to it that I thought detracted more than it added.Perhaps the words formulaic and artificial best sum up my experience of this film along with loud and garish. It had entertaining moments some of the fight with the dragon I admit got me going but in the end it was all overdone to the point of being indigestible.".

	schema:reviewBody "Beowulf has been my personal favorite book ever since I read it. I read it three times now. Every movie I have seen or heard of based off the book was nothing ridiculously bad but you could easily tell why they weren't in theaters and some of them were decent but nothing too exciting.I was really excited last year when I heard that a Beowulf movie was actually going to be released in theaters! So the wait is over and I finally saw the movie...It was nothing like I anticipated it to be. The movie shows Grendel as some sort of monster to be pitied which the book shows him as a heartless demon without mercy. Grendel was more of an annoyance than anything in the movie with his constant whiningyelling and immature babyish personality.Grendel's mother in the movie was mainly an animated Angelina Jolie which again her personality and looks were nothing like the book. The movie shows Grendel's mother and the dragon to be in some sort of league with each other. The dragon was killed years after Beowulf killed Grendel's mother according to the book.So in other words you have a great story but a shtty movie. The CGI animation throughout only made it even worse. The book was not based on Norse mythology which the movie made references to Odin and Ragnarok and such but rather based on beliefs of God. The book was supposedly written by a Christian monk with all these references to God I'm not saying that this entire movie should be based on the book. But I was expecting something similar to that of the 13th Warrior which strongly reminds me of Beowulf every time I watch it. It had a dark feeling throughout was about a culture similar to that of the vikings and was wellwritten. Beowulf promises animation annoying accents annoying yellingscreaming and whining. It felt like watching a child's version of Pathfinder mixed with Shrek. Beowulf is shown as a fallible character and is persuaded into a deal with Grendel's mother. I could go on and on with the mistakes of this film and how much of a disappointment it was.".

	schema:reviewBody "Visually this film is stunning. More than once I had to remind myself that what I was looking at was not real actors caught on film but a CGI interpretation. It's difficult to purvey this feeling as either a negative or a positive one on the one hand I cannot see the point in producing CGI if what the filmmaker's goal is realism of reality. CGI in film is of course appropriate when trying to achieve fantastical creatures and set pieces which are of course inherently unrealistic but in Beowulf each actor's face verbal and nonverbal performance are recreated in CGI verbatim. This I cannot fathom  why recreate what is already there in the flesh and far more believable? On the other hand there is a sense of true wonder when in a handful of scenes you are genuinely fooled into thinking that what you are looking at is not CGI but live action film. You are left with no choice but to marvel at the technical and artistic achievements. However the illusion is inevitably shattered when you begin to pick up on some of the unrealistic lighting dodgy physics and for some reason gesticulation wooden puppets spring to mind. It's really hard to understand what was being attempted with this film genuine realism then why recreate the actors in CGI? complete fantasy immersion then why are some scenes so tangible? or as I suspect purely an exercise in what is possible with modern CGI.The pace of the story itself is about right with a good balance of character development and plot enhancement. Anthony Hopkins puts in a decent performance as Hrothgar and John Malkovich as Unferth is suitably sinister. Ray Winstone is well Ray WYSIWYG Winstone. Angelina Jolie makes a brief and scantilyclad appearance as Grendel's Mother although at times I found it very difficult understanding the dialogue between Grendel Crispin Glover and Grendel's Mother due to some very obscure accents. It's difficult to discredit the physical acting because although it is clear that the original actors did perform physically I suspect that much was lost in the CGI transformation.Unfortunately this movie's biggest flaw is the story itself. I appreciate that when interpreting the written media to film some degree of poetic licence is required but why do so many filmmakers blatantly disregard original source material unnecessarily? Beowulf does present the key protagonists and the first half of the film is fairly accurate but the second half is wildly aloof in its interpretation of the original text.That said overall the film is beautiful and should be applauded for what has been achieved but for the time being you are left feeling that this technique of story telling should be confined to games. Incidentally I felt the same about The Polar Express although that film was aimed at a far less mature audienceor was it?".

In fact I found the CGI characterisation a little offputting because some of the characters were clearly supposed to be based on the actors who supplied the voices but I spent the entire film wondering who they were. In this respect I found the choice of Ray Winston for the lead role of Beowulf particularly incongruous because no matter how much CGI is applied to the process of making a film as soon as I hear that voice what I actually see on the screen isn't a musclebound antihero but a fat cockney Even if Ray Winston were to have a full body transplant which is effectively what this film gives him I'd still see a fat cockney on the screen and I'd spend the entire time wondering where he was hiding or trying to guess who Unferth is only to find  to my disappointment  that it's a particularly crap attempt to render John Malkovich's face.I'd say moreorless the same the 3D element of the film which though a nice bonus I found most effective in the film's quieter moments such as the shot along the pebblebeach with the longboat in the distance. All that flying through the air around and about Grendel failed to impress  if anything it just left me feeling dizzy and a little sick.So what of the adaptation? Well it's terrible of course because Hollywood touched it and Hollywood just can't bear to leave any story untouched by its own mutable standards. To put it bluntly As an adaptation of Beowulf this film is clown shoes. I'd have enjoyed it more and it would have had more artistic integrity if Beowulf had a painted face stickon nose and a fright wig At least it would have been an honest statement of intent.The nearest thing this film has to integrity bearing in mind that Mel Gibson recently felt free enough to release a film entirely in Aramaic is Grendel muttering some of his lines in Anglo Saxon which would be alright were it not for the fact that noone else in the film speaks in Anglo Saxon so the effect of this device it to make it appear as if Grendel is speaking his own monsterlanguage not the same language as everyone else in the epic.In summary then This film is a terrible adaptation with graphics that will look dated by next year and some awful scriptwriting. Well done lads you've penned another hit! Hollywood Ending OTOH if you like Hollywood action movies with a DD twist like Eragon  LotR then this film is for you. You'll spend your 5 you'll laugh gurn and cry your way through the film and come out the other end of the movie sausagemachine feeling replete.And more fool you.".

Also not only is it an extensive and warm exposure of the Napolitan style of life and its very original mentality with great variations but above all a very human approach to this kind of life. Of course it's a triumphant comedy but with dark undertones. The one who spoils the entertainment is Harry Guardian as Jack who doesn't fit in at all can't understand the Napolitan mentality and style of life and seems to deliberately make a bad actor but the story turns logic and he gets his just reward. Senta Berger is something similar but she is closer and more familiar with the Italian style she fits in even as the rather cheap slut she is under all her elegance but also she gets her just reward. They all do and that's the wonder and point of this sparkling film which gets better all the time as the plot thickens in constantly wrong directions. In brief it's classical hilarious entertainment with some very wise indications by the finger of both fortune and fate. You get disgusted by the torpid enterprise but you learn something on the way and end up the wiser from this awesome experience of not only laughters on the way.Of course if you are Italian or understand Italian and even the Napolitan dialect the film will be doubly entertaining because if you don't you will not understand everything since much is untranslatable.".

Once they get the blessing of the local boss Don Vincenzo Toto they approach local talent for assistance with the job  starting with a thief named Dudu Nino Manfredi. Planning hits a snag however when Dudu learns of the intended target. He cannot possibly steal from the Cathedral of San Gennaro. In the end Dudu relents but that's only the beginning of the problems for the group. Can they overcome the many obstacles in their way and who will try to cheat who out of the treasure?Overall The Treasure of San Gennaro is a very enjoyable comedyheist film that could have been even better. To begin a lot of the comedy actually works. The scenes at the unexpected wedding scenes with Don Vincenzo and the explosive rat are just a few of the moments that were funny to me. The actual plan to steal the treasure is of course overly complicated and fraught with possible things that could go wrong. You just know it's all going to fall apart. I love these kinds of intricate plans. The final scene is also quite good and appropriate as the treasure comes full circle and ends where it should. Finally the cast was enjoyable  particularly Toto Manfredi Mario Adorf and Senta Berger. It's a nice cast.Even though I've rated The Treasure of San Gennaro a 710 it's not without a couple of big faults. Chief among them is what I thought was an overly long script. A few judicious edits could have made this movie so much better. I would have preferred a 90 minute runtime to the 104 minute runtime.Finally as much as I enjoyed this movie it's not the best Italian comedyheist film I've seen. If you're into this kind of movie be sure to check out Big Deal on Madonna Street. It's one remarkable movie!".

	schema:reviewBody "As a fan of Legally Blonde 2 Red White and Blonde's predecessor I avoided watching this sequel until today and for good reason it seems. The rumours and reviews are true. This is an awful sequel to what was an otherwise clever and cute movie that recognised it's flaws but made light of them. This movie fails to do that and instead ends up becoming what the first film tried to avoid a shallow story following the unbelievable events of a caricature of a character. People who have not watched Legally Blonde 1 will not be aware of this contrast and so might view this movie differently which seems to explain why the majority of good reviews here come from these exact same people. LB2 follows Elle Woods Reese Withersproon a Harvard Law graduate who is fired from her position in a prestigious Law Firm for trying to champion animal rights after discovering that her dog Bruiser's mother is being used as a test subject in a cosmetics company. In order to have her dog's mum attend her wedding to Emmett Luke Wilson she heads to Washington D.C and joins the team of Congresswoman Victoria Rudd Sally Field to learn the ins and outs of Washington politics and to pass her 'Bruisers Bill' through congress that would see an end to the legal status of animal testing. This movie just utterly fails to capture the audience's hearts with it's preachy message lacklustre humour and unrelatable characters who we once used to love. Gone is the Elle Woods who learned to overcome prejudice and grew into a strongwilled selfassured smart woman. Instead Elle is a vapid loudmouthed airhead who still lets people's impressions of her get her down. I thought that she would be a seasoned pro when it came to this now but apparently she only learned how to overcome bad remarks within the University framework and nowhere beyond that. The character of Elle is a shadow of her former glory and loses that 'heart' that she had in the first film. Now all she cares about is getting a dog to attend her wedding? And this is important how? When she first trawls into the investigators office with a proposition to find her I was honestly left scratching my head wondering why?. But no. The whole film centres on her apparently gay dog Bruiser and his mum. While the idea of enrolling at university to reclaim a lost love seems unbelievable in itself the way they executed her motives in the first film made it seem so. This time round it's just too far. Some characters from the first movie make an appearance Emmett who didn't even need to be in this film as he is just useless here and her beautician friend who took a downgrade from ditsy to nearly mentally defunct for whatever reason. All of them lose their appeal and whatever relatability they had.I could have suffered through this movie if it even tried to be clever and funny but instead all we get is shallow cheap jokes and dog humour. Oh and cheer leading in front of congress. I'm serious. I felt insulted by watching this and almost guilty that I was a fan of LB1. Was this really the character I loved and thought was endearing from the first installment? Oh my what a fool I was. The script is severely lacking in originality and cleverness the overall message is unnecessarily preachy and vapid and the characters are lame. A lot of wasted opportunities with a good cast including Sally Fields and Bob Newhart.I wish I had never watched this sequel because it has now rubbed the shine off the original for me. This is just a sad sad attempt to milk the cash cow and in doing so the creators of this film have milked everything that made the first film good and turned it sour and unpalatable. I'd give this a zero out of 10 if I could.".

It had a funny central idea more than a few solid laughs and a really entertaining lead character.  This sloppy lamely plotted cashin sequel has none of those things.Reese Witherspoon rapidly losing any edginess she used to have is back as Elle Woods the pinkloving fashion conscious lawyer.  She's about to get married to her boyfriend from the last movie played by Luke Wilson and in trying to invite her dog's parents to the wedding that's right her DOG'S PARENTS  remember what I said about the movie being lamely plotted? she finds out that the dog's mother is being held prisoner by a cosmetics company that is proanimal testing.So...Elle decides to go to Washington to take on animal testing.  And I wish I was in a different theater.What we have here is a comedy with no good jokes.  Not a single one.  This movie's idea of comedy is for Elle to find out her chihuahua is gay.  And then in the very next scene the chihuahua is wearing a studded leather vest.  Sigh.Also it's dumb.  That's not necessarily a bad thing but there's a big difference between movies that go about being dumb in a very smart witty way see Charlie's Angels Full Throttle and a movie like Legally Blonde 2 which is just plain dopey.  The story is idiotic characters change their minds and motivations for no reason other than to fit into where the plot is going and everything wraps up in a way that is nauseatingly phony.I've pretty much given up on Reese Witherspoon.  Where is the cool edgy actress that starred in movies like Election Freeway and American Psycho?  Abducted by Hollywood to make useless vanilla movies like this apparently.  I for one would love to see her character from Freeway scare the living s out of Elle Woods.".

She's about to get married to her boyfriend from the last movie played by Luke Wilson and in trying to invite her dog's parents to the wedding that's right her DOG'S PARENTS  remember what I said about the movie being lamely plotted? she finds out that the dog's mother is being held prisoner by a cosmetics company that is proanimal testing.So...Elle decides to go to Washington to take on animal testing.  And I wish I was in a different theater.What we have here is a comedy with no good jokes.  Not a single one.  This movie's idea of comedy is for Elle to find out her chihuahua is gay.  And then in the very next scene the chihuahua is wearing a studded leather vest.  Sigh.Also it's dumb.  That's not necessarily a bad thing but there's a big difference between movies that go about being dumb in a very smart witty way see Charlie's Angels Full Throttle and a movie like Legally Blonde 2 which is just plain dopey.  The story is idiotic characters change their minds and motivations for no reason other than to fit into where the plot is going and everything wraps up in a way that is nauseatingly phony.I've pretty much given up on Reese Witherspoon.  Where is the cool edgy actress that starred in movies like Election Freeway and American Psycho?  Abducted by Hollywood to make useless vanilla movies like this apparently.  I for one would love to see her character from Freeway scare the living s out of Elle Woods.";

	schema:reviewBody "That a film sequel will invariably fail to meet the standards of its predecessor is nearly axiomatic. For every brilliant sequel like 'Aliens' or 'Godfather Part II' there are dozens of painfully lame successors. This is hardly a surprise yet it is our own unerring tendency to flock lemminglike to sequels that insures their continued existence. Sequels make money and that's a bad thing. Take 'Legally Blonde 2'. Please. By way of defense let me point out that it isn't all that easy to find a movie that will entertain two adults a 15 year old boy and a 12 year old girl. Our hopes weren't high when we rented LB2 a couple of weekends ago however we all agreed that we had enjoyed the original movie or at least hadn't actively hated it. That perky little Reese Witherspoon  how can you not kinda like her huh? After seeing LB2 I will unreservedly credit it with one thing it provided a rallying point for my oftenscattered family. We were steadfast united in our complete and utter loathing for this execrable movie. Beyond that questionable achievement however I'm not sure there's anything positive that can be said about this film. As virtually every other reviewer on the planet has noted the original 'Blonde' had some amusing moments most of which were supplied by Ms. Witherspoon who managed to inject the character of Elle Woods with a believable combination of ditziness and sweet charm. Also bolstering the original film was costar Jennifer Coolidge who played her dimbulb shtick to perfection as Elle's beautician friend Paulette. Of course it was a bythenumbers plot line as predictable as Oregon rain but Witherspoon et al played it lightly and for laughs and it worked. The sequel however is an appalling mlange of preachiness offensive stereotypes and patently ludicrous plot devices. 'Legally Blonde' made points by taking a heliumweight bubbleheaded rich girl and making her into a sympathetic character. In LB2 Elle is an annoying dipshit whose breathless naivete and hyperactive adventures are simply painful to endure.There's no real point in enumerating all the faults of this movie. To do so would be to grant it more thought than evidently went into its creation. But I can't simply step away from one aspect of the film that I found both irritating and troubling. Viewers of the first film will no doubt remember Elle's Chihuahua Bruiser. For reasons that are continually validated I tend to hate cutesy cinematic animal sidekicks and Bruiser was emphatically no exception. In LB2 however Bruiser's sexuality becomes a repeated theme and convenient plot device. More specifically we and Elle discover that Bruiser iswait for it gay. Hilarity ensues ad nauseum. It's a damning testimony that 1 the writers of this movie were so desperate for script fodder that they came up with this stunningly lame idea in the first place2 that they play it so shamelessly for laughs and 3 that certain plot twists depend on this fact. It's a stupid stupid idea in a stupid stupid movie. Should I waste more of my time or yours decrying the utter waste of Jennifer Coolidge in this movie? What about Sally Field's humiliating role as Congresswoman Victoria Rudd? Bob Newhart's excruciating turn as the knowitall hotel doorman cum political mentor. Finally on a larger scale should we discuss the massive suspension of disbelief that's required to even slightly believe a moment of this wretched film? Nah.".

	schema:headline " The Most Disappointing Sequel of 2003";
	schema:reviewBody "Legally Blonde 2 Red White and Blonde is a very disappointing sequel as it fails to deliver the laughs. Elle Woods is now a rising young lawyer at a great firm balancing a demanding a career with preparations for her wedding to the man of her dreams. But when she finds out that her beloved dog Bruiser's family members are being used as cosmetic test subjects by one of her firm's own clients she stands up for their rightsand is promptly fired. Ms. Woods decides to go to Washington to take matters into her own hands. The plot actually had some potential unfortunately the execution was very poor. The original wasn't an Oscar quality film it was just a fun film to watch. The sequel isn't as fun nor is it fun in general. It was pretty much the same as the first movie and so it was a pretty pointless sequel. Reese Witherspoon returns and she does a good job but she's working with a weak script. The supporting cast isn't very good as none add much to the film. Sally Field is a very good actress but her talents are wasted. Luke Wilson's character isn't very interesting and Jennifer Coolidge tries to hard most of the time. Regina King is a new addition to the cast and she does an okay job nothing memorable though. Missing from this sequel is Selma Blair this doesn't matter though as her character wasn't really needed. Charles HermanWurmfeld replaces Robert Luketic as the director and does a very bad job. The running time is a brief 95 minutes though it feels a lot longer then that. The film felt a lot longer since the movie just wasn't funny. There were a few funny moments though most of the jokes this film delivered were at best small chuckles. Do a few funny moments redeem this film? No this sequel is one of the worst sequels of 2003 and one of the worst comedies of 2003. In the end this sequel may seem funny but I assure you it isn't. Rating 4.310 rent the original instead.".

She never stays down long always picking herself up with a fresh approach until she achieves her goal. I look at it like a 'Roadrunner' cartoon but with real people. It is silly and implausible but funny. In this case the 'bad guys' are the US Congress in a parody of it's habit of making backroom deals and taking care of supporters to guarantee reelection even if nothing is done to help constituents. Elle Woods finds that animals are used to test cosmetics and her quest is to get a law passed that will make it illegal. Nothing more than cute funny fluff.".

My favorite one is the  tagline on the V.E.R.S.A.C.E. think tank I knew they had one! website that says We test makeup on animals so you don't have to. Anyone who doesn't laugh at that doesn't have any sense of humor or any sense at all.As much as people think this is a silly stupid comedy it has a lot to say. First off even though Elle is into fashion pink her wedding and the like she is smart. She discovers what is going on behind her back. She writes a bill while her coworkers are waiting for lawyers to do it. I don't think that most viewers get that Elle is a smart character not an airheaded one. She is just a free spirit and different.Which leads me to the next layer. In both films Elle is the sore thumb. In a world that worships the thin tan blonde girls she gets into situations where her looks don't work for her. She is put down for what she likes and who she is. She has to show people she isn't the stereotype they think her to be. That gives a good message to teenage girls who would watch the film a much better film night idea than letting them watch Road Trip American Pie or any other pointless teenage sex comedy where the girl is just seen as a sex object and not a real character.  This films has ideas. Elle uses her abilities like making friends to achieve her goals. She never changes who she is deep down for anyone. She is idealistic not cynical or jaded she is friendly and very sweet. More people in the world should be like her.Then there is also the layer of animal rights and fighting for what you believe in even if that means losing your job. Teen based films barely touch politics but this one gives a good look inside what goes on...not intensely realistic but it is a teen movie...one doesn't expect The West Wing here...Not to say that LB2 doesn't have a lot of silly and even stupid humor...I love Paulette and Elle's little dog...but it also has many quick jokes you might not see if you aren't paying close attention.  If you have the DVD pause on the magazines and read them. They are great!  It reminds me of movies like Airplane or Austin Powers the jokes keep coming at you and you have to listen to the dialog closely to get the wit.  It also has some repeating jokes like the intern room reference to Elle and her friends.I actually watched it a second time and laughed louder than the first. It is over the top like a pink sickening sweet cookie with frosting and sprinkles over it...but it works!".

The plot is really silly and unrealistic...but if you can get over that you might enjoy yourself.Reese Witherspoon is once again dynamic as Elle Woods.  She's impossible to dislike and plays her character to the hilt...she doesn't make her too dumb too smart or too sweet...she plays it straight down the middle which works.  Also on hand is Luke Wilson wasted again as Elle's boyfriend and Elle's two hysterically funny best friends from the first movie.  Also it's great to see Bob Newhart and Sally Fields back on screen again Newhart is greatFields is soso.Unfortunately the script has severe problems.  It has some truly funny lines and clever sequencesthe Delta Nus invasion of Washington is worth the price of admissionbut it also has more than its share of unfunny bits and dead spotstoo many of them in fact.  So I seriously can't give it a full recommendationjust a partial one.Best momentsthe aforementioned invasion and a Republican senator who's an NRA spokesman admitting his dog is gayand he loves him for it!".

It was interesting to see a fashionobsessed blonde in pink apparently not fitting in at Harvard law school. They tried the same approach with LB2 only with her walking into congress buildings wearing her all pink outfits. However since we've already seen that attempt at humor in the first movie it just wasn't anything special.Aside from that the plot outline was horrible. Basically Elle Woods Witherspoon is having an upcoming wedding where she plans to invite the mother of her pet dog. She discovers that the dog's mother is in a lab where they were testing fingernail polish on the dog's nails. Elle got sad and was like 'I am going to go to DC and make it illegal for them to test on animals!' The viewer however doesn't really care realizing that putting nail polish on a dog's nails really isn't that big of a deal but hey.I'm not trying to sound mean but I just can't really think of anything good about this movie. Every single joke used in the movie was either not funny or recycled from the first one. The entire concept of the plot is just retarded. It even seemed Reese was halfassing her acting job through the movie doing even worse than she did in the first film. Nobody else in the movie will be nominated for any Oscars either.It just seemed that some filmmaker wanted to cash in from the first movie's success knowing that people will pay money to see this movie just because the first one was popular. All of the production team's effort went into marketing and hype and they just didn't put enough into the actual movie itself.2 out of 10".

Before Spielberg and Lucas came along not a single one of these made movies appealing to the summer blockbuster tradition and unlike Spielberg or Lucas they have a body of work filled in high artistic quality with minimum special effects and a lasting mark on future generations.Polanski is another one of these directors and with Chinatown he reaches his directorial peak amidst the scandals which seemed to taint everything except his art.

Thankfully he lived in a time which did not demand the happy ending or reshoots in order to be politically correct  else Chinatown would have lost its devastating punch and conformed to the norm.A departure from the horror genre which brought Polanski to stardom he recreates an equally grim genre with his jaded view of 1930s Los Angeles down to the choice of the color palette and using the acting powers of Dunaway and Nicholson to a fantastic effect he creates haunting characters who can't be easily dismissed as filmnoir archetypes without looking very closely at their reactions listening to their words and following their progressive involvement in a plot which threatens to swallow them whole and ultimately does. And having Huston play Noah Cross  who virtually took noir to its heights with The Maltese Falcon  Polanski hits the mark dead center because Huston is the hardened heart of the corruption in Chinatown. In brief scenes he creates a character almost unbearably evil with a hint of madness just underneath and how he affects the characters around him will pervade the viewer long after the credits have rolled  after all he is the person who tells Nicholson he has no idea what he's getting himself into.I doubt this movie could be made today for reasons stated above. I'm thankful Polanski's vision prevailed and not Towne's. Filmnoir is a genre about human darkness and here the envelope is pushed all the way through making this film in my opinion rank second to The Maltese Falcon.".

When he is contracted by a Mrs Mulwray to find out if her husband is having an affair he takes to trailing Water Company Executive Hollis Mulwray. Mulwray appears to only have water and a dry riverbed on his mind but eventually they catch him with a young woman although almost immediately the news gets leaked to the papers and Mulwray goes missing only to turn up dead. At this point the real Mrs Mulwray comes to Gittes threatening to sue him for his involvement and Jake realises that he had been set up to set up the Mulwrays. He continues his investigation into the murder only to find a conspiracy involving thousands of gallons of water being wasted during a drought and the mysterious presence of Mrs Mulwray's father Noah Cross.As a fan of film noir and tough detective movies I am too often put off by modern entries into the genre that try to replace atmosphere and intelligence by just having nudity and swearing the genre managed atmosphere without these in the forties and fifties but yet modern films seem to rely on them. With Chinatown however everything works well as a homage to the best years of the genre and as such is very well set in the period and is of suitable presentation even if the material and tone is darker and harder than would have been allowed years ago. This is not to say it is just a copy and paste from better films because it isn't and indeed stands out as one of the best detective noirs I have seen in ages. The plot is always going to be the most important thing and it gets it spot on throughout doing the proper thing of starting with a simple story and continually building it more and more complex as it goes. Unlike some other classics of the genre Chinatown manages to do this without ever losing the audience and I found the plot to be both rewardingly complex but yet still very easy to follow.Needless to say things are very dark and the script is convincingly dark and miserable leading to an ending that is as depressing as I've seen  not so much in what actually happens but also in the wider implications for the characters that the credits prevent us from seeing. Director Polanski does a great job of putting this story in a lush setting that produces a real strong sense of period but also manages to always be showing us the darkness coming through subtly throughout the movie. Of course it helps that he also has a great cast to work with. Jack Nicholson is iconic in this role and if I had to pick one film to act as an introduction to Nicholson then it would be this one. He is tough yet damaged upright but seedy and he brings out his complex character well. Dunaway has less screen time but is just as impressive with a similarly dark role. Huston adds class and manages to ooze menace while also coming across as a harmless old man. The support cast are all fine but really the film belongs to these three with Nicholson being the stand out role.Overall this is a very classy film that has stood up very well to become a welldeserved classic. The story is complex mysterious yet simple to follow it is dark and seedy without relying on swearing or nudity to set the atmosphere. The direction is great with a real atmosphere and sense of time and place that is matched by a great collection of performances delivering a great script.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is a word impossible to spell that describes the alignment of solar bodies like the planets when they all fall into place together. A similar word would describe this film. Everything about it is right. Polanski never directed a better movie. The performers down to the lowest atmosphere person are superb. The editing the score the sound the decor the dialog all are just about flawless. The photography is peerless. The white garden apartments the terra cotta roof tiles the palms and desert sand are all painted with a faint gold faintly ripe with false promise like the oranges that bounce from Gittes' desperately speeding car in the northwest Valley. Polanski deserves much of the credit. When Gittes surprises Evelyn Mulwray in her car after he follows her to her daughter's house her face slumps forward and beeps the horn briefly. Then so faintly we hear a few dogs bark in the background. Not only is the scene itself exquisitely done but it prefigures the ending as does Gittes' remark earlier to Evelyn that she has a flaw in her iris. The movie is too good to deserve much dissecting. It stands repeated watching. If there is anything wrong with it it is the serious and tragic ending that Polanski always insists on tacking on. Robert Towne was right and Polanski wrong in this case. Everything came together on this film. It's not only the best detective movie ever made it's one of the best movies ever made  period. A marvelous job by everyone concerned.I have to add 62705 that the word I mentioned in the first sentence is spelled syzygy. Man did I get enlightening email on that. I might as well add two other impressive features of this movie. 1 Polanksi takes his time. Example Gittes sneaks into Hollis Mulwray's office and begins to go through the drawers of his oldfashioned wooden desk. As he slides each drawer out Polanksi gives us a shot of their humdrum contents checkbooks magnifying glass and so forth and we can almost smell the heat and the odor of shellac and sawdust emanating from the wooden containers. The contents reveal nothing of importance in this case. But 2 sometimes irrelevant information crops up that resonates later in the film with its own echo. The detail might be just a word applecore or an ordinary object a pair of spectacles found in a pond immediately after Gittes imitates the Japanese gardener's remark that the water is bad for the glass. Some of the references may be so consistent as to constitute a theme water. None of this hits you over the head with its significance. It's all very neatly stitched together.".

It stands repeated watching. If there is anything wrong with it it is the serious and tragic ending that Polanski always insists on tacking on. Robert Towne was right and Polanski wrong in this case. Everything came together on this film. It's not only the best detective movie ever made it's one of the best movies ever made  period. A marvelous job by everyone concerned.I have to add 62705 that the word I mentioned in the first sentence is spelled syzygy. Man did I get enlightening email on that. I might as well add two other impressive features of this movie. 1 Polanksi takes his time. Example Gittes sneaks into Hollis Mulwray's office and begins to go through the drawers of his oldfashioned wooden desk. As he slides each drawer out Polanksi gives us a shot of their humdrum contents checkbooks magnifying glass and so forth and we can almost smell the heat and the odor of shellac and sawdust emanating from the wooden containers. The contents reveal nothing of importance in this case. But 2 sometimes irrelevant information crops up that resonates later in the film with its own echo. The detail might be just a word applecore or an ordinary object a pair of spectacles found in a pond immediately after Gittes imitates the Japanese gardener's remark that the water is bad for the glass. Some of the references may be so consistent as to constitute a theme water. None of this hits you over the head with its significance. It's all very neatly stitched together.";

	schema:reviewBody "Chinatown is a tremendous collaborative effort that produced one of the most memorable Hollywood pictures of the 1970's. Director Roman Polanski his last film in America and the first he made in America after the murder of Sharon Tate stars Jack Nicholson  Faye Dunaway and writer Robert Towne all come together to create a detective story classic. At times it slows its pace down so the viewer can think along with Nicholson's character to take in the environment as well as the situation he's in i.e. when he goes to the empty reservoir when he visits Noah Crosses house the first time. And the script has the perfect sense of drawing us into a story fueled by curiosity grit and cynicism and engages the viewer by its realistic dialog between the characters. J.J. Gittes Nicholson in one of his best 70's performances is in Los Angeles circa 1933 in the line of private investigator usually dealing with people who may or may not believe that their significant other is having an affair. Evelyn Mulwray feels this may be the case with her husband Hollis and Gittes decides to take the case. However this draws him into a deeper case involving the city's loss of water once Hollis a major player in the water supply controversy in the city is found murdered. This eventually leads him to Noah Cross John Huston a big businessman and who also happens to be Evelyn's father. Intrigue starts to develop as Jake's own life begins to be at risk. As a intricate detailed detective story the film is an aboveaverage work with Towne's script containing the maturity and wicked sense of humor of a James M. Cain or Raymond Chandler novel. When the thrills come they come as being striking. And when humanity and compassion get thrown into the mix the film reaches a whole other plane of intelligence. The last third of the film could turn off some of the audience depending on one's own level of belief but it holds strong thanks to the performances. Nicholson doesn't overstep his bounds in any scene finding the right notes in suggestive conversations. Dunaway is better than expected though I'm not sure if it's an great performance. And Huston's Noah Cross is one of the more disturbing villains of that period in movies. Add to it some good cameos Burt Young as a driver Polanski playing the little guy in the infamous 'knife' scene and a smooth soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith Chinatown comes out as strong piece of moviemaking and arguably one of the greatest in the crimemystery genre.".

It reminds one of the film noirs that Hollywood used to make during that time period. It is a superb example of film making certainly among the 20 best movies I have ever seen. Jack Nicholson is private detective Jake Gitties who can be as hardboiled as Humphrey Bogart's Phil Marlowe. But Gitties is different He is intelligent dresses well and has associates whom work with him. Gitties is hired by Evelyn Mulwray Faye Dunaway to investigate into an extramartial affair she believes her husband is having. However the investigation leads into bigger things involving the water supply of Los Angeles which is in the middle of a drought. A series of doublecrosses murders and plot twists all lead into a climatic showdown in Chinatown which has a surprising conclusion. If the saying They don't make them like they used to' was ever more true it was with this movie. Sex is only suggested between the Nicholson and Dunaway characters yet it is convincing enough. And although Faye Dunaway is a beautiful woman we never see frontal nudity of her Directors today would do just the opposite. Some of the plot twists also would not be possibly made today especially the ending Which if you haven't seen the movie I cannot reveal. Nicholson is a tour de force in his role as Gitties but the rest of the supporting cast Including John Huston as Mulwray's deceptive father is equally superb. As to how Nicholson could loose the Best Actor Oscar to Art Carney in Harry and Toto is beyond me. Faye Dunaway was also nominated for Best Actress only to loose to Ellen Burstyn for Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore. Fortunately Nicholson and Duanway have both won Oscars since. In addition the film itself received nominations for Best Picture and Best Director for Roman Polanski Who has a cameo in the movie as the knifewelding thug who cuts Nicholson's nose but those Oscars would be lost to The Godfather Part II. The only Oscar won was for Robert Towne's screenplay which is today considered the model for film writing. After watching the movie one will know why. From the stellar performances to the sharp direction to the superb screenplay this is a cinema treasure.".

The plot is like a perfect machine that relentlessly moves towards a final resolution that is truly epic and truly soulwrenching.In a recent New York Times piece they called CHINATOWN a meditation on evil which is spoton. Set in 1937 this movie is just allround perfect first and foremost how everything is connected within the grand structure of the movie that is rich in themes water evil trust guilt greed and even richer in suspense as the audiencejust like our protagonisttries to find out what is happening. The story is complex for sure but it's not complicated. Everything makes sense in the end and the complexity pays off big time.Besides the impeccable screenplay everything else about this movie is perfect as well. Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway carry the movie with sophistication and dignity. Dunaway's stunning performance in particular fills every scene with an aura of mystery as you are trying to find out what her motives are. The set pieces are beautiful the score is compelling and camerawork and editing could not be any better. There is a reason this one is called a classic!

Obviously there are many other great movies and many other movies I personally also love but Chinatown has a real spell over me. Other fans have commented here on the story and the spellbinding way that the forlorn and utterly mysterious story unfolds. I certainly agree. Chinatown's cinematography and editing? Yes I agree again! IMO it's breathtaking with pacing so tight that I sit straight up thru the whole movie and my nerves become completely raw every time I watch listen and FEEL it again. I don't think anybody has commented yet on the great choice of the many supporting actors. Each one so well cast and very believable in their roles! You've got the entire cast credits list thank you IMDb so I won't list them here but there are so many memorable performances here! It would be unfair to highlight one two or three! Good cops bad cops ugly rich upandcoming downtrodden poor the very honest and very crooked with all shades in between! Each and every role a character study in and of itself and together they make a living time capsule of the forties that we can revisit for generations to come.And then there's that sound track which hooked me on great trumpet players and the Est Coast Jazz sound of the era. I just love that music and way it interweaves with the ongoing theme  it's perfectly united with the faithful and compelling use of the filmnoir style.I saw this movie first in Chicago and heck back then I knew nothing about LA though I've since moved to and lived in the area for years. Once relocated I quickly discovered the historically interesting side to the story and then appreciated the movie from yet another compelling angle. No question the plot is fundamentally sound with many totally unexpected and yet quite plausible turns. But I later understood that it's within the realm of believability from factual standpoint as well as intellectuallyemotionally.Geez I'll never forget that first confrontational scene at the Albacore Club! The study in absolute raw and evil power as masterly portrayed by John Huston. In the very same scene Jack Nicholson skillfully paints the subtleties of his cautious cynical smalltime hustler character. The air crackles! I must have played this scene in my mind a thousand times. When I visited Catalina Island for the first time in about 1985 not knowing its significance to the movie I walked by the Albacore Club The Tuna Club in real life and froze transfixed. I recognized it instantly of course and I must have stood there gawking for 20 minutes not saying a word. I could literally HEAR the Chinatown theme  the memories were that clear and fresh!In closing I guess then what does it about Chinatown for me why I feel so strongly that it is the very best movie of all is that every facet of the movie construction from the opening scene to the ending credits somehow fits together in a homogeneous complete and absolutely flawless way. I find it fascinating to analyze the characters and their makeup. To imagine the reasons they did what they did. But there is NOTHING I would change. Nothing.".

	schema:reviewBody "While I don't care too much for Roman Polanski's style of directionmaybe I'll grow to like it eventually maybe not I can't deny that this is a truly great film. Jack Nicholson really shines through in his role and his acting in this film perfectly fits the character... his shark smile his voice his tone... all of it perfect. I always thought when watching films with Nicholson that he'd make a great lead in a noir film so when I found this film and discovered that it was indeed noir I naturally saw it as soon as possible. I found the film to have a slightly slower pace than what I would have preferred or expected but apart from that minor detail it was flawless. The plot is great and thoroughly interesting and involving. The pacing while not fast all the time is more than acceptable. There are sequences that are really intense and exciting. The acting is great... like I said earlier Nicholson shines through and really takes this character and makes him his own. The characters are wellwritten and credible. The special effects are welldone and still hold up pretty well. The dialog is very wellwritten and memorable. There are quite a few quotable lines as well. The cinematography is good and even when the plot doesn't move a lot Polanski keeps our interest through interesting angles and sequences. I liked that there was often something subtle going on in the background while we're focusing on what's directly in front of us. While Polanski certainly doesn't possess the attention to detail that Kubrick does he manages to put a good bit of detail into many of the shots and there is fairly little left to coincidence or chance much like Kubrick. The film has a few twists that are quite good and they come as surprises... I don't think I really saw them coming and I doubt anyone would be able to. Of course some might not find the twists to be that impressive but the story stands on it's own nicely as well. This is a great movie which should be seen by just about anyone who can take itit's more than just casually adult in nature even though there's not that much violence or sex in it. I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys film noir watching Jack Nicholson in perfect shape in a role that was tailormade for him a good mystery Roman Polanski's direction and just a good movie with a more adult tone that many others. 1010".

Jack Nicholson gave one of the best performances of his career and we kept finding out more and more about Faye Dunaway's character eventually knowing shockingly to me why she was both fond and afraid of intimacy. No line in the script is wasted. The cinematography painted a great picture of L.A. reminding me of Collateral and the music score is fantastic as well. It is a real thriller full of mystery kept me guessing all the time but also a real tragedy in a personal level. I feel bad Chinatown had to compete with Godfather II in the same year. It deserves more wins out of its 11 Academy nominations.".

This was certainly a movie of the 1970s with its antihero being the guy we come to root for.Robert Towne is a genius and I may seem to be giving Chinatown loads of fanboy praise but I can honestly say that I'm not obsessed with it in any way in fact I've only seen it a few times. But it's just a really really great movie that's perfect in just about every way  direction acting screen writing cinematography editing sound...the list is endless. Polanski deserves as much praise as Towne I suppose because his direction is flawless and very noirish. If that's a suitable description.Overall this is a classic  for good reason. After seeing this and L.A. Confidential within a few days I can say with confidence that Chinatown is much better and will probably be more fondly remembered years from now.".

While it is said to be a crime thriller meant to keep audiences on their toes with its action and drama which is not really the effect that Chinatown has on the audience. This film actually makes more of a statement on the social and political situations in the United States in this case L.A. If audiences walk into this film expecting a mindless crime thriller then they will be sorely disappointed.In a broad sense this film is about America as a corrupt capitalist society. Jack Nicholson's character J.J Gitte seems to be one of the only characters in the film who sees the water drought in Los Angeles for what it really isthe controlling of a vital source of life for a civilization by the rich and powerful. The rich and powerful owners of capitalism are represented in the film by the character of Noah Cross and most of the members of the Water Department. These men are able to use money and power of influence to reroute the city's water to certain places in order to make themselves even more money. It's a classic case of the rich getting richer by stealing from the poor. J.J sees through this and as a private investigator used to dealing with cheating spouses he gets himself in way over his head while investigating the death of Noah Cross' partner and soninlaw Hollis Mulwray. Hollis it appears was one of the good guys one of the liberal men like J.J wanting to do good. It was his decision to give the ownership of the city's water to the people instead of himself and the corrupt Noah Cross.The characteristics of Noah Cross and J.J Gitte are almost entirely opposite from one another. Also the way that these two men treat women seems to be indicative of the way they treat others. Throughout the film references to J.J's past working in Chinatown seem to be ever present. It comes to our attention that J.J left Chinatown when he tried to save someone from getting hurt but couldn't. It's to be assumed that he tried to help out a woman that he had feelings for failed and that she died. This is exactly what happens to Mrs. Evelyn Cross Mulwray. He falls in love with her or at least lust tries to help her and it ends up turning out exactly as his past Chinatown experience. J.J tries to do good but there are so many powerful situations beyond his control that he simply cannot. Noah Cross on the other hand controls everything. Throughout the film we come across many different people who's actions have been influenced by Cross. It then comes to our attention that Noah Cross raped Evelyn when she was 15 years old that she got pregnant and that the childKatherineis both Evelyn's sister and her daughter. It is no understatement to say that Noah Cross literally controls everything around himincluding his daughter and what to do to her. He seems to embody the epitome of cruel whereas J.J embodies the epitome of nave goodness.Chinatown itself is another symbol present in the film. Chinatown appears to be the place where everything goes wrong for the good guy. There's no law in Chinatown there's nothing to stop the rich and powerful from getting away with whatever they want. It is the end of goodness as is represented by the murder of Evelyn Cross Mulwray by one of the cops. J.J's associate walks up to him as he is staring at Evelyn's dead body in the car and listening to Katherine's screams as she is taken away by her cruel grandfatherfather. The situation is entirely hopeless so all he can think to say to J.J is Forget it Jake it's Chinatown. It's a powerful last moment of the film but it still offers no relief to the audience. We know that J.J won't be able to stop Cross' plans to steal a majority of the city's water to help himself profit during a drought we know that Katherine will be raised by her grandfather and perhaps suffer the same fate with him that Evelyn did and we know that there is no solving the fact that the nation symbolized by Chinatown will never stop being run by the corrupt because the good are powerless to stop it.".

	schema:headline " Polanski's brilliance strikes again";
	schema:reviewBody "Roman Polanski's Chinatown is definitely one of the best crime thrillers when it comes to both its fantastic structure and complex character study. It's his fascinating take on the corruption greed and violence that lead people to become inhumane and brutal towards one another. It's like this real and metaphorical 'Chinatown' in every bigger town in the USA  a place where everything happens on its own rules. Or even better there aren't actually any rules just the law of the jungle one might say. Of course the rule applies as much to a single district as to a whole city or even country.J. J. Gittes has to cope with one of the hardest cases that he had ever encountered. Normally it all comes down to a few pictures of a cheating spouse that's his business all right to end a chapter. But this time it's something much bigger and more dangerous. He embarks on a path which heads toward the discovery of a scheme that concerns the whole city of Los Angeles and its huge water supply. What's more in all this crazy dizzying mess Gittes meets a very fascinating and troubled woman with a difficult mystery attached to herself.After spending time with her Gittes is able to realize how pathological her family really is. And pathology is a right word in this context as the amount of incest and other closely related themes is enormous. The uncontested brilliance that Polanski has shown in Chinatown is contained in its complicated storyline and great use of symbolism connected to every thing watery. Almost everywhere you can sense the impact put on various connotations regarding water not only in dialogues but also in the aspect of sensual experiences. For example tapping water in the sink plays great with the overwhelming silence in the scene where J. J. discovers a dead body on the floor. I really admire Jack Nicholson for his marvelous work in every picture that he stars in but his role in Chinatown is for me the definition of his career. The way he plays Gittes just makes you want more of his onscreen time even though he is the main character. He sometimes shows a very serious side of his nature but he can also come up with a fine amount of great jokes and insults. He is sacrificing his own life to terminate a case which he wasn't even supposed to be involved in. Nicholson shows a bunch of acting skills that make his act very believable and entertaining. Faye Dunaway gives a decent performance as this classy but very disturbed woman trying to help herself cope with the peculiar problems of her strange family. Note Don't miss the very funny cameo by Polanski who plays this scary tiny man with a knife. Many laughs assured!Polanski also makes a great use of the plot device known as a MacGuffin. The murder which occurs in the beginning of the film isn't actually the thing that drives the plot later on. Even though Gittes is trying to find the killer the picture is more about an insight into the characters and their profiles to provide a definitive explanation of this gruesome story.All in all I highly recommend Chinatown as one the best avantgarde crime movies ever directed and one of the finest freshest takes on the pristine noir genre. Great directing thrilling storyline and many detailed puzzles hidden in it account for a most memorable experience.".

From the first shot to the infamous final line you belong to Polanski in his hands for the whole ride  and those hands I think it safe to say are the hands of a master. The film features a phenomenal cast with Jack Nicholson as Jake Gittes the beautiful Faye Dunaway as femme fatale Evelyn Mulwray and the excellent director John Huston in an acting role as one of the most horrifying villains in the history of cinema Noah Cross. Now this is one of those films where little of the plot can be revealed because it's all just far too complicated BUT it's also a film you aren't likely to ever forget. Ever. With beautiful cinematography a heart pounding story line fantastic acting and one of the most atrociously heartrending finales this reviewer has ever seen this film is an absolute must. My rating 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "It's difficult to imagine a more flawless movie than this. A youthful Jack Nicholson is at his very best and most plausible in the role of Jake Gittes featuring in a continuously engaging story which can be appreciated as a timelessly sophisticated tribute and homage to Chandler. Each scene and every moment of the swiftly evolving plot is redolent of intrigue and anticipation. Dunaway and Huston are also superbly cast as are Burt Young Diane Ladd Perry Lopez and the entire list. The acting and direction throughout are uniformly professional and superior. I was particularly struck by the old lady in the retirement home. The script is exceptional and the dialogue totally polished and realistic. There are one or two lines which are directly evocative of Chandler at his best. For anyone with an IQ above moron level even if only slightly it is worth investing a profitable two hours of their life watching this film. It is guaranteed to provide enjoyment and will extend their sensibility and general perception to a very great degree. Audiences expecting a mindless crime thriller will naturally be disappointed as it is highly intelligent though ultimately shockingly tragic. The relationship between personal conflicts and the wider ramifications of civic and corporate crime and corruption is unusually subtle. Chinatown is an area of enigmatic impenetrability which is better left alone. Polanski excels himself. A matter for amazement that this masterpiece languishes as low as 127 on the top 250 list. Some time ago I was discussing movies with a friend's daughter who is married to a man in the film business. After much thought we mutually decided that Chinatown was probably the best film both of us had ever seen. I just watched it again for the umpteenth time. This is a wonderful wonderful film. A clockwork jewel of precision.".

	schema:headline " Prettied up lots of familiar twists but well done surely and with Nicholson in top top form";
	schema:reviewBody "Chinatown 1974Not so much a film noir in style or character but a period crime drama set in the familiar 1930s of many noir films and featuring a noir fixture the loner detective.I say this right away because Chinatown is sometimes called the last great film noir. After this point noir films or pseudonoir whatever your definition become either thoroughly modern or openly derivative. The term film noir has itself loosened up to include almost any moody 1940sstyle film with crime in it which starts lose it's descriptive usefulness.But Jack Nicholson is really a great detective in the Raymond Chandler modesassy fearless on the surface but actually wary and a little scared in the end playing by his own set of rules and working mostly alone. As well made as this movie is in many ways it's Nicholson's physical presence that makes his scenes really work. He's such a natural actor for the camera hesitating just long enough to demand attention but not so long it becomes affected he becomes definitive. And that's enough to make Chinatown classic.The plot too is great dramatic stuff. Based in L.A. with lots of night scenes and period interiors it circles around pretty women and rich men and corrupt politicos and dubious cops. And around water. In a way this makes the movie prescient almostwater being no new topic for Los Angeles but increasingly pertinent in the 1970s. Water is also a MacGuffin in the plot a device we don't care deeply about compared to the interpersonal intrigues the incest the murders. All this other stuff keeps the movie and Nicholson going and it's snappy and well done. It isn't exactly brilliant though and anyone really looking at the screenplay and following the plot might raise an eyebrow now and then or question some of the hyperbole around the movie.It's fun seeing director Roman Polanski appear as a jerky powerhungry kind of thug because maybe it fits him though his friends say otherwise. He has confessed to raping of a young teenager long ago but I have never heard of him actually apologizing for it. I know that's supposed to stay outside of the analysis of the movie and he did do 42 days in jail. Digging further in you can maybe see John Huston's role as a little strained though I love Huston in general and his presence is meant to let us connect to a previous generation of Hollywood and Faye Dunawaye for all her fame is slightly cold at times a little decorative. The movie has lots of strong effects this way and you know that Polanski is a movie lover and the result taken whole is a kind of bowing down to this kind of crime film from earlier on. And in that sense every doubt I have for the movie above could be countered with a simple It was intended that way. And the clichs and familiar plot twists are part of an homage to the medium.Which then begs the questionwhy isn't it filmed with more energy with less prettiness? It doesn't in fact adapt to a rigorous stark shadowy film noir aesthetic but instead layers a very well done but slightly 1970s perfect technically excellent color. Not that it should have been black and white and not that Farewell My Lovely filmed the next year in a really vivid visual film noir style in color in L.A. is the only way to go. But there were options to avoid making it actually too pretty and too tame.All of this is relative nitpicking. I go back to Nicholson. If you can focus on his role his lines his performance capital P you will be mesmerized and impressed again and again. It is a strong movie and an interesting one which is a lot.".

	schema:reviewBody "Chinatown is one of the few movies I consider perfect. I've seen it several times and when I start thinking about it dismantling the several aspects that constitute it I don't find anything wrong about it. Perhaps only Lawrence of Arabia has such an equal perfect synthesis of acting writing cinematography editing story pacing music and atmosphere.The movie starts with private investigator J. J. Gittes following a man named Mulwray whose wife thinks is cheating on her. Gittes takes photos and they make their way into a newspaper. Gittes unknowingly became a pawn in a smear campaign. Furthermore he discovers that Mulwray's real wife Evelyn wasn't the person that hired him. And then Mulwray shows up dead.Chinatown is a movie that simultaneously draws inspiration from the source of film noir and changes this genre. It is not a coincidence that John Huston the director considered the father of film noir The Maltese Falcon plays a supporting role here. Roman Polanski knows his film history and knows how to give credit where credit is due. But Huston was also a good actor so his role here is more than deserved indeed I could not conceive this movie without his performance he plays an odious disgusting unrepentant bastard with such conviction it's difficult to see where the performance ends and the person begins.And then we have Faye Dunaway playing one of the greatest femme fatales in history. She's a mix of untouchable angel and demonic temptress she displays a cold reservation about the people around her a misleading fragility that hides a dangerous mind. Although I've never liked Dunaway much I think no one has come close to portraying hopeless despair and dread as she does in this movie.But Chinatown also modernises the genre. Not that film noir was ever bad but the conception of realism is something that changes with time and what was realistic in Out of the Past or The Maltese Falcon seems unconvincing nowadays. The tough Sam Spade gives way to J.J. Gittes a downtoearth private eye who worries if his involvement with murder suspects and his tinkering with evidence won't make him lose his license and who wears a bandage in his face almost the entire movie after a knife cut. This frailty this concern with mundane details was unthinkable in noir before Jack Nicholson. The '70s have my favourite performances by Nicholson  One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest the movie he made with Antonionni Professione Reporter The Last Detail  and my absolutely favourite is his role as Gittes an otherwise goodintentioned detective who gets involved in something that's too much for someone as insignificant as him to handle. For although he's the hero of the movie he's that modern type of hero that achieves nothing.Chinatown is a movie where nobility and heroism meet a dead end. Fatalism that other gift from classic noir is much present here. Gittes is a man trying to do good in a world that has no conception of goodness anymore and he only makes things worse little by little until the unforgettable foretold ending where everything is tied up. Few movie endings carry such a punch as Chinatown but it's the only ending suitable.Roman Polanski and Robert Towne the original screenwriter deserve all the praise in the world for having created this masterpiece. So do the three main actors. And on a final note Jerry Goldsmith also deserves recognition for his beautiful score so beautiful and delicate in its melancholy that it feels like the movie translated into musical notes. They all deserve to be forever remembered for one of cinema's masterworks.".

Both Jake Gittes and Philip Marlowe exude smugness and insolence both have to contend with and are inexorably drawn to classy women with secrets. And typical of movies that feature gumshoe detectives the stories of both The Big Sleep and Chinatown are confusing and convoluted.Chinatown combines power and corruption with sex and murder into a needlessly complex plot written perhaps deliberately to confound viewers in keeping with traditional noir doctrine which espouses that confusion equals arty sophistication.So who did kill Ida Sessions and how did she get possession of those pictures? Fans of Chinatown would regard such questions as irrelevant just as fans of The Big Sleep would regard the question of who killed Owen Taylor irrelevant. Who cares who the killer was so long as you have the infallible Nicholson as heir to the infallible Bogart to distract attention from the story. Sorry but I just don't agree that a muddled story can be a film's virtue.Chinatown does have its strengths. Good acting permeates the film even among minor characters. But the performance of John Huston was inspired pardon the irony and should have been recognized as such with an academy award. The music too is impressive. The slow lonely horn evokes a dark and brooding mood totally in sync with the classy cinematography.This film has a haunting cinematic atmosphere and to some extent that helps overcome a perplexing plot.".

Sorry but I just don't agree that a muddled story can be a film's virtue.Chinatown does have its strengths. Good acting permeates the film even among minor characters. But the performance of John Huston was inspired pardon the irony and should have been recognized as such with an academy award. The music too is impressive. The slow lonely horn evokes a dark and brooding mood totally in sync with the classy cinematography.This film has a haunting cinematic atmosphere and to some extent that helps overcome a perplexing plot.";

Worse still was director Roman Polanski's rewrite of scenarist Robert Towne's originally happy originally good ending. Spoiler coming Maybe it's just me but I have a serious problem with the way this movie ends. The emotionally distraught Evelyn Mulwray her life and mental health in ruins because of her father is pointing a gun at this heartless monster and only succeeds in shooting a hole through the sleeve of his jacket. Oh come ON. She got herself killed and all she had to show for it was a ruined jacket? Please! Plus the fact that our hero keeps screwing up and repeats the past just defeats his own effort to help Evelyn. I'm sorry I just don't like it. I think it's stupid. Granted it's welldone overall but there is just too much material here that stretches the limits of plausibility. The ending which is supposed to be a very strong point in a film is far too poorly done. Depressing does not make a movie a masterpiece nor does its being a classic.".

	schema:reviewBody "Directed by Polishborn Roman Polanski Chinatown 1974 is often credited with reviving the classic film noir detectivecrime genre exemplified by such '40s and '50s American films as The Maltese Falcon Double Indemnity and Touch of Evil. While classic film noir is characterized by low lit black and white cinematography Polanski managed to infuse Chinatown with a profound sense of corruption and nihilism while setting his tale amid the relentless blazing sunlight of a Southern California drought and despite employing two photographic elements previously thought antithetical to film noir style color film stock and anamorphic widescreen composition. Chinatown's great critical and popular success demonstrated once and for all that the essence of film noir lay mainly in its bleak moral vision not its cinematographic style.Seizing full advantage of the 1968 demise of the Hollywood Production Code and the subsequent liberalization in American cinema's treatment of sex and violence Chinatown builds upon the film noir tradition of exploiting and exploding social taboos. Take for instance the central plot function of incest or the notoriously brutal scene in which Jake Gittes has a protruding part of his anatomy nearly cut off no not literally that part  but the phallic implications are clear and played for sly comedy in subsequent scenes. Yet Polanski also added an entirely new dimension to classic film noir by linking up its darkness with the paranoiddepressive mood of postVietnam postWatergate America thereby extending the noir sense of corruption beyond the mean urban streets and to high governmental and privileged economic places. Chinatown may be set in 1930s L.A. but its soul is in the 1970s.Like earlier film noir private detectives Chinatown's protagonist Jake Gittes a role Jack Nicholson was born to play is derived in large part from the cynical wisecracking hardboiled detective popularized in 1930s novels by such writers as Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett. Also like many earlier film noir works Chinatown adopts a storytelling point of view that is analogous to a mix of first person and third person limited narration in the novel. Such a viewpoint immerses the audience in a subjective search for truth within a maze of deceptive appearances recognizing or failing to recognize clues the bad for glass seawater in the Mulrays backyard the obituary column Noah Cross's bifocals just as Gittes does and not a second sooner. Indeed Chinatown is very unusual in the degree to which it sustains a subjective narrative viewpoint often punctuating it with clever point of view shots using binoculars camera lenses car mirrors and a variety of Peeping Tom setups.Gittes's perspective proves to be much more unreliable even than that of classic film noir era private eyes. Like Chandler's Philip Marlowe and Hammett's Sam Spade Gittes is courageous and resourceful like them and unlike the police he is governed by a code of honor however unconventional or selfdefined. Nevertheless the world in which Gittes operates is far less redeemable by the actions of a detective hero than was the midtwentieth century world of classic noir and eons remote from the optimistic 19th century world of such English detective novel heroes as Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot. Repeatedly in Chinatown the private eye code either fails to function or is subject to mockery  until in the film's shocking last scene Gittes fails for a second time to save a damsel in distress and is led away mumbling do as little as possible while a bought police force ushers the innocent Catherine Mulray into the grasp of her rapacious grandfatherfather.Chinatown's representation of another archetypal film noir character the femme fatale significantly departs from original film noir conventions as well. The casting of vampish looking Faye Dunaway in the role of Evelyn Mulray would seem to fit well enough but what happens to the character in the plot and what even more disturbingly we learn has happened to her in the film's backstory is not at all in keeping with classic noir. Evelyn's alluring deceptions and even her nymphomania are ultimately the effects of her quite literal violation by patriarchal power not another instance of female sexuality ruthlessly wresting power in a man's world. If in classic film noir the death or exposure of the femme fatale is requisite for whatever moral redemption is extracted from the darkness Evelyn's brutal death in Chinatown marks a plunge completely into the darkness.Of course central to the structure of Chinatown is that most noir of all cities Los Angeles centered here on its eponymous Chinatown district where the film's plot climaxes. The scarcity of water in Polanski's Los Angeles transforms the city into a symbolic spiritual Wasteland akin to T.S. Eliot's. But here the fisher king won't die because he is an allpowerful capitalistfather figure willing to do anything without moral restraint. Played in a great piece of postmodern selfreflection by John Huston the father of film noir Noah Cross is also a figure of the AntiChrist. Note his ironically doubled Biblical name his favorite lunch suggestively Christian fish served with the heads on! and his power over water which he diverts not to liberate any chosen people but to line his pockets and own everything he possibly can including the future Mr. Gittes the future. Few if any American mainstream films have bleaker more nihilistic resolutions than Chinatown. And few are more powerful or memorable.".

It's rare to see a star do this as the studios often remade films but hardly ever used the same actors. In addition both films are bundled together on one DVD so you can compare them. After seeing both I would definitely recommend you see LOVE IS NEWS as it's superior in every way.The film is about newspaper man Power harassing a rich heiress Gene Tierney in order to make headlines. It really didn't seem to matter if his articles were true and when Gene finds out that Tyrone is NOT the man he claims to be but a reporter she is furious. However instead of blowing her top she decides to give him a taste of her own medicine by announcing to all the newspapers that she and Power are marriedas she knows that the papers will now make Power's life miserable as well. Oddly in the original film the heiress announces they are engagedhere she claims they are marriedthough this hardly improves the quality of the film though it does provide a bit of sexual innuendo the original didn't have.The acting is decent enough though I really think Loretta Young did a better job in the originalprobably because she seemed to have a better gift for comedy. Also while Tyrone tries he just doesn't seem to have quite the charm he did in the original. Part of this is naturally because it's a remake and part of this is because the supporting characters weren't nearly as strong. In particular the Justice of the Peace was a big weak point here as instead of coming off as comical he's a sadist and pretty much ignores the lawsurefire comedy killers! My advice is see the original. Then if you insist see the remake. BUT don't see the remake firstit just doesn't stack up well and might convince you not to bother with the first film and that would be a big mistake.".

	schema:reviewBody "That Wonderful Urge turned out to be Tyrone Power's last film in the comedy vein. It's a pity that Darryl Zanuck couldn't waste a little money on an original story.If you think you've seen this film before with Power you have. This is a remake of his film Love Is News that he did with Loretta Young back in 1936. Back then films about ditzy heiresses that the Depression era public could laugh it were in vogue. In 1948 this was very old fashioned.Still it's quite humorous as heiress Gene Tierney who is sick tired of all the bad publicity she gets especially from Power who seems to be making a career of writing about her foibles turns the tables on him. Tierney announces to one and all that she's engaged to be married to none other than reporter Power. Now he becomes paparazzi fodder and the tables get turned. Power's not without resources and he finds ways to make the pretend marriage both work and be annoying to Tierney. But I don't think I have to tell you where this will all end.As I said in the review of Love Is News our fascination with heiresses from Barbara Hutton to Paris Hilton seems endless. But it all gets a bit hollow because if Tierney didn't want publicity believe me she wouldn't get it. There are a lot of rich people out there whose lives never become tabloid stories.Still it's amusing and in the supporting cast judges Chill Wills and Gene Lockhart come out the best. In fact Lockhart seems to be continuing his role as a judge from that other 20th Century Fox classic Miracle on 34th Street.That Wonderful Urge is a dated comedy that today's audiences will still get laughs from. We do love our ditzy heiresses.".

This is a remake of his film Love Is News that he did with Loretta Young back in 1936. Back then films about ditzy heiresses that the Depression era public could laugh it were in vogue. In 1948 this was very old fashioned.Still it's quite humorous as heiress Gene Tierney who is sick tired of all the bad publicity she gets especially from Power who seems to be making a career of writing about her foibles turns the tables on him. Tierney announces to one and all that she's engaged to be married to none other than reporter Power. Now he becomes paparazzi fodder and the tables get turned. Power's not without resources and he finds ways to make the pretend marriage both work and be annoying to Tierney. But I don't think I have to tell you where this will all end.As I said in the review of Love Is News our fascination with heiresses from Barbara Hutton to Paris Hilton seems endless. But it all gets a bit hollow because if Tierney didn't want publicity believe me she wouldn't get it. There are a lot of rich people out there whose lives never become tabloid stories.Still it's amusing and in the supporting cast judges Chill Wills and Gene Lockhart come out the best. In fact Lockhart seems to be continuing his role as a judge from that other 20th Century Fox classic Miracle on 34th Street.That Wonderful Urge is a dated comedy that today's audiences will still get laughs from. We do love our ditzy heiresses.";

	schema:reviewBody "This remake of Love is News an OK screwball comedy from 1937 is much weaker than the original for many reasons. The biggest reason is that it seems so out of place in 1948 as compared to 1937 even though it wasn't exactly great then. Once again Tyrone Power is a reporter who wants to get the dirt on one of the world's richest bachlorettes here Gene Tierney instead of Loretta Young. Power was perfect for romantic comedy in 1937 but 10 years have not been kind to him in several ways that has a major impact on his performance. Unlike Rock Hudson who could do these types of roles in 1954 as well as 1964  Power's face not only aged but he lost the youthful glow and became much more serious looking. Probably the best looking actor in Hollywood in the 30's Power had charm that took away from the implausibilities of the original story. By 1948 he was better off in films like Nightmare Alley and The Captain From Castille as his rugged looks had only been enhanced with age. But in comedy he appears slightly tired and it really lessens the impact of the pairing between him and Tierney who really has no place in comedy. A fine dramatic actress for sure but once she starts doing pratfalls it seems forced and she seems most uncomfortable.The major problem is that the world of 1948 was much more serious than the world of 1937 and to portray journalists preying on the rich for scandal seems out of place for frontpage news. Sure society pages yes but on the front page? When Europe is still in recovery there are communist scares everywhere things in Korea are getting hot and race relations are beginning to boil. Power wouldn't seem right in 1948 as any type of reporter but a serious one and working for a scandal sheet seems degrading to him. Loretta Young who played the female lead in Love is News was perfectly balanced as both a dramatic and comic actress perfectly able to deal with breaking a nail while being carried around by handsome Power. She seems to love the kinkiness of their relationship but Tierney is awkward and even embarrassed by this. Power is still funny in spots particularly at a society party which he shows up to embarrass Tierney.The best part of That Wonderful Urge is the supporting cast particularly Lucille Watson as Tierney's aunt. She has played a variety of society dames some domineering and cold but mostly warmhearted and filled with a desire to see the younger generation have the fun she probably had in the beginning of the 20th Century when she was a girl. Reginald Gardiner plays the George Sanders role here and is merely adequate. He lacks Sander's continental charm. Chill Wills takes on the Slim Summerville role of the annoyed small town sheriff who puts Power and Tierney in jail overnight. In comparing the scenes between the two films they are almost identical. Gene Reynolds who could play the most obnoxious of businessmen or politicians is delightful as a judge. Replacing Jane Darwell as Powers' landlady is future Caged star Hope Emerson who was just beginning her rise as an unforgettable Amazonian character actress in films.That Wonderful Urge is not a bad film just out of place in 1948. 20th Century Fox had better films to remake so this was a bad choice. With comedies like State of the Union Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House and The Egg and I shining in 1948 That Wonderful Urge comes off as weak which is acceptable in a B picture but certainly not an A.".

I don't expect that everyone will agree but to me it gets too repetitive arguing whether the two are or want to be married. My guess is that I would feel the same way about Love is News.

As this movie takes a lot from both those movies I was having intense feelings of deja vu at least through the first half of this movie. While both those movies are a little funnier this movie also has some unique charms. Both Gene Tierney and Tyrone Power seemed a little bit old and serious for this type of screwball romantic company. This is a little strange because Tierney was only 27 and Power only 34 when they made the movie. Both look 10 years older. Perhaps it was because they were much meaner to each other than we normally see in a movie of this genre. Tierney doesn't just want to get Power fired but she seems bent on reducing him to utter poverty starvation and impotence. Power looks like he's about to punch Tierney at a couple of points in the film and seems almost to threaten her with rape at one point. This sharpness of conflict between the two romantic leads keeps the movie interesting but it undercuts the romance. The characters are supposed to be on their honeymoon but they act as if they've been married for twenty years and ready to tear each other apart. It is a some times heavy screwball comedy not something you would expect. The movie seems to work against itself by being alternatively pleasant and challenging. We should perhaps appreciate it for being both.".

	schema:text "    The story concentrates on the social readjustment of three World War II servicemen each from a different station of society. Al Stephenson returns to an influential banking position but finds it hard to reconcile his loyalties to exservicemen with new commercial realities. Fred Derry is an ordinary working man who finds it difficult to hold down a job or pick up the threads of his marriage. Having had both hands burnt off during the war Homer Parrish is unsure that his fiance's feelings are still those of love and not those of pity. Each of the veterans faces a crisis upon his arrival and each crisis is a microcosm of the experiences of many American warriors who found an alien world awaiting them when they came marching home.";

	schema:headline " An extraordinary moving postwar film";
	schema:reviewBody "I first saw this film one of my top ten favorites in 1995 on the big screen as part of the commemorations for the 50th anniversary of the end of WWII. It had an impact that was so strong that it's never left meI've seen it many times since and with each viewing the film seems to reveal new artistic richness and spiritual depth.William Wyler's direction is breathtaking.  One of the most moving scenes occurs early on in the film when Homer the young disabled Navy veteran arrives at his family home and stands for a moment on the front lawn.  For that one second there is an exquisite stillness that communicates a depth of emotion that can't be expressed physically.  Then just as the tension becomes almost unbearable Homer's little sister Louella comes to the front door and runs out to greet him.  In a similar way the scene where Al Stephenson comes home to his wife and children is so finely directed you can almost feel that you're in the apartment with themthat it's your husband or father come home to you from the warand you're experiencing the sheer elation of their physical nearness.This aspect of the filmits portrayal of the joys and hardships of postwar readjustment and the veterans' experienceis what makes it so enlightening honest and powerful.  As a young woman I have never experienced wartime or had my father brothers or friends go off to fight. The film moves swiftly but seamlessly from the initial joy of homecoming and reunion to the problems anxieties and humiliations that the three veterans encounter as they attempt to build a new life for themselves and their families.I found it interesting how the film tries to give a picture of the different socioeconomic backgrounds of the three men and show the emergence of an affluent marketdriven economy.  While this in itself is not bad different episodes in the film show how this economic approach can conflict sharply at times with enduring human values such as integrity and justice.  Al's dealings with the young veteran Mr Novak who comes to him for a service loan to buy a farm and his later slightly tipsy speech to a business gathering show this.  Al declares at the end of his speech that when the bank lends money to poor veterans it will be a financial gamble but we'll be gambling on the future of this country.The film's interweaving of the characters and their struggles never falters and is deeply satisfying.  Even as Al and Milly Homer and Wilma gradually move towards a happy resolution of their difficulties this positive strand of the film is counterbalanced by the focus on Fred the courageous Air Force captain who in the eyes of the commercial world is unqualified suitable only for a job at a soda fountain and in the eyes of his war bride Marie is only wonderful when he's dressed up in his officer's uniform.  Fred's situation seems only to deteriorate and at one point in the film after he farewells his elderly father to leave town and look for work the father finds the citations for Fred's medals and sits down to read them. As he reads the words describing Fred's bravery and dedication to duty while he was terribly wounded in his aircraft Pat Derry's voice nearly breaks with pride and love for his son.  The film beautifully juxtaposes Fred's unselfish conduct and willingness to make the ultimate sacrifice with the cold indifference of a country in peacetime that does not want him and seemingly has no place for him.The actors are uniformly impressive and really make their characters come alive.  Dana Andrews is especially outstanding together with two young actors making their debut Harold Russell and Cathy O'Donnell as Homer and Wilma.  Personally I loved Homer and Wilma's story the best among those of all the charactersand the resolution is a simple sensitively shot scene that lifts the whole film to a new point of happiness gratitude and release.  Both Cathy O'Donnell and Teresa Wright are lovely gifted actresses with a slightly understated style that is perfectly suited to the film's restrained but powerful tenor.  This is demonstrated especially well in the tense scene where Wilma tries to talk to Homer in the shed and in the scene where Peggy confides her heartache to her parents.One feature that adds significantly to the film's quality is Hugo Friedhofer's score.  The music is remarkably fresh and undated has a strong classic sound and is poignant without being too romantic or sentimental a flaw often found in other 1940s film scores.The producer Samuel Goldwyn reportedly said of this film I don't care if it doesn't make a nickel...I just want every man woman and child in America to see it.  Although I'm not American I am Australian I found this film with its universal human themes and its portrayal of postwar readjustment speaks to anyone who shares in this heritage of WWII.  Tell others about this filmit is breathtaking beautiful and brave.  See it and remember.".

I believe Coming Home and The Deer Hunter both released in 1978 were the most recent films that were closest in capturing the numerous issues of military men returning from war that were brought up in The Best Years of Our Lives.What really impressed me was watching the movie in its entirety when I was in college around 198081 and many if not all of the college students applauded at the end of the movie.This movie still packs a wallop and I'm very happy to read in other posts other users feeling of a movie that will definitely stand the test of time. I'm very happy to see the movie ranked near the top 100 movies on IMDb and AFI. Also though it was in competition with what eventually became a Christmas classic It's a Wonderful Life arguably The Best Years of Our Lives' Oscar wins including Best Picture were very welldeserved.

	schema:reviewBody "One of the great things about The Best Years of Our Lives that even though it dates itself rather firmly in the post World War II era the issues it talks about are as real today as they were on VE or VJ day of 1945. The problem of how to assimilate returning war veterans is as old as the written history of our planet.And while we don't often learn from history we can be thankful that for once the United States of America did learn from what happened with its veterans after the previous World War. The GI Bill of Rights is mentioned in passing in The Best Years of Our Lives was possibly the greatest piece of social legislation from the last century. So many veterans did take advantage of it as do the veterans like Fredric March Dana Andrews and Harold Russell who you see here.All three of those actors played archetypal veterans characters that every corner of the USA could identify with. They all meet on an army transport plane flying to the home town of all of them Boone City Iowa.War is a great leveler of class and distinction. Bank employee March soda jerk Andrews and high school football star Russell probably would never meet in real life even in a small town like Boone City. But they do meet and war forges indestructible bonds that can never be broken.March is the oldest a man with two children and Hollywood's perfect wife Myrna Loy. He settles in the first and the best. He has some wonderful scenes getting cockeyed drunk on his return and later with a little bit of liquor in him tells the bank officials at a banquet off in no uncertain terms.I also love his scene where another returning veteran a sharecropper wants to get a bank loan for his own piece of land. Watch March's expressions as he listens to the man's pitch for money. You can feel him read the man's soul. It's what got him his Second Best Actor Oscar for this film.Harold Russell was a real veteran who lost both his hands during service in the Pacific. He got a special recognition Oscar for his performance. Because of that it was probably unfair to nominate him in the Supporting Actor category which he also won in. His performance especially his scenes with Cathy O'Donnell as his sweetheart who loves him with or without his hands is beyond anything that could be described as acting.Dana Andrews is the only officer of the three a bombardier in the Army Air Corps. Of the group of them maybe he should have stayed in. He also comes from the poorest background of the group and he was an officer and a gentleman in that uniform. That uniform and those monthly allotment checks are what got Virginia Mayo interested enough to marry him. The problem is that he's considerably less in her eyes as a civilian.While Mayo is fooling around with Steve Cochran Andrews has the great good fortune to have March's daughter Teresa Wright take an interest in him. They're the main story of the film Andrews adjustment to civilian life and adjusting to the fact he married the wrong woman. Not all veteran's problems were solved with GI Bill.Myrna Loy gets little recognition for The Best Years of Our Lives. My guess is that it's because her role as wife was too much like the stereotypical wife roles she had patented over at MGM. Still as wife to March and mother to Wright she really is the glue that holds that family together.The Best Years of Our Lives won for Best Picture for Sam Goldwyn Best Director for William Wyler and a few others besides the two acting Oscars it got. It was a critical and popular success possibly the best film Sam Goldwyn ever produced. It remains to this day an endearing and enduring classic and will be so for centuries. It's almost three hours in length but never once will your interest wane.The best tribute this film received came from Frank Capra who had a film of his own in the Oscar sweepstakes that year in several categories. In his memoirs he said that he was disappointed to be skunked at the Oscars that year but that his friend and colleague William Wyler had created such a masterpiece he deserved every award he could get for it.By the way the film Capra had hopes for was It's A Wonderful Life. The Beat Years of Our Lives can't get better praise than that.".

But what especially stood out to me this time was how amazing Dana Andrew's performance is. His wife has cheated on him he's suffering postwar trauma and can't find a jobbut he's still charming and funny. Even though his opinion of himself is pretty low he keeps going ahead. I love how selfdenigrating the character is how he suspects he's pretty worthless while his parents friends and Peggy but not his wife see him as extraordinary. And Andrews does it all while being understated and real. Yeah Dana!".

But what especially stood out to me this time was how amazing Dana Andrew's performance is. His wife has cheated on him he's suffering postwar trauma and can't find a jobbut he's still charming and funny. Even though his opinion of himself is pretty low he keeps going ahead. I love how selfdenigrating the character is how he suspects he's pretty worthless while his parents friends and Peggy but not his wife see him as extraordinary. And Andrews does it all while being understated and real. Yeah Dana!";

This movie tells several stories so well simultaneously that it was the first few times a movie I could not watch to completion. It was too real....and the characters SO STRONG that watching it became a personal struggle. Seeing these three men and their families deal with their hardships one in particular often hit me too hard. Now I have watched in its entirety without interruption several times and I realize what I always suspected. This movie is a masterpiece. The writing the acting the blending of several stories without being even the least bit choppy everything about this movie is exceptional. Seven Academy Awards? No wonder it certainly must have deserved them.".

It's the scenes just off camera and the unspoken dialog which resonates the most loudly however.  The awkward intimacy of Frederich March and Myrna Loy and his struggle to return to his place as leader both at home and at work are heartbreaking.Dana Andrews is riveting as the handsome decorated Captain who struggles to keep his life together without the uniform.The film is filled with honest characters and each is portrayed by a gifted actor.This film however took on a whole other level after seeing Saving Private Ryan.  The reality and magnitude of what these men lived through for love and country......and obviously it didn't end on the battlefield.This is an essential for any collection.".

Returning servicemen with all kinds of backgrounds before and during the war hit a wall coming home wives who no longer loved them jobs that had dried up a culture that was foreign to them and that found them these men to be foreign themselves.It wasn't a crisis to take lightly. These were the guys who were drafted to fight the enemy and in going overseas they lost some of the best years of their lives if not their lives. The country knew its debt in the abstract but it also knew it in sons and husbands who really did come home and who had to face it all. This movie was both a reckoning for the sake of national healing and a brilliant drama that would be beautifully pertinent and therefore successful. And what a success then and now.The consummate Hollywood director William Wyler shows in this fast long movie just what a master he is at working the medium. With Gregg Toland at the camera Wyler makes a highly fluid movie visual and dramatic and weirdly highly efficient. With the three main plots interweaving and depending on each other the drama and melodrama build but never beyond plausibility. Wyler knew his audience wouldn't put up with pandering or cheap mistakes. Casting Harold Russell as Homer knowing the audience would hear about how Russell really was a soldier who lost both hands in the war was a huge step toward creating both empathy and credibility. It even practices a key theme in the moveto go beyond your bounds to make a difference to give these guys a break and help them assimilate.It's interesting how singular this movie is trying to show the truth in these kinds of situations. The other postwar films about army and navy men fall into two large and dominating categorieswar films and film noir. And it is film noir that comes closest to getting at the problem of the G.I. not reintegrating well making it a whole style brooding and spilling over with violence. The Best Years of Our Lives has a highly controlled and even contrived plot structure but it aims to be honest and representative. That it's remarkable formallythe way it is shot and edited and acted top to bottomis not surprise given the heights that Hollywood had reached by then and given that Wyler is easily the slickest of them all in the best sense. That the movie makes such beautiful sense and really works as a story a moving and heartwarming story without undue sappiness is a whole other kind of achievement.

	schema:reviewBody "There are several thoughtful reviews of this movie here already  most all of which I concur with.I'll try to add a couple of unique comments about this most wonderful of films.It occurred to me that some of this films greatest and most touching moments are told without dialogueThe scene so many readers here have already mentioned  when Fred visits the boneyard for all those bombers waiting for the scrap heap. Through the camera work and Mr. Andrews' acting we too are transported back to his harrowing missions aboard one of these planes. The urgency the fear the terror the danger are all palpable at once as though we're in the cockpit too flying over Europe against great enemy resistance even though it's a sunny day somewhere in America in a lot  for surplus aircraft. When I watched that scene I felt like I really knew what tremendous ordeals he had endured. I felt for Fred now that this plane that had been so decisively important just as he himself had been so important risking his life in service to his country as part of the plane's crew suddenly no longer served any useful purpose.The scene where Homer is just about to go to his girlfriend's Wilma's house as planned  but he stops and he watches her through the window as she works in the kitchen and plainly we see that she is dear to him. But instead of going in to see her with great struggle he changes his mind and he goes home and to his room. What a sweet room it is! It's the room he left  just out of high school  to join the navy. It's a high school student's room a boy's room in his parent's house with his trophies and pennants on the wall. He looks around at his boyhood triumphs and  we see through the camera  he stops and looks at his posed portrait in his football uniform his right arm cocked back holding the football his left arm pointing towards the imaginary receiver his head up proud and his gaze confident and purposeful. And then he looks at an action shot of himself dribbling the basketball past defenders. I can't begin to assess what Homer could be feeling at that moment  feelings of loss? of uselessness? Is he thinking that he'll be forever a boy  dependent on his parents and that he'll never be able to be his own man? That sequence  all without dialogue  speaks volumes!The kicker for me though is the reminder that this is not merely a character in a story that has moved me but this is also a real person who lost both his hands in service to his country. Those photographs of him holding the football and dribbling the basketball sure look to me like they are real pictures of the real person Mr. Harold Russell who plays Homer. What kind of courage did he have to look those things in the face for millions of viewers to witness? And how hard was it for Mr. Russell the person to make light of his character's and his own real life disability by playing Chopsticks on the piano with his hooks for everyone's amusement?Those two scenes stick in my mind as the most powerful to me  but there are so many more in this movie. It's worth noting that they were so effective without any dialogue at all. An actor shares a soul stirring revelation and it is carefully captured and revealed for us with sensitive and skillful film making.This is one of those movies that would go on a very short list of all time favorites. It's not perfect  when I can detach myself emotionally from the people in this story I can say that it could possibly be just a little heavy handed with it's message but to watch this movie with all it's masterful performances from so many in the cast all assembled so lovingly and with great such great care by a great director  I have to think that it is very near perfect.I read here on IMDB under Harold Russell's plays Homer bio that he sold his Oscar in order to pay for surgery for his wife!! He is still living retired on Cape Cod. Someone somehow should get his Oscar back to him. It seems so wrong!! He paid very dearly with flesh and blood and bone and then had to while on display stare his loss in the face for the benefit of the movie going public. Someone should return his Oscar to him  the Academy? Steven Spielberg? Tom Hanks? William Wyler's heirs? I don't know who but someone should really do that for him. It seems like a small price to pay for what he gave.".

A truly ironic title THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES is anything but since those times have vanished into still images and all that is left is an uncertain future for those involved.Truly an ensemble cast despite the topbilling of Myrna Loy THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES focuses more on the stories of the men. Al Stephenson Fredric March comes back to a household that has irrevocably changed as his sons have grown although he finds support from his doting wife Milly Myrna Loy. Fred Derry upon returning cannot find a decent job despite being a war veteran and is trapped in a marriage that he does not want to Marie a happygolucky girl who wants more out of life and who increasingly comes to hate him. Homer Parrish on the other hand has greater problems due to his loss of hands at war and feels the entire world  including the girl he loves and her family  thinks he is a freak of nature.At almost three hours of length the film never seems long and drawn out. There is so much emotions happening even in small moments that the plot breezes by nothing seems wasted or placed on screen due to a lack of editing. Not a performance rings false though the standouts are those of Dana Andrews as Fred Derry Harold Russell as Homer Parrish and Virginia Mayo as Marie Derry. Even then every character has his or her moment on film and the time was right to talk about all the pain and suffering that until then had not been seen in American films including the ones made around World War One which did not dabble in such topics. While there is never any overt violence it's all there in the haunted expressions of the three male leads' faces in the lot where the planes now reside ready to be turned into junk and therefore forgetfulness in the cynicism of the store owners who couldn't be bothered to employ these shellshocked men who had seen battle or even worse to goad them into wondering what was it all worth for. This is the film in which COMING HOME and BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY are indebted to. At a time when America fled from war films to come up with this when the end of the Second World War was still fresh was a necessity in order to make a more honest filmmaking.".

Andrews has perhaps his best role as a man struggling to make ends meet. Also good are Wright as a lovesick young woman Mayo as Andrews' trampy wife and reallife veteran Russell as a man who lost both his hands. However top honors go to March and Loy as a longmarried couple facing challenges while getting reacquainted with each other.".

	schema:reviewBody "Best Years of Our Lives is a film that slipped under my radar for yearsI had heard about it but never had the opportunity to watch it. Thanks to TCM On Demand I was able to watch it uncut and commercial free.What surprised me about this film was how quickly it was made after the war. The film frankly deals with the people who were wounded in the war both physically and mentally. It manages neatly to encompass nearly all the varieties of war experience within three characters.We have the Air Force officer who was a veteran of the early European bombing campaign. Because of the horrific attrition rate amongst the crews of the bombers the Air Force at that time had a reputation for cranking out officers who quickly rose through the ranks. Such was case with this fellow who went from a lowly soda jerk in civilian life to a Captain and bombardier of his B17. He also suffers from PTSD called battle fatigue at the time.We have the Army noncom who served in the Pacific and suffered through the horrors of that campaign. His story is opposite that of the Air Force fellow in that he goes from a prestigious job as a banker to a lowly grunt in the Army and rises to the rank of Sergeant. From the stripes on his sleeve it is clear that he is the highest level of Sergeant yet he is still on the front line.Finally we have the Navy Seaman who is part of the faceless support staff commonly referred to as REMFs Rear Echelon MFersby the fellows on the line. Ironically he suffers the worst physical wounds when working as a mechanic below decks on a Navy ship his ship is struck presumably by a kamikaze and is sunk with loss of 400 lives. He is pulled from the water but his badly burned hands are amputated and replaced with prosthetic hooks.BYOOL tells the story of how these three meet on a transport plane they have boarded for home and how they readjust into civilian society.What impressed me most about this film is that despite the obvious issues that face the three protagonists it never descends into melodrama. The Navy kid played by an actual amputee is placed into situations where we might feel sorry for him yet the script never lets us feel that emotion. The Army sergeant is clearly an alcoholic and the story points that out but never dwells on it. The Air Force captain struggles with the loss of status when he is forced to return to the drug store he soda jerked in now bought out by a large chain and take a demeaning job to support his ungrateful and disloyal wife.The script allows plenty of opportunities for all these characters to come to some dramatic climax regarding their plights but it neatly avoids that. But for the overly dramatic score the director has tread around exploiting the obvious.In one scene that well represents the entire movie the daughter of the Army sergeant Frederic March is having a discussion with her father and mother regarding the Air Force captain. Despite his marriage they have fallen in love and she is determined to break up the marriage which is obviously troubled. Now we've seen thousands of scenes typical of this where the father blusters angrily and the daughter ends up running away to her room in tears slamming the door and falling on the bed. Later Mom shows up consoles daughter and offers words of motherly wisdom and everybody lives happily ever after.In BYOOL this scene plays out completely differently than the clich I have described above. Sure the conversation gets heated but all parties are reasonable and there is a serious and timeless discussion of the nature of relationships that has some of the best dialog I have seen.Ultimately BYOOL is a highly satisfying film with honest performances from the entire cast. Technically it is well shot the editing and cinematography frame but never overshadow the gripping narrative. Despite the score which is clich and overdramatic I give this film the highest rating that it clearly deserves".

Their only commonality is the desire to make a serious comment about a war that took millions of lives. It is hard to know what value individual life may have. How many people know that 1 in 22 people lost their lives violently in the last century? What a statistic we have to live with. Also our feelings about war have changed in 60 years. We have progressively moved from thinking that war is just if the enemy is the right one to believing that no war is totally just especially the ones that have been fought recently.I have been a life long pacifist. I oppose all war. Not long ago I had that position tested. It occurred while I was on the USS Lexington which is permanently anchored in Corpus Christi Texas. The ship required a crew that is 3 or 4times the community in which I live. It is a powerful experience moving around on her decks. She had seen a great deal of action. Someone granted me the right to be a pacifist and it was not cheaply bought.I cannot watch The Best Years of Our Life without thinking about things like the Lexington.Each of the three veterans paid their dues. And they paid mine as well.No one of them got off any easier than any other. The Navy Air Force and Army paid equally although in different ways. Each had problems directly related to the war. And each had to work terribly hard to overcome those difficulties. It took more courage to face their civilian surroundings than it did to deal with war because each had to do it on his own. Each could understand and sympathize with the problem of the others ultimately no one could help.The moving part of the film this could be the beginning part of the spoiler is what follows when one of the male leads found someone who knew enough to give advice. The obvious case is when Derry told Herald to marry the girl. Don't hesitate do it tomorrow. It is hard for Harold to believe that anyone could love him when he had been a football hero and athletic star before the war. But to his credit Harold listens.The other is when Al tells Derry to stay away from his daughter. The meaning was clear. Mend your relationship with your wife  standard fair for 30's40's films. Derry did not debate the point he felt he was not fit for Al's daughter. So he agreed. The truth of the film comes out when we consider the daughter feels the same way about Derry. Real emotions from real people. I think our era has deep problems with feelings and sentiment and honor. I sometimes think we believe these values do not exist. That's perhaps why people looking at this film have problems.Al is not free of advice he does not totally want. Any time his boss talks to him Al gets tied in knots. And rightly so. There are some things that cannot be judged by the standards of occupation they must be judged by huge general intangibles and only someone tested by the severities of life would understand what those intangibles are.All of this leads up to a scene near the end where all the planes that fought so valiantly are stripped stacked stored discarded and soon to be recycled their function worth and pride as translucent as Derry himself. He can overcome that translucency which he does making him fit in his mind for the woman he loves.I gave The Best Years of Our Lives a 10 and there are few films I feel that way about. This is not a film for popcorn. It deserves our attention. We are very privileged to eves drop on something so private as the lives of these wonderful people. We ought to be careful that we don't abuse that privilege.".

	schema:reviewBody "At the beginning of this movie it seems like it is just going to be another World War II movie but it is not. There are no battle scenes there are only stories of the events from overseas. Not many movies show the after effects of war. Many will just show a lot of violence to try to do better in the box office. This movie focuses more on a touching story. Also for this movie to be released at the same time as many soldiers were coming home it was not only a timely movie but it must have been important to the soldiers for it to be accurate.When we are shown Fred trying to catch a flight home in the opening sequence he is not exactly welcomed with open arms. I can only imagine what that must have felt like to a returning veteran. Not only that but also to come home and struggle to find a decent job and having no other choice but to return to work as a soda jerker would be a such a shame. That was hard enough for Fred but Homer probably had it the worst. He came home with no arms and found his life was turned completely upside down because of it. I liked that in the end though things worked out for him. As for Al he came home and had a pleasant family and his old job waiting for him. All three of them had different ranks from different branches of the military but when they returned home they were just like everybody else trying to survive in the rat race rather than the fox hole.Even though it is definitely obvious that their paths will cross again early in the movie I liked how the three stories intertwined. The film also builds suspense subtly possibly without the average viewer even realizing it like how we never see Homer's hooks uncovered until near the end of the film. Naturally Greg Tolland does a great job in the cinema photography department. Deep focus is put to good use they did not use it just because they could. The scene where Homer is playing the piano and Fred is in the phone booth in the background is a prime example. I also noticed a lot of creative shots done with mirrors throughout the movie.I found this movie to be quite good overall. I usually do not like long movies like this unless there is something special or unique about it. What I liked most about this movie was good storytelling. That is what I always look for the most in a film and this one has it. I think the movie is deserving of the numerous awards it received.".

This movie is a time capsule of what is was like in the 1940's. A must see movie for any true movie fan. Some critics have said this movie has aged. I disagree. The theme of human desires is timeless. And the obstacles faced by veterans returning from war will always be with us. This is just a great movie  one that can be watched over and over again.".

	schema:reviewBody "I learned about the movie from reading a note on the CD that had its music as one of many great film scores.  The note about the movie was so favorable I had to see it.  The music is very moving and subtle it really contributes to this fine movie. The two finest scenes for me have not even been discussed yet...The scene where Fred Derry's parents are reading his award citation makes me cry.  I am moved whenever respect is shown and appreciation is given when there is an understanding of sacrifice and of honor.  The only similar scene which comes to mind now is that great moment from To Kill a Mockingbird when Atticus Finch leaves the courtroom after having failed to win Tom Robinson's freedom when all of the black folks in the balcony plus his own kids stand to show him respect. The scene in the cockpit when Fred Derry is reliving his war experiences. The music takes over and he is overwhelmed with the intensity of the memories.  This scene is big for me because I was a sailor and I did some neat things in uniform and was in on some intense action.  After I left the military I had a letdown  what is more important that waging war defending your country and trying to save livesminimize casualties?  I had to realize that those feelings of contribution and worthiness and importance can never be matched again.  There are other types of worthiness like being a dad and a husband  but these are very different.  Regular life is of a different pace with more competing responsibilities.  Its all about balance rather than objective.So these two scenes meant a great deal to me when I first saw them and they still do. What a wonderful film!".

	schema:headline " Intense and compelling. Kudos to Dana Andrews for an incredibly great performance.";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a great movie with outstanding performances by the entire cast especially Dana Andrew's and Harold Russell's. Although released just after World War Two the movie has survived the test of time principally because of the the nature of the story which deals with issues that are timeless in their relevancy. This movie is proof that they don't make 'em like that anymore. It is hard to imagine Hollywood being able to recreate this movie today. The audience would be able to relate to the story  who couldn't?. But who'd play the roles? Could any actor today play Fred Derry without it becoming a laughable caricature of the returning war vet? Could any actor today play an Al Stephenson without coming off as being a bloated middleaged phony? The trouble with Hollywood today is that when it tries to make a movie about a serious subject especially one based on actual events it usually becomes a confused jumble of special effects interspersed with inane dialogue which veers away from the actual historical event which is shunted to the background. There are exceptions. Forrest Gump with Tom Hanks and Gary Sinese deals in part with the subject of returning war vets but that is not the main theme of the movie. Saving Private Ryan with Tom Hanks Vin Diesel and Tom Sizemore must get high marks for its excellent portrayals of soldiers in combat but this movie deals with soldiers who are still fighting not the postwar aftermath. Dear Hunter with Robert DeNiro and Christopher Walken Born on the Fourth of July with Tom Cruise and Coming Home with Jon Voight and Jane Fonda are about postwar adjustment issues and all three are very good very powerful movies. But even these movies have certain melodramatic features that make them rather stagy with more focus on interpersonal dysfunctionality than on the actual events that may have contributed to the problematic behavior. The closest that Hollywood comes to approaching Best Years in terms of artistic style and thematic content is The Men with Marlon Brando made in 1950. Filmed in a filmnoir style Best Years is far more subdued far more intense far more sophisticated far less hysterical and therefore far more compelling than the other aforementioned movies. Anyway go watch the movie.One other item. This movie is proof that Dana Andrews was one of the greatest actors ever in the history Hollywood. The entire movie centers around his performance as Fred Derry a character which Mr. Andrews brings to life and which has become a symbol for all soldiers who return home.".

I believe it is one of the best movies ever made period. It alternates with Casablanca for my alltime favorite movie depending on which one I have seen most recently.The best compliment I can pay to this movie is that I hold it in such high regard despite having gone into my first viewing wanting to hate it. How dare this film win the best picture Oscar over my favorite movie at the time It's a Wonderful Life went my thinking. But when I saw Best Years I was blown away and I understood.Best Years has an unbelievable number of scenes that bring a tear to the eye or a lump to the throat with only a couple of those being the result of sadness and with most being caused by beautiful depictions of love loyalty pride patriotism or the overcoming of personal adversity. I only need to hear the opening strains of the Homer and Wilma theme music before the bedroom scene to start losing it.What I enjoy most about the plot is how steadfast all of the lead women are each in their own unique way. I know Harold Russell and Fredric March won the Oscars and they were great but for me Dana Andrews as Fred and the wonderful Teresa Wright as Peggy are the standouts. I find Fred's statement that Peggy should be put into mass production to be very apt.One final aspect of the movie that fascinates me is how it can be such a perfect timecapsule of 1940s America yet still not feel dated in terms of its human interactions.I am on the clock waiting for my next opportunity to enjoy this complete and utter masterpiece!".

One has lost his hands in an accident one has become bitter and dissatisfied with the treatment of his fellow military comrade and the third goes back to his wife who has no interest in him anymore who is only interested in a meal ticket. We get to see how war has changed these people. The handicapped man is the most obvious as he longs for normalcy yet watches as his family and friends drop into a depressed state utterly aware of his limitations. They don't mean to but they take away his humanity. He falls into the pits of depression almost driving away the one who loves him most. The other two wrestle with their own demons. This is beautifully presented in a subtle way without being maudlin. Of course Hollywood requires a sappy ending. Still the rest of the movie including the great Hoagie Carmichael as a piano playing bar owner stands on its own merit. I hadn't seen this movie in nearly forty years and it was a delight.".

Everything in it fits perfectly. It's incredibly entertaining and at the same time is absolutely thoughtprovoking because the characters seen on the screen and the situations they cope with are universal and timeless thus anyone can feel identified with them. Nevertheless many would argue that the length of the movie almost three hours may be a drawback but I don't agree. In fact the producers as usual organized a test screening before the official premiere to check what the audience didn't like about the film but the people considered the plot so haunting and gripping that the producers eventually decided not to modify a single scene of the movie which is not very frequent.Widely praised by critics and awarded with 8 welldeserved Oscars including best motion picture this masterpiece soon became a huge box office success that still remains adjusting the ticket price to inflation as one of the most topgrossing movies of all time.

	schema:headline " 3in1 Film Romance Thriller and Social Realism!";
	schema:reviewBody "The Constant Gardener seeks to juggle three film stylesthe romance the thriller and provocative social realism. On all three levels the film succeeds especially with the latter.Much credit should go to director Fernando Meirelles who has synthesized a virtual textbook of different film techniques. The uses of setups location filming lenses film editing and closeups were simply dazzling. While the panoramic scenes of the African landscape were breathtaking there was a starkly contrasting approach to the closeups in the scenes in the city. The jittery handheld camera sequences added to the dramatic tension and underscored the urgency of coming to terms with poverty and disease.The romantic portion of the film was anchored by the two characters played by Ralph Fiennes Justin and Rachel Weisz Tessa. Their first meeting was dynamically presented as Tessa was a social activist heckling Justin as he was making a political speech. When the hall was cleared however it was Justin who was actually comforting Tessa after her outburst. The juxtaposition of the placid passive Justin versus the fervent hyperkinetic Tessa was brilliantly established in that opening scene. The strands of thriller and social realism are inextricably tied together in the film. As a whodunit The Constant Gardener seeks to uncover what actually happened to Justin and Tessa on their African journey. At the same time the main culprit that emerges is the heavy hand of greed as the pharmaceutical companies exploit helpless victims of tuberculosis for the purpose of testing and marketing an experimental drug. At one point in the film it is disclosed to Justin that the pharmaceutical industry is no different than arms dealers.Another British film entitled The Girl in the Caf appeared recently on American cable television. That gem of a film is a lowbudget version of The Constant Gardener. Both films seek to raise consciousness about the tragedy of world hunger and disease. The title of The Constant Gardener is an important one because of the time and care taken by Justin in his garden both at work and at home. In the process however he has ignored the urgent pleas of his wife and he has lost touch with the world crisis to which he is arguably a contributor. The eighteenthcentury French writer Voltaire ended his famous novel Candide with the slogan One must cultivate one's garden. This film would appear to suggest that instead of tending our gardens we need to follow the lead of Justin and Rachel and see how we all might work to help others right now.".

Rachel Weisz is an illuminating revelation turning in the performance of her career. Her character develops and becomes even more compelling after she dies and we learn her secrets through expertly paced flashbacks. Director Fernando Meirelles takes the amazing style he honed with City of God and adds a heart with The Constant Gardener a big heart that bleeds a beautiful cinematic poeticism onto the screen.This film truly rewards its audience as it works on so many levels. Like this year's earlier wordofmouth and hotbutton issue sleeper Crash you won't be able to stop talking about it after you leave the theater. The politics here are engaging and bound to stir up even the most complacent viewer. What's even more amazing is that all of the timely political discourse and subsequent thriller aspects of the film courtesy of the source material John Le Carre's novel are wrapped up in a timeless romance. We the audience join Fiennes on his journey and we rediscover the love story between he and his wife that anchors the film in a poetic realism usually reserved for movies with much less on their minds.To top it off it's all delivered in the maddeningly genius Meirelles style that took critics and audiences by storm in his debut City of God. We have the shaky handheld camera darting through vibrant and colorful thirdworld locales juxtaposed with jawdroppingly gorgeous aerial photography of Africa in all its blazing glory. Meirelles again shows us he is a true artist willing to show both the shocking beauty and abject horror of the people and places that populate his films. Again he delivers a message that people are doing horrible things to other people the world over be it in the form of wishywashy governments turning a blind eye greedy corporations putting a price tag on a human life local thugs preying on the misfortune of their neighbors or friends betraying friends. With City of God he seemed to be saying the only hope is to document it. With The Constant Gardener he makes that argument again and takes it one brilliant step forward. We may not be able to stop a war or a huge global injustice but we do have the power to help one person at a time. It takes a courageous film to make such a statement and a brilliant filmmaker to deliver it and that's just what The Constant Gardener does.".

Weisz is perfection as Tessa Qualye a civil rights activist who is murdered for trying to bring awareness of their illegal practices on the poor natives of an African village. Weisz gives her character a selfrighteous drive that is made poignant by her determination and sheer will and she also makes her character human not a stereotype which makes her performance the more real. Ralph Finnes plays her grieving husband Justin who takes up her cause and begins to lean of how wonderful his wife really was and what he missed during the time she was alive. His haunted performance is in my opinion his best ever and is the driving point of this haunting odyssey of justice lost and self sacrifice. Rachel Weisz and Ralph Fiennes both deserve Oscar nominations for their superb performances and Fernando Meirelles deserves one as well for his superb direction that puts you smack in the middle of the story that is unfolding right in front of you.Hands down the best film of the year so far.".

The direction cinematography and editing is superb. If you loved the style of City of God with its documentary style camera work then you'll love this too. The story is done nonlinear like it was in the book.and I thought it made the experience of seeing the movie so much more enjoyable. Since the film starts off very early with the death of Tessa and then continues with Justin's journey of discovery to find out the cause of her death which only seems to bring even more heartache and anger.....the nonlinear style allowed for some light hearted moments from Justin and Tessa's marriage to break up the tension.The performances by both Rachel Weisz and Ralph Fiennes are excellent. The relationship between Justin and Tessa came across as very real and touching and it's a testament to the chemistry between the 2 actors. The intimate moments were some of the most realistic I have ever seen of a couple in love...unlike Hollywood movie love. Fiennes performance is unforgettable. I would have to rate this very close to the quality I saw in Schindler's List. He demonstrates such a change from the beginning of the movie to the end. He conveys so much with just his face. Justin will break your heart especially as he gains wisdom. The soundtrack provides a wonderful complement to Justin's journey of discovery. The music has a haunting quality as does this movie. It's a testament to Meireilles that the movie seems to slowly draw you in and hooks you as you go along with Justin. It challenges the viewer to see the poverty and forces you to face your own complacency in the world. So as Justin gains wisdom and is forced out of his complacency.. it is like Meireilles is turning the mirror towards the audience and asking them Do you see what's happening in the world? What are you going to do about it?. It is a powerful and moving story and I think will soon become a favorite. I expect nominations for all the major categories.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is very competently made but I think in the final analysis fine performances fine production design and fine cinematography count for little when a film is so wrapped up in its smug selfdeception that it demeans the causes it affects to champion. Justin Quayle Ralph Fiennes a decenthearted civil servant falls in love with Tessa Rachel Weisz a political activist brimming with youthful righteousness. At the beginning of the film Tessa weeps and rants about the decision to go to war with Iraq we have the clich of the overemotional woman whose excess of feeling is supposed to chasten the buttoneddown conformity of the people around her. She says nothing of interest about Iraq. The subject of Iraq is a mere dramatic shorthand for any fashionable subject about which people like us hold the same opinion. Not two minutes later of screen time at any rate! our couple are shown having beautifullyphotographed sex. Beautiful souls to beautiful bodies  how appropriate! How exquisitely civilized! I know an Iraqi guy who told me that in England when people find out that he is Iraqi they almost always apologise  I'm so so sorry. Why he asked me do they do that? Of course I replied that the majority of us in the UK opposed the war and we feel appalled by the misery that has ensued and that the Labour government having been legitimately elected we all feel in some way responsible for its policies. However watching The Constant Gardener a more sinister explanation presents itself. Perhaps those apologies to this random Iraqi are offered more as narcissistic tributes to the English person's sense of ethical superiority. Perhaps what they are saying is how beautiful I am that I care. And Africa? We have only one properly presented African character a doctor who has to have Tessa do his talking for him when the big men are around and who has in fact so little in the way of a rounded character that he can be arbitrarily labelled as gay half way through the film to service a plottwist. Otherwise the Africans are smiling children of the sort beloved of passing tourists or corrupt policemen in flyblown offices. There is no more than a superficial effort made to present the African locations as specific coherent societies. Africa is merely an object for the viewer's compassion or repulsion. The constantly whirling camerawork flings us into the exhilarating chaos it never occurs to the filmmakers to stop and actually look at anything. That said the plot mechanics do their mechanical thing efficiently enough and the characters get a bit sweaty with the stress and fast activity. Look elsewhere however for emotional risk or psychological insight. If the unexamined life is not worth living neither is the life turned admiringly in the hand like a priceless netsuke. The Constant Gardener with it's smugly cathartic ending allows no unpolished feeling to disrupt its narcissism. I wonder if this narcissism isn't symbolised in the film by Quayle's mourning the loss of Tessa political activism motivated by private erotic conscience a gentlemanly pre occupation with the conflict between duty and propriety. The Constant Gardener ends up insulting Africa rather than redeeming it precisely because it has redemption on it's mind. One could defend it I suppose by saying that it at least raises the issues but there is nothing empowering nothing motivating about this film. It is in fact extremely boring. As it drags into its second hour it is a movie one feels oneself wading though up to one's waist in the sludge of fine cinematography and flashy editing. But films like this will always find a place in the market as gloss substitutes for genuine attempt at care and insight. The times will continue to demand them".

	schema:headline " Undirected dribble";
	schema:reviewBody "Its difficult to convey how much of a disappointment the Constant Gardener was. On a scale of 1 to 10 it would be 25 for several reasons.Firstly as a thriller the ending was in the synopses  we knew the culprits and the deeds. This leaves the details providing the only dramatic tension which were slowly and painfully dragged out of the characters in a way which left the audience gasping for events to complete themselves.Secondly the characterisation left the audience disinterested in the main parties. Fiennes' love for Weisz is drawn in so many clichs and is so poorly sketched by the repetitive flashbacks that we are left wondering why they were so interested in each other in the first place. The film then fails completely by centring the plot on this vapid excuse of a relationship. We see Fiennes cry over their first meeting without knowing what exactly formed the basis of their relationship or why they had married. Its sad but I couldn't care less about his grief when I don't really understand why he is grieving or believe in the relationship.Thirdly the film itself was a dog. Each character spoke in a continuous monotone in a language which I assume was the screen writers idea of how diplomats and aid workers speak to each other. With the exception of Bill Nighy who should have been given more screen time each actor or actress was reduced to barking their lines to a fridge buzz. Worse the direction was scattergun and failed to take advantage of the potential for holding any kind of drama in the situation. To try and pick the pace up a few carhorse chases are thrown in to make up for the previous hour and a bit's plodding. They are too late i'm afraid.Fourthly it did a total disservice to a very deserving topic. This should have been a brilliant film. Instead it was a dull shell over some very worth while points about the irresponsibility of corporate power. I'd much rather seen a documentary about some real events than entertain this poor exercise in intellectual entertainment and chin stroking cynically designed to satisfy the audiences' selfregard.There is a good corporate thriller and it is The Insider. In that film no one dies yet it is compelling and fascinating despite being about a fairly idiosyncratic topic. Four people die in The Constant Garderner yet I was completely unmoved. 310 please try harder.".

I am still figuring out what was Hair raising in the entire film  what was so memorable about the end. As soon One plays the Movie he or she shall struck immediately by a Deja Vu effect a reminiscent of The English Patient which in turn was a massive boredom. And then one realizes that what its like to see a movie which is lifted from a romantic thriller Novel which keeps on narrating events which are good only for reading  which is made from Director who is aspiring to hit the Oscars. So The Constant Gardener is not at all a Thriller nor a Noir nor an Adventure. Its just a collective shots of various events undergone through the main line of characters and some boring scenes which are only good for Novel. Director Fernando Meirelles seems to have lacked the ability to establish the Drama for a Big screen from a Novel based Screenplay. After seeing this film We then admire the work of Directors like Janathan Demme  Francis Coppolla who are the real achievers capable to create great Movies from books. The Plot of the Movie is very short. Its about an English Diplomat played by Ralph Fiennes working in UK High Commission in Kenya  his wife played by Rachel Weisz who is an AIDs awareness activists. Rachel seems to have cracked open a conspiracy involving some Pharmaceutical company UK external affair ministers  Kenyan Health Ministry who all inturn are attempting a deadly trials of a T.B. Drug on Kenyan poor community. Rachel is murdered and soon Ralph who was unaware about the scam is on his journey to nab down those responsible. The plot seems to be promising. But to one's disappointment there is no substance even in the postmurder investigation by Ralph. The Movie wins only in One aspect which is Cinematography. Its Awesome. The Last scene in Sudan is shot brilliantly. But the Deja Vu factor persists till the End. The Nude scene was totally unnecessary. One feel questioned about what the film makers are trying to do ? Does some nude scenes shot by shaky hand held camera adds up value ? Was it why The English Patient won an Oscar ? Are those irrelevant lenghtening  boring scenes deliberately planted to mold a better quality movie ? So finally a small plot is stretched too much that the out come is a boring life less flick which was trying to attempt itself to be an Epic Saga.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Constant Gardner is a conspiracy story set mostly in Kenya. The story starts near its end as Justin Quayle sees his wife Tessa and Arnold Bluhm her friend and associate depart on a flight to the Kenyan outback. Shortly thereafter Quayle is notified that Tessa and Arnold have died when their SUV overturns foul play is suspected as they say. In his mind Justin recalls events leading to Tessa' death to determine if she was murdered. We learn that Justin is a relatively clueless second generation British Foreign Service professional when he meets Tessa just a year earlier. Tessa an outspoken activist sees evil hiding behind corporations and government agencies she quickly seduces romances and marries Justin. Their transfer to Africa provides her with a fertile hunting ground. Tessa becomes involved with Arnold a United Nations associate working with Aids treatment programs. She immediately suspects the big pharmaceutical companies may be using unsuspecting natives for more than Aids research. Being what she is Tessa starts turning over stones writing reports and involving professional activists over the Internet not good behavior for a Foreign Service wife. The entire British Foreign Service establishment is not asleep at the wheel Sandy Woodrow the local representative and Sir Bernard in London take notice of Tessa's activity. Was her death in vain? The Constant Gardner is adapted from a John LaCarre novel. In his classic style it's told through the protagonist's minds eye flashbacks and has little live dialogue. This is a film without a screenplay and a foreign intrigue story without a mystery. The film opens at midpoint in the story with neither context setting nor character development as an introduction. The viewer must sort out the characters storyline and plot in piecemeal fashion within the flashback sequences. The plot or conspiracy in this case is quickly apparent since it's stated early and often with increasing emphasis as the story progresses. Not even a Louisiana politician could misinterpret the message. The story is told incrementally as repetitive flashbacks and recollections add pieces to the puzzle. This turns the 2hours runtime into an interminable evening.The Constant Gardner is being praised as one of the better films of the summer 2005 cinema season. This assertion unwittingly speaks volumes about the quality of big screen entertainment. The film is not totally without merit Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz are perfectly cast and deliver credible performances. Fiennes is the quintessential LaCarre protagonist selfcentered contemplative and enigmatic he lives life as a mental not a physical exercise. Rachel Weisz projects a powerful presence and fills a big screen in all dimensions this is an activist who will not be stopped. Finally if you're suspicious of public institutions and believe that nuclear medicine vaccines antibiotics electronic imaging and cardiovascular replacement parts grow on trees this is the conspiracy film you've been waiting for all your life.".

	schema:reviewBody "The constant gardener has it easy. It picks an emotionally charged subject matter and involves issues that are at the forefront of the political agenda. It has to be easier to make a film that has an impact on its audience from this starting point. It could have been genuinely awesome.However i felt that the film was totally one dimensional. For those that haven't seen it and this will in no way spoil the plot the central theme is large biotech companies in Africa. It is undeniable that such companies do exploit the poorer nations but it is likewise undeniable that if such companies didn't exist we would not possess the range of drugs that we do today. There is no question that these companies do some good. With such a rich subject matter an exploration of shades of grey of the debate could be the basis for an excellent film. Sadly the film fell firmly on the antibiotech side without any sort of fair trial. It is the lack of sophistication about the biotech  bad message that i objected to. Then as if the portrayal wasn't one sided enough anyone involved with either the British government or the biotech company was made a thoroughly unlikeable character in terms of personality.I don't mean to suggest that as a stand alone piece of work the film was bad. The fact is that by choosing a subject matter that is so emotive the filmmaker must take on certain responsibilities. In the case of the constant gardener i thought the complex issues were not explored at all. We've all seen brilliant movies that balance both sides of a debate exploring both the hero's and the villain's motivations and justifying both to us. The constant gardener does not do this and i believe is a worse movie for it.".

Naturally anyone who threatens to expose the drug companies is simply offed by their army of hired thugs.

Anyone who occasionally reads a book or newspaper knows that drugs are expensively and exhaustively tested for safety and that blunders are both rare and ruinous for the drug companies. Any drug company that wishes to turn a profit will NOT do so by developing a drug that kills people. Finally if drug companies really murdered those who criticize them or sue them then why is there no shortage of plaintiffs ready to take them to court? And why are the people who made this movie walking around without body guards? Of course the reason is that the plot is a paranoid fantasy.

	schema:reviewBody "One of 2005 most disappointing films. Brazilian director Fernando Meirelles had made before the great gangster film Cidade do Deus about the brutal life in the slums of Rio de Janeiro. So expectations were high for his second film. Alas he choose as its material a recent novel by John Le Carre an exciting writer of spy novels in the 60s and 70s but someone who has since the 90s been very disappointing in his work turning the moral ambiguity of his earlier books into shrill indictments of the West in his later ones not that he does not have a few points here and there in those books. So from this unpromising material Meirelles has made a truly awful movie. Basically the plot is about a timid British diplomat Ralph Fiennes trying to solve the murder of his activist wife in Kenya Rachel Weisz playing an insufferably smug individual. Fiennes character eventually finds that she was on the track of evil western pharmaceutical companies testing new drugs on African patients without obtaining their fully informed consent  not Africa's most pressing issue. What is most disturbing about this movie though is that Africans are basically used as props useful for the filmmakers to show their superior moral status over other whites. Africans are at most exotic objects here not subjects of their own lives. You never get to hear their own voices in this film.".

The Constant Gardener is a visually alive emotionally moving film not as ferocious as City of God but thoughtprovoking nonetheless.Personally I found Mr. Meirelles focused curious not at all jaded  cynical downtoearth warm and compassionate. He conducted a QA after the screening of The Constant Gardener in Washington DC last night. At the postscreening reception Mr. Meirelles graciously made himself accessible to all attendees.

	schema:reviewBody "The murder of a diplomat's wife under mysterious circumstances is the crux of John LeCarre's complex political thriller THE CONSTANT GARDENER. While thematically this type of story has been filmed before it's not concerned so much as to who did it or why even though these elements remain as important as ever throughout the plot but the gradual revelation of a woman whose story is told after her death through flashbacks pieces of previous conversations and recollections.Such a woman is Tessa Rachel Weiszwho while being an aggressive activist and a vocal force to be reckoned with is as mysterious as the people behind the wheel whom she encounters while on stay in Kenya. It's completely believable for a man like Justin Quayle Ralph Fiennes a diplomat and all about control to fall for her. She has that vibrant energy that complements his quieter nature and even when he discloses an email that could jeopardize their marriage he remains devoted to her where any other man would have initiated some form of argument.So when her murder occurs  right at the beginning of the movie  Justin realizes how little her knew of her. The deeper he gets into unveiling who killed her the clearer this picture becomes but it fails to answer any questions except the lingering thought that she was trying to disclose something nasty in the medical department but was stopped. He even recalls a moment when she pointed out to him right after her miscarriage that another mother was being systematically murdered by the medics attending her as she nursed her baby. Justin takes some time to understand but by the time he does come to he's neck deep in murky waters.I will admit that like Justin it took me a while to get into the meat of the story. Political thrillers have a way of meandering about hinting at a lot of things while incorporating the main idea that can make them a little difficult to get at first shot. Like SYRIANA THE CONSTANT GARDENER has numerous agendas that support each other as they wield an increasing pressure on Justin and like such offer no easy answers or an easy way out. Pete Postlethwaite's character's very presence late in the film and in the moment Tessa realizes the baby's mother is being murdered with untested drugs suggests he is only another player in a chess game where powers demand results and human lives are expendable if their drugs will eventually surface as the ones of choice.I enjoyed the ambiguousness which lay throughout the movie. Danny Huston and Bill Nighy come through as people without souls who are all about their positions. Both have incredible scenes of hypocritical restraint with Fiennes as if they knew a huge secret that they wouldn't tell and were urging Fiennes to stay away from further probing. The cinematography and editing as well is excellent in capturing just how big this conspiracy plot it and how weak we are in stopping it. At the same time muted colors dominate throughout  Justin's life is essentially over  and only come alive whenever Tessa comes on screen. Even so their very brightness seems to be an illusion because despite the fact that love does triumph if in Justin's devotion to Tessa corporations remain the same even after a crucial denouement involving a damning letter. A movie that should be seen several times to grasp its meaning THE CONSTANT GARDENER is a thriller with a heart and a strong voice.".

The film starts out in a satirical vein promising to deliver a nifty spoof of life in the friendly skies.  Instead it settles into a typical romantic comedy formula not bad as these things go but nothing to write home about either.  So while View from the Top' never soars very high neither does it end up crashing and burning.  In this day and age one must be grateful for a safe landing even if the ride is a bumpy one.Gwyneth Paltrow delivers a winning performance as Donna a small town girl who becomes a stewardess as a way of escaping her dysfunctional family and white trash upbringing.  The first part of the film is fun as Donna earns her wings flying for a cutrate airline whose attendants dress and act more like prostitutes than stewardesses.  With their formfitting cleavageexposing blouses purple hot pants and big hair these pleasantly perky hostesses look like they're ready to serve their passengers more than just the customary coffee tea or milk.  So far so good  but once the girls move onto a more legitimate' airline much of the satiric bite drains out of the film and we move onto the more familiar terrain of catty rivalries long distance romance and unrequited love.In addition to Paltrow the movie features Christina Applegate Rob Lowe Candice Bergen and Mark Ruffalo in various roles.  Mike Myers is surprisingly annoying in the part of a crosseyed stewardess trainer. The screenplay by Eric Wald has a maddening tendency to drop characters along the way giving the film a slapdash unformed and oddly amateurish quality. As partial compensation the film boasts superb production and costume design and a generally ebullient spirit.View From the Top' doesn't end up flying us anywhere special and it's definitely coach all the way but it does serve up a few laughs in mid flight.".

	schema:reviewBody "Here's where being a film critic is tricky. This movie isn't really bad it's actually worth seeing in some senses. It's less than 90 minutes long which is a safe bet for a comedy. But it fails to deliver any laughs it stumbles in its course and has some major flaws. As a film critic my assignment is to tell the readers my humble opinion of whether a film is worth paying to see. In that regard no View from the Top is not recommended by me. I didn't even really enjoy it that much. It delivers nothing fresh. But I never checked my watch I never felt like doing something else with my time. It is a harmless film a goodnatured sappy onelaugh movie that isn't as clever as it thinks it is but still manages to be sublimely interesting in an odd fashion. It kept me interested although there may be a difference between interested and entertained.View from the Top has been in what filmmakers call production hell for quite some time. It finally was released only to bomb at the box office. I don't blame the public for ignoring it. It's sad to think that the funniest thing about View from the Top is that Mike Myers' costar role as a weirdo airline employee is the highlight of the movie. Myers' cameo may be selfindulgent but not nearly as much so as Adam Sandler's in The Hot Chick. In fact without Mike Myers I would have given this movie an even lesser rating.The movie is about airline stewardesses and their way to the top. This sounds like a dull subject because it is. This can hardly be stretched out into a long movie without becoming repetitive. But in a sense it isn't clichd  there are no evil characters bent on the heroine's destruction there aren't any sexually suggestive pilots hitting on the heroine. It's just a story about a woman trying to make it to the top. It will probably inspire and enthrall the younger crowds but leave older audiences unsure.The film stars Gwyneth Paltrow as Donna Jensen a smalltown girl who dreams of leaving her country home and moving out into the real world. After reading an inspirational book about a flight stewardess who made her way to the top Donna leaves home and joins a lowkey airline service. Rob Lowe makes a cameo as the pilot but then disappears for the rest of the film. With the ads for the movie you'd think he's a main character.Donna meets up with Shelly Kelly Preston and another young stewardess played by Christina Applegate. They decide to join Royalty Airlines but Donna's test results are switched and she ends up being turned down for a job at the airline by Frank Whitney Mike Myers who has a funny eye that turns inwards and in order to read he must go through crazy guestures.This movie has sweet performances and sweet intentions and comes off the way it wants to  sweet  but I can't bring myself to fully recommend you pay to see it. View from the Top isn't a particularly fine movie. It's watchable fluff and the techniques the film use are not as clichd as something like Legally Blonde. But in the end I realized I had barely laughed at anything. Perhaps clichs aren't always the things to avoid.2.55 stars".

The movie struggles to even fill its 87 minutes with substance. Basically just girl from small town longing for high life and glamour trials and tribulations achieving her goals and final realization that love and home are really what cranks. My my original indeed.Yes Gwyneth is OK not totally sleepwalking through this role. She obviously needs to be stretched artistically though. The supporting cast don't provide much. Mike Myers' cross eyed instructor provides a few laughs but seems mostly like an overplayed Saturday Night Live character.Candice Bergen seems settled into these timekiller comedies and that is her prerogative. As the grand damme of flight attendants she does get a couple of humorous lines and her lispy stilted staccato deliberate vocal delivery is always funny to me.510 because I did laugh a few times.

Then there is the strange cameo by Rob Lowe which leaves an impression that it was meant to be more than just a cameo... but it ended up being a loose end. And there is a strangely inconsistent accent by Gwyneth Paltrow who usually gets it right Sliding Doors comes to mind so that leads me to believe that there was some serious amount of reshooting which made for those inconsistencies...Even with all that the film comes loaded with good laughs my favorite being scenes with Mike Myers who just nailed his role but I understand that haters gonna hate and even Gwyneth's reactions to his lunacy are priceless.So if you are expecting a terrific plot that would make Hitchcock jealous move on this is not that type of film. But if you are in for some guilty pleasure of silly laughs with some seriously good acting by the main actors Gwyneth Paltrow Mike Myers and Christina Applegate were all great then you have come to the right place.This film is really not as bad as people are making it to be. There is nothing wrong with using actresses good looks to make a funny film especially when the film has no pretenses at being another Seventh Seal. If anything we need more joy and fun in this world and this film provides plenty of that.p.s. Watch this film carefully there are plenty of jokes that would be easy to miss if you are too busy eating popcorn.p.p.s. BTW Christina Applegate just proved again what a terrific actress she is!

	schema:reviewBody "Word on the Net is that Ms Paltrow does not consider this one to be her crowning glory. Well if this was her biggest mistake then a fine life she has lead cause this can't be that hard to live with. Might I be allowed to dwell on mentioning that Gwyneth looks scrumptious in a skimpy bikini that according to the script is about to fall down but sadly doesn't. Nice legs hot body and ooh the hair! I loved the hair! But not the overly sophisticated 40 haircut when she went International but the long loose hair of the romantic scenes. By the way I'm sure Mark Ruffalo can only sigh when he remembers he once held Gwyneth Paltrow in his arms.  There is some excellent casting done in this movie but none more so than that lovely little girl at the beginning of the movie Chelsey Cole. She instantly gave the film a warm feel and she fit in wonderfully and I would like to believe that's exactly what a beautiful creature like Ms Paltrow looked like when she was a kid. Both Mike Meyers and Candice Bergen were great as well but the fun casting was Christina Applegate yeah baby!The second half of this picture loses height like a DC3 with a burning starboard engine. Somebody up there in the wild blue yonder should have realized that us little folk down here would enjoy the 'big hair short skirts big smiles flying gamblers and drunks' bit a whole lot more and the movie could rather have been about a seatof their pants airline much like that forgotten old TV series FLY BY NIGHT. Rob Lowe would have been an excellent choice for that. Instead as she realizes her ultimate dream the whole look becomes boring yawn worthy. But all is not lost. She realizes her mistake and the fox is soon totally hot again. That cockpit wink at the end of the movie has got to go down in cinematic history.Great music too by wonderful vibrant sexyvoiced talent including LeAnn Rimes that really gives sparkle to the movie. That one two three bit during the plane liftoff scene was 100 perfect.So Gwyneth is ashamed of having appeared in this one? Why my dear this was such a great showcase for your beauty and charm. Don't worry we know you are a serious actress and this is just something much less creepy to remember you by than that one where your head ended up in a hatbox!".

Well if this was her biggest mistake then a fine life she has lead cause this can't be that hard to live with. Might I be allowed to dwell on mentioning that Gwyneth looks scrumptious in a skimpy bikini that according to the script is about to fall down but sadly doesn't. Nice legs hot body and ooh the hair! I loved the hair! But not the overly sophisticated 40 haircut when she went International but the long loose hair of the romantic scenes. By the way I'm sure Mark Ruffalo can only sigh when he remembers he once held Gwyneth Paltrow in his arms.

Beginning with the acting Gwynneth Paltrow sleepwalks through this one like no actor I have ever seen. The one thing she displayed in this putrid mess was spectacular posture. Her dialog lacked life which was largely due to it's laughable nature. Her attempts at physical comedy were so amateurish that I began to wonder if the whole thing was a spoof. Christina Appelgate couldn't have been worse if she were deceased. Candice Bergen tried desperately to reprise her Miss Congeniality role even though her character was written without any personal depth. Even the likable Mark Ruffalo came off poorly when confronted with the terrible direction and revolting writing that backed this travesty. When Mike Myers provides the best performance in your movie you know you are in trouble.I watched the movie alone and I asked myself aloud if this were the unfunniest comedy I had ever seen or the least moving drama. That is the movie was so bad I was talking to myself. The story of a small town resident trying to get away has been done so frequently that undertaking it again requires something special. A View From the Top lacked that something. The nadir occurs when Appelgate and Paltrow fight in the galley of an otherwise empty plane spilling peanuts and drink carts along the way. Maybe that sounds amusing but when you see the actresses looking for things to knock over you know you are in the midst of a bad dream. Actually check that. The nadir occurs when several of the students including our heroine first go to Sally Westin's Bergen house for dinner and we are subjected to a stream of jokes surrounding the homosexuality of Randy Jones Josh Molina that are at best unfunny and at worst offensively homophobic.Before I get myself worked up any more over this let me just say stay away from this film.".

Charlie and his daughter Joleen are on their way home from a cross country vacation when they run out of gas in Banco Nevada a small town located in a remote part of the desert. It's one day before Jolene's 14th birthday. Charlie and Joleen check a nearby gas station owned by a Vietnam war veteran named Duckett but Duckett doesn't have any gas so they head to the local supermarket to find a phone. Sheriff Bill Childers is in the store and he advises them to go to the trailer park to ask for gas. Joleen spots the body of the store's owner Ferrell Hogus in a pool of blood. The Sheriff states that the murderer is most likely a drifter. The man and daughter check into the nearby Palomino Guest Ranch and Trailer Park which is owned by a hostile woman named Agnes Reed. Whilst her father uses the phone Joleen speaks to Agnes's rebellious teenage son Jimmy Reed who she briefly came into contact with earlier at the gas ...";

Although it was interesting and fun it just lacks something that would make it a classic. Drew Barrymore as always shines in this movie as the film's heroine and Andreas Jones is perfect as the charming yet creepy young man who catches the eye of young Barrymore. I recommend it for someone who is a Drew fan or a fan of cheap horror films. Other than that don't expect much.".

Unfortunately they are stranded in the depths of the Nevada desert without any gas for their car and end up sheltering at a trailer park run by a wicked woman with two very strange children. One is a dark and mysterious boy whom Barrymore's character grows interested in however is warned by more than just her father to stay away from him.The film may be too slow for some but I thought it was alright. I was able to watch it all the way through which is more than I can say for a lot of films. This being the type that it is really isn't all that bad and if you're a big Drew Barrymore fan you should check it out.

	schema:reviewBody "Matt Frewer and Drew Barrymore plus 1989 Jennifer Tilly  and Susan Tyrrell too? Gotta see this!I liked the first half or so of this one pretty well. It jumps right into the quintessential creepy small town in the middle of nowhere right off the bat but we quickly discover that the people here are tongueincheek stereotypes and give us some surprising laughs. So we have a movie that's a cross between a dark comedy and a lowbudget suspensehorror movie. Oh plus jailbait Drew in a 2piece and other skimpy clothes. She's an adult now so... that makes it OK... right???!? Eek.Anyway among others Susan acquired taste Tyrrell is in fine form here she made me laugh out loud several times. I think the director was having some fun in a few of her scenes. I know I was! The whole cast does fine. In most ways the movie is competentlyenough made. There are some good moments here. However in the end the quirky mix of horror and dark comedy which starts us off with such promise loses out to a traditional horror third act leaving the comedy out. I felt that the movie let me down at that stage.It's still a watchable movie but it misses being a great movie at least for a B movie by changing formula horses in midstream. As a result I can only give it a 5.For the record I hope Hollywood can let kids be kids and not sexualize 13yearolds in the future. As much as I roll my eyes when a 23yearold plays a high schooler there is something worse and that's putting a kid in front of a camera and inviting us to view her as a sex object. Drew played this role well and she seems to have grown into a really attractive and healthy adult lately so I guess there's no reason to go on a warpath over this now. Still I was uncomfortable watching some of these scenes. Yes she had a great body but she was 13 or maybe 14! Come on.In spite of the flaws if you like offbeat movies or Drew Barrymore you will probably find this worth watching especially prior to the third act.".

	onyx:emotionText "Matt Frewer and Drew Barrymore plus 1989 Jennifer Tilly  and Susan Tyrrell too? Gotta see this!I liked the first half or so of this one pretty well. It jumps right into the quintessential creepy small town in the middle of nowhere right off the bat but we quickly discover that the people here are tongueincheek stereotypes and give us some surprising laughs. So we have a movie that's a cross between a dark comedy and a lowbudget suspensehorror movie. Oh plus jailbait Drew in a 2piece and other skimpy clothes. She's an adult now so... that makes it OK... right???!? Eek.Anyway among others Susan acquired taste Tyrrell is in fine form here she made me laugh out loud several times. I think the director was having some fun in a few of her scenes. I know I was! The whole cast does fine. In most ways the movie is competentlyenough made. There are some good moments here. However in the end the quirky mix of horror and dark comedy which starts us off with such promise loses out to a traditional horror third act leaving the comedy out. I felt that the movie let me down at that stage.It's still a watchable movie but it misses being a great movie at least for a B movie by changing formula horses in midstream.

Here they meet the local residents chief among them two boys who take an interest in Joleen. Andras Jones A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 The Dream Master is the punkish Jimmy Reed son of landlord Agnes Reed the legendary Susan Tyrrell. Anthony Rapp Adventures in Babysitting is the more sensitive well meaning Pinky Sears. Unfortunately one of them just might be psychotic enough to kill people.The script by Tommy Lee Wallace longtime John Carpenter associate who directed Halloween III Season of the Witch is much too routine and very predictable. Viewers may also feel uncomfortable with the cameras' ogling of Drew at any and every opportunity. However while the story may be too trite to work all that well director Meiert Avis takes full advantage of the rural settings. He and his capable crew including cinematographer Paul Elliott and production designer Victoria Paul milk these settings for as much atmosphere as possible. So Far from Home is at least successful enough on a visual level. It might disappoint people expecting more of a slasher film and a higher body count but it does get fairly gory on occasion.One good thing is that these filmmakers do make some nice casting choices. Drew does alright in the central role possessing a natural likability and vulnerability as well as the expected resentment towards her paternal figure well played by Frewer. He's good as the kind of father that means well but can still be seen as annoying. Richard Masur is wonderful as Duckett a latterday hippie kind of character. Jennifer Tilly is decent and as sexy as ever as Amy who for whatever reason shares a trailer with another local Louise lovely Karen Austin. Jones and Rapp are both good. Tyrrell is a real force of nature during her time on screen. The always welcome Dick Miller plays the Sheriff and John Spencer can be glimpsed on a TV monitor.An adequate B movie at best watchable but also forgettable.Five out of 10.".

Richard Masur another bad movie staple Anyone have his classic Fallen Angel? I do.. There are so many bad lines it's a must see even if just for the narration another bad movie must. I felt bad for Jennifer getting stuck in a tiny car that couldn't have more than a couple gallons of gas in it when it explodes like a 3 megaton bomb hit it.

Max Headroom as the dad remember he and Jennifer are the same age so he would have been 17 when Drew was born and Susan Tyrell a queen of rotten movies. The megahot Jennifer Tilly looking great here. Richard Masur another bad movie staple Anyone have his classic Fallen Angel? I do.. There are so many bad lines it's a must see even if just for the narration another bad movie must. I felt bad for Jennifer getting stuck in a tiny car that couldn't have more than a couple gallons of gas in it when it explodes like a 3 megaton bomb hit it. Drew does look great at 14 and could really fill out a swimsuit top That lucky Letterman!. I could just imagine Mike and the bots doing commentary for this one!";

This could be a tense slasher thriller but the movie plays up the jailbait element at every turn. It's a bit awkward. It would be so much more appealing for her to be a little reserved and play up more of the innocence. She's a very compelling actress and it would make Jimmy Reed more threatening. The music cues for Jimmy get a bit annoying. The Reeds are so over the top that it borders on camp. The narration is mostly unnecessary the title is too weak and the twist is too obvious.

The only reason films that produced multiple sequels raked in the dough was the films were cheaply made low overhead means more potential for a profit. When you pour millions into a movie and expect to make a buck two out of three times you're going to lose your shirt. The movie has a rushed into production feel. I felt the same way after watching Scary Movie 2. The director was given what he had to work with. I can't fault Walter Hill because he made a pretty watchable movie. The problem was this film didn't need a sequel. The end results are a remake of the first movie. No more no less. This film was made during the peak of Eddie Murphy's over exposure period. Like so many actors he was a victim of his own excess. Nick Nolte seemed to be going through the motions whilst Eddie Murphy had that look at me thing going.Overall it's not a bad movie.

Hill Street Blues characters didn't change that much either yet it stayed entertaining. I thoroughly enjoyed this film. The acting is of a very high quality and so are some of the action scenes. And there is a twist in the film I didn't see coming. So all in all not a classic yet highly entertaining and that is what it was supposed to do.";

	schema:reviewBody "Another 48 Hrs. feels like a missed opportunity it feels as if the makers have recognised the potential of the idea and have done half a job. This is because it never really elevates itself above the material it actually is. At a time when the Lethal Weapon films had proved there was a demand for white cop with black sidekick buddy combination type films Another 48 Hrs. is perhaps a cash in sequel to a film that was never anything special any way. Where as it sounds like I'm being negative the film was enjoyable for what it was and that said I would have a hard time in deciding which one I liked more.A scene from this film which typically sums up the genre the film is working under highlights not only the genres inability to ever be anything above a certain level but also the problem films face when they age. The film is a crime film a buddy combination of two people getting involved in shoot outs and general criminal activity whilst battling each others egos. In 1994 when Pulp Fiction came out films like Another 48 Hrs. were history and a particular scene is defining evidence shortly after a prison bus has rolled over a few times two hells angels are going to kill someone on board. But what happens is instead of riding up to the overturned bus and finishing the job they park their bikes a few hundred yards away get off very slowly and walk up to the bus with the intent to kill. Now there is absolutely no reason for them to do this apart from add suspense to the scene and perhaps have two bikers walk in tandem in slow motion amongst the heat wave in a 'cool' fashion. This is the point films such as these rely on what would look good cinematically rather than stick to what their characters would do.I know it's wrong to compare a film to another film made after it but this highlights not only the bad way in which Another 48 Hrs. has aged but further cements what a great film Pulp Fiction really is the buddy combination in that film of Jules and Vincent who are by no coincidence black and white but Tarantino plays with realism in the film and the scene in which someone is accidentally shot in the back of the car is so much more clear in the sense it is two fingers up to scenes like the one just mentioned in Another 48 Hrs. The film starts off with Reggie Murphy still in prison and shows up its other half of the buddy combination as a bit of an idiot. Another 48 Hrs. suffers from its clich that its best cop on the force Jack Nolte is actually a loose cannon whom needs to be removed even though the job is actually perfect for him an idea toyed with in the third Die Hard film but with John McLane. Jack seems certain that an antagonist known as The Iceman is at large but is demeaned and shown up as perhaps a bit of a schizophrenic one officer labelling this Iceman as an imaginary friendenemy who Jack has been pretending to chase.Unfortunately the initial incident in the film happens a little early by way of a shooting at a race track. What I couldn't understand is that with all those people watching the race nobody saw the bad guy shoot at Jack and consequently the police have their eye on him. Reggie on the other hand is out of jail and he miraculously survives an attack on a bus mentioned earlier as it rolls over several times something that would have killed him. But the film suffers from it lack of logic that can be applied to certain situations The bus rolls over the bikers aren't professional enough the back up arrives a too quickly and are unable to spot the bikers fleeing the bikers in other scenes get their guns out in full public view too many times but nobody ever seems to mind and generally there is an acute sense of frustration during these times. But the film backs itself up with a scene in a nightclub during which it makes a pastiche out of its predecessor by putting Jack in a punch up only for Reggie to save him by acting out his copno nonsense routine by threatening to shoot first and the ask questions later. Along with this Jack even makes reference to 'typical bar punch ups that you get in the movies' where he states someone always hits else someone over the head with a chair or a glass bottle. Jack then does exactly that with a bottle and the chair soon follows.But to me this is Another 48 Hrs. recognising that is knows what it is that it knows the formula its using and is having fun playing around with the clichs even if scenes such as the bus rolling and the bikers not doing what they should do by finishing the job. The film is by no means great or groundbreaking but I was never bored or put off by what I was seeing it may have lacked realism and been since pushed down a peg in the crime genre hierarchy by bigger and better films but it remains entertaining to a degree with gunshots powerful enough to propel people through windows and cops smart enough to wear bullet proof vests whilst off duty. Another 48 Hrs. is by no means a big winner but it is by no means a massive loser even if it may indeed look like that in another twenty years.".

Nick and Eddie still had awesome chemistry and the film is constantly entertaining it's just it's nowhere close to being as good as the original and felt they could have done a bit more new material. I enjoyed this movie quite a bit however it can't match the original. The Direction is good. Walter Hill does a good job here nothing special but he kept the film at a fast pace! good job. There is a bit of blood. We get lots of pretty bloody gunshot wounds but that's it. The Acting is very good. Nick Nolte is fantastic once again he had awesome chemistry with Eddie Murphy was likablekicked that ass and was lots of fun to watch!. Eddie Murphy is AMAZING as always and is just plain hilarioushowever both of them seemed to be going through the motions at times still they gave it there all and they were both great plus Eddie gets to show off his comedic talent more! Eddie Rules!. Brion James is good herebut didn't have enough screen time.Andrew Divoff is great as the main villain and was very menacing. Ed O'Ross is also good with his limited screen time.

	schema:reviewBody "The Movie begins with a meeting of a few bikers. Then a some cops arrive and get killed. who could have guessed. Then you see a racetrack where some moneyexchange is taking place. After a shootout between a guy and Jack Cates Nick Nolte. There is a little explosion but they don't find the other guys gun. So Jack is in big problems because he is likely to be charged with manslaughter. Jack visits Reggie Eddie Murphy in prison and tells him that he only gets his money which Jack stored for him if he helps him. Reggie gets really mad. BTW Reggie says he was in prison for 7 years which gets explained later. Because in Part 1 they always talked about I think just a few like 2 or so but don't hold me to that years. Oh and on of the bikers who are supposed to kill Reggie is the brother of the bad guy in the first movie. Well Reggie gets out of the Prison and is on his bus. while that happens there is an attempt on Jack's Life. Because he is on the search for a ominous Drugdealer called The Iceman. BTW I missed something before Reggie was in his cell alone and singing to his James Brown tape. Looks exactly as it did in Part one. When the movie came out I read that this Scene was put in to compensate Eddie Murphies Wishes. But it was funny one time. The second time it looks kinda out of place.. All that happens in the first 10 minutes of the movie. So you can imagine that there is a lot of action in this movie. After a while they get to be good buddies during the movie again. It's very similar to the first movie. And a lot of scenes are kind of just copied from the first one I mean storywise Since Walter Hill had 8 Years to come up with a new and entertaining and sometimes funny story. But the movie just hasn't the charm of the first movie. Though if you enjoy either Eddie Murphy or Nick Nolte You'll like it I will not spoil the rest of the movie for you if you haven't seen it yet and tell you who the iceman is. Now it get's explained why Reggie was in the Can longer. He was framed for illegal money possession in Jail. Since Jack doesn't give Reggie his Money they have to work together and Reggie isn't happy about it. Nobody from the Force believes Jack about the Iceman... Well the story develops as you might think.. They go through a lot and become good buddies again. I am watching the Movie right now. The revelation who the Iceman is that is the only real surprise in this movie the rest is real predictable. Well it's a typical Buddie Movie as they did back then like from the middle 80ties to the beginning of the nineties... like the first Lethal Weapon Movie. First the two don't like each other and during the movie they become best friends.It's sad that they for the most part don't make 'em like this anymore.. If you like these kinds of movies you will like this one.. I like them from back when they were new so I still do. But if you are used to Movie like they make 'em today  I really don't know if you will enjoy it. But it is a pretty good movie. Watch it and decide for yourself. And if you haven't seen Part 1 48 Hours get that one too. O.K. I will watch the rest of the movie now and enjoy myself. One last thing I really think the movie is worth 7 out of 10 points.".

When Murphy and Nolte are not onscreen the film is rather boring. This can be credited to the fact that Nolte and Murphy are so fun to watch that you don't care at all about the rest of characters. Fortunately Nolte and Murphy are onscreen more than 90 of the time.".

I wonder how many old buses they trashed to get that sequence just right? Much like the car chase in Bullitt its the part you remember years after you've forgotten the plot of the film.Nick Nolte is excellent as the tough but rather dumb cop commuting between mayhem zones in his tired and much abused Cadillac convertible. Most of the westernstyle action takes place in sleazebag honkytonks and a brothel. Quite effective.Excellent action throughout but the brokenglass festival at the end is a little overdone. The fake streetcars are very unprofessional. Why spend so much money and effort on some scenes and then blow it on basic glitches like that? Movie audiences DO notice that sort of thing just like airplane vapor trails in Westerns so stay on the ball Hollywood.Speaking of balls my favorite scene in this film is the one where Eddie Murphy gets the drop on Nick Nolte with a basketball ! Either Nolte is a very good actor or he really didn't know it was coming. Maybe both. Try doing 20 takes of that scene sometime.Perennial villain Ed O'Ross Red Heat Universal Soldier is in there as one of the bad cops and duly gets drilled in the finale. Has Ed O'Ross EVER been in a film where he didn't meet a violent end ? The problem is that as soon as you see him you just know that he's going to be one of the heels. I liked this film and it still holds it own pretty well today for a new generation of viewers despite the autos and clothes now starting to look a little dated.R. B.".

If the above was true Murphy is not the one to blame for the movies failure. 'Another 48 Hours' offers no surprises originality and a plot that has been recycled over and over again.Cowritten by the director of the first installment Walter Hill who had years to come up with something good gives the fans of the original a HUGE letdown. The opening scene has three bikers cruising all over the country blowing innocent people away and apparently they work for a major drug dealer known as Iceman that Jack Cates Nick Noltehas been trying to track down for years. The Iceman wants Reggie Hammond Eddie Murphy dead for reasons that go unexplained throughout most of the movie.Cates job goes on the line when he kills a suspect who's gun cannot be found after the shooting. The suspect is burned to a crisp in a gasoline fire but the one important clue is unbelievably sparred.So Cate calls on Murphy to assist in saving the day and while the chemistry between the two was so good in the original '48 Hours' something is now wrong. Nolte and Murphy don't seem to be enjoying themselves. They are not having fun. And either am I.The routine plot becomes more routine as the writers seem to know that the movie is not funny and try their best to distract the audience with endless car chases shootouts and the likes. One unintentional laugh I got was watching a bus roll over a dozen times at 50 miles an hour with Murphy in it but later seeing him walk away without a scratch. And the so called surprise when the identity of the Iceman is revealed is about as believable as Frosty The Snowman. Perhaps the Iceman would be a better bad guy in Spider Man 3.Eddie come back to us. We miss you.".

So while I was renting some movies I decided to see the sequel Another 48 Hrs. I was curious where they would take the story and if Eddie Murphy still had it. Unfortunately this is where Eddie's career was going down hill and Nick Nolte's was doing just fine. The only problem I had with this film is that it seemed like it was just an attempt to get more money it was still a fun sequel though it's definitely worth a look. Even though it was predictable but once you've seen a lot of action movies you've almost seen them all you know? But Another 48 Hrs. has comedy action and our favorite team back. Eddie Murphy could have been funnier but it's all good with this action packed sequel.Jack is back and he's fighting a criminal named the Iceman who just keeps disappearing before he can get to him. It's getting so bad that Jack will loose his job over this and possibly go to jail for missing money that he's been accused of taking. He needs the street smart Reggie once again who is in jail still for a crime he claims he didn't commit. But it's hard when they are fighting since Jack hasn't visited Reggie in a while but they work together to find the Iceman but they discover that one of the men that works with Jack just might be a bad cop.Anothre 48 Hrs. is fun but I think it could have had more comedy. But like I said unfortunately Eddie Murphy's career was going down hill at the point where this sequel was made. But I loved the scene where Jack gets into a bar fight and Reggie has to help him out I loved how he was pointing the gun at one of the fighters and the guy calls Reggie's bluff with the gun but Reggie shoots his knee to prove to him. Unrealistic but funny on Eddie Murphy's part. Another 48 Hrs. is worth a look it has really cool action scenes and all in all it's a good action movie. Let's just hope that Eddie's ego will calm down hopefully he'll get more good roles in the future.510".

But it's hard when they are fighting since Jack hasn't visited Reggie in a while but they work together to find the Iceman but they discover that one of the men that works with Jack just might be a bad cop.Anothre 48 Hrs. is fun but I think it could have had more comedy. But like I said unfortunately Eddie Murphy's career was going down hill at the point where this sequel was made. But I loved the scene where Jack gets into a bar fight and Reggie has to help him out I loved how he was pointing the gun at one of the fighters and the guy calls Reggie's bluff with the gun but Reggie shoots his knee to prove to him. Unrealistic but funny on Eddie Murphy's part. Another 48 Hrs. is worth a look it has really cool action scenes and all in all it's a good action movie. Let's just hope that Eddie's ego will calm down hopefully he'll get more good roles in the future.510";

Also the dialogue scene's with Nolte and Murphy are just as funny as the ones in the first.  I dont know why so many people think this is such a bad movie.

And while Another 48 Hrs is not as good as the originalthe film is still a solid sequel.Set seven years after the originalAnother 48 Hrs finds Jack CatesNick Noltetrying to track down and nail a drug lord named The Icemana drug dealer who has been operating in San Francisco. With nowhere to turnJack needs help once again from Reggie HammondEddie Murphywho's been in prison for five years and is about to get out. The only problem is that The Iceman wants Reggie dead. NowJack and Reggie have Another 48 Hrs to bring down The Iceman and with Jack and Reggie the boys are back in town with more laughs and thrills.Released in 1990Another 48 Hrs is an entertaining sequel that not only came out 8 years after the excellentlandmark ActionComedy classic 48 Hrs but also came out after the Box Office success of the first two Lethal Weapon films. While Another 48 Hrs was a Box Office successthe film received a mixed reaction from film critics who felt Another 48 Hrs was too much like the original and while this film isn't very creative or truly groundbreaking like the first film it's still a fun and thrilling movie that entertains you for 95 minutes. Another 48 Hrs is a good ActionComedy that pretty much taking what worked in the first movie and bringing it to this film mixing thrillingintense Action with hilarious Comedy that is nonstop from beginning to end. The Comedy and Humor in Another 48 Hrs. is funny and will make you laugh out loud because the Humor is very much in line with the first film showing how Jack and Reggie deal with each other while looking for The Iceman and getting into various situations that are funny with Eddie Murphy being the funny guy and Nick Nolte being the straight one. Although the Comedy in Another 48 Hrs is funnythe Humor sometimes lacks the edge and politically incorrect tone the first one had. If there is one thing that is different and bigger from the first 48 Hrs it's the Action scenes. The Action scenes in Another 48 Hrs are not only amazing but are bigger and louder than they were in the first film because director Walter Hillwho was given a much bigger budget with this filmgoes completely insane with the Action with each Action scene being more explosive than the last. Hill's Action scenes always feature people flying in the air or going through broken glass and while there is people flying in the airthere is more broken glass shattered in Another 48 Hrs than in any other Walter Hill film whether it's with windows or glass doors. There is enough Actiongunfightsexplosions and thrills in Another 48 to satisfy any Action film and Walter Fill fan. The main characters Jack Cates and Reggie Hammond show in this film that despite not seeing each other for seven neither one of them has changed since the last time they saw each other with the two still throwing funny jabs and insults at one another almost like they were never apart. Throughout the film we also see Jack and Reggie try to repair their friendship which has been strainedthe two haven't seen each other in seven yearsbut as the film goes on and the two work together their partnership and friendship grows despite the funny lines the two throw at each other and the chemistry is still there. The ending of Another 48 Hrs is great and filled with Actionexcitement and laughs and a twist you wont see coming at all. There is also a wonderful bit at the end that is a funny homage to the ending in the original film that will make you laugh. A great ending.The cast is terrific. Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte are excellent once again as Reggie Hammond and Jack Cateswith Murphy and Nolte displaying great laughs and chemistry. Brion James is great as KehoeCates' fellow cop and friend. Kevin Tighe is wonderful as Blake Wilsonan Internal Affairs cop that is on Jack's back. Ed O'Ross does a fine job as Frank Cruiseanother San Francisco Cop. David Anthony MarshallWillie HickokAndrew DivoffRichard 'Cherry Ganzand Ted MarklandMalcolm Priceare outstanding as the three murderous bikers. Bernie Casey is fantastic as Kirkland Smitha fellow convict that Reggie owes a debt to. Brent Jennings is sensational as Burroughsa man that works for The Iceman. Tisha CampbellAmy SmithPage LeongAngel Leeand Cathy HasseGirl Bartendergive good performances as well.The direction by Walter Hill is wonderfulwith Hill always moving the camera and keeping the film moving at a tight pace and Hill also does a great job with the Action scenes. Incredible directionHill.The score by James Horner is greatintense and matches the tone of the film. Fantastic scoreHorner. There is also the return of the classic song The Boys Are Back In Town by The Bus Boys and another version of the song by Jesse Johnson.In final wordif you love ActionComediesWalter HillEddie Murphy or Nick NolteI highly suggest you see Another 48 Hrs.a terrificActionpacked and funny ActionComedy that will keep you entertained.

So despite my feelings about the first 48 Hrs movie I must admit it was one godfather for the genre and a milestone in its time. It was the beginning of an era that lasted for nearly 2 decades after setting a specific formula where the Action thriller will be always with odd couple. So it's Abbott  Costello again yet in a world of madly violent bad guys madly violent good guys incessant swearing from everybody streets full of unstoppable car chases a sky that rains torrents of bullets huge explosions every 10 minutes police forces with only dirty cops and continuous sarcastic clashes between the 2 partners whoaregoingtoberealfriends !From the highest most popular franchises Lethal Weapon to Stakeout Men In Black Bad Boys reaching to Rush Hour.. with the decline of the whole matter ! It was maybe the golden age of the American action movie and definitely the golden age of the Buddyaction movie. So after 8 years of the first 48 Hrs it was some acme for its kind. For instance at the same year of 1990 you'd find another similar Buddies such as The Rookie and it was even the time to a BuddyCop spoof  Loose Cannons! So why not to make Another 48 Hrs.The intention here was clear  making a fierce image all the time with at least one explosion gunfire flying bus or man in every single scene and when director Walter Hill and his writing team find no such matters to put so they make the actor break the glass by his bare hand.. Just for the fun of it. Hence when its finale took place at a nightclub you'd catch on its real message it's about having a noisy good time anyway.This is unlike the original a downright crazy action. You'd never meet a girlfriend character or a longer than one page dialogue. That surely affected the comedy in a bad way though who said that this is a comedy? Even the first movie was anything but a comedy otherwise if you consider the numerous swearing a comic thing !.The main plot is openly just an excuse to blow up things but it managed to be good as whole. Along side being highly explosive I love that it enjoyed presenting a modern time old western outlaws making an actual confusion about who's the real iceman ? and spoofing itself smartly while the bar fight with Nolte saying  How clich !.But the writing didn't care much about rooting the 2 leads' relationship which is absolute crap when it comes to a flick like this before being something already had been done in the first one. Yet it got real weak points like the iceman's complicated plan to kill Murphy's character just because he saw him once! while it's something easier to be executed in jail more than doing it outside ?! Plus I felt that something didn't fit Eddie Murphy he has nothing funny to do but imitating James Brown rapidly and he got to say the same speech of having a bad day twice already at the hospital then at the bar!!??.The 2 leads look fatter than the first movie. They deliver especially to each other spiritlessly. James Horner uses his original catchy main theme yet the movie doesn't give him a space to say more. Walter Hill seems having a riotous good time I believe he wanted to pay a little homage to Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in The West at the slow kind of long opening titles in dusty desert with 3 killers gather to murder one man. And Although he managed to blast it at his full blast but I saw that the climax wasn't up to all what was before it of stronger action.For rare time the tagline speaks the truth  Here they go again. Only faster. And tougher. Am I add bigger and louder but not funny !P.S  At one moment of the movie Murphy's character says if the sht became with price these ones will be born without asses it's a line from Gabriel Garcia Marquez's novel The Autumn of the Patriarch !!

Nevertheless Jackie's cameo was a riot in the end. I never expected to see him in the film but 2 members of his Sing Ga Ban Bradley Allan Ken Lo made appearances.

This film is fitted for teens lots of loud techno music bright colors teenage themes and enough action to make even John Woo happy. The action is fast and furious. There are lots of gunfights explosions and fights. Produced by Jackie Chan himself this film knocks all those want to be teen action films Mod Squad out of the water. Anyone under 21 will enjoy this film a whole lot. And it also appeals to older action film fans. GenX Cops does what the titles say it's a teenage action thriller that is fully loaded.".

He's one of the few Hong Kong pop actors that are making a fine transition into acting than compared to some others IE. the horrible Ekin Cheng.  I saw this movie a few days ago and I have mix reactions to this movie.  This movie had a mixture of English Japanese and Cantonese. Oh this review is on both the dubbed and subtitled versions.First I'll go with the flaws.  The story was too Hollywood for me.  How many movies have we seen a group of criminals steal a nuclear bomb and it's up to the heroes to save the city from mass destruction?  Way too many times.  The dialogue was just so cliche.  For example after a criminal betrays his own boss for money It's about money right?  It's part of the game you know that!  Some of the actors are just really bad like Sam Lee's character Alien you swear you'll start to think this man has soon too many Jim Carrey movies.  Also there was too many episodic character developments like it jumped from a brother and brother to a cop and a criminal with morals a son of a criminal who wants revenge on another criminal...and so on.  Still with me?Now for the bright spots of the movie.  The action sequences are just kinetic!  Fast cuts people diving and shooting at the same time stand offs Kung Fu scenes and anything you can think of for a Hong Kong action movie.  The women in the movie are some good eye candy if you know what I'm saying.  Nicholas Tse does a good job not as good as he did in Time and Tide but since this is his earlier work you see his potential.  The actor who played Akatora was impressive even sometimes his thick Japanese accent would make you miss some of his English words. In the musical note there was this great Hong Kong punk song at the end of the credits that was pretty catchy.So even with mix reactions do I recommend this movie?  Well it depends.  If you're looking for a good popcorn movie this would be it.  If you're looking for a smart action movie that reminds you of a John Woo movie?  This wouldn't be it.  So whatever you choose just look for the amazing shootouts and a promising actor name Nicholas Tse.".

	schema:reviewBody "Note This review contains spoilers so it's probably best to read this after you've seen the movie.I stumbled upon GenX Cops 1999 while I was watching television on satellite. I read the plot summary and it sounded interesting. But unfortunately after I had finished watching the movie I was left disappointed. This is a weak and overlong action flick that is filled with clichs and it's a movie that seems to be set on autopilot. The movie also seems to take its ridiculous plot seriously as if we cared.The movie starts out well The Hong Kong Police are looking for 10 pounds of nuclear bombs which has been stolen by an Asian street gang led by Akatora Tru Nakamura. At the same time a deal is going down the Hong Kong police station is bombed.Inspector Chan Eric Tsang is a timid cop who is assigned to hire three teenage recruits Jack Nicholas Tse Match Stephen Fung and Alien Sam Lee to go undercover and find out who has bombed the police station. The trio agree to go undercover under one condition Chan must go parachuting.GenX cops starts out well and interesting but then the movie goes on autopilot it turns into a mindless action picture. Central villains are killed off for unexplained reasons and then another bad guy enters the picture.The film is also very weak on character development. Jack Match and Alien make an odd resemblance to the Ninja Turtles. They fight together they make jokes together and it's amazing the H.K. police managed to choose three recruits who act like a bunch of kids. At the start of the film we're meant to believe that the heroes hate the police yet it is never explained why they've bothered to become recruits. But other than focusing on the three heroes the film focuses on Inspector Chan who trades insults with the Inspector To Moses Chan who believes he can do better than him.Chan is a likable character but even likable characters can face unfortunate demises. It would have been best if Chan were still alive and be able to serve as the comic relief. But GenX Cops is so mean spirited that one wonders why such a lovable character would be killed off in the first place.Another death scene doesn't make any sense. Consider the scene where the villain faces the three young heroes in a final showdown. I was expecting a big death sequence here and there but wait the fight stops and the villain allows the heroes to make it out of the building if they can while the villain stays to die in an explosion.The action sequences are nothing special or exciting but confusing. It's difficult at times to know who's doing what to whom or even why. There's even a final action sequence where the trio unconvincingly try to outrun a nuclear explosion.GenX Cops has an interesting premise but a very weak execution. We're forced to watch clichs such as the bad guys realizing that the teens are actually cops and the inspector being pulled off the case and going it alone. Jackie Chan who produced the film appears by the near end of the film and steals his scene. GenX Cops is such a retread that it's a movie where I realized that I should have fallen asleep through it.".

Sound track is thumping. Actors are all very pretty. Cinematography looks like a big budget action pic.But man this flick is skin deep.Before I proceed I have to say that I am a big fan of HK cinema. More stuff from the 80's. Chow Yun Fat Maggie Cheung Tony Leung stuff. Great stuff. But unfortunately this new generation has got a long long way to go.The story. It just seemed like they didn't have a script. The film just didn't have a story. And because of that you just couldn't invest yourself into any characters. If they indeed had a script that would be even scarier.Actors. The changing of the guard has truly left a great deal to be desired. You would think with such veteran actors like Chow Yun Fat Leslie Chung Tony Leung etc. that the younger generation of HK actors would have some incredible role models to look up to and learn from. Wow the actors in this film were very very green. The older actors in the film were all good...to be expected. But the main cast of young pretty boys who were prettier than the girls...wow. Somehow I get the sense that the producers must have just picked some pretty boys off the street and said hey you wanna be in a movie? The only actor who had a grounded real and convincing presence in the young cast was Nicholas Tse. You can tell that he works hard at and takes his acting seriously. And the bar to judge is not high. He's the only actor in the entire cast that actually has an emotional connection to his words.I wanted to love this film. I don't have super high standards. As long as it's real the actors are truly emotionally invested and the story compelling I give it a thumbs up. But man Gen X Cops is like that car that is totally blinged up on the outside. It's got the body kit chrome wheels tinted windows big ass exhaust...all that cool stuff on the outside. But under the hood is just a lawnmower engine.I know this movie was a huge hit in asia. I was there when it was playing. I also know that this was meant for a certain audience and it should be seen for what it is...just a simple slick action pick. I'm not trying to hate on it. But seriously I felt like I was duped. All they needed to do was find actors who were really good and qualified to act in these roles. Trust me true charisma and acting chops will outshine just pretty looks every time. Plus giving a bit of thought into a more thoughtprovoking story line would be the least they can do.Hopefully Gen Y Cops will be better. But I'm afraid to rent that after this experience.C9".

Its very fast paced and I didn't know who the goodies or the baddies were half the time because everyone kept on killing each other. Anyway the film is based around Inspector Chan who isn't really taken seriously in his department so to prove that he can takedown a bunch of arm dealers he creates a young elite force to work for him. They then go up against the notorious young teenagers who are not afraid to kill whoever crosses them. The gang boss who controls the whole operation goes toe to toe with the elite force and the showdown at the end is definitely worth a watch. Personally I switched of from the film after a while because it seemed a bit messy. There was just too much going on at once and the dark tone of the film made it feel a bit seedy. With that aside I can understand why it went down well in its native country because it does feel like a cult movie but for this day and age it did seem a bit dated. I also found it hard to connect to any of the characters except for the inspector who put in a great performance so it has to get the thumbs down from me. Disappointing!RoundUp This movie was directed by Benny Chan who made the great Shaolin and has directed a few movies with Jackie Chan which include New Police Story RobinBHood and Who Am I?I recommend this movie to people who are into their actionthrillercomedies starring Nicholas Tse Stephen Fung Sam LeeEris Tsang Daniel Wu and Jackie Chan. 310".

	schema:headline " Actionpacked youth thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "GEN X COPS is one of those popular youthcentred action movies that were made throughout the 2000s in Hong Kong films like TOKYO RAIDERS and INVISIBLE TARGET ensemble features featuring casts of goodlooking young actors handling guns and martial arts with aplomb. More often than not director Benny Chan was at the helm of these productions and even NEW POLICE STORY with its storyline of a young disillusioned copkilling gang sometimes felt as if Jackie Chan was past it and extraneous to the central plot. GEN X COPS is one of Benny Chan's earlier offerings made as a followup to his more traditional Jackie Chan vehicle WHO AM I? and it turns out to be a lot of fun.The somewhat complex storyline sees a comedic cop played to the hilt by the everreliable Eric Tsang assembling a team of rookie cops to go undercover in the Hong Kong underworld and track down some missing weapons.

	onyx:emotionText "GEN X COPS is one of those popular youthcentred action movies that were made throughout the 2000s in Hong Kong films like TOKYO RAIDERS and INVISIBLE TARGET ensemble features featuring casts of goodlooking young actors handling guns and martial arts with aplomb. More often than not director Benny Chan was at the helm of these productions and even NEW POLICE STORY with its storyline of a young disillusioned copkilling gang sometimes felt as if Jackie Chan was past it and extraneous to the central plot. GEN X COPS is one of Benny Chan's earlier offerings made as a followup to his more traditional Jackie Chan vehicle WHO AM I? and it turns out to be a lot of fun.The somewhat complex storyline sees a comedic cop played to the hilt by the everreliable Eric Tsang assembling a team of rookie cops to go undercover in the Hong Kong underworld and track down some missing weapons.

	schema:reviewBody "I never got around to watching Gen X Cops when it was initially released but just got the chance here in 2012. Looking at the cover I must say that I was a little bit hesitant about it as it had a bunch of the pretty young boys of Hong Kong cinema on the cast list. But still being a fan of Asian and Hong Kong cinema I decided to give it a go.And I must honestly say that I was thoroughly entertained and the movie was far better than I had expected it to be.The story is about three young police officers Jack played by Nicholas Tse Match played by Stephen Fung and Alien played by Sam Lee who are cocky reckless and lacking discipline. Kicked from the police force the eccentric inspector Chan played by Eric Tsang recruits the youngsters as a special unit force to avert a disastrous situation between Hong Kong weapons dealer Daniel played by Daniel Wu and Japanese terrorist Akatora played by Tru Nakamura. Tensions run high and a lot is at stake for all involved.The story was actually quite good despite having these particular people on the cast list. I will say that it was actually a joy to see Sam Lee in this movie and of the young pretty boys he is actually the one and only of whose movies I really enjoy. Aside from that fact then Eric Tsang was great in the movie as well. More so it was spectacular to have Francis Ng playing Lok in a small supportive but very influential role and he always do a great job. And of course Jackie Chan's cameo was great as well.Gen X Cops is full of action and adrenaline and sure it does appeal more to a younger audience but still it was a great action movie if you enjoy Hong Kong action cinema. And it was a visual treat to see the Hong Kong Convention  Exhibition Center to be blown up. Given this isn't up to the level of John Woo's action movies from the 90's but still it was good entertainment.Having seen this movie now I am definitely going to give the sequel a watch within the nearest future.".

Because such is the ultimate feeling one gets from this weird enigmatic lovely film once considered so scandalous it was banned in England but now seems positively cuddly the version I saw had four minutes cut.  Go figure.Olivier is a petty thief who meets up with an old friend now a doortodoor salesman selling books on the Fine Arts.  After a dismal lack of success they come upon a woman Ariane hint of the spider? panicking because her pipes have burst.  The men fix the problem and she says she'll write to the tenant beneath currently on holiday.  Seeing a chance for a quick clean out the men break in downstairs only to find a torture chamber precision instruments of pain racks crucifixes cages in one of which creeps a cowering man and a barking doberman.This is the bondage chamber of Ariane who descends from her own flat down metallic stairs in a fantastic rubber suit and cape and blonde wig admonishing the intruders.  She asks Olivier to give her a hand with one of her clients and they begin an affair.  After getting over the shock of her profession and initially content with his sponging life he notices that Ariane has some kind of business relationship with the mysterious Gautier whom he suspects to be her pimp.  He goes to confront him.Even by the mid70s the idea of bourgeois respectability being propped up by less socially acceptable means was hardly a revolutionary insight and MAITRESSE seems less progressive than say BELLE DE JOUR with an ending that is depressingly patriarchal or joyfully subversive depending on how you read it.  The film's success lies in its sustaining of enigma with Olivier as our guide to the many mysteries Ariane raises.  How did she get the money to set up such an operation and the SM chamber is an extraordinary metallic futuristic contraption full of thematically pointed mirrors and iceblue neon?  Who is this mysterious Gautier  a Godotlike figure always expected but never arriving?  What does Ariane do by day?  Why does she go too the country manor?  Where are her family?Olivier's turning from a thief into a detective is part of his  and by association our the viewer's  quest to explain Ariane to deprive her of her power which results precisely from her mystery.  The bondage sessions with those four minutes cut are less an anthropological expose than comic and some of them are very funny and a literalisation of the real SM that is going on the power struggle between Ariane and Olivier between the female breadwinner and her male dependent.  Olivier says he wants to protect Ariane because she's scared but he really wants to take over from Gautier in controlling her  Olivier's increasing minimalising in the film is striking  having begun on his motorbike the centre of interest free driving the action from taking over his friend's job bullying the clients setting the plot in motion he becomes a marginal figure sulking from the sidelines with nothing to do but observe like us useless uncomprehending bait in a conspiracy theory that's making fun  of him.  This is an unusual act of restraint for an actor of Depardieu's munificence and is communicated with visual bluntness  who would we rather look at a hefty beefcake in a sweatsoaked singlet or a beautiful housewife putting on the most fascinating outfits and makeup like an actress at her dressing table?The style of the film adds to the air of paranoia and uncertainty.  Having been told that the cuts related simply to the more extreme forms of mutilation I assume that the ellipses and contradictions are part of the narrative method.  This is all the more jolting because Schroeder's very full miseenscene seems to give us all the information we need but how can we know anything when we identify with a character from whom everything is concealed?  Seemingly realistic scenes turn out to be roleplay and viceversa the SchroederOgier connection with Rivette isn't as implausible here as you might first think.  Schroeder refuses to make it easier by explanatory closeups or expressive acting.  The best thing is just to sit back and enjoy the confusion.".

He goes to confront him.Even by the mid70s the idea of bourgeois respectability being propped up by less socially acceptable means was hardly a revolutionary insight and MAITRESSE seems less progressive than say BELLE DE JOUR with an ending that is depressingly patriarchal or joyfully subversive depending on how you read it.  The film's success lies in its sustaining of enigma with Olivier as our guide to the many mysteries Ariane raises.  How did she get the money to set up such an operation and the SM chamber is an extraordinary metallic futuristic contraption full of thematically pointed mirrors and iceblue neon?  Who is this mysterious Gautier  a Godotlike figure always expected but never arriving?  What does Ariane do by day?  Why does she go too the country manor?  Where are her family?Olivier's turning from a thief into a detective is part of his  and by association our the viewer's  quest to explain Ariane to deprive her of her power which results precisely from her mystery.  The bondage sessions with those four minutes cut are less an anthropological expose than comic and some of them are very funny and a literalisation of the real SM that is going on the power struggle between Ariane and Olivier between the female breadwinner and her male dependent.  Olivier says he wants to protect Ariane because she's scared but he really wants to take over from Gautier in controlling her  Olivier's increasing minimalising in the film is striking  having begun on his motorbike the centre of interest free driving the action from taking over his friend's job bullying the clients setting the plot in motion he becomes a marginal figure sulking from the sidelines with nothing to do but observe like us useless uncomprehending bait in a conspiracy theory that's making fun  of him.  This is an unusual act of restraint for an actor of Depardieu's munificence and is communicated with visual bluntness  who would we rather look at a hefty beefcake in a sweatsoaked singlet or a beautiful housewife putting on the most fascinating outfits and makeup like an actress at her dressing table?The style of the film adds to the air of paranoia and uncertainty.  Having been told that the cuts related simply to the more extreme forms of mutilation I assume that the ellipses and contradictions are part of the narrative method.  This is all the more jolting because Schroeder's very full miseenscene seems to give us all the information we need but how can we know anything when we identify with a character from whom everything is concealed?  Seemingly realistic scenes turn out to be roleplay and viceversa the SchroederOgier connection with Rivette isn't as implausible here as you might first think.  Schroeder refuses to make it easier by explanatory closeups or expressive acting.  The best thing is just to sit back and enjoy the confusion.";

His life is probably more interesting even than most of his fictional characters and his other films are a short list of some of my favorites.There is really only one noteworthy element of the film and it is quite noteworthy. The central character Ariane Bulle Ogier who is reminiscent of Catherine Deneuve is quite seductive as a dominatrix who avails herself of a fetishist's dream chamber complete with a wardrobe that most people would not believe could have possibly existed when the film was made in 1973. It is the fantastic surprise of the film and the character is easily 20 years ahead of her time.Anyone into edgy fashion today would be well advised to enjoy viewing this film and accept a humbling lesson concerning underground esthetic's that existed some 30 years ago. Indeed this film alone may have helped to popularize modern fetishist sadist or bondage sensibilities especially in France. An interesting and odd film decidedly kinky and with an ending that makes a brief but incredible prediction of the work Crash by J.G.

The film's depiction of sexual activity is less shocking in an age of ubiquitous internet pornography1 and that probably is to the film's benefit. At its core this is a relationship story and it is a good one. Depardieu's Olivier is restlessly searching for someone or something to give meaning and direction to his life Ogier's Ariane so imposing in her role as dominatrix seems much smaller and more fragile once she removes her wig and is equally ready to find someone to love on her own terms to fulfill her own emotional and sexual needs. Schroeder skilfully portrays the process through which they negotiate  in fits and starts and not always successfully  the power structure of their relationship. 1 Although many viewers may find scenes of horses being slaughtered in an abattoir difficult to watch.".

I found certain very graphic scenes of torture and humiliation hard to take and I suspect that there must be different versions around. I must hasten to say that nothing I saw seemed to me gratuitous and that Maitresse is anything but an exploitation movie. It deals with the issue masochism openly and with an honest curiosity in that aspect almost like a documentary. However after seeing it I am more puzzled than before  but probably that was the intention of the makers of his movie.Maitresse is very carefully constructed. A young man comes to Paris and teams up with a professional burglar. They pretend to be doortodoor art book dealers so they can find out which flats are empty. A very nervous woman begs them after some hesitation into her spacious flat. She needs their help as her bath tub is overflowing. Asking her if she is not concerned about the downstairs neighbors she says that they are away on a holiday. That of course is the sign for the two to strike the next night. What they see in the light of their torches there are latex clothes torture instruments and even a gallows ready for use. The older man's reaction It's all cheap unsellable stuff let's get out. Then the ray of their flashlight hits a cage with an old naked man crouching in it then from the ceiling a folding staircase is lowered and the woman from the day before descends together with a fierce dog called Texas.I decided to describe this opening scenes because they set the tone. A large part of the movie is about deceiving pretending and make believe which seems to be one of the major kicks masochists get out of their apparently precisely timed rituals. It seemed evident to me that the woman planned the burglary in order to lay her hands on the young hunk played by a then not yet famous Gerard Depardieu. Apart from an instant sexual attraction there evolves a kind of a love story as the man moves into the upstairs apartment the movable staircase incidentally is hidden underneath a coffee table with Chinese wood inlays. But commercial interests are never far. The woman clearly expects him to participate in the business giving her an occasional helping hand. He for his part thinks that maybe more money could be squeezed out of the enterprise. But he abhors bodily maltreatment. Before he moved to Paris so he tells he worked in a slaughterhouse and could not stand it getting used to the slaughter ritual. The whole business rather sickens and stuns him. The prevailing nature of the couple's relationship never becomes clear up to the enigmatic final scene. And strangely this is an asset here.As to the issue of masochism the movie bluntly states that there are people who are in need of being occasionally tortured and humiliated. And that it is no easy issue with devastating emotional effects. These people are the woman's customers and expect full service. No doubt is left that they are rich and influential to the point of being above the law. It also becomes apparent that they leave very precise directions as to how they want to be treated  it is as horrific as it is dull and uninspired the movie shows even that. Sometimes the directives become too much even for the experienced dominatrix.The question of who is on top and who is under the heel here literally becomes a new rather quirky significance. The upstairsdownstairs situation in the woman's establishment shows this masterfully. The movie makes it clear that the downstairs people have the say. After all they are the customers. Those upstairs are merely servants. So why not just quit? The couple makes an open end attempt in that direction in the final scenes of this interesting thought provoking movie.".

It's obvious that for the more serious SM scenes a body double was used for Bulle Ogier the body double has hands that look about 20 years older than Ogier's and she was probably a professional dominatrix. Consequently it feels more like documentary footage shot in a dungeon. Combined with the real and graphic footage in the abattoir it all feels gratuitous and clearly thrown in just to 'sex' the whole thing up a bit. I'm sure at the time the shock value of this film was enough. But it's not aged particularly well. For instance the scene at the chteaux loses it bite as it's immediately obvious to the modern viewer what's going on. I watch a lot of arthouse films often from the 60s and 70s and with depressing regularity the female characters get slapped about by their boyfriends. When Olivier tries that with Ariane Bulle Ogier she headbutts him. I don't think I can ever remember seeing a leading lady headbutting someone outside of a martial arts film. It's genuinely a shocking scene.Despite all this if you strip all the exploitative material out you're left with quite a nice romantic comedy. Olivier Grard Depardieu is such a buffoon that despite the occasional thuggish outburst is rather nonthreatening the perfect romantic comedy staple. The final reveal as to who Gautier is rather anticlimactic. I guess it's meant to be a fantasy within a fantasy sort of thing.The best thing for me in this film were the Karl Largerfeld costumes.Overall 610.".

	schema:reviewBody "Riproaring third remake of the classic newspaper comedy The Front Page makes some memorable exchanges and sensational acting from everyone . Cynical editor newspaper Walter Matthau wants to get a big scoop on a death row which involves convincing star reporter Jack Lemmon to come back to work and put off her marriage to handsome pianist woman Susan Sarandon . Lemmon can't resist covering some good news  even when it mean helping a condemned man Austin Pendleton getaway the law . And the escaped convicted murderer offers the journalist an exclusive interview . Other reporters Dick O'Neill Charles Durning Allen Garfield  David Wayne  Cliff Osmond also give hilarious acting in this breathless pursuit of an exclusive with the escaped death row inmate . A splendid remake of the Ben Hecht  Charles MacArthur play about a scheming managing publisher of a 1920s Chicago newspaper and his incautious reporter. Very good performance from Jack Lemmon as ace journalist who wants to quit the business and get married and exceptional Walter Matthau as editor who finds out his main reporter wants to leave him and gets in the way . Phenomenal playing from everyone  including a topnotch secondary cast as Carol Burnett  Vincent Gardenia  Harold Gould and magnificent direction render this frequenttold story more funny than usual . One of Wilder's most inventive and furious screen combats in which Lemmon and Matthau are given equal footing with staccato dialog and marvelous interpretations . I.A.L. Diamond's brilliantly tart screenplay overlaps dialogue and scenes to carry the black farce along the rollercoasted speed . Certainly the kind of movie that Billy Wilder only can make  though achieved moderated success in 1974 . Meanwhile  do't miss this stunning adaptation. Other versions about this classic story are the following  1931 The Front Page by Lewis Milestone with Adolph Menjou  Edward Everett Horton  Mae Clark and Pat O'Brien in his film debut  His Girl Friday  1940 by Howard Hawks with Gary Grant  Ralph Bellamy and Rosalind Russell with the pivotal character assigned to a woman instead a man  Switching channels 1988 by Ted Kotcheff with Kathleen Turner  Christopher Reeve  Ned Beatty and Burt Reynolds in which an attractive TV anchorwoman want to marry tycoon but his mean exhusband impedes it .".

Other reporters Dick O'Neill Charles Durning Allen Garfield  David Wayne  Cliff Osmond also give hilarious acting in this breathless pursuit of an exclusive with the escaped death row inmate . A splendid remake of the Ben Hecht  Charles MacArthur play about a scheming managing publisher of a 1920s Chicago newspaper and his incautious reporter. Very good performance from Jack Lemmon as ace journalist who wants to quit the business and get married and exceptional Walter Matthau as editor who finds out his main reporter wants to leave him and gets in the way . Phenomenal playing from everyone  including a topnotch secondary cast as Carol Burnett  Vincent Gardenia  Harold Gould and magnificent direction render this frequenttold story more funny than usual . One of Wilder's most inventive and furious screen combats in which Lemmon and Matthau are given equal footing with staccato dialog and marvelous interpretations . I.A.L. Diamond's brilliantly tart screenplay overlaps dialogue and scenes to carry the black farce along the rollercoasted speed . Certainly the kind of movie that Billy Wilder only can make  though achieved moderated success in 1974 . Meanwhile  do't miss this stunning adaptation. Other versions about this classic story are the following  1931 The Front Page by Lewis Milestone with Adolph Menjou  Edward Everett Horton  Mae Clark and Pat O'Brien in his film debut  His Girl Friday  1940 by Howard Hawks with Gary Grant  Ralph Bellamy and Rosalind Russell with the pivotal character assigned to a woman instead a man  Switching channels 1988 by Ted Kotcheff with Kathleen Turner  Christopher Reeve  Ned Beatty and Burt Reynolds in which an attractive TV anchorwoman want to marry tycoon but his mean exhusband impedes it .";

	schema:reviewBody "I'm sure that the reason for Billy Wilder to do a remake of The Front Page is the fact that around the time this was made politicians running for office on 'law and order' platforms was suddenly coming into vogue. The chief example among these was Richard Nixon and we all know what happened to him in 1974. Seemed like a case of perfect timing to me.The original material that Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur wrote in the Twenties was perfect for Billy Wilder's cynical mind. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau were born to play the roles of Hildy Johnson and Walter Burns. Of course other things now that the Code was lifted could also be made more explicit. David Wayne's character of Benzinger is quite openly gay in the film. It's an interesting characterization he does. Of course he's the butt of all the jokes in the pressroom but I thought it rather funny when at the end when title cards show what happened to all the principal characters he was the only one with a happily ever after ending. He settled down with a life partner and ran an antique store. A rather subtle comment on the sanctity of heterosexual marriage decades before gay marriage was an issue.Carol Burnett was a big fan of Billy Wilder and it is mentioned in a recent biography of Wilder that she wanted very much to be in one of his films. Carol got her wish and did very well as Molly the prostitute who befriends poor Earl Williams the anarchist who accidentally killed a policeman and is sentenced to be hung.Austin Pendleton is all right as Williams but no one ever played the role quite like John Qualen in His Girl Friday. Qualen had a patent on those little men up against the system parts. This version of The Front Page is also the farewell performance of Allen Jenkins playing a small role as a telegrapher.Speaking of His Girl Friday my favorite part in all versions of The Front Page is that of the messenger from the governor carrying Earl Williams reprieve. No one will ever top Billy Gilbert in His Girl Friday though Paul Benedict of The Jeffersons gives a good account of himself as well.Sad to say that demagogic politicians who bray about law and order are still among us. Maybe it's time for another remake of The Front Page.".

	schema:headline " Well if it's in the papers it must be true. They wouldn't print a lie.";
	schema:reviewBody "When Howard Hawks released his classic screwball comedy 'His Girl Friday' in 1940 it was a pretty safe bet that the film would forever remain the definitive cinematic version of Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur's hit Broadway comedy of 1928. It takes a truly talented director to successfully remake a classic and indeed talent is a quality that Billy Wilder has in great abundance as he proved time and time again throughout a prolific career. Jack Lemmon stars as Hildebrand Hildy Johnson an ace reporter with the Chicago Examiner newspaper in 1929 who decides to resign and get married on the eve of a major execution. Walter Matthau also stars as Walter Burns the cunning scheming newspaper boss who cannot afford to allow Hildy to quit the business at any cost. The two actors make an absolute dream partnership and as always work incredibly well together they had previously shared the screen in 'The Fortune Cookie 1966' and 'The Odd Couple 1968' and would do so on many more subsequent occasions.In the crowded press room of a Chicago jail a cluster of rival newspaper reporters clamour about for the perfect exclusive story centred around the execution of a convicted copkiller Earl Williams Austin Pendleton. In their desperate bid to write a great article these inherently dishonest journalists will even occasionally fabricate their own news stories but this strategy turns out to be rather unnecessary on this night. As Hildy arrives at the jail to farewell his comrades determined to ignore the shrewd obstacles of his exemployer the story of a lifetime falls directly into his lap and now it will take ever ounce of his willpower to resist the urge to report and to start a new life in advertising. While the two leads are of course terrific enjoyable supporting performances are given by Pendleton as the prisoner awaiting execution Vincent Gardenia as the bumbling sheriff and Susan Sarandon as Hildy's wouldbe future wife.Though 'The Front Page 1974' the third adaptation of the play doesn't cover any different ground than 'His Girl Friday' did with the exception of reverting Hildy back to a male character it is the quality of the script the chemistry between the leads and the selection of quirky supporting characters that make this an essential complementary viewing experience for fans of Hawks' film. Watching this one made me remember just how much I had enjoyed 'His Girl Friday' the story is a classic writeup of eccentric situations and quickfire verbal clashes and both movies exploit this to its full potential. I wouldn't go as far as saying that 'The Front Page' is a superior comedy but it is a worthy effort and Wilder fans could not possibly be disappointed. The screenplay was penned by Wilder and regular cocontributer I.A.L. Diamond and is packed with an excellent selection of quotable oneliner insults. I also loved the sly reference to the Saint Valentine's Day Massacre at which of course Jack Lemmon was present in 'Some Like it Hot 1959.'".

	schema:reviewBody "I found 'The Front Page' to be a bit of a step up from the 1931 original and a couple of notches under 'His Girl Friday'. The thing is one could argue for quite some time why one version is superior to another but in this case with these movies it would be a really silly argument to make. The only way 'The Front Page' seems to suffer from what I've read on this site is that its 1 Not as fast paced as 'His Girl Friday' and 2 Too much profanity mixed in with too much yelling.Yes it's not as quickly paced as 'His Girl Friday' but there aren't too many movies that are as fast paced AND as good as 'His Girl Friday'. Sure there's more profanity in this film than in the original and Hawks' version put together but that's because there really wasn't any profanity in those earlier films. The other films used innuendo and some expertly placed camera mugging to get their laughs on film while getting over on the censors. The 'Wilder' version wasn't restricted to how far their dialog could go they had more freedom and could abandon subtlety and nuance. I guess sometimes freedom can take you too far.The profanity in this film doesn't bother me at all besides the film takes place in a newspaper room where the newspaper writers spend most of their time playing poker drinking alcohol and making fun of prostitutes. Perhaps Wilder's version is more realistic in this regard. I think maybe the reason Billy Wilder slowed everything down and had so much yelling was to make sure that people actually heard the dialog in the film. It's too bad all they seemed to hear in the film was the profanity there are some great moments of witty dialog amongst the crude and profane expletives.Jack Lemmon Hildy Johnson and Walter Matthau Walter Burns are perfectly cast in their roles. I would say Jack Lemmon is a definite upgrade in the case of Lemmon vs. Pat O'Brien in the role of Hildy Johnson but perhaps a close tie between Jack and Rosalind Russell. Maybe the edge goes to Rosalind. Maybe.Matthau and Adolphe Menjou work out to be about the same. Menjou was the best thing about the original but even so he rates about the same as Matthau in the role of Walter Burns. Matthau is always brilliant. I guess Cary Grant gets the edge because he's Cary Grant and had much more to work with. Grant has great chemistry with Rosalind Russell as does Lemmon and Matthau but Grant and Russell were working on a sexual chemistry that is not at all evident let alone not appropriate between Lemmon and Matthau. Grant is even better with his digs against Ralph Bellamy than Matthau is with Susan Sarandon. However the moment where Matthau and Sarandon are both vying for the attention of Lemmon is fantastic. Once Matthau leans over Lemmon's typewriter and puts his arm around his ace reporter lost in his work not in his marital plans he knows that he's won the battle furthermore he knows that she knows he's won the battle.Oh no I just realized that I started to make a silly argument. See all three start with the original save 'His Girl Friday' for last. The Wilder version will have to suffice to being the glossy shiny colorful pull out middle section you get to read in the bathroom.810. Clark Richards".

	schema:reviewBody "Billy Wilder's work didn't exactly decline in quality during the 70's rather he seems to have been making less of an effort to break new ground and reinvent genres instead leaning back on genres he new well and making perfectly solid films that were fun to make and fun to watch. The Front Page is no exception on the surface it's easy to blame Wilder of lacking originality in adapting a play that had been put to film twice before. However the 1931 version really isn't good enough to pay attention to and the 1940 version His Girl Friday changed things around quite a bit making Wilder's version the definitive version of the play. Wilder reverted the lead role from a woman back to a man retaining the relationship between the two leads to the 'male life partners' version that the original play had which I found more interesting than the romantic relationship in 'His Girl Friday'.And the best thing is that the chemistry between Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau is so good that they make this relationship really work. They worked twice before in 'The Odd Couple' and 'The Fortune Cookie' and once again prove how good they are together a testament to that is that the first half of 'The Front Page' in which Lemmon interacts with actors like Susan Sarandon and Austin Pendleton moves along with a lazy pace usually witty but never grabs the viewers completely but the second half which is mostly around Lemmon and Matthau sparks all over the place and is an absolute joy to watch right up to the ending  and nobody could direct an ending scene like Wilder. It's Wilder's knack for pacing that makes the film work and Lemmon and Matthau have amazing timing that compliments it perfectly. The film may not be groundbreaking but it's a nearly perfectly made comedy with some vicious observations about the nature of media and politics.".

Hildy is about to resign and retire from his position as acereporter of the Chicago Examiner but Walter his editor will have none of it. For years he has trusted Hildy to write intelligent articles covering issues in the world in order to produce one of the finest papers around.

Wilder and cowriter I.A.L. Diamond provide the men with several opportunities to put their loquaciousness to the test as the camera finds a way to fixate on them for several minutes at a time as the two bat off rapidfire dialog at one another.It is this chemistry that makes The Front Page a good piece of work and all the more fun especially in the present time as it shows the functionality of oldschool journalism and reporting and how journalists back in the day worked and operated. It's also hard to neglect a supporting cast made up of Carol Burnett Susan Sarandon and Charles Durning who in some way contribute to the film's overall success as a whole. And let us not forget the incredible talent of Billy Wilder who takes one of the most cleanedup occupations of the Roaring Twenties and Great Depressionera and turns it into complete lunacy filled with those who go to astounding lengths to achieve a story worthy of the front page.

The cast does what they canMatthau is horrible but doesn't destroy the movie Lemmon although too old for the role is just great Sarandon is shamefully wasted but she was unknown when she did this Carol Burnett is surprisingly not that good as a prostitute yesyou read that rightCarol Burnett plays a prostitute Austin Pendleton is letterperfect as Earl Williams Vincent Gardenia explodes and yells a lot as the sheriff and Harold Gould wisely underplays the part of the mayor.So this is a good movie but too loud and crude. And it's a real travesty if you compare it to His Girl Friday. See it for the cast and the great sets.";

	schema:reviewBody "It may sound distinctly familiar to anyone who's seen one particular alltime classic screwball comedy called His Girl Friday but because it's the same eternally ripe material by the same Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur and because it's in the hands of one of the wittiest filmmakers of Hollywood's Golden Age it all feels fresh. We escape right into the world of the Chicago press room of the 1920s where a few shy of a dozen casehardened crime reporters lean on desks and play cards snapping their suspenders and sputtering out the wet ends of their cigars. We are in a new generation of faces look and style watching a movie made in 1974. But the talent in front of the camera includes the inimitable presence of Lemmon Matthau Charles Durning Allen Garfield Vincent Gardenia and Carol Burnett as well as other duly fasttalking character actors. Were it not for the snappy energy and comic veteranship these performers bring to their roles and Wilder's oldschool deference to the primacy of the writing The Front Page delivers virtually the same neat fastpaced pickmeup vibes as the quintessential classic wisecracking comedy and the quintessential classic picture about Chicago in the 1920s About scoophungry police reporters dishonest politicians a fugitive who exhausts half the film hidden in a rolltop desk in the very press room where a parade of frantic folks are wearing out the subject of where he could be.In His Girl Friday Chicago was never ever named. In this version Wilder reinstates direct inclusion of the Sheriff of Cook County the Mayor of Chicago the newspapers and so on. And there are no milquetoast newspaper fictions like the Chicago Globe. We are ingenuously stepping back in time and seeing all the real names The Daily News the Tribune and actual front pages as well. I mean sounds apt to me. Here Wilder is a great storytelling pragmatist as always The Front Page just couldn't be set in the present day. Journalism isn't like that anymore.In those days the days when Wilder himself was one of those half dozen or so stringers he and they slipped any amount of bills stayed up however many nights punched however many keys it took to get a story and never more so than in Chicago. I wonder if the Chicago reporters were more cynical because Chicago itself was more cynical and crooked. The nature of this breed of reporter is anchored in circulation wars and Hearst's yellow sins. The soulcrushing corruption and propaganda is ever present now just more sophisticated gentrified and spun well where as in these times it literally was a racket and there probably wasn't a newspaper town in the country more aggressive and exhilarating than Chicago. This also gives the material leeway in pulling some pretty nifty little takeoffs on fads of the time such as Freudian psychiatry as represented by the character of Dr. Eggelhofer to whom everything seems to be a phallic symbol.Wilder and his longtime screen writing partner I.A.L. Diamond sprinkle in a few allusions to other major scoops of the era like the New York Daily News photos of Ruth Judd in the electric chair and the LeopoldLoeb case. Oh and of course the Chicago fire which the gang of newspaper bloodhounds insist to their contacts isn't as big a story as the one about the escapee. But on the whole Wilder and Diamond are careful what they change and not much has been. The original basic structure of The Front Page is as sturdy as any drumtight bulletpaced farce. You can't change or even anachronize the deathrow escapee hiding in the desk. Austin Pendleton's nebbishy version is no better than John Qualen in His Girl Friday just an inimitable variation.And when there are changes like the addition of a bullied babyface rookie reporter we realize we're not watching a farce of the same economy and crispness like those in the time of Hawks and McCarey. It's such a more modern touch to add this figure simply to underline the veterans' contempt for the nave collegians that it's almost like peering behind the magician's curtain. Regardless we are watching Wilder and Diamond handling Hecht and Macarthur and the razorsharp exchanges the tempo and the structure have been upheld. You could sum up the whole gist of the movie in the most transitory moments when the flock of correspondents dashes to the windows searchlights seek and sirens screech and the reporters dash back to their candlestick teleophones and bark the tried and true standbys Give me city desk! Stop the presses! Tear up the front page! We've located Williams! This time for real!".

But it also is not supposed to be a highquality movie. It's supposed to be funny.And funny it is. The movie is full of funny ideas all worked out in a good classy manner. Even the basest of jokes are done in good style. Just relax  and laugh. And you'll keep laughing through most of the movie. The monkey that's a negative point  technically an urang utan is an ape not a monkey is well in its place as a comedy actor and as said  the ideas are good the workingout is even better.Not 'the best movie you'll ever see' not even close. Not a 'mustsee movie'. But a very pleasant way to spend 90 minutes. And enjoyable for both adults and children that's worth something too.".

Congo 1995 taught us that apes could be both intelligent and evil. Let's not forget 1995's Born to be Wild where a teenage boy and female gorilla's near bestiality captured all our hearts. However not since the original Planet of Apes has a movie captivated our attention and made us feel what it's like to be a monkey. Dunston Checks In set the bar for years to come. Sam the orangutan's performance as Dunston is both hilarious and heartbreaking. Blockbuster actors such as Ben Affleck and James Franco could learn a lesson or two from Sam. You think Ben Affleck was emotional when he said I love you to Bruce Willis in Armageddon? Think again. When Sam looks at the picture of him and his now dead brother his expression alone brings a tear to ones eye. You think James Franco was in pain in SpiderMan 2 when he realized his best friend was the man who killed his father? Try watching Sam when he is getting a piece of glass torn from his flesh. Sam's connection with the audience is so great you almost feel the glass being ripped from your own hand. This is not to mention the other wonderful qualities this movie has. Amazing slapstick comedy alcoholic older women Jason Alexander cursing Faye Dunaway's fall from grace an orangutan spanking a prominent socialite and a cameo from Paul Reubens that can only be explained with two words Oscar worthy. The fact that this film did not win any Academy Awards is shocking. Five for sure Paul Reubens beating out Cuba Gooding Jr. and James Woods for Best Supporting Actor Dunston Checks In narrowly defeating The English Patient for Best Picture Ken Kwapis for Best Director Best Music Robert Blackwell and lastly a landslide victory for Sam the orangutan for Best Actor. It is criminal that the Academy shafted this great film in 1996 with no Oscars and zero nominations. Although it was given no Oscars this much can be certain it set the standard and paved the way for future primate movies. Where would MVP Most Vaulable Primate and MXP Most Xtreme Primate be without Dunston Checks In? In some Hollywood executive's trash that's where. Because of pioneer movies like Dunston Checks In movies like MVP and MXP enjoy much commercial success. So grab your kids round up the neighbor pop some popcorn and get ready to laugh and cry at one of the best movies in the last twenty years Dunston Checks In.".

A four star hotel run by Alexander who lives there with his two sons is up for a prestigious fifth star in the ratings guide when a jewel thief comes to visit utilizing an orangutan as his accomplice. The firebreathing owner turns on the heat to succeed while all hell breaks loose thanks to the primate. There seems to be something for everyone in it. The film begins with a lot of class as the various accoutrements of the hotel are featured. Kids should adore the orangutan Dunston and be able to identify with young Lloyd as his pal. Seinfeld fans should enjoy watching Alexander face all sorts of turmoil and hubbub as the harried hotel manager. Everett is comic in a grand oldstyle sort of way with wrinkles false teeth and a very threatening cane. There are a number of very talented supporting players who add to the comedic flair of the movie Shadix Bassey. Even former Pee Wee Reubens has a cameo as a very aggressive exterminator. The endall beall though is Dunaway. As the Leona Helmsleyesque ultrademanding hyperglamorous hotel owner she walks off with the film and shows a rare funny side. It's not every day you see Dunaway with pink cake and icing all over her face. She cuts loose with a game vivid aware comedic performance which echoes all the neurotic bitchy roles she used to play but gave up after the stigma of Mommie Dearest wouldn't wear off. Somehow this missed at the box office but it is perfect family entertainment for home video.".

When I first saw it in theaters at the age of nine I loved it as did my younger brother.I haven't seen it in years but I do remember some great moments. The best one is Paul Reubens as an animal control official who chases Dunston the Orangutan into a greenhouse. He fires his gun off and startles two old ladies sitting in an office who then see him out a window looking into the greenhouse. For a few seconds the two ladies stare at him and he stares back. It's funny. The one kids will remember most will probably be Dunston jumping on Faye Dunaway and she falls backwards into a giant cake. Paul Reubens is definitely a highlight in this movie.Like I said I haven't seen the movie in years and I imagine I would feel differently about it now. When I was a kid I didn't know that Faye Dunaway was a movie legend. Now that I've seen Bonnie and Clyde Chinatown and Network it might be a little weird seeing her in this role.So I feel that the kids and the kidlike will enjoy this movie. The older people probably not so much.".

The monkey finds Kyle and he hides him from the villain and they have secret fun together while the father works.I was amazed at how funny this movie is. I found myself laughing on numerous occasions which is a sign of a good comedy.However I should note that most of the humor is stuff that will go over most kid's heads.I could give you numerous examples but a brief one is a scene in which Brian Kyle's older brother is about to go down the laundry chute to find Dunston. Right before Kyle pulls him down Brian gives him a stern look and says If something happens to me throw away the magazines under my bed!I had to think about that for a second but then I laughed and thoughtWow! They actually made that joke in a family movie!But the movie IS PG. There is also languagethe D and H words and one loud S word from Jason Alexander that the movie COULD have done without. That is something you may want to consider. I would let a 6 or 7 year old see it though.Because of how fun it is I am giving it a 10. The movie is no classic but it is a great movie for the whole family. And that is all it needs to be!".

They actually made that joke in a family movie!But the movie IS PG. There is also languagethe D and H words and one loud S word from Jason Alexander that the movie COULD have done without. That is something you may want to consider. I would let a 6 or 7 year old see it though.Because of how fun it is I am giving it a 10. The movie is no classic but it is a great movie for the whole family. And that is all it needs to be!";

	schema:reviewBody "Mauro Bolognini's most critically acclaimed film is far from his best. A tale of a 'working class hero' in turnofthecentury Florence it seems fundamentally unsuited to this director's world view. Most of Bolognini's films take place in an aesthetic and rather camp universe ruled by powerful and glamorous women Claudia Cardinale in La Viaccia Gina Lollobrigida in Un Bellissimo Novembre Dominique Sanda in The Inheritance who hold effortless sway over effete and malleable men.Yet this film of Vasco Pratolini's novel was Bolognini's pet project for nearly a decade. If he had managed to cast Albert Finney as he hoped to do in 1963 the character and his story might have a shade more conviction. But prettyboy pop star Massimo Ranieri barely seems capable of reading his lines off a cue card never mind digesting huge chunks of Das Kapital. Faced with the inadequacy of his male lead Bolognini does what he has always done  and lets the women rule the film.The least interesting woman by far is Metello's saintly wife Ersilia Ottavia Piccolo. A saltoftheearth proletarian Madonna figure she keeps her husband in line largely by boring him and the audience into a state of submission. Piccolo is an actress of minimal charisma and her Best Actress award from the 1970 Cannes Film Festival has to be one of life's great mysteries. Far more amusing is Tina Aumont as Idina  the couple's frivolous and flirtatious neighbour. We wait for the inevitable to happen and of course...Early on in the film Metello has a fling with Viola  a sensual middleaged school teacher played by Lucia Bose. As usual Bose is stunning but has far too little to do. One of the screen's great wasted natural resources Bose has the magnetism of a Garbo  but she also has a maddening tendency to retire for decades at a time. Given roles as limited as this one who can really blame her?As always in a Bolognini film the visuals in Metello are flawless. The camerawork by Ennio Guarnieri evokes old photographs of the period. The sets and costumes supervised by Piero Tosi are almost eerie in their perfection. Midway through the cast enjoy a night out at a music hall and the film springs to life  as Bolognini finally gets a chance for a bit of flamboyance which is what he does best. Sorry but I can't get excited about Metello. Its appeal I suspect is largely to those who do not enjoy Bolognini's other and better work. Still it's one of his easier films to come by. Fans of arty Italian cinema must take our pleasure where we can get it!".

Several other great things work in Fresh Hare's favour. The animation is detailed and luscious of course Elmer is fatter than we usually see him and Bugs more elongated but they are still well drawn within this stage in Looney Tunes animation. The music is full of energy and character and is always pleasant on the ears. The dialogue is as witty and funny as ever and the gags are clever and imaginative. The story is simple but with never a dull spot it is fun all the way through. I do agree though that the ending is random and rather awkwardsome may also find it tasteless.

At the start he is viewing several trees with posters of Bugs wanted dead or alive but preferably dead. As he passes each tree Elmer sees someone has been marking up the posters with comments and putting a mustache on Bugs' face one of the posters interestingly enough puts a Hitler mustache on Bugs. Not every tree has these posters  one has an advertisement for the Mountie Police Gazette with a voluptuous lady on the poster.Eventually Elmer finds Bugs' rabbit hole and handcuffs himself to Bugs only to find 1 the wascally wabbit has substituted a lit bomb to the handcuffs and 2 has purloined Elmer's handkey key. Helpfully Bugs tries to find the right key there are five but reaches it as the bomb goes off.Elmer chases Bugs all over the Canadian wilds frequently he and Bugs crashing into the snow banks and leaving their images in the banks to show they were there. But Bugs is always faster  managing to end up chasing Elmer once and also managing to get his two ears to go around a tree that he has to pass Elmer crashes into the tree and ends up looking like Santa Clause.At one point Bugs insists on knowing what he is wanted for  Elmer reads a list of charges including jay walking and being a pest and as mentioned in the Summary Line above conduct unbecoming a rabbit. Although Elmer does not catch Bugs he is so miserable he cries for his failure and Bugs feels sorry enough for him to give himself up. Elmer is in charge of the firing squad and asks if Bugs has any last wishes. Here is the point where the cartoon is tampered with today. Bugs says I wish...I wish...I wish I was in the land of Cotton old times there are not forgotten. At this point Elmer and the firing squad look amazed at this unexpected wasting of a wish. But as the cartoon originally ended Elmer Bugs and the members of the firing squad reappear as minstrels singing Dixie. Curiously when I saw the original ending it did not strike me as being worth saving. It made absolutely no sense  but then so would the current ending of Bugs bursting into song in front of a surprised firing squad. If you think of the anarchistic humor of the Warner's cartoons either is acceptable but not particularly clever. As pointed too Elmer was drawn as a fat person here  for the last time complete with corset. In fact the fat headed bald Fudd of the later cartoons is quite an improvement too.".

This particularlyrotund version of Fudd was a shortlived design used in five cartoons in 1941 and 1942 and was based upon the dimensions of voice actor Arthur Q. Bryan who played him. In 'Fresh Hare 1942' Fudd braves the snow and ice of the Canadian wilderness where his added layers might actually come in handy to capture the wanted outlaw Bugs Bunny who is charged with a long list of crimes everything from jaywalking to conduct unbecoming to a wabbit. Of course Bugs has little respect for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police colloquially known as the mounties and as might be expected has no intentions of surrendering without a fight.This cartoon while nothing particular special amid a vast catalogue of similar BugsFudd encounters has enough interesting and funny moments to keep the viewer entertained for the full seven minutes. After the inept hunter tracks Bugs to his rabbithole via a trail of graffitivandalised WANTED posters and a rather risqu picture of a woman he discovers that finding the fugitive was only the beginning of his troubles. When Bugs finds himself handcuffed early in the film we're certain that this couldn't possibly be the end of the struggle and sure enough the rabbit somehow contorts himself out of custody and replaces his wrist with a fuselit bomb. Later Fudd is stripped off all his clothing  well almost all his clothing  and left completely exposed to the elements while Bugs makes a quick getaway there are also a few amusing visual gags with the characters' outlines in the ice.Having seen Tex Avery's 'The Heckling Hare 1941' earlier today I noticed that here director Friz Freleng recycles one of the gags from that film as Bugs' ears miraculously separate to avoid an obstacle as he darts through the deep snow. Most often nowadays 'Fresh Hare' is noted only for its somewhat controversial ending which has subsequently been censored by dogooders to gloss over America's darker racial history. Personally I didn't really find anything particularly wrong with the ending in which Bugs bursts into a chorus of I Wish I Was in Dixie and the cast briefly performs a few lines of Camptown Races in blackface. True it's completely random and doesn't contribute much to the story but my greater annoyance in any case is with the attempt to alter the film itself which I regard as cultural vandalism in a sense.

So why are so many people on here including adults saying that the black and white minstrels point at the end is racist?! It does not make any sense. Either my family has the wrong idea or they have the wrong idea  and frankly my familys' opinion is MY familys' so I will stick with theirs. Anyhow now that I've heaved that off my shoulders this is one fun Bugs Bunny cartoon! There is nothing insulting in it at all as far as I know and it has a great deal of good jokes packed in! This episode is particularly funny. I also like Bugs Bunny and Elmer here I wish they kept Elmer's animation like that he is also smarter here than in his more wellknown appearances. I recommend this fun cartoon to anyone who likes old Bugs Bunny cartoons and does not mind anything too badly that is portrayed as politically incorrect nowadays. Enjoy Fresh Hare! ".

	schema:reviewBody "THE MISFITS is a delicate gem of a film poetic and harsh and as cold as those western stars on the horizon that Gable and Monroe drive toward at film's end. The title refers to the wild mustangs they hunt but it also describes the 4 main characters each lost in a world they hardly recognize. At one point Monroe points to a mountain vista and says it's like a dream. Each of the characters is wounded and lost in some way. Marilyn Monroe plays a divorce trying to figure out what to do next. Clark Gable plays a cowboy in a vanishing west. Montgomery Clift plays a rancher cheated out of his legacy when his mother remarries. Eli Wallach plays a guy whose life has come to a standstill after the death of his wife. The characters circle each other trying to make connections but their timing is always off. Gable and Monroe seem to find something until they go on the mustang hunt.Gable is magnificent as the aging cowboy who fears working for wages as the final sign of giving in to the commonplace and losing the old west. But the old west is of course already lost. Most of the action takes place in and around Reno the perfect symbol for what the west has become. His drunk scene after he has seen his kids is astonishing in its pain and ugliness. It's a great performance.Monroe is stunning and gives a quiet and simple performance that shows what she could have done had she lived. Leaving her dumb blonde persona in the dust what we get here is Monroe the actress and she's just plain terrific. Aside from the scene done in a long shot where she rages at the men after they have captured the horses Monroe plays this character very quietly and with lots of small reactions watch her eyes. It's a great performance.Clift and Wallach do wonders with their characters and provide a lot of the tension since all three men pursue Monroe. Thelma Ritter is solid as Isabelle. Estelle Winwood has an odd role as the old lady collecting money. James Barton and Kevin McCarthy have small roles.I think THE MISFITS is a must see for any serious film buff. The film collapsed under the weight of its publicity in 1961 and there was a huge backlash when Gable died within 2 weeks of finishing the film. Yet the film is gorgeous a shimmering Arthur Miller poem to the worlds and people we've lost.".

	schema:headline " A Lesson in Film";
	schema:reviewBody "This once nearly forgotten movie the last film of Clark Gable and Marilyn Monroe is now coming forward in the lexicon of film history as an underrated gem.  Universally misunderstood for the most part at the time it came out it is clear now that this film was at least five of six years ahead of it's time. It fits in more comfortably with films of the late 60's and early 70's.   The screenplay by Miller is one of his most striking works. A story of a group of people lost in the wide expanse of the West in search of the discarded souls of their misspent lives. The film's beautiful cinematography by Russell Metty stands out as superb artistry at the demise of the black and white era. It shimmers with the silver of the deep expanse of the desert and the flat grays and blacks of the distant mountains upon which the last act of the story plays. The music by Alex North is among his best work and gives a savage punch to the aerial scenes and the round up at the end of the wild mustangs. Montgomery Clift by now sliding into the last years of his life is touching in his performance of Perce. His broken cowboy with the broken heart is almost painful to watch. His phone call home to his mother is among some of his best work.  Eli Wallach gives a strong deeply moving portrait of Guido who has lost his wife his way and his humanity. He shines in his scene with Monroe where he asks her to save him. When she can't to at least say Hello Guido'. Thelma Ritter is well Thelma Ritter in yet another of her excellent character roles. Ritter is the master of the one line wisecrack but here as Isobel she laces the cracks with an underlying sadness and vulnerability.  As Gay Langland Clark Gable gives what I consider to be the best performance of his career.  It was a brave move for Gable to take on the role of what on the surface seems another one of his typical macho made to fit parts. But as the story unfolds from Arthur Miller's pen Gay reveals that beneath his gruff not a care in the world cowboy is a man in deep pain and despair at his losses. The world has left him behind. Abandoned by his children the drunken Gable breaks so violently it is a shock to watch the great man fall. This is Clark Gable at his finest ever.  Marilyn Monroe gives an astounding performance as Roslyn Tabler the newly divorced dancer. A damaged woman who finds in the company of these three men something to finally believe in something to stand up and fight for she finds life. It is a performance ground out in part from her own person and experience and in part by the director John Huston and the editor George Tomasini who helped a nearly destroyed Monroe create her stunning Roslyn. This her last performance is her best and the true example of the collaborative creation that film really is. That Marilyn under the circumstances of her life at that time could be so good is a testament to her talent as an actress and a star. Watch her when she is listening to the other actors. This is where she shines this is the true mark of a great screen actor. To be able to listen and draw you into the inner life of the character through that deceptively simple act of listening and reaction is her gift to the audience.  Her scene with Monty in back of the bar sitting on a pile of trash her afore mentioned scene with Eli Wallach in the speeding car. These are but a few of the examples in this film of her great talent. In the 1950's and early 60's there were only a handful of great young actresses in film Elizabeth Taylor and Marilyn Monroe where at the summit of the small mountain.".

	schema:headline " Did Gable really have to die for the making of The Misfits";
	schema:reviewBody "I still remember when it was reported Clark Gable had had a heart attack shortly after completing The Misfits. It happened just before Election Day because there was a news item and it's mentioned in at least one Gable biography that he voted by absentee ballot in 1960. Shortly after that he died and the world was waiting the birth of his son and his last posthumous film.No doubt about it Gable does look all of his 59 years in the Misfits. But he's still exudes that gruff animal magnetism that leaves you no doubt as to why Marilyn Monroe was finding him so sexy. It's an interesting and challenging role for Gable his Gay Langland is a bitter multilayered character whose family has deserted him and his way of life is vanishing. All three of the men Gable Monty Clift and Eli Wallach have a deathly fear of working for wages expressed often during The Misfits.For Monty Clift it's more than fear. He's also bitter about being cheated out of his father's ranch by a stepfather who offers him wages. So he's taken to the rodeo circuit but he's also past his prime in that dangerous sport. Eli Wallach starts out as what we think is a deep sensitive portrayal but as we go along we find there's less than meets the eye. He wants Marilyn Monroe real bad who wouldn't and it's clear he's just using some of his best lines in his quest for her.Marilyn as eastern divorce to be serves as the group's conscience when they start going after mustangs for dog food manufacturers. Quite illegally of course but that's part of the challenge for this group. Lots of shots of Marilyn's bulges both front and rear are another good reason to see this film.Towards the end the wild mustangs on the Nevada desert take over the film from the human actors. They are a kind of doppleganger for this group they are also misfits with no place in the modern world for them except as canned dog food.Those roping stunts and Clark Gable being dragged by a horse probably put a strain on his cardiovascular system. It's been written that Marilyn was the cause of his demise. Pure and utter nonsense. I can't believe John Huston the director let him do those scenes. Why wasn't a stunt double used? Marilyn Monroe was one royal pain to work with what with all of her issues but that surely had nothing to do with what happened to Gable.The Misfits still holds up well after over 40 years. All of the cast can be proud of their work in that film.".

He wants Marilyn Monroe real bad who wouldn't and it's clear he's just using some of his best lines in his quest for her.Marilyn as eastern divorce to be serves as the group's conscience when they start going after mustangs for dog food manufacturers. Quite illegally of course but that's part of the challenge for this group. Lots of shots of Marilyn's bulges both front and rear are another good reason to see this film.Towards the end the wild mustangs on the Nevada desert take over the film from the human actors. They are a kind of doppleganger for this group they are also misfits with no place in the modern world for them except as canned dog food.Those roping stunts and Clark Gable being dragged by a horse probably put a strain on his cardiovascular system. It's been written that Marilyn was the cause of his demise. Pure and utter nonsense. I can't believe John Huston the director let him do those scenes. Why wasn't a stunt double used? Marilyn Monroe was one royal pain to work with what with all of her issues but that surely had nothing to do with what happened to Gable.The Misfits still holds up well after over 40 years. All of the cast can be proud of their work in that film.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Misfits is famous for being the last completed film of two cultural icons Clark Gable and Marilyn Monroe.  It brings the two famous stars into the then current year of 1961.This is a movie about a woman in Reno Nevada where else? who is there to get a divorce.  On a whim she makes up her mind fast! she drives out to the desert on the day of her divorce with a washed out aging cowboy Clark Gable and his buddy Eli Wallach as well as her friend Thelma Ritter. This begins a wistful adventure and sometimes sad relationship for her with the cowboy and his misfit friends including Montgomery Clift.  They grapple with life's issues from divorce friendship greed and even cruelty until finally everyone's character and philosophy of life is laid bare in a showdown over 6 wild horses.This is an underrated cinematic gem...and I can see why.  The first time I saw this movie a few years ago I thought it was beautiful and well done but sad and too depressing with a vague ending.  Recently I couldn't pass it by because of it's place in movie history when I saw it on DVD for just 5.88! What a shock I got watching this one on my big screen TV in the original widescreen format in glorious black and white.  It was so fantastically fascinating from beginning to end that I watched it twice in a row.  Marilyn Monroe is an amazing actress and she brings Rosalyn Tabor to life in this film.  She's riveting and not because of her fantastic looks.  What a thrill!  Clark Gable inhabits his character Gay like he's in his own skin making him a man you can respect and sympathize with.  Montgomery Clift Eli Wallach and Thelma Ritter are all incredible in their roles.  I don't know how I missed so much the first time I saw this move.  It has humor pathos and drama.  The great John Houston directs it brilliantly! The cinematography is nothing short of breathtaking and the editing is sheer genius.  It's an overlooked cinematic gem and I recommend it!  Watch it twice if you're don't see the joy and hope in this film the first time. It's there!  This crew hs created a near mastepiece.  Keep following that same bright star.  I rate this a 91100.  Don't miss seing it in the widescreen format on a big screen TV.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is about despair. Despair at the passing of a way of life. Despair at disappointed hopes and dreams. Despair at the loss of a loved one either through death divorce or disinterest. Knowing that going in and if you don't mind downbeat films there are some really moving performances from a cast full of legends.Heavy with gloom there is still much too admire though Miller's prose is at times heavy and tending towards pretension. Marilyn's woozy sexuality coming through a haze of pills and booze at times still suits her character's searching and displaced loneliness. Clark Gable accepted his part after first choice Robert Mitchum passed. Mitchum would have been great of course and publicly stated he regretted not taking the role since he and Marilyn were longtime friends before both were famous he had worked with her first husband and he felt that around him she would have been able to pull herself together as she had on River of No Return. This was the end of the line for Gable and his weathered appearance and weariness actually suits the role better than Mitchum's ruggedness would have at that point. The film contains some of the best acting Clark ever did.Clift and his sad broken looks make a powerful impact and Wallach scores well too but the great Thelma Ritter is somewhat shortchanged since she disappears about halfway through the picture. Her astringent tartness would have been most welcome later in the film when the real heavy going takes place.".

	schema:headline " Overshadowed by its macabre 'trivia' The Misfits is nonetheless a powerful hymn to life love and freedom...";
	schema:reviewBody "Celebrating the 25th anniversary of Marilyn Monroe's death each of Ebert and Siskel selected two of her most defining work. All naturally the choices went to her last films both in black andwhite both perfectly capturing the actress' true potential in comedy Billy Wilder's Some Like it Hot and drama John Huston's The Misfits. Watching these two films is almost enough to understand Marilyn Monroe.The screenplay was written by then Monroe's husband Arthur Miller so the similarities between Roslyn and Marilyn two rhyming names is no coincidence. Marilyn Monroe is not only the most iconic actress of Hollywood's Golden Age but the most tragic a woman who attracted men but never kept them who inspired lust while longing for love. The confusion she lived through during her tenyear career forged her reputation as an actress difficult to work with the relationship with Miller would also be affected by her antics and they would divorce shortly after the film. So the Marilyn we see is in the same emotional state than the fresh divorce Roslyn. And when The Misifts ends and Roslyn is left on her own again she could as well die like Monroe one year after of a suicide or accidental overdose. No one could have predicted that this was Marilyn's swan song but she couldn't have a better one. I don't think she could have let her feelings be so fulsomely imploded as she did in The Misfits. The performance of Monroe like a delicate flower dancing over a volcano is crucial to the film because it is truthful.There's a moment where Gay the rugged and tough cowboy played by Clark Gable gently gazes at her and says you're the saddest girl I ever saw. She says I usually heard that I was happy That's because you make people happy he says. There are two truths behind this exchange. First you can ooze happiness without being happy like a defensive mechanism one that didn't fool Roslyn's friend played by Thelma Ritter a woman who learned to be happy by proxy. The second truth is that it takes an unhappy person to spot another one. And as Gay Clark Gable's performance is equally heartbreaking.As the tall dark and handsome leading man Gable was never allowed to fully express his acting potentiality except for Gone With the Wind but as Gay the freespirited gentle cowboy Gable knew this was the role of a lifetime to transition through actors not stars' roles. Gay is a man of a dying breed his catchphrase is better than the wages and with his friend Guido played by Eli Wallash he enjoys the idle freedom from which 9to5 schmucks are deprived of in their castrating lives. They chase mustangs and women watch rodeos drink booze but somewhat they're as sour and unhappy as Roslyn. They're the misfits pure 'Hustonian' losers trying to catch their dreams like lassoing a running stallion you might get the animal but not its spirit. The Misfits might have disconcerted audiences and critics because of their erratic behavior. One moment life is worth being enjoyed every second of it and the moment after it's pure purposelessness. But Huston's confident directing and Miller's screenplay allow a few outbursts of emotions to each character so the anger can steam out even a drunken Gay desperately cries for his lost children and this is perhaps the greatest acting moment of Gable's career pathetic but certainly not pitiful. Monroe has a similar moment during the film's climactic hunting sequence. These scenes work because most of the time they all talk about life death stars wilderness manhood or kindness but at any moment the communication can derail and makes the whole emotional edifice fall apart. There's a moment where Guido recalls his war experience and loss of his wife and how it left him immune to guilt and compassion but he admires Roslyn's gift for love and is ready to change if she accepts him but then why such a man would need a reason to show heart? There's also Perce played by Montgomery Clift a young rodeo man who seems to have taken so many rides he probably lost track. Roslyn can't stand the savage sight of rodeo nor his selfdestructive impulses but Perce is surprisingly the least tortured of the group. He's a man who doesn't know much about his future but knows the past he's trying to escape from and he takes what comes to him. As they say maybe all there really is is the next thing.It's Perce who cuts the horses loose as an act of mercy for a woman too empathetic for her own good but look at Gay's reaction he catches the stallion lets himself being dragged on the ground and and in a pure Hustonian move struggles but ultimately tames it and lets it go. Why did he bother catching him? He doesn't want someone making decisions for him. He knew it was the right thing to do that this horse shouldn't pay for the ugliness of this world something he shouldn't be part of but it's still up to him to decide. Gable would die of a stroke a few days after filming in November 1960 the exhaustion from the film might have killed him but like he says one who's afraid to die is afraid to live. He embraced his character as fully as Monroe.Being the swan song of two acting legends and one of the last from Montgomery Clift about which Monroe said he was the first person she met in a worse shape than her this film might be appreciated less as film but as a document seeing actors you know they're in the twilight of their lives in an almost voyeuristic way. Maybe. But that doesn't take anything from the film paraphrasing Huston The Misfits is the stuff legends are made on even on a posthumous level.".

	schema:headline " In A Special Category of Film Legend  Following a Star in the Night";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie has generated a huge following in since it was made due to the acting by it's leads and directing John Huston but it is best known as the final movie of the stars. It was the final film for Clark Gable. Indeed it killed Gable due to the scene where he stupidly did his own stunt of trying to restrain a wild horse. However it was not the last film for Marilyn Monroe. She began work on a film with George Cukor which she was fired from and which was never completed. Since Monty Clift was also in it many people claim it was his last film too. Actually he made several complete films after it including FREUD also by John Huston. Thelma Ritter lived until 1969 and she was still making plenty of films until then. Estelle Winwood would reach her 100th year and was still making films up to a decade before that. As for Kevin McCarthy and Eli Wallach  they are both 'bless 'em going strong. However the final scene of the script gave a coda to Gable's and Monroe's career. This helps make the public point of view about the film understandable. In his later years Gable popped up in a series of films where his costar was a leading lady of similar popular following who was usually younger than him but his feminine sexual equivalent. These included TEACHER'S PET with Doris Day and IT STARTED IN NAPLES with Sophia Loren. The film he did with Monroe their only film together was THE MISFITS and it was not a comedy. THE MISFITS was supposed to be a philosophical drama about why people can't be loners but have to find their way into some group where they are acceptable to each other. Philosophical films are very difficult ones to turn into box office gold. People go to films as an escape and rarely to feed their brains. But Marilyn's then husband dramatist Arthur Miller wrote the screenplay for the film. At the time the MillerMonroe marriage was collapsing and this may be why the screenplay seems to be lopsided. Marilyn's character Rosalind Taber seems to be flighty at points but at other points too deep. We first see her willing to get through her divorce with Kevin McCarthy who does a lot with his one brief scene in the film trying to stop the divorce. This shows determination  she even gives a vague reason to McCarthy that it was his fault for keeping her on the shelf while he concentrated on his career. Yet she shows a flakiness too. She tells Thelma Ritter she never wants to see an expensive car that was given to her again.This follows her throughout the film. She is introduced to these modern cowboys through cab driver Eli Wallach Guido and she takes an offer from him to go up to his country house to chill out. Gable and Ritter accompany them. But soon she is showing a different personality she is a motherearth figure. Wallach is an ex military pilot who was married but whose wife died in a fluke situation while pregnant his car lacked a tire and he could not rush her to the hospital. Marilyn tries to get to the bottom of Wallach's feelings and it is obvious that Wallach does not want to discuss this. Gable Gay Langdon seems more settled  but we learn that daughter and son keep him at arm's length due to his tendency to carouse and get drunk. Marilyn and Gable do turn each other on but Marilyn is upset by Gable's matteroffact feelings about animals like horses and rabbits.Montgomery Clift Perce Howland comes in later in the film when he joins the group headed for a rodeo. All of them have attended rodeos except Monroe. She is horrified at the injuries the cowboys get. Clift gets injured but while he and the other men accept his injuries as normal Monroe wants to scream about them. Clift also has personal family problems his mother remarried and the man has basically pushed Clift out of his property rights to his father's ranch. But the lack of his mother's interest in him she is totally enthralled by the new husband is what hurts him the most.Even the fifth wheel of this ensemble Ritter Isabelle Steers has a serious family problem that makes her a misfit albeit one who has learned to accept it. Her husband left her for a best friend of her's years before and has never paid her alimony  he sends her a potted rose once a year. At the end she leaves the film before the conclusion she meets the husband and her best friend at the rodeo and they go to her home to spend a few days! Ritter's character is a realist when she is not involved  she keeps warning Marilyn about cowboys and their ways  but she can be remarkably weak in defending her own rights and feelings.How they all come to terms or fail to come to terms with their family and personality failures is what I leave to the viewers. It is worthwhile to watch this film to it's emotional climax the scene with the wild horses where Monroe's character finally gets her real voice  and Monroe achieved her acting height outside of her performance as Cherie in BUS STOP. But it is achieved at a ridiculous cost as mentioned before Gable had to do his own stunt in that scene. The followup scene really shows how he was too old for it.There is also that lovely coda Clark and Marilyn in the pickup truck looking at the star in the sky that Clark says is his guide. It does sort of seem an appropriate signoff for those two movie icons.".

	schema:reviewBody "Marilyn Monroe's breathy voice and little girl sweetness have a depth and reason in this film that most of her other roles lacked. The Misfits written by Monroe's exhusband Arthur Miller is as harsh and dark as his relationship with the actress apparently was. While overwritten and plodding the dialog has an earthy reality that seeps out from time to time aided in no small way by John Huston's excellent direction and stunning cinematography. Marilyn's equally iconic costars  Clark Gable Montgomery Clift Eli Wallach Thelma Ritter  realize their parts with finesse and feeling. But Monroe stands out in this modern day psychological western  not for her beauty or glamor  but for a contemplative strength and tragic emotion the actress seldom revealed on screen. She seemed to be emerging from her sexpot shell in her impersonation of a drifting divorce drawn to a trio of struggling yet oddly aimless Nevada ranch hands. Her expressions and mannerisms are natural at times weighted with a sadness a tiredness that may not have been acting at all. Whether intentional or not these facial shots of grief and pain are exquisitely disturbing as much for their fleshing out Marilyn's personal travail at the time the movie was made as for the mixedup character she was playing.Her sensitivity to the plight of the wild horses the ranchers are capturing and killing for illegal profit is brilliantly wellpaced her anguished dialog in defense of their freedom evocative of larger social issues coming to the fore in the 1960s. The poignant scenes of her outrage at the men's treatment of the horses are in fact seething in their intensity giving the viewer a tantalizing glimpse of the caliber of talent Marilyn held in reserve and would likely have expressed to greater acclaim had she lived longer. As it turned out The Misfits with all its pathos and desolation underscored by sweeping desert backdrops was Monroe's last film. Perhaps unavoidably it's regarded by many as a metaphor for Marilyn's own professional and private turmoil.And it may be. But it's also a splendid tribute to the range of her abilities. More than any other movie in which she appeared the hauntingly heroic if flawed tale of The Misfits is the finest most compellingly honest work Marilyn Monroe ever achieved.".

	schema:reviewBody "Every age has its misfits. Some were burnt at the stake long ago others still tramp the dark streets of our cites. But like everybody they had and still have their beliefs. So while this intense drama is about a group of people who seem oddball it's really all about people  just like you and me  trying to figure what to believe in...And it just so happens that Arthur Miller used the American cowboy as his metaphor to explore that central human concern. As an aside I found out that Arthur Miller wrote the screenplay while in Reno waiting for his divorce to be finalized significantly the film opens with the character of Roslyn getting her divorce from an abusive husband.There's the delightful Marilyn Monroe as Roslyn Taber in her next to last movie trying to find a man worthy enough to believe in Clark Gable in his last movie as Gay Langland the restless older cowboy  resourceful independent strong but with a touch of cynicism  who's attracted to Roslyn despite himself the always vulnerable Montgomery Clift as Perce Howland who drifts from rodeo to rodeo trying to forget his past and then there's the everpresent Eli Wallach  one of Hollywood's greatest  playing the widower Guido who can't forget his past but for all the wrong reasons.All three men are of course attracted to Roslyn and all the while Thelma Ritter as Isabelle Stears and an older friend of Roslyn's tries to help her sort out what she should do.Together the group stay for a while at Guido's unfinished house out near the Nevada desert and it is there that Roslyn decides she will try to live with Gay for a while to see if things work out for them both. But it is only when she accompanies all three men on a camping foray into the desert to round up some mustangs that Roslyn finds out what all three men truly believe in. When she does find out she's no happy camper no pun intended that's for sure  except in the case of Perce.The stark black and white camera work especially in the desert night is hauntingly beautiful reminding me very much of the photography in Pursued 1947 perhaps still the finest example of Western night filming. The action during the hunt for the mustangs is intense grueling and exhausting. So much so that the viewer can almost feel it. And the editing is just excellent as the cowboys bring down each horse one by one leaving the stallion to last in a final great tussle in a Clark Gable biographical documentary I saw I found out that he did much of the heavy work in those scenes no mean feat for an aging star in his sixtieth year. Sadly of course Gable did have a heart attack two days after filming ended and died nine days later.If you haven't seen this classic film I think you should. Not only Gable's best in my opinion but also one of the best of John Huston's directorial efforts.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've only just recently begun exploring many of the older films I've heard of but never taken the time to watch. The Misfits is one such film. I've watched it twice now and am preparing to watch it a third time. There are so many layers of fascination here that it's hard to separate them out.As a selfacknowledged Marilyn Monroe admirer I sometimes identify with Elton John collaborator Bernie Taupin's claim that I too see her as something more than sexual though I must admit that it's sexuality that best defines our Norma Jean. There is nothing wrong with sexuality. It is quite possibly the most common of human traits. But there is something in Monroe's sexuality that goes well beyond that articulated through her popular image. There have been many Monroe pretenders but none has quite captured the underlying vulnerability that could only have come from something not contrived but inherent in her nature. After viewing this film I'm convinced that Arthur Miller that most insightful of mid20th Century American playwrights must have examined it up close and been as fascinated as the rest of us at its mystifying origin. I have no doubt that Miller wrote this screenplay for his then estranged wife. He wondered at her unpredictability her wildness her revulsion at being roped in and ground up for mass consumption. All this must have contrasted strangely with the popular assumption that America's Blonde Bombshell must be little more than a dumb dolt with nothing more complicated than golddigging on her mind. Miss Monroe's character Roslyn is what some might call a touchstone. An emblem of unfathomable beauty a sometimes overly credulous sentimentality and painful vulnerability. She above all else in this picture  beyond the cowboys the mountains and the mustangs  is the mythical character a woman whose grace transcends her flaws whose manifested ideals however unsophisticated to the sophisticated eye move the people in her life at least to glimpse if never conquer their own foibles. As has become my custom with these old films I watched at least once then looked up old reviews to see how my own impressions mesh with opinions of the times. It's an exercise of sorts to see how time has treated these old icons and an intellectual excursion as well to match my own perceptions against the pros. In this case the New York Times review by Bosley Crowther dated Feb. 2 1961 caused a particular reaction. It's not unusual that I'd disagree with a critic but this one seemed to illustrate how critics can go so fantastically wrong. Crowther appeared to connect not at all with the film its characters or even the theme it sought to convey. Mr. Crowther mockingly ironically perhaps sincerely though I doubt it commends the characters in The Misfits as something other than status seekers or organization men. He says this is the one thing he can say for them though I suspect he says this with an undercurrent of dismissal rather than the compliment he feigns. In the end he calls them 'tramps as though grasping at any trace of recognition for creatures he's never himself encountered outside of a cursory pass at the fringes of some Manhattan sidewalk. Not that I begrudge Crowther his world view. Though I must admit a smidgen of resentment at the shear power of its expression given the vehicle the NY Times of its export.I can't help but feel that Crowther and others like him may have played some small role in Monroe's demise. Like the character she plays in Misfits the story of Norma Jean's life was the search for acceptance  first by any means possible and at the end for something deeper than the skin for which she'd become so famous. I could forgive Crowther more easily if he'd simply said These are tragic characters their mundane lives rendered masterfully by an ensemble of stars who'd long ago abandoned the everyday for 'stardom.' It will never play in New York but isn't it interesting they inhabit a world New Yorkers long for but could never really want? This is a great movie for what it tries to say. Does it succeed? I've yet to see one succeed more completely. And that is incomplete praise I know. But the true stories of the West have been left mostly untold. So Mr. Huston and company must be acknowledged for trying and trying so passionately to express the tales of misfit cowboys discarded women and goddesses in mortal flesh who descend to deliver a message of honesty and intimacy and compassion.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Misfits is wellknown for being the last completed film of two of the most iconic stars in film history Clark Gable the man who became known as the King of Hollywood and Marilyn Monroe the woman who at the height of her fame had a good claim to be its Queen. Gable was to die of a heart attack a few days after finishing shooting Monroe was to die less than two years later before Something's Gotta Give which would have been her next film was finished. It was eventually completed under the title Move Over Darling with Doris Day in the leading role. The film is a modernday Western an example of the genre which transfers classic Western situations to a contemporary setting or explores the relevance of the mythos of the Old West to modern America. Other examples include Bad Day at Black Rock Lonely Are the Brave and The Electric Cowboy. Two of the three main male characters Gay Langland and Perce Howland are Nevada cowboys the third is their friend Guido a truck driver. The plot revolves around the romantic friendship which grows up between Gay and Roslyn Tabor a much younger woman who has travelled to Reno to get a quickie divorce from her husband and around the three men's scheme to round up wild mustangs to sell. The relationship between Gay and the animalloving Roslyn is placed under stress when she learns that the captured mustangs are not simply going to be domesticated and used for riding as she had originally assumed but killed for dog food. The title The Misfits refers to the men's description of the mustangs as misfit horses but there is a clear implication that it refers to the four main characters as well. All of them seem to have difficulty fitting in somewhere whether into a steady job into a relationship like Roslyn Gay is a divorcee or into society as a whole. The film was written by Arthur Miller directed by John Huston and besides Gable and Monroe starred actors of the quality of Montgomery Clift Eli Wallach and Thelma Ritter. Despite this stellar lineup however the film was not very popular when first released. Even the death of a star as beloved as Gable did not arouse much interest in his last film. It was not quite the commercial disaster which some have claimed it just about broke even at the boxoffice but certainly was not the success its makers were hoping for. Contemporary critical opinion was not entirely enthusiastic either but today the film seems to be more highly regarded than it was in 1961. Having recently watched it for the first time in a number of years however I am not really convinced. Certainly Gable is good in his last role as the grizzled leathery old cowboy Gay but I have always been in two minds about Monroe's performance. Yes she was strikingly beautiful in her midthirties more so in fact than she had been a decade earlier. Monroe's beauty moreover went deeper than mere good looks. She was able to radiate charisma expressing more strongly than ever in this film that mixture of desirability and vulnerability which had always been her stockintrade. She was not however always a technically proficient actress and here her shortcomings in this direction are often apparent. She always spoke in a breathy highpitched voice and here this feature becomes so exaggerated that her lines often become inaudible. To be fair to Marilyn this film was made at a difficult time in her life when she was feeling like a misfit herself. Miller her third husband had described his script as a Valentine to her but their marriage broke down during the making of the film putting Monroe into a similar position to that of her character. She had turned to drink and drugs to help her cope and production was shut down for a time so she could attend a hospital for detox. Nor was she the only one who had problems of this nature. Director Huston was drinking and gambling heavily and even turned up drunk on set. Nevada notorious for its liberal gambling laws was perhaps not the ideal location for a man with a gambling problem. In the circumstances therefore it is perhaps not surprising that Monroe's farewell performance is perhaps not the best of her career or that Huston's direction is not at its most fluent. The first half of the movie in particular is very slow and meandering and never seems to be going anywhere. The film comes to life more in the second half the mustanghunting scene is genuinely exciting and the romance between Roslyn and Gay becomes more interesting as it seems that she will have to choose between her love of animals and her love for a man whose whole way of life is cast around the assumption that animals are just another commodity. Given all the talents that went into making it however The Misfits could have been a much better film than it is. 510".

The film comes to life more in the second half the mustanghunting scene is genuinely exciting and the romance between Roslyn and Gay becomes more interesting as it seems that she will have to choose between her love of animals and her love for a man whose whole way of life is cast around the assumption that animals are just another commodity. Given all the talents that went into making it however The Misfits could have been a much better film than it is. 510";

It's just too easy to extract the symbolism from this film as it relates to the passing of it's principal stars so soon after it's release.

Of course there's only one Marilyn Monroe and if you weren't thinking it Gable's character manages to chime in to remind us that 'She's real prime.There have been many films about the passing of the Old West but none that have come so close to the modern era to state it's message.

Monty Monroe and Wallach all came up in the 'method' tradition and when Gable tries that approach it has almost a humorous outcome. I'm referring to the scene when he literally cracks when he finds that his kids have abandoned him at the hotel climbing up on a car and falling off for dramatic effect yelling at the top of his lungs.

I don't know enough about Arthur Miller's script to know the answer and have only now seen the film for the first time but it's an interesting exercise to think through.For the male leads there's no doubt that they all turned in exceptional performances here. For those who have the 'Some Like it Hot' image of Marilyn Monroe this is the picture to convince you that maybe she had some talent after all.

	schema:reviewBody "This film and its generally poor reception is a good example of what happens when huge marketing mistakes are made. Take a look at the cover of the DVD package Stallone Judge Dredd. The film should have been titled Judge Dredd  even in the packaging  and the emphasis for the marketing of this film should have been less Stallone more content. On the flipside when the most consistent complaint you can find among IMDb psychofants is HE TOOK OFF HIS HELMET! you really have to wonder if the film is quite as bad as so many believe. Eagle Comics 2000 AD character Judge Dredd was one of the most original entertaining and intelligently written and interestingly drawn scifi comics of recent times. With story arcs varying from 2 pages worth of panels to 4 or 5 episodes and sometimes multithreaded plots this violent political and tough cyberpunk version of Dirty Harry set some pretty high standards for adult comic authorship both in its native UK and in the USA once the imports started flowing in. It freely traversed from film noir to flatout wild scifi action to nihilistic hard justice and did so with style and originality rarely seen in the comic medium. Hence although I like Stallone in this film it's not only misleading but a little insulting to call this 'a Stallone film'. The producers had very big shoes to fill and though I am in the minority here I believe they did well.The production team chose a story arc which I was never very fond of but one of the more doable ones to be sure. Any Dreddbased film would necessitate a huge special effects budget and most of them even with the best special effects available would likely be nearly impossible to pull off and might look ridiculous. To their credit the Return of Rico story arc was rightfully recognized as good film material  it involves more emotional content than the usual Dredd fare and actually required fewer outrageous special effects than say the many Judge Death arcs might have.Dredd is a street judge  and the judges are the closest thing to a government in a postapocalyptic future where nuclear war has concentrated all of the world's population into megacities  hotbeds of crime and chaos surrounded by mutagenic wastelands called The Cursed Earth. Dredd is the best of the best a very tough cop who knows method theory and has an incorrigible sense of ethics and dedication to the law. Dredd is also mentor to an entire generation of judges including the brilliant Hershey Lane. Rico Dredd's former best friend and a psychotic murderer escapes from a high security prison with some help from a fascistic leader of the judges who is bent on securing power and a new world order with himself in charge. Soon Dredd is framed for murder and exiled to the wastelands and judges start to die all over the city. About midway through the film Dredd learns the truth of his relationship to Rico and begins to figure out the sinister plot. Of course there is only one thing for him to do  return to Megalopolis to stop the conspiracy before it plays out.The film features good performances by a really nice cast. Armand Assante brings the character of Rico to life better than the comic book ever did. Diane Lane Jurgen Prochnow and Max Von Sydow are always good and though I had my doubts to begin with Stallone pulls off Dredd very well. While some folks complain about Rob Schneider's irritating behavior I found that his goofy character took a little of the edge off of Stallone's depressive performance of the most stoic law enforcement officer on planet earth. This is not one of Joan Chen's better roles. If you're a big Chen fan you might think twice about seeing this.All considered I see Judge Dredd as a underrated and mismarketed film which through its fast pace sophisticated scifi plot Excellent special effects and very good cast took all of the screenable elements of the comic book and made them accessible to an audience a bit wider than its original fanbase. If this review peaks your interest see it!".

I don't see too many movies based on comic book superheroes that I honestly enjoyed.  X Men for example went on too long moved very slowly and took itself too seriously.  Judge Dredd is a fastpaced scifiaction thrill ride that delivers from start to finish and has help in the comic relief department by Rob Schneider.  Sylvester Stallone overacts throughout but that's part of the fun.  Watching him scream out I AM THE LAW!! makes you want to scream it out along with him which is what I do whenever I view this movie.  There are many quotable lines which I enjoy reciting.  Judge Dredd is not a deeply intelligent insightful film.  But it makes a great popcorn flick!  This upbeat funny nonstop entertainment is a real treat for me to watch over and over again.  My score  8 out of 10".

	schema:headline " Delivers thoughtprovoking action in a fantasy scifi wrapping";
	schema:reviewBody "Judge Dredd is based on one of the most popular characters from the UK's 2000 AD comics. It is set in the 22nd Century when most of the Earth has been turned into a desolate wasteland known as the Cursed Earth and most humans live in highly concentrated cities walled off from the rest of the world. Society is fairly anarchic except there for a class of humans known as judges who act as cop judge jury and executioner all rolled into one. Sylvester Stallone is the titular judge. He's notorious among the other judges the general citizenry and the other judges for upholding the law in a harsh way. The film primarily tells the story arc from the comics known as The Return of Rico and concerns a plot to get Dredd into trouble while overthrowing what's left of the existing order.This is a great actionscifi film with a tone reminiscent of Demolition Man 1993 Total Recall 1990 The Fifth Element 1997 Blade Runner 1982 and similar films. If you like Stallone gloomy futuristic production design andor intense action films Judge Dredd should be a rewarding experience for you as long as you're not a purist who is coming to the film by way of an intricate familiarity with the 2000 AD comics.The source material caused a slight problem for me too but not because I'm a purist. Rather Judge Dredd suffers a bit from a flaw that plagues many films based on comic bookswriters Michael De Luca William Wisher Jr. and Steven E. de Souza had an extensive preexistent mythology as is necessary when creating a complete new world on which to build their work and they tried to incorporate a bit too much of it. Because of this we're introduced to a large cast of characters fulfilling functions that we're not familiar with in the details at least and we're regularly faced with new lingo new cultural concepts new technology and so on often with just a couple lines of dialogue. If you want to understand the details you really have to pay close attention. But on the other hand the general arc of the story is relatively simple and you don't have to know every detail to enjoy it.Given the disposition that Stallone has as Judge Dredd in the film he may as well have walked out of Kurt Wimmer's film Equilibrium 2002. Dredd initially goes about his business almost robotically he only cares about enforcing the law. When he's recruited by a higherup Chief Justice Fargo Max von Sydow to teach ethics which is quite an ironic idea when you see Dredd's behavior in the opening scene he tells the students that being a judge basically means giving up one's life to the law. He says that one cannot have friends for examplenever mind that other judges like Judge Hershey Diane Lane try to have social lives outside of work. Dredd later tells Hershey that he did have a friend at one point but he had to judge him. Sending a friend to prison or killing him we're not told exactly how Dredd judged him although we find out later isn't exactly the best way to encourage a healthy social life.So the subtext of the story and Dredd's character arc becomes that through a number of hardships he finally learns something about ethics for himselfjust in time to deal with a potentially shattering bit of information about his personal identity. He ends up accompanied by a man Herman Ferguson Rob Schneider in a role meant primarily as comic relief although more generously he's an ironic emotional facilitator whom he had just judged harshly even though Ferguson wasn't really doing anything wrong on his first day out of prison. Together they have to go to a figurative hell The Cursed Earth to deal with figurative demons a famed band of rogue cannibals who live in the tough environment and back again to reach their fulfillment.Like many recent scifi stories set in the future Judge Dredd has a pessimistic view of where technology and social conventions are leading humans. As the story has it at one point we had built massive relatively unstoppable robot warriors and one of the highlights of the film is when the villain finds one and puts it back into service. It's as much fun to watch the gadgetry as it is to watch the action sequences and the computer generated landscapes throughout the film are spellbinding with their sly jabs at various changes and similarities to present locations and cultures. The whole concept of the judges and their hierarchical structure is fascinating even if some apparent inconsistencies such as why judges are not summarily dealt with in the same manner that other citizens are are never explained in the film.The performances are good even if a few actors barely get enough screen time like Lane and Joan Chen who plays semivillain Ilsa and the premise is captivating. It's too bad this film gets unduly knocked by purists and those misguidedly looking for detail realism in the genre. Judge Dredd is severely underrated on IMDb. It deserves a first look or a second chance.".

He escapes and is on a mission to try and find the person who set him up.Anyone that has read the comics hated this film due to the fact that is apparently so different to the comics. From what I have been told Dredd never takes off his helmet and reveals his face. Not in this film. His helmet is taken off within 15 minutes of the movies start. I never read the comic so I don't know any other differences but that is probably why I enjoyed it.This film has a very 90s feel to it. It reminds me in a way to Demolition Man. They are both set in the future and are both really good action movies although Demolition Man is better. I do love the action films from the 90s. They have a good over the top feel to them.The acting is alright in it considering it is a cheesy action movie. The movie stars Sylvester Stallone as Dredd. He looks uncomfortable in this role some of the time but then Stallone does not suit some roles. A young Diane Lane plays his partner. She does a pretty good job. I was very surprised to see a cameo from one of my favourite singers the legendary Ian Dury. He only had a very small part but he was really good.The effects and explosions were really good and well done. But that is what was expected from the action films of that era. The gun fights were completely over the top too in a good way. I also loved the giant robot in the film. It was one of my favourite characters.If you like cheese Sly Stallone futuristic films and never read the Dredd comics then I can't see why you would hate this.I will give it 7 out of 10.I am the law!For more reviews please like my Facebook pagehttpswww.facebook.compagesOrdinaryPersonMovie Reviews456572047728204?refhl".

	schema:reviewBody "Firstly I am not a reader of the Judge Dredd comic books so I have nothing to compare Stallone's Judge Dredd to but honestly I loved this movie and cannot imagine any other actor playing this role. I've heard people say that Dredd should not remove his helmet but that did not bother me one bit. The action in the movie ranks along side some of Stallone's best and the movie is entertaining from start to finish. I think that Rico is a good villain played to perfection by Armand Assante and Diane Lane is superb as Judge Hershey providing all of the emotion and human qualities that are devoid from Judge Dredd therefore intensifying the character of Dredd. Fergie is also a good character played well by Rob Schneider who creates a sense of humour making the film not just about raw action. Judge Dredd as a popcorn movie is superb it was never going to win Oscars but at the end of the day that is not the point of the film. It is intended to be pure Stallonefuelled entertainment and on this level it is a resounding success.".

This thing is amazingly good and entertaining throwaway cheese.  There is zero originality here.  This is Blade Runner meets Demolition Man meets Texas Chainsaw massacre meets Superman 2 meets Star Wars Trilogy.  This movie is almost a replica of Demolition Man but is tons more fun.  Stallone like in Demolition Man plays a supercop.  He's accused of a crime he didn't commit and is punished like in Demolition Man.  There are other parallels along the way.  He meets a Texas Chainsaw Massacre family in his exile with an android member who looks suspiciously like Terry Bradshaw.  Armand Assante is really great as the villain Diane Lane excels in a role that doesn't fit her and Rob Schneider is stunningly endearing as the third wheel in a party of two.  Max Von Sydow and Jurgen Prochnow add their talents to give the movie a seasoned flavor.  Stallone's intro is pathetic but he excels along the way.  The digital effects also work themselves into the story very well.  I'm stunned at how good this thing is upon reviewing it.".

Assante is a strong villain and the council is full of famous faces.  Lane has nothing to do as Judge Hershey.Overall this is a cartoon for teenagers and those just looking for lots of bangs.  However even for that crowd this may prove a little basic  I wanted it to be more sophisticated than it was and be darker but not just violent as it has been misinterpreted as here.

Judge Dredd was one of themSince I popped this movie in I have watched it at the very least two dozen times. I watched it once today once yesterday twice the day before that three times the day before that twice the day before that... and I have a decent selection of other films to choose from. This movie is addictive. It has this pacing and style that while not very realistic and certainly not worthy of an Oscar it just makes you grin. Every time the Alan Silvestri Dredd theme pops up I just smile... from the Gianni Versace designed Dredd Armor to the topnotch special effects this movie brings together many elements into a 96 minute ride of pure cheese that keeps getting better each time you watch itThe CG can be beautiful at times even to the point of photorealism and certainly outdoes the the horrid cartooniness of Blade 2's or XMen's CG...You just have to watch it to believe how addictive this damn thing is'Nuff Said".

Judge Dredd was one of themSince I popped this movie in I have watched it at the very least two dozen times. I watched it once today once yesterday twice the day before that three times the day before that twice the day before that... and I have a decent selection of other films to choose from. This movie is addictive. It has this pacing and style that while not very realistic and certainly not worthy of an Oscar it just makes you grin. Every time the Alan Silvestri Dredd theme pops up I just smile... from the Gianni Versace designed Dredd Armor to the topnotch special effects this movie brings together many elements into a 96 minute ride of pure cheese that keeps getting better each time you watch itThe CG can be beautiful at times even to the point of photorealism and certainly outdoes the the horrid cartooniness of Blade 2's or XMen's CG...You just have to watch it to believe how addictive this damn thing is'Nuff Said";

This really never puts you back an inch while you are on the edge of your seat. It is great although I would have liked it bloodier show how they rip Prochnow's arms and legs of and show how that human is barbecued. While I am at the bad stuff I feel that the effects were pretty poor sometimes although that didn't bother me that much I still enjoyed it. What bothers me that at 93 minutes this film seems heavily cut or why does the lab at the end just start exploding and why didn't I see one clone moving around.

So obviously the film holds very personal emotions for me and as such I have to admit that I had a negative bias from the start. Anyway enough about me.The film started and I was very impressed with the visual effects and design. At first I thought Judge Dredd's uniform was way over the top even more than the comic version. However after remembering the visual style of films like Flash Gordon 1980 I put that down to personal preference.One of the problems is Sylvester Stallone's Performance. I am not one of Sly's detractors I have enjoyed his performances in films such as Rocky First Blood Paradise Alley Copland and even Demolition Man. However this performance bares no resemblance to the character of Judge Dredd.Stallone's character lacks the authority and quiet confidence of Judge Dredd. Sly seems to have replaced these aspects with standing in a tough pose looking intense and shouting were applicable. Needless to say I did not see the dark and gritty anti hero I was hoping for.I realise that this is a tall order for any actor and Sly in not helped by the films biggest problem the atrocious dialogue. Clichs and over dramatic speeches destroy any hope of realism.My final comment... Judge Dredd's helmet.This should stay on at all times. I know this seems superficial but it is representative of certain aspects of Judge Dredd's personality. Firstly Dredd's lack of personal ego secondly his almost robot like dedication determination and 'perceived' invulnerability and thirdly Dredd's function as an executioner.There I feel a little better now I've got that off my chest.

I knew that with him in the picture it would be in wide release and I knew that much like Batman Judge Dredd does not need a great actor to play him.  Stallone seemed to fit the bill of someone who could be tough have little dialogue and shoot up the enemies.  Little did I know that Judge Dredd would be put into the same category as Batman Forever and Batman and Robin in that they are all disneyland versions of a much darker comic.In the comic the future is a bleak place.  Comic books don't get much darker or bloodier than this one.  It is not a fun happy golucky comic. However it is extremely exciting and if translated correctly could be the perfect action movie.Showing a human side of Dredd was the worst mistake of this movie.  For one Dredd does not take his helmet off.  For two he does not have a sidekick.If this movie had been made correctly it would have received comparison's to the likes of Terminator 2 and Predator.  However after seeing this movie I think it would best be compared to the likes of Teen Wolf Too as one of the worst films ever made.".

To be true either BRONSON or COBURN had the 'DREDD' look but were getting on a bit in years. Finally after many legal wrangles the movie got made in 1995 and SYLVESTER STALLONE was picked to play the futuristic lawman. Once made the fans picked holes in the movie. DREDD takes his helmet off the fans could not forgive this but allow Hollywood a certain 'artistic licence'. Obviously STALLONE had to show his face if only in the scenes were he's incarcerated unlike the 2000AD 'JUDGE CALIGULA' stories whereas he was bandaged up due to a snipers wound Now nearly ten years on the movie is still fresh the effects still special and STALLONE still shines despite what people say STALLONE is the only 'toughguy' i'd want to see play DREDD right down to the comicbook 'snare' Every performance is great in this movie especially MAX VON SYDOW and director DANNY CANNON has come in for a lot of misguided flack. And it's also good to see that other minor 2000AD elements have been kept intact. The 'ANGEL FAMILY' are exactly as i remember them in the comics and the set design is MEGACITYONE come to life. So for those who are to geeky to accept a little change just imagine that JUDGE DREDD had been made in 2004. DREDD would be played by either VIN DIESEL or THE ROCK..........Holly drok!!!!!Big lee gives this fine movie a solid ten and would readily welcome a sequel but it must be either the JUDGE CALIGULA or JUDGE DEATH plotline".

	schema:reviewBody "Given that all Hollywood adaptations of comic book heroes end up fundamentally flawed this one does a pretty good job. Ok so Dredd takes his helmet off the abstention from this was merely a 2000AD injoke anyway Griffin is a bad guy the entire Council of distinguished judges is wiped out in an instant Rico is not the identical twin clone of Dredd Aspen is substituted for Titan neither Fargo nor Rico have badges bearing their proper name Dredd... but all these faults pale in comparison to what the movie actually got right.The casting was absolutely spoton Dredd Hershey Fargo McGruder Griffin... all these actors looked and behaved exactly as their 2000AD counterparts. Fergie wasn't the same as his comicbook counterpart but so what? The original character was such a caricature of a real person had he been portrayed in that way he no doubt would have ended up the JarJar Binks hatecharacter of the film. The costumes were also brilliantly realised from their comic book incarnations  something that is notoriously difficult to do especially for a helmet design as impractical as that of the MegaCity One judge!The dark totalitarian political landscape of MegaCity One was admirably conveyed particularly in the device used to convict Dredd the assassination of prodemocracy journalists and the underhand skullduggery of Griffin and his coconspirators. The icing on the cake was the inclusion of the brilliant Hammerstein robot from the ABC Warriors and that of the Angel Gang. A better screen portrayal of the Angel Gang simply could not have been wished for  Mean Machine was exactly as he is in the comic!My only real gripe with this movie is that the history of the 2000AD universe is significantly messed around with but as I have said this is expected of Hollywood and did not detract from this as a standalone film one bit. For me the most disappointing change made was that of making Judge Griffin the bad guy. In the comic he is one of the most exemplary judges and indeed much admired by Dredd himself as well as having an eyepatch for his troubles. It is a shame the film had to besmirch the good name of Griffin in this way  Jurgen Prochnow would have made a fine upstanding Griffin. That said the changes are nowhere near as bad as those made for Batman where the origins of both the Batman and the Joker are changed in such a way as to spoil the entire essense of the Batman mythos.Brit director Danny Cannon can congratulate himself on having done a fine job of preserving the essense of the world of Judge Dredd in the face of Hollywood revisionism!".

Ok so Dredd takes his helmet off the abstention from this was merely a 2000AD injoke anyway Griffin is a bad guy the entire Council of distinguished judges is wiped out in an instant Rico is not the identical twin clone of Dredd Aspen is substituted for Titan neither Fargo nor Rico have badges bearing their proper name Dredd... but all these faults pale in comparison to what the movie actually got right.The casting was absolutely spoton Dredd Hershey Fargo McGruder Griffin... all these actors looked and behaved exactly as their 2000AD counterparts. Fergie wasn't the same as his comicbook counterpart but so what? The original character was such a caricature of a real person had he been portrayed in that way he no doubt would have ended up the JarJar Binks hatecharacter of the film.

If you were guilty the emotionless Dredd would issue whatever punishment he saw fit.Back to the movie anyway. It's not always easy to translate a comic book hero to the big screen without changing things but they did a great job with this movie. If you were to look at a photo of Stallone in this movie and compare it to a drawing of the comic book Dredd you would see no difference. Stallone was Dredd down to a tee.The story is great as well. Dredd is accused of a crime he did not commit and he must prove his innocence. The action scenes in the movie were fantastic.All in all a brilliant film. I just wish there'd have been a sequel.".

I thought it was a fantastic film with a really cool story great action cool actors decent acting and some great bits of comedy.Sylvester Stallone was the PERFECT choice for the role of Judge Dredd!  He completely fits the mold and does an outstanding job portraying Judge Dredd. Rob Schnieder was an excellent choice for the part of Herman Ferguson as well.  Rob added a great deal of comedy to the film and it was all good comedy nothing terribly cheesy or annoying just perfect.  Diane Lane looks nothing short of fabulous throughout the film and pulls off a fine performance as well.  Max von Sydow is not someone I would expect to be in a film like this but nonetheless I'm glad he did because he did a fantastic job.  Armand Assante was excellent in the antagonist position.  He makes and excellent bad guy I'd love to see him in more films.  The rest of the cast was good as well.The special effects in the film are very good for the most part there's nothing much to complain about.  The thing that completely made this film for me is the ABC Warbot.  What a beautiful design!  Truly fantastic!!!  The only thing I would have liked to see is a long shot of the Warbot walking but I'm sure with the budget of the film that was virtually impossible so I'll deal with it.  But all the scenes with the Warbot are just fantastic!I don't really see why people tend to dislike this film.  I thought it was an all around fun movie with plenty of good things going for it.  I would definitely recommend this film to anyone that like superhero movies or just futuristic action films.  I hope that you like this film as much as I do.  Thanks for reading.LebowskiT1000".

	schema:reviewBody "To be certain a film adapted from a comic book prior to Spiderman was often met with trepadition and curious sideways glances a reaction similar to passing a midget on the street.  While we can now all have hopes for a future with faithful and enjoyable adaptions of our favorite colored characters we must remember that while the future IS bright the past really sucks.  When trolling for worthwhile comic book titles only pay attention to Judge Dredd if you are looking for reasons to shed this mortal coil.The film opens with a moderately interesting intro showing page after page of JD comics.  Trust me the only inspiration that the filmakers drew from these comics has to have been from the cover art.  Put simply nothing in the movie actually reflects the comics.  Whereas the comics were dark and built for adults this film was a fairly weak 'R' rating relying on twelve year olds sneaking into theaters to make a profit.You see in the movie Judges are pansies who run from every thug with a gun instead of doing their job.  The Judges body armor is made up of a bulletproof helmet and shoulder pads.  One can only assume that they will be playing the Raiders soon.  Judges also get voice activated guns that can do wonderful things like fire flares which actually has no use in their giant city where light exists everywhere.  Judges also get the ugliest motorcycles in the history of automobiles.  Simply put their choppers look like amusement park bumper cars.

	onyx:emotionText "To be certain a film adapted from a comic book prior to Spiderman was often met with trepadition and curious sideways glances a reaction similar to passing a midget on the street.  While we can now all have hopes for a future with faithful and enjoyable adaptions of our favorite colored characters we must remember that while the future IS bright the past really sucks.  When trolling for worthwhile comic book titles only pay attention to Judge Dredd if you are looking for reasons to shed this mortal coil.The film opens with a moderately interesting intro showing page after page of JD comics.  Trust me the only inspiration that the filmakers drew from these comics has to have been from the cover art.  Put simply nothing in the movie actually reflects the comics.  Whereas the comics were dark and built for adults this film was a fairly weak 'R' rating relying on twelve year olds sneaking into theaters to make a profit.You see in the movie Judges are pansies who run from every thug with a gun instead of doing their job.  The Judges body armor is made up of a bulletproof helmet and shoulder pads.  One can only assume that they will be playing the Raiders soon.  Judges also get voice activated guns that can do wonderful things like fire flares which actually has no use in their giant city where light exists everywhere.  Judges also get the ugliest motorcycles in the history of automobiles.  Simply put their choppers look like amusement park bumper cars.  The fact that these bumper cars can fly seems to make wheels useless but I guess the budget excluded any more than one scene of horribly blue screened flying bikes.Something else that the budget seems to have excluded is any mention of original design.

Along with F.W. Murnau who became popular thanks to his thrilling NOSFERATU and innovative LAST LAUGH Pabst became a highly respected director thanks to the controversial THE JOYLESS STREET. He proved to be a director who could create something thought provoking and ambiguous who could surely enjoy appreciation among modern ambitious viewers. At that time however the movie's power occurred barely legal which resulted in chopping it up mutilating it and censoring it. Consequently THE JOYLESS STREET became the most censored film of the Weimar Republic.Years have passed emerging in various versions in multiple countries for instance the widely known Kino print missed four reels.

One of the thoughts accompanied their successful attempts 'a thought provoking movie' by a great master that Pabst was will also find its audience nowadays.In the times of computers and action movies someone may ask 'What is it that makes THE JOYLESS STREET worth being called 'thought provoking'? Now Pabst's movie is on the one hand a historical glimpse of social classes in the post War I Vienna homeless Lumpenproletariat working class destitute middle class and nouveau riche upper middle class on the other hand a unique insight into the psyches of individuals within the social misery. Rather than a tear jerking drama this is the perfect exploration of despair difficult decisions determination contrasted with the manipulative upper classes who spread false rumors that destroy the poor but rouse the wealthy. This is in other words the depiction of the joyous life in wealth and speculations clashing with the joyless life in poverty and distress...that is what emerges from THE JOYLESS STREET consider the source novel by Hugo Bettauer murdered in 1925. Indeed it is something that builds an unforgettable experience that does not allow anyone remain indifferent. However in spite of its universal nature and a very provocative content the movie was almost on the verge of negligence and still remains highly mutilated condensed subjective. Why is it so bound to be distorted? In most cases the reason appears to be the aforementioned censorship. Paradoxically however this subjectivity appears to be caused by one name a great star who makes its title remembered.That is Greta Garbo without doubt one of the greatest charisma of cinema. The title in her filmography is bound to be treated solely as a Garbo film. Yet THE JOYLESS STREET is not at all a sort of film like many of her MGM vehicles. This is along with GOSTA BERLING SAGA directed by her Swedish mentor Mauritz Stiller a beautiful exemplification of Garbo's exceptional talent still uninfluenced by Hollywood. It is here we encounter the young Greta Garbo 19 years old at the time who is not in the lead not a great queen of MGM who is not a vamp a seductress nor a symbol but a poor young girl one of many in a queue for meat within the sorrows of the joyless street. Thanks to many of her scenes we find out that Garbo acquired this unique 'magic' of hers already in Europe at the side of great directors and great European cast THE JOYLES STREET also casts Asta Nielsen Werner Kraus and Hertha Von Walter. Much is born here much that we find elsewhere her overwhelming gestures her unique contact with the camera her face that alone speaks to us more clearly than intertitles beside the strange makeup that one can surely get used to in the long run. Although her role of Greta in THE JOYLESS STREET is a secondary role she seems to take over our attention. But here let me highlight some aspects of Garbo's role and performance in a more detailed manner.Garbo's job is very difficult yet she crafts it with extraordinary flair and profound insight into determination and dignity. It is clear that she truly identifies with the character she plays. There are some moments particularly near the end where her face expresses a chain of different feelings from angst despair fear to relief and joy. The role is something that addresses her personality more than seductive vamps or women in love with diamonds. Perhaps that is why she does not need much experience yet portrays the character so genuinely and memorably. But unfortunately many do not understand that interesting fact. Nevertheless Garbo's impact on the film's success is so strong that there is no doubt THE JOYLESS STREET has been solely considered a Garbo movie since 1925. That September 1925 Garbo arrived in the USA with her mentor director Mauritz Stiller and became the supreme artist. Yet...nowadays when we view THE JOYLESS STREET we should keep in mind that it is much more than Garbo's masterful acting. It is an exception in the history of cinema due to its highly psychological content border of expressionist  realist atmosphere its 'political incorrectness' and innovations galore yet also its strange fate of various versions different attempts of preservation and the widespread subjectivity. Although it was on the verge of negligence there are fortunately people who appreciate the great potential of this film. It is a pity that so few movie buffs have seen this film but perhaps the movie's difficult fate proves its greatness.

	schema:headline " The Sorrows of Joyless Street";
	schema:reviewBody "The Sorrows of The Joyless StreetDirector Georg Wilhelm Pabst's The Joyless Street is one of the most censored and mutilated films in history. The film premier on May 18 1925 in Berlin. The film was a sensation and launched the new reality movement in German filmmaking. The film was based on Hugo Bettauer's 1924 serialized novel. The film version would propel Greta Garbo to international fame.Bettauer would never see the premier of the film based on his novel. On March 26 1925 Beattauer was dead. Otto Rothstock a national socialist thug had shot him to death. Bettauer had ironically written a highly controversial dystopian satirical novel called A City Without Jews A Novel About The Day After Tomorrow. The novel was about the expulsion of the Jews from Austria. Had he lived Bettauer would have seen his fictitious world become a prophetic reality in 1938.The original version of The Joyless Street was a dark study of life in hyperinflation Vienna in the wake of the Great War. It was about poverty and despair in a defeated country. In the original film as in the book Pabst set out to tell the story how inflation destroyed the sundry spectra of society and led to people to live lives of impoverishment desperation and despair. Pabst would tell his story through the lives of two main characters Marie and Greta. Nielson would play Marie a poverty stricken character with a brutal and cruel father who would prostitute herself for the man she loves but who despises her. Garbo would play Greta the daughter of a foolish and sickly middle class bureaucrat would would resist the temptation of easy money and prostitution.The film shocked European governments.

	onyx:emotionText "The Sorrows of The Joyless StreetDirector Georg Wilhelm Pabst's The Joyless Street is one of the most censored and mutilated films in history. The film premier on May 18 1925 in Berlin. The film was a sensation and launched the new reality movement in German filmmaking. The film was based on Hugo Bettauer's 1924 serialized novel. The film version would propel Greta Garbo to international fame.Bettauer would never see the premier of the film based on his novel. On March 26 1925 Beattauer was dead. Otto Rothstock a national socialist thug had shot him to death. Bettauer had ironically written a highly controversial dystopian satirical novel called A City Without Jews A Novel About The Day After Tomorrow. The novel was about the expulsion of the Jews from Austria. Had he lived Bettauer would have seen his fictitious world become a prophetic reality in 1938.The original version of The Joyless Street was a dark study of life in hyperinflation Vienna in the wake of the Great War. It was about poverty and despair in a defeated country. In the original film as in the book Pabst set out to tell the story how inflation destroyed the sundry spectra of society and led to people to live lives of impoverishment desperation and despair. Pabst would tell his story through the lives of two main characters Marie and Greta. Nielson would play Marie a poverty stricken character with a brutal and cruel father who would prostitute herself for the man she loves but who despises her. Garbo would play Greta the daughter of a foolish and sickly middle class bureaucrat would would resist the temptation of easy money and prostitution.The film shocked European governments. England banned the film from public viewing. Italy France Austria and elsewhere would show the film only after it had been considerably mutilated.Americans thought that the only value of the film was the presence of Greta Garbo. Curiously Garbo was paid in American dollars rather than worthless German ones.As a result most of the available versions of this film were cut to make the international sensation Great Garbo the star the film over the top billed Asta Nielson who played a woman driven to murder.

	schema:reviewBody "I won't pretend to be anywhere as knowledgeable about the subject of Joyless Street as some of the other informed reviewers on this board. Interestingly I find the most intellectual and thought provoking discussion of films on the IMDb to take place regarding pictures one has probably never heard of. The strange thing about this picture is that it was part of a twenty movie offering from Mill Creek Entertainment compiled under the heading of 'Cult Classics' most of which were exploitation flicks from the Thirties and Forties. Obviously the film I viewed was a somewhat restored version heralding the arrival of Greta Garbo in her film debut with some general comments on the setting for the story. Others have critiqued various iterations of the picture that have cropped up since the original in 1925 mine was a seriously edited sixty one minute version.There's no denying Greta Garbo's charisma in her first screen performance her body language and facial expressiveness might have given rise to a song entitled 'Greta Garbo Eyes' if someone had gotten around to it before the Bette Davis song. She also seemed to exude something of a Princess Di quality which intrigued me enough to draw the comparison. I doubt if that would have come through if this hadn't been a silent film.The story itself presents a woeful dichotomy in the life of a ravaged Vienna following the first World War with poverty and starvation along side the excess and overindulgence of privileged classes residing in the same city. Perhaps the result of a largely shortened cut up version of the original picture I never got the impression that Garbo's character also named Greta would turn to prostitution to provide for her family even though one could surmise the cabaret environment would encourage that. As others have mentioned the sanitized happy ending seemed somewhat off kilter while the contrived musical accompaniment was just a bit too upbeat for the subject matter. Still an effective picture and harrowing look at post war conditions nearly a century gone by.".

Greta Garbo plays in what is labeled as her first starring role in the version I watched and does an admiral job as the daughter of a retired civil servant who's always trying to do the right thing to help her family's financial situation but it never seems to work out. Her performance is all about her facial and body gestures which of course is a must for a silent film and she is excellent with this. The hero in the film is an American dogooder who helps the family survive by moving into their home and paying rent but the authorities would prefer that he mingle with the uppity crowd and soon removes him from the setting.

Compared to a modern film this early Greta Garbo film is way too rushedbeing completed in only 61 minutes when it would have been drawn out to at least 90 minutes or more today to tell the same story. However one thing isn't so different between this film and today'sthe acting and movie itself is amazingly subtle and restrained for the 20s. Most dramas from that era frankly try too hard and lack subtletybut not this one. Even seen today it's still a pretty good film. And compared to the rather gaunt and extremely manicured and coiffed Garbo of the late 20s and 30s she is quite beautiful and realI really wish Hollywood had kept her that way.The story itself reminds me of THE LAST LAUGH another German film made at about the same time. Both focus on the struggle of the common people in the Germanspeaking world following WWIas there is great poverty and disparity between the HAVES and HAVE NOTS. Both films are meant as social criticism and agents of change. And both are amazingly welldone though a better film THE LAST LAUGH does have a rather poor ending so my advice is see both.".

It was a shock to realize she was supposed to be his daughter! I also thought that the millionaire must have a taste for ugly women but it seems I was wrong here too. She is actually supposed to be young and attractive  in a flashy sort of way. Miss Nielsen despite some really exotic costumes is neither of these things. Fortunately the rest of the players are more aptly cast particularly Greta Garbo whose extremely expressive face and natural acting ability quickly and understandably made her a big star in silent films. Here she is a more svelte Garbo than we are used to. Her attractive figure is apparent even in her deliberately downbeat costumes. This movie was obviously based on a novel. There are lots and lots of dialogue subtitles but Pabst has met the challenge to put the film across with a fair amount of pace. Aside from Garbo the player who makes the most impression is Tamara Geva who plays Lia Lied  although she really has only the one scene. In all Joyless Street is a particularly wellacted movie a joy to watch even in 2016!".

And the names Asta Nielsen Greta Garbo and Werner Krauss should make everybody curious who has an interest in this era of filmmaking and genre. There is a lot of crime happening in this film and it was an era of depression in general if you look how this came out 8 years after the end of World War I and also 8 years before the Nazis' claim to power. Certainly not the most delightful years. The tone and atmosphere of the film are in accordance. As a whole it may have had to do mostly with my general dislike of silent blackandwhite films that I did not end up enjoying this movie. The version i watched ran for slightly under 2 hours but I see that there are so many different version out there the shortest being edited down to under an hour and the longest running for approximately 3 hours. I guess I am glad that I did not watch the latter as this movie especially the forgettable plot and story already dragged a whole lot at 118 minutes. I only recommend this film to the most diehard Pabst and German silent film fans but these have already seen it anyway I guess. Everybody else may want to skip it.".

With a graceful slightofhand it ends up being something very good.As with any runofthemill period piece there's a lavish attention to the set designs and costumes here representing late nineteenth century Vienna. Director Burger puts a nice spin on the sameold sameold with an acute attention to lighting especially in the dreamily overexposed flashbacks and old fashioned camera techniques witness the circular camera's eye closing to transition from scenes to give the film the feel of being a fond memory of a classic movie from a bygone era.The central romance where Edward Norton's title character and Jessica Biel's Dutchess are starcrossed lovers kept apart because of class and society had all the makings of a snoreinducing cheeseathon. Executed in an understated manner that services the greater plot it ends up being anything but. Norton's performance especially in the second half of the film when he turns into a man of very few words had the potential to be onenote. As an actor he speaks volumes with his eyes. Biel a former teen idol and TV star seemed a horrific choice for this role. She pulls of the nifty trick of being quite good. Even better are Rufus Sewell as the tyrannical crownprince and Paul Giamatti as the chief inspector. Using a short story as the source material characterizations had the potential to be paperthin but these seasoned veterans make the most of their lines and scenes adding terror humor and gravitas through their vocal and physical deliveries where lesser actors would've been wooden and cold. The entire cast also worked together very well utilizing their odd vaguely European and aristorcatic accent. Everyone used it so consistently and earnestly it didn't seem to matter after awhile that the accent was unnecessary.A more overeager or pretentious director may have completely sabotaged the fantastic ending to The Illusionist and cheated the audience. Handled deftly by Burger the grande finale where all is revealed is a wholly organic and satisfying conclusion that rewards the patient viewer and fulfills the lofty promises of the themes presented throughout the work.The Illusionist boasts an excellent music score from minimalist composer Phillip Glass that easily rivals his great work done in Candyman and The Hours. Norton and Giamatti treat us to some of the best staring since the days of silent films. The look on Giamatti's face and the positioning of his raised eyebrows as he watches Norton perform his illusions coupled with Norton's eyes as he pulls off his tricks are priceless.".

Jennifer Biel is tragic and compelling as a woman trapped by society and dubious duty. Paul Giamatti  who seems to be in every other movie these days  is wonderful as a conflicted man unsure of whom he serves. Rufus Sewell as the Crown Prince Leopold is that man and he embodies the boohiss villain. Vain and driven he is larger than life and not one to cross as the illusionist comes to find out. The music of Philip Glass fits the scenes and add just the right amount of tension. Plus the horses are very old world with large hooves and a heck of a lot of presence. A compelling and beautiful film.".

Paul Giamatti  who seems to be in every other movie these days  is wonderful as a conflicted man unsure of whom he serves. Rufus Sewell as the Crown Prince Leopold is that man and he embodies the boohiss villain. Vain and driven he is larger than life and not one to cross as the illusionist comes to find out. The music of Philip Glass fits the scenes and add just the right amount of tension. Plus the horses are very old world with large hooves and a heck of a lot of presence. A compelling and beautiful film.";

The story weaved fluidly through these locations and seemed to make the locales a vital part of the story. Ed Norton was mesmerizing a superb performance that allowed the story to unfold seemingly at his discretion. Jess Biel was very believable and stunningly beautiful. Paul Giamatti sp played an admirable role and took the viewer by surprise in many elements of the story. The story was fresh and imaginative very intriguing. Not as predictable as you would think. We saw this at a Sundance screening and the entire theater of 500 seats was full and when the movie was over all you could hear was excited and happy chatter lots of applause as well. Director came out for a QA after and was very amiable in answering questions. Highly recommended!!!".

My only complaint would be that the movie needs a little editing towards the end as the creators seem to show basically the same scene over and over in an attempt to drive home Norton's character's emotional distress. Unfortunately this gets a little monotonous for viewers.

This is a very liberal adaptation of a Steven Millhauser story about a magician in Victorian era in Vienna. Shot entirely in the Czech Republic at gorgeously befitting locations this is a beautifully made period piece complete with genuine turnofthecentury illusions a wonderful soundtrack lovely cinematography and an intriguing story.Edward Norton plays Eisenheim the magician who lost his first love as a young boy because they were separated by classes but years later when he is touring Vienna rediscovers her in the form of Princess Sophie Jessica Beil. Unfortunately Sophie is engaged to be married to the unseemly Prince Leopold Rufus Sewell who immediately takes a dislike to Eisenheim chiefly because he fails to debunk his illusions. Prince Leopold not one to do his own dirty work relies upon Chief Inspector Uhl Paul Giamatti to handle Eisenheim.Edward Norton is great as Eisenheim. That shouldn't be surprising as he's turned in some truly remarkable performances in the pastFight Club American History XXX Rounders and The Score. And of course Paul Giamatti is excellent as well although his role is something of a departure for him. But perhaps most surprising is Biel who is not only radiantly beautiful in this movie but shows surprising talent as well and holds her screen presence toe to toe with Norton.Burger has managed to pull off really a remarkable film. The plot moves along steadily. There is also a very consistent tonalitya foreboding dreariness that perfectly matches the subject matter and the period. In the same way that David Lynch did with The Elephant Man. The illusions are captivating and almost believable. The love story is touching. And Eisenheim is a compelling and sympathetic hero blessed with such unconventionally heroic talents that the entire movie feels fresh and alive.".

Edward Norton's character plays an inscrutable but romantic master illusionist.

Paul Giamatti bothered me just a tad at first because he spoke in a nearwhisper and had a scruffy beard so you couldn't read his lips. He got louder and his character developed pretty darned well thank goodness. Actually he was fantastic so what else is new?. The makers of this movie did the same thing the makers of Little Miss Sunshine didmade me want to see the film twice but for different reasons LMS because the first time I saw it I laughed so hard I cried and I really needed a laugh again and got it The Illusionist because I was like the audience for the title character's shows the first time I saw itjust kind of naive and awed and staring up at the action with my mouth hanging open. So I'll have to see it again and pay attention. Kind of like when my daughter told me to go see The Sixth Sense again and pay attention to what Bruce Willis's character was wearing. Plotwise this is unrelated folksjust a movie watcher's analogy.At first the oldfashioned circle wipes seemed a little distracting but in retrospect they were part of the excellent moviemaking decisions that created the illusion of time and place in this film. A really good story with really good art direction and really good actors costumes and settings. Definitely worth a goseeor two!".

The makers of this movie did the same thing the makers of Little Miss Sunshine didmade me want to see the film twice but for different reasons LMS because the first time I saw it I laughed so hard I cried and I really needed a laugh again and got it The Illusionist because I was like the audience for the title character's shows the first time I saw itjust kind of naive and awed and staring up at the action with my mouth hanging open. So I'll have to see it again and pay attention. Kind of like when my daughter told me to go see The Sixth Sense again and pay attention to what Bruce Willis's character was wearing. Plotwise this is unrelated folksjust a movie watcher's analogy.At first the oldfashioned circle wipes seemed a little distracting but in retrospect they were part of the excellent moviemaking decisions that created the illusion of time and place in this film. A really good story with really good art direction and really good actors costumes and settings. Definitely worth a goseeor two!";

'The Illusionist' is a fairly decent example of a script that sets up a certain number of expectations and then toys with the outcomes before knocking them all down like dominoes.There are three main reasons to watch 'The Illusionist.' The first reason is that the script isn't too bad. I was with a group of friends. Two of us guessed correctly how the film was going to develop. The other five were quite surprised by the film's ending. None of us were disappointed and the film got an ovation from the audience when it was over. I would describe 'The Illusionist' as a mystery or a puzzle. If you like films that make the grey matter between your ears do a little work you might just find yourself pleasantly surprised  that said there isn't anything so taxing here as to make the film overly complex or convoluted.The second reason to watch this film is the involvement of Ricky Jay. He's in the credits for consultation and as one of the best magicians working today in Hollywood it is worth your time to take a look at the film to see some of his influence. I'll be interested when this comes out on DVD to find out the degree of involvement. If the producers were smart they probably listened a lot to a man who is in the Guiness book of World Records for his use of playing cards as weapons! My third reason to recommend 'The Illusionist' is some excellent work from the three main male leads Paul Giamatti Ed Norton and Rufus Sewell. As a qualifier let me add that Jessica Biel does a pretty good job too  I just found that the energy and zeal with which her male counterparts performed ate up the screen and left her adrift. There's a little joke in there you might find funny after you've watched the film. Ed Norton is very controlled and restrained here Rufus Sewell seems to relish every scene he's in with villainous delight and Paul Giamatti shines as the police inspector with a taste for amateur magic. Giamatti has a gift for facial expressions and as a friend of mine hilariously put it in his final scene his facial expression is 'six degrees of crazy.' I love that! These are three compelling performances and although you might see your way through the contrivances of the script the good performances should be more than enough to keep you entertained.'The Illusionist' isn't bad. A good little mystery with some nice acting all around.".

To compare it with 2006's The Prestige a film about the same subject the Prestige simply crushes the Illusionist when it comes to movie magic relying very little on CGI and reaching our hearts through an amazing script about humanity...the strive for success the need to be loved and at the same time showing us how magic really exists in our modern world. The Illusionist on the other hand is simply more superficial in nature and would work better as like a thirtyminute TV show. The big twist at the end would be very satisfying for avid TV watchers just after a commercial break but seriously when your making a movie around it you shouldn't just have the viewer sit and wait with little to no hints just to fill up time and then hit them with it and expect a big hooray.

Not to sell the film short the story includes a career police officer who's pushed and pulled by a cruel crown prince who promises to make him mayor of Vienna in exchange for his complicity. Their relationship is the film's most interestingly done facet especially as the police officer noses around into a murder that brings him closer to Mr. Crown Prince. The film's best scene is when the Crown Prince is hunting on his estate and fires off his shotgun bringing to an abrupt end the talk he was having with the police officer. In the end it's a meticulous recreation of a time which isn't nearly matched by a meticulous presentation of a story.".

He's a poor lout with a passion for card tricks. She's a duchess or something.He runs off and becomes a guy who entertains people with feats of illusion so eyepopping he'd have to be more than mere mortal to perform them.His popularity grows and the emperor's son Prince Leopold comes to see the show and brings his girlfriend who turns out to be you guessed it Eisenheim's longlost childhood sweetypie Sophie. Sophie played forgettably by Jessica Biel is pretty earnest and has a set of really nice lips. You know the kind of chick dudes in the movies line up to risk their whole lives for.Apparently having aged at two thirds the rate of Eisenheim Sophie comes up on stage to help out in a trick only Jesus Christ himself could have pulled off. They recognize each other and later decide to try and be together.But the prince played handily by Rufus Sewell is none too pleased. Not only has he got his heart set on keeping Sophie around but she plays an integral role in his plot to overthrow his dad and assume the throne. What's more the prince is threatened by Eisenheim's amazing tricks and wants to upstage him.Nice setup. Too bad the rest of the story relies on fairytale logic to proceed but realworld logic to endear itself. I don't know much about magic granted. But I do know that at the dawn of the 20th century just as today there is no way to conjure the ghostly form of a chubby little boy out of nowhere have it toddle up to a stage in various levels of opacity PASSING THROUGH someone's outreached hand in the process  revealing it to have the consistency of a slightly gelatinous cloud like all ghosts in the movies these days  and then have it stand triumphant on the stage.David Copperfield eat your heart out.And hey whatever. Fairytales are often far more compellingly real than those that abide the laws of physics. Just make up your mind for cripes sake! If the ending relies on good oldfashioned science and cleverness PUT us in a universe in which these things hold sway.Don't try and have it both ways.But this sloppy universe isn't what dooms the film.Like its effects its plot is laughably implausible when it's not mindnumbingly predictable.And its characters evince the emotional range of perhaps Punch andor Judy. Eisenheim is morally perfect and professionally superhuman. Sophie is the standard damselindistress. And the prince is a mustachetwirling caricature of a badguy. All he doesn't do is tie Sophie to the traintracks. MAJOR SPOILER next paragraph only And sure young lovers should be together but a real careful look at the plotpoints reveals two people who fool some cat into thinking he's murdered his girlfriend get the cops to believe it and then stand silently by when said cat decides to blow his brains out over it. And sure the cat is a powerdrunk miscreant who MIGHT have killed his girlfriend if she hadn't micked him first and would PROBABLY have overthrown the emperor. But he's a squarejawed alphamale bossy dude and is presumed guilty by virtue of his appearance in a modern American film. The ending was twisty but a real twist would have been for the prince to reveal himself as something deeper than the tinhorn dictator he is portrayed as throughout. Maybe he woos her back from the itinerant entertainer. Now THAT would have been original.In the end you've got a pretty standard love triangleDavid vs. Goliath story wrapped in a slightly new brand of snazzy effects and really thick atmosphere.Take your 13yearold daughter to see this one but man bring your iPod.This movie review by Erik Gloor".

	schema:reviewBody "The Illusionist is actually more than anything an actor's movie which is a little ironic considering how much romantic sweep and movement there should be in the writing and directing. In terms of Neil Burger's direction it's never really bad at all and is very competent most of the time aside from a couple of notable instances involving the 'soft focus' around the edges of the frame in flashbacks and one sex scene. The writing however is a little more lacking even if it's also never annoying or deterring from what's watchable in the film. But there's contrivances as well through all that is supposed to be seen as complex and very intricate and exquisite. The latter of those can be tapped into in the period setting of early 20th century Vienna and it's always professionally done. But there's something lacking to it as well a real driving force through the romantic core of the story and that supporting characters are more interesting than the main characters almost in spite of the performances.And as mentioned if there's any reason more than anything to see it it's for the acting where Edward Norton makes a character who's own purpose and need in the film is very narrow to make his illusions but more than anything all for the possession and togetherness of another woman played by Jessica Biel. As a child he Eisenheim and Sophie meet and fall in love but are separated by the boundaries of class. Years pass and she comes back into his life by chance but now she has a suitor a Prince played by the icy Rufus Sewell. When a certain tragedy befalls the situation of the Prince and his bridetobe this sets Eisenheim off into a whole new direction with his illusions Norton often in a trembling shocked trance look that is always convincing by conjuring up lost souls. This the sets off Paul Giamatti's inspector character and the ties become all the greater to what may become of the central question however elusive it might seem.All of this might be even more compelling if the actual romantic plot felt stronger. But despite the impeccable skills of Norton who makes this bland character driven and intuitive his choices as an actor are very good here if not great and the OK presence of Biel their characters aren't as interesting as the tricks and leapoffaith sized wonders that Eisenheim creates on the stage. If anything at times the film felt stronger and with a better purpose and strength with Giamatti on screen as he is more than anything the part of the audience trying to figure things out. By the end his own revelation is probably the biggest leap of all almost Shyamalansized yet I find his performance is what sticks with me as opposed to the twists and surprises thrown to the audience. It's almost as if the ironclad conventions of the plot and the intensity passion and creativity of what goes on in Eisenheim's total control battle it out for dominance. I'd recommend the Illusionist but with some reservations that not the spectacular event that it might seem to be. Its got skill and tact and a very fine sensibility with Norton and Giamatti and even the dastardly done Prince by Sewell. Though at the same time it's really got nothing up its sleeve. Grade B".

God this movie is a joke! I can't believe how many things are wrong with it. This movie about a magician has fallen into every trap The Prestige avoided. Whereas in Nolan's film all magic tricks are possible at least according to the movie's logic The Illusionist makes the magician look like a real wizard. Apparently director Neil Burger wanted to leave it to the viewer to decide whether Norton's character Eisenheim relies on tricks or really has magical powers. That is the first thing that is very lame about The Illusionist.What's worse is the story. Slow uninteresting not believable and ultimately completely unsatisfying. In other words the script is a complete failure.The most shocking thing however is the acting. I would never have thought that Edward Norton could be so bad. He stumbles through this movie like an amateur playing his first main role in a high school stage play. Nothing much could be expected from Jessica Biel and she's just about not horrible. Paul Giamatti tried his best to act convincingly but overacted in the end. His constant rolling eyes and his weird doubtful yet intrigued but always critical looks come very close to unintentional comedy. The best performance in this movie was given by Rufus Sewell but even he couldn't save a character as one dimensional and shallow as Crown Prince Leopold.One positive thing about the movie is the set design. As a person who is living in Vienna I would have loved if they had shot this right here in my hometown but hey what the hell. A movie as promising as this one with a cast like this is exciting enough even if it just pretends to be set in Vienna or so I thought. Well after having seen The Illusionst I'm not very excited anymore. This was just a great opportunity wasted. I wouldn't watch it a second time.".

For all that this film promises I got way more of a surprise seeing the rating it has on this site than anything I saw in the film itself.The respectable cast do what they can with their bland boring characters and the setting is beautiful but that wasn't nearly enough to keep me interested. An hour or so into the film I knew how it was going to turn out and I didn't really care. By the end I was downright annoyed. I didn't build up enough compassion for the 'hero' and 'heroine' and I didn't dislike the villain enough to justify where the film sees them end up. Don't get me wrong the villain was evil enough but the reasons we're given to hate him seemed to be thought up and thrown in with clichd subtext and a few clichd scenes at the last minute and some of the decisions he makes later in the film are inconsistent with earlier parts. Maybe I'm a sucker for the bad guy but I just ended up feeling sorry for him and I guess it's because of that I didn't end up liking the good guys. There's no character development here. Biel's character is insipid shallow and annoying and Norton does his job well but seems bored most of the way through. Giamatti is as good as ever but his character is at times annoyingly inconsistent too. Sewell didn't have much to work with. If you want to see him as a much better villain in a much better film see A Knight's Tale.I was expecting this film to grab me a lot more than it did but it turned out to be more of a disappointment than anything else.".

	schema:reviewBody "Still the most Dickensian of all the Oliver Twist films David Lean's inspired version never the less is much indebted in its style to the German Expressionist Cinema. It's London is more related to Fritz Lang than Victorian England but the spirit of Dickens is alive and well in the accurately drawn caricatures from the novel. Outstanding performances by Francis J. Sullivan as ridiculous Mr. Bumble Alec Guiness's chillingly evil Fagin despite a badly judged nose job and the eye boggling twitching Robert Newton as the ferocious Bill Sykes. Even his dog trembles at his temper in fact the dog is a major actor in this version.John Newton Howard is a rather angelic Oliver with a more refined delivery than one would have expected from a workhouse background. But it all goes decidedly well thanks to Lean's superb direction stunning images clever editing and a sterling cast. Viewed today so many years after it was filmed it remains the most vivid and Gothic recreation of the story. Probably Charles Dickens would approve. The heroic length recent version by Roman Polanski is generally faithful to the novel but lacks the pizazz and humour that is in Dicken's writing. David Lean made only two excursions into Dickens Oliver Twist and Great Expectations both milestones in cinema. One can but wonder how well he may have brought Bleak House or Our Mutual Friend to the screen.".

	schema:headline " The Best Film Version of Dickens' Second Novel";
	schema:reviewBody "In 1835 London began reading a series of comic essays or sketches by an unknown writer  it turned out a Parliamentary reporter. He wrote these pieces in a book illustrated by Hablot Browne who drew pictures under the nickname Phiz. The writer of the pieces decided to supply them to the public as SKETCHES BY BOZ to complement his illustrator. The writer was actually named Charles John Huffan Dickens. He was only 23 years old and he found himself a minor celebrity. Mr. Dickens followed this with a full novel originally planned like the SKETCHES but centered on a group of wealthy Englishmen touring the whole of the British Isles. Eventually this picaresque novel centered on the leader of the group Mr. Samuel Pickwick and his valet Sam Weller. THE POSTHUMOUS PAPERS OF THE PICKWICK CLUB later renamed THE PICKWICK PAPERS was a tremendous success especially as in the second half of the story Dickens got serious about the legal issue of breach of promise broken engagement lawsuits the corruption of British lawyers and the horrors of debtor's prison. He began to see a formula develop here. He was more than a one book phenomenon and he could see that while people adored his sense of humor they also liked the serious material. His own life had been harsh  his father had been in debtor's prison and Dickens had to work in a blacking warehouse a warehouse where bottles were filled and labeled as a youth. So he put a great deal in his work of the underside of life in modern England. Compare his novels with those of the two popular Gods of the day Sir Walter Scott's novels were about a heroic past while Jane Austen concentrated on personalities in the countryside upper middle class who were concerned about getting married. Dickens was quite different.But for his third novel he reversed his formula  instead of a basically comic story enlightened with dramatic moments he made it a tragic dramatic tale enlightened with comic highlights. It was this formula he would stick to quite successfully from 1837 to 1870 for the bulk of his novels and short stories.In 1836 there had been a trial of a receiver of stolen goods named Ikey Solomon. Ikey was Jewish. He was also something of a thief trainer. Found guilty Ikey was sent to Australia for the rest of his life. Dickens decided that he would incorporate this story into his novel.The hero a poor boy who was brought up in an orphanage is mistreated by those in authority including a pompous beadle named Mr. Bumble and eventually runs away but falls into a gang in London led by one Fagin. Fagin is a Jewish thief and receiver in stolen goods. He is also a trainer of pickpockets and thieves led by one called The Artful Dodger. He also works closely with a violent professional burglar named Bill Sykes who has only two close relationships his girl a woman named Nancy and his pet bulldog. Oliver in the course of the story is separated from the gang when he is arrested for picking the pocket of a gentleman named Mr. Brownlow. Brownlow tries to help Oliver  he can't place it but there seems something about the boy he likes. Sykes manages to recapture Oliver again but the latter is reunited by accident to Brownlow after he is injured in an burglary Sykes is committing. In the meantime Mr. Bumble and his wife the matron of the poor house Oliver was raised in have turned over information about Oliver's real history to a stranger named Monk. Monk has also been in contact with Fagin to make sure that Oliver is kept in the gang. But then Nancy starts showing a strong conscience about what is going on about the boy.I won't go beyond this in terms of the plot. David Lean had made several films including BRIEF ENCOUNTER before this 1948 film. He did a bang up job with a great cast John Howard Davies as Oliver Alec Guiness as Fagin Robert Newton as Sykes Henry Stephenson as Mr. Brownlow Kay Walsh as Nancy Francis L. Sullivan as Bumble and a young Anthony Newley as the Artful Dodger. Lean trimmed much out of the six hundred page novel short for a Dickens novel but left the main points. His biggest actions were concerning Alec Guiness's performance as Fagin  the character is a vicious antiSemitic caricature by Dickens who made fitful attempts to make up for it in later editions of the novel  showing Fagin was not a good Jew either! and the makeup job looked like something out of Julius Streicher's Nazi publication DER STURMER of a few years before. But the makeup job on Guiness was based on the illustrations of George Cruickshank and Phiz in their editions of TWIST when it came out. Still in balance to this Fagin is shown at the conclusion to have a sense of personal dignity when confronted by a deadly mob. That touch shows that Lean could go beyond Dickens' own prejudices to somewhat balance the story. The result was a masterpiece  certainly the best film adaptation of OLIVER TWIST possibly the best version on film of a Dickens novel.".

	schema:headline " The definitive film version of the story  atmospheric dark and well acted";
	schema:reviewBody "When his mother just about makes it to the workhouse before giving birth then dying Oliver Twist is born into the only world he has ever known  the workhouse and poverty. When he draws the short straw from among the children Oliver asks for more food at dinner and promptly finds himself up for sale for 5 to any honest trader willing to take him in. Oliver is taken to work for an undertaker until a fight over his mother makes him run away to London where the masters will never find him. Taken in by Fagin's group of child pickpockets Oliver starts to settle in until a brush with the law starts to bring his family history to the attention of those lacking scruples.Watching this film now or indeed at the time of its release in the UK it is hard to imagine that it would have sparked a riot in Berlin in its first showing in 1949 or that it was banned for two years in America on the grounds of being antiSemitic and was only released after significant cuts 10 minutes had been made. Of course the cynic in me would suggest that the US was making any excuse to limit British films in its cinema due to competition they don't need to do that any more! but I guess history is written by the winners and Hollywood is definitely winning that battle. Ironically enough the film was also banned in Israel and Egypt because of Fagin  with Israel claiming that Fagin was antiSemetic and Egypt claiming he was too sympathetic. Any roads regardless of the historical controversy this film is still considered by many to be the definitive version of Dickens' story and often is in top ten or so when polls for 'greatest British films' are carried out. The plot is dark and sombre as befits the source material painting a dark world of thieves poverty and workhouses within which the story of Oliver and his destiny are told. In essence it is a simple story but it is the atmosphere and characters that make it more interesting.This may have been as successful as some of Lean's other films due to the daft controversies around it but his is still a very effective job as director. The film feels Victorian and hopeless  just like the lives of those in the story and Lean creates a real atmosphere of despair and fear that is enjoyably dark and has moments that I was surprised to see in a film of the period. The cast do well with the characters and are a big part of its working. Ignoring all the hysteria over 'bad' characters being ethnic good to see things haven't changed that much Guinness is good as Fagin and doesn't allow himself to be just a ethnic stereotype  he is exploitative but he is also human and we get to see him as just being somebody else's 'boy' as well as Oliver. Newton is who I see when I think of Bill Sykes and Davies is a good Oliver even if his accent is way too posh for a workhouse baby and the film tends to lose him among all the more interesting and seedy characters we come across. Support is good from the likes of Walsh Sullivan Newley and others all combining to produce a colourful collection of dark characters in the seedy streets of London.Overall this is a good story even if it loses the Oliver story halfway through for a while in favour of the other characters. The direction is great and the whole film is dark and atmospheric. The acting is roundly good and supports the wealth of seedy characters on which the film is built.I'm not a massive fan of Dickens by and large but if I want to see a version of this story then this is the film I return to.".

Ignoring all the hysteria over 'bad' characters being ethnic good to see things haven't changed that much Guinness is good as Fagin and doesn't allow himself to be just a ethnic stereotype  he is exploitative but he is also human and we get to see him as just being somebody else's 'boy' as well as Oliver. Newton is who I see when I think of Bill Sykes and Davies is a good Oliver even if his accent is way too posh for a workhouse baby and the film tends to lose him among all the more interesting and seedy characters we come across. Support is good from the likes of Walsh Sullivan Newley and others all combining to produce a colourful collection of dark characters in the seedy streets of London.Overall this is a good story even if it loses the Oliver story halfway through for a while in favour of the other characters. The direction is great and the whole film is dark and atmospheric. The acting is roundly good and supports the wealth of seedy characters on which the film is built.I'm not a massive fan of Dickens by and large but if I want to see a version of this story then this is the film I return to.";

I have never seen so many incredible shots with wonderful contrasts of light and dark. Much of this is filmed dark rooms or nighttime in the cobblestone streets.

I'm a sucker for nice people especially an innocent child and to see suffer is not fun to me.One of those bad guys however is memorable Fagin played by Alec Guiness. In this film he has to be one of the ugliest people I've ever seen sporting the biggest nose ever put on screen. A teenage Anthony Newley as the artful Dodger also stands out.But as someone who is into art David Lean's direction and Guy Green's camerawork draw me back to this DVD every couple of years...and at least I always know there is a happy ending for the one nice kid in the film.".

He does just fine.Maybe it lacks the almost supernal fright quotient of Great Expectations opening scene in the graveyard but it still starts off with a fully pregnant woman dashing alone through a pounding torrent of rain and banging on the gates of a Poorhouse which is itself pretty gripping.And frankly I think the story is a little stronger in Oliver Twist than in Great Expectations although they share common themes. Oliver is an interesting kid and we follow him through various adventures mostly bad during his childhood starting in the workhouse and orphanage where he is raised. When he runs away he falls in with a scurrilous bunch of thieves among whom there is no honor. Fagin Guiness has organized a dozen or so street urchins into a gang of young ripoff artists and pickpockets. The growling and evil Bill Sikes Newton seems to be their fence. We also get a glimpse of a chubby pretty young Diana Dors who was to become something of a Brit sex bomb a few years later.The characters have memorable names that have entered the English vocabulary  Fagin Mr. Bumble the Beadle Mr. Sowerberry the Undertaker the Artful Dodger. And there are memorable lines. Oliver is chosen to protest that the orphanage doesn't give them enough gruel. Please sir I want some more. The best line though is given I think by Mr. Bumble. His villainy exposed the bursting Mr. Bumble shouts at the police that the whole business was his wife's idea. He's told that at the very least he is complicit and that the law always assumes that a man is responsible for the acts of his wife since the husband is the dominant partner. If THAT is the law sir then the law is a ASS! Amen.Dickens may have been a humanitarian but he was not a fool. The poor are not turned into saints and the better off are not all heavies. These are some mean streets down which Oliver must walk. Crooked too and cobblestoned. Picturesque kind of. Never has poverty been so starkly but appealingly photographed.The two Dickens movies came out at about the beginning of David Lean's career and looking back over his entire oeuvre it's hard to see what they have in common except a kind of micromanagement of details in the art direction and photography. Everything was required to be exactly right in order for him to be satisfied. As his films grew more expansive so did the landscapes. But the issues his movies deal with are all over the board social inequality balked romance war movies racism.He could be a terrible guy to work for impatient and insulting. When Alec Guiness stepped of the airplane for the location shooting on A Passage to India Lean greeted him sourly with I was hoping to get someone else for your part. Yet what a legacy Lean left behind. Oliver Twist is fully up to our expectations.".

	schema:reviewBody "Aside from the wonderful musical Oliver! this is probably the best version of Oliver Twist you can find. Oliver! is a bit lightheartedwhile this 1948 version is clearly more vivid in its portrayal of evil. Both are very well worth your time.As for the story I won't bother recounting itit's such a familiar story. Instead I want to briefly focus on how it's different from some other versions. Although Oliver Twist is clearly the star of the film this version deemphasizes the boyand focuses a lot more energy on the evil surrounding himsuch as the Beadle and more importantly on the horrid Bill Sykes. You won't find a more vivid portrayal of Sykes Robert Newtonand at times it's a bit hard to watch the guyit's very rough stuff for the time and even today. For instance while the camera doesn't show all of his brutal beating he inflicts it is loud and viciousand the way the camera focuses on the panicstricken dog is brilliant and VERY disturbing. It's also amazing to see Newton's face as he sits there looking at the corpse hours lateras if HE is horrified by his actions! You also see death in the eyes of the animal and in its body languageand is one of the most amazing scenes I can recall from the era. I wonder how they elicited that reaction...I sure hope they didn't do anything horrid to the dog to make it do that.Another portrait in evil that is quite good is Alec Guinness as Fagin. While you might not recognize him under all that makeup it's him in one of his earliest films. An interesting note is that Israel banned the film for its antisemitic portrait though at least unlike the original editions of Oliver Twist at least Fagin isn't constantly referred to as 'the Jew'! I really don't think the portrayal is in itself antisemitic BUT it does feed into a common stereotype of the eraof the wicked and moneyhungry Jew. In fact Dickens himself apparently came to regret how he described Fagin and deemphasized this in later editions removing most of the Jewish references. I would say that Guinness' character was less Jewish and more a subhuman troll! He is cruel and viciousand little like the funny Fagin in Oliver!.Apart from the VERY vivid portraits of evil the biggest star of the film is the great cinematography. There are wonderful shotswith unusual angles and lighting. And because of this the film appears very similar to some American film noir pictures. Lovingly shot that's for sure. Overall a terrific pictureone of the best of the era. And well worth seeing.".

	schema:headline " Excellent adaptation of Charles Dickens great novel Lean does it again.";
	schema:reviewBody "Oliver Twist is my favourite novel. I love it to bits. It is a dark moody hart hitting gritty kind of story considered to be one of the most famous and popular by Charles Dickens. And I think that I am one of the very few teenagers who love Dickens's work. This 1948 British version of the great novel still stands out as the definitive version. Directed by the great Sir David Lean wwho in my opinion is the greatest director ever this film has some absolute quality acting in it. It stars Robert Newton as the brutal Bill Sykes who is just brilliant in the role. He is terrifying in the role. If you have read the book you will realise that he is exactly how Bill Sykes should be. Robert Newton makes him a dark scowling psychotic frightening man who commands your attention every time you see him. Oliver Reed who played him in the 1968 musical version of this story was fine as Bill Sykes but gives a much more light weight performance than Newton does. The rest of the cast was top stuff as well Kay Walsh gave an appealing sympathetic performance as the tragic Nancy clearly sick of the criminal life that she is involved in. The scene where Nancy is eaten to death by Sykes could make you turn away it is that horrible even though we don't see it we just see the dog trying ton escape and hear her screaming. A young John Howard Davies gives a fine performance as the title role of Oliver Twist he made you feel a lot more for him than other child actors do. He doesn't force himself upon us and that is what makes you feel for him because he doesn't try to make you feel for him you just do. The rest of the excellent cast is great Anthony Newly as the Artful Dodger creating just the right essence for him he is a rude imcopetent little bully not a character you are supposed to really feel anything for. Henry Stephenson as the kindly old gentleman Mr Brownlow Francis L Sullivan as the pompous and idiotic beadle Mr Bumble Gibb McLaughlin as the cruel undertaker Mr Sowerberry Ralph Truman as the fraud Mr Monks Kathleen Harrison as the sadistic Mrs Sowerberry Amy Veness as the kindly old Mrs Bedwin Mary Clare as Mrs CornyBumble Graveley Edwards as Mr Fang Michael Dear as the sadistic Noah Claypole Diana Dors in her first major film role as Charlotte and Peter Bull in a cameo role as the landlord of the 'Three Criples' pub. But...and I deliberately saved him until the end Sir Alec Guiness's immortal performance as Fagin is the best best performance in the show. David Lean wasn't sure about whether to cast him as Fagin but it worked brilliantly. He steals the entire film playing the character to absolute perfection from the book. He is soft spoken but at the same time a nasty spiteful evil old man. Ron Moody's acting of Fagin in the musical makes him out to be a crafty pantomime villain who everyone loves...HELLO! DICKENS WANTS YOU TO HATE THIS CHARACTER!. Everyone in this film give absolute 'star A' performances in this film making it hugely enjoyable and truly Dickensian. Of course can only be done properly by the British.While this film is near perfect it does have quite a lot of scenes left out from the book but I don't quarrel with it here because it brings the spirit of Dickens original into it. It would have made the great author proud. Dickens would have undoubtedly hated 'Oliver!' the musical version of this book. Please watch this before you watch the musical please. Then watch the musical for second choice. This film is a true British classic and deserves all the praise it gets.Hope this was useful. Derek".

But...and I deliberately saved him until the end Sir Alec Guiness's immortal performance as Fagin is the best best performance in the show. David Lean wasn't sure about whether to cast him as Fagin but it worked brilliantly. He steals the entire film playing the character to absolute perfection from the book. He is soft spoken but at the same time a nasty spiteful evil old man. Ron Moody's acting of Fagin in the musical makes him out to be a crafty pantomime villain who everyone loves...HELLO! DICKENS WANTS YOU TO HATE THIS CHARACTER!. Everyone in this film give absolute 'star A' performances in this film making it hugely enjoyable and truly Dickensian. Of course can only be done properly by the British.While this film is near perfect it does have quite a lot of scenes left out from the book but I don't quarrel with it here because it brings the spirit of Dickens original into it. It would have made the great author proud. Dickens would have undoubtedly hated 'Oliver!' the musical version of this book. Please watch this before you watch the musical please. Then watch the musical for second choice. This film is a true British classic and deserves all the praise it gets.Hope this was useful. Derek";

	schema:reviewBody "Of the five extant fulllength features based on Charles Dickens's Oliver Twist among which I include the 1968 musical this 1948 version is often considered the yardstick against which all others are measured. It's said that comparisons are odious but it's necessary to examine it in relation to the other four to reveal why it is so highly regarded as well as to some extent debunk its revered status.First we must begin by acknowledging that Dickens's book is a great but somewhat flawed work. It may be considered bad form to even think of criticising an undisputed genius but bear in mind that this was only his second novel and he was a young and inexperienced writer. Oliver Twist's strength lies in its largerthanlife characters sparkling dialogue and imaginative setpieces but structurally it has some huge problems. This is why throughout all the screen versions depictions of figures such as Mr Bumble Fagin and Bill Sykes differ very little key scenes such as asking for more or the handkerchief stealing game are staged similarly but there are many variations as to the overall plot. While the versions made in 1922 and 1933 are faithful if rather pareddown adaptations the screenplay by David Lean and Stanley Haynes was the first to do the unthinkable and rewrite Dickens.Probably the most drastic and for me the most necessary difference between this picture and the novel is Oliver's fate after he is forced to accompany Bill Sikes on the burglary. In the novel he is wounded and taken in by the family whose house it is. However Lean and Haynes do not show the burglary and keep Oliver in the custody of Fagin and co. until the finale. This is a vast improvement as it means Oliver remains in real danger throughout the last act and adds extra motivation to the race to bring the criminals to justice. So crucial to the impact of the picture was this change that it was used again for the 1968 musical and Roman Polanski's 2005 effort and the image of the young hero clambering over the rooftops with Sikes urging him on is now established in the public conscious.However there is one problematic way in which the 1948 film deviates from all the other versions and that is in the size of Nancy's role. She is introduced fairly late after Oliver's arrest and she gets precious little screen time before being murdered. Significantly her fondness for Oliver is not developed she never even speaks to him and consequently it seems odd when suddenly steps in as his protector. She is not even portrayed especially sympathetically and as a result her death is not the blow to the audience that it should be. To me the character of Nancy is the key to the whole thing she is a surrogate mother or big sister figure to Oliver before he finds his real family and her brutal murder is the biggest wrench of the story. Even the 1933 version which otherwise has all the sophistication of a school play recognises this.The 1948 version at least looks great thanks to superlative cinematography by Guy Green and of course the direction of David Lean. This picture is often praised for its harsh and grimy portrayal of Victorian England's underbelly and Lean loads every frame with tone and character. He often throws in shots with no actors which do not contribute directly to the story but add atmosphere to the scene. This kind of shot was by and large a nono in Hollywood at the time and for good reason because it can be a distraction but Lean gets away with it because he does it so well. A great example is the series of storm shots from the opening scene the best of which is a shot of two thorny stems twitching in the wind instantly forcing us to think of physical pain after which we cut to Oliver's mother in agony. The effect is more powerful than would be the shot of her alone. My only complaint with Lean's direction is his tendency to overdirect the lowkey scenes such as the one of Mrs Bumble setting about her husband which is shot in the same manner as Oliver's assault on Noah Claypole but as a scene it deserves far less weight.And then we come to the actors. Aficionados of classic British cinema will understand that noone but Robert Newton could have played Sikes in this production and he's at his eyerolling best here although not as scary as Oliver Reed was in 1968. Kay Walsh is passable but isn't right for Nancy and her casting probably has something to do with who her husband was. Alec Guinness's Fagin has been denounced as antiSemitic in fact it goes right through antiSemitism and out the other side. This caricature with the unfeasibly massive nose and beard flapping around like a bit of old carpet is simply ridiculous. True Fagin is supposed to be a comedy character and to his credit Guinness does ham it up funnily but Oliver Twist is not a farce and that overthetop makeup is all wrong.Through successive stage and screen versions the story of Oliver Twist has continued to evolve. The musical eliminates the subplot with Monks and the 2005 picture even goes as far as to remove the coincidence of Oliver being related to Mr Brownlow. This 1948 adaptation deserves credit for making this process of refinement acceptable which is ironic as in spite of its break with tradition and its flaws through its tone and character it is probably the closest in spirit to the original text.".

	schema:reviewBody "David Lean is best remembered nowadays as the director of the sweeping technicolour epics that he produced in the latter part of his career 'Lawrence of Arabia 1962' and 'The Bridge on the River Kwai 1957' being the most wellknown. However it was interesting to uncover a treasuretrove of little films from Lean's earlier years and 'Oliver Twist 1948' his second adaptation of a Charles Dickens novel is the first that I've watched. The film is a morbid expressionistic triumph of storytelling and atmosphere with Guy Green's exquisite cinematography making the dark shadowy backstreets of 19th century London seem overwhelmingly ominous and sinister. An impressive British cast wonderfully brings the tale to the screen and the audience is presented with an assortment of the author's grotesque unsavoury literary creations. Though the story is frequently very morose occasionally you just wish that one of the characters would break into song just to lighten the mood it was always Dickens' intention to end on a high note and the film's final act will leave you with a cheery smile that you've wellandtruly earned.Though I'd previously read Charles Dicken's 1838 novel I could hardly remember a thing about it so I was never sure of where the story was going to lead. Young Oliver Twist John Howard Davies is born in a workhouse outside London a horrible institution where he is treated poorly and given little to eat. In the film's opening sequence  an aweinspiring completely silent stumble through a rainstorm  we watch Oliver's mother Josephine Stuart on the verge of giving birth arrive at the workhouse dying just minutes after the delivery of her son. Nobody knows exactly who she is nor how she came to be here in any case that final motherly embrace is about the only act of kindness that Oliver will experience for many many years to come. Seriously deprived of food by his wellfed proprietors Oliver innocently approaches the man with the gruel ladle and requests Please sir I want some more. In the ensuing uproar Oliver is sold to a kindly undertaker but a spat with a bullying fellow apprentice leads to his running away towards London. Once there Oliver falls into the care of a gnarled Jewish thief named Fagin Alec Guinness who employs young homeless boys to pickpocket for his own gain.Aside from the superb photography what makes Lean's 'Oliver Twist' such a superb Dickens adaptation are the wonderful characterisations. Alec Guinness usually receives the bulk of the praise and not without good reason for his portrayal of Fagin whose grotesqueness with his twisted grey beard and pointed nose is almost comical. In fact the performance proved somewhat controversial at the time of the film's release with some considering it antisemitic and others objecting to the sympathetic portrayal of a clear villain. Likewise Robert Newton is genuinely chilling as Bill Sikes whose paranoia continually threatens to erupt into an explosion of sadistic violence. Anthony Newley aged seventeen years completely nails the role of Jack Dawkins  a.k.a. the Artful Dodger  a sharpeyed juvenile with all the airs and manners of a man. The Dodger's entrance as he thoughtfully appraises Oliver by the water fountain reveals a legitimate understanding of the character. Of course the film could never have been complete without young John Howard Davies who brings an unrivalled element of intelligence sincerity and independence to the role without ever forgetting that he's playing an innocent nineyearold orphan.".

Guy Green's photography is exceptional his operator was Oswald Morris who later shot the 1968 musical version Oliver! particularly in the early scenes at the workhouse  nineteenthcentury dramas of the MerchantIvory ilk often favour bright sunny colour fantasies whilst Green's dark grimy hardedged blackandwhite visuals are much more evocative of the time. The cast is very good Fagin was the careermaking role for Guinness unrecognisable behind a hasidic beard and a ludicrous false nose but Newton is bigtime scary as evil Bill Sikes and Newley gives a mature performance beyond his years as the thoughtful pragmatic Artful Dodger. A smashing film of an equally smashing book with many memorable scenes Oliver asking for more gruel his induction into Fagin's gang the backalley chase through London Nancy's murder Oliver and Bill on the roof.

Lean's film is a textbook adaptation  the visual elements of the story are exploited to the full the characters spring vividly to life and the montage flows seamlessly together. Guy Green's photography is exceptional his operator was Oswald Morris who later shot the 1968 musical version Oliver! particularly in the early scenes at the workhouse  nineteenthcentury dramas of the MerchantIvory ilk often favour bright sunny colour fantasies whilst Green's dark grimy hardedged blackandwhite visuals are much more evocative of the time. The cast is very good Fagin was the careermaking role for Guinness unrecognisable behind a hasidic beard and a ludicrous false nose but Newton is bigtime scary as evil Bill Sikes and Newley gives a mature performance beyond his years as the thoughtful pragmatic Artful Dodger. A smashing film of an equally smashing book with many memorable scenes Oliver asking for more gruel his induction into Fagin's gang the backalley chase through London Nancy's murder Oliver and Bill on the roof. Trivia  child star Davies who plays Oliver went on to be the original producer of the TV show Monty Python's Flying Circus.";

I saw the 1968 musical which was good but was inflated to 150 minutes with musical numbers and almost came to a stop in some parts. It won an Oscar for Best Picture but the '48 film was better in several respects.First off the acting was superior in the Lean picture. Clive Revill was a pale imitation Alec Guinness as Fagin and Francis L. Sullivan while not a singer was a much better actor than Harry Secombe. And last but not least Robert Newton's interpretation of Bill Sykes was far superior to Oliver Reed's. Reed's Sykes was a bully while Newton imbued the character with a psychopathic element missing from Reed's. It was also remarkable to note the resemblance between John Howard Davies and Mark Lester the two child actors who seemed like twins.The earlier version also conveyed the overarching feeling of hopelessness and the grinding poverty of the lower classes as much a tribute to the art director as to the intelligent script written by Lean himself. Musical director on that version was Muir Mathieson and it doesn't get better than Mathieson. Oliver Twist is one of the best adaptations of literature to the screen as has ever been done.".

	schema:reviewBody "After the acclaim he got in the supporting role of Herbert Pocket in Great Expectations David Lean decided to use Alec Guinness in a starring role in his next masterpiece. Which turned out to be another Dickens story with Guinness playing Fagin in Oliver Twist.It was not an automatic casting however other people were considered. But according to a recent biography of Alec Guinness he won the part by appearing in the full Fagin makeup you see on the screen with that unforgettable Cyrano like nose with a hook in it. He also spoke in that mincing lisp and Lean was sold.The portrait of Fagin raised a great hue and cry about it being so good that it was encouraging antiSemitism not something the post World War II world wanted to deal with. And the lisp and the mincing walk also had a nice subtext of homophobia with Fagin and his crew of young juvenile thieves. All around it got plenty of criticism Oliver Twist was not released in the USA until three years later and then with significant cuts in Guinness's role.Whereas Guinness just went outrageously overboard in his acting he was matched every step of the way by the menacing Robert Newton as Bill Sikes one of the slimiest villains in all of literature. Newton as Sikes is a totally ruthless character and scare the audience as he frightens the rest of the cast.My favorite though is Kay Walsh as Nancy Brown Sikes's luckless girlfriend. The only character you can compare Nancy to that comes to mind is another woman from 19th century London who fell victim to an evil man is Champagne Ivy in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.In the musical Oliver the big hit song from it is As Long As He Needs Me which is Nancy's number. She sings it about her love for her evil fellow you can almost hear it in the background. What a payoff this poor woman gets for her love when she develops a conscience.Charles Dickens certainly liked stories about young men who by an unseen fate first get cast down and then in the end triumph over adversity by their own efforts but also by events they have no control over. Oliver Twist fits right in with Great Expectations David Copperfield and Martin Chuzzlewit in that way. This version still remains the definitive adaption of a classic story and you kids should see this if you don't want to wade through the book for your English class.".

	schema:headline " Enigmatic and thoughtful and all about the pointlessness of lives and careers";
	schema:reviewBody "The Desert of the Tartars is an epic movie where nothing happens over 2 hours and 21 minutes...except to show us the gradual and fascinating disintegration of a group of military officers in an isolated outpost of empire who are full of pride and who lead lives as pointless as their careers. It helped me understand things better when I looked up the author Dino Buzzati. His book was published in 1940 shortly after he had served some time in Ethiopia as Mussolini postured and killed his way to a new Roman empire. Many thought the book was a veiled reference to the sort of empty grandiosity Mussolini embodied. The book became widely available only after WWII. Here we have a group of officers none of whom have ever seen combat except for one who can barely move awaiting an attack that may never happen whose purpose in their lives can only come about through glorious battle. And some of these officers are convinced that some sort of activity far off in the desert can sometimes be seen. Can it be the ghosts and dreams of the longago Tartar invaders? They talk of the enemy as if it were some anonymous thing. The atmosphere is claustrophobic with the lives of these men governed by punctilious manners and regulations. These are officers whose code of conduct has them practice fencing with each other while their men wait behind machine guns. We see all this through Lieutenant Drogo Jacques Perrin who arrives at Fort Bastiano a great hulking desert fortress made of mud brick in 1907 on his first posting. Beyond the fort there is a desert he is told. And then nothing. The desert of the Tartars. They may even have crossed it centuries ago but they vanished after destroying the ancient city. The desert has kept their name. But the older that history is the more men change it into legend. So we don't know what's true and what isn't. In my view the sad heart of the film is Captain Horvitz played with great power by Max von Sydow. Years ago Horvitz had seen the lights of the enemy had given the alarm and no attack occurred. He has refused all opportunity to leave Fort Bastiano. Years pass and he becomes commanding officer. In time he is sent away. I hope you will be in command of the fort when the enemy will attack he tells Captain Drogo as he prepares to leave and I know it will even if I was ordered to ignore it. What nonsense and what disregard. I might have been useful in wartime. I'm so regretful. I waited for such a long time...without knowing why... Many officers we met with Lt. Drogo have died become unbalanced and in many cases have been simply sent away as their superiors gradually have reduced the strength of the fort. More time slips away and Drogo now second in command gray and ill is in turn sent away from the fort. Drogo had become as fixated on Fort Bastiano and the enemy as Horvitz became....and yet now there seems there may be a genuine attack. Yet when Drogo was still new to the fort he was convinced that his posting was an error. The sympathetic doctor gives him a letter with a medical reason for a new assignment. You are wise to leave Doctor Major Rovin tells him. I was sent here by mistake Drogo tries to explain. Here or elsewhere Rovin tells Drogo we're all somewhere by mistake. This sense of passionless inevitability runs through the film. One would think that nearly twoandahalf hours of this would be tedious. It isn't. The director Valerio Zerlini explores some serious themes. Is there an enemy or not? Has the fort been purposefully weakened for unknown schemes? Where actually is the fort located? It seems it takes only three days by horseback to reach the middle of the desert after leaving the green hills and valleys of Italy...or is it even Italy? I don't think any of this matters. The film for me is an allegory of how easily men can slip into the pointlessness of duty pride obedience and glory. Well this approach may be a bit existential but we can make what we want of it as we see the progression of disintegration played off against the essential meaninglessness of these men's lives. What helps the movie immeasurably are two other factors. First there is a whole roster of firstrate skilled European actors all of whom know how to underplay. In addition to von Sydow we have Vittorio Gassman Helmut Griem Philippe Noiret Fernando Rey JeanLouis Trintignant and Giuliano Gemma among others. Second there is the looming presence of the desert and Fort Bastiano itself. Much of the film was shot in Iran in the ancient city of Bam. Fort Bastiano is actually ArgeBam the Citadel of Bam. The citadel and the ancient town next to it were built of mud brick and straw eons ago. When I saw the first shot of Fort Bastiano I thought I must be seeing some early version of Computer Generated Overkill. The Citadel of Bam was huge towering over the ancient ruins. Tragically a massive earthquake hit Iran in 2003 with Bam at the epicenter. The only thing remaining of the Citadel literally is a huge mound of claybrick rubble. Iran says the Citadel will be rebuilt but it will take years. It is a huge cultural loss.".

	schema:headline " A Masterful Adaptation and a Cinematic Masterpiece";
	schema:reviewBody "I read Dino Buzzati's novel The Tartar Steppe in 2008. The delicacy and depth with which it tackled ideas and feelings central to human existence plus the beauty and weightlessness of the writing made it one of my favourite novels. Then I discovered Valerio Zurlini an Italian director unknown to me had adapted it to cinema. For more than a year I relished in the idea of watching this movie.Long before watching it I had already heard Ennio Morricone's score which brought to mind the sadness and nostalgia the novel produced in me. My interest grew as I contemplated seeing how the movie and music would complement each other. I've now seen the movie and although my favourite tracks don't play as much as I wish they did Il Deserto dei Tartari will remain forever as one of the most enjoyable and most beautiful film experiences of my life.The movie follows the novel closely plotwise young Lieutenant Drogo leaves the Kingdom's capital to take his post at the remote border Fortress of Bastiano where soldiers and officers have held watch for decades in anticipation of an attack from the mysterious Tartars the desert people on the other side of the border. Bastiano is a dead place and unsuitable for anyone wanting to make a name for himself in the army since there's little evidence there will ever be a war there. But some endure and wait patiently for the day their patience will be rewarded and war comes and they can achieve glory.Poor Drogo is caught in this oppressive game of patience constantly torn between the idea of leaving the shame of leaving or deserting as he feels it or staying and waiting for the Tartars. As the years and decades pass the movie shows us what men will sacrifice for a moment to validate their absurd existence how they'll waste their entire lives waiting for something that may never come.In this atmosphere friends leave others die. Some grow old and retire some are promoted. And always life goes on without much change. In a movie where fundamental aspects of human life are explored it's no wonder that this movie is filled with scenes of intimacy and beauty. It's always heartbreaking when friends bid farewell and there are many farewell scenes in this movie some of the best I've seen. It's also sad to see when Tartars are spotted and the soldiers build up hopes only to have them thwarted again and again.The cast gathers some of the best European actors of the time Jacques Perrin plays Drogo Vittorio Gassman plays the Fortress' Colonel Filimore an experienced and sensible man who contrasts with Major Mattis Giuliano Gemma a fanatic for rules and order. Max Von Sydow gives my favourite performance of the movie as Hortiz a seasoned officer who embodies the hope that one's life dedicated to the Fortress will be validated by a Tartar attack. Smaller roles are filled in by amazing actors like JeanLouis Trintignant Francisco Rabal Fernando Rey Philippe Noirte and Helmut Griem.From a visual point of view the movie is gorgeous. I read that Zurlini used Giorgio de Chirico's paintings to capture the feel of silence and stillness of the movie and it shows. As the screen fills with vast landscapes and decrepit buildings one can see de Chirico's mysterious piazzas and desolate buildings. Complemented by one of Morricone's best scores Il Deserto dei Tartari stands as a great cinematic achievement.".

	onyx:emotionText "I read Dino Buzzati's novel The Tartar Steppe in 2008. The delicacy and depth with which it tackled ideas and feelings central to human existence plus the beauty and weightlessness of the writing made it one of my favourite novels. Then I discovered Valerio Zurlini an Italian director unknown to me had adapted it to cinema. For more than a year I relished in the idea of watching this movie.Long before watching it I had already heard Ennio Morricone's score which brought to mind the sadness and nostalgia the novel produced in me. My interest grew as I contemplated seeing how the movie and music would complement each other. I've now seen the movie and although my favourite tracks don't play as much as I wish they did Il Deserto dei Tartari will remain forever as one of the most enjoyable and most beautiful film experiences of my life.The movie follows the novel closely plotwise young Lieutenant Drogo leaves the Kingdom's capital to take his post at the remote border Fortress of Bastiano where soldiers and officers have held watch for decades in anticipation of an attack from the mysterious Tartars the desert people on the other side of the border. Bastiano is a dead place and unsuitable for anyone wanting to make a name for himself in the army since there's little evidence there will ever be a war there. But some endure and wait patiently for the day their patience will be rewarded and war comes and they can achieve glory.Poor Drogo is caught in this oppressive game of patience constantly torn between the idea of leaving the shame of leaving or deserting as he feels it or staying and waiting for the Tartars. As the years and decades pass the movie shows us what men will sacrifice for a moment to validate their absurd existence how they'll waste their entire lives waiting for something that may never come.In this atmosphere friends leave others die. Some grow old and retire some are promoted. And always life goes on without much change. In a movie where fundamental aspects of human life are explored it's no wonder that this movie is filled with scenes of intimacy and beauty. It's always heartbreaking when friends bid farewell and there are many farewell scenes in this movie some of the best I've seen. It's also sad to see when Tartars are spotted and the soldiers build up hopes only to have them thwarted again and again.The cast gathers some of the best European actors of the time Jacques Perrin plays Drogo Vittorio Gassman plays the Fortress' Colonel Filimore an experienced and sensible man who contrasts with Major Mattis Giuliano Gemma a fanatic for rules and order. Max Von Sydow gives my favourite performance of the movie as Hortiz a seasoned officer who embodies the hope that one's life dedicated to the Fortress will be validated by a Tartar attack. Smaller roles are filled in by amazing actors like JeanLouis Trintignant Francisco Rabal Fernando Rey Philippe Noirte and Helmut Griem.From a visual point of view the movie is gorgeous.

	schema:headline " A profoundly important if not exactly 'great' film";
	schema:reviewBody "The fact that this film ever got made is a marvel. Some of the biggest stars of European cinema got together with Zurlini to make this oneofakind film about boredom and existential despair. The profound emptiness lurking within every man as he tries to cope with an absurd existence and which always looks for an escape through some distraction or mindlessness such as war pointless work perversion etc.rather than face the frightful prospect of coming to terms with itself IS the subject of this film and NO COMPROMISE WHATSOEVER is made to please the audience.  The pace of the film is slow and methodical deliberately making the audience become as bored and uncomfortable as the protagonists. However if you know this or sense it you are no longer bored but aware of the film's intentions and fascinated.  When the finale comes to bring together all that went before the understaed effect is overwhelming. One shot in particular that of the Tartars suddenly appearing over the hills way out in the distance is so fantastic that it becomes etched in your mind forever. The story is about a military officer Jacques Perrin sent to a fort somewhere in the middle of a godforsaken desert where the endless similarity of the days nearly drive him nuts to the point where he comes to hope for a war or attack of some kind to change things. He's hoping for anything that'll distract him from feeling the emptiness inside and can't find it. The plot is the laboratory experiment by which Zurlini expounds his view of the eternal isolation of man from man and the essential absurdity of existence. Some of the most bizzarely fascinating location photography is featured but the tone of the film is intentionally 'dry' and 'nonpoetic' unlike the very poetic way his previous film The Professor starring Alain Delon was made for instanceand most of the stars except for Von Sydow and Trintignant have relatively small roles. Trintignant is pretty hilarious in his role as the fort's doctor. Overall Desert of the Tartars is a nottoosuccessful its impact is nowhere near the level achieved by Antonioni's The Passenger for instance but still thoroughly fascinating experiment in uncompromising dramatic cinema.".

The camerawork is stunning the location in Iran is breathtaking magical. The acting is extraordinary  this film is a meeting place for some great actors. There is often little dialogue and so we feel accutely the presence that these actors have  Gassman Perrin Trintignant Gemma Von Syndow etc. For me so much of the film is about the feeling that is created not the specifics of the storyline. The actors have a wonderful sincerity  a lot of eye contact demonstrates the closeness that these people feel at a human level.The story  I have not read the novel therefore I do not claim to have any clear idea of the exact message but for me the film is about the feeling it creates. It made me reflect. Not so much on understanding the meaning but on the characters themselves and the various emotions we have as humans.I did however feel that the pace and feeling of the film changes after Perrin is sent back to the fort after his request for a transfer is declined. A lot of the peacefulness of the film goes and a more agitated atmosphere prevails.Nothing is made clear  mystery prevails. The final shot of the approaching horsemen is unforgettable. Morricone's score is toprate.Altogether an extraordinary work  images characters and acting that that left a strong impression on me. I am very curious to see more Zurlini.I have the Italian DVD of this film. I am very tempted to buy the NoShame DVD for the quality of their releases and the extras.".

Unsurprisingly perhaps it is hardly ever shown on Italian TV  with the most recent occasion being on the very last day of my 3month stay in Hollywood late last year which meant that I had to miss it although I was already aware of No Shame's 2Disc Set which was released around the same time.The cast is made up of a onceinalifetime roster of international film stars Vittorio Gassman Giuliano Gemma Helmut Griem Philippe Noiret who died last week alas Jacques Perrin who has the lead role and also did duty as one of the producers Francisco Rabal Fernando Rey Laurent Terzieff JeanLouis Trintignant and Max von Sydow! Incredibly it's Gemma who stands out in a rare villainous turn as the sadistic Major  though Max von Sydow as the disgraced Captain and Vittorio Gassman as the ageing Commander of the Fort are quietly impressive in their own way. While the first half is deliberatelypaced eliciting its own particular ambiance and etching all the various characters by comparison the latter stages are somewhat rushed  as the years fly by and the fort changes its command several times so as to bring the story to its main theme  that of the remote company seen constantly drilling in the hope of an attack by enemy forces which when it finally arrives they seem incapable of dealing with adequately! The beautiful cinematography of the splendid Iranian desert location with the interiors filmed in Rome is by Luciano Tovoli and Ennio Morricone's score rendered in its entirety on the CD found in No Shame's SE DVD is suitably majestic and melancholic. The supplements then aren't prolific but quite nicely done nevertheless  though only Tovoli's 35minute interview goes into any real detail about the making of the film and even that includes copious references to his collaborations with other Italian masters such as Michelangelo Antonioni and Dario Argento.".

This is because the slow moving and contemplative first half of the film follows the setting up of the main military officer characters between each other and with their men while the second half of the film speeds up the pace of the diegetic time and focuses more on the reactions of the officers to the world outside their fortress rather than within it. The reason for these comparisons are that unlike three of those four mentioned influences this 140 minute long color 1976 film by Italian director Valerio Zurlini with a screenplay by Andr G. Brunelin based on a novel by Dino Buzzati called The Tartar Steppe is a film almost hermetically sealed from laughter. Having stated that it's not a film that is overly somber. It is the sort of film like those in the canons of Bela Tarr Theo Angelopolous and John Cassavetes that is simply nonpareil in the sense that there really is no other film like it for good or ill.

He is rescued by beautiful Gail Russell a Quaker girl with a strong silent father and a marvelous generous mother who makes donuts and cakes that melt in your mouth but according to her are not very good the flour you know....Poor Quirt never has a chance.  He is healed body and soul by this devoted family.  But not before he must taste his old way of life one more time which leads to a dramatic conclusion.John Wayne never looked better on film then in The Angel and The Badman. In one scene he wakes from a coma hears a noise gropes for his gun which is under the pillow and rises gun in hand to face a startled and stunning Russell.  The sight of John Wayne shirtless his hair uncombed and his gorgeous almost purple eyes taking in the lovely lady in front of him is something no woman from 6 to 106 should miss.  If you are a fan already and have seen this delightful film you know what I mean.  If you are new to John Wayne check to one out and fall in love.Harry Carey plays the Marshal of the territory who keeps track of Quirt not completely convinced of his conversion until the surprising climax. Carey's quiet authority is wonderful to watch and his sly humor a tonic.The Dr. here overplays his role but he can be forgiven.  The neighbor who has denied water to the Quaker settlement but is convinced by Quirtwithout the force of his famous gun to be a good neighbor and remove the top two boards holding back the water that used to flow into flums and irrigation ditches is a real old west character.  Films today just don't use actors with faces like his any longer.  Too bad.Yes indeed The Angel and The Badman is a wonderful old fashioned  film. The kind they don't make any longer but should.".

The sight of John Wayne shirtless his hair uncombed and his gorgeous almost purple eyes taking in the lovely lady in front of him is something no woman from 6 to 106 should miss.  If you are a fan already and have seen this delightful film you know what I mean.  If you are new to John Wayne check to one out and fall in love.Harry Carey plays the Marshal of the territory who keeps track of Quirt not completely convinced of his conversion until the surprising climax. Carey's quiet authority is wonderful to watch and his sly humor a tonic.The Dr. here overplays his role but he can be forgiven.  The neighbor who has denied water to the Quaker settlement but is convinced by Quirtwithout the force of his famous gun to be a good neighbor and remove the top two boards holding back the water that used to flow into flums and irrigation ditches is a real old west character.  Films today just don't use actors with faces like his any longer.  Too bad.Yes indeed The Angel and The Badman is a wonderful old fashioned  film. The kind they don't make any longer but should.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Angel and the Badman is a milestone film in the career of John Wayne. It was the first film in which he had a substantial role behind the camera. My guess is that he must have lobbied Herbert J. Yates at Republic films for some creative control and Yates gave in to his studio's biggest moneymaker. Though Wayne at times didn't have the best judgment in regard to his own personal projects The Angel and the Badman is a winner in every way and doesn't get near enough credit for the work it is except from Wayne partisans. Wayne plays young gun hand Quirt Evans a most feared man in the territory who wounded falls in the hands of a Quaker family who nurses him back to health. Wayne starts eying pretty daughter Gail Russell.Pretty soon under her influence Wayne starts questioning the direction his life's been going in. Of course the Quakers do cheat a little on this question themselves. Though they don't believe in violence the Duke's reputation as a gun hand comes in mighty handy in settling at least one neighborly dispute with Paul Hurst.My favorite scene in the film and one of Wayne's best in all his films also involves his reputation. When Bruce Cabot and two henchmen find him at the Quaker home Wayne runs one terrific bluff holding them off with an empty gun. This was the first time Wayne and Cabot worked together. In the sixties Cabot became a regular in Wayne films.Angel and the Badman also has two other Wayne attempted reclamation projects. Gail Russell was one of the most beautiful women ever on the silver screen. She had a lot of tragedy in her life and died young. Wayne at one point gave her the lead in a film Seven Men from Now that he was producing but not starring in with Randolph Scott. She gave a good performance but a lot of substance abuse had taken its toll.Paul Hurst later on got a pay day from Wayne in Big Jim McLain in a scene he portrayed from a wheelchair. He was terminally ill with cancer and in fact took his own life shortly afterwards. The money was no doubt needed for Hurst's medical expenses. Later on in McLintock Wayne said in one scene he doesn't give jobs he hires men and women. This was his idea of charity and something that never gets talked about enough by people even some of Wayne's most devoted fans.As this was his first film as producer I have no doubt that the Duke wanted Harry Carey the man he patterned his cowboy image after in this film. One of Carey's best screen performances as the patient federal marshal who's waiting for Cabot and Wayne to shoot it out so he can hang the winner. Wayne's good friend James Edward Grant wrote and directed the film. Later on Frank Capra disparaged Grant as a bad influence on Wayne when they quarreled during the filming of Circus World. Grant did write some of the more conservative on Wayne's films. But I certainly can't fault anything he did in The Angel and the Badman.In fact it's a winner in just about every respect. Even some Wayne haters might like this one.".

Penelope is a gentle Quaker woman living in the wilderness of the Old West. She and her parents model their lives on the teachings of scripture especially the Love your neighbor ideal. Quirt gets shot in one of his many battles with gun wielding black hat bad guys Penelope's family takes him in and nurses him back to health during which time Quirt and Penelope get a look at each other with the obvious chemical reaction. Her sweet and vulnerable demeanor mixes splendidly with his gruff but awkwardly gentle persona.When Wayne's nemesis Laredo Bruce Cabot shows up Wayne is faced with the conflict of adapting the peaceful ways of Penelope or reverting to his violent shootfirstandaskquestionslater lifestyle. Wayne's inner conflict to change his outlook on life is illustrated well a great performance for the Duke. This all goes on under the watchful eye of the Marshall Harry Carey who serves as not only a foil for Wayne constantly threatening him but almost like a selfappointed guardian who sees Quirt's potential for good trying to steer him toward the light. Carey's humor and good spirit plays off Wayne perfectly.The film builds to a brilliant finish with Quirt forced to choose between peace or violence once and for all. One of my favorite westerns.

When he is shot the Quaker family takes care of him and after he wakes up the daughter Gail Russell falls in love with him. It's goofy and clich sure but there's a really fine movie to be found in the familiar setup. Writerdirector Grant create many good vignettes. There are several wonderful supporting characters who add a lot of worth to the proceedings including Harry Carey as a marshall Lee Dixon as one of Quirt's friends and old partners in crime Tom Powers as the local scientific atheist doctor and Olin Howlin as the town telegrapher. Howlin's character is pure comic relief very humorously claiming a long friendship with Quirt though he only saw him once when he was almost unconscious. Then Carey's character is wryly comedic as the marshall he's constantly stalking Quirt. He's sure that someday he'll get to hang the guy and he harps on it constantly. The chemistry between Wayne and Russell adds an unexpected poignancy to the film. The scene where the two pick blackberries is simply beautiful and their wordless climactic exchange is perfectly performed. Good action sequences as well. 910.".

The cool detachment of his character reminds us that he is really more dangerous than the young Penny Gail Russell perceives and more thoughtful than those who know him as a gunfighter understand.As dramatic action film the film is well paced and glows with considerable polish throughout. The production team is that of John Ford's of the time and they are in top form here. Writerdirector Grant another Ford insider has given us an excellent script and able direction.The film was produced by John Wayne himself who knew a good story and who here allows us an odd insight into his personal politics  which were far more complicated than his rightwing fans or leftwing detractors ever understood. In the wake of the Second World War and we all remember Wayne's war films Wayne here produced one of the best defenses of religionbased pacifism on film. It should be remembered that during the First World War Woodrow Wilson had pacifists jailed in a little known incident in Wyoming Army recruiters dragged several Amish into jail and beat them brutally  several died. If I had to choose between Woodrow Wilson and John Wayne for president I'd vote for Wayne.Angel and the Badman speaks well of Wayne's conscience and reminds us that in his own rough way he could respect the honest consciences of others. Whatever else we think of him let us remember that he was a man who deserved  and gave  respect. This is over all the most respectful film he ever made giving us his most respectable performance.".

	schema:reviewBody "Whatever else this pacifist Western gives Wayne his best last line of any film in that long and storied career. I've forgotten who first called the movie a pacifist Western but the description fits. For that reason I expect it's not every Wayne fan's cup of tea. Certainly the tender emotions of family and stability win out in the end and Wayne's hellraising past is tamed by a good woman with strong moral character. Of course this was before he became a macho icon and so the risk to an established career was not as great. Still there are submissive moments with Russell he never again repeats on screen.It's telling that Wayne himself produced the movie so what's up there had to pass his executive muster. It's also wellknown that he and Russell were involved in a hopeless romantic relationship he was a married Catholic. My guess is that that personal involvement accounts for many of the film's unusual features. Note for example the extended time given to Russell's cutesy reactions to the injured Wayne's delirious ramblings or the many indulgent closeups of Russell emoting. Note also how relaxed the famously edgy stage fright Russell appears. I'm not saying these features necessarily harm the film itself. In fact the love scenes manage a warmth and authenticity rare for Hollywood makebelieve. What I am suggesting is that a behindthescenes personal story may account for much of this notable departure from Wayne's macho norm.Speaking of Wayne it's often alleged that his acting abilities were limited and superstardom depended on other factors. But consider one particularly demanding scene. The Quaker family's skinflint neighbor Carson Paul Hurst has just reconciled with them and is happily taking home a load of pies from Mrs. Worth. To the asyet unreformed Wayne he remarks about how good helping his neighbors makes him feel. Watch Wayne's wellshaded reactions that nevertheless pass by quickly. At first he looks puzzled as though as a tough guy he never considered the possible connection which passes quickly into a glimmer of understanding as he considers what the connection means which then passes into a sudden worried look once he realizes that even as a free spirit he too is vulnerable to the same taming process. It's a marvelously executed little sequence condensed into maybe a 5 second span demonstrating the kind of acting ability Wayne was seldom called upon to show. The movie itself amounts to a generally entertaining blend of action and sentiment note how the skeptical doctor's role works to prevent the screenplay from becoming too sanctimonious. The producers also wisely popped for some great Arizona location shots that keep the eye interested even when the story wanders indoors. It's mostly tongueincheek since the bad guys aren't really so bad plus the considerable humor that includes a mock barroom brawl. The buckboard chase makes for an exciting centerpiece even if the final plunge is not too believable since Russell is supposed to be aboard. Two complaints the process shots are poorly done for a studio Republic that specialized in action effects while killingoff the two bad guys in the end strikes me as a mistake. A shaming before running them out of the territory would appear more in keeping with the movie's overall mood. Nonetheless this is a rather surprisingly good little movie considering the many ways it could have gone badly wrong.".

	onyx:emotionText "Whatever else this pacifist Western gives Wayne his best last line of any film in that long and storied career. I've forgotten who first called the movie a pacifist Western but the description fits. For that reason I expect it's not every Wayne fan's cup of tea. Certainly the tender emotions of family and stability win out in the end and Wayne's hellraising past is tamed by a good woman with strong moral character. Of course this was before he became a macho icon and so the risk to an established career was not as great.

	schema:reviewBody "This film is one of the great classics of cinema history nearly perfect in every way. I have to confess I never heard of it until I bought the DVD in Paris out of curiosity because I like Gail Russell. Watching it with French subtitles was hysterically funny in terms of the language differences 'Hey boss!' is translated 'He Patron!' and countless other mirthful examples. As usual the French cineastes have shown great taste in treating this film as an international classic transcending all cultural boundaries. To call it a 'Western' is to condemn it to provincialism. It is far more than that. The luminous presence of the velvety shy and melancholy Gail Russell is truly the presence of an angel and it is as if heaven were lighting the shots for her. She can never have delivered a better performance nor in my opinion did John Wayne ever find better magic with a leading lady even his chum Maureen O'Hara with whom he had such jolly roustabouts in more rough and tumble films later on. This film has a pervasive gentle humour which is delightful. Wayne himself is the perfect puer aeternus eternal boy wrinkling up his tough guy's visage in an instant into a childlike puzzlement and instant surrender to the playful Gail Russell's commands on a docile and comical yes ma'am basis. They are like two tenyearolds playing together oblivious of the camera. Botticelli could not have drawn a more perfect angel for this fable. Who cares about the story just sit back and watch this magic as if you were peeking through the doors of some lost paradise. Never would John Wayne rise so high again this was his peak. And this was Gail Russell at her most glorious her most divine. When you die take this one with you.".

The video lacks the high detail one expects from digital playback.  The contrast range is compressed and requires fiddling with display controls to get almost acceptable brightness range.  Another interesting and annoying issue is the constant blue and pink sparkle in and otherwise black and white image.  The playback seems to jitter slightly as if the framing is not consistent.  How could this be?  When played back on a PC the answer becomes clear.  At the top of the image the observant and knowledgeable viewer will spy the first line of scan beginning part way across the screen.  This is an artifact of interlace scanning and indicates this DVD's video source originated from a VHS tapenot the original film print.  This is a very sloppy conversion with apparently no attention to details important to creating a quality product such as captioning or alternate languages.

Here she shows lust in her heart for Wayne and their chemistry is the best part of the movie.As I said the plot is fairly simple  it was obvious from their first encounter that Wayne and his nemesis Bruce Cabot would have a climatic showdown before the movie ends.

Quirt will have to choose between his way and the Quaker way which means choosing Penelope or the gun.John Wayne is really good in this one. He's a very underrated actor that is often slighted by people that don't like the man usually because they don't like his politics or something along those lines. But he was actually a very good actor who brought depth to most of the characters he played. Here he gets to show his softer side and it's one of his best performances from the '40s. Gail Russell is young and very pretty here. She does a great job in one of her two bestknown films the other being The Uninvited. Russell and Wayne have terrific chemistry. It's sad how her life turned out as she had the potential to be one of the greats. Harry Carey Sr. plays a grizzled old marshal dubious of whether Quirt can change. As was often the case he stands out above the pack. An excellent actor who could say more with a smile or a look than most could with a page of dialogue. Amusingly there are characters in this movie named Hondo and McClintock both names for future Wayne characters. It's a charming and enjoyable western that fans of the Duke will love but also I think people who don't normally like westerns can enjoy.".

Evans is an amiable patient but he has scores to settle and this sets up the tension of the film. The longer he stays with the family the more they cut away at his rough edges providing an anchor in an otherwise lawless West.There are a couple of back stories going on in the film for one outlaw Laredo Stevens Bruce Cabot is a thorn in Evans' side. He and his gang attempt to rustle a herd of horses only to be foiled by Evans and his partner Randy McCall Lee Dixon. Randy is enthralled by the Bible given to Quirt by the Quaker congregation and takes to reading it in any spare moment. Then there's the territorial marshal Wistful McClintock Harry Carey who it seems has made a career out of bringing Evans to justice. His remarks are some of the highlights of the film  I'm patient that's what hangs all you fellas in the end I'm patient. His regard for Evans' reputation though is almost respectful  You know Quirt I always figured on usin' a new rope in hangin' you.Evans is respectful of the Quaker family's ways he hangs his holstered gun outside never allowing it inside the home. When he takes Penelope on a wagon ride to pick blackberries he leaves it behind in deference to her wishes. When Quirt shows up in town to call out Laredo Stevens the Worth family arrives on the scene and in what could be a fatal mistake Evans gives up his gun to face Laredo weaponless. It would have been a tragic finale if not for the vigilant Marshal McClintock. As Evans makes his way home with the Worths the Marshal picks up Evans' gun and proclaims to hang it in his office along with a new rope in memory of the adversary who never was. Released in 1947 by Republic Pictures The Angel and the Badman comes some dozen years or so after Wayne's Lone Star films which all followed a similar formula. Although a B Western it's got a quality to the filming and story line that make it rise a considerable notch above his mid 1930's films.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was all right about what I'd expect from a madefortv movie.I had three problems with this film.  The first is that I figured out the surprise plot twist that occurs at the end of the movie very early on in the movie.  Maybe it comes from being a psychology major.  Or maybe it was blatantly obvious.My second problem was the way in which the characters behaved at the end of the movie.  While I agree that in such a situation otherwise normal people may behave in atypical illogical extreme behavior.  However I thought this film made such behaviors too extreme this is the same problem I had with Lord of the Flies where children turn into murdering cannibals when left alone on an island for awhile.  I get the point both this film and Lord of the Flies were trying to make but I think they both overstated it.My third problem with this film is the characters themselves.  There was very little depth to them and they tended to be quite stereotyped.  This problem likely arises from the fact that there are several important characters to flush out and only 2 hours minus commercials to do it in. Because of this I think they should have either limited the number of people in the shelter to about 8 or they should have picked one or two characters and told it from their perspective.This movie was a good way to waste time when I was having problems sleeping. If you want a movie that deals with either nuclear attack or the problems with a bunch of people confined to a small space in an intellectual intriguing manner this is not the movie for you.  However if you just want to waste a couple hours this movie is great because if you end up having something you have to do or if you can finally fall asleep or whatever because this film does not engage you enough to prevent you from turning off the television.".

	onyx:emotionText "This movie was all right about what I'd expect from a madefortv movie.I had three problems with this film.  The first is that I figured out the surprise plot twist that occurs at the end of the movie very early on in the movie.  Maybe it comes from being a psychology major.  Or maybe it was blatantly obvious.My second problem was the way in which the characters behaved at the end of the movie.  While I agree that in such a situation otherwise normal people may behave in atypical illogical extreme behavior.  However I thought this film made such behaviors too extreme this is the same problem I had with Lord of the Flies where children turn into murdering cannibals when left alone on an island for awhile.  I get the point both this film and Lord of the Flies were trying to make but I think they both overstated it.My third problem with this film is the characters themselves.  There was very little depth to them and they tended to be quite stereotyped.

	schema:reviewBody "Hanover Street is the kind of movie people like to pick apart because the SS Sgt. didn't render the proper Hitler salute or the uniforms were wrong or because the B25 wasn't flown over Europe but mostly in North Africa. Well I imagine the B25 sets were left over from Catch 22 which used B25s and there was a shortage of SS uniforms at Elstree Studios when this movie was filmed. It doesn't really detract from the film. These are bits of entertainment  not a masters level thesis. I have to say this is an adult movie that probably wouldn't be made today. If filmed today late 2005 then there'd be a lot more emphasis on wiseass remarks to the commanding officer and silly stilted lines like If I lost you then I'd just die ... oh I'd just die. Pretty much along the lines of 2001's awful Pearl Harbor. The love story is really more about honor and sacrifice than love and reflects closely wartime England when many single and probably married English women dashed off with heroic Yanks  which gave way to the British saying about Americans Over paid over sexed and bloody well over here. There's a lot of action in this movie and a lot of tension that builds up at the right moments. Is it a big blockbuster movie like Raiders of The Lost Ark? No but it's got a good script the cinemaphotography is outstanding and the score is perfect. Aside from Catch 22 there's not a lot of places you can see REAL B25s lining up for takeoff in a film sorry again the Pearl Harbor CGI doesn't cut it for me and the fearlaced banter between Ford's bomber crew seems closer to the real thing than the heroic bull from other movies. If there's a gripe I've got about this film it's Ford's haircut. You can see a lot of detail and expense in the Hanover Street set the Blitz and even the airfield. Everybody looks up to 1940s standards and the set has that smokefilled perpetual autumn look that seems to be what people associate with early color films from the World War II era. However Ford's 1978 shag kind of ruins the mood. Maybe he couldn't cut his hair because Empire Strikes Back was due to start lensing soon after Hanover Street went into post production ... who knows but it detracts from the detail paid to the extras and the set. Still Hanover Street is a good film.".

	schema:headline " Engaging wartime love triangle notable for husband  lover dynamic";
	schema:reviewBody "While this movie is not the old fashioned wartime classic I had anticipated it is certainly highly watchable. This is definitely more a romance than a war movie or suspense thriller. It's been awhile since I've seen it so forget all the plot intricacies but enjoyed the film at the time for two reasons. First the incredible cast and second the World War II backdrop with all the drama of wartime and the hair clothing  automobile styles. For me the movie is noteworthy for the dynamics between the sophisticated steady husband and the virile charismatic lover. Also its memorable ending which I loved. The movie portrays the story of Margaret Sellinger a British nurse and David Halloran an American pilot stationed in England who meet in London during an air raid and fall in love. David doesn't realize that Margaret is married until he is assigned to transport a British secret agent into France and learns that this agent is none other than Margaret's husband. Of course this situation may be something of a coincidence but it does make for a good story. The three stars cast as the parties in this love triangle are all favourites of mine. The dashing and magnetic Harrison Ford plays the lover David. That consummate gentleman Christopher Plummer is cast as the older dependable and consistent husband Paul Sellinger. The lovely LeslieAnne Down of Upstairs Downstairs fame portrays Paul's wife Margaret the woman caught between these two very compelling men. Frankly if I had to choose myself between Harrison Ford and Christopher Plummer I'd be hard pressed to decide...though Plummer would have been quite captivating enough for me in the first place! The movie doesn't delve much into the marital problems other than that the husband Paul doesn't feel he is exciting enough for his wife. The film therefore provides no reason why we shouldn't favour the husband and view him as the injured victim of the piece. Not a whole lot of sympathy on my part for the bored Margaret wartime or not and despite Harrison Ford's obvious appeal. Unfortunately not much detail is shown developing Margaret and David's relationship other than some emotional bonding as a result of shared danger during a V2 rocket bombing. Then before you know it they're having an affair. Perhaps this contributes to my lack of interest in their romance. Frankly my heart does not bleed for Margaret much as I adore the actress portraying her. It was very unfair of her not warning David straight away that she's a married lady with a daughter thus I had more compassion for her misled lover.Later in the film the husband and lover are placed in a dangerous situation where they must cope with enemy action and rely upon each other. Naturally this makes for some 'interesting' scenes quite touchingly done as they must work together to survive. They're both fantastic here the macho younger Ford and the seasoned older Plummer. Their scenes are infinitely more compelling than those between the lovers in a relationship not very well drawn. No spoilers as to which gentleman prevails in the end. Do both or either of the two even survive the perils involved? Suffice it to say the ending was unforgettable for me personally.With these actors and this setting it might have been a great movie if they'd only imparted a little more depth and vulnerability to Margaret some relationship development and genuine chemistry to her affair with David and a bit more understanding as to why she succumbed to temptation in the first place. However in truth I confess that I'm a real sucker for a wartime romance and would lap up just about any representative of the genre especially one with this particular cast.".

There is a good balance of action and romance here decent character development. The pacing is a little slower than modern films but comparing an older film to modern drivel doesn't do much good. Sitting through this film should be a cake walk for people with an attention span.So over all a good film!Warning to Parents There is a very short amount of frontal nudity in this PG film.".

Ms. Down faces this issue.Overall an excellent discussion and depiction of this particular kind of dilemma.The movie begins in London with the American pilot alpha and the British nurse conning each other trying to fake each other out for a place on a bus.

Indeed Miss Downs is so irredeemably posh that I am not entirely convinced that Mr Ford does not classify as her bit of rough. She is a voluntary nurse  albeit one with an immaculate uniform and beautifully  coiffed hair.She walks the wards as a Lady Bountiful and I'm almost convinced the Sister refers to her as Lady Margaret at one stage. Her husband is in some hush  hush department running secret agents and they live in a very upmarket Townhouse somewhere around the Harley Street triangle.Their daughter little Miss P.Kensit is a cute poppet and everything in the marital garden appears lovely.Why she should risk all this for a quick tumble with a not particularly winning American bomber pilot is not clear.It certainly isn't for his conversation his monotonous tone of voice or his sense of humour. By contrast Mr C.Plummer is gentlearticulate and sensitive. In a ridiculously contrived plot twist he and Mr Ford end up in occupied France wearing German uniforms on a Deadly Mission. On their return Mr Ford nobly lets Miss Downs go back to her husband and is last seen loping across Hanover Square doubtless in pursuit of a fresh conquest. Women with husbands at the front in 1942 would not have been sympathetic towards herthe word Jezebel might well have been bandied freely about They knew all about temptation and resolutely resisted it if only for the sake of their men in foreign climes.The thought of a posh woman with a husband at home having it off with a Yank would have filled them with scorn.And quite rightly too.

It is more of a Barbara Cartland style romance than an action adventure movie.One interesting point is that former RAF USAAF airfield at Bovingdon was used for filming. It was previously used as the location for a number of air movies such as 633 SquadronMosquito Squadron and The War Lover. By the time Hanover Street started filming in 1978 it was disused and derelict so the aircraft were only filmed with very long lenses to avoid showing the background clearly.The film suffers from too many historical and technical errors to be taken seriously by WW2 buffs. For example there is a discussion about light  and heavy flak which makes it clear that writerdirector Peter Hyams thinks these terms refer to the number of guns employed whereas in fact they refer to the calibre of the weapons. For example a target defended by 100 x 20 mm guns is defended by light flak while a target defended by a single 88mm gun is defended by heavy flak.There is also a scene where the two heroes are pursued by a Hetzer tank destroyera vehicle whose only role is the destruction of enemy armour and would be singularly unsuited to the task of pursuing enemy agents.On the credit side John Barry delivers his usual excellent score.".

In this film the love is instant deeply romantic  yet torrid and lasting. Completely impossible! Having said all that the film still provides some great military movie sequences. There are some funny bits with Halloran and his copilot Cimino mouthing off during their missions and briefings. And a whole military caper pulled off by Halloran Ford and Mr. Sallinger Plummer which is both exciting and easy to follow.After a while one realizes that Margaret Sallinger Down never speaks her lines she whispers them in a plaintive teary voice always on the verge of boohoo. This becomes grating after a while. Further it makes the audience wonder what Halloran sees in her.Well the answer to what the attraction is never comes but the noble dialogue at the end is a struggle to listen to and is a riff on the immortal Casablanca Hill of beansHere's lookin' at you farewell between Rick and Ilsa. It is well that this Hanover Street highroad signoff sequence comes last as it is the most indulgent in melodrama.

Ford is selected for this mission as punishment for his earlier cowardice and belligerence toward a superior officer.The mission goes badly and the two leads are the only survivors of the shot down aircraft.

Naturally when Plummer talks about his wife Ford realizes she's the same girl he's been seeing.After some action they escape and Ford sends Downe back to her husband. Bittersweet ending fade to black.Like I said the bones of the story make for a classic love triangle with plenty of WW2 action thrown in for good measure. There's a fair amount of innovation in the script as all 3 parties in the triangle are likable and either way it went there would be no happy ending. The mission is exciting too.The problem is the script itself. The dialogue tends to be bad and that hurts the film badly. A few cliches don't help either look for the Catch 22 inspired characters in Ford's plane.Personally I feel that this film could have been one of the all time greats if only a little more work had gone into a script polish.

	schema:reviewBody "A soldier is put into the position of accompanying his lover's husband on a dangerous mission in Hanover Street starting Harrison Ford and LesleyAnne Down. This film was done at the beginning of Harrison Ford's career as a star and the results are disappointing. It plays more as a madeforTV movie especially with the casting of some actors mainly known for television work including Down and Richard Masur.The object it seems was to recreate the '40s World War II film and in this it is partially successful. There are some exciting scenes particularly toward the end. However the film takes about an hour to get going and in the slow first hour we don't get much back story. What for instance is the problem with Down's marriage to Christopher Plummer? I know there's a war on but Down and Ford seem to fall for one another immediately and we really don't get to see the love story develop. Before we know it there are lines like I don't know where you leave off and I begin. LesleyAnne Down in my opinion is one of the most beautiful women ever on TV or film  those eyes her coloring  she's gorgeous. She's not particularly made up or photographed to advantage in this but she's still amazing. Her acting is very good particularly in scenes with her daughter. Christopher Plummer as a man who feels he's not exciting enough for his wife is its usual excellent self in a part that isn't really fleshed out. He and Ford do an excellent job in their scenes together. Harrison Ford is Harrison Ford his star persona established early on  he's very natural jaunty and macho. His casting is perfection  a true movie star in the fashion of Hollywood's golden era in an oldfashioned romance. I just wish the movie had been better. And by the way the last action scene in the film is ridiculous.".

This film was done at the beginning of Harrison Ford's career as a star and the results are disappointing. It plays more as a madeforTV movie especially with the casting of some actors mainly known for television work including Down and Richard Masur.The object it seems was to recreate the '40s World War II film and in this it is partially successful.

	schema:reviewBody "This film has very little going for it other than the participation of Plummer and Ford. I honestly wanted to like it given my respect for Hyams and many of the actors but this just fell flat in so many ways.First LesleyAnn Down has she ever managed to be the romantic lead in a WWII picture that didn't end up being a piece of madeforTV garbage? I say this after having tried to watch her in 'Arch of Triumph' 1985 with Anthony Hopkins a remake of a project with 'Casablanca'level ambitions that simply fell flat this remake hardly improved upon the 1948 version. In 'Hanover Street' Ms. Downs' performance certainly wasn't enhanced by the flat dialogue and her wholly unsympathetic character. The woman is cheating on her husband plain and simple without explanation or cause. A stronger actress would have demanded a better backstory for this character some 'Sophie's Choice' or 'Plenty' content to make her more fathomable but this roundheeled wife of a British Intelligence officer Plummer is nothing but a liability. If she was able to be 'pickedup' by Ford as easily as she does in this film her character would have been victimized by a German Agent long before she encountered Ford. This film tries hard to be a romantic somethingorother but this woman's got a kid and no obvious conflicts of interest with husband Plummer. That's one raspberry right there.As for the schizophrenic element about 23rds the way through Hyams tries to turn this thing into a War film  Ford and Plummer go behind enemy lines together into Vichy France but the plotting is sloppy as they are thrown together by chance. Hyams spent some small amount of time setting Plummer up as some sort of spychief training other British Officers to to operate behind enemy lines and Ford is to be the Allied pilot that flies them to their destination. Fortunately unfortunately in these scenes Ford and Plummer share the strongest moments in the entire film and the two male leads have more chemistry with one another than either has with Ms. Downer.After doing all this spystuff exposition Hyams promptly kills off all of the Germanspeaking British Agents and saddles Plummer with an untrained monolingual Ford to complete a highly specialized intelligence heist in Central France. Plummer parachutes in with a German uniform Ford with his Hogan's Heroes flight jacket... as if he wouldn't stick out like a sore thumb once he hit the ground.It's truly no surprise that this film laid an egg at the box office  it is entirely uneven in terms of both script and story. If you want to see Ford in a better warmovie see 'Force 10 from Navarone'  better yet go straight to the top and see his cameo appearance in 'Apocalypse Now'.As for this film I can't even begin to imagine the market influences that allowed this script to be greenlit. The Americans were making gritty urban dramas  'Coming Home' 1978 'Midnight Express' 1978 'The Deer Hunter' 1978 and the next year saw the release of 'Apocalypse Now' 1979'Being There' 1979 and 'Kramer vs. Kramer' 1979. I suppose this film had the potential of filling that warmspot that the British have for soapoperas and patriotic warstories. While 'Hanover Street' may have had some promise as a script it really just falls rather flat in it's execution. Ford in a pilot's uniform is simply not enough to save this turkey of a film.".

At least give the guy a hammer and a boxful of nails and point him towards a pile of 2x4's. I don't want to rag on the movie too hard because lots of behindthescenes people made a living wage off it but jeez everything about Ford sank this film. Even his haircut was more Beverly Hills 1979 than WW2 London. The movie doesn't age well but then it wasn't any good back in '79 either.

	schema:reviewBody "I purchased the DVD because it had B25s in it one of my favorite aircraft. I knew there was a love story attached but it had Harrison Ford. Wow where was the adult supervision when creating the screenplay?The audience was never informed of the location of the film title 'Hanover Street'. I suppose that this was the London street where the two lovers first met although this was never made clear.I remember liking LeslieAnne Down Margaret Sellinger from her appearance in the 'North and South' miniseries. I was surprised she was willing to take off her top to get into this film. She was so weepy and whiny in this appearance. The script made her the helpless slave of her hormones. She seems to be able to get free of her family responsibilities every other Thursday to meet her lover. Then she goes home to be the perfect wife and mother for her young daughter.It would have been very dangerous for Margaret to continue these meetings the chance of being spotted during one of these trysts would have been great. She could have provided a perfect opening for blackmail by the Gestapo. No doubt her husband's position in intelligence would make the Sellinger family the object of intense observation. Margaret could have destroyed her whole family this way.Then there is the plot element where the identity of British double agents is kept in a safe at Gestapo Headquarters in Lyon France. How are the British privy to such information? How credible is it? What better opportunity for a coup by the Gestapo could there be? The Gestapo arranges for the British to gain access to a list of effective British Intelligence Agents they wish to destroy. These men are arrested and possibly executed by their own government. A few expendable lowlevel operatives are placed on the list to enhance credibility. British Intelligence is devastated even more when the Gestapo ensures that the British find out that they were duped into destroying their own loyal agents.Then there is the problem of British Intelligence Agents being caught and found dead. They would not have been found at all. They would have been wrung dry of all useful information and kept in secret confinement or more likely secretly executed and buried. The British would be kept in the dark about the fate of their agents to prevent them from learning from the mistakes that led to their men being caught. Uncertainty is a formidable weapon in an intelligence war.Then there is the Harrison Ford character 'David Halloran'. He is hardly blameless in having an affair with a married woman. He pulls off her left glove to reveal a wedding ring at their first meeting. That deters him from pursuing his passion not at all. It was kind of gross to watch their love scenes with her wedding ring still on her finger. He hardly needed to focus on this woman since plenty of eligible young women were hanging around the club on his airbase. He could see local women much more frequently than the forbidden flame in distant London.The film shifts gears into a fairly conventional war film about halfway through. We are treated to scenes where David's bomber is hit by enemy fire so severe that all his crew are killed yet it is still in condition to fly along for several minutes while he crawls about inside inspecting damage and holding a conversation with his passenger. The two survivors then parachute into a wooded area just before their aircraft explodes. The secret agent in full German uniform never the less carries about a miniature photograph of his wife secure in the knowledge that the Germans are too stupid to notice it.The two men parachute at night into the trees and drop to the ground under conditions that are strangely well illuminated for a woods at night. They then make no attempt to conceal their parachutes and stroll about calmly making small talk about matters of small importance to their survival or completion of the mission. The Germans strangely make no attempt to determine if any crew of the downed plane are still wandering about free on the ground. No wonder they lost the war!I could go on but there is not much fun to be had flogging this pitiful plot. Harrison Ford learned from this film and probably demanded to read the scripts before signing on to future projects. He was big enough at the box office to make his demands stick. He did manage to prevent type casting from the 'Star Wars' films and so the film had to go into the win column for Ford's career. Just look at the pitiful careers of Carrie Fisher and Mark Hammill post 'Star Wars'.".

	schema:reviewBody "Still relatively new to the scene Harrison Ford takes the romantic leading role for this remarkably oldfashioned wartime soap opera. For much of the film Ford looks plainly ill at ease not all all suited to the slushy love story in which he is participating. Similarly the director action specialist Peter Hyams finds the romantic aspects that dominate the first half of his film difficult to deal with. Instead of creating a convincing onscreen love story Hyams overdoes things almost to the point of self parody asking grand gestures of his actors and an absurdly overbearing score of composer John Barry. At the hour mark there won't be many viewers left with the willpower to remain tuned in. But just as the film threatens to collapse completely Hyams who also wrote the film suddenly shifts his narrative to something that he and Ford are much better at. The second half of Hanover Street redeems the film as it drops the mockromantic weepie approach and becomes an engaging escape melodrama.American bomber pilot David Halloran Harrison Ford is stationed in England during World War 2. One day during an air raid he meets a beautiful nurse Margaret Sellinger Lesley Anne Down and the pair of them are instantly attracted to each other. Margaret is already married but her relationship with husband Paul Christopher Plummer lacks passion and excitement. She is therefore swept hopelessly off her feet by her romantic encounter. Halloran's devilmaycare attitude towards his dangerous occupation begins to soften now that he has something to live for but he is still chosen to fly a British spy over enemy lines as part of a dangerous parachute drop. By the most incredible chance the spy turns out to be Paul taking on an audacious raid behind enemy lines in a bold gesture to win back the respect of his wife. When the plane is hit by enemy fire Halloran and Paul are forced to bail out together deep in enemy country. In an ironic twist of fate the unwitting love rivals become survival buddies both relying upon the other to get out of the perilous predicament they are in. They have many adventures as they attempt to steal a document from the Gestapo HQ in Lyon and make it back alive to the woman they love.This is the only wartime film Hyams has made and in the later stages he demonstrates a proficiency for the genre that makes one rue his decision to make the film in the mould of a tearjerker. If he had just gone for a fullon wartime thriller  something along the lines of Where Eagles Dare  he might have made a rather good film. Alas the soppy opening hour cannot be erased from the memory nor can it be forgiven and it really does cheapen the whole effect of the film. Down performs quite well under the circumstances trying hard and with moderate success to make her love dilemma involving even though the script defeats her with overwroughtness. But she is the only one who seems to give a damn during the first half  Ford looks totally desperate throughout this section and Hyams simply lacks the finesse to make it work. Even Plummer cannot do much during the opening hour his role reduced to that of a boring cuckold with a handful of scenes in which to make his mark. One thing that does work nicely throughout the entire film is the photography by David Watkin which captures the desired period feel rather accurately. To summarise Hanover Street is shamelessly oldfashioned tosh in which the action bits are handled with infinite more conviction than the romantic ones.".

And Harrison really knows how to hold a woman in his arms fellows take note!. The music by the great John Barry also composed the music for Out Of Africa Sophie's Choice and Born Free among many others is marvelous very evocative of the era and helps the movie a great deal. But if you've one of the classic romance movies like Casablanca or the Vivien Leigh version of Waterloo Bridge this one pales in comparison. Compared to what passes for romance in films these days though this one's fine. SPOILERADULT CONTENT WARNING There's a topless scene and some bad language. But Hanover Street is worth a couple of hours of cable TV on a rainy afternoon.".

	schema:headline " Some nice scenes carry a weak WWII film";
	schema:reviewBody "More romance war movies were made about American GIs in England than in all other countries combined. And it's no wonder since Great Britain was the marshaling area for the largest invasion force in history. It was the headquarters of the Allied European command during World War II. It was the home of more U.S. Army Air Force bases than all other locations combined. And by the end of the war some two million Americans had been in England. So of course there would be many romances between GIs and British women. At the end of the war the U.S. Army transported some 70000 British war brides to America. The clichs aside some Brits especially men took to seeing the Yanks as overpaid oversexed and over here while some Americans had a comeback that the Brits were underpaid undersexed and under Eisenhower there were many matches that ended in marriage. Others ended unhappily when the GIs died in battle. But the largest number most likely were romances that ended in time. There probably were some that involved infidelity and adultery such as in this movie. And most of those likely resolved in the end. A line at the very end of this film summarizes the plight of all of the various war time romances nicely. Harrison Ford playing David Halloran says Things work out the way they're supposed to. Perhaps some people would see this as a real love story between two people  Halloran and Margaret Sellinger played by LesleyAnne Down. In my younger years I might have. But age and experience bring insights that enable us to see beyond idealistic longings emotions and the strong hormonal drives of younger years. I think this film shows a little bit the struggle the married Margaret has over their affair. David admits his struggle especially after having been on a mission with her husband Paul played by Christopher Plummer. Whether or not theirs was truly love or just a strong romance brought on by the time and circumstances the movie ending appropriately says that life will go on and they will be OK. Because of the variety of scenes  the city streets of London the bombing of the city the B25s at the airfield and the bombing runs made by the Americans I think this film has some historical value. But the script otherwise is thin. The mission that David and Paul are on almost seems stagy at times. Plummer does a very good job in his role  I think the best of the film. But otherwise this isn't a very dynamic script. Two aspects of Hanover Street bothered me. Having seen films such as Twelve O'Clock High that so well depict the strain and stress that the pilots and their commanders had I found the flippancy of Ford's character in the mission briefings not very real or believable. His disrespect for his CO just doesn't gel well. C'mon! This guy is an officer in the Army Air Force not one of the social outcasts picked for a mission in The Dirty Dozen. Other films show very well the anguish that commanders suffered for the lives of the men who didn't return from missions. That whole part of this film didn't seem real. And with that I very soon had enough of Richard Masur's constantly complaining character 2nd Lieutenant Jerry Cimino. Another 1979 film about romance by American GIs in England came out later that year. Yanks starred Richard Gere but had a much larger cast and a very engrossing plot. It is about three different romances each one of a different type and result. It's a very good look at the British people during the war. The romances and loves are treated more realistically and deeply in that film. And one of the old war romances is the 1940 film Waterloo Bridge that stars Robert Taylor and Vivien Leigh. That one involved adultery on the part of the American in another love triangle. It too resolved in the end with a believable outcome.".

As for LesleyAnn Down her bad acting is porn movie level at least they don't pretend in porn movies. The action is full of dumb Germans and an inventive American that outwits them all. The English Plummer is wounded and helpless but at least Plummer as always saves the day. I do not recommend this movie to children cuz it distorts the real atmosphere of WWII and thus history. I do not recommend this to couples unless you're a guy trying to impress a brainless female date.And if you are an adult and you happen to like this you are probably the kind of person that keep Disney Land from bankrupcy and make Pearl Harbour and Top Gun type of productions in the top of the boxoffice.

	schema:reviewBody "The Land Before Time IV Journey Through the Mists the fourth installment into the Land Before Time series. I've been watching the sequels in the Land Before Time series because I'm curious about them I loved the first Land Before Time and despite the sequels not having the best reputation I still wanted to see what they were about. So far I really did enjoy the second movie the third was decent and now Journey Through the Mists is pretty good. I think it's just as good as the third one there's nothing that really stands out about it but it still has a very good message about friendship and learning how to make new friends. It's very good for the kids to watch and I'm sure even some of the adults can get into this series as well for some light hearted fun.Littlefoot notices a longneck herd entering the Great Valley and informs his grandparents. They tell him that the longnecks are their cousins and that they must go and greet them. As the Old One the leader of the herd tells the residents of the Great Valley that her herd has been migratory since a heavy rain period turned their old home into a marshland called The Land of Mists and became the home of many dangerous creatures Littlefoot meets a longneck girl named Ali and invites her to play. He introduces her to his friends but as she is not used to associating with diverse species she is afraid of them. Grandpa Longneck falls ill and the Old One notes that the illness is lethal unless the victim eats the petals of the Night Flower a flower which can only be found in the Land of Mists. Though Littlefoot is warned that the journey is too dangerous he feels determined to save his grandfather and asks Ali to take him there. She agrees as the two of them make their way they pass through a cave and sudden earthquake causes a wall of rocks to crash down separating them. Ali decides the others will have to help her free Littlefoot and runs off to get them. Littlefoot in the meantime tries to find a way out and meets Archie who offers to help him dig through the rocks. They are interrupted by a belly dragger and a sharp beak named Dil and Ichy who have their minds set to eat them. But Littlefoot's friends are not too far behind as they help Littlefoot and Ali. Together they continue the journey to help save Littlefoot's grandfather.The Land Before Time IV Journey Through the Mists is a good animated film that I'm sure if you have an open mind you'll enjoy it. There is so much dislike for these films I think it's not just the songs but everyone is so determined that the first was the best and can't accept that there is a newer generation who wants to see new stories with Littlefoot and his friends. Over all I'm enjoying the series even if it is a little cheesy so far there hasn't been anything to hate. The fourth installment is a good one so I'm excited for the 5th movie and I'll give you an honest review of that movie as well.510".

For people who find LBT5 etc too babyish you will probably like this one quite a lot as well.As for the actual film it has the same sort of companionship and teamwork as the first the second and the third LBT's and you could even say this is less babyish than LBT2. The animation is quite well done especially the backgrounds. The music is one of the highlights not repeating and constantly gloomy or happy unlike in some of the other LBT's. The storyline is both exciting and tedious in places but there is a good adventure. The old characters are pretty much the same which is good unfortunately the new character a longneck called Ali is pretty much a spoilt silly character but luckily improves as the story goes along. The songs are pretty good for a LBT especially It Takes All Sorts and Grandma's Lullaby. That's pretty much it in highlights and disadvantages... Oh yes  the baddies are a bit silly but scary enough to entertain people who like very bad villains the the LBTs.What happens is that outside the valley the weather and pretty much everything else is changing  for the worse. Meanwhile a wandering herd meet Littlefoot's grandparents and Littlefoot's grandpa becomes very sick. Along with Littlefoot's new friend Ali he is determined to find the nightflower in the mysterious beyond which may be able to cure his grandpa...Enjoy Land Before Time IV Journey Through the Mists.".

When Grandpa Longneck gets sick the others have to get Ali to lead them to the Night Flower which only grows in the Land of Mists. As for the new characters Ali is very sweet and has such a nice voice Archie has some funny moments and Tickles is nearly as cute as Chomper. I also have to disagree with some of the other reviews and say that Dill and Icky while not the most menacing are pretty funny. I personally found the songs to be an improvement over those from the previous two installments with Eggs being the only real standout from those two. Grandma's Lullaby is rather sweet and calming Who Needs You is pretty catchy and funny and It Takes All Sorts is simply adorable and I love its message. Finally the animation is simply gorgeous especially on the flowers which have such a beautiful golden glow that wonderfully contrasts with the foggy background.

Ali is sweet and I kind of ship her with Littlefoot even though I prefer him with Cera and the villains are just downright hilarious. Not to mention that this movie introduces the adventure aspect of The Land Before Time that persisted throughout most of the later and arguably better sequels in the franchise. I'll admit that the parents were kind of stupid in this movie but really that's a problem with movies 27. I also really like the songs in this movie. The first song is a very soothing melody the villain song is one of my ultimate guilty pleasure songs and the last song is kind of cute.".

The animation in this movie is still pretty good except a little better. The animation on the night flowers is really flippin' good! I also really like the new characters. Ali is sweet and I kind of ship her with Littlefoot even though I prefer him with Cera and the villains are just downright hilarious. Not to mention that this movie introduces the adventure aspect of The Land Before Time that persisted throughout most of the later and arguably better sequels in the franchise. I'll admit that the parents were kind of stupid in this movie but really that's a problem with movies 27. I also really like the songs in this movie. The first song is a very soothing melody the villain song is one of my ultimate guilty pleasure songs and the last song is kind of cute.";

	schema:headline " The Most Artistic Entry In The Series";
	schema:reviewBody "The truth is the 2nd and 3rd movies sucked and that scared off critics. They thought if they liked or heck even watched the 4th one people would think they were crazy. And that's a real shame because well the 4th one is good! REALLY good!Journey Through The Mists just has so many strong points. For a start it doesn't have that tedious feeling some other entries in the series have  no moment of screen time really seems pointless or wasted except maybe the villain song and the pacing is well thoughtout not so fast it feels unnatural but no so slow you start getting bored.On top of that there's the overall ideas behind the movie. Most of the films in the series are rather frivolous you know from the very start everything will be the same at the end of the episode as it was at the beginning  but Journey Through The Mists is different. The first obvious thing is Littlefoot's grandpa becoming sick  it feels like he actually IS in danger it's not just another run of the mill quest into the Mysterious Beyond it feels different this time. Even more so than grandpa's illness the story of the Valley of the Mists is absolutely brilliant! The series spends 90 of its time focusing on getting into the Great Valley getting out of the Great Valley or chillaxing in the Great Valley  and now suddenly we're thrown into this awesome new location with its own history and it's own dinosaurs. COOL! Not only that but it has this really unsettling feeling about it the location has this bright and cute charm yet there is danger and suspense behind every corner. The real genius of the Valley of the Mists though is how it impacts our view of the Great Valley. The traveling longneck's ambiguous response about whether the Great Valley's climate will change too leaves the audience genuinely unsettled and wondering if the valley really is as permanent as it seems. It would've been great to see this plot thread continue throughout the series actually with the climate changes approaching the valley and some big climax where Littlefoot and friends found a way to save it but alas that wasn't so.So that's the pacing and the ideas  what else does this movie have going for it? Characters. Sure many movies in the series have great guest characters  Chomper Mo and Bron for example. But this one just has SO MANY and apart from the irritating villains they're all pulled off really well. Archie is just this fun old man he's just generally likable and to see how brave he is as practically a defenseless 80 year old protecting a child he's only just met only reinforces that. Tickles is another character who again is just plain likable. His introduction is pulled off really well the main cast are in a spooky swamp they sense something and feel they're under attack then the fog clears and they find themselves face to face with this adorable bright happy creature in a world full of darkness. And even though he only has a minor side role Tickles continues to be fun every second he's on screen. Cute animal sidekicks are easy to stuff up but the writers and animators didn't stuff up at all.Then there's the biggest new character introduction  Ali. The thing that sets Ali apart from most characters in the series is her flaws. Don't take this the wrong way she is still superlikable but the way she's shy and distrusting of those who are different and her eventual character reformation it makes her seem so much more realistic.Before wrapping this up there is ONE more praiseworthy thing about this movie  the animation. The absolutely beautiful handdrawn animation makes this movie. The cinematic and scenic backgrounds the cute character designs the sense of magic and mystery created by the mists colours and 'glowy' lighting. It gets across the parts of the story that just can't be told through words alone the true hallmark of a great film.So there you go Journey Through The Mists easily the best entry in the Land Before Time franchise. In fact contrary to what most critics believe there are a lot of hidden gems in the series especially episodes 8 9 and 10. They just get ignored because people are so put off by all the filler in between.".

As far as the sequels go some are good and some are bad. The best ones for me have been Great Valley Adventure and Time of the Great Giving. This one wasn't bad but it isn't great. Starting with the good the animation is mostly very nice not the same visual style as the original but it is colourful. The rainbow waterfall shot was beautiful. There is also a nice message about friendship and sticking together. The main characters are likable enough with the exception of Cera Littlefoot is less bossy here and Ducky still is funny and cute. Ali is a nice addition too. And Spike spoke that was a great moment! The plot is a nice idea and moves along fairly quickly and the voice acting of Scott McAfee Heather Hogan Linda Gary and Kenneth Mars was excellent. And it was a big bonus hearing that beautiful poignant main theme from the original and in general the incidental music was lovely. However this is where the bad comes in. I didn't care for the songs I just found them forgettable but maybe it is just me. I didn't like Cera very much here I know people who complain that Cera was never a likable character to begin with maybe so but I found her particularly bratty here. My main problem were with the villains here despite the voicing of Tress MacNeille and Jeff Bennett two extremely talented voice actors I found Dil and Ichy lame and unthreatening. In general the dialogue with the villains primarily was uninspiring. My next gripe is with the sequels in general this film and most of the other sequels are too short you never quite feel the depth and the emotional attachment that was there in the original no matter how hard the makers try. Overall this isn't bad but it isn't all that great. 510 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "Inside Job is an enthralling documentary about how the reckless actions of Wall Street lead to the near collapse of the financial sector and subsequently the deepest recession since the 1930s. This is the second film by director Charles Ferguson the first being No End in Sight an equally engaging indictment of the Bush Administration's handling of the occupation of Iraq. Ferguson focuses on the Wall Street culture and the blatant arrogance of a half dozen men as the main causes of the financial turmoil. Inside Job begins in Iceland where the deregulation of the financial system in the 1990s lead to three banks accumulating assets almost ten times the small country's gross domestic product.It becomes clear by the midpoint of the film that Iceland is a micro example of what has become a global problem. Runaway banks have been accumulating assets through toxic loans and other manoeuvres while paying themselves lavish bonuses. Inside Job is easily one of the most frustrating documentaries ever made. And that is undoubtedly Ferguson's intention. The film is critical of Wall Street executives credit agencies and especially regulatory agencies for the crisis.Inside Job includes interviews from IMF head Dominique StraussKhan congressmen Barney Frank former New York attorney general Eliot Spitzer and many others. Ferguson traces the evolution of the banks from a small largely local service to an out of control industry. He does not hold back criticizing every administration since Ronald Reagan in the 1980s.Ferguson argues that despite what most people think there were many people warning of an impending crisis in global financial markets. Ben Bernanke Alan Greenspan and Timothy Geithner ignored various signs of impending doom. Not to mention former treasury secretary and incidentally former Goldman Sachs CEO Henry Paulson.Inside Job makes the argument that the federal regulators are as responsible for the breakdown of the system as are the executives of Goldman Sachs Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns. More frustrating still is the revolving door between Wall Street and government agencies.As the banks became more deregulated the more speculation became a problem. Derivatives and credit default swaps complicated trading schemes that most people do not understand is what caused the collapse of Lehman Brothers sending shockwaves through financial centres all over the world.Credit agencies like Moody's and Standard and Poor gave firms like Bear Stearns Lehman brothers and Morgan Stanley A grade credit ratings within weeks before they nearly collapsed. And also having one of their executives standing up in front of a congressional committee and telling congressmen that their ratings are just merely 'opinion'.It becomes clear that this is not a problem that emerged from the housing boom early in president George W. Bush's second term. Rather this was a systematic breakdown driven by a neoliberal ideology supported by Ivey league economic schools across the United States.Inside Job is simply a story of bankers more interested in collecting bonuses and making more money than providing what should be an essential service. What makes it even more frustrating is that many of the key figures behind the crisis are currently on Barak Obama's staff. The film leaves us with a bitter pill to swallow.As Ferguson notes Wall Street has returned to normal with no federal prosecutions against any of the guilty. And one of the most poignant scenes in the film comes from Robert Gnaizda the former head of the Greenlining Institute a consumer lobbyist group who laughingly dismisses recent legislation to regulate banks with a simple 'Hah'.Inside Job helps explain many of the complex terms such as derivatives and insurance backed securities that confuse those not immersed in the banking community. It is essential viewing for any citizen concerned about our broken system.".

	schema:reviewBody "I work. I have worked since I was 16. I worked when going to college. I worked between college. I worked after college. I worked while raising a family. I worked sometimes 3 or 4 jobs at a time. I'm still working. And after retirement I don't think I would be able to quit doing something even if it meant being a greeter at Wells Fargo. I put in my overtime. I put in my dues. I will not really have enough money to live on when I retire but that is all relative to my lifestyle at that time. I certainly will not be able to afford the house but I will have some foreseeable comforts. I may not have worked as hard as others but I have worked dependably and consistently. My conscience is fairly clean.I have never been in a position to make vast amounts of money. Most of my life I have lived from paycheck to paycheck. I am not a financial planner. I can be an impulsive buyer at times but when I get that craving I make sure that whatever I get will last me. I'm probably the perfect Joe Schmoe.I watched this film. I don't know why.

The movie then proceeds to tactfully follow the events from the Regan era deregulation to the panic of the collapse of insurance banks and brokerage houses.

The directors are quick to point out those individuals that did not let an interview happen casting a higher level of doubt to their credibility. All in all much was exposed and even if 30 of it is true it is disappointing it ever got to this point.Unlike Moore seeing this was a serious piece I appreciated the fact the production wasn't degraded by any comic relief. There was much to love and hate about this film. The production of it was crisp clean and too the point following a well thought out introduction and ending but you sure do end up hating capitalism by the time the ending credits start to roll.".

I worked sometimes 3 or 4 jobs at a time. I'm still working. And after retirement I don't think I would be able to quit doing something even if it meant being a greeter at Wells Fargo. I put in my overtime. I put in my dues. I will not really have enough money to live on when I retire but that is all relative to my lifestyle at that time. I certainly will not be able to afford the house but I will have some foreseeable comforts. I may not have worked as hard as others but I have worked dependably and consistently. My conscience is fairly clean.I have never been in a position to make vast amounts of money. Most of my life I have lived from paycheck to paycheck. I am not a financial planner. I can be an impulsive buyer at times but when I get that craving I make sure that whatever I get will last me. I'm probably the perfect Joe Schmoe.I watched this film. I don't know why.

	schema:reviewBody "It was the last thing I wanted to see as the holiday Season sets off A documentary explaining the World wide economic depression. But it was probably something I should have put before say Burlesque. This is a serious film that has no particular political axe to grind in terms of Republican vs. Democrat since each successive administration beginning with Ronald Reagan is thrashed for bowing down to Wall Street rather than protecting American citizens from the most immoral graft and greed that I can remember in my 60 years as a U.S. Citizen. While it's true that deregulation is the hue and cry of one particular political party what occurs with investment and banking firms is so entwined with our national representatives that it does no good whatsoever to point fingers at one party.The film opens with the simplest explanation of the impact of investment banking firms in the tiny country of Iceland. When investors move in and create a financial bubble for the sole purpose of letting it burst while taking off with enormous profits for themselves the opening credits then start and introduce us to the players who would come to power with Reagan Volker and Greenspan and remove restrictions that had been put in placewe should all remember for good reason regulations were set up because people had abused an open marketwe see the rise and fall of the U.S. economy which became based on nothing but investment since all our production had been poorly managed and sent abroad i.e. steel automobiles etc. What was left was goods and services and a tiny though prosperous information technology. When Reagan gutted regulation and regulatory agencies a system of credit developed where finance agencies sold risky loans to entities and at the same time bet on those loans to fail setting up a situation that the more risky the loan the bigger the profit for lender. Various talking heads and bar graphs come across the screen and they're all helpful in explaining what happened. But it's the deeply amoral points of view that get stated by people who were or are still in control of the financial banks and markets of this country that really appall.And we're left with a sense of outrage and not more than a little sense of futility because there's nowhere to go for either compensation or redress. At the end of the film Fair Game about another kind of government takeover we're given a civic's speech about how the country belongs to the people and it's up to us to make it work. Here in Inside Job there's nothing anyone can do. We elected a president who was sent to prevent the problem from happening again but instead he appoints many of the same people who set up the situation and profited from the first round.I didn't find the small section of the film describing the type A personality of the players involved who use prostitutes and drugs to be either relevant or convincing. We see a former call girl allude to many in the financial world but so what? There's a small dig at Elliot Spitzer but he offers it himself. As well we're given a psychiatrist who can't reveal names but can say for certain many in the financial industry are addicted to drugs and prostitutes but so are many outside that world. It came across as a cheap shot in a film that brings forward many significant players and names many who refused to appear in the film and exposes them for what they are. They need no further tarnishing.I did see one area that could be addressed as a beginning of reform. Various economic professors who are brought from institutions of higher learning to advise the government and then return to their teaching jobs aren'tfor baffling reasonsprohibited from making profit off the policies they recommend. That needs to be stopped. In most disciplines university professors can't use their research and publications for personal gain. Those in the field of economics need the same kinds of restrictions. And students should demand it.We should all demand a lot more than we're getting from our government but I guess we hope we're going to be one of the few to reap those enormous profits which is a real sucker's bet. It's baffling and infuriating to watch this film and walk out into the light of day where the practices on display are still going on.".

This film delivers in both counts.For me the key sequence came when the graphics under solid narration illustrated how 3rd tier investors were placing bets on bets. I.e. that's what derivatives are. I always knew this was happening but the film made it very clear. That was the break point in my analysis of the problem.The film was nearly void of political leanings which made it an important contribution. The only part that bothered me is that Congressman Barney Frank was framed as an expert looking back with wisdom on the illconceived passage of the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 and behold! Barney Frank voted for it. It would be better to interview all 4 Congressmen who voted against it Ron Paul Nick Smith Gene Taylor and Peter DeFazio. 2 from each Party! How's that for Bipartism opposition? It took me 10 minutes to confirm these names and I'm not even making a movie. It is significant that a continuum of hoodlums are seen on the podium with a continuum of Prsidents Regan through Obama. The infestation of their ilk into the Political World is there for all to see.Please see this film any way you can and lock it in!".

	schema:headline " a few small flaws";
	schema:reviewBody "I still believe the best movie on the crisis is 'The Other Guys'. But this is a close second.There are a few minor flaws though.The most glaring is the softpedal of Barney Frank who had pushed Fannie and Freddie to go into subprime and was mysteriously uninquisitive of Countrywide during the crisis. An other issue is the scenes with hedge fund manager Bill Ackman. He has great insight in the film but his major contribution during the crisis was his outspoken criticism against MBIA an insurance company that he was also shorting. IE when MBIA faltered due to CDOs it 'insured' Ackman made lots of money. This is told by Christine S Richard in the book Confidence Game. As in 'The Big Short' by Michael Lewis even the 'whistleblowers' themselves had conflicts of interest. None of this is anywhere in the film. Another problem is that the film never distinguishes between Synthetic CDOs and 'Cash' CDOs. The Synthetics were basically a form of gambling as they were not made of any real asset just credit default swaps. It's sort of a weird subject but it is kind of important because without the Synthetics the market thus the problem would have been much much smaller.The laudatory tone towards Europe is a little difficult to understand since Europe was up to it's ears in CDOs. And one 'wall street' firm up to its armpits in subprime Deutsche Bank is not even American. Europe had housing bubbles and banking bailouts and other problems as well coming to roost in 2010.The positive view of the Chinese banks is also odd since China was in CDOs and had a bank that almost merged with Bear Stearns. China's financial industry is about as pure and well regulated as their milk or toy paint industry. Also I laughed at the section about how in the US 'high tech sector' jobs were 'easy' to come by. Considering the place where I work uses software owned by a company in India and the number of underemployed computer people I know. But the film also has a lot of stuff I haven't seen in the books on the crisis most importantly the massive conflict of interest and corruption between academia government and business. Especially effective was how the interviewees on this subject didn't seem to 'get it'. The book EConned by Yves Smith describes the problems with the modern study of economics but Mr Ferguson draws us some extremely specific lines between men who worked high in government the conclusions found in their 'academic' writing and the industry that pays them for their 'outside consulting'. This is the most devastating part of the film to me.And the film does fantastically with the short time it's given. I would give my eye's teeth to see the full interviews. Gillian Tett gets under a minute of screen time but she has written an entire book about how Credit Default Swaps were invented by a handful of traders at JP Morgan and how the idea was 'perverted'. it's not really mentioned in her interview. The same could be said of many other authors interviewed.A nice Hollywood ending might have been discussing how the Swedes dealt with their banks but... its Charles Ferguson don't expect a Hollywood ending.".

His focus in this movie is also on the failure of power to prepare for what many could see was a nightmare in the making. Ferguson in this film traces the failure and in many cases the unwillingness of government academic and financial elites to make policy which ensures financial health for all. Ferguson made a lot of money as an Internet entrepreneur and can now make the film the way he wants and it's caught on by word of mouth by virtue of a little man named Oscar and probably by the zeitgeist.Ferguson tracks some of the key decisions which greased the rails for the meltdownfrom the GrammLeachBliley Act which destroyed the division between investment and savings banks to the destruction of the reputation of Brooksley Born who had desired to put derivatives under the regulation of the CFTC of which she was the head to the laissezfaire attitude of Alan Greenspan during his tenure as Fed chief. He interviews academics whose imprimatur and intellectual reputation were made available at a price. Ferguson also notes the popularity of cocaine and prostitutes on Wall Street at the time of this boom.Ferguson interviews some of the key movers and shakers. If they're unwilling to be interviewed for the film a message saying that that person declined to be interviewed appears on the screen. This is nearly more damning than if they do participate as it suggests they have something to hide. Ferguson doesn't suffer fools lightly and if he feels that an interviewee is not being straight with him he is not shy about noting this. This is to our benefit as viewers and ensures that we see who is responsible for what. The movie is paced well Ferguson is an intelligent detailoriented director and Matt Damon narrates the film quite ably.If you don't know what derivatives are this is a good film to fill you in in a substantive and adequate way on all the key points you need to know in order to understand the crisis. If you have followed the economics news closely this is an excellent summary of the crisis. This really should be required viewing for all in the US.".

This is a very important movie to watch. I think it's important that we all see how and why this could have happened if we want to prevent it from happening again.Before I get to the good parts I want to call out what I thought was missing from this documentary a strong objective on what me the viewer should do. What's the call to action? Should I be enraged and were I American call my house of representative to vent my frustration about the lack of and need for change? Perhaps. But I didn't feel that. That strong emotional reaction was missing. If that's important to you maybe it won't be a satisfying movie but regardless I still say this is on a VERY important topic and it's done VERY well that people should see this.What was good about it? 1 It explains the events and potential complex Financial concepts in a concise easytounderstand manner. The director has a PHD from MIT and it shows. The writing is intelligent the story tells with an economy of language and is well structured.2 It is logical comes across as factual paints various people in often uncompromising light to reveal a picture of Financial greed excess and lack of honesty in the US financial system. It shows why this picture is believable and makes a convincing argument that this greed excess and lack of honesty in the system will NOT change.3 Is it horrifying? No. Some people might paint a picture of the movie like that but for me it was reasonable in its claims. Sure it was hard on people and things. And it feels like a very complete and real world view to me pulling together all the tidbits I've readheard of into one conclusive thesis....which I LOVED.4 It did make me think what if I became employed in the industry in the early 2000s...would that have been a good thing or a bad thing? Interestingly it showed how doing so would and could have been very good for someone to do so become exceedingly and perhaps unfairly wealthy with very little accountability if things failed. Yes  we should ALL have done so if we could. Because so many people got away with it. Greed. Excess. The immoral crap doesn't exist. The system is flawed. So take advantage until the government does something. BUt they do not. Or did not and may not. The ugliness may not clean itself up. That's part of the message. And if you 5 So  what to do now? Take money out of the markets. Don't support these US institutions Investment bankslarge US financial institutions. That was the subtle message for me.AND  tell everyone about this movie. To watch it. To be warned that all is not well. And perhaps someone will do something say something or perhaps act a little more honestly to try to right the wrongs of this world.This movie was courageous. It gets my support.".

	schema:headline " Great Film";
	schema:reviewBody "Inside Job is a fascinating and enjoyable film. I have lived through various financial crises dating back to Long Term Capital Management's collapse in the mid1990s. With each succeeding market meltdown the culprits seem to get progressively greedier and the regulators look increasingly stupid. What is worrying is that business ethics seem to be a thing of the past. Dating back to the 1920s it seems that given complete freedom to speculate investors will act irresponsibly. Roosevelt concluded that tighter regulation was necessary to stop a repeat of the 1929 crash and he was probably right. Greenspan and his followers seem to have believed that people are smarter today and government intervention was no longer necessary. The film shows that markets can't be trusted to regulate themselves.In a recent PBS documentary there was a report Brooksley Born's attempt to regulate derivatives in the 1990s. Born was the chairperson of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and was stopped by a cabal consisting of Greenspan Summers and Rubin. Born received no support from Bill Clinton who appointed her. Her resignation is also mentioned in Inside Job. Before the crash Greenspan was considered by the press to be almost a wise Yodalike genius. His views carried the day but eventually his luck ran out. Things may have turned out differently had Born been listened to. Many of the academics interviewed in the film now look ridiculous for their support of big finance. In my experience academics don't really understand how markets work. They have very simplistic theories based around the idea that markets are rational and efficient. I just interviewed two recent MBA graduates from good schools and its amazing they are still being taught stuff I learned 30 years ago which I now know is seriously flawed. Various crashes have taught me that most academic theories in finance don't really survive in the real world. It's a case of the blind leading the blind. Greenspan admitted to Congress that his understanding of the way markets work may have been wrong. Howeveras the film reveals academics have often provided intellectual cover for the bankers and speculators. They are supposedly independent but they have become articulate and convincing cheerleaders for free markets. Unfortunately they have also become useful idiots. People tend to blame the Republican's for being too easy on big business but George Bush's initiated the Enron trials and Jeff Skilling their former CEO was sent to prison for 24 years. Bush also introduced the SarbannesOxley legislation. The shocking thing about Inside Job is that under Obama nobody on Wall Street was punished and the legislation he introduced has really changed nothing. He is clearly no Roosevelt. You got the impression from the film that both Obama and Clinton employed advisers that were too close to Wall Street. Hopefully after the next meltdown serious change will happen however don't bet on it.".

	schema:reviewBody "A few days after it won the Oscar I got to see this film and I can see why it won. Not only is it of its time but it goes after the villains of the day and does so in a way that is accessible without being dumbed down and is indignant without ever becoming the sort of bang the drum anger of Michael Moore. There were a couple of quotes that hit home with me what can we believe in? There is nothing we can trust anymore said one commentator on the feeling of the public when the collapses started and in regards the aftermath of it all another said simply the poorest as always pay the most. These two quotes stayed with me because this film is the type of one that will make you angry  angry at injustice angry at how it could have been allowed to happen and angry that rules that apply to you and I somehow don't apply to those with money and power.However I didn't feel angry and the reason I didn't is because the film is much better put together than that. Anger comes from emotion and I don't always like it when a documentary starts pulling emotional strings on me. Mostly Inside Job lets the facts speak for themselves and in doing so it left me quite incredulous so quite amazed at the scale of things that I couldn't get worked up  it was more a matter of shock. The saying is safety in numbers and Inside Job very quickly lets us in on why that title was chosen  because there appears to be nobody here who is guilt free. While many of the players understandably refused to be interviewed for this film Ferguson does make the most of the access he does get and uses these interviews to illustrate key things as the narrator Matt Damon unfolds events along the timelines.So we of course get interviews that fill in the details but more tellingly we get people who unwittingly demonstrate the sort of apathy and selfinterest that contributed towards the global crisis. Politics is in the target of course because the names just all seem to change seats every few years and although one would love to believe that someone coming into politics can cut these conflict of interests the film shows literally millions of reasons why this is not a realistic thing to expect. The film also adds a new target to the mix by looking at the relationship between the banks and funds and academia. Knowledgeable professors and the like are put on the spot and it is hard not to enjoy it while they squirm get shifty shirty or just plain look uncomfortable. I'm not sure if my favourite is the guy paid by Iceland to right a study on their economy conclusion? It's awesome! when it is pointed out that the title Financial Stability in Iceland is retrospectively titled Instability when it comes to his CV listing or the guy who denies any conflict of interest with people being paid by the organisations they are writing independent studies or when he is asked a hypothetical about medical research  pharmaceutical companies and has to wrestle himself to avoid the phrase conflict of interest in his answer.The footage behind and around the contributions themselves well shot is engaging as well and the film does look good. The editing down and use of all the footage is impressive  it makes its point keeps things punchy without feeling like people are being cut off and only once or twice did I feel that the answers or statements were being perhaps a little unfairly edited. Despite this though all of it is engaging enthralling and rather sickening. Those hoping for a happy ending should be praised for their naivety but warned of watching this because this is an inside job  the poor will lose what little they have and the middle majority will continue to look up to those in charge telling us about change and reform while acquiring a greater and greater percentage of the world's wealth.A very well put together documentary that engaged me to the point that I almost forgot how incredibly depressing it all is.".

Inside Job is definitely longer more methodical and less melodramatic than Exit. It dealt with a more serious and internationally significant subject matter the global financial crisis. Yes this film was really better than Exit and fully deserves its Oscar. Although Exit undoubtedly did have more sense of humor.The film starts from how the crisis began in the Reagan years to the building up and eventual bursting of the financial bubble of the late 2000s. This was because of governmental deregulation of financial institutions that involved banks ratings companies and insurance corporations. This led to the executives of these companies greatly enriching themselves to the tragic detriment of the little people who had entrusted them with their hardearned money. We see how academics from no less than Harvard and Columbia are hired by these same companies as consultants. And we also see that despite the promises of change by Pres. Barack Obama the same people who rode on the bubble are the same people heading the vital finance positions in the current government.Before I watched this film I did not really know anything about the global financial crisis other than cursory information about the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and AIG. I was not really sure what kind of financial companies they were. This film presents the details in easy to understand graphics and narration surprisingly by Matt Damon! I never thought I could grasp these complex economic concepts but this film succeeds to make me understand how that huge financial meltdown occurred. It is also a call for justice on behalf of the victims as the perpetrators instead of being convicted are still very much in the game. This is a very informative and very important film. The people of the USA and the world need to know this.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is a good basic primer about the financial crisis of 2008 for those who haven't really been following this story and have little or no financial knowledge. The official description promises that if you get angry when you think about the crisis you're going to get even angrier after you watch the movie. It delivers on that promise. Several of the interview scenes also deliver a few good laughs. The movie's main strength is the way it explores academia's contribution to the collapse. It exposes the conflict of interest of academics who are supposed to be independent expert voices in the field but who derive the bulk of their very lucrative incomes from paid consulting engagements on behalf of the financial services industry. This is an angle I hadn't seen covered before.It also illustrates how little has changed in the American financial world despite Obama's rhetoric. Rather than being held accountable for their role in the collapse many of its architects remain in key positions of powerOn the downside the movie oversimplifies the causes of the crisis. It focuses primarily on deregulation and Wall Street's incentive structure and culture of reckless risktaking and lax morals and ethics. It also briefly mentions poor risk assessments by credit rating agencies and predatory lending without really explaining what it was or getting into any depth on the matter.Subprime lending was mentioned only in a very cursory manner. There was no mention of the Clinton Administration's push for subprime lending to expand mortgage loans to low and moderate income people.There was no mention of the Federal Reserve's contribution to the housing bubble as a result of it's policy to ease credit conditions in the early 2000s to soften the impact of the collapse of the dot com bubble and the 911 terrorist attacks.There was no mention of the shadow banking system how it contributed to the crisis and how it greatly amplified the losses.There was no mention of David X. Li's Gaussian copula formula and how it was used by credit rating agencies to justify AAA ratings for collateralized debt obligations CDOs that consisted of baskets of higher risk debt instruments.I expected more from a fulllength feature documentary. I've seen TV shows that delved into greater depth on this issue. This movie pushes the right emotional buttons but ultimately it's light fare for those on a lowintellect diet.".

Li's Gaussian copula formula and how it was used by credit rating agencies to justify AAA ratings for collateralized debt obligations CDOs that consisted of baskets of higher risk debt instruments.I expected more from a fulllength feature documentary. I've seen TV shows that delved into greater depth on this issue. This movie pushes the right emotional buttons but ultimately it's light fare for those on a lowintellect diet.";

In fact it is so definite that it might tire the casual spectator a bit due to the overwhelming quantity of figures names and eternal parades of talking heads who explain the fails from the financial system or justify its existence.In Inside Job director Charles Ferguson interviewed bankers professors and politicians who offer their very diverse and occasionally contradictory opinions about the crisis its origin and the identity from the guilty ones. And when it is the turn of the guilty ones to appear they explain us why they did not do anything wrong. This film's first half is focused on the Wall Street scene but it eventually follows the road of destruction until leading to the common citizens who suffered the worst consequences from the crisis while the genuine offenders of the collapse were quietly retiring with compensations of hundreds of millions of dollars...which were many times funded by the huge packages of economical rescue the government of the United States awarded using the money from its contributors. Yes the same ones who lost their homes savings and jobs.But what takes Inside Job to horror levels is that in the end it shows us how the situation has not changed and how it is even getting worse with financial companies merging themselves into increasingly big organizations with a bigger influence on the international politics and in a constant fight against the regularization from markets which already proved their ineptitude to control the finances from the whole world. So even though I found Inside Job to be a cold repetitive and a bit tiring documentary despite Matt Damon's pleasant and modulated voice I also think that it is a valuable and interesting History and economy lesson which leaves us with a clearer idea about the precarious situation from modern civilization.".

	schema:reviewBody "Filmmaker Charles Ferguson takes a long hard skillful look at the individuals and their actions which brought about the global economic meltdown of 2008. It is hard to come away from this Oscar nominated documentary without feeling some combination of anger and depression. Anger because you see selfserving greed and even corruption among the financial leaders of this country. Depression because you see that many of people in charge of our financial institutions today including many in the highest positions in government are still not inclined to make changes to prevent another financial crisis. If you can take a dispassionate view of this story it feels as if you are watching a film showing you something about how the rise and fall of the Roman Empire came about in some distant time. In this case however we are dealing with contemporary times. We learn how an economic boom led to a desire among those in the financial and banking industries to make even more money as they transitioned from carefully investing their own money to going public and now risking other peoples' money for tremendous payouts for themselves. The complicated concepts of derivatives is actually made sickeningly clear as we see how investments were really bets with essentially no clear downside for the bankers but devastating results for the middle class. No place was this more relevant than in the home mortgage market where the financial guys would make their money on the volume of the mortgages sold and not on quality or the ability of people who bought them to pay them off. Matt Damon is the narrator of the film although Ferguson does much of interviews. The film is interspersed with film clips of the leading players of this giant debacle from the officers of the big financial institutions to the well known faces in government including Paulson Greenspan Geithner and others with major government responsibility for regulation and policy. We see the story of the march of deregulation from the Reagan through the Bush years even including some during the Clinton White House. There is also the apparent failure of the Obama administration  despite their bailout successes  to have regulated and overseen what should be regulated and overseen. The lack of prosecution of some of the glaring criminal activities is highlighted and the obscene executive compensations  sometimes more than a hundred million dollars  for people who participated in very questionable actions is spelled out.It is also quite disturbing to see the failure of he academic community to acknowledge the payments they receive from interested parties for their speeches and writings which supported the unstable financial situations that occurred. These days the medical community is usually obligated to make disclosures of potential conflicts of interest when speaking or writing  Granted the filmmaker is trying to make a point about the inside job which was pulled off on the American people. There may be some other points of view which he didn't show but interviews made with top people and the facts presented make it pretty easy to vote for conviction if we were the jury even without cross examination from another viewpoint. Ferguson did have a great deal of access to top people some of whom asked him to turn off the camera once they were shown their inconsistencies. The movie is well edited to one hour and 48 minutes. Most of the film is sharp and well framed. When archival footage is used and it makes a point you don't mind if it isn't topdrawer quality. Although a year old it is still right on the mark for today. If you have a stake in this economy and the future of our country you better understand what this film is saying. 2011".

	schema:headline " Oscar Winner thanks to its subject more than its skills.";
	schema:reviewBody "When reviewing a documentary like this I think it's fair to make a distinction between the subject matter of the documentary and the actual merits of the filmmaking itself. On the subject matter front Inside Job surely deserves all the awards it is receiving it recently won the Oscar for best documentary too. The film sets to explain the reasons or arguably some of the reasons behind the financial crisis that's hit the whole world. How did we end up where we are and whose to blame? It could be a fairly dry and dull subject  and a rather complicated one too but Inside Job for most of it manages to keep it simple and gripping at the same time without dumbing it down too much. Inevitably it ends up focusing more one one side of the argument the bankers as opposed to following the more controversial route going against the politicians. Though they do get mentioned the film prefers not to be so hard on them as it is on those corporate people obviously a much easier target. And since we are all on the same boat in this neverending financial crisis and we are so angry at the way the whole thing has been carried out and handled we are perfectly happy to see it all laid out the way it is and eventually everyone will come out it feeling even more angry and frustrated than they were before. On that respect the film obviously really works. As a piece of film Inside Job is less interesting. Its pace is very uneven sometimes a bit too fast when it should be slow and a bit slow when you just want it to get on with it for example there are way too many beginnings one of them is probably there just because it plants the seeds for one of the best jokes of film later on about the instability of Iceland. Not everything hits home as it probably should and not everything is as clear as it should be. After a while one million begins to sound a lot like 10 millions or 100 millions or even a billion it's just a whole lot of money which we'll never see anyway It gets slightly repetitive. In most sequences the documentary unravels like a series lectures of economy it is mainly voice over driven read by Matt Damon who seems to be everywhere these days visualised by unimaginative graphics and straight forward unremarkable archive footage. The real skill here seems to be more in the writing than the actual filmmaking. That's by no means a criticism. This isn't a film by Micheal Moore and for most of its length it doesn't even try to be one there are no stunts and on the surface no tricks either. And yet everyone who has seen this film will most likely remember the last third which is probably the closest thing to something that Michael Moore would do and to me the most interesting part. It is the moment the filmmakers turn against their contributors economists journalists and professors who are just as guilty as everyone else. Watching them sweat in their seats having to defend themselves when they thought they were just there to give us a history lesson is the most pleasurable part of the film. And because we all want to point fingers and blame everyone for their greedy needs we probably fail to notice the slightly biased use of the editing I'm thinking of all those moments when questions are asked offcamera just so that we can catch the surprised faces of the people who are being interviews and then the films cuts away to the next sequence without giving them really the chance to answer. We really don't mind though we hate those people anyway and as long as they look stupid and guilty we are happy with it. In the end it's great to see a documentary like this on a subject like the big economic crisis getting all the awards it's getting and though that doesn't necessarily mean that it's a masterpiece I hope it does mean we are ready to chance the way people regulate our economy 710 wp.mep19wJ2hJ".

In this one they totally look computer animated they moved different they seemed more flexible the way they morphed looked different as well. . they were also much faster and slightly smaller.I also had a problem with how they changed the action.

In this one if someone gets hit they fly 10 feet in the air and crash through walls. . it all seemed to 'Matrix' and less 'Underworld.'Things just looked exaggerated SPOILERS Like when a character is decapitated his head rather explodes and blood and guts fly everywhere whereas in the first one it simply fell off.If you can get over the few changes in the look and feel of the film and if you are a fan of the first this is a great movie. .

The film unashamedly boasts an adultsonly certificate and has consummate amounts of nastiness gore headripping and scary battles as well as realistic dollops of sex.Apart from the actual mechanics such as reaction to sunlight ways of causing death the vampires of Underworld have little in common with their namesake in literature  a fascinating creature that slowly saps its victim of strength. Several other fables are instead interwoven perhaps the most obvious being a Romeo and Juliet type love affair between the beautiful Selene Vampire heroine played by Kate Beckinsale and Michael the Lycan hybrid. There is also a Beauty and the Beast charm since both these characters display very human qualities at times such as their tenderness towards each other and the desire to minimise suffering. We long for them to rise above the terrible disease that pumps in their veins. There is a 'Mad Scientist' type underlay with the development of specialised weaponry and the search for the pure strain giving rise to Matrixstyle battles and last but not least Underworld borrows from the XMen idea of mutations and stylistically from more polished films of a not dissimilar ilk such The Crow or Blade.The name Selene means the moon goddess who was known for her countless love affairs and also her purity. Her sister was Eos the dawn. Michael is a Hebrew word meaning 'he who is like God'. But we're hardly interested in the psychology of plot structure and nameconundrums at this point are we? The thrill comes from watching Beckinsale Selene in a leather catsuit kick ass all the way to the nemesis or seeing the potentially very scary and equally photogenic Scott Speedman Michael show his gentle side as he gets her kit off or actors of the calibre of Derek Jacobi and Bill Nighy play really cruel vicious malevolent creatures that haven't been toned down for the under18yrolds or the inventive and bloody battles in fabulously Gothic settings. There's lashings of blood every few seconds sex mixed with blood for the pervy and tasteful delicate sex to remind us we're watching something artistic and not downright depraved even if we are. If anything Underworld Evolution delivers in spades what the first film only hinted at yet keeping some of the best elements Beckinsale's acrobatics car chases and great sets that set the original tone.The plot is far from simplistic so here's a reminder of what you need to absorb in the first few minutes in case you miss it or forget to take notes Vampire heroine Selene Kate Backinsale after dedicating most of her life to exterminate Lycans who she believes slaughtered her family when she was a child discovers she has been betrayed by her own kind. She teams up with Michael a VampireLycan hybrid a human who has become infected with both viral strains. While on the run with her Michael has to struggle to accept and understand his powers and he longs to end the war between Lycans and Vampires.Other important characters include Viktor Bill Nighy  a haughty ostentatious vampire overlord with a very dark side Selene awoke him prematurely from a long sleep to tell him of a Lycan offensive.Marcus  the last surviving Vampire Elder a Medieval Warlord. Mutated into a vampire from the bite of a bat. Felt compelled to raise Vampire warriors such as Viktor to control the Lycan horde. As he was awoken by the blood of a Lycan scientist 'Singe' however Marcus has become one of a terrifying new breed.William brother of Marcus. He mutated into a werewolf Lycan from a wolf bite and thence populated the region with the violent Lycan beasts.Alexander Corvinus Derek Jacobi is the first immortal the genetic father of both Lycan and Vampire. The pestilence of the Great Plague of Europe had mutated within him to become the Mother Virus which eventually became two separate diseases Vampire and Lycan as it was passed on to his sons Marcus and William.The film traces the evolution of these characters but you do need to concentrate to get the significance of the heavy battles that are heaped one upon each other. The real question is what will happen to Selene and Michael? The ending packs an emotional punch and paves the way for even more spectacular and hopefully bigger budget episodes. Stay to the end of the credits for some great heavy metal music.Underworld Evolution offers escapism that explores dark lusts power overweening ambition blind dedication and the purity of vision to surpass these. Just don't expect Shakespeare.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let's face it. If you're going to see this movie you probably enjoyed the original and are looking for more. You want high doses of fight scenes vampire and lycan lore blood violence and Kate Beckinsale wearing leather or less. In short this movie delivers all of the above in great excess so if you liked Underworld you're going to like Underworld Evolution as much or more.On the other hand if you don't like blood violence action mythology or using a sword in a world full of guns this movie is not for you and it's NOT MEANT to be for you so don't complain about it.This movie surpasses the original as far as story development. We learn a good bit about each character's past which helps justify all the extreme violence they engage themselves in. We're also introduced to some new characters and plot lines that add interest and new twists rather than just rehashing all the familiar faces from Underworld.This movie fails to get a 10 rating from me for the following reasons1 Not quite enough stuff to fill the time. Too many shots of Kate Beckinsale looking intense. The movie could have been 10 minutes shorter if the number of these shots had been reduced from seemingly infinite down to 10 or so. Minor problem.2 A few glaring continuity errors.3 Too many flashbackexplanation shots from the original Underworld. I suppose this is necessary so as not to alienate viewers who didn't see the original or who forgot it. However this movie is obviously targeted to people who liked the original and want more so give us a quick refresher and then hit us with new stuff. No need to keep providing Cliff's notes throughout the movie. Make us think a little!4 There wasn't a standout power move comparable to the spinningshooting through the floor in the original Underworld. Let's face it half the people that went to that movie did so because that shot was in the trailer. This movie had lots of power moves but none that stood out as the winner.".

I liked the first one but this one was an improvement. Mostly because of Scott Speedman's character Michael. The last movie only gave us a glimpse into what he has become and here we get to see him kick butt alongside Selene as what is pretty much an equal. Watching him fight and takedown werewolves was great.The action scenes were bigger with great direction and camerawork. the special effects are also great especially the scene with their wingednemesis pursuing their truck. Makeup is amazingly well done. It was refreshing to see that the werewolves were still practical makeup creations rather than CG.There was also the added bonus of sex scenes. one where a guy is having fun with a couple chick vampires and one between the two leads. we get to see most of Beckinsale's lovely figure MILF is an understatement but no direct frontal shots. ladies will enjoy much shirtless Speedman action.The opening segment makes it worth a look i definitely recommend it to anyone who liked the first or thought it had promise.".

	schema:headline " Enjoyable But Not Too Good Overall";
	schema:reviewBody "To start off let me say that I'm a very big fan of the original. I think it did everything right having a nice Gothic overtone great characters an original intriguing and indepth plot fun action and an overall script that never once felt dull. Oh and of course...it had Kate Beckinsale in tight leather hehehe. Now does this sequel contain all these qualities that made the original so good? Personally I'd have to say no I don't think it did. Was the movie necessarily bad? Also no. It was highly entertaining but not that good of a movie overall.STORYLINE The story in this film was no where near as good or developed as the original. As it starts off with a war scene in the past I found myself really enjoying it. We find out a little about the Corvinus family and the origins or Marcus who was the very first vampire and his brother who was the very first Lycan. But after we witness these scenes and learn these few minor plot details the story development pretty much comes to a dead stop. Honestly nothing really happens in this movie. It's all just action and really nothing more.CHARACTERS The lead characters were good. Selene and Michael didn't exactly have any development but that's okay because they were developed enough in the first film. But what was slightly developed was their romance which the first film seemed to be lacking. We really got to feel the connection between them and how much they really cared for each other. And it was great to see Michael show off his new hybrid abilities and kick some booty along the way. He was a lot cooler in this film than in the original. The new vampire leader Marcus was also pretty damn cool. He had a very sinister appearance especially with the devillike wings and didn't seem to have any sympathy at all as he brutally disposed of anyone who got in his way. In the original we had Lucian who was a well developed badguy character and I actually found myself caring for him. Marcus on the other hand didn't strike a cord with me at all. He looked cool sure but besides that he had absolutely nothing going for him and I really didn't care what happened to him. All the other characters in this film were also very undeveloped as well. We really knew nothing of them and as a result felt unsure whether we should like them or hate them. So that's a major issue.ACTION The action most the time was very enjoyable. And I stress MOST of the time not ALL of the time. There was some really fun action and fight sequences and a nice amount of blood and gore thrown into the mix. So it definitely does manage to entertain the action buffs. But then at times the action began to feel annoying as it got extremely repetitive. It was like they just kept replaying the same action scene over and over and just tweaked it a little in order to pass it off as a different scene. This was a problem because the whole movie seemed to base itself on action rather than story and the action wasn't even all that good.ATMOSPHERE Another good thing about this movie would have to be the scenery. Yeah I know that's not really important in the movie but it really did help with the overall experience. There were beautiful mountain landscapes snowy woods old style castles in ruins and gorgeous red colored twilight skies. So I think it actually helped a lot in setting the atmosphere and gets points for great eye candy.OVERALL The first film was an actionhorror movie with a great original storyline. This sequel on the other hand felt more like a series of left over action scenes that were taken out of the first film. I think watching the two films back to back will make a great overall experience. But as a standalone it doesn't quite work. It's fun for sure but that's about it. It's not even remotely close to being as good or better than the original in any way.".

The director did a great job of bringing you into his underworld. Every part of the story line was pleasantly unexpected. I like that Celine's love for Michael wasn't the only important part of this story anymore. It isn't mostly centered on love like the first one however it is all there from love to the long history to time jumping. I wouldn't recommend watching this if you haven't seen part 1!

	schema:reviewBody "As a fan of the first movie this was a absolute and utter disappointment. I was skeptical when I first heard about a sequel and now it seems that when Kevin Grevioux disappeared from the project without any form of explanation so went all the chances it had of being good. I truly wanted to enjoy this movie and envy those who can but there were just too many faults here for me to look past. The plot is first of all much too rushed and if you haven't watched the first movie it is hard to grasp despite all the flash backs that are quite clumsily conveyed here. The characterization of Selene takes a 180 degree turn and not for the better. When she in the first movie was portrayed as a cold and efficient warrior she here seems more like a female version of Lethal Weapon's Martin Riggs. She is also in the true spirit of the awful Mummy Returns revealed to have a past with the vampire world as a human as well as much more powerful as a vampire than we were first led on to believe. This was a development that quite efficiently killed all hat was good or interesting with her character and the ending when she is turned into some sort of super vampire that can match a hybrid and stand in sunlight drives the final nail in the coffin.She also has zero chemistry with Speedman's character who's most interesting lines are Jesus Christ and obviously have no bigger role than to serve as her object of rescue and the second part in one of the most anatomically incorrect and random sex scenes I've ever seen.The movie is all in all too much full of contradictions and suffering from a faulty script to be even remotely interesting. A grand example is how Markus the other hybrid gains Selene's memories when drinking her blood. Speedman's character also does that but yet we see no sign of him experiencing the same. Or how it is explained that Markus the first vampire becomes a hybrid simply by drinking lycan blood since he is a Corvinous. Should not his brother William the first lycan then also have become a hybrid when killing and eating vampires as it looks like he did plentiful? Or my favorite when Michael turns out to be wanted by the police as a dangerous criminal despite that he to my recollection did absolutely nothing that would warrant that in the first movie as well that while Selene cannot take being stabbed in the shoulder without passing out first movie a shot in the gut only makes her angry.I also find it quite irritating that up until the release there were many things speaking for a return or at least small featuring of Michael Sheen's character Lucian who also was a favorite for many to have it all ending with what seems like a double in a body bag. The actor's state as the lead's Beckinsale ex who is now also married to Wiseman offers a rather discouraging explanation for this. The violence is gory and unnecessary the action scenes badly filmed and confusing and the gracious nudity just tasteless. Wiseman has some incredible talent with making movies look good but he should in my opinion keep away from the script and contract Grevioux again for the next movie if there is one and see if he can salvage what is left from this mess.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was lame and very laughable. I went to see it with a bunch of my friends all of who are fans of the original one. There are so many reasons that this movie sucked that I forget more than half of them. I forget most of the plot holes inconsistencies to the first movie and random crap that was randomly put into this movie just to try to give some importance to everything but was too important but some how forgot to be mentioned in the first movie.First of all the sex scene? That was random stupid and I almost burst out laughing. Not only was it a random and unneeded scene used just to make little teenies be like OOH NAKED!! but in addition to that...The positioning of their bodys?? Do they really expect us to believe that he's having sex with her?? Well not unless he's having sex with her bellybutton! Speaking of nudity and sex the random scene where that guy is piling up the bodies of the nude girls shown just so they can better show that they have a naked lady in the movie. That scene was also stupid and pointless again just to make little teens say OOH BOOBIES!! and therefore it's a good movie.Secondly it was like a big hour and a half long fight scene. Don't get me wrong I love fight scenes especially big ones but the choreography of these fight scenes just sucked.Then there was the bridge that broke twice in the castle. First she blew up the ceiling which fell down and broke the bridge. Didn't the bridge break AGAIN when the helicopter came down? Oh and its a good thing that the rope is strong enough to pull down a helicopter and has no quickrelease. Oh and also that guy that was next to Selene on the bridge when William came out of the shadows grabbed the other guy and shot him...Why the hell did he turn into a werewolf? Werewolfs SHOOT you and suddenly you turn into one?? Let's not forget Hmm...lets bring my deadboyfriend's body with us...y'know just for sentimental reasons...and in case he happens to randomly come back to life he can help us. That was too lame and too predictable. I rolled my eyes when it showed him coming back to life. And then he tore off Williams head...the other time someone tore of a werewolves jaw. O yay we can tear of heads left and right because it'll be wicked cool! I liked how Selene didn't remember the little pendant thing until she pushed the little button thing on it and a little 14inch little jagged edge came out. You needed that little edge there in order to remember it?? Wow you have a suck memory.How come the helicopters blades were still spinning after it crashed? That was extremely stupid. And the way she pushed Markus and he just sort of floated back into them. Or was that supposed to be slow motion? Either way it looked lame. And don't you like the way the bridge led PERFECTLY to the helicopters blades and below the bridge there were supports for it right NEXT to were the helicopter crashed? Wow they have really good aim not to knock out those supports while crashing.And I like how now just stabbing a werewolfin front of that exiled guys home kills them. Y'know it's easier when you're trapped...just stab them with probably what was just a stainless steel knife.Oh and there was the EXTREMELY LAME line of Selene What will I become?? Old guy The future. I almost laughed there as well...seriously that is one of the lamest lines I've heard. This movie makes me think of an extremelyhighbudget Bmovie.There are plenty of other reasons but those are the only ones I can remember right now as to the lameness of this movie.".

	schema:headline " Underworld Evolution reviewed";
	schema:reviewBody "What can someone write about a movie that has been so well discussed already during the past weeks?! Everything has been said in reviews and fan forums about the plot with Romeo  Juliet resemblances framed by the secret war between vampires and werewolves about the cast and characters about the movie's style  atmosphere action makeup and CGI effects camera shots violence love scenes  nudity. Underworld Evolution's predecessor was above all underestimated in terms of what potential it had to build up a solid fan base in a genre that throughout movie history like no other has not only drawn people into the theatres but also to conventions fan clubs signings and other events. If we go back in time movies which threw together famous film monsters like in House of Frankenstein Frankenstein Meets The Wolf Man later in Frankenstein's Bloody Terror or in our days Freddie Vs. Jason Van Helsing and Aliens Vs Predator were most likely designed to squeeze the purse of the audience which in most cases without no doubt they successfully did but never have withstood the moviegoer's expectations for a long time. Underworld 2003 on the other hand a sleeper during it's theatrical release as treated with neglect promotion wise in many countries has to be admitted that it rightfully gained it's respect through mouthtomouth propaganda resulting in DVD sales which soon exceeded the boxoffice results. The movie built up a very solid fan base people that keep talking about it even after three years  creating an underworld sorry for the pun I just could not resist like Star Trek Star Wars and some other SciFi movies and shows have done before. So it is very possible that for the first time in the horror genre Underworld and Underworld Evolution really work as 'monster mash' movies.With only some video clips on his reference list it is obvious that Underworld was a child of heart of writer  director Len Wiseman together with writers Danny McBride and Kevin Grevioux. Only someone very dedicated and so confident can get such a project of the ground without having directed a single feature length movie before  get it produced assemble a professional cast. And it paid out  with an estimated budget of 22 mill. it achieved an accumulated worldwide gross of more than 90 mill. US dollars. Plus it activated a great number of fans which were dying to see more. Because of these fans there is a sequel  they made it possible by buying the DVDs watching Underworld in the cinema and kept talking about it discussing it from the beginning to the end throwing up questions inspiring new story lines etc. When seeing Underworld Evolution I believe that Len Wiseman and Danny McBride accurately meet the expectations of their fans in a very respective way. They stand true to the original in style and action and by not getting too pathetic love story wise. The storyline is not dumb and does not just follow the vampires vs. werewolves plot which it could have done. Of course it has some flaws but nothing which can be not excused. As there is no perfect crime there is also no perfect plot. All stories have flaws  even the real ones. And if we look behind the almost endless tourdeaction there is the beautiful Kate Beckinsale who was the lead action heroine in the first movie and now without loosing any of her screen presence she leaves enough space for Scott Speedman who now plays a much stronger and more selfconfident Michael Corvin. Bill Nighy is always an extreme pleasure to watch and it is amazing how versatile this man is. And of course there is the great Sir Derek Jacobi playing his part so wonderfully understated yet so present that it will be a hard task not to bring his character back in a future entry. Conclusion If you have seen the first Underworld movie and liked it and if you are allowed to pervasive strong violence and gore some sexualitynudity and language you won't be disappointed. If you don't like horror movies at all  this one is not likely to change your opinion. When you consider this and buy a ticket you will get an action packed horror movie which can be watched for more than one time for several reasons. But see for yourself ".

	onyx:emotionText "What can someone write about a movie that has been so well discussed already during the past weeks?! Everything has been said in reviews and fan forums about the plot with Romeo  Juliet resemblances framed by the secret war between vampires and werewolves about the cast and characters about the movie's style  atmosphere action makeup and CGI effects camera shots violence love scenes  nudity. Underworld Evolution's predecessor was above all underestimated in terms of what potential it had to build up a solid fan base in a genre that throughout movie history like no other has not only drawn people into the theatres but also to conventions fan clubs signings and other events. If we go back in time movies which threw together famous film monsters like in House of Frankenstein Frankenstein Meets The Wolf Man later in Frankenstein's Bloody Terror or in our days Freddie Vs. Jason Van Helsing and Aliens Vs Predator were most likely designed to squeeze the purse of the audience which in most cases without no doubt they successfully did but never have withstood the moviegoer's expectations for a long time. Underworld 2003 on the other hand a sleeper during it's theatrical release as treated with neglect promotion wise in many countries has to be admitted that it rightfully gained it's respect through mouthtomouth propaganda resulting in DVD sales which soon exceeded the boxoffice results. The movie built up a very solid fan base people that keep talking about it even after three years  creating an underworld sorry for the pun I just could not resist like Star Trek Star Wars and some other SciFi movies and shows have done before. So it is very possible that for the first time in the horror genre Underworld and Underworld Evolution really work as 'monster mash' movies.With only some video clips on his reference list it is obvious that Underworld was a child of heart of writer  director Len Wiseman together with writers Danny McBride and Kevin Grevioux. Only someone very dedicated and so confident can get such a project of the ground without having directed a single feature length movie before  get it produced assemble a professional cast. And it paid out  with an estimated budget of 22 mill. it achieved an accumulated worldwide gross of more than 90 mill. US dollars. Plus it activated a great number of fans which were dying to see more. Because of these fans there is a sequel  they made it possible by buying the DVDs watching Underworld in the cinema and kept talking about it discussing it from the beginning to the end throwing up questions inspiring new story lines etc. When seeing Underworld Evolution I believe that Len Wiseman and Danny McBride accurately meet the expectations of their fans in a very respective way. They stand true to the original in style and action and by not getting too pathetic love story wise. The storyline is not dumb and does not just follow the vampires vs. werewolves plot which it could have done. Of course it has some flaws but nothing which can be not excused. As there is no perfect crime there is also no perfect plot. All stories have flaws  even the real ones.

All that was intriguing genuine attractive in the first movie has been thrown out in the garbage can. A movie is essentially a story. A good sequel is a movie where you tell different things in the same way where moviegoers get the same feelings but in a different way. If you bump off in the first 20 min. all the characters who had survived form part one Kraven the blond vampirewoman and all the Covent that's fair evidence that you think a plot is made by a collection of fight scenes plus some cheesy nudity and new characters their only purpose being to be slaughtered. Corvinus and Tanis could bring something interesting in the move but they are vapid shallow and lifeless even before they get killed. Actually Corvinus was really not needed unless it would become a major figure of the movie not a selfmurdering 700 year old loser. A real waste. Not mentioning the flaws of continuity logic and lore tradition this is about how vamp and werewolves can be killed. Common sense is also sorely lacking in the movie especially when we have been told by many movies how helicopters crash... by the way why Marcus  after supposedly having been resurrected many times in the past centuries  got just now the urge to free his brother? The film is an insult to fans of Underworld and a not recommendable one for those who are not in the genre.".

Sexy costumes menacing weapons and killer moves seem to be the order of the day. It's no doubt that Underworld would have a sequel since it was obviously hinted at after the end credits of the original though it would be three years before it materialized.And Kate Beckinsale still looked as hot as the pastywhite faced black and blue eyed vampire known as a Death Dealer. Actually that's one of the extremely few good things about this movie. We get to see her more see her in action more ahem love scene some more to keep the fan boys happy with her twin rapid firing handguns and flitting around action sequences without tearing her outfit.The other good thing about this movie is if you're a fan of blood and gore you'll be kept happy with the many decapitations in various creative ways piercings shootings at point blank and endless gunfire.Unfortunately these good points were thin after a while and seriously you'll be clock watching for it to end. The movie starts off by going back to the early beginnings of the feud and tries to explain blood ties and brotherly love in the times when the Death Dealers were wearing handmedown armor from the elves in Lord of the Rings. For those who are unfamiliar with the first movie fret not this movie does spend some time to try and explain the convoluted plot to you in a series of quick flashbacks. Sometimes so much that I think the entire first movie had been told here in fast forward.And what a convoluted plot it is! Somehow you know that our heroes can't die  one's a superhuman hybrid never seen before while the other is Seline the invincible who defied all odds to survive past the first film. But invulnerability makes a character weak as it takes away the fun. Injuries heal in record time ok so they're vampires who recuperate in the darkness and you'll really wonder if the Highlander way is the only way for a character to perish. The central plot about brotherhood and the quest to unleash the very first Lycan was pretty boring stuff.Somehow the production seemed a little lazy too. In the first movie we had sets which are more in tuned to the present world with the city and all. But this movie seemed to like darkness and worn out locations and even the finale set looked suspiciously similar to the original's. And I learnt too that vampires can transfer abilities and skills by letting another suck its blood much like Chinese Martial Arts films where the kungfu master imparts his skills to his disciples using internal strength  you'll become stronger overnight.I had great hopes that the sequel would present itself as superior to the original especially if it could develop a strong back story. However I was proved wrong and this sequel like many others pale when compared to the original. I don't think there'll be another sequel given the characters becoming who they are at the end almost a copy of XMen 2's camera moving across a body of water shot with voice over but then again you'll never know.".

But even those lovely accouterments can not save this tragedy called a movie. Lord deliver us from terrible producers who can't recognize good writing and story development even if it hit them with a Mack Truck.Plot what plot. I couldn't even find an outline.UE picks up right where the 1st one leaves off. Selene is struggling with the weight of the murder of an elder on her shoulders and Michael. However Michael is a weight we know she will carry gladly. However the hot steamy sexiness is not enough to justify seeing this movie. With obvious pathetic and clich plot twists and worse cliff hangers with no meaning or use this movie if you can call it that falls flat on its face and then gags its self when its too stupid to realize that you just have to turn over on your back.The back story is unnecessary and quite long winded. The only caveat is the amount of bloodshed. No I take that back even the amount of blood spilled is not enough to make it better. Fast forward to the present. Marcus is awake and boy is he angry and hungry.Ooh look food in the pretty pretty package of Kraven.Alas poor viewers we knew him well. Errr no we didn't.Marcus finds the key to his happiness in the form of blood memories. These memories aid him in his very old very predictable quest. Which has him on a killing rampage and an eating frenzy. Look at all these walking meals and yeeough he'll eat anything.If we all remember from Underworld the infusion of Lycan blood that woke Marcus in the first place made Marcus into a stronger flying insectbatvampire thingie! This flying improvement tries to dominate the movie by being the boogie man. Sadly the only thing he accomplishes is acting like a brat throwing a bloody temper tantrum. Too bad his milkshake is better than yours.Then we learn in inappropriate cut aways and obvious leading that pretty pretty Michael has the key to things literally. I do mean that. As we are hit in the head with big cement blocks we find out that Selene is the map. What a pretty map.Things all come together when we find out that 'Daddy' has been watching all this time. 'Daddy' cleans up after his children and of course calls on Selene to do what he can not because in the end Victor was right. Poor Victor he was the only saving grace to this series and damn if they didn't kill him off too early. Those boys can't be left unattended they tend to start pesky blood feuds and have illused loyalty and hatred tendencies. When loyalty overrides good sense and real monsters are allowed to roam free and unchecked in their little world. Because dang it we want it! and pooh on anyone who disagrees.A dirty bloody and pesky business these blood feuds. Onward I digress. With all this 'angst' flying around we have a sadly attended side story of pretty pretty Michael still struggling with the fact that he is no longer human. Too bad the only way to convince him is to kill him over and over and over again. Maybe by the end of the movie our slow pretty pretty may get it. Cause really he like dies at least 3 times. No really! One time he even tried to kill himself. sigh Why are all the pretty ones so slow! Poor Selene! He better be good in the sack because really! Though from what I saw I wasn't sure but a few scenes tell me otherwise after. Now I'm not a porn aficionado but I do know that Tab A should fit in Slot B but from what I can tell vampirewerewolf hybrids do it a bit differently! and I still wouldn't kick him outta bed cause anybody can be taught! Now armed with gifts from Daddy Selene sets out to kill. Kill Marcus and everything that would make Marcus happy. Marcus dared to take what was hers and now he must pay. KILL! KILL! KILL! With all Selene's new gifts she still has to get wet. sigh The trouble a girl has to go through for a good killing.Over all the fight scenes are lethargic and have no pop or momentum. So even if the only reason to watch the movie was for T and A and some good action. Well you barely get 1 out 2. No the pun was not intended.I was bored and bitterly disappointed. I find a movie a failure if I deem it necessary to check my voice mail during the show. Not to mention do a little jig when I get to drool at Scott just a little bit longer.If I could I would give it a 0!".

But nothing could have prepared me for the abomination which I was forced to witness. I think the basic premise is kind of interesting.. vampires versus lycanthropes. The first thing that caught my eye was a rather sensual moment half way through the movie. With scene after scene of senseless gore and the usual 40000 round clips being emptied into the main characters with little result you'd think a love scene would be welcomed. Boy was I wrong. This was no love scene... this was flat out monkeysex. Usually the camera stays tastefully above the waist.. not here my friends! You might think this sounds sexy but it wasn't. You see they showed naught one bit of the girl but plenty of manass gyrating between two deathly pale vampire legs. Imagine the host of Tales from the Crypt taking a shower... yeah it was about that sexy. And then half way through the movie came my favorite scene of all. The girl tells her lycanthrope friend drink this blood otherwise the hunger will strike and you might attack a human without warning. So what does he do? He doesn't drink the blood and decides to go hang out at the nearby tavern. Well gee I wonder what's about to happen? When will Hollywood realize that we want heroes that are not complete dips. Anyhow yeah.. next thing you know hes tossing humans around like rag dolls and running away from a swarm of cops. The rest of the movie consisted of the male lycan having trouble killing the lowliest of werewolves one second and taking on the superpowerful lord of the vampires with ease the next. But that's not all folks they saved the worst for last. The whole plot of the movie is that the bad vampire is trying to release his SUPER powerful lycanthrope brother from a prison and the heroes must stop him because this lycanthrope incredible supervillain. Well at the end of the movie the super werewolf is in fact released and we see it for I don't know about five SECONDS before the hero rips it's head off. Oh yes you heard me. They didn't even SHOW his fight with the plotline defining character. They actually just used a quick cut away from the female hero shooting things to show just the part where the beasts head is being torn off. Wow good thing they went through all that work keeping him from being released. I'd be surprised if that werewolf could have even left the castle without a rascal scooter. I bet he was all white because he was old and tired not super powerful. They should have taken him to a nursing home and fed him the werewolf version of Ensure. Although I guess if you think about it the fact that they ripped the head off a poor defenseless old werewolf was the most interesting part of the whole movie.".

With scene after scene of senseless gore and the usual 40000 round clips being emptied into the main characters with little result you'd think a love scene would be welcomed. Boy was I wrong. This was no love scene... this was flat out monkeysex. Usually the camera stays tastefully above the waist.. not here my friends! You might think this sounds sexy but it wasn't. You see they showed naught one bit of the girl but plenty of manass gyrating between two deathly pale vampire legs. Imagine the host of Tales from the Crypt taking a shower... yeah it was about that sexy. And then half way through the movie came my favorite scene of all. The girl tells her lycanthrope friend drink this blood otherwise the hunger will strike and you might attack a human without warning. So what does he do? He doesn't drink the blood and decides to go hang out at the nearby tavern. Well gee I wonder what's about to happen? When will Hollywood realize that we want heroes that are not complete dips. Anyhow yeah.. next thing you know hes tossing humans around like rag dolls and running away from a swarm of cops. The rest of the movie consisted of the male lycan having trouble killing the lowliest of werewolves one second and taking on the superpowerful lord of the vampires with ease the next. But that's not all folks they saved the worst for last. The whole plot of the movie is that the bad vampire is trying to release his SUPER powerful lycanthrope brother from a prison and the heroes must stop him because this lycanthrope incredible supervillain. Well at the end of the movie the super werewolf is in fact released and we see it for I don't know about five SECONDS before the hero rips it's head off. Oh yes you heard me. They didn't even SHOW his fight with the plotline defining character. They actually just used a quick cut away from the female hero shooting things to show just the part where the beasts head is being torn off. Wow good thing they went through all that work keeping him from being released. I'd be surprised if that werewolf could have even left the castle without a rascal scooter. I bet he was all white because he was old and tired not super powerful. They should have taken him to a nursing home and fed him the werewolf version of Ensure. Although I guess if you think about it the fact that they ripped the head off a poor defenseless old werewolf was the most interesting part of the whole movie.";

It just takes some time for me to get over the disappointment for this movie and now I'm ready to write something about it.Overall the movie wasn't horrible. It was very average and thus objectively I gave it that score. However compared to the first Underworld movie this one is much inferior. I recently saw Underworld again and gave it an 8 Acting wise it was about on par with the first movie though neither movie contains Oscar level acting. For some reason the action wasn't as smooth as the first one and I felt jarred around a bit during some of the action sequences. Also the CGI didn't look as good as the first movie. Add to that a pretty muddled storyline where they pretty much explained everything away and the explanation wasn't that cool either the movie lost all of the charm it had in the first one.To me the Underworld universe was cool because of the new take on vampirewerewolf stories the mysteries that we're trying to find out and the very slick style. All three were thrown out the window for Underworld 2 thus making it just your runofthemill action flick. How disappointing.Oh yeah the ending was one of the most clichd action movie endings I've seen. There's also a very uncomfortable scene in the middle of the movie where it's just completely gratuitous and I usually like those scenes  So all in all rent this movie or don't see it at all.".

	schema:reviewBody "Title Underworld Evolution 2006 Director Len Wiseman Cast Kate Beckingsale Scott Speedman Michael Sheen Shane Brolly Bill Nighy Derek Jakobi Review The first Underworld was alright not great...just alright. But after a while it sort of grew on me. The first time I saw it I thought...man this really isn't what it could have been. And it wasn't. It was missing more action vampires and fights between the bloodsuckers and the werewolves. Did the sequel succeed in giving us what was missing in the original? The story this time around is about the first original vampire and the first original werewolf. In this movie the first vampire was called Marcus and his brother William was the first werewolf. They are at war because William the leader of the werewolf pack is a vicious mofo killing and destroying villages left and right. Viktor the leader of the vamps wants William locked up for all eternity Marcus Williams vampire brother is against it...but goes with it for the sake of being at peace with Viktor. Fastforward a few thousand years...and now Marcus wants to set his brother free in order to create a new race of half vampires half werewolves.Len Wiseman gives this sequel the same polished squeaky clean look that the first movie had. In terms of look and feel this film is very much like the original film. Everything seems to be filtered through a bluemetallic light. The film looks slick. The only thing that really changes is that the first film took place in more of an urban setting...here we go into the sticks. Lots of mountains caves and abandoned buildings in the middle of nowhere.This film improved on a lot of things that the first film was missing. First of all the vampires on this movie are more vicious which was something that I hated from the first movie. On the first movie the vampires where portrayed as these bunch of pansies hanging out in mansions drinking blood in wine glasses and gossiping about each other. On this one those gossipy vampires are gone replaced by a vicious and bloodthirsty Marcus who is resurrected from his long slumber.The coolest part about this movie for me was the vampire Marcus the make up effects work on this character was fantastic. His gigantic bat like wings which turn out to be quite deadly are awesome! This character is really evil violent and lets his vampire nature run loose. Basically he wont have problems sucking the life out of anyone who stands in his way.And speaking of special make up effects kudos to Wiseman for choosing to use actors in wolf suits instead of overusing the computer effects. I loved how the werewolves looked more realistic in this sense. Of course there is CGI involved in certain sequences but it is kept in check and not overused. The transformation sequences are great as well.There were a few things that didn't make some sense to me though. Like for example why was Marcus the only vampire to have wings? OK he was the first vampire ever...but wouldn't his offspring have wings also? No explanation is given about this during the movie. Also if Marcus and William were the first vampires and werewolf ever...how did they become what they became? They're origins are not explored but simply taken for granted. I didn't get that either. And how can William be locked up inside of a sarcophagus for thousands of years the just pop out and walk around as it he had only been locked up for one day or two? He had not fed werewolves as far as I know don't live forever and his hair isn't the least bit longer...what? Maybe I missed something amidst all the vampire lore and flashbacks. And there are a lot of those. I'm guessing a lot of these questions will be answered on a future sequel so lets hold out for it I'm sure it will happen.The movie does kind of have certain sequences in which they simply talk waaay to much. These vampires love to just chat chat chat in the most dramatic way about things. In that way this film is very similar to the first one.On the bonus side we do get to see part of Kate Beckinsales nude body but only partially. She never really goes all the way. It must have been hard for Wiseman to see his wife making out with Speedman. By the way ladies Speedman shows his bum. So enjoy it! So in conclusion this film has taken all of the things that didn't work on the first one and fixed em. There's more blood more action better effects the werewolves seem more realistic and the evil vampire leader is one vicious mother. Good sequel dare I say it certainly is better then the original.Rating 4 out of 5".

	schema:reviewBody "Feel free to dismiss any reviewer that immediately admits to disliking Underworld and then claims that Underworld Evolution is just as bad as the original. Does it really surprise anybody that this is a movie for people who enjoyed the original? Didn't like the first one? Then why subject yourself to a followup that you expect to equally loathe? You have no one to blame but yourself if you spend your time or money on it. That being said...This is how you make a sequel! I'll gladly admit it  I'm a fan of Underworld. I own it on DVD. Yes Kate Beckinsale in leather has a lot to do with it. If she were at the local library decked out in leather and reading from the phone book then I'd gladly pay 8 to attend. But the movie has more going for it than just the hot babe factor. The style story and stunts they delivered on a mere 22 million budget are incredibly impressive. It's a true testament to what can be accomplished when fans of a genre make a movie using ideas that are bigger than their bankroll.Thankfully Underworld Evolution picks up where the first one leaves off and never bothers to slow down. An inevitable question is how does it compare to the first? I hesitate to say I prefer one over the other. It's akin to trying to choose which Beckinsale pose is the sexiest. How do you choose? Aren't they all essential? From a technical standpoint there's no question that Evolution is better. The CGI is sharper the animatronic werewolves are bigger and badder the fight scenes are more intense and I'm pretty sure Kate's leather is a little tighter. But both movies are equally important to the overall story. Each can be viewed as a necessity in light of the other.What stands out most prominently in Evolution other than Kate's mere presence is there's just more to it. Take any expression or adjective that you feel adequately describes the original and add er to it. It's gorier. It's bloodier. It's sexier. It's faster. It's actionpackeder. OK so that last one doesn't work but you get the point. Whether you can tolerate the extra blood and gore is a matter of personal taste but we're talking werewolves and vampires. Anybody who walks out of the theater claiming There was too much blood! could probably use a good slapping.However story isn't sacrificed for the sake of juiced up stunts and explosions. The element most essential to Evolution's success is its abundance of backstory which effectively maintains continuity with the first film. Remember Amelia? You haven't forgotten about Viktor and what he did to Selene's family have you? Gaps are filled and details are expounded upon to give us a couple of nice twists that keep the plot fresh and interesting.That's it. That's all I'm going to say about the movie. Further elaboration is neither necessary nor useful. See it and absorb it all for yourself. I do recommend watching your Underworld DVD beforehand because it'll cut down on some possible confusion. Of course some of you fanboys probably have the original memorized rendering a 203rd viewing redundant.Are you already a fan of Underworld? If so then you'll likely view this as a worthy sequel. It's stylish it's dark it's atmospheric and it's still sportin' that sweet hybrid 'tude.Or did you hate the original? If so then do yourself and us a favor and save your money. No one really wants to hear you complain that this is just as bad. Are you just looking for an excuse to play Billy BadBone on the Internet message boards? No doubt it allows you to put your whining to good use but can't you find another skill to finetune?".

I had hopes that this was at least be as good as the original.In its favour the style and colours are great. Len Wiseman knows how to make a good looking film. It sets the standard for what a modern vampire movie should look like. I loved the dark slick style. It excels beyond the first film in its smoothness and pace.The element that lets the film down is the story or lack thereof. The first film presented a complicated story with the whole vampire elders in hibernation thingwerewolvesbloodlines etc. Evolution doesn't follow on from this it creates all these extra unnecessary plots that ruin it. I didn't find that the new twists added interest at all because the story became so convoluted and all over the place that it destroyed the legacy of the first film. Some people may like that however I wanted to see the next chapter of Selene and Michael not a whole new 'adventure' for them to embark on.First Selene suddenly remembered things that weren't even hinted at in the first film.Second the werewolf at the end spent a lot of time just standing in one place being shot. Cool looking bullet effects but a very stupid werewolf.Third surely Viktor would know that Marcus isn't to be trusted and would lock him up. Another departure from the first film where nothing from Evolution's mixed up story is even hinted at apart from the death of Selene's family which is neither here nor there.Fourth Michael is still a wuss. He may be a hybrid but he isn't particularly good at anything. Selene says his powers could be limitless but all he does is survive lots of bullets in one scene and comes back from the dead. Granted that takes talent but doesn't look good on film. Plus he's a bit weak. I thought his makeup in the first film was extraordinary however.Fifth Alexander Corvinus?? What sort of a leftfield useless plot introduction was that? I think that the writers tried to create some new 'better' story that relied upon superfluous twists rather than solid mature story development.Six highly unnecessary sex scene. Admittedly Kate Beckinsale is very cute and Michael and Selene were always on the cards but quite gratuitous sp?. I do wonder what it was like for Len to direct that.Seventh There seemed to be no repercussions from Selene killing Viktor. No one was hunting them no one tried to capture them. Marcus chased them but that was for entirely different reasons. In fact there were very few vampires in the film at all.Eighth the final scene sucked.Overall it was very disappointing. Rather than try to make up a whole new storyline they should've just made a good film. But that's only my opinion.".

	schema:reviewBody "I will forever be confused as to why the Metascore on this film is the lowest of any of the Underworld movies. Let's be honest nobody is going into these films with the possible expectation of an Oscar nomination. You either play this movie because A you like Vampires andor Werewolves or B and the most obvious reason Kate Beckinsale. In my opinion this is the best installment in the Underworld franchise I have yet to see Blood Wars but from what I've heard that wont be a contender. I think this is the best because it has everything that people should be watching this movie for in my opinion. Good action surprisingly good CG for a 2006 film fantasy thriller with a 50000000 budget which seems like a lot until you realize that Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter had a 69000000 budget in 2012 and was less than stellar... lots of Kate Beckinsale from lots of great angles and involvement from each angle of the VampireLycan story. So I end with this.. if you're going into this expecting stellar acting no plot holes and no desire to see mostly biting blood death then don't see this. If you're going into this having seen any other Underworld movies and wanting more of a very attractive British actress in tight black leather killing werewolves among other things... then I am confident that you will enjoy this second installment more than any of the others.710 hope this helps the uncertain viewer!".

Markus Tony Curran has a great look to him and he's a great antagonist although I can't say he has the presence of the great Bill Nighy. His brother is a great looking werewolf but he's a mindless monster so his threat is somewhat limited from my perspective. The decision makes him a lackluster villain who spills plenty of blood but nothing else.The score by Marco Beltrami is a damn good one loving his works. The action in Hollywood fashion is intense and enjoyable. The vivid sex scenes are merely eye candy but I'm sure most won't complain. I highly recommend the movie but the first one is still the greatest by far.".

	schema:reviewBody "Has there ever been a more misunderstood film than Martin Scorcese's The Last Temptation Of Christ? Released amid great controversy and accused of being an offensive and unholy film the truth of the matter is that it is a deeply reverent work which has the courage to ask challenging questions about the pressures and doubts Jesus must have experienced as the appointed Messiah. It also shows the violence of the times in graphic detail. If viewers consider it blasphemous to explore on film the immense burden of duty that Jesus bore through his life then they are narrowminded and ignorant. If people feel that to show the brutality and harshness of life in Roman times is tasteless and inappropriate then they are guilty of glorifying difficult but factual truths. There is NOTHING offensive about this film. There is however much that is challenging.Jesus Willem Dafoe an honest carpenter saves Mary Magdalene Barbara Hershey from a stoning. Already dimly aware that he is destined to lead an extraordinary life he soon finds himself being drawn into the role of a religious figurehead. But Jesus finds it hard to accept that he is a Messiah and as his reputation and following grows he constantly questions if he is a strong enough man to handle the burden of being God's son. After isolating himself in the desert where he experiences several hallucinations in which he is confronted by visual manifestations of good and evil Jesus finally concludes that he IS the true son of God and wholeheartedly sets about imparting his love and wisdom to all who'll listen. Later betrayed to the disgruntled Romans by his friend Judas Iscariot Harvey Keitel Jesus is crucified. While on the cross he imagines what his life would have turned out like if he had shied away from his duty as the Messiah and lived life like a mere mortal.It is this final section of the film that has provoked the most vociferous outrage. The sequence shows Jesus as he slowly dies on the cross dreaming of an alternative life in which he sins and copulates and hates like all normal people. Many people have criticised the film on the grounds that these scenes are blasphemous. Such claims are nonsense  the film is not saying that Jesus was a sinner nor that he gave in to temptation of the flesh nor still that he was a man filled with hate. The film is merely saying that in such great pain and so close to death while still just a young man he might  just maybe  have wondered if it was all worth it. At the end of the film we see Jesus accept his role knowing that his death is the ultimate act of unselfish love so the film actually is totally in agreement with what all Christians believe. If the film had come to the conclusion that Jesus's whole life was a waste his death too then maybe the detractors would've had cause to complain. But how can they possibly be offended by the film as it stands? For goodness sake it's a film about absolute faith!!! In truth The Last Temptation Of Christ is an excellent movie. Compellingly acted beautifully shot on Moroccan locations and full of telling ideas it is a work of real depth and power. The accents are sometimes distracting and some of the dialogue occasionally betrays illsuited modernisms but apart from these minor drawbacks it is one of the most important and thoughtprovoking films ever made.".

	schema:reviewBody "Condemned by Fundamentalists upon release delayed by outcries from hypocrites and liars and boycotted in any city where it played The Last Temptation of Christ is one of the most controversial movies ever made. Instead of showing Christ as a fearless and perfect person The Last Temptation depicts Him as a person who fought his destiny and wished to be just another mortal human being. Religious groups who couldn't and still can't accept the fact that Jesus was human were shocked by such ideas and refused to see the film or read the landmark novel on which it was based. They'll never know that they attacked one of the most honest and loving depictions of Christ.The Christ we see in the film is not based on the teachings of the Gospels or any scripture for that matter. Instead we get a portrait of Christ the man not Christ the Savior. We get to see his faults his fears and anxieties. Then we get to see him overcome those and find the strength to fulfill his destiny. The Last Temptation of Christ is not afraid to say that Jesus was weak before he became the Savior and that makes the film all the more satisfying. This is a tale of redemption courage and love like no other.There is no reason to miss this film. Not everyone will like it but at the very least it will let you see another perspective of the story. And even if you can't accept the story you won't be able to deny the greatness of Scorsese's direction. From the epic crowd scenes to the intimate oneonone conversations to the stunning final shot which was actually caused by an overexposed section of film but is beautiful nonetheless you will be awed by Scorsese's work here.Also stunning is the work of the two leads. Willem Dafoe inhabits the role of Christ perfectly bringing perfectly controlled emotion to each and every scene. Harvey Keitel as Judas has been the subject of debate because of his NYC accent. That was on purpose Scorsese used accents to denote the descent of characters. American accent  Israelite British accent  Roman but it doesn't even matter. Keitel is brilliant no matter what his accent is.Honest human loving and unafraid The Last Temptation of Christ is one of the great cinematic achievements of all time.

	schema:headline " The Hope of Conquering Temptation";
	schema:reviewBody "Martin Scorsese directs one of his finest achievements in a career of directing finest achievements. He takes on a subject close to his heart and close to his faith. Nikos Kazantzakis wrote an extraordinary piece of work on the life of Jesus of Nazareth. The last temptation takes place while Jesus is on the cross but before that we watch Jesus William Dafoe try to overcome temptation as an everyday man. That's what Kazantzakis focuses on. While Christ is on the cross the pain and sacrifice wouldn't be the same if he didn't feel it and showing Jesus in the form of an everyday man may offend some devout Christians but if they're offended then they're missing the point. God sent his son down to this earth to die for mans sins. That's what scriptures tell us but Kazantzakis takes us down an intriguing road as the son of God battles the temptations of the everyday man yet without sin. We watch Jesus struggle with acceptance that he is the messiah but eventually he accepts his role. We watch Jesus tempted by evil but he resists. When some hit's him he turns the other cheek. He has love and he has love for everyone and everything. He doesn't have hate he doesn't have sin Jesus is a perfect creature in a man's body sent to do God's work. Martin Scorsese depicts him no differently than he's imagined or believed to have been.The final act is the greatest part of the film maybe the most controversial. It shows Jesus taken down off the cross by his guardian angel something that didn't happen according scriptures. As you watch this and if you know the story and haven't read the novel you become baffled. You don't know what to think or how to interpret it. We see Jesus doing things he never did like having sex having children and living out the rest of his life as an everyday man living a good humble life old and tired. Only until the final moment and the final shot of the film does the entire third act make complete sense which makes the final statement by Jesus all that more powerful It is accomplished! It isn't done in a negative manner. Kazantzakis and Scorsese aren't showing Jesus full of sin for no good reason. Showing the hallucination and showing Satan tempting Christ in his weakest moment is what makes Jesus' sacrifice even more powerful. Not only did he die for the sin of man but he died for the sin of man while being tempted to live a normal and happy life as a man by Satan in the form of a beautiful guardian angel. There would be no torture no death no pain no sacrifice but here Jesus fights his temptations and accepts his role and the path God sent him on. He dies on the cross in agony with temptation from Satan at his weakest moment. He's triumphant in a way that is hard to see triumph but not only does he accept the sins of man and not only does he sacrifice his life but he defeats Satan and conquers temptation... as a man. Jesus is a powerful figure without sin and neither Scorsese nor Kazantzakis show him as anything less than the Lord and Savior. The film should leave you questioning your ability to resist temptation as Jesus did. As a devout Christian one would think you'd be more appreciative of the depiction in this film than any other film ever made on this subject. The Last Temptation of Christ is a powerful film done without sensation without hate but with taste respect love and appreciation for his sacrifices and his ability to resist temptation and go on with the plan when as a man Jesus could have taken the easy way out. He didn't. He sacrificed his life and went through the pain and suffering as a man. Not as a God where he knows there is no pain and he'll born again in three days but as a man that can feel all the things we feel and resist all things we don't resist.Personally I have serious doubts about every word that I've come across or every biblical story I've ever heard. I am not a Christian. I'm not atheist. I'm nothing more than a skeptic but this film did something that I would never think possible I had a religious experience and almost for a second became a believer. This is one of the most profound and powerful films ever made even though it has some serious flaws. You don't have to believe in God or Christianity to enjoy this film simply an opened mind.".

	onyx:emotionText "Martin Scorsese directs one of his finest achievements in a career of directing finest achievements. He takes on a subject close to his heart and close to his faith. Nikos Kazantzakis wrote an extraordinary piece of work on the life of Jesus of Nazareth. The last temptation takes place while Jesus is on the cross but before that we watch Jesus William Dafoe try to overcome temptation as an everyday man. That's what Kazantzakis focuses on. While Christ is on the cross the pain and sacrifice wouldn't be the same if he didn't feel it and showing Jesus in the form of an everyday man may offend some devout Christians but if they're offended then they're missing the point. God sent his son down to this earth to die for mans sins. That's what scriptures tell us but Kazantzakis takes us down an intriguing road as the son of God battles the temptations of the everyday man yet without sin. We watch Jesus struggle with acceptance that he is the messiah but eventually he accepts his role. We watch Jesus tempted by evil but he resists. When some hit's him he turns the other cheek. He has love and he has love for everyone and everything. He doesn't have hate he doesn't have sin Jesus is a perfect creature in a man's body sent to do God's work.

I can never relate to those films so they aren't believable. The Last Temptation of Christ is totally different. It was banned by intolerant Christians who didn't even see it because they have conflicting viewpoints which is one hell of a paradox. I use to say that Christ was described as a demigod in the Bible because He is halfman and halfgod but I was told that He is really allman and allgod. If the latter thesis is correct than he most have all the perfections of god as well as all the faults of man. In the movie Jesus is not perfect. He sins or at least He confesses sins. He is haunted by visions and sounds almost to where He goes on the brink of insanity. He is tempted by Satan over and over again into thinking that he is just a man. When He cures a person of blindness He does not smile he frowns in pain because for every man he cures he knows it brings him closer to the cross. The characterization in this  movie is excellent. This script is Schrader's best although it was rewritten. The music is the best I've ever heard in any films. Scorsese's direction was absolutely superb. Willem Dafoe and Harvey Keitel were excellent as well. And the movie leads you to the most haunting portayal of the crucifixion in cinematic history.It is a must for any person to see especially if you were outraged by the fact that Jesus is displayed as imperfect. You cannot do the film justice if you don't watch the whole film. You may be offended throughout the entire film but it all comes together in the end and all is well. Seriously I give the film five stars.".

This is certainly one of Martin Scorsese's great accomplishments in his extensive and highly acclaimed carrier. This movie was very important to Scorsese and he would put it off several times because he felt he wasn't ready to do it. I think that the wait was worth it because this was an outstanding movie. This is one of those movies that you either really liked or really didn't like. Most of the people who didn't like this found it to be a mockery of the Gospels and Christ himself. I liked it because it did follow the Bible very closely it was a fantastic telling of Jesus Christ's last days and his greatest accomplishments and because the acting was very good.I thought Willem Defoe was spell binding as Jesus Christ. Some people will say that he wasn't enough like Jesus but you do have to realize that this is probably the hardest character to play and I think that Defoe did the best job that anyone could have done at playing Christ. Harvey Keitel did an equally excellent job at playing Judas Jesus's best friend who eventually betrays Him so the world can be saved. This may be Keitel's best performance if not it is one of the three. Barbara Hershey was also a great supporting roll as Mary Magdalene.This movie is certainly not for everyone. Many people with very strong religious convictions will see this movie as offensive simply because Christ is portrayed a frightened man who sees his fate as a burdon through 'half' of the film and I implicate the word 'half' for a reason. For everyone else I say go rent this because this is a powerful and magnificent version of the final months of Christ. When you watch this you just might have to wonder I know I did what will be the last temptation of Christ? 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "This retelling of Christ's life features Jesus begging Judas to betray him only to be called a traitor in return Jesus building crosses for the Romans to crucify fellow Jews and British actors and voices all playing evil characters. Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ is despite and because of these things a brilliant film one that approaches closest to Christianity's core obsessions and problems. It also serves as a perfect palette cleanser for those who had the distinct misfortune of watching Mel Gibson's processing of Jesus Christ through the Hollywood meatgrinder for deeply disturbing personal reasons and money.But Gibson's dementia aside. Martin Scorsese's film is profoundly quiet and thoughtprovoking. Is it blasphemous? Or rather is the controversy it stirred justified? I'd say so. Paul Shrader the writer of the film himself admits that on a certain level the film is blasphemy. But not literally. It uses God as a conceit for man's condition and struggle to understand God. And this desire to comprehend which pervades the film renders its blasphemy a noble one. Or forgivable one. The film after all explores the relationship between the human and finite with the divine and infinite with a passion present in all aspects of it. The Last Temptation is about the struggle of those two particularly in the face of destiny and death. In that sense it is a very existential film. Dafoe's Jesus at first doubts he is even God's son. He doesn't know  he searches. He reaches false conclusions and true ones. The beauty of his struggle lies precisely in not always knowing the answers. He is after all human.And then again he is not. However on its own this statement means very little. The film probes the relationship of the Jesus of Nazareth who sins like the rest of us with Christ the son of God who is sacrificed for our sins. It explores the nature and meaning of that sacrifice. The segment that I would imagine caused the greatest amount of controversy namely not surprisingly Christ's last temptation provides the bridge between Christ and preChrist Jesus of Nazareth. It asks us to imagine Jesus being saved from death. And through this theoretical contemplation we see the necessity of the sacrifice its binding nature. Judas in fact summarizes this perfectly by saying The life of a man is not for you. Your place is on the cross I am paraphrasing but the point is there. Jesus' struggle throughout the film ends exactly at this point at this realization which allows him to say on the cross It is accomplished. The fact that this struggle is made real and accessible to us is what makes this a phenomenal film.The film's brilliance shines on pretty much all levels. Scorsese's direction is atmospheric extremely compassionate and restrained as opposed to the orgiastic explosion of unnecessary? violence in Gibson's film. The performances are great. Hershey's Mary Magdalene is amazing. Dafoe's Jesus and even more so Keitel's Judas are brilliant. In fact Judas in this film is almost as much a central character as Jesus. In The Last Temptation Judas isn't the evil traitor who gets himself killed over a maggotridden corpse like in Gibson's tale but a character so full of love he agrees to betray Christ. The act of betrayal here is one of coming to terms with fate very much on the same level as Jesus' acceptance of his selfsacrifice. Judas must betray Christ even though he has grown to love him.There are many reasons to see this film. It is a deeply spiritual examination of Christ the man and Christ the Son of God and the transition from one to the other. In some way it is a perfect portrait of a man's search for answers and for God  it is spiritual existentialism uncannily similar to Kierkegaard. It is the exact opposite of The Passion of the Christ and it should be celebrated.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Last Temptation of Christ has distinguished itself as one of the most controversial and misunderstood films ever made. At the time of its release in 1988 it garnered intense hatred from many religious organizations and civilian protestors. Fearing repercussions United Artists the largest theater chain in the country refused to show it. Most of this animosity did not come from offended audiences but from those who had not seen the film. In the some cases the opposition passed judgment only through speculation and hearsay. Quick conclusions and misinterpretations prevent the film from the true recognition and praise it deserves. The film must not be shunned or banned because of superficial complaints it uses the character of Jesus as a brilliant and thoughtprovoking illustration of the internal conflict of humanity and spirituality. The first of many complaints contends that the film depicts Jesus inaccurately. This complaint exemplifies the protestors' ignorance for they miss the film's goal entirely. The filmmakers clearly reveal their intentions in a message preceding the film where they explain that the film is not nor intends to be based on the Gospels but in reality is a fictional exploration of . eternal spiritual conflict'. To demonstrate this point the film uses the concept of fictional history a fictionalized retelling of true events and applies it to Jesus by changing events to make a point. Christianity teaches that Jesus is fully human and yet fully divine Nikos Kazantzakis the writer of the film's source material sees it as an incessant merciless battle between the spirit and the flesh'. Martin Scorsese using stark imagery and powerful compositions does his best to illustrate this battle. Together they have made Jesus in to more of a reluctant prophet than the Son of God. Rejecting God and yearning to human Jesus only accepts his own divinity after a great internal struggle. Detailing the hardships of acceptance displays the great will power that Jesus possessed and ultimately strengthens his character. According to many religious protestors turning Jesus into a fictionalized character for a movie and changing Biblical events to serve the story constitutes blasphemy. The First Presbyterian Church of Rowlett claims .the film 'The Last Temptation of Christ' is idolatrous and blasphemous and attempts to bring shame upon the person of our blessed Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.'.  The complaint of blasphemy is a fair one for the filmmakers themselves admit that it's true on a conceptual level. However claims that the film attempts to bring shame upon Jesus are completely unfounded. It may be considered blasphemous but the message illustrated by it only strengthens Jesus' character. To publicly proclaim the film as shameful with little or no attempt to understand intentions or underlying message of the film is not only wrong but also irresponsible. Screenwriter Paul Shrader explains that the mainstream media renders Jesus as an immaculately holy figure and nothing else. Shrader feels the image portrayed is far too onesided ignoring all human emotions he may have had. The film explores the human side of Jesus to reveal all the doubts and temptations he might have had doing this makes his final divine acceptance very meaningful. To illustrate the obstacles Jesus has overcome Scorsese must explore his temptations in the film  an area of powerful debate.   SPOILER   An extended portion of the film deals with Jesus while on the cross seeing what it would be like if he were fully human. We watch as Jesus imagines all the activities of a normal life including love marriage and children. In a particularly controversial scene in the reverie we see Jesus make love to his wife Mary Magdalene. Roger Ebert who gave the film his highest rating defends the scene This scene is shot with such restraint and tact that it does not qualify in any way as a 'sex scene' but instead is simply an illustration of marriage and the creation of children'. Again the protestors cry blasphemy and miss the point completely the film later reveals that Satan has fabricated the vision to tempt Jesus out of redemption. The controversial scenes in the dream are completely logical because the greatest temptation of all is something one cannot attain and for Jesus it is an ordinary human life.   END SPOILER   Viewers must not hastily condemn a controversial film without gaining a proper understanding of its underlining message. The Last Temptation of Christ conveys a very positive statement about faith and sacrifice. To denounce the film on account of the means of storytelling the film employs is shallow and irresponsible. The film may be guilty of blasphemy on the surface but the significance of the story is something people of any religion should appreciate.".

	schema:headline " Stunning And Passionate Variation On The Christ Story";
	schema:reviewBody "In ancient times Jesus Christ a lowly man from Nazareth tries to resist a calling from a voice he thinks is God telling him to preach a doctrine of freedom and love for God and one another. Ultimately however he fulfils this destiny but his cause prompts the Roman authorities to capture and crucify him martyring him for all time for the sins of mankind.Because any story about religious faith is an intensely spiritual and cerebral concept the Jesus story is hard to film the best adaptation is the 1977 Franco Zeffirelli  Robert Powell TV miniseries Jesus Of Nazareth and the best cinema version is the 1961 Nicholas Ray  Jeffrey Hunter film King Of Kings. This movie is not based on the gospels but rather on a novel by Nikos Kazantzakis which retells many of the gospel parables the sermon on the mount the stoning of Mary Magdalene the raising of Lazarus the moneychangers in the temple the tale of John the Baptist etc but with a radically different emphasis on character. Christ is very much a man in this movie full of fear doubt and selfpity struggling with the significance of his destiny and both Judas and Magdalene feature much more prominently in his story. It ends with a dream sequence in which Satan disguises himself as a child and tempts Christ on the cross with an end to his suffering and a dream of a life as an ordinary man with a family a temptation which Christ ultimately rejects. It is an extraordinarily powerful original and thoughtprovoking examination of Christianity which has at its heart the fundamental conflict between Christ the Man and Christ the God. It is also exquisitely made and passionately acted by a terrific cast. Dafoe gives a masterful performance in a role which is almost impossible to play and Keitel Hershey and Stanton all give tremendous support while Bowie is an inspired scenestealing piece of casting as the statusquoseeking Pilate There are threethousand skulls on Golgotha probably more. I do wish you people would go and count them sometime.. Brilliantly scripted by Paul Schrader with superb location photography in Morocco by Michael Ballhaus and a stunningly evocative score by Peter Gabriel featuring a bewildering variety of ethnic African and Asian sounds and musicians. Movies about religion are often turgid and bland at best. Upon this film's release however both it and Scorsese were vilified as blasphemous by many socalled devout Christians many of whom hadn't even seen it  ignorant halfwits one and all. This is arguably a great director's best and most personal film and it is a beautiful passionate intense intelligent and above all deeply spiritual work.".

	schema:reviewBody "Films about Jesus tend for all their possible individual cinematic strengths or weaknesses to preach to the converted. It is mostly a given that in a film about Jesus the truths of Christian faith must be accepted before you can appreciate what happens on the screen. Passion of the Christ is the ultimate example an act of faith more than an entertaining or thoughtful piece of cinema. Last Temptation of Christ is very different. The similarity between both films ends at the controversy preceding their release.The film shows us a tortured and uncertain man Jesus prone to visions and hallucinations a carpenter who lives a hard life in Nazareth he builds crosses and sees messihas die frequently and his childhood friend Mary Magdaleine is a prostitute. Already this smells more of artistic license than gospel quotes but it also rings truer and more brutally in keeping with the time than what is briefly summed up in the Good Book. The tense struggle between Israelite terrorists including Judas and Roman conquerors provides a violent background for this harsh environment. Out of this Jesus comes to interpret his voices as the call of God and is ushered on by Judas who sees in him not the son of God but a future independent leader for Israel. The misunderstanding between the two men is a wonderful contrast to their bizarre but strong friendship. As he gathers followers and takes on the role of Messia he finally confronts roman power and of his own will is betrayed and crucified. On the cross before finally giving himself completely to his cause he reflects upon what a normal life might have been like...Never has an embodiment of Jesus been so human or a film about him being so deliciously ambiguous. The wonder is that if you approach it with a slightly open mindyou will find it solid and appealing to your views as a Christian it can give a new dimension to The Son of God hence greater weight to his sacrifice. If you aren't a believer it is a good portrayal of a gentle but weak mind sinking slowly into insanity but through his conviction inspiring others. As a film there are many reasons why this should be recommended viewing despite some flaws Brooklyn accents and a blond Jesus Willem Dafoe and Harvey Keitel are an excellent screen duo and embody their respective characters with conviction and sincerity instead of being completely subdued by the role and religious reverence as is the case in most Jesus films especially Passion an unexpectedly good performance is given by a multilayered Pilate played by David Bowie. The direction is concise tasteful and elegant without being intrusive and Scorsese handles the more delicate scenes the miracles with a certain subtlety absent from most films on the same subject. The oftmentioned score by Peter Gabriel is perfect. Paul Schrader's screenplay probably deserves slightly more credit than any else's contribution for keeping a fair balance between the legendary and the more rational and historical aspects of the story. All in all this film should not be dismissed as wildly indulgent to either side in the eternal believeratheist debate but thoughtfully approached by all. Because in the end what matters is its qualities as a movie and they are to say the least significant!".

	schema:reviewBody "Usually when a movie about Jesus wants to point out that he was just a human being they stress the pain factor he feels pain like anyone else and is afraid to die especially in such a horrifically painful way. The Last Temptation of Christ points that out too but this Jesus isn't so much afraid of the pain as he is afraid of not ever living his life. That is where the last temptation takes place. In the last half hour or so of the movie Jesus is guided by a guardian angel and shown what his life would be like if he hadn't have sacrificed himself. It turns out that life isn't all it's cracked up to be and things end up terrible because he never died for peoples' sins. It's basically It's a Wonderful Life except instead of George Bailey never being born it's Jesus Christ never being crucified.I really loved this movie the way it was presented was amazing. It was so vivid and dreamlike you feel very up close and personal with Jesus especially since you can actually hear his thoughts. The acting is just great. Willem Dafoe fills Jesus' sandals quite nicely and provides a believable different angle of a Jesus who has fear weakness selfdoubt and seems to be making things up as he goes along. There are many complaints about Harvey Keitel's performance as Judas most notably the thick New York accent and many say it's the one thing that brings down the movie but I thought he was great. He's definitely the most interesting apostle since he actually betrayed his leader the movie suggests that Jesus was closest to him and he requested that Judas should betray him so he could fulfill his destiny on the cross. Hey ya never know.This is typical Scorsese mastery. It's a thoughtprovoking emotional film that will stick with you for a long time. Just try to remember it's only a movie and it's just offering a different point of view of Jesus Christ. And most likely a more accurate one too.My rating 1010".

This alone will rile many viewers but it does not bother me. My problem with this movie lies in an entirely different direction.May Contain SpoilersThis movie is a triumph of execrable writing pretentious dialogue and acting for which the word bad is entirely insufficient. After seeing Mel Gibson's brilliant Passion of the Christ with Semiticlooking actors speaking in Aramaic and Latin watching Harvey Keitel in flaming Irish red hair and Brooklyn accent play Judas was a real shock. There are other shocks in store such as a John the Baptist who rather than preaching repentance incites Jesus to violent overthrow of the Romans John's disciples who are either in the grip of religious ecstasy or crippling madness I found the three nude women swaying their heads in unison and mumbling incoherently to be particularly disturbing and one mindbending scene in which Jesus pulls out his own heart with one hand while holding an axe in the other.The movie's main problem is Jesus himself. Willem Defoe's Jesus is a wimpy crybaby. He could give Anakin Skywalker a run for his money I don't wanna be the Son of God! I wanna go to Tahashi Station and pick up some power converters!. And speaking of Star Wars references Satan's temptation in the desert seems to have been lifted from Darth Vader's Luke join me speech. Not that the effects budget of this turkey matched that of a Lucas filmSatan in that scene seemed to be a flaming gas burner buried just under the sand and turned up on hi. Jesus' selfpitying lines my God is fear etc ensured that I would feel no sympathy with this character.The cinematography was visually jarring and unpleasant to watch. The casting was woefully mismanaged. I have seen all the angloJesus films and a Brooklyn Judas and blonde bushybearded Midwestern Nathaniel would have been easier to take had not the supporting cast looked like they all came from Southern India! The heterogeneity of the cast torpedoed all suspension of disbelief. For the final insult Scorsese employs the ultimate narrative copout it was all a dream! Or a hallucination or whatever. I realize this was the ending in the book but the movie could have been something better. The purpose implicit in this piece of cinematic excrement is the desanctification of Jesus Christ by filthy dreamers who despise dominion and speak evil of dignities Jude 18 and I have no problem with that. My problem is that this is a Martin Scorsese film. The same guy who gave us Goodfellas and Raging Bull shortchanges his audience with this pretentious garbage. I expect better from a filmmaker of Scorsese's stature even if it is blasphemous a movie should be good! I am mystified by the praise lavished on this compost pile and I tell you truly polish a turd it's still a turd.".

No I'm not a Christian  though I can't fathom why one has to be a fanatic Biblethumper to hate this flick.For one thing let's set aside the fact that Jesus Christ is portrayed as a whiny meandering wimp while Judas Iscariot is portrayed as the only real man of the lot. That's the premise of the book after all and it's a valid artistic choice whether or not you can stomach it. It's not that far off Jesus Christ Superstar after all.In any event that isn't the key problem in casting Willem Dafoe as Jesus. The real plot hole is this does his portrayal give you the impulse to follow this Nazarene bloke to the nearest bus stop let alone suggest a charisma in him so strong as to engender a mass movement and a religion? Certainly not Dafoe can be called many things as an actor but his best friends are unlikely to include compelling charisma amongst his virtues.I'd say more but that would confer this turkey too much importance in my life and I'm only writing and voting on it out of a sense of cinematic duty.110.".

However this isn't the case.  The movie covers the span of Jesus' life from just before his baptism to his crucifixion.  The movie deals with several well known events from the gospels and kind of knits together a story that is partially from the gospels and partially not.  Clearly the story is based on the gospels.The film plods along at a snails pace you'll want to keep your finger on the fast forward button.  Some have commented on the nice score in the film.  I would recommend hitting the fast forward button when the music is playing.  With about 30 minutes of interesting content packed into 2 12 hours you aren't going to want to spend any more time watching this than you have to.  A weak and tormented Jesus unsure of seemingly everything he is doing manages to work himself through the events of the new testament.  Yawn  I think I have seen that story told about a dozen different ways now all of the others have been better than this one.".

	schema:headline " An Extraordinarily Powerful Presentation Of A Familiar Story";
	schema:reviewBody "If memory serves this movie stirred great anger among the fundamentalist Christian community when it was released and presumably still does. As an aside to those who like to caricature Christians it might be worth noting that fundamentalist Christians represent only a small portion of those who would claim the name Christian but they do get a disproportionate amount of attention  as do ultraliberal Christians for that matter. As a Christian nonfundamentalist non ultraliberal nonextremist and quite mainstream as one who accepts both the divinity and sacrifice of Jesus and the truth of the Scriptures I found this movie to be both quite moving and very challenging. As is pointed out in a disclaimer at the movie's beginning the story is not based on the Gospels except very loosely in the sense that many of the scenes in the Gospels are included up to and including the crucifixion but rather is a representation of the spiritual journey of Nikos Kazantzakis the writer of the novel on which this movie is based. The most controversial part of the movie is probably the last half hour or so in which Jesus is depicted as a man living in intimate relationship with two women both Mary and Martha  the sisters of Lazarus with children and eventually grandchildren living a comfortable and happy life. What the critics seem to have missed is that this was  as the title implies  Satan's last temptation to Jesus in a desperate attempt to get him off the cross  a futile attempt in the end as Jesus is clearly portrayed as having overcome the temptation. It is accomplished he cries from the cross. Some argue that this shouldn't have tempted Jesus because Jesus as divine was therefore perfect. But theologically Jesus' perfection rests on his ability to overcome temptation not to avoid it. Why would this last temptation be any more offensive than any other temptation  such as Satan offered him in the wilderness. Of course Jesus could be tempted. Of course Jesus could have succumbed to temptation  otherwise the biblical accounts of Jesus being tempted in the wilderness are pointless. The perfection of Jesus is displayed in his choosing not to give in to temptation when he could have chosen to give in to temptation.The portrayal of Jesus in the first two hours of the movie might have caused some angst  portraying as it does a confused and fearful Jesus struggling with God's call and uncertain how to proceed. Although Luke's Gospel does affirm that Jesus had to grow in wisdom. Hats off to Willem Dafoe for his portrayal of Jesus. I've never really been a huge fan of Dafoe but thought he nailed this part perfectly  perhaps the best film portrayal of Jesus I've seen. Harvey Keitel presented an equally fascinating portrayal of Judas Iscariot who is in a sense the hero of this movie in that he's the one who in the end jolts Jesus out of the temptation and back to reality. Another performance worth mentioning is that of Juliette Caton  the young actress who portrayed Satan pretending to be Jesus' guardian angel sent to take him off the cross. She was quite good in the role and presented to me a convincing portrayal of Satan  unthreatening innocent concerned. I've never seen her in anything else but based on this one performance I'm surprised her acting career doesn't seem to have gone much farther.What more is to say. It's interesting to compare this to The Passion Of The Christ a movie that also aroused deep feelings both for and against. I liked Passion. I thought it was a very well done account of the crucifixion which is what it was meant to portray. I have to say though that I thought Last Temptation was better. It's a superb movie that both challenges and deepens faith. It's a superb movie that flies by and that keeps you glued to the screen from start to finish. If Passion is a 9  which I voted it  then Last Temptation has to be a 10. It's the superior movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jesus is plagued by voices in his head and a pain he has that is so intense as to have him in spasms. He has tried fasting and selfharm but neither have worked for very long. He works as a carpenter one of the few who will make crosses for the Romans  much to the annoyance of his acquaintance Judas a Jewish rebel. Following an appearance by a spirit Jesus heads into the desert where he experiences temptations and ultimately learns the path he must follow. Returning to the real world he starts to speak and gains a following of loyal disciples who believe he is the Messiah. However for every follower he gets 10 enemies  mainly among the religious elite who see him as a heretic and lawbreaker.When it was released in cinemas and first screened on television in the UK this film broke all records for complaints and also had the moral majority ? up in arms over the controversy and the portrayal of Christ. Although I don't want to get drawn into that the reason I think they are wrong to complain is the same reason I think the film is worth seeing. From the getgo this film flies its fictional roots and never claims to be the gospel truth pardon the pun. However what it does is to think around the gospel to wonder to suppose to ask questions  something that millions of Christians do every day when they read the bible and contemplate on it. I'm not blind to the offence that this thought process could have but it still provides food for thought and like the author's quote says really puts some interesting ideas on the table in regards the dualities of Jesus as both a man and God.Although this makes it worth seeing in my book and held my interest and engaged my brain throughout this isn't to say it is brilliant because it isn't. It is overlong and rather plodding at times and could and should have lost at least 30 minutes from the running time to be a better film. The dialogue doesn't help that much at times but the delivery is good from a handful of great performances. Although most Christians are in love with Gibson's portrayal of Christ recently Dafoe goes deeper and more complex with a performance where he seems to totally understand the complex motivations that could have run through Christ  he is convincing as man and God and his though process is clear and engaging. He is helped by some great support. Specifically Keitel is great and helps bring out a Judas that is the opposite of the greedy failure we are told he is  instead he takes the second hardest job he makes it work really well and dominates his scenes. Support is also strong from Hershey Argo Been and Bowie yes even Bowie who all come over with smaller but impressive performances. Scorsese directs with deliberate movements at times but he matches the mood of the period that is well set by sets costumes and the cool ethnic score.Overall this is not a great film and if you have no belief or interest in Jesus then I cannot see why you'd bother to get through such a long film that lacks pace. However as spiritual food for thought it is wonderful and really engaged my brain  even if you rightly dismiss the film as fiction it is still useful as spiritual debate and providing a view of things that you can study out and draw from. Compared to the thoughtless cold and spiritually empty film by Mel Gibson 15 years later this is vastly better and worth seeing if you saw that.".

	schema:reviewBody "The struggles in reporting the news are shown in such an interesting way in the 1996 movie 'Up close and personal'. It also shows that a little bit of luck can help a person go a long way in an industry like that of TV journalism. This movie's story which has a strong and very emotional romance within it also has some surprising twists that I am sure people will not expect once they have watched it.Sally Atwater is fresh from a smalltown trailer park when she arrives in Miami overdressed and overeager to be the weather girl. He debut is disastrous but her boss experienced newsman Warren Justice admires her spunk and takes her under his wing making her an on air reporter. As Justice moulds Sally into one of the county's most sought after journalists the pair fall in love only to have their relationship threatened by the very success they have created.Here is one of the great romance movies I have seen in a longtime. I love the way that the main stars first meet and how their relationship develops. By the time that Tally is a great journalist what is more important than her career is the man that she loves that being Warren Justice. The screenplay for this movie was beautifully written by John Gregory Dunne and Joan Didion. I love how the two main stars are able to fall in love but at the same time able to do what they do as a career. Sure it might take a little while for the movie to show that this is important but I feel that the time needed to be taken so that both Tally and Warren fall deeply in love.The director of 'Up close and personal' was Jon Avnet who has been a part of some great movies such as that of 'Risky Business' 'When a man loves a woman' and the 'Mighty ducks' trilogy. In this movie I love the way that Avnet shows Tally Atwater at the start to be someone who is a struggler ignored and made fun of. Then to make her character be so vital and important in the whole makeup of the film was great. This I believe is the good work of Avnet and makes the movie all the more compelling. I also like the world that Avnet has created for the film that of the pressurised TV journalism environment.The stars of the movie are two of Hollywood's better known actors in Robert Redford and Michelle Pfeiffer. The pair have a good chemistry in this movie with the way that they fall in love very believable. I also like how Redford's character Warren refers to Tally at the start of the film saying that 'she eats the camera'. This scene shows that Warren not only likes Tally as a journo but as a woman as well. I also like the way that Pfeiffer appears in this film. She looks very much like a reporter does on the news and it is in her appearance that this needed to be so definite.The supporting cast of 'Up close and personal' is a pretty good one. I like Marcia McGrath Stockard Channing who is the tough as nails anchor girl who is pushed out of her position by the rising career of Tally Atwater. She treats Tally pretty bad in the film if the truth be known. I also like Joanna Kennelly Kate Nelligan who we find out is one of Warren's former wives. She is one of the reasons why Warren has had a turbulent journalism career. Do not discount the little role taken on by Tally's cameraman Ned Jackson Glenn Plumber. He is an incredibly brave cameraman who admires Tally for the work that she does. Trust me I would not have liked doing the camera work that he was doing in the prison.'Up close and personal' might not have the greatest of sound tracks but it does have one song that I really like. That song is 'Because you loved me' sung by Celine Dion. It is a song which was used well in the film and its lyrics suit this movie beautifully. How great a song this was made me want to watch the film all the more. By the way there is one scene in the movie that shows Pfeiffer's character singing 'The impossible dream' at an empty football stadium in front of Warren. All I will say about this is that Pfeiffer should stick to the acting game because she does not sing that well.This movie is such 'a good drama love story' because it shows how tough the 'TV journalism' area can be and does not shrug away from showing how difficult and dangerous such a career can be the prison scene is wonderfully shot and one of the great parts of the film. I also like how this movie concludes and I am not afraid to admit that it has gotten me upset both times I have watched it. You will notice that I say that Sally Atwater's name is actually 'Tally'. I will not reveal how this change happens just to say that I like it. I believe it was placed in the story for a bit of fun. But I am not so sure I would like my name changed for my chosen career. Would you?CMRS gives 'Up close and personal' 4 Very Good Film".

It's absoletely one of the most outstanding movie duet in the whole history of cinematografe. And some scenes make you heart stop for a moment like in the news room during the editing or when she came to say him that she is going to Filadelphia. I recommend it to everyone who crazy about romantic movies. And be ready to feel all spectrum of feelings with positive emotions.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is an updated review having just watched this film for the second time.In reading up on the film I learned it was supposed to be based on the life of Jessica Savitch a newscaster I remember quite well although I forgot how she died. I have a feeling the producersdirector were in a damned if we do and damned if we don't situation here. They were inspired by Savitch's life story but wanted to make a love story instead. If they just told the love story and weren't open about the Savitch angle they'd be criticized. If they made it clear the story came from the Savitch bio but didn't make it a documentaryfiction story they'd be criticized as well. They should have just shut up about where the inspiration for the story came from.I really liked the first third of this film and the last third of this film. The first third was great because it told the story of a wannabe reporter coming up through the ranks to become a respected reporter...led by her mentor Robert Redford...and throw in a bit of romance. The last third of the film was great because it was more about what hardhitting journalism can be. The problem is the middle third where the couple Redford and Michelle Pfeiffer seem to fart around in terms of getting a relationship going. I found that middle third to be rather boring. Were they going to go forward as a couple? Yes no yes no yes no. Jeez! Hence the 66.Now there are a lot of people who dislike the ending  if it's a romantic film why kill of a main character? If its a hard hitting story about the news why lean so heavily into romance?Perhaps the problem with the film is that when you begin watching it you think it's one thing  a romance story with some humor...but then it turns deadly serious.Another thing that would have helped would have been some timelines particularly in Tally's time in Miami. It was difficult to get a sense of how long it took her to go from desk work to weather to reporter etc.Redford's acting here is superb. Redford who was pretty much always at the top of his game was here also. Michelle Pfeiffer is very good and the problem with her character seemed to be a petty attitude...but after all she didn't write the script or direct the film. This is very much Redford's and Pfeiffer's film. Sure there are supporting actors but none that have memorable roles although their performances are all very good.It seems as if this film suffered from a bit of an identity confusion. But I still liked it. I just didn't love it.".

Robert Redford did a far better job in this flick than he has in most of his other movies. Pfeiffer and Redford seem to have great chemistry. This combination works well. I highly recommend this movie since a lot of information about what goes on behind the scenes in the news industry are highlighted. I am writing this review in 2005 and the issues we are dealing with in this era were addressed in Up Close and Personal which was made in 1996. Pfeiffer's character remarked that the news was based on what the sponsors wanted the one major complaint about the news media today is that it is corporateowned and corporate controlled. So we don't get the real deal when watching the news. We need PBS and Link TV to get the real news but mainstream media is exactly as Up Close and Personal portrayed it. Great job! Thank you Michelle".

She just strolls in and basically becomes his pupil. He believes in her. Right! The convenient circumstances begin to pile up in the first hour making the second hour quite unbearable. Just about the entire movie is implausible. It really meanders when they have Redford's character reporting on the war. The romance is so forced that there was never a chance for any chemistry to develop naturally on screen. I realize its a movie but I didn't buy any of the happenings for a second.".

When she says I was seven years and three dozen asses ago... you get a nice sense of their history.There is also a pretty good scene in a jail  Pfeiffer is doing a story and a riot breaks out.  Since this has nothing to do with the rest of the movie it works well.  But when a teary Michelle emerges without a smudge on her white blouse the movie quickly returns to its sorry state.To start at the beginning..Pfeiffer gets a job at a Miami television station.  She is overdressed awkward and clumsy.  He is dismissive sexist and condescending.  Naturally they are supposed to be together its cinema law.She moves up the television chain of command for reasons that are never spelled out.  Eventually she is a reporter and with his infinite help and wisdom a good one.  So good in fact that she is soon off to Philadelphia and the movie doesn't even get off a good joke at that city's expense! but since she is without her MAN she is faltering.  He comes to Her Rescue. This is so stupid so incredibly insulting to every woman that ever had a career and an ambition that its amazing Redford and Pfeiffer allowed themselves to be a party to such drivel.  No one loves Michelle Pfeiffer more than I do but its getting sickening having to tolerate her awful career choices.  When she is sitting with Channing in one scene Stockard might as well say WHY did you agree to do 'Grease 2'?  Even I turned it down and I was Rizzo in the first one!And they all have these RIDICULOUS NAMES!  Tally Atwater?  Warren Justice? The best of all  BUCKY TERRANOVA?  Who thought these up Vince McMahon? Jackie Collins?Pfeiffer wins one prize for this  most makeovers in a two hour movie. Every time you turn around she's dyed another color. No wait..Shirley MacLaine in What a Way To Go! would win that.  Sorry TALLY.  Ugh. 310.".

	schema:reviewBody "XANADU is one of the most critically and commercially panned films in Hollywood history a 'Nouveau Art' musical with Art Deco themes a weirdly conceived animated interlude and performances of such widely varying caliber that a viewer might wonder if the actors were all reading from the same script! But all that being said I would like to offer a minority opinion and say that I didn't find the film THAT terrible and there are some aspects of it I actually enjoyed...First and foremost it offers the legendary Gene Kelly in his last musical as charming and wonderful as ever. As retired musicianbusinessman Danny McGuire Kelly has the film's best moments including a 'classic' songanddance scene with Olivia NewtonJohn and some silly but endearing 'postdisco' routines with the talented young dancers of the cast including future CONAN star Sandahl Bergman. Seeing him on rollerskates again leading everyone around the club he builds to the music of the Electric Light Orchestra makes one realize just how irreplaceable he is. Kelly could do it all and with style!The premise of the film of a Muse coming from Olympus to inspire an artist is farfetched but had been done on film several times in the past ONE TOUCH OF VENUS with Ava Gardner and Robert Walker and DOWN TO EARTH with Rita Hayworth are the examples most often cited and while Olivia NewtonJohn is oddly cast in the role she tackles it gamely with a smile and a wink and isn't THAT bad. On the other hand Michael Beck bestknown as the gang leader in cliched but powerful THE WARRIORS is totally miscast as the artist she falls in love with. An actor with limited range and no singing or dancing talent Beck lacks the charisma to pull off the role one wonders why British pop star Cliff Richard who voices Beck's animated duet with NewtonJohn 'Suddenly' wasn't utilized to play the part.While the film often veers off in bizarre directions the 'Battle of the Bands' scene between popular 80s rockers the Tubes and a 'Tommy DorseyWWII'style orchestra as Beck and Kelly envision what the 'look' and 'sound' of their club XANADU should be actually works and is fun to watch. The entire score by Barry De Vorzon and John Farrar and Jeff Lynne with ELO is terrific and made the soundtrack album a hit.Sure the ending is hokey but it was also the same ending of ONE TOUCH OF VENUS and DOWN TO EARTH so XANADU can't be totally faulted!All in all XANADU isn't the WORST film ever made and if you give it a chance you might find it a guilty pleasure!".

	schema:reviewBody "Xanadu which has received some scathing onesentence reviews flopped in a big way at the box office and even helped inspire the creation of the Razzies is underrated. Not as underrated as that statement would normally imply but enough. The reason why it is underrated is similar to the reason why it stinks. Xanadu consists of two parts each of which can be divided into two parts depending on how successful each scene making up those two parts are.The first part is all dialogue in which Michael Beck Gene Kelly Olivia NewtonJohn or combinations thereof spend a lot of screen time talking about the importance of following one's dreams. The success of this part of the film depends largely on how tightly integrated it is with the musical part. When the male leads discuss music in particular it starts to fall flat as the artistic sentiment of a bygone era tries unsuccessfully to gel with the lowestcommondenominator mentality of what was then the present. The music sequences that fit in with this rule tend to suffer a lot too. The attempt to blend a 1940s jazz band with Electric Light Orchestra who were never really that representative of any culture even those of the 1980s is especially embarrassing. It dates the whole film beyond return.On the other hand when the musical and dialogue sequences are not connected to one another they work so well. Michael Beck's dialogues with the supporting cast about how his dreams of artistic freedom failed are brilliantly executed. The dialogue between Beck and Kelly in which the latter basically tells the former that quitting now will leave him with a lifetime of regret is pure gold. The conversation in which Beck's and NewtonJohn's characters argue with the voices of the gods performed by Wilfrid HydeWhite and Coral Browne works wonderfully in spite of the ludicrous costume on Beck. But the real gem in this flick is the climactic rollerdisco scene. I don't know how long it took them to coordinate and stage this myriad of sequences but the result was worth every bit of effort.Unfortunately the film is not without its problems. Many sequences are either boring or outright ludicrous. The animated part in particular fails to fit in with the rest of the film. Major rewrites began close to production as the producers tried to distinguish the production from other rollerskatingthemed films of the time. According to Olivia NewtonJohn the film was literally being written as it was shot and nowhere does this show more than in the final musical sequences of the aforementioned rollerdisco scene. It was as if the makers decided to put in as many shots of Olivia singing and dancing in as many costumes as they could. Perhaps the problem was in the editing as the aforementioned onthespot writing would have caused a problem with knowing exactly when to call it over. Truth be told it does stretch a little past its welcome if only by a few minutes. But then show me a film that is not guilty of the same offense and I will show you a masterpiece.Truth be told this film is nowhere near as bad as the IMDb rating would have you believe. It is not all that good either but it gets a little bit more right than wrong. Compared to excruciatingly bad musicals that take themselves far too seriously such as the recent Chicago adaptation this is pure gold. Hence in spite of a lot of problems I rated Xanadu a seven out of ten. It is a real guilty pleasure of a film and really needed more time in preproduction but it is entertaining for more than half of its running time which is more than I can say for a lot of other films. Especially of this genre.".

Even if the music and special effects are out of date now the style of the film is truly inspiring. I wont waste my time with the Xanadu haters.... But the people that love the film know what I'm talking about. Yes it's not Oscar worthy material but who cares? There is an entire generation of fans that love it for its simplistic magical wonder. The soundtrack is one that I've always rocked out too... I've owned it on record tape CD and even 8track!! You cant go wrong with the talent of ONJ or the creative ethereal sounds of the Electric Light Orchestra. The film has entertained me now for 25 years and it will for the rest of my life.

People need to understand that this is a MUSICAL and musicals aren't necessarily known for their great acting performances. They are noted for their brilliant choreography songs and stage settings which I felt both Moulin Rouge! and Xanadu contained. Moreover the story in Xanadu wasn't all that incoherent and reminded me a lot of Field of Dreams when Kevin Costner is inspired by a voice from an invisible muse to build a baseball field. So while some of the criticism of this film is justified I feel much of it is not and it took way more of a beating than it should have. One has to remember that there have been many films made which were raked over the coals by critics yet the films became enjoyed by many later on.".

	schema:headline " Xanadu is by no means the worst musical ever made.";
	schema:reviewBody "I have been a fan of ONJ since 1973. At that time she had already been in three movies. She was only 18 years old when she appeared in an Australian flick called Christmastime Down Under. In 1970 she starred in a film called Toomorrow a sciencefiction fantasy that involved alien abduction. Then in 1972 she was in a movie with Cliff Richard where she sang her latest record Banks of the Ohio and a duet with Cliff.Flash forward 8 years and history is repeated with Xanadu only this time Olivia is the star and Cliff joins her for a song Suddenly.Filming started on Xanadu with no script. All that existed was an 18page treatment plot summary and an overarching theme The Big Band Era meets the 80s Rock Era.Because everyone hired to work on the film was given this overall theme to work with they all went off to their respective departments and started working Set designers began designing sets location scouts went out looking for shooting sites costume designers started their work...and while all this was going on development of the script was largely ignored.The music was written and recorded long before what can be called the final script was written. On each day of shooting the actors were handed a few pages of the script that had been written only the night before. By the time principal filming was done and the film was assembled so many incongruities and inconsistencies in the film were apparent that scenes had to be rewritten reshot or cut entirely.Olivia was somewhat of a phenomenon by 1980. She was already named the most successful female recording artist outselling even Barbra Streisand. And she happened to star in the most successful musical film of all time Grease. At the time studios came at her from every which way offering handsome deals so that they could cash in on her enormous commercial appeal.The producers of Grease also approached Olivia with another project but Olivia's management balked at the money they offered. Allan Carr the more vocal of the Grease producers said of Olivia's refusal She's a pretty face but she ain't no Streisand. The film Allan Carr wanted Olivia NewtonJohn to star in was called Disco Heaven which was later retitled as Can't Stop the Music. Instead the lead role went to Valerie Perrine Superman The Movie. Her costars...none other than The Village People.Can't Stop the Music although not without a charm of its own is arguably THE worst musical motion picture of all time.Another strong contender for worst musical motion picture of all time would have to be Olivia's other film Toomorrow. The movie was produced by the same folks who played a role in creating The Monkees. Because The Monkees was such a moneymaking concept in the US producers felt they could repeat the success in England. While The Monkees were enjoying success on television in the United States Toomorrow also the name of the musical quartet would star in a series of big screen films in the cinema. Toomorrow would never enjoy such success. Their first outing lasted only a week in theaters before it was pulled from theaters.Perhaps its failure had something to do with the music. The songs and the singing in Toomorrow are poor. The only member of the fourmember group that does not sing off key is NewtonJohn. There is no choreography to speak of. Instead people dance in place and I must admit it is amusing to see NewtonJohn gyrate like Goldie Hawn did on LaughIn. Don Kirshner the man credited for having invented The Monkees The Archies and Toomorrow still holds the rights to the 1970 movie. He is rumored to have said that he will never allow the film to be released as long as he is alive. In fact during her own heyday Olivia refused to acknowledge she ever made the film. Today however she embraces it having recently hosted a successful and fun midnight showing of the movie.Many people feel the saving grace of Xanadu is its music. Critics said the only positive thing to say about Toomorrow was its special effects. For its time the special effects were cutting edge it was one of the first movies to incorporate CGI on film. Vic Kemper who recently passed away is the man behind the cinematography and special effects for both Xanadu and Toomorrow. Xanadu effectively put a huge black mark on NewtonJohn's credibility as a big screen actress Two of a Kind put to rest any doubt on the matter but I am glad that Olivia is still alive to see Xanadu and Toomorrow finally get the acknowledgment and recognition the films deserve even if their worth as works of art is found only in their nostalgic value.For a musical that had its songs written before the script the film came together nicely in the final analysis. And while NewtonJohn is no longer badmouthing the movie when asked costar Michael Beck Sonny is still bitter. He made a telephone appearance during a This Is Your Life program honoring NewtonJohn a few years back and his snide comments made NewtonJohn squirm in her seat.Gene Kelly never mentioned regret for having participated in the film although he did say something was terribly wrong with the way modern movies are made. God rest his soul.Sadly it was announced that another member of the Xanadu cast has passed away. Fred McCarren the young actor who played Richie Sonny's coworker artist friend died of cancer on July 2 2006. He was 45. God rest his soul.I am deducting two stars because the makers of this film should have known better than to start filming without a script.".

	onyx:emotionText "I have been a fan of ONJ since 1973. At that time she had already been in three movies. She was only 18 years old when she appeared in an Australian flick called Christmastime Down Under. In 1970 she starred in a film called Toomorrow a sciencefiction fantasy that involved alien abduction. Then in 1972 she was in a movie with Cliff Richard where she sang her latest record Banks of the Ohio and a duet with Cliff.Flash forward 8 years and history is repeated with Xanadu only this time Olivia is the star and Cliff joins her for a song Suddenly.Filming started on Xanadu with no script. All that existed was an 18page treatment plot summary and an overarching theme The Big Band Era meets the 80s Rock Era.Because everyone hired to work on the film was given this overall theme to work with they all went off to their respective departments and started working Set designers began designing sets location scouts went out looking for shooting sites costume designers started their work...and while all this was going on development of the script was largely ignored.The music was written and recorded long before what can be called the final script was written. On each day of shooting the actors were handed a few pages of the script that had been written only the night before. By the time principal filming was done and the film was assembled so many incongruities and inconsistencies in the film were apparent that scenes had to be rewritten reshot or cut entirely.Olivia was somewhat of a phenomenon by 1980. She was already named the most successful female recording artist outselling even Barbra Streisand. And she happened to star in the most successful musical film of all time Grease. At the time studios came at her from every which way offering handsome deals so that they could cash in on her enormous commercial appeal.The producers of Grease also approached Olivia with another project but Olivia's management balked at the money they offered. Allan Carr the more vocal of the Grease producers said of Olivia's refusal She's a pretty face but she ain't no Streisand. The film Allan Carr wanted Olivia NewtonJohn to star in was called Disco Heaven which was later retitled as Can't Stop the Music. Instead the lead role went to Valerie Perrine Superman The Movie.

I love musicals especially Kelly's and Xanadu really did not appeal to me  at all. It really isn't a very good movie. It has almost no plot at all and no real antagonist. What little plot there is I always felt was just lifted from Down to Earth 1947 with Rita Hayworth and Cover Girl 1944 with Hayworth and Gene Kelly in which he also plays a character named Danny McGuire which was a nice homage. The soundtrack is great though and it is nice to see that Kelly can still dance.Fast forward to 2006. I got a chance to see Xanadu again on a big screen. Specifically the wonderful Castro Theatre in San Francisco. The print was gorgeous and the crowd which filled the theatre almost to capacity was incredible. IT WAS SO MUCH FUN!!! The crowd really got into the movie and I just had a blast! What a great experience! The music is still great and it was a really really fun movie.Anyway  Xanadu still isn't a good movie but if you can see it under the right circumstances ie. on a big screen with an audience it is a great deal of fun.".

	schema:reviewBody "A word of advice to any movie producer if you have a bigbudgeted production that you hope will become a hit don't hire a director whose only previous experience is on TV. Director Robert Greenwald had directed only TV movie dramas before being assigned to this job and it shows painfully. The camera either stays still or moves slowly and gracefully when they should have flung it around and experimented with camera angles to create some oomph for the moviegoing audience to feast upon. The only department that really tried here was the art department that created the arty sceneshifts with the accompanying sound effects and the neoncolored special effects flashing around Kira and the other muses. Don Bluth also provided an animated sequence that offers the only magical moment in the whole film  makes you wish the whole movie had been made in the same style. That would have had so many advantages the whole superficial story would have been easier to take for instance. Michael Beck would have had a movie career and we would have been spared from watching OhI'msocutebutsopooratmovingmylegsaround Olivia in a second film or maybe not.That said I'm particularly ashamed to admit that I actually like Xanadu. Very much. The music is the main reason  years before I had seen this film or even heard of it I had heard Magic in the radio and managed to get a twominute snippet of it on tape thinking it was an Abba song I hadn't heard before no I'm not an Abba fan  they have a few good songs but I hate their albums. One day years later Xanadu was on TV in the hotel room I stayed at during a holiday in Sweden  and I happened upon the very scene where Magic is heard where Sonny meets Kira for the first time. Sadly I couldn't stay to watch the rest but I immediately wanted to catch the film from beginning to end. Now I have it on tape and I regularly pop it on my VCR and enjoy the pretty photography beautiful music and the irresistibly corny 1980 kitsch Xanadu is so chockfull of. A guilty pleasure of the highest magnitude  after all I'm a nostalgia freak and always will be one.".

What surprises me even more is how in its sheer misguided exuberance one can just giggle at the studio mindset that came up with the hilariously awful concept and resulting production. On one hand Xanadu is like passing by a car accident...you can't help but stare. On the other you have to celebrate the fact that it is indeed unique and that we will never see a musical fantasy extravaganza as bizarrely conceived again...hopefully.A mishmash of surreal foreheadslapping elements that never really congeal the 1980 movie's fanciful storyline centers on Sonny Malone a struggling LA commercial artist tired of recreating album covers on canvas for a record company. He is visited by Kira one of nine muses from ancient Greece who come to life from a Venice Beach wall mural set amusingly to ELO's I'm Alive. She inspires Sonny to partner with Danny McGuire a wealthy eccentric whom she may have inspired when he was a big band clarinetist with his own supper club in New York 35 years earlier. Together they decide to take the dilapidated artdeco Pan Pacific Auditorium and turn it into a roller disco club called Xanadu. If that doesn't sound preposterous enough the cardboard dialogue overdone Vegasstyle sets and cheesy special effects compound the absurdities exponentially.At her virginally pretty peak the florescentlighted Olivia NewtonJohn plays Kira in the same wideeyed manner she displayed as Sandy in Grease. That she is able to sing dance and skate with some ease is a pleasant albeit limited surprise. Looking like the lost Bee Gee a wooden Michael Beck is a blank slate as Sonny delivering lines as if playing a romantic lead amounts to an alien encounter. As Danny the 68year old Gene Kelly is simultaneously celebrated and humiliated as his character is ridiculously drawn in very broad strokes. He provides the film's one unequivocally lovely moment as he shows his stillfluid movements dancing with a uniformed NewtonJohn on the evocative bigband number Whenever You're Away From Me. Between her smooth singing and Kelly's softshoe dexterity it's quite magical. Unfortunately later on Kelly goes through a series of colorchallenged pimp outfits in the silly costume number set to ELO's toetapping All Over the World.But Kelly is not the only victim here as silly moments abound  a hilariously overdone 1945meets1980 musical fantasy extravaganza Dancin' featuring 80's rock band the Tubes and outlandish Solid Goldtype choreography and there are a couple of gooey pas de deux numbers between NewtonJohn and Beck  one amid rising palm trees and other props set to Suddenly and the other set to ELO's Don't Walk Away with the pair wackily transformed into fish and lovebirds in a Don Bluth cartoon sequence. The most spectacularly inane moments are saved for last  the tacky final production number with a splitscreen Kelly skating and NewtonJohn singing the title tune as she goes through a gamut of irrelevant musical genres and variety revue costumes.The pacing of this movie feels very off and the editing choppy as the 93minute movie alternately skitters and drags along coming to a dead halt with NewtonJohn's overlong number in Tronlike heaven on Suspended in Time. By the time the movie mercifully ends one feels the same way an audience member felt watching Springtime for Hitler in The Producers  utter disbelief yet an unexplainable giddiness about how ludicrously it was all presented. I have to admit some of the music is damnably catchy for example Magic. By the way I saw this movie not on DVD but on the big screen in a pristine print at the fully packed Castro Theater in San Francisco as part of a rollerdisco midnight madness program and the crowd went wild at every absurdity. I have no doubt that this is the optimal way to see this movie.".

I was collecting ELO albums since the age of 7 and I was about 11 when the movie came out which was not 1980 there was a bit of a delay the Target store which were around even then and looked the same they do today in Hurst Texas had the LP a whole year before the movie came out. Then it was shown on HBO for years after that. The music is done by Jeff Lynne one of the Traveling Wilburrys and ONJ some music done by the Tubes. It was at the end of the disco era and before the 80s era but the music and cinematography was not much different from early 80s stuff..The whole movie is like one long dream from beginning to end.. And somewhere in the middle is some original animation from Don Bluth. And much of the effects were inspired by the same backlitlightbox animation that was used in Tron Star Trek and the Jackson 5's Can You Feel It video.I feel sorry for the movie critics that took this movie too seriously..

	schema:reviewBody "I'll spare you the plot description as it's found on many semipro reviews here and is already wellknown. Instead I'll tell you about my own experience and how I see Xanadu myself. I'm not the least bit ashamed to admit I really love this movie. Always have always will. I'm just glad that for the past 30 years I was able to keep cynicism out of my life and watch it again by chance with pretty much the same eyes and spirit I did back in the day when I was only 11.Like many here I saw Xanadu when it was released which happened in 1981 here where I live. Me and some friends had set out to watch Clash Of Titans another blockbustertobe of the time. A boys movie. Instead we ended up watching Xanadu. A musical? Come on!!! For a gang of kids entering teenhood?? Give us the swords and monsters and the killing who cares about girls on roller skates and dance clubs! But We were there already so we watched it.What a pleasant accident! The rollerskating craze was in full swing and ONJ was a walking dream pure ear and eye candy. I was so much into roller skating that I used to sleep wearing mines so my bros wouldn't take it from me to ride. I wore them all the time even going to school. That alone granted me the nickname Xanadu which I confess made me proud c'mon I was 10  LOL because spoke about my ability on wheels. Eventually I got into roller skating big time then ice hockey inline skating and all forms of skating thanks in large part to this flick. I still skate a lot these days and I love it.We were young naive full of hope. And easy to impress. Xanadu is lighthearted pure innocent romantic. The music was catchy but very harmonic lifting exquisite. That's what a 10 year old draws from a movie. Not bad acting or stupid editing. I couldn't care less for big budgets shallow plots critic reviews. All I cared for was ONJ voice and angel face the skating the neon effects the fantasy the dancing. Like any 10 y.o. I wasn't into musicals but ELO and ONJ are irresistible. The whole vibe of the movie was and still is incredibly upbeat. I've become an ELO fan I get a lift every time I hear the soundtrack. I watched Xanadu again this past week on TV and was able to revive the same feelings and find the same joy. It almost made me cry I admit. I 've read over a 100 reviews and it's clear that everyone lover or hater agrees that Xanadu is far from a decently executed movie technically speaking. Bad direction silly plot stiff acting and all... But somehow the sum of all these bad parts result in something magic and special at least for many of us who lived those times. There are many forms of good. How good it was to be a teen at the 80's!I won't wax nostalgic and complain about modern life. I love modern life. But fact is things have become very formulaic very studied overly calculated. Not only in the movies but in general life. And still many great modern movies don't inspire like Xanadu. Don't last like Xanadu. It's like falling in love at teenhood you fall face planted many times but you'll cherish every moment forever. It's from a different era you had to be there to understand this and get a real grip on the movie. This uncompromise this daring ways it's all gone and lost but watching Xanadu brings back some of that feeling. Like most here I appreciate action movies highend special effects a tight story and firm direction a serious script. So I understand the critics I really do. I admit there are equally inspiring movies much better executed from that time. Many many. But how many movies better ones included went to the bin and never raised neither love nor hatred? So it could be worse it could be indifferent. But it's not. Even in its cinematographic mediocrity Xanadu is still passionate. It still clicks in its own incredible way. If you watch a movie as a succession of frames a tight hand at direction a logical connection of parts and that's a way of watching movies of course then Xanadu is not for you. But beware you won't be indifferent. That's impossible and speaks volumes about its magic.Thanks for reading and I wish you a good life!".

I shouldn't even be calling it a film because there's not much of anything resembling a story acting quality whatever to be seen in a single frame of this embarrassing disaster. OK the animated sequence was cool. But that's about it.And calling it a musical is also a putdown on the whole musical genre. XANADU is more of a series of incongruous elements and ideas the director and producers thought up most likely while on drugs and were haphazardly stitched together with no idea of what constitutes good storytelling in a musical format.The whole film is totally wonky.Case in point the fact that Olivia Newton John rarely sings on screen even though this is a musical and we hear songs sung by Olivia and yet Olivia is probably seen performing her songs just a couple of times on screen.Imagine hiring Julie Andrews for a musical for something like THE SOUND OF MUSIC and have her sing most of the songs but never show her perform her songs on screen.XANADU starts with the muses appearing from the painting all dancing and smiling to I'm Alive sung by...ELO?!?! Wait a minute. Wouldn't it have made more sense if Olivia had sung I'm Alive as she comes to life and dances about? I mean this is a musical right? And Olivia can sing right? But no we watch a silent ONJ try to dance with the other clunky muses while we hear the ELO song. This annoying technique or style don't know what to call it is repeated a couple of times during the film including the whole All over the world moment we watch Olivia grinning and silent while ELO sings.Then there's the whole 1940s  glam rock melding scene when we actually hear Olivia's voice on the soundtrack during the 1940s scenes but then whoa Olivia is nowhere to be seen. Instead we have these 3 unknown women who standin and lipsync to Olivia's voice. Why? That's Olivia's voice I hear so why not use her on screen?The whole Suddenly moment when Olivia and Michael rollerskate inside the magical studio. We basically watch these lifeless people rollerskate in some really cheesy setting while Suddenly sung by Olivia and Cliff Richards is heard on the soundtrack. Why? Why not have the couple perform the song to themselves? Just watching two people rollerskate to a song is like being on a porch and watch two people rollerskate in the street while Suddenly plays on the radio. How uninvolving is that?And the whole ending when Olivia sings on screen which makes you go wow it's a musical now but it's just a medley of pointless tunes sandwiched in between a truncated version of the song Xanadu. Huh?But the stupidest aspect of this musical is that Magic the best song of the whole disastrous project doesn't even figure prominently in the film.I could go on and on about how bad this film is bad fx annoying transitions ultra kitschy fashions even for that time etc but I think I've made my point of how truly embarrassing the whole thingamajig is by having a popular singer like ONJ in a musical and rarely have her sing on screen. So in closing should everyone avoid watching XANADU? Not if you're into train wrecks. It's a must see for those who love watching train wrecks and boy this one of the biggest train wrecks ever made. It's sorta so good because it's so bad because of its bad fashion sense and the overall look of it but the actors are so boring and lifeless that XANADU doesn't fall into the quotable campy bad films. XANADU's true camp appeal resides mainly on its wonky technical aspects songs script continuity logic etc and is a treasure throve of badness that will keep on giving for all eternity.".

I thought she was the most enchanting gorgeous woman on the planet. To be honest to this day no one I've seen on screen holds a candle to her except maybe Cate Blanchett. ONJ managed to be beautiful classy otherworldly pure sophisticated and incredibly sexy all at the same time. One does not see that in Hollywood anymore. The plot is silly the writing ridiculous and the male lead was not worthy of ONJ it's hard to beat the chemistry she had with John Travolta in Grease but the music is so fantastic you just have to stick with it. The choreography was ahead of its time as well. Ultimately if you didn't get this movie under your skin in the 80's you probably won't like it now. But give it a try!".

	onyx:emotionText "I cannot be unbiased about this movie. I was eight years old when it came out and I saw it in the theater. Olivia NewtonJohn was my first cultural icon. I thought she was the most enchanting gorgeous woman on the planet. To be honest to this day no one I've seen on screen holds a candle to her except maybe Cate Blanchett. ONJ managed to be beautiful classy otherworldly pure sophisticated and incredibly sexy all at the same time. One does not see that in Hollywood anymore. The plot is silly the writing ridiculous and the male lead was not worthy of ONJ it's hard to beat the chemistry she had with John Travolta in Grease but the music is so fantastic you just have to stick with it. The choreography was ahead of its time as well. Ultimately if you didn't get this movie under your skin in the 80's you probably won't like it now. But give it a try!";

The result may have been better appreciated in its own time but seems a bit silly now.  Olivia NewtonJohn stars as a mysterious woman who brings inspiration to artist Sonny Malone.  Screen legend Gene Kelly plays Danny McGuire a former musician with a dream of creating a great club.  This movie does have good imagery and interesting sequences.  Particularly the one in which Danny's big band vision combines with Sonny's modern rock vision.  Beneath it all is a message that speaks to creative types.

Unlike the usual formulaic production line fare that Hollywood usually cranks out  THIS film stands apart. It doesn't follow the same formula which so many do to get bums on seats. There isn't even a romantic subplot. Which i found VERY refreshing! Simply put this film attempts to explore moral boundaries ... Our own just as much as those of our onscreen protagonists. Unlike many people that watch this film I didn't come away feeling id been exposed to some 'liberal' or 'NWO' propaganda. Those reviewers seem to be suffering from a 21st century dose of 'reds under the beds' ...The setting of the film could be ANYWHERE  the fact that its in America with a Muslim 'villain' is merely a reflection of its intended audience and social environment. The point of the film is Is torture justifiable? How do you balance the morality of torture against its real world 'benefits'... ? The premise is A man has planted nuclear bombs in 3 American cities. He is in custody and the US security services need to extract the locations of the bombs within 72 hours. So they begin to torture the man.So how far do you go? Can you trust the information revealed? Who is 'good' and who is 'evil'? I don't want to spoil the film so will say there are many more variables which are featured ...Some people have complained about the 'gore'. Personally i didn't find it 'gorey'. Especially with the likes of the SAW films out there! There are some sequences which involve 'blood' etc but these are well executed brief and far from gratuitous. Much of the torture off camera as its the moral implications which are there to make you feel uncomfortable  not the visual ones.This isn't a traditionally 'enjoyable' or 'entertaining' film. However i was captivated from the opening scene and was intrigued throughout. Its well acted well scripted and well considered.Its a shame that many people will not take away what they could and should from this film  but that is a reflection of then  not a reflection of Unthinkable! 910".

Overall the film is very realistic and thoughtprovoking. While I completely understand why many assert that this is 137 minutes of protorture propaganda like the hit TV series 24 I completely disagree. I feel that more than anything it shines a spotlight on the human condition. It captivates the viewer and forces us to question how far we are willing to go to save lives and whether or not we are willing to sacrifice our vary humanity to do so. At what point are we willing to do the unthinkable and thereby give up some of the things that truly make us human? Warning this film is extremely graphic and at times hard to bear and while it is not for the fainthearted I still encourage every mature adult to watch it. I do not believe the extreme violence has been added for shock value or entertainment but rather to shake the hell out of the audience in order to make them reflect upon their humanity and what it means to be human.Also while I do believe that having yet another film depicting the bad guyterrorist as a Muslim does have the potential of perpetuating certain negative stereotypes about Islam and Muslims I feel that the bad guy could have just as easily been from any another religious tradition or political ideology and I did not consider it to be offensive or deliberately antiMuslim and I say this as a Muslim myself.I was thoroughly engaged till the very end and was left absolutely speechless staring at the screen. This was only the second time that has happened in my life and I am still absorbing and contemplating what I witnessed. FINAL RATING 910 hands down. A must watch film for every mature human being.

But it very strong stuff that poses some serious questions about a subject that I don't like to think about torture in the pursuit saving lives.Samuel L. Jackson plays a shadowy U.S. Government operative who will go to any lengths to get info from a terrorist  his plot to blow up millions of people on our home soil. Michael Sheen who memorably played David Frost in FrostNixon is that terrorist. CarrieAnne Moss is an FBI agent caught in the middle of their deadly cat  mouse.The movie's biggest strength is that we believe that Jackson's H is capable of doing ANYTHING to save innocent lives including the unthinkable. Jackson in words  action really sells the role. This is some the best work he has ever done. Sheen shows why he is one of the most sought after actors today. Moss is strong as the movie's moral center  a center that shows some very serious signs of disintegrating.The tension is nonstop. The script is often heavyhanded but for good reason. The direction is crisp  the editing sharp.How this went straight to video echoes the question why last year's best picture Oscar winner got such poor distribution.BE WARNED the numerous torture scenes are very tough to take. They almost cross over into tortureporn which I hate. I'm sure I hope the filmmakers had plenty of debate about how far to take the violence. My usual disgust with such scenes was balanced by the way they drive home the debate of a very troubling issue.I'm not ready to see this movie again anytime soon but I'm glad I saw it once.".

This is the sort of film that gets you thinking about your own moral grounds... how far would you have gone in order to save 1000s of lives. The story is simple realistic and very current which makes it really efficient. I do believe this sort of threat by a singlesmall independent group of terrorists getting hold of a dirty bomb is the one we should all be loosing sleep over. It does require a fairly strong stomach and will get some people uneasy with some of the torture scenes but this is exactly the purpose of the film. The acting by the lead roles is superb  both Jackson and Moss are playing at the top of their game. While the storyline is not likely to be politically popular and therefore I will be surprised if we'll see many awards headed up this film's way. Still hats off for memorable roles for both of them. I don't think that everybody can watch this film I doubt my wife could sit through all of it without some serious cringing. The subject of the film however is important enough to suggest that anyone who can tolerate strong violence on the screen should make time to watch the film. While enjoyable it probably not a good word to describe this film it is surely memorable and impressive.".

It's also a tense and thrilling ride as you watch the events play out.The cast all do a fine job with their parts and the direction is very good. Yes the film has some brutal scenes but it's all part and parcel to draw you in.It's not often nowadays that you watch a film and have to think afterwards to fully appreciate the fact that you've just been entertained and watched something good....and that's what 'Unthinkable' manages to do.

But I really feel it is the story and not just the actors portrayals that does' it. As many other reviewers here have already posted about the storyline not much to be said about that. I would just like to say that Our government is to be APPLAUDED for not somehow killing this film out've the gate. Also that any film makers in this day and age can still let you walk away with more than a thimble full of thoughts and feelings is to be greatly admired. I would like to add to the entire cast's credit that all the acting was extremely credible. My only quip with the entire film was the ending which left me almost screaming at the screen. I have seen almost every horror film that exist's .... This is the real horror of our time  I would strongly urge only the most Stout of heart to actually view this. And only the intelligent. Kids need to be old enough to understand world events if they see it. Again this is one thought provoking film that DOES'NOT insult any ones views Muslim or any other god fearing person. Or any other atheist like myself. It merely shows what extents the human race can reach when called upon in an extraordinary situation. 910 which could have easily been 1010 had the ending not slapped me around a bit ...".

A number your people kill every day and I choose to meet my oppressors to their faceThis film wasn't condoning torture in fact it was asking us a questionWhen do we stop being human beings? While yes the person named younger was technically a murderer in this film he was not the bad guy. He took lives but as he clearly stated he says he's just in what he did as though trying to prove a point. That as a nation today we are so scared of what may happen we give up not only our own rights but the rights of others and allow things like torture to happen. Yes it is sad and a horrible thing to take lives but what younger reminds us....who are the real monsters? If you add up the total deaths caused by younger its unknown. 53 to start out with and a potential 10 million based off of shaky evidence that they could never prove he had nuclear weapons not even at the end. C4 yes. bombs yes but still no proof of nuclear. I think younger more or less decided what he was doing was more revolutionary than terrorlike. As he repeatedly stated how much he loved his country and he's an American citizen. While H played a bad role here we can not forget that H said he himself was like a prisoner here his acts were encouraged every step of the way and when they weren't all he had to do was wait and then he was asked for again to do what he was just told to stop. In my honest opinion this movie is asking us to take a long good hard look at our values. And realize that under a moment of pressure they really don't mean a g  thing. That's the problem with not just America but the entire world today. It's a wake up call. All younger wanted was peace. He asked that US stop funding puppet regimes fake terrorist and pull forces out of Muslim Nations. There was nothing wrong with what he asked for. It was what he did about it that was wrong. I am in no way supporting terrorism or its acts BUT IN THIS MOVIE the real terrorist is the guy who tries to shoot H at the end for not continuing the torture. In H's twisted mind he was just doing his job. Younger was just trying to gain peace ironically through the threat of destruction and Brody finally breaking down decided to end it all when H said if you can do it than anyone can.Brody is still human H is neutral and everyone else there who wanted to continue were the real monsters.Don't agree? Fine I'm not asking you to remember I apparently still live in a free country. 9 out of 10 because i don't like torture or killing people. But the movie had a meaning.".

This film engages in classic manipulation 101 by affirming and propagating some problematic cultural assumptions as facts then blanketing over them with cinematic devices of distraction and sleightofhand.The distractions are the Alist stars who attached their names to this film and the performances they give without which the glaring holes and gaps in the plot and character motivations would be blatantly apparent. This is evidenced by a number of reviewers here who professed that they were on the edgeoftheirseats and captivated by this thriller despite the fact that they didn't understand why Younger did not seem to anticipate that his wife and children would be used as bargaining chips when he supposedly anticipated almost everything else or why Younger would turn himself in and risk the discovery of the bombs. These reviewers make the people who think that this film is somehow antiAmerican come across as slightly sophisticated because I am fairly certain that actual militarycontractor interrogators who should understand that physical torture is a limited and only one of many interrogation technique would find Jackson's character and his persistence on physical torture when it is clearly not working to be absurd and laughable. These reviewers are under the impressionmanipulated by the film to thinkthat the film is about some moral reflection on whether torture can be justified if the situation is dire enough. This is not what the film is about.This film is about melodramatizing certain assumptions and rendering them compelling and believable enough to be taken as fact. One such assumption is that only 'terrorists' face the possibility of torture in the name of US national security which is a neat sleightofhand to obfuscate the fact that the majority of people who have actually been imprisoned and abused in the War on Terrorfor example in places like AbuGraib Guantanamo Bay and other 'black sites'are not guilty or even charged with any crimes related to 'terrorism.' But questions about how entire categories of people have become disposable in the name of security is blanketed over by the film which tells the audience that the only question we should be concerned about is whether we should prioritize morality or survival when confronted with the ticking timebomb scenario. How did this 'scenario' come to be? It doesn't matter the film tells us because the antagonist is Muslimas if that explains everything. What it explains is the other assumption the film affirms that the writers and the producers hope no one will be conscious of which is that all Muslims are 'suspect' and 'they' hate 'us'an assumption that slides perfectly into a dominant cultural explanation for '911' and the subsequent 'War on Terror' as evidenced by some threads in the IMDb message forum where some posters have parroted all the tiresome rhetoric we've all heard countless times from government and military officials talking sock puppets and films.There seems to be a 'commonsensical' notion floated by numerous reviews that something can be cultural 'propaganda' only if it can be easily recognized as such. If it's easily recognized as such then it no longer fulfills that function. And the fact that so many people were entertained by this film without an inkling of its pedagogical function is a clear indication of the intensity of its manipulation.".

	schema:headline " Good performances horrible writing gratuitous violence and not really about current torture debates.";
	schema:reviewBody "Good performances horrible writing utterly brutal and for no good reason. Unthinkable was utterly ridiculous in many ways. It was NOT in fact contributing to the torture debate it was addressing how people might react in a worst case scenario. I think there are people who would feel differently about torturing a person who has admitted to setting nuclear bombs that would kill millions of people in three days time than torturing suspected terrorists who might possess information on possible future terrorist actions. No matter how you stand on the matter I think most people would agree these two very different situations warrant separate discussions. This movie is the political version of Armageddon The Day After Tomorrow and Zombie World though Zombie World had far better writing.Samuel L. Jackson rocks as usual but his character is as monstrous as you'd expect. Though he makes a couple OK arguments in his defense. It's more difficult to judge his actions because we see him in an extreme worst case scenario not any of the real life situations that drive the current torture debate. If it had dealt with some of these situations the extreme violence may have been used more legitimately. As it is the violence here is gratuitous and revolting.To me the film ultimately came across as very one sided though I suspect this was not its intent. The biggest problem was the failure to make YusefYounger sympathetic in any respect. The actor Michael Sheen has an incredibly emotive face and good acting skills but the character was just a wretched excuse for a human being and was given no back story to explain his actions. He was written too flat and while I think there are interesting things about him which I will go into in more depth momentarily I think these characteristics are accidents the writers have him act in ways to progress the plot rather than writing out the character and having the plot evolve from him. This is a typical problem with poor writing. The writersdirector try to get the audience on Yusef's side by making his demands reasonable and stating that he loved his country. But in order for a person to be reasonable his tactics must also be so. And setting up nuclear bombs to kill millions of people is simply not a reasonable. Yusef is also a narcissist. The action is all about him. He is a lone wolf not working with any legitimate or terrorist organisation. It is his demands. Yusef is proud and believes he can fight a just war and right some major wrongs all on his own. Add stupid and naive to the list of character traits as well. Finally Yusef's lack of empathy made it hard to empathise with him. The children he murdered at the mall were martyrs but when it came to his own children he gave up his convictions to save them. While this may seem like an appropriate fatherly reaction this made him a hypocrite. If he had allowed his own children to die at least the audience could find some respect for him. But as it is he caves. A true appropriate fatherly reaction would have allowed him to empathise with the fathers of his victims and thus be horrified at his own actions. There is no visible sense of remorse at all in Yusef. There are two instances in the film where other characters suggest that he may not have been the best father and husband. Again his actions regarding his children at the end may be more about himself and things that are his than about any true humanity within him. It is a similar logic framing his reaction to the wrongs done to his country and his religion. Offences against his things warrant extreme measures i.e. killing millions or abandoning his ideals. It might have helped to sympathise with him if the audience new somethings about his conversion to Islam and his experiences in the Middle East. We are given no details about what particularly is bothering him so much as to legitimate in his mind the murder of millions. As it is he's just some ahole who didn't like Middle East policy so he decided to blow innocent people up. In the end I wanted them to kill his wife and kids just so maybe I could feel something for the character. But honestly as disgusting and horrifying as the torture was I kind of just kept thinking that the character himself was a hypocritical narcissistic bastard with no empathy for other human beings and who was going to murder millions of people. Making the terrorist a Muslim was a desperate lame attempt to make the movie politically relevant. He may as well have been a zombie terrorist might have made the film more interesting. Ultimately the movie was poorly written unnecessarily violence and bloody and rather irrelevant.".

	schema:headline " Controversial concept misses its chance to excel.";
	schema:reviewBody "Unthinkable raises a question which has been an issue for many people all over the world for a very long time and especially since 911. This question is is it ever justifiable to torture an individual to save the lives of many? And if the answer is yes how far can you go?This issue is indeed a very sensitive subject and I think it takes guts for any filmmaker to put it out there in the open like Gregor Jordan did. Add to that the clever fact that he doesn't actually make a choice but rather lets the audience decide on whatever they want to think and feel and you have a pretty gutsy and controversial concept.In a nutshell this film is about a man of American descent who has become a Muslim and has now as an act of terrorism planted 3 nuclear bombs in 3 major American cities which will go off in four days. Screenwriter Peter Woodward made some very tactical decisions considering the characters in the story. They are all somewhat stereotypical but this is no bother because they're all there for a reason. CarrieAnne Moss as an FBI investigator represents the conscience the sensitivity and the struggle to make the right decision. Samuel L. Jackson is her polar opposite the brutal rational stone cold interrogator who does what he does because he's the only one who can and willing to do it. The means he is willing to go to in order to get his subject to talk are almost as unwatchable as they are unthinkable. This is quite possibly the most gruesome film I have ever seen but that mostly has to do with the fact that the things you see are in fact very real. This stuff does happen and it's way harder to stomach than any slasher horror movie because it sucks you in emotionally. Intelligence agencies and secret services the world over DO use these techniques whether we like to believe it or not.All of this sounds like a great opportunity to address a major issue and stimulate people to really think about it doesn't it? One would like to think so alas there is one big problem bad writing. As hard as they try the filmmakers do not at any point manage to evoke sympathy on either side of the fence. Not with the terrorist for the complete lack of background and motivation but neither with the people who try to stop him from executing his horrible plans that could claim the lives of millions of people. Especially CarrieAnne Moss' character Brody is quite a pain in the butt because even though her struggle is understandable quite simply because she's a decent human being she comes off as kind of naive because she  from a professional point of view  is unwilling to sacrifice the life of one to save millions. Her constant interference gradually becomes increasingly annoying up to the point that you just want her to get out of the way. However Jackson's character H. turns out to be such a volatile psycho that you almost start to feel sorry for the terrorist! There is one scene in particular which throws you off so badly that you really don't know what to think anymore. I'll only say that it involves the terrorist's wife and as much as I would like to warn you I don't want to give any spoilers but you can take it as a warning anyway... It'll make your skin crawl. The rest of the characters are about as lively and relevant as cardboardcutouts I've already forgotten about most of them but they don't really matter to the story anyway. However all of this could have still turned into a decent film if it wasn't for one major flaw the horrible ending. It's so incredibly hollow and unsatisfactory that it leaves you wondering why the hell you just spent an hour and a half watching a man being tortured if there was absolutely no point to it?! It could have been worthwhile if only the filmmakers had any resolution to offer but there is none. Why did the terrorist do what he did? We don't know. Did the agents accomplish anything? Not really. So what's the point? There is no point. It's just 90 minutes of torture bad decisions and failure. That's it. Overall it's not all bad. There is some really good dialogue and despite aforementioned flaws and inconsistencies in the script there are a few really good scenes which do involve one into the minds of the people on screen. The actors do the best they can with what they're given Samuel L. Jackson is as reliable as ever and CarrieAnne Moss is convincing in her role which makes me sad to think that since The Matrix and Memento she hasn't really had any memorable roles and that's too bad because she is a good actress. Michael Sheen as the terrorist is good too though it's hard for him to make his character a 3dimensional human being because the writers offered him no history or character development whatsoever but he definitely makes his character's inthemoment emotions work from scene to scene.So final conclusion. I wouldn't really dissuade anyone from watching this film you now know what to expect and it does offer some interesting food for thought here and there but you should really understand that this film is pretty challenging mentally as much as physically. And don't watch this if you're under 18. Seriously.".

	schema:reviewBody "Early on this film treats you to a visually explicit depiction of a US torturer cutting the fingers off a man things gradually worsen as the story progresses. Yet this inhuman cruelty pales in comparison with the moral depravity and intellectual sadism of the writer and director. This film has a realistic veneer but the plot is based upon the most unlikely and ludicrous not to mention insidious of conceits. Specifically there has never been one single verified instance in the whole history of mankind nor in the 12 year history of the War on Terror when the fabled 'Ticking Bomb Scenario' has ever existed.In case you have never had your brain abused by the sound of US lawmakers justifying torture the Ticking Bomb Scenario is their favorite. This is a fictional scenario wherein US authorities have a verified terrorist in custody and simultaneously happen to know that unless they can squeeze info from said terrorist in a short time span hundreds thousands or millions of people will be killed by that terrorist's plot.There are multiple problems with the Ticking Bomb Scenario such as the unlikelihood of authorities simultaneously having a genuine terrorist in custody that they genuinely and verifiably know has the information they want concurrent with verifiable knowledge that a mass terror act is about to occur. On top of that you have to be able to verify the info the terrorist tells you otherwise he could lie when they torture him. And if they can verify that what he confesses is the truth then why did they need to torture him anyway? The relevancy here is that the writers had to construct a reality in which the Ticking Bomb Scenario is possible. This results in a plot that is ludicrous.Not to mention Carrie Ann Moss plays an FBI interrogator with the interviewing skill of Barney Fife. So obviously nontorture interrogation will not work in this world.Worse the plot serves so as to justify Samuel L. Jackson performing the most odious and vile tortures with hapless Carrie Ann Moss forced to watch and enable such depravity.This film is full of damned lies and disinformation that go unchallenged and these damned lies are too numerous to list in this review. One of the worst lies however is when Samuel L. Jackson says that torture has been used effectively throughout history to obtain information.In fact torture was invented as method of intimidation and was not used with the intent of gathering intelligence until the last 200 or so years or so. Unless you count false confessions if you want someone to confess to a crime he didn't commit yes torture works. Moreover there has not been a single verified instance where any information obtained by torture has saved one single human life.The Nazis for example tortured prisoners extensively in WWII for intelligence yet were completely surprised by DDay even to the extent that General Rommel was far from Normandy celebrating his wife's birthday when the Allies landed. If torture yielded intel then nobody should have ever been able to surprise the Nazis. Yet the Allies did again and again and again.The Catholic Church used torture extensively during the inquisition but what that yielded was false confessions and fables of witches and demons. Nothing in the way of 'actionable intelligence.' The Romans were masters at the art of torture but they didn't use it for intel. No they used on rebels such as Sparticus and his slave army and they left their tortured bodies along the road to discourage others from revolting.So yes torture has existed for ever but it has never saved any lives.Carrie Ann Moss and Samuel L. Jackson are forced to make heavyhanded and absurd speeches justifying and condemning torture. The filmmakers appear to desire one of two results 1 Conservative viewers who already favor torture will come away from this film secure in their resolve that torture is necessary to protect America from Muslims. And yes this is film is sufficiently antiMuslim for Glen Beck to show it at his next rally. 2 Liberals viewers will be less secure in their belief that torture is wrong.As we have seen since 2003 once we began to debate the possibility that torture might be an acceptable tactic we were lost. Pragmatically as well as morally.In an America that is steadily becoming more violent more murderous more sadistic more paranoid and more bigoted there is no need for such a movie as this. There are no lessons in this movie only incitements to and justifications of sadism. This is the most vile piece of cinema I have ever seen.".

Nothing in the way of 'actionable intelligence.' The Romans were masters at the art of torture but they didn't use it for intel. No they used on rebels such as Sparticus and his slave army and they left their tortured bodies along the road to discourage others from revolting.So yes torture has existed for ever but it has never saved any lives.Carrie Ann Moss and Samuel L. Jackson are forced to make heavyhanded and absurd speeches justifying and condemning torture. The filmmakers appear to desire one of two results 1 Conservative viewers who already favor torture will come away from this film secure in their resolve that torture is necessary to protect America from Muslims. And yes this is film is sufficiently antiMuslim for Glen Beck to show it at his next rally. 2 Liberals viewers will be less secure in their belief that torture is wrong.As we have seen since 2003 once we began to debate the possibility that torture might be an acceptable tactic we were lost. Pragmatically as well as morally.In an America that is steadily becoming more violent more murderous more sadistic more paranoid and more bigoted there is no need for such a movie as this. There are no lessons in this movie only incitements to and justifications of sadism. This is the most vile piece of cinema I have ever seen.";

Sooner or later our enemies will attempt to destroy one or more cities with nuclear devices. Where these bombs will come from and who will build or steal them isn't clear. However the desire of America's enemies to do so is very real. Type 'Nuclear Terrorism' into Google and you will find a wealth of material on the subject.Indeed Islamic terrorists have already engaged in nuclear terrorism. See Nova Dirty Bomb for a history of dirty bomb incidents some of which were actually industrial accidents. Note that the relatively complete list is missing one industrial accident in Mexico that resulted in uncontrolled nuclear material entering the U.S. see Contaminated Rebar from Juarez.However the focus of the movie isn't on the details of how terrorists might steal nuclear material or fabricate a nuclear device. Indeed the technical details in the movie aren't realistic. Building a workable bomb is far beyond the capabilities of one man no matter how well trained.The movie is about how many moral and ethical lines we will cross to stop such a disaster. The principal character played by Samuel L. Jackson appears to be willing to stop at nothing. Other characters have lines at the outset but they find their own lines blurring as the crisis escalates. In the end it isn't clear if anyone has any lines that they won't cross to stop the Unthinkable.Note that the Wikipedia page spoiler alert discusses an alternative ending that was part of the movie that I saw. Apparently the U.S. DVD and Bluray version does not include the highly relevant last few seconds.An interesting question is why this movie didn't reach theaters. The cast is highly regarded and the movie is better made than much of what is actually showing.

Does she really need to see the 53 people killed in order to grasp the concept of a bomb and change her mind? And how come she cares about 53 people but later doesn't care about millions getting killed? In order to present the moral dilemma they should have used a stronger character  one that doesn't change her mind all the time and that gives better dialogs than you can't do that and it's not alright.
