So lets get this clear if your looking for any sort of historical accuracy LOOK ELSEWHERE! For handwringing political correctness BEGONE! The Colonial Settlers are good the Indians bad and the British are incompetent thats it. If you are expecting dialog by way of Hamlet thats not going to be here either. Like Harrison Ford said about George Lucas You can write dialog like that but we can't say it.The fun of this film is to watch it unfold in all it's glorious Three 3 Strip Technicolor and follow the adventures of Paulette Goddard with Gary Cooper as they move from one 1 set piece to another. For thats what this film is as series of set pieces. Or as what some critics of DeMille felt he did not make motion pictures but moving paintings though very entertaining ones.The Perils of Paulette is what the critics referred to this picture upon its original release. I think very few actresses were put upon more then she was in this movie. She was bound chains rope or leather almost whipped almost burned at the stake almost drowned going over a waterfall almost raped etc. If this had been a precode film I am sure we would have seen something like the excesses in 'THE SIGN OF THE CROSS'! It would have been interesting to see what ended up on the cutting room floor that could not make it past the censors. Supposedly during filming she blew up and walked off the set until DeMille could bring things down to an acting or pain tolerance level referring to DeMille as a SADIST! DeMille liked troopers such as Barbara Stanwyck and did not forget this. When Paulette wanted the role of 'Delilah' DeMille told her to take two 2 drop dead pills and effectively ended her career. When the 'UNCONQUERED' was finished CB issued gold medallions to those he felt were real troopers. Boris Karloff got one 1 and the drummer boy for not flinching when a ball of fire bounces off his drum not Paulette.When you watch a Cecil B. DeMille film the important thing is not to take it seriously and just enjoy the ride. There are alway some neat things that you can pick up. Though he plays fast and loose with history most directors do to this day Michael Moore Oliver Stone he gets a lot of details right. The firearms swords uniforms even the shape of the British star fort are all right on. There is also excellent attention to detail on the day to day life of this period of history. He did build his films from the ground up and if did not convey historical accuracy gave a good imitation. Sort of a 1940's version of virtual reality. It looks great but is not all there.".

Paulette still the redheaded beauty does some decent acting for a DeMille film and Coop can still play the hero.  Only time they appeared together prior to this film was another DeMille film years earlier NORTHWEST MOUNTED POLICE.

	schema:headline " Mediocre history but some nice moments.";
	schema:reviewBody "Cecil B. DeMille had been doing a series of films about American History from 1937 THE PLAINSMAN to 1940 THE NORTHWEST MOUNTED POLICE  although actually it was a film regarding Canadian history instead. His two film in World War II were THE STORY OF DR. WASSELL which is a war picture set in the far east  but dealing with an American war hero and REAP THE WILD WIND set in the Caribbean but dealing with pirates attacking our merchant marine in the 1840s. UNCONQUERED dealt with a period that he had not covered  the pre American Revolutionary period. It would turn out to be his last historic film about America unless one looks at THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH as a view of part of our theatrical and cultural history in 1950. His choice was curious  he might have done a film on the fall of Quebec and deaths of Generals Wolfe and Montcalm or a film on the American Revolution. Instead he chose events in 1763 just as the split between England and the colonies began to develop. But the events deal with the situation that led to what is called the Conspiracy of Pontiac where an intelligent Indian chief united many of the tribes in the Ohio Valley to revolt against American settlers and British troops to preserve it for the Indians. The result was that many settlers and Indians were killed before the fighting ended and Pontiac was killed. That is the story but most is jettisoned for a fictional account of events in the Ohio Valley. The villain is Howard De Silva intent on keeping out the colonists by arming the Indians so that he could have a monopoly of the fur trade. He is also responsible for illegally bringing Paulette Goddard into the colony of Virginia as an indentured servant. Gary Cooper is the man opposing De Silva in his plans regarding the Indians and his plans regarding Goddard. The film is not DeMille's best but it's Technicolor De Silva's performance the appearance of Boris Karloff as a villainous Indian he would play an Indian again a few years later in TAP ROOTS and the two leads make it entertaining enough. But my interest in it deals with two supporting roles. Porter Hall is Mr. Leech who is bribed although he is aware it is a hanging offense to send the pardoned Goddard to the colonies as an indentured servant. He's not in much of the film but it is a nice performance. But better is Mike Mazurki. The exwrestler was not an actor but occasionally turned in first rate performances such as his lovestruck thug in MURDER MY SWEET and Joan Blondell's boyfriend and moral superior to Tyrone Power in NIGHTMARE ALLEY. Here he is a minor villain  a thug for De Silva. For most of the film he is doing De Silva's dirty work without a thought. But at the film's conclusion he is faced with a moment of truth. De Silva Cooper Goddard and Mazurki are trapped in a cabin but have weapons to protect themselves. Cooper knows that troops will be arriving soon to rescue them. But De Silva is deluded into thinking he and Mazurki are safe because they have been arming the Indians  he's ignoring that as a white Englishmancolonial he's as hated as the others. He tells Mazurki to open the door and signal the Indians to let them go. Mazurki showing a commendable intelligence refuses. De Silva orders him again and then he decides to do it himself.

	onyx:emotionText "Cecil B. DeMille had been doing a series of films about American History from 1937 THE PLAINSMAN to 1940 THE NORTHWEST MOUNTED POLICE  although actually it was a film regarding Canadian history instead. His two film in World War II were THE STORY OF DR. WASSELL which is a war picture set in the far east  but dealing with an American war hero and REAP THE WILD WIND set in the Caribbean but dealing with pirates attacking our merchant marine in the 1840s. UNCONQUERED dealt with a period that he had not covered  the pre American Revolutionary period. It would turn out to be his last historic film about America unless one looks at THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH as a view of part of our theatrical and cultural history in 1950. His choice was curious  he might have done a film on the fall of Quebec and deaths of Generals Wolfe and Montcalm or a film on the American Revolution. Instead he chose events in 1763 just as the split between England and the colonies began to develop. But the events deal with the situation that led to what is called the Conspiracy of Pontiac where an intelligent Indian chief united many of the tribes in the Ohio Valley to revolt against American settlers and British troops to preserve it for the Indians. The result was that many settlers and Indians were killed before the fighting ended and Pontiac was killed. That is the story but most is jettisoned for a fictional account of events in the Ohio Valley. The villain is Howard De Silva intent on keeping out the colonists by arming the Indians so that he could have a monopoly of the fur trade. He is also responsible for illegally bringing Paulette Goddard into the colony of Virginia as an indentured servant. Gary Cooper is the man opposing De Silva in his plans regarding the Indians and his plans regarding Goddard. The film is not DeMille's best but it's Technicolor De Silva's performance the appearance of Boris Karloff as a villainous Indian he would play an Indian again a few years later in TAP ROOTS and the two leads make it entertaining enough. But my interest in it deals with two supporting roles. Porter Hall is Mr. Leech who is bribed although he is aware it is a hanging offense to send the pardoned Goddard to the colonies as an indentured servant. He's not in much of the film but it is a nice performance. But better is Mike Mazurki. The exwrestler was not an actor but occasionally turned in first rate performances such as his lovestruck thug in MURDER MY SWEET and Joan Blondell's boyfriend and moral superior to Tyrone Power in NIGHTMARE ALLEY. Here he is a minor villain  a thug for De Silva. For most of the film he is doing De Silva's dirty work without a thought. But at the film's conclusion he is faced with a moment of truth. De Silva Cooper Goddard and Mazurki are trapped in a cabin but have weapons to protect themselves. Cooper knows that troops will be arriving soon to rescue them. But De Silva is deluded into thinking he and Mazurki are safe because they have been arming the Indians  he's ignoring that as a white Englishmancolonial he's as hated as the others. He tells Mazurki to open the door and signal the Indians to let them go. Mazurki showing a commendable intelligence refuses. De Silva orders him again and then he decides to do it himself. He opens the door and an arrow hits him in the center of the chest. Mazurki gets up and closes the door from the back. He then tells Cooper they'll all wait until the troops arrive. The film soon ends but to me that moment was one to treasure. Rarely has a subordinate have such a satisfactory way of being proved correct over his boss.";

Set in the American colonies of the 1760's the film brings into conflict a love triangle Indian uprisings dastardly dealings by greedy whites in selling arms to tribes for furs and the rights of indentured servants in the colonies. Featuring Gary Cooper and Paulette Goddard in the lead male and female roles plus Howard Da Silva in the role of the sneeringly evil fur trader this film moves at a decent clip even if some history is ignored for the sake of the story in the film.Ah the story. Paulette Goddard has run afoul of the British judicial system and is given the choice of execution in England or slavery in the colonies for a period of 14 years. She chooses the route of an indentured servant and is placed aboard a British frigate heading for the colonies. While on board ship she catches the eye of both Cooper and Da Silva and in a shipboard auction is purchased by Cooper much to the chagrin of Da Silva. Cooper intends to free her when the ship arrived in the colonies but Da Silva forces the auctioneer to resell Goddard unbeknownst to Cooper.In later scenes the three engage in one conflict after another which brings in to the arena the Indian tribes led by Boris Karloff playing a Seneca chief named Guyasuta. Da Silva's role Martin Garth had earlier married the chief's daughter and that gives him an inroad with the Indian tribes. Cooper as Captain Chris Holden is able to rescue Abby Hale Goddard's role from the Indians and they make their escape down river which leads to a trip through the rapids and over a waterfall. Finally comes the showdown in which the Indians attack the nearby Fort Pitt garrisoned by British regulars and frontiersmen and their families.

Cecil Kellaway Ward Bond and a very youthful Lloyd Bridges add to the protagonists in the film and Mike Mazurski gives a great performance as Garth's henchman in the attempt to control the Indian fur trading practice.Unconquered gives Cecil B. DeMille a chance to embellish another period of history and while the production is worth watching a viewer needs to take the overall work as entertainment and not completely true to the times of 1763 Colonial America. 8 out of 10.".

DeMille and his last featured role during his stay with the Paramount studio. I'd have to say that Coop went out with an expensive bang. The film illustrates both the strengths and weaknesses of a DeMille project. The color photography by Ray Rennahan is first rate the eye for historical detail about the colonial period in terms of costumes and sets superb. The spectacle is only as DeMille could create it. Yet he could make such an elementary mistake by having the Seneca Indians pursue Gary Cooper on horseback. It was only the plains Indian tribes west of the Mississippi that used horses. But the public wanted to see Indians on horses they were used to seeing Indians on horses. So DeMille gave them what they wanted. DeMille himself in his autobiography confessed that he was not satisfied with the showdown of hero Gary Cooper and chief villain Howard DaSilva. He felt it was anticlimatic. I wish he had done it a bit better myself.The film is based on a historical novel The Judas Tree by Neil Swanson who also wrote Allegany Uprising about the same colonial period. The story takes place with the background of the uprising by Pontiac who was trying to unite all the Indian tribes and keep the whites on the east side of the Appalachian mountains. Paulette Goddard is a woman condemned to the gallows in London and is given a choice to go to the colonies as a bond servant. Of course she takes it and catches the eye of both Cooper and DaSilva. That's a common DeMille characteristic in his films two men in heat over the leading lady. DaSilva is a trader with the Indians and his reasons for wanting to keep whites out of the western territories is so he can keep a monopoly of the fur trade. He's quite ruthless in his methods even marrying the daughter of Chief Boris Karloff of the Senecas played by Katherine DeMille. Karloff's Senecas are allied with the Pontiac Confederation and their job is to attack Fort Pitt and the town it shields the little village of Pittsburgh.Such events as the siege of Fort Pitt and the massacre at Venango are interwoven in the lives of Cooper and Goddard. He leaves Fort Pitt to rescue her and they both have quite a time escaping from the Senecas. The scene that is most talked about here is our hero and heroine going over Niagara Falls in a canoe chased in canoes by pursuing Senecas. What's most interesting about it is that it isn't done on location. Living up here for the past 10 years and seeing it as a kid I can tell you the Falls doesn't look as primeval in real life as DeMille shows you how it looked in 1763. Yet even today it's quite a breathtaking site to see our intrepid two take the plunge.Back in 1947 we certainly weren't terribly concerned about presenting the Indian point of view on screen and DeMille is a man of his times. There was a good film done about a decade ago about Chief Tecumseh and his attempt at an Indian confederation. Maybe we will get one about Pontiac and his movement.Until then we have to watch items like Unconquered enjoy the spectacle and fill in the blanks.".

He also believed in a modern equivalent of his own whereby he took his share made his mark and crowned himself a king of the movie industry he had helped to create. This legendary arrogance carried itself over into every aspect of the pictures he produced and directed. belief Part of this arrogance involved an conviction in his own abilities to carry a movie. He would hire writers who were able to assemble a story with a decent balance of action and romance rather than those capable of depth or elegance. Likewise he tended to cast people according to their physicality rather than their talent. Not that he always took on bad actors but he gave them little coaching or try to fit person to persona. Paulette Godard for example falls well below her usual standard here. She looks right because she is both attractive and upstanding but the character is far too bland for her usual feistiness. It didn't always work out badly though. DeMille's male leads could often be dull lumps grunting their way through the adventure but Gary Cooper was really made for these more modest roles. He underplays it beautifully and puts plenty of character into the tiniest of gestures. Then there were professional naturalist types like Victor Varconi who was always able to portray a credible human being no matter how leaden the script.And if DeMille's flair couldn't quite carry a movie it could at least prod it along a little. Remembered largely as a showman he was more than that a wonderful visual director with an excellent command of crowd scenes. Take the second scene on board the ship. We dolly in through the bustle of sailors going about their business but in the middle of the frame mostly obscured at first Porter Hall sits tapping his cane on a case. This draws our attention to him as a character rather than an extra even though he begins the shot as no more than a face in the crowd. This is typical DeMille  the creation of a realistic looking environment but with the ability to bend it towards the needs of story and scene. Later in the same scene we get some great examples of extras cutting through the line of action as Godard and Cooper talk punctuating the scene and giving it a kind of awkward feel. Again this is both realistic and effective.Contemporary reviewer Bosley Crowther described Unconquered as being as viciously antiredskin as The Birth of a Nation was antiNegro long years back. He's not far wrong although Unconquered is more tacitly patronising than Birth's explicit hostility. Still you can get an impression of the tone from the fact that British horror legend Boris Karloff was cast as the Indian chief. It's not just that Karloff looks vaguely Amerindian if you squint and add a large dollop of imagination it's the fact that in DeMille's eyes the natives are creepy boogiemen and he casts Karloff as their leader for the same reason as someone might cast him to play a monster or a mad doctor. The fact that even critics of the day could castigate DeMille for his racism shows just how out of touch he was becoming.Then again there is another strand to Unconquered that we cannot see in previous DeMille efforts  one that is almost certainly due to the impact of the recent war. The picture is incredibly frank and merciless about death and bloodshed. Cooper's buddies are picked off instantly without even a say goodbye to my wife. One of DeMille's most elaborate and evocative shot compositions is of a mass of brutally slain soldiers. And when Cooper discovers the Salters it is surely the most poignant moment in any DeMille picture. Perhaps the pompous old conqueror had a heart after all.".

	schema:reviewBody "NOTES Nominated for an Academy Award for Special Effects but lost to the only other nominee Green Dolphin Street. Negative cost around 5 million.Location exteriors filmed near Pittsburgh the forest scenes and by Arthur Rosson's unit on the Snake River Idaho the canoe sequence.COMMENT No survey of Hollywood's treatment of bigbudget westerns would be complete without a Cecil B. De Mille epic. What is curious about this one though is that it wasn't particularly popular at the boxoffice and actually lost money. This seems strange as most of the ingredients for popular success are here. True the movie is overlong but most cashpaying patrons will hardly object to this extra value for their money. I thought the film would be improved if three or four of the long and rather pointless dialogue scenes between Cooper and Goddard were cut. My impression is that these scenes merely pad out the film as a sop to the two principals. True the script is somewhat naive and juvenile. It reduces historical figures to pasteboard cutouts and then hands them verbose dialogue of appropriate banality. It says much for the players that most are able to rise above their material. But the plot does allow for plenty of incident and spectacle including shooting the rapids on the Snake which anticipates The River Wild. It's a pity that the peg on which all this drama is hung namely the conflict between hero Cooper and heavy Da Silva is so disappointingly resolved with the villain receiving very cursory if just desserts from Cooper's faster pistol. It's true too that neither Cooper nor Miss Goddard seem entirely comfortable in their roles. The script forces Coop to do some remarkably stupid things so it's probably no cause for wonder that he often appears to be acting halfheartedly at halfsteam. Miss Goddard seems far too elegant for a maidofallwork. Her makeup is too heavy. Her performance on the other hand seems too lightweight. Many of the support players also seem somewhat illatease. Fortunately Da Silva makes his villain really mean and nasty.Technically the film's tension is a bit undermined by some obvious process screen effects. Director De Mille's hand is most in evidence in the crowd and action scenes. Rennahan's fine Technicolor photography is also a major asset.P.S. When asked about Fredric or is it Frederic? M. Frank his coscreenwriter Charles Bennett said in an interview with Pat McGilligan A lovely guy but he couldn't write his own name. Well that last comment was literally true anyway.".

	onyx:emotionText "NOTES Nominated for an Academy Award for Special Effects but lost to the only other nominee Green Dolphin Street. Negative cost around 5 million.Location exteriors filmed near Pittsburgh the forest scenes and by Arthur Rosson's unit on the Snake River Idaho the canoe sequence.COMMENT No survey of Hollywood's treatment of bigbudget westerns would be complete without a Cecil B. De Mille epic. What is curious about this one though is that it wasn't particularly popular at the boxoffice and actually lost money. This seems strange as most of the ingredients for popular success are here. True the movie is overlong but most cashpaying patrons will hardly object to this extra value for their money. I thought the film would be improved if three or four of the long and rather pointless dialogue scenes between Cooper and Goddard were cut. My impression is that these scenes merely pad out the film as a sop to the two principals. True the script is somewhat naive and juvenile. It reduces historical figures to pasteboard cutouts and then hands them verbose dialogue of appropriate banality. It says much for the players that most are able to rise above their material.

	schema:reviewBody "This is my favourite Cecil B DeMille picture. I'm not really a huge fan of his films however this one dealt with a slice of history I find fascinating.The story is set in Britain's American colonies during the Pontiac Rebellion of 1763. Just before the conflict commences Captain Chris Holden Gary Cooper buys indentured convict Abby Hale Paulette Goddard. At first it is to thwart adversary Martin Garth Howard Da Silva but later they fall in love. Da Silva has the showiest role as the frontier equivalent of the head of organised crime  he supplies the Indians with weapons and ignites the war.Some old movies gained a touch of movie magic because of the slightly unreal look of the sets especially when shot in moody BW but not Cecil's movies they just looked fake. Lighting outdoors for the technicolour cameras was a problem for sure but one movie Northwest Passage made a few years earlier and set around the same period managed to do it brilliantly. The problem with locking the film away on the sound stage is that this was a time in American history that is all about the outdoors the unexplored wilderness with the small population of colonists set against the vastness of the mountains and forests. Michael Mann caught it in The Last of the Mohicans but DeMille's movie is very stagebound.However Cooper and Goddard hold the thing together. Paulette Goddard could wear period costumes beautifully and she played feisty well. Cooper was the epitome of the confident quietly spoken man of action although he didn't change gears much from film to film.Real life characters are threaded throughout the story George Washington and even Guyasuta the Indian Chief played by Boris Karloff. However Cecil didn't avoid too many stereotypes in his depiction of the Indians in fact he probably invented some of them.Paulette Goddard plays an Englishwoman sentenced to transportation to the American colonies and virtual slavery. Before the War of Independence 40000 convicts were sent. After losing America Britain transported its convicts to create colonies in Australia eventually 150000 were sent over about 60 years. Possibly not many Americans or Australians are aware of that connection.There haven't been many films about this era other than various versions of The Last of the Mohicans. Unconquered works despite its cheesiness mainly because of the actors and the colourful period in which it is set.".

Trouble is brewing with the Indians called savages. The savages speak a madeup language unless iksa is a prominent part of their Algonquian dialect. When they speak English they say You burn white woman at stake. Paulette Goddard is a slave whose ownership is in question  a tug of war between the honorable Cooper and the villainous Henry da Silva. The legitimate owner of course is Cooper who soon takes to romancing his slave. The moonlight has turned your dress into emeralds. And The starlight is dancing in your eyes. Now lines like this don't come easily to Gary Cooper nor does his dress uniform. Comfortable in fringed leather he has to wear this garish outfit to the governor's ball. An absurd threecornered hat. A bright blue jacket with scarlet facings and bright brass buttons. But BOOTS  no white stockings for Gary Cooper. Real men don't wear white stockings. It's just one step away from fishnet and garter belts. All together he carries on like a man with long jointed sticks instead of limbs but always honorable. Cooper bamboozles a tribe of savages about to burn Goddard alive by playing tricks with a compass. The Indian chief Boris Karloff is stupefied by the unerring arrow of the compass. It's a scene out of Mark Twain's A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court. Karloff's character  Guyasuta  Chief of the Senecas  was a real historical figure an early pal of and guide for George Washington. Paulette Goddard is an attractive women even though she is no longer the sprightly nymph with the pretty legs from Charlie Chaplin's Modern Times. And she's superb as a slave whose dress may be torn to shreds who may be roughhoused by the villainous cheating thieving lying murdering rapist Howard da Silva dunked in a rapidly flowing river and tortured by Indians and who must scrub floors in a filthy tavern but who never loses a false eyelash or is without lipstick and rouge. She was never a bravura actress but evidently a nice woman. When she died she left most of her estate to New York University.Those taverns by the way look convincing as all get out like the other interiors. Production design and set dressing don't usually get their due but they should because they add so much texture to the images. That tavern is stuffed full of sacks of grain hewn tables simple rickety chairs piles of corn long rifles hung on racks trenchers pewter tankards and unidentifiable bits of feathered artifacts. The direction is by Cecil B. De Mille so don't expect nuance in the acting. When a woman is frightened she doesn't just scream. She puts her clenched fists against her cheeks pops her eyeballs and shrieks in horror  if she doesn't faint outright.The movie has its merits. It's as colorful as a peacock's tail. The interplay between the characters is old fashioned but classic. We get to see George Washington when he was a mere colonel. And there is a genuinely exciting scene in which Cooper and Goddard escape from the pursuing Indians in a canoe. Their canoe plunges over a waterfall the size of Niagara and their escape is a miracle. At the end Fort Pitt is besieged by whooping savages scaling the palisades using canoes as ladders. The white defenders shoot them down by the hundreds but savages are as many as needle on pine tree mosquito in swamp fish in Lake Erie flea on hound dog snake on head of Medusa pigeon on statue dollar in Trump wallet fly on picnic table illegal at border gun in NRA closet.The climax involves a shoot out between two enemies. I know you can draw faster than me says one of them drawing a line quickly from a thousand and one scenes in cheap Westerns. Well Fort Pitt is under siege and hopelessly outnumbered. And the outcome? The cavalry arrives and saves the day. Salutem ex mortuis.".

	schema:headline " A Fun Movie!";
	schema:reviewBody "Unconquered is one of those old swashbuckling epics that came out during the era of epics during the 1940's and 1950's. Is it the greatest epic ever? Of course not but all that matters to me was the entertainment factor of the movie. In that part the movie succeeded. I had a fun time watching our main character Chris Holden pick fights with the Natives his fellow countrymen and even the women. I'm not sure if this film is entirely historically accurate and some whitewashing may be prevalent but does it really matter much? Especially in an older movie like this film? This film was filmed in technicolor which of course added to the expensive budget but it really gave definition to the epic as lighting and color techniques helped this film out.I find it rather fascinating what the film was based on. In 1862 the descendants of the Holdens of Virginia wrote a letter about similar events to the one Anny Hale gone through in the film. The basic plot outline of Abby's and this woman is very similar. Both were English women sentenced to the American colonies accused of murder. But had lustful men come after her. There is a real historical document pertaining to the events of this movie but the movie decides to expand upon the story making it somewhat a fictional story.Cecil B. DeMille known for his great 1956 epic The Ten Commandments directs a film that takes place in preRevolution colonial America. London gal Abby Hale is sentenced to slavery in the colonies but she is bought and freed by colonist Chris Holden. But her freedom is taken away by a rival of Holden Garth. This rivalry helps culminate a disastrous relationship between the colonists of Fort Pitt and the Indians who want their land free of the white men.We get some good acting here. No one is particularly great but it seems like everyone is having a fun time. The biggest star Gary Cooper is no stranger to Westerns and this film uses his talents very effectively. He definitely delivers the charm of a leading man. Paulette Goddard was pretty good as Abby but I feel like her character is annoying at times. I liked Boris Karloff as the chief of the Indians despite the fact this is clearly an example of Hollywood ancient bias. I also liked Howard Da Silva does a solid job as the villainous Garth who takes advantage of the Natives for his own self. Finally Cecil Kellaway turns in a solid performance as Chris's friend Jeremy Love.Overall Unconquered is a solid oldfashioned historical epic. There is nothing remotely special about the film and it doesn't try to be. It just wants to entertain moviewatchers of all ages and it succeeds in that category. As a history student I can easily point out many of the historical differences. But this is a movie review not a history lesson. I will save that lecture for another day. The tone may be historically inaccurate but one should overlook the details. On its merit as a fun adventure movie Unconquered succeeds very much so.My Grade A".

DeMille known for his great 1956 epic The Ten Commandments directs a film that takes place in preRevolution colonial America. London gal Abby Hale is sentenced to slavery in the colonies but she is bought and freed by colonist Chris Holden. But her freedom is taken away by a rival of Holden Garth. This rivalry helps culminate a disastrous relationship between the colonists of Fort Pitt and the Indians who want their land free of the white men.We get some good acting here. No one is particularly great but it seems like everyone is having a fun time. The biggest star Gary Cooper is no stranger to Westerns and this film uses his talents very effectively. He definitely delivers the charm of a leading man. Paulette Goddard was pretty good as Abby but I feel like her character is annoying at times. I liked Boris Karloff as the chief of the Indians despite the fact this is clearly an example of Hollywood ancient bias. I also liked Howard Da Silva does a solid job as the villainous Garth who takes advantage of the Natives for his own self. Finally Cecil Kellaway turns in a solid performance as Chris's friend Jeremy Love.Overall Unconquered is a solid oldfashioned historical epic. There is nothing remotely special about the film and it doesn't try to be. It just wants to entertain moviewatchers of all ages and it succeeds in that category. As a history student I can easily point out many of the historical differences. But this is a movie review not a history lesson. I will save that lecture for another day. The tone may be historically inaccurate but one should overlook the details. On its merit as a fun adventure movie Unconquered succeeds very much so.My Grade A";

He was also one of the first to pack his films with gratuitous sex and violence and you have to give him credit for that. He got away with it by inserting preachy moral messages that proved the evil of everything he had just shoved in your face and you have to give him credit for that. His films were enjoyable in a goofy sort of way but that doesn't apply to this one.There's one thing that DeMille could never be accused of and that's cutting corners. His movies were expensive and they looked it. They were usually also packed with wellknown stars such as Gary Cooper and Charlton Heston. The one thing that few of his movies had though was a coherent script and this movie is a prime example. Stars production values spectacle...whatever advantages this film has are sunk by the absolutely idiotic dialogue the actors are forced to spew out. You have to wonder what the actors were thinking as they were reciting this drivel. You also have to wonder what the writers were thinking as they were whipping this junk up didn't they realize that people don't even remotely talk or act like they do in this movie? Everything in this film is overblown overheated and overdone. The only other one of DeMille's films I can think of offhand that goes even further over the edge is Northwest Mounted Police which is so jawdroppingly awful it should be classified as a comedy.As long as you realize what you're getting into the movie is fun in a goofball campy sort of way. If you're looking for anything else forget it.".

	schema:headline " One of DeMille's better films of the era.";
	schema:reviewBody "While Cecil B. DeMille is known for his sweeping and often rather dull religious epics he actually made quite a few historical films about the history of North America such as Reap the Wild Wind The Story of Dr. Wassell and Unconquered. While I wouldn't say any of these historical pieces are great I do find them much more entertaining and less overthetop than his 'religious' films. But like his religious epics these films too usually feature large casts big budgets and long running times.The movie begins with Paulette Goddard being sentenced to death or indentured servitude in America. While choosing between the two fates is easy it's not easy to understand why Goddard was cast as an English womanespecially since she never sounded the least bit English nor tried to.On board the ship taking her to the Colonies circa 1763give or take a few years she runs afoul of a scoundrel Howard De Silvaa man who almost always played jerks and heavies until being cast as Ben Franklin in 1776. De Silva insists on buying her and is enraged when niceguy Gary Cooper purchases her instead. But Cooper doesn't want a slave and soon sets her freehe bought her mostly to tick off De Silva who he really really hates. As De Silva is a cheat liar and rogue he pays for Goddard anyway and convinces the auctioneer to take payment from BOTH Cooper and himand giving him Goddard!! Goddard is told that Cooper really didn't buy herand meant her purchase as a joke and she believes this.In the midst of all this there is discontent among the Indian tribes of the West at this point the West is the Allegheny Mountainsnear Pittsburgh. According to this film and I am sure today the tribes involved would STRONGLY disagree De Silva stirred up the natives and got them to stop their infighting and band together for war against the White settlers. And for some reason it's up to Cooper to put a stop to it.Now at this point the casting is very interesting. In the politically incorrect manner of the day the leading Indian is played by a Westernerin this case Boris Karloff. Now the weirdest thing about this is that Karloff actually passed for an amazingly authenticlooking guy in the filmjust like he did in an earlier version of Last of the Mohicans.The bottom line is can Cooper avert an allout war? Can be kill the evil De Silva? And will he get the girl in the end? Considering it's a Hollywood film you kind of suspect the answer to these questions!!! But in spite of this predictability the film is quite entertaining. I also liked SOME of the outdoor scenessome were quite spectacular. However and this is my biggest gripe is that all too often instead of relying on location shooting it was all too often clearly shot in a sound stage...too often! So despite the nice color film and acting the whole thing looked a bit too stagy for my tastes...and sometimes the painted backgrounds are ridiculously bad. But if that's the worst of it I can live with this.".

That and the knowledge that Wayne was all for reality as much as possible really made me a watch it anytime fan of this picture.If one takes into account the decade in which the picture was made it can be and is for me at least a very enjoyable film.

It also explained that Red Adair really did use explosives to put out oil well fires which many people found hard to believe.This was a highly believable present day performance by John Wayne which is somewhat special in and of itself. There was only one brawl which was all good fun and we even get to see Mr. Wayne get a face full of what looks kind of like oil. It was dyed water. There is no heavy moralistic message to this film a minimum of flag waving and watching it is just plain fun.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sandwiched in between the critical beating John Wayne took for The Green Berets and a bunch of westerns culminating in his Oscar performance for True Grit is this little known film he did about a group of men fighting oil fires a truly dangerous profession. The Hellfighters has the look and feel of a Wayne family effort with it being produced by Batjac and having in its cast Wayne regulars like Edward Faulkner and Bruce Cabot. I wonder where son Patrick was.A little over 20 years after Hellfighters came out the person that Wayne's character was based on Red Adair came into prominence when he took on the Herculean task of putting out all those oil fires that Saddam Hussein started in Kuwait when he fled that country. Turns out the biggest assignment Adair had was way in his future in 1968.I'm sure Red Adair must have been flattered all to heck when the biggest box office draw in cinema history was portraying a facsimile of him on the screen. Who knows though maybe Red Adair's real story and real name on the screen might be good entertainment. Might be a great subject for a film now what with all the new computer generated special effects that could be used.Though the film is based on Adair's exploits it is first and foremost a John Wayne film. He's not Red Adair on the screen it's the Duke that all of us have come to know. Wayne and his cast put together a nice action filled film with a minor subplot about his family life. Vera Miles plays his estranged wife Katharine Ross his daughter and Jim Hutton a protg Wayne is grooming to take over his company.This was Wayne's third film with Vera Miles and twice before he didn't wind up with her either in The Searchers or The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. Third time the charm.Hellfighters also is an example of Wayne's well known generosity to his fellow players. When he liked you he was the best friend you could have. Jay C. Flippen who plays an oil executive lost a leg to diabetes a year or two before. Wayne gave him that extra pay day by casting him in Hellfighters in a wheelchair. I could cite a lot of other examples of him helping people by doing that in other films.Hellfighters is an enjoyable two hours of Wayne in modern dress battling the elements like he did in The High and the Mighty and Island in the Sky instead of bad guys. There is one sequence where he and his crew were battling an oil fire in Venezuela with some rebels shooting at them. Since it's the Duke you kind of expect him to pick up a rifle and blow them all away. Though Hellfighters is a good not a great film I'd still like to see the real Red Adair story on screen.".

	schema:headline " Thrilling and dangerous experiences of Texas oil fire fighters who undertake their feats all over the world";
	schema:reviewBody "It deals with red suited firefighters who attempt to quell large scale oil and gas blazes around the world. Enterprise Buckman and Co. whose owner results to be John Wayne  takes up with his younger colleague Jim Hutton and subsequently takes place a romantic subplot in Armageddon film style being entirely suspicious  as young guy falls for the chief's daughter .It is based on the real career of Red Adair. Acceptable and passable film though the moving screenplay turns out to be uneven sexist windy and dull remarking a strong machism. BuckmanAdair and his group of brave hell fighters are the authentic protagonists . In fact real life of oil well fire fighter Adair was used as main axis in script and he served as technical advisor to this. And Wayne role is clearly based on him. What passes for a script involves Wayne's stranged daughter Katharine Ross coming down off The Graduate  and who falls for the second in command Jim Hutton. As they extinguish massive fires in oil fields all around the world. As they go aboard their airplane to Canada Malaysiaand South America  Venezuela where the valiant bunch is attacked by a violent guerrilla. This exciting film packs emotion ordinary fights thrills and spectacular scenes . Apart from the main subject this is a typical Wayne vehicle screenwritten by Western expert Clair Huffaker and being accompanied by a peculiar team  as well as developing troubles between themselves and their wives . Fragmentary but enjoyable the movie is full of saloon brawls  action  battles blunt staccato dialog and silly love stories . But is a shame Adair or other writers didn't fire up the screenplay . The picture benefits itself immensely from the breathtaking conflagrations and impressive production design by Alexander Golitzen. Here Wayne was generally deemed to be too old for this role. Wayne gives his habitual acting thanks to McLagen in fact he directed him in several Westerns as Cahill United States Marshal The undefeated Chisum McLintock  Big Jake . Along with a fine cast as his redundant love interest Vera Miles and their daughter Katharina Ross  though Vera was only 10 years older than Ross. Support cast is pretty good  such as  J C Flippen Bruce Cabot Laraine Stephens Edward Faulkner Valentin Vargas  among others. It contains a rousing and attractive musical score by Leonard Rosenman. Colorful and evocative cinematography in Technicolor and color de Luxe by William H Clothier John Ford's regular . This stirring tale of macho oil well firefighters and their wives was professionally directed by Andrew McLagen. He was the son of Ford's stock company stalwart Victor McLagen. He was a prolific craftsman who made all kinds of genres  such as  Wartime  Dirty dozen next mission Sea wolves Breakthrough Wild geese The Devil's brigade . Action adventure genre  Sahara  Ffolkes  Mitchell On wings of eagles . And Western  Shenandoah The way west  The rare breed Bandolero The last hard men  The Blue and the Gray and The shadow riders again with JKatharine Ross. The flick will appeal to John Wayne fans. Well worth watching.".

Now understand that I really like John Wayne films but I must admit that aside from THE SHOOTIST all his films after THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE were mediocre and formulaicso much so that they offer nothing particularly new even TRUE GRIT which garnered Wayne an Oscar even though he'd made many better films. Even one of his films I really liked from this era ROOSTER COGBURN is essentially THE African QUEEN set in the old West. And what formulaic elements do these films have in common? Well how about a way too old Duke Wayne getting in a fist fight in all these films and he was into his 60s macho arguments among the manly actors about who is going to do the selfless act whatever that might be an occasional overreliance on comedy and John walking through the film as if he's in slowmotion which at his age he was.

It is my honor to now speak around the country about the history of the firefighting profession and have helped make several television documentaries about the subject. I have many firsthand stories of the making of Hellfighters told to me by Coots Matthews who was very much involved in the staging of several of the fires used in the movie during filming around Baytown and Conroe Texas. Red himself told me on more than one occasion that making this film and his relationship with John Wayne was one the highlights of his career.The movie is not particularly memorable from an acting or story standpoint nor technically accurate but is nevertheless a testament to a great American hero Red Adair and to a unique profession known for it's colorful characters and for its incredibly tenuous dangerous work. Hellfighters is as close to the real deal as there is in the film world. It depicts real men doing real work of an era that is now gone forever.A remake of this movie is very plausible from a technical standpoint making fires and blowoutsand with improvements in sound and cinematography the past 40 years the imagery could be vastly improved the story line greatly enhanced to include an emotional component to the business of fighting oil fires not seen in Hellfighters. The possibilities are limitless. In the mean time lets enjoy Hellfighters exactly for what it is a damn good John Wayne movie. One of my favorites in fact.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ia small mountain town Isild Le Besco's character Fred Frdrique is an angry young woman working on the night shift at a hospital. As a nurse she's efficient but remote. She's fed up with her life. Says she can't take it any more. When she talks to her cop ex boyfriend Andr Christophe Sermet about leaving town he makes her even madder when he admits he's already got a new girl living with him. In reaction she picks up two men in a bar and has quick sex with one after the other. Couldn't you be more tender? the first asks her.Have you heard? I'm not tender she tells the second T'as entendu? J'suis pas douce. That's the film's original French title 'Pas Douce'. Not Tender.Fred is a crack shot a champion marksman when she was younger. She's also mad at her dad Philippe Villeumier a commanding presence and a supervisor at the firing range where she practices. As striking an actress as she is striking looking when she's properly used Le Besco is as obsessively angry here as she was obsessively adoring of the famous singer in her role as a nave fan in Emmanuelle Bercot's 2005 Backstage but here though still just in her midtwenties she has more authority.Just when Fred seems to be getting ready to leave town as she's told Andr she's about to do throwing away her junior marksman silver cups she suddenly takes up her rifle and goes out. She's on a hill in the woods when a bunch of school kids walk by below her. Two aggressive boys are yelling at each other. One has a slingshot. He shoots a bird then when the other boy protests shoots him and hits him in the eye. Impulsively Fred swings her rifle toward them and fires hitting the boy with the slingshot in the knee after grazing the boy holding his eye. An ambulance comes. She rushes after it in her car.The boy with the damaged knee Marco Steven De Almeida is put in the ward where Fred works. After some rough moments on both sides Fred commits herself to Marco's care. This development is justified in the plot by the fact that he's so hostile and difficult no other nurse wants to deal with him. A relationship develops that tempers the rebellion of both individuals. Fred's plan to leave town goes on hold she still has to decide what to do about her legal culpability. As Marco's care proceeds both he and Fred soften. Fred opens up to Marco's divorced parents including a mother Eugenia Lio returned from Portugal and his dad with whom he lives Yves Verhoeven. The history of family problems Marco comes from is deftly sketched in as are several other occupants of the hospital room always with an alteration in Marco. Marco and Fred relate in part through PlayStation. She's good at that so she's cooler than he thought.If you asked what makes 'A Parting Shot' different from something on an American TV series the quick answer would be Le Besco's breasts. As in Jacquot's recent Untouchable they're seen and they are beautiful. But there's more to it than that. The initial rebellion is outlined rather quickly for both characters but the short 83minute film still manages to be subtle at showing the emotional changes in both these wild children after the shooting. Perhaps the best thing about the film is it doesn't tie up all its threads neatly as a TV drama might.Le Besco's pouty manner can be irritating sometimes but this is a role made to order for her. De Almeida is also excellent. His Marco is a handful but also behind the anger winningly vulnerable. Ultimately A Parting Shot far from not tender leaves one with an impression of surprising tenderness.''A Parting Shot''Pas douce' was awarded the Fipresci international federation of film critics Prize at the San Francisco International Film Festival 2007. This is the Swissborn Waltz's first featurelength film and it promises good things to come.".

	schema:reviewBody "Frederique is a sexy bolshy and slightly dangerous young woman. I am annoyed with myself that I find her slightly attractive. There is a simmering sexuality. As if her hormones are on adrenalin. As if her desire whatever it is will brook no obstacle. As if it rules her life. Not the sort of woman to get involved with if you can help it I think. It's like she has a permanently bad case of PMT.She's a nurse. Planning to pack it all in a week from now. A patient has just died. Bldy nuisance. But I start to suspect that Frederique's aggressive exterior conceals a lot of emotional turbulence. Maybe pain. But not that she's likely to let anyone know. She believes in the tough exterior she's created for herself.Frederique tries to relax after work. She's an expert shot with a rifle. Nice hobby. Carelessly leaves her gun on the back seat of a car sometimes though. She has an emotionally unsatisfying confrontation with her ex. Goes to a bar and gets pssed. Gets off with two men. Yes both of them.Now comes the bad bit. No nothing to do with those two dckheads she's just bedded. They haven't even begun to slake the anger that's boiling over inside her for no particular reason. Out in the woods a couple of schoolchildren early teens are taunting each other. Why is Frederique there? We don't know yet but she can't take her eyes off these boys. One of them has a catapult. He shoots a bird. Then he shoots his friend. Then Frederique shoots him.Parting Shot is about dealing with anger about finding epiphany about forgiving others  and oneself. Frederique lies to the police and isn't discovered. But possibly worse the boy his knee badly injured from the rifle shot is in her ward. Her attempts to get him transferred fail. Slowly the two of them form a strange bond. In helping him to deal with his preteen angst she is able to face her own anger as well as the shock and selfreproach she suffers the results of her unpremiditated action are sinking in.Hospitalised and eventually opening up when our catapultwielding lad says he only wanted to hurt his pal at the time something clicks inside Frederique. But then he begins to suspect her.The main problem with Parting Shot is believing in the character of Frederique. She hides many complex contradictions. Passionate but emotionally detached. Surface normal but deeply troubled. Is her isolation the result of modern day pressures we all feel to a degree? Once we can accept her Parting Shot becomes a fascinating meditative study for anyone that has ever felt themselves in the grip of uncontrollable passion rage frustration. Or simply wanting to vent one's anger against the universe for no particular reason.Note to IMDb  it would be helpful to know what words you consider 'prohibited'  otherwise one has to make random guesses and just splatter a review like this with asterisks".

Out in the woods a couple of schoolchildren early teens are taunting each other. Why is Frederique there? We don't know yet but she can't take her eyes off these boys. One of them has a catapult. He shoots a bird. Then he shoots his friend. Then Frederique shoots him.Parting Shot is about dealing with anger about finding epiphany about forgiving others  and oneself. Frederique lies to the police and isn't discovered. But possibly worse the boy his knee badly injured from the rifle shot is in her ward. Her attempts to get him transferred fail. Slowly the two of them form a strange bond. In helping him to deal with his preteen angst she is able to face her own anger as well as the shock and selfreproach she suffers the results of her unpremiditated action are sinking in.Hospitalised and eventually opening up when our catapultwielding lad says he only wanted to hurt his pal at the time something clicks inside Frederique. But then he begins to suspect her.The main problem with Parting Shot is believing in the character of Frederique. She hides many complex contradictions. Passionate but emotionally detached. Surface normal but deeply troubled. Is her isolation the result of modern day pressures we all feel to a degree? Once we can accept her Parting Shot becomes a fascinating meditative study for anyone that has ever felt themselves in the grip of uncontrollable passion rage frustration. Or simply wanting to vent one's anger against the universe for no particular reason.Note to IMDb  it would be helpful to know what words you consider 'prohibited'  otherwise one has to make random guesses and just splatter a review like this with asterisks";

Constantly juggling profound psychological analysis and contrived simplicity it ultimately leaves the viewer with nothing new its short running time steady pace and gritty performances ensuring however that it flows quickly without exasperating.The original title refers to the female lead Frdrique Isild Le Besco a lonely mentally unstable nurse who lives in a small Swiss town. To be more specific not tender is how some bloke describes her when she engages in casual sex with him and another guy. Why she does that is never explained. The same goes for the following scene where she hides in a wood and decides to kill herself with a shotgun. Weirdly enough the bullet winds up injuring a young boy named Marco Steven de Almeida and just to make things more ironic she is among the nurses who are asked to take care of him.The premise is admittedly fresh and intriguing offering plenty of ideas for a solid drama.

What for example is the point of introducing Marco's parents and their supposedly troubled marriage and then ignore the whole situation for the rest of the movie? Similarly some room is offered to Frdrique's boyfriend but with no explanation of her unhappiness and his possible role in it those scenes come off as hollow and pointless.Another flaw is the shooting scene that triggers the entire movie pun intended reading the plot synopsis I expected a certain sequence what I saw was so different and ridiculous I will not reveal any details see for yourself it almost ruined the mood of the feature. Fortunately the few bits where perpetrator and victim interact are enough to keep the film on track Le Besco's ambiguous stare and de Almeida's contained rage completing each other in a bond that effectively saves A Parting Shot from being the usual simpleminded arty piece of work that tries to reach the heart without even knowing where it is.6510".

She's cold and abrasive to her patients and coworkers bitterly estranged from her father a burden on her protective sister and very sexually aggressive but not tender as the French title of this translates. After breaking up with a boyfriend she goes in the woods with her rifle to commit suicide but instead ends up impulsively shooting a troubled young boy who is as hostile and disagreeable as she is. When he winds up under her care at the hospital they end up bonding and both become a little bit more tender.Isild Lebesco is one of the most interesting young French actresses. She is not a classical beautyshe's rather ordinary looking in the face and even unattractive from some angles. Her body though is positively stunning which is perhaps why she's had nude scenes in about every movie she's been in since appearing in Gilrls Can't Swim at 17. She also has a strange charisma that always makes her watchable even though I don't think she's ever been in a movie that really fully takes advantage of her talents. This movie has her blasting away with a hunting rifle riding a bike straight down a hill and into a lake without the benefit of a Hollywood stunt double and having wild sex with two guys at a time. But her performance becomes much more subtle and nuanced by the end. She really carries this whole film and while it's not exactly good she certainly makes it interesting at least.".

However in the acting school she lacks self confidence to uninhibitedly storm the stage. After the well known director Kasper Friedemann invites Fine for an audition she convinces him with her acting. But he also sees in Fine an injured being vulnerable personality that matches his vision of Camille the main character in his next play. Fine gets her first big part that she in no way wants to lose. She slips into another identity. As Camille she awakens to her femininity but through Camille Fine also loses her own strengths that she shows every day in dealing with her sister Jule.

She goes to a drama school and is auditioning for a part in a play called Camille which is to be directed by a famous theater director named Kaspar Friedmann.

Her mother who spends most of her time looking after Jule is happy on her eldest daughter's behalf but the deeper Josephine sinks into the core of her character Camille the more distant she becomes from her family.Finely and engagingly directed by German filmmaker Christian Schwochow this rhythmic fictional tale draws an intimate depiction of a complicated relationship between an actress and her director and an authentic portrayal of a young woman who whilst preparing for the main role in a play lays her heart and soul on the line exceeds her personal boundaries and takes on the persona of a severely afflicted character that drags her out of her shell.

	schema:reviewBody "Die Unsichtbare is a German movie from 2011 so it had its 5th anniversary last year. It is probably the most known work by Germany's most known motherson filmmaker duo Christian and Heide Schwochow. They received a nice deal of awards attention here and the cast got their fair share as well. Dagmar Manzel for example won a German Film Award here but I must say I am a bit baffled by this as she did not really stand out and same goes for her conominee. Instead I liked Noethen and Mhe more from the supporting cast if the former still counts as supporting. It is a relatively long movie runs for over 110 minutes and stars many big names from the German film industry. The consequence is sadly as well that several of them were really wasted. This especially applies to Corinna Harfouch and Ulrich Matthes who had virtually nothing to work with. Ronald Zehrfeld has more screen time the other two but his material is not too great here either sadly. This film is not bad but looking at the cast Schwochow had at his disposal this could have been pretty great so it is a bit of a missed opportunity.The heart and soul of the film however is young Danish actress Stine Fischer Christensen who was a pretty good casting decision here for the ugly duckling who gets seen eventually and cast for a lead character in a prestigious stage play. And when we find out about the real reasons of this casting decision it makes even more sense I guess. Here we have a good example of a film on film or a film on acting I should maybe say. The way SFC transforms more and more into her character is interesting to witness how she tries to beat her insecurities and even succeeds but still this transformation may lead her to catastrophe. Sometimes you need to be somebody else in order to really know who you actually are. I found these scenes and the scenes with the theatre group also much more significant and telling than these with her family and like I said earlier I find it strange that the German Film Academy obviously saw it the other way around. Now overall it was a pretty decent watch. Nowhere near the best of the year from Europe or even the world back in 2011 but one of the better German movies from that year. I recommend checking it out.".

This film is not bad but looking at the cast Schwochow had at his disposal this could have been pretty great so it is a bit of a missed opportunity.The heart and soul of the film however is young Danish actress Stine Fischer Christensen who was a pretty good casting decision here for the ugly duckling who gets seen eventually and cast for a lead character in a prestigious stage play. And when we find out about the real reasons of this casting decision it makes even more sense I guess. Here we have a good example of a film on film or a film on acting I should maybe say. The way SFC transforms more and more into her character is interesting to witness how she tries to beat her insecurities and even succeeds but still this transformation may lead her to catastrophe. Sometimes you need to be somebody else in order to really know who you actually are. I found these scenes and the scenes with the theatre group also much more significant and telling than these with her family and like I said earlier I find it strange that the German Film Academy obviously saw it the other way around. Now overall it was a pretty decent watch. Nowhere near the best of the year from Europe or even the world back in 2011 but one of the better German movies from that year. I recommend checking it out.";

In the 1890's the young kindhearted but naive Stavros lived in Anatolia where the Greek and Armenian minorities were repressed by the majority Turks this repression which often led to violence. Even Stavros being friends with an Armenian was frowned upon. As such Stavros dreamed of a better life  specifically in America  where as a result he could make his parents proud by his grand accomplishments. Instead his parents with most of their money sent Stavros to Constantinople to help fund the carpet shop owned by his first cousin once removed. What Stavros encountered on his journey made on foot with a small donkey made him question life in Anatolia even further. Once in Constantinople his resolve to earn the 110 Turkish pound third class fare to the United States became stronger than ever. But try after try...";

It has all the values of classic American cinema  a strong simple narrative a limpid visual style which eschews any directorial histrionics to concentrate purely on the characters.  It is the story of young men driven from their homeland and making the long voyage to America   the huddled masses yearning to be free.  The journey is long and terribly hard and even as the shore of American comes into view sacrifices still have to be made.  The end of the film is enormously powerful one of the most moving I have ever seen  the effect is still with me now 30 years after seeing it.It is the story of Kazan's father and uncle  the character who makes an appearance played by Richard Boone in Kazan's more heavily fictionalised subsequent film THE ARRANGEMENT.  It is a personal story and the simplicity of the telling seems like the end of a process of endless retelling around smokey fireplaces and before children go to sleep a family saga which has almost attained the status of myth.  The savagery of the film's first hour and the dreamlike quality of the last act make AMERICA AMERICA a genuine and powerful part of American mythology.So don't torture yourself about whether Kazan was morally and politically wrong in betraying his colleagues  see AMERICA AMERICA and you'll see why he could never have acted any differently.  Yes he was a radical and a leftist and a deeply intelligent and passionate man but he was also an immigrant  and his horror of disenfranchisement and ejection overcame his moral and political views.  Kazan may criticise aspects of its culture and politics but he loves and respects and is grateful to America above all. So he made his choice.  He could have made no other.".

	schema:reviewBody "Imagine a film like The Godfather receiving almost no audience relegated to the occasional appearance on the AMC channel barely being released on VHS or DVD and you will have some idea of the tragic fate of this lost epic masterpiece. As hard as it is to believe this may be the prolific director Elia Kazan's greatest film achievement yet hardly anyone has seen it. This is a film on the epic scale of The Godfather about a young Armenian man's escape from Turkish persecution flight from Anatolia and eventual immigration to Ellis Island  all based upon the the experiences of the director's uncle. What is also tragic is the fact that I can think of no other film which portrays the cruel persecution and genocide inflicted upon the Armenian minority by the Ottoman Turks in the early 20th century which Hitler correctly pointed to as proof that the world would look the other way at the genocide he had planned in Europe in the 1930s. Every period detail in the film is perfect from the Oscarwinning costume design to the set design Greek folk music score veteran Haskell Wexler's cinematography and acting  especially lead actor Giallelis whose intensity brings to mind some of Brando's early work.It is obvious that this film was a very personal piece of filmmaking for Kazan. And though I don't want to dwell as others do on Kazan's checkered past in his naming of communist colleagues for HUAC in the 1950s it is interesting to note a parallel in the main character Stavros' personal anguish in making the choice to leave his wealthy wife and use her money to immigrate to the United States both men made the conscious decision to drive a wedge between them and their past relationships. This is truly a film for all Americans to treasure and if I had my way I would make sure it was broadcast every 4th of July just as It's a Wonderful Life is broadcast every Christmas. As a nation of immigrants and descendants of immigrants this is a film virtually every American can relate to. I can't figure out why it is so obscure.".

As for Kazan himself this was his favorite film as it's the story of his unclea man who busted his butt to get himself to America around the turn of the century.When the movie begins Kazan himself narrates and explains that the story is about the man who is responsible for him and his family immigrating to the US. His story begins in Turkey. It's around the time in history when the Turks were about to wipe out most of the Armeniansand things for other minorities in their land in this case the Greeks weren't very good either. So a family decides to send their oldest son Stavros Stathis Giallelis to Constantiople to earn his fortuneand to be able to afford to eventually bring them all to America...and freedom. Stavros is a very very determined man...but also quite naive. Again and again he's used by people and left with nothing. But he's an amazingly resilient guy and soon he's willing to do just about anything to make the money he needs to take the ship to America.While the story is rather simple it's handled exquisitely. You can really tell that it's a labor of love as the story unfolds very slowly and patiently. This is NOT a complaintjust a statement about the writerdirector's style in the movie. It's really great what he was able to achieve with mostly inexperienced actors and nonactors. Perhaps Giallelis' performance is a bit too quiet and even stilted...but it is hard to imagine that he wasn't even an actor! Overall it's a beautiful taleand one of the most American of movies because it tells a story of immigration that most of us in the US can relate to. Even though my family was not Greek so much of the rest of the film is pretty typical of what other poor families like my own probably went through on their way to a new land. Well worth seeing and a nice history lesson.".

He yearns to live a life away from degradation Greeks in Anatolia were a despised minority. This movie shows his peregrination to America in three of the shortest hours I've ever lived. It shows a cycle of being broken and rebuilt over and again the death of illusions the obduracy of hope and the rack of desire.Haskell Wexler deserves special mention as he quite frequently produced jawdropping shots in this movie. There is a scene in this movie where Stavros is sat next to an older woman Sophia sat together like panthers watching an ape play with jackals and the electricity between them established entirely visually is a devastation.The editing from Dede Allen is similarly special and you can see that Kazan acknowledged all this creative talent as he reads out all the names of the major creative staff at the end over the credits. One particularly beautiful effect was a dissolve the last time we see Stavros' mother where her face persist on the screen for a moment almost as if she has become a ghost.You absolutely must see this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "It takes some time for Kazan's movie to find its level and it could do with some judicious pruning it lasts about three hours. The faults are mostly at the beginning it's worth sticking with it and the scenes of peasant oppression and revolt don't ring true. The casting of American players doesn't help or maybe Kanzan was just too close to his material. It is after all the story of his own family and how they came to America. He not only directs but wrote it as well and it's a subject deeply felt and which he doesn't view objectively.It picks up when the hero Stavros an unconvincing Stathis Giallelis gets to Constantinople and falls in with a rich merchant and his family and is promised in marriage to the merchant's daughter. It isn't that these scenes feel any 'truer' than the earlier scenes of poverty this is a culture that is alien to us and Kazan lays on the religious symbolism a mite too heavily but dramatically they are very well structured and observed and the performances of both Paul Mann as the merchant and Linda Marsh as his daughter are outstanding. The rest of the acting is very uneven and Giallelis is certainly no James Dean his career was shortlived.In the film's final third we follow Stavros to America and the shipboard scenes are brilliantly done. Haskell Wexler photographs them with a documentarylike realism his cinematography throughout is superb and Kazan reins in the film's penchant for melodrama only a sacrificial act of kindness strains credulity. There are several splendid sequences spread across the film and ultimately one is inclined to forgive Kazan for the occasions where it falls flat. It isn't of course in any way 'commercial' which is some kind of virtue in itself. It panders to noone but Kazan. Perhaps that makes it some kind of folly but if it is then it's a grandiose one.".

	schema:headline " One man's journey to America circa 1900";
	schema:reviewBody "Director Kazan tells the story of his uncle named Stavros in the film who grew up in Turkey and emigrated to the United States as a young man. Stravos was Greek and in the late 1800s when the movie takes place Greeks were an oppressed minority in Turkey along with the Armenians. The movie does a good job of showing how incensed Stavros is to see his father's obsequious behavior toward the Turks and he suffers humiliation in an early scene where the Turks take what they want from an ice cart without any recompense. Stavros's yearning to escape this oppression is well motivated and his feelings are no secret within the family. Seeing his outrage the family gives Stavros everything they can spare so that he can get to Constantinople to work with his uncle a rug seller. From there we follow Stavros through some difficult adventures as he pursues his monomaniacal quest to get to America. When someone says I would kill to do such and such it is usually spoken metaphorically but it becomes a reality for Stavros. The stories of Kazan's real life uncle came down to him as family history. As any tale handed down through several tellers this story gives evidence of embellishments. Whether these came down to Kazan as presented in the movie or whether he added his own we don't know but consider the chance meeting on a trail in the countryside between Stavros and Hohannes an impoverished compatriot who also is bent on getting to America. Stavros gives Hohannes his shoes and this established a bond between the two. Then years later it turns out that Stavros and Hohannes are on the same boat to America and through a complicated plot point Hohannes gives his life so that Stavros can make it. Seems to stretch believability. And I have to think that the scene where Stavros is taken for dead and happens to fall off the burial cart is overplayed.The black and white photography by Haskell Wexler is impressive. Black and white is appropriate for the stark nature of this movie there are hardly even any shades of gray in Stavros's personality. Even as much a fan of black and white as I am I was left wondering how filming this in color would change the the tone of the movie.While the forces driving Stavros to his destiny were clear in his portrayal of the man I felt that Stathis Giallelis did not emote the strength of character that Stavros must have had in order to accomplish what he did. Think of a young Anthony Quinn in this role. The last part of the movie is quite emotional. The scenes at Ellis Island are so realistic that I assume many of them come from documentary footage. Poignant to see how the ancestors of many of us born in this country came to be here.The score by Manos Hadjidakis is memorable.".

This gives the film a rougher more realistic look absent from other Kazan films of the late 50s60s.

	schema:headline " Kazan labor of love slow and sluggish.";
	schema:reviewBody "In this biographical look at an uncle's journey to America that would eventuate in his own arrival in the new land director Elia Kazan warmly and somewhat ineptly plods it out in America America. Slowly paced repetitive and morosely performed it flounders a great deal of the way as Kazan attempts but fails to turn lead Starvos Gaillias into the Greek Dean with an endless parade of long pauses in overlong scenes. The result is one slow mostly low key show.Repressed by the Turks in their own country Starvros is chosen by the family Patriarch with the family fortune to get them out of their predicament and is sent off to Constantinople to invest in a rug business with a relative. Innocent that he is he is quickly exploited and exposed to the cruel world at large of unsavory characters and systems. Befriended and betrayed he is soon destitute but eventually works his way into a situation that upon marrying the owner's daughter will set him up for life. It's all very tempting but America remains the brass ring for him and things on the domestic front dissolve and he returns to pursuing that dream.At three hours in length America America's grinding rhythm never attains much of a pace.

	onyx:emotionText "In this biographical look at an uncle's journey to America that would eventuate in his own arrival in the new land director Elia Kazan warmly and somewhat ineptly plods it out in America America. Slowly paced repetitive and morosely performed it flounders a great deal of the way as Kazan attempts but fails to turn lead Starvos Gaillias into the Greek Dean with an endless parade of long pauses in overlong scenes. The result is one slow mostly low key show.Repressed by the Turks in their own country Starvros is chosen by the family Patriarch with the family fortune to get them out of their predicament and is sent off to Constantinople to invest in a rug business with a relative. Innocent that he is he is quickly exploited and exposed to the cruel world at large of unsavory characters and systems. Befriended and betrayed he is soon destitute but eventually works his way into a situation that upon marrying the owner's daughter will set him up for life. It's all very tempting but America remains the brass ring for him and things on the domestic front dissolve and he returns to pursuing that dream.At three hours in length America America's grinding rhythm never attains much of a pace. Gaillias in the lead is all stare little emotion and incapable of stretching never mind even approach the thespian talents of a Brando or a Dean. Kazan gets around this by having his other characters perform over the top to his flat demeanor in which he is supposed to convey introspection and intent to reject the Old World but it fails miserably as Gaillias performance is bordered somewhere between comatose and zombie.

Ostensibly it's about a young man a GreekTurk struggling to emigrate to the United States but it's really about the director using the movie as a pretext to tell his own story a story that is not especially interesting. First the director demonstrates his bias toward Turks loading up the movie with stereotypical images of Turks as bullies oppressors and pettyautocrats. Then stretching plausibility to the limit the director shows the protagonist who is literally dirt poor having lost whatever meager belongings he had to thieves and prostitutes getting involved with the family of a welltodo merchant and then in what can only be ascribed to a bout of temporary insanity rejecting the possibility of marrying into the family in order to go to America. It is one thing to emigrate because you're denied opportunity it is another thing entirely to emigrate while opportunity is knocking on the door and in this movie not only is opportunity knocking for this young man it's knocking loud and clear. Then he winds up having an affair with the married wife of a rich ArmenianAmerican a part of the movie which has some dramatic moments due to the excellent acting of Katharine Balfour who gives the best performance in the movie. And finally he makes it to America by appropriating a dead man's name and then is shown shining shoes in New York City with a big smile on his face while the director in an offscreen monologue explains that over a period of years the young man manages to bring over the rest of his family. The scenes depicting his actual arrival to the United States are anticlimactic featuring one brief glimpse of the Statue of Liberty in a wide angle shot little drama there. Manhattan is depicted as a series of lights flickering in the distance not much drama there either. Given the main character's obsession with getting to America these scenes are a let down. Then there are the scenes set on Ellis Island which the director uses to impugn the American immigration officials who are portrayed as being arrogant and on the take. This alone should have been enough to convince the young man to take the next boat back to Turkey beg his fianc's forgiveness marry her acquire his fatherinlaw's business make a lot of money and possibly buy a political office if not for himself then for one of his relatives. But he does not do it instead settling to become a shoe shiner in New York City. The movie character Forest Gump said Stupid is as stupid does. Gump must have watched this movie too. How the young man this shoe shiner gets the money to afford to bring over the rest of his family is not explained which is probably for the best. The interior cinematography is excellent the exteriors showing mountains and villages almost stock footage the actor who plays the protagonist gives a credible performance and the rest of the cast does good work. It's the story and the director's apparent need to focus on himself that brings this movie down.".

I really don't understand the cult of Kazan  I wonder if sometimes he doesn't benefit from a kind of reverse discrimination  some people just determined to like the films  good or bad  just to spite those who feel so strongly about his political  ethical behavior in the 1950's. FYI  from what I understand of it all I can't say that I think he behaved as well as possible but I have no problem separating that from his movies. The movie is pretty in some parts but I found the acting to be clichd and hackneyed. The dialogue was worse and was aggravated by the fact that the actors were apparently all directed or at least allowed  to SHOUT LOTS OF THEIR LINES to show that they are a heartfelt peasant folk wearing their emotions on their sleeves? Or maybe just to try to keep the audience awake. The fact that most of them do it with a Lower East Side New York accent is just a bonus. Except the lead who somehow picked up a Greekish accent it starts to sound more Latino as the movie goes on in a village where his parents and neighbors sound like Anne Bancroft and Mel Brooks no wonder he wants to go to America. But he doesn't talk so much  his specialty seems to be long dark smoldering looks. I guess the looks are meant to substitute for motive  while he is obsessed with getting to America it's hard to believe that his desire to do so overwhelms the other opportunities he's presented with in Constantinople  frankly he ends up seeming a bit simpleminded throughout the film.I agree with the commentator who noted that there aren't a lot of movies that deal with the Armenian genocide but I don't see where that means you should celebrate a bad one especially one that is really about the Greeks anyway not that they were treated well by the Turks either. I certainly don't think that a movie that perpetuates every dumb stereotype about Greeks and Turks and immigrants and Americans come to think of it is anything worth getting excited about. I'd say the only reason to rush to get this one on DVD is that it'd be easier to fast forward through it than on VHS.".

	schema:reviewBody "As the Ottoman Empire's stability crumbled in the nineteenth century as a result of internal corruption and perceived outside threats oppression and intolerance of Greek and Armenian minorities multiplied. Pogroms organized by the Sultan in 1895 and 1896 resulted in the deaths of 200000 Armenians and the displacement of thousands of Greeks many of whom looked to America as a salvation. Between 1890 and 1917 450000 Greeks 90 male arrived in the U.S. seeking freedom and opportunity. One of their stories is told by director Elia Kazan in his 1963 film America America based on his novel of his uncle's journey to America in 1896 from his homeland of Anatolia. The film was nominated for an Oscar for Best Picture but lost to Tom Jones.Shot by legendary cinematographer Haskell Wexler in blackandwhite using nonprofessional actors America America is the story of a young Greek Stavros Topouzoglou Stathis Giallelis and the enormous obstacles he faces in trying to reach America's golden shores. Under Wexler's guidance the film has the look and feel of a documentary marred only by its awkward dubbing Stavros' grandmother for example sounding like Sadie from Brooklyn. As the film opens we hear the words of the director I'm Elia Kazan. I am a Greek by blood a Turk by birth and an American because my uncle made a journey. After Vartan Frank Wolff a close Armenian friend of Stavros is murdered by the Turks and Stavros is dismayed by his father's compromising attitude towards the Turkish oppressors he is entrusted by his parents Isaac Harry Davis and Vasso Elena Karam with all of the family's wealth and sent on a twohour journey to Constantinople to join his cousin Odysseus Salem Ludwig in the rug business. Along the way however Stavros is robbed by the despicable thief Abdul Lou Antonio who pretends to be his friend but betrays him and takes of all of his wealth. Penniless but still determined to go to America Stavros rejects the offer of an arranged marriage with the daughter Linda Marsh of a wealthy rug dealer even though she is devoted to him and can look past his deceitful purposes.He is able however to use his dowry money to buy a thirdclass passage to the United States but must first get past additional and seemingly impossible obstacles once onboard ship and eventually must rely on the sacrifice of a young Armenian indentured shoeshine boy Hohanness Gardashian Gregory Rozakis. America America is obviously a heartfelt and personal film for Mr. Kazan but will never be thought of in the same light as On The Waterfront and A Streetcar Named Desire even though it is said to be Kazan's favorite.There are segments that are authentic including the scene at Ellis Island when the passengers wait for their turn to be approved or denied and also those involving Ms. Marsh and Katherine Balfour a lonely wife Stavros entertains aboard ship. While the film is a powerful rendering of the immigrant experience it never becomes a cohesive whole. Limited by a banal script an unwieldy running time a lack of character growth and a lead actor whose expression ranges from dour to morose America America ultimately stumbles in its attempt at being a work of true epic stature.".

In a comment made in a recent blog the writer couldn't understand the desire of the immigrants to come to this country. The passion and the hope these immigrants had only could be understood by someone old enough to experience the whole immigrant movement of the 20's 30's and 40's. The film itself has beautifully filmed images and a great film score. The film itself has been available as a PAL DVD and regional title in Europe and has not been released here in anything but VHS. Occasionally it is shown on AMC but not too often. It appears that it has been tied up with some sort of legal issue. It is a perfect film for the Criterion Collection.".

I wrongly assumed coming into the film that it was primarily set here in the States and would be about the immigrant experience at the turn of the last century. But our hero only reaches America in the last few minutes of the film the rest is about his dogged determination to scrape together the cost of a ticket to cross the ocean including a chapter that shows him coming into material comfort through a strategic marriage and that threatens his resolve with the complacency that comes with a Greek middle class existence. I suppose the film could be accused of sugar coating the immigrant experience. It ends before we see the slums and difficult lives many immigrants were relegated to once they arrived. On the other hand it also shows what the immigrants were fleeing in the first place and makes the case that the hardships to be found in America are better than those to be found elsewhere.America America has taken on a renewed relevance in our current cultural climate that throws suspicion on immigrants and argues that America should return to a form of isolationism. Also I have to believe this film inspired later filmmakers notably Francis Ford Coppola as the fingerprints of this film are all over Coppola's The Godfather Part II.Though little known now America America was a Best Picture nominee in 1963 and Kazan was also nominated for Best Director and Best Original Story and Screenplay. Gene Callahan won that year's award for Best BW Art Direction.Grade A".

	schema:reviewBody "In the Nineteenth Century in Italy the atheist and aristocrat Tullio Hermil Giancarlo Giannini is married with Giuliana Hermil Laura Antonelli and has a paramour Teresa Raffo Jennifer O'Neill. He decides to leave his wife and to stay with Teresa but after a period she dispenses with him. Tullio comes back to his wife but she had an affair with a writer friend of his brother and is pregnant. Tullio asks Giuliana to make an abort but she refuses. When the child is born Tullio hates him but Giuliana tries to protect the baby. In the end a tragedy happens. This movie is an intense drama and certainly not indicated for a general public. The cast has an outstanding performance under the magnificent direction of Luchino Visconti. The movie shows also a wonderful and very detailed reconstitution of the Italian aristocracy in the Nineteenth Century. The very sad story does not bring redemption to any character. In Brazil it is only available on VHS but it deserves to be offered to the viewers by the distributors on DVD to highlight the beauty of the scenes. My vote is eight.Title Brazil O Inocente' The Innocent'".

While they look great they also move at a glacial place and feature characters I really couldn't care less for...and this makes for very slow viewing. Artsy folks and critics LOVE films like The Leopard The Damned and Death in Venice I just found them to be overlong and curiously uninvolving.I could say all this about Visconti's final film L'Innocente a film that once again looks great but also have no one in the film that you care one bit about as well as glacial pacing. Even the sight of an incredibly beautiful naked woman in some incredibly graphic scenes weren't enough to make the film interesting something that is VERY difficult to achieve. I could talk about the story but frankly it COULD have been interesting...but wasn't. My only thrill came at the end when one of the characters killed themselves...at least then I knew it was finally complete!".

Rather childishly most professional critics seem to have taken umbrage against the fact that Kirchberger wasn't a professional actress but  so the legend went  a mere dental technician who was scouted by the director in some furniture catalog. Oh my god an actress who's had a real job  let's heat up the pyre! Another criticism seems to have been that the movie's visual style wasn't gritty and realistic enough  which is also way off point like criticizing a Vietnam war movie for not containing enough scenes with werewolves.Overall the movie really lacks some sort of plot it's mostly a bold superficial vision of a neonlit world where all women are gorgeous and prey on men.

	schema:reviewBody "Die Venusfalle is an awardwinning West German movie from 1988 so this one will have its 30th anniversary next year already. It runs for 100 minutes and is perhaps the most known filmmaking effort by writer and director Robert van Ackeren. And although he was only around the age of 40 when he shot it this is one of his final works. It is also still somewhat known today at least here in Germany and it may still be the careerdefining work for actress Sonja Kirchberger but I am not really sure why people have not forgotten about it. Yes it is an awardwinning movie but really not on a level where the reception was anything special really. Zischler and Zacher are also known today here in Germany but the rest of the cast are fairly unknown and there are no huge names involved here. I assume the reason why the film is still known to many may be a mix of the controversy and sexuality even if the latter is not really on a level where it shocked me or aroused me just one bit. Sure the women in here are kinda hot but so are the women in a thousand other movies. Maybe the suggestive title The Venus Trap helped the film's popularity. Unfortunately I must say the acting and even more so the script weren't remotely memorable at any point of these over 1.5 hours. In addition the film had more many more than just one moment when it dragged considerably and had just too many lengths. The film is not a failure but there also isn't a single reason why it would stand out compared to other German films from the 1980s. Thumbsdown. Don't watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "Producer Towers was very big on stories in which people are picked off one after the other. He produced screen versions of Agatha Christie's Ten Little Indians three times! While this film isn't exactly in the same vein it does feature as part of its plot line five men who are connected by an event during the war being killed one at a time the first one being during the war. Former Tarzan Barker plays a hired detective placed in charge by Rilla of finding out who is behind the slayings before Rilla's turn comes about. As he pokes around South Africa trying to uncover the killer's identity he is allied with a local police inspector Fraser and distracted by two very curvy and very bighaired ladies. Smyrner is Rilla's blonde Danish assistant and Vendell is his brunette adoptive daughter. Barker is unable to figure out the mystery or to keep the body count at bay until all is revealed at the end in a fairly surprising finale. Barker is still fit and unbelievably tan here though obviously older than when he swung from the vines and cavorted with his onetime wife Lana Turner. He gives a decent performance doing a large amount of his own stunts and only looking awkward or in any way foolish when he is mired in some tentative love scenes with the ladies. It's asking a lot of the audience to believe that Fraser is the chick magnet that he's portrayed to be here. There's nothing wrong with his acting but that aspect of his character is ludicrous with Fraser in the role unless he has about 12 undisclosed secrets no one knows about. Smyrner is pretty weak. Her lines like many peoples' in this international cast aren't always completely discernible and she's content to smile prettily rather than display any significant emotion in her scenes. Vendell has the spicier role though she's not exactly amazing either. Both gals show off some serious curves and use enough hairspray that they should have their own ozone hole named after them! The setting of Capetown is amply exploited with some really interesting locations and varieties of terrain. There doesn't appear to be much if any rear projection here. The cinematography by no less than Nicholas Roeg! manages to capture the local color in a reasonably captivating way especially in a vertigoinducing scene atop a jagged cliff. The music has a bouncy swingy feel to it that may annoy as many viewers as it pleases depending on one's taste. In this relatively tame film there is one awfully bloody death scene that also includes an actor mumbling a long stream of last words that unfortunately reveal aspects of the plot but good luck understanding him! The revelation of the killer is thankfully a bit less obvious than it seems as if it's going to be and that helps make the film better that it could have been. As it stands it's a soso mystery whose chief assets are the strong arms and sunkissed smile of Barker and the interesting location work.".

Despite a few shoehornedin fight scenes this is dull bythenumbers stuff in which little happens to lift the story out of its lethargic gloom. Barker tours the country for a while indulges in some light romance with a string of Eurocrumpet in scenes reminiscent of a Connery Bond flick and finally tackles the villain whose identity is revealed at the climax.The cast put in strictly ordinary performances and Barker fails to show even an ounce of charisma so you end up wondering why was such a star of his day. He looks a little like a young Stephen Baldwin to me. Some of the action sequences are okay like an impressive car chase early on but for the most part this is a chore and rightly forgotten.".

Purposefully noticeable was the absence of any of Apartheidera South Africa but as someone else has mentioned 'District Six' is stated by Fraser's character which was a former area 'cleared' and forgotten about by the South African government a few years later in its 'Group Areas Act' of ethnic cleansing well that's not what they called it but it was of sorts! This was obviously a nice cheap holiday to South Africa and much cheaper once they were there already.

Of note though is Gert Van Den Bergh who being South AfricanSouth African set hadn't appeared in a lot other than any film set in that beautiful country  he was mostly remembered for his one and only largescale epic film 'Zulu' as Ardendorff the Boer.";

The movie turned out to be not quite as annoying but that's not saying a lot.It does feature some nice settings costumes and camera work. Therefore its trailer might fool you into expecting something worthwhile. Contentwise it just shows several scenes from the very different lifes of Alexander von Humboldt 17691859 and Carl Friedrich Gau 17771855.Humboldt is an aristocrat occupied with basic research in the fields of geography and biology. Most of the time we see badly thought out scenes from his travels through the Amazon rainforest. Gau is a natural born genius. He comes from very humble beginnings and manages to become an internationally renowned mathematician. He's only interested in numbers and women well mostly women because numbers don't look that well on film. One is having dangerous adventures in terrae incognitae the other one sits and thinks. Yet they are both doing science. Isn't that amazing? No. Like apples and oranges they are just different  so what? As this Parallel Livesthing is the main idea of the novel and the movie both are fundamentally pointless.Leading man Albrecht Schuch Humboldt sometimes doesn't look  and sound!  like a professional actor at all. But the dramatic arts really hit rock bottom when Michael Maertens Duke and Max Giermann show up acting like the worst buffoons ever. It's really hurtful to watch their scenes. This time it's the fault of the director Buck and his lowbrow sense of humor. The same applies to the last 20 minutes. Decades later in 1828 Humboldt and Gau finally meet and their thesps deliver an overkill of hammy old manacting rewarding everyone strong enough to be still watching with an incredible cringefest including urinary incontinence and senile stubbornness bordering sociopathic behavior. Gau was just 51 years old Humboldt almost lived to see his 90th birthday 31 years later. Showing them as frail old crocks in 1828 is just another blatant lie. No people didn't wither away at the age of 30 as some think fooled by statistics. Of course the author makes his Gau utter some nonsense about statistics too. It figures.What's the use of a movie like this? It doesn't give us a story just fake biographical sketches. It is only very loosely based on historical facts. Its author and its director don't even try to understand the protagonists or to develop a sense of the time depicted. They just mock their ancestors and ridicule men once considered as great but today nearly forgotten parading their selfrighteous zeitgeisty attitude. That's poor taste pathetic. A movie for little minds. Bad German MoviesReview No. 13".

	schema:reviewBody "Die Vermessung der Welt is written adapted from Daniel Kehlmann's novel and directed by Detlev Buck one of Germany's most notable filmmakers these days and at the same time a very prolific and successful actor himself. Most recently he worked on two children's films about the little witch Bibi Blocksberg.Here the topic is slightly more serious though. We find out about the lives achievements and struggles of notable Germans explorer Alexander von Humboldt and mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss. The latter is played by Florian David Fitz one of Germany's rising stars in recent years. If you are interested in German movies you may have seen him on the two Mnnerherzen films or Vincent will Meer. Humboldt is played by Albrecht Schuch his voice reminded me of Christian Ulmen's who is not as prolific and known as his counterpart. He is the younger brother from actress Karoline Schuch and has not appeared in theatrical releases since Die Vermessung der Welt only in some TV productions. I have to say that I found it a bit random how the movie was about both these men. There seemed to be hardly no connection early on. Obviously their final meeting sitting in prison together makes up for this issue a bit but it still looks a bit random and maybe two films one about each would have worked better. However this does not mean that it was a weak film. I enjoyed it occasionally and it has good small supporting performances from Max Giermann Katharina Thalbach and mostly Karl Markovics who is a joy to watch in everything he is in. Matthias Schweighfer plays a small part as well.All in all I felt the dialogs could have been a bit better. However the costumes were nice and visually it was a good film. A bit style over substance though even if I liked the way it portrayed Gauss' struggles with how he never got to meet people who were on his level intellectually which almost drove him into suicide. The Immanuel Kant meeting scene was one of my favorites. Still I believe the topic was interesting enough to be the basis for a much better film than this actually turned out to be in the end. I felt it came a bit short on emotional levels. Still I would recommend it to those with an interest in German cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is based on a successful novel that contrasts the life of two eminent scientists of the mathematician and founder of numbers theory CF Gauss and the adventurer and explorer of South America and the rest of the world Alexander von Humboldt. They come from the same locale Brunswick in Germany and are about the same age but Gauss rises from poverty whereas Humboldt is privileged. And whereas Gauss doesn't like to leave his office and rarely travels Humboldt does practically nothing but to travel.The original novel which I haven't read was apparently completely rewritten by the author himself for the script. The film is lavish and opulent and bears the characteristic sarcasm of its director Detlev Buck. The duke of Brunswick for example is portrayed as a well meaning nitwit who can't remotely grasp what young Gauss is on about whereas Gauss is portrayed as a nerd and an eccentric. The movie is entertaining but almost a bit too opulent for my taste. As always I hope that it will inspire its viewers to pick up the biographies.".

	schema:reviewBody "Die Vermissten or Reported Missing is a German movie from 2012 so this one has its 5th anniversary this year. It is relatively short barely makes it past the 80minute mark and it is the probably most known work by writer and director Jan Speckenbach. But this also keeps the film somewhat essential. This is the tale of what happens when a father goes on the search for his missing daughter. It becomes obvious that at least one other child has gone missing later on even more. The lead actor is Andr Hennicke and I found it nice to see him play a central character for once with all the supporting stuff he usually does. He certainly elevates the material by a lot here. As for the film itself it was probably at its best early on when we see him search for the girl and the revelation what actually happened comes pretty quickly afterward and I did not find it too convincing. The wall of silence about these events rarely makes sense to me and the explanation why families and police or politics even won't do anything did not really feel too convincing for me. Also the character of Lou basically the interface between the main character and his daughter did not add as much quality as I would have hoped especially looking at how crucial her character is. Admittedly the way she goes out of the picture shows that it is somewhat daring in terms of the writing and I also really liked the final haunting shot of the father looking down at his daughter among the group. Finally not a forced happy ending but something that feels real and authentic and actually also offers some solid room for discussion. Did he realize this moment she is where she belongs? Or is his face expression and rigidity in that moment just pure shock? What is he gonna do next? Is the fact that it ends there an indicator of how the story also ends for him in his attempts of getting his daughter back? What is he gonna do next? It's all wide open. Anyway while I think it was an okay watch i also think the film got slightly worse around the 30minute mark with all the revelations happening quickly at that point. It is a pretty solid movie but still a missed opportunity at the same time and it could have been one of the best films of 2012 if they had chosen another explanation behind the missing or at least elaborated more convincingly on the path they took. Still because of Hennicke's strong performance and some other solid moments I give this one a thumbsup and recommend checking it out.".

He's a master at crafting genuinely tense intriguing moments out of mere subtleties. His films are so superbly characterdriven without any of the artifice of many contemporary or shall I say Hollywood films that we are drawn into their stories without realizing it.In Monsieur Hire Leconte takes the story of a peeping tom and turns it into an unpretentious gripping sly romantic thriller. It initially reminded me of The Cry of the Owl 1987 but works on a much deeper more human and satisfying level than Claude Chabrol's thriller.Hire brilliantly played by Michel Blanc is a balding lonely middleaged introvert whose only sense of comfort comes from watching a beautiful young woman Alice a gorgeous Sandrine Bonnaire through her bedroom window. But Alice finds herself strangely attracted to this recluse though Leconte always keeps us wondering whether she has ulterior motives. After all Hire certainly is not Alice's type. And is nothing like her fianc Emile.In a mere 80 minutes or so Leconte packs more suspense intrigue and sensuality into his film than most twohour thrillers. A scene involving Alice gently picking up tomatoes around Hire's feet and another at a boxing match are infinitely sexier than anything Paul Verhoeven Adrian Lyne or countless other directors of sexy thrillers could have conjured up. And Leconte achieves this without any dialogue or even the slightest hint of nudity.Elegant smart sophisticated and seductive Monsieur Hire slowly creeps up on you and holds you in its web until its perfect conclusion.

The above mentioned films take an idea for a story a dinosaur filled wildlife park or a mysterious religious secret and then devise a plot which is by far and away beyond what would ever happen in the real world.In contrast Monsieur Hire takes a story in which very little happens A man is suspected of a murder. The man is a reclusive misfit devoid of charm or humour but he harbours a love for a woman he has never even met a woman he knows only through seeing her from his apartment window. Unlike the aforementioned films the plot from beginning to end can be summarised within just a few sentences. But it is what is behind the plot which makes this movie incredible. It is the notion of love which drives the film.The acting and directing show passion that is more intense and sexual than anything I have seen yet it does so without even a hint of what you would expect from a film described as intense and sexual. The intensity of the love shown by the protagonist is beyond anything that one would have seen before and yet it is far from the purity that one would normally associate with such an emotion. Indeed it is dark and tense and due to the questionable character of its object one is left in turmoil as to whether this love is to be admired pitied or instead viewed as just desserts for a man of his nature.Those who have scored this low on the basis that the characters do not conduct themselves in a believable way confound me. The whole point of a film is that it takes you away from the everyday scenario. Most movies show you fairly ordinary people involved in extraordinary stories. This one shows you extraordinary characters involved in a story which in itself is fairly ordinary. To score this low based on its plot is to criticise Opera for its storyline. The whole point of the opera is its music and the whole point of this film is its incredible portrayal of emotion. Brilliantly acted brilliantly directed and this will haunt you for some time.If you need your films to be Hollywood factory typecasts then don't watch this. You won't enjoy it. Go and rent out The Expendibles and leave Monsieur Hire to those who appreciate art when they see it. I'm sorry if that sounds pretentious. I enjoy a cheesy Hollywood flick as much as the next person but it's sad that there are people who can't see beyond Stephen Spielberg Tom Hanks and Bruce Willis.".

Go and rent out The Expendibles and leave Monsieur Hire to those who appreciate art when they see it. I'm sorry if that sounds pretentious. I enjoy a cheesy Hollywood flick as much as the next person but it's sad that there are people who can't see beyond Stephen Spielberg Tom Hanks and Bruce Willis.";

A young man and woman are lovers and she is watched by her neighbor the unpopular Mr. Hire black sheep of a Paris nearsuburban nabe. They begin a friendship and even a relationship of sorts while a cop tries to pin the murder of a young local girl also an odd duck on Mr. Hire. Not wanting to spoil the story for you I won't say more except to say that the slow parts are tolerable if you know in advance that this is a very thoughtful haunting movie and you've got to be a little patient for the wonderful reward which comes right at the end. Very pretty music beautiful colors and details lots of sad little moments that remind you of the loneliness of daily life. I wouldn't actually recommend this to most people. I don't think they'd tolerate the lack of Hollywood flash. If you're smart you'll watch it though. I got it on DVD at a public library and wish I could see it on a big screen though the DVD images are very lovely.".

When Alice accidentally sees Mr. Hire she surprisingly visits him and he discloses that he is in love with her. Further he tells that he had witnessed Emile killing Pierrette but he had not told the police since she would be considered accomplice of the murder. Mr. Hire invites Alice to travel with him to Lausanne Switzerland and leave Emile behind. This is the second time that I watch Monsieur Hire released in Brasil on VHS by Abril Video in the 90's and it is a gloomy little gem of Patrice Leconte. The slow pace gives a perfect development of the personality of the lead character in a awesome performance of Michel Blanc. Sandrine Bonnaire has also a topnotch performance in the role of a manipulative woman. The conclusion is also magnificent with the explanation of the omission of Mr. Hire.

This involves sinister trappings of the utmost order.A murder of a young girl in his neighbourhood sparks off rumours. Hire's neighbours talk while the inspector listens. Very often he claims the one that seems guilty is guilty. Monsieur Hire is not remotely intimidated he rightly attributes their suspicions to his seemingly misanthropic persona. Living alone he dresses in the same suit each day goes to work while strictly keeping his greetings formal and uninformative and comes home to a simple inelegant dinner of a hardboiled egg. You see Monsieur Hire is not a hermit he does not suffer from agoraphobia nor does he fear people. It's a lifestyle that he's taken up due to mistrust of others even perhaps a snobbish contempt of others. As per the inspector's investigations he finds Hire bowling rather flamboyantly entertaining the rest of the bowlers. He's their king. But when returning home he is ridiculed by the children he stays annoyed but does not grow scornful of them. One can still detect that he's more open to them than the adults.The murder mystery takes a backseat to Hire. It's a taut compelling character study that flows beautifully. It's structured so well and acted on so marvelously by Michel Blanc who helmed The Escort my next rental who effuses such a subtle sad anger that defeats the man Hire obviously wants to be. And subtly is something Monsieur Hire does brilliantly when he's allowed to see but not touch and allowed to touch but never feel. There's so much to be said for composing shots that hide behind exteriors afraid to discover the intricacies of their maiden relationship. Leconte observes on the level of Hire. He photographs and captures a scene in its absoluteness lingering just long enough for us to absorb its significance but switches it fast enough for us to want to know more.Hire has a rather unsettling pasttime involving the woman who lives across from him a floor below. Like clockwork each day he looks and sees everything she does as though entranced with her life. She does notice him one day shocked initially but then becomes interested in him. He does not want to admit that he's finding her company pleasant. Complicating their relationship is her boyfriend oblivious to Hire but obviously no less painful for Hire to see. It's such a sensual affair poignant as anything you could hope to see. Look for the scene on the bus that encapsulates their relationship in a glance. My only regret is that we don't learn more about Monsieur Hire before the film rolls to a close but I believe we would have learnt more than we should about such a man.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Monsieur Hire' is a film where you can find elements of horror mystery romance and comedy blending with each other and the result is a really endearing piece of work.This is a film that is majorly about the deceptiveness of appearances. 'Monsieur Hire explores the distinctions between what appears to be the truth and what is the actual truth both in terms of facts and in terms of the nature of characters. Patrice Leconte uses the the screenplay and his camera to play around with the viewers with certain misleading shots and by deliberately withholding information. Certain ideas get set up in the minds of the viewer but these ideas get undercut and turned on their heads with the unearthing of the actual truths towards the later parts of the film.Patrice Leconte's style of artistically using the lighting and his way of establishing thematic and character conflicts by the using of colourblue and red reminded me of Kielowski. 'Monsieur Hire' foreshadows films like 'The Double Life of Veronique' and 'Three Colours trilogy'. It also has a Hitchcocklike vibe to it in the way the film keeps the viewer guessing and on the edge of the seat with the way the mystery elements are handled. The camera movements are fluid especially the sideways movement which at times contradict the movement of the characters in the scene. The beautiful operatic score helps Leconte to establish the theatrically poetic vibe that he is going for.'Monsieur Hire' is driven forward by a dynamic passionate and tender performance by Michel Blanc. He has to play a character who stays completely detached from the rest of the world is very unsociable and not at all gregarious. Maybe similarities can be drawn between the characters of Hire and Gerd Wiesler from 'The Lives of Others'. Blanc forces the viewer to completely sympathise with him and root for him.In a nutshell 'Monsieur Hire' is a poetic touching and visually polished piece of work that I can't help but recommend.".

	schema:headline " A moving psychological drama";
	schema:reviewBody "He is a quiet man Monsieur Hire Michel Blanc. A balding middle aged fellow a misanthrope and a recluse he doesn't socialize much. None of the neighbours talk to him either conversations die down and they start whispering as he passes by. A tailor by profession Hire is particular about his appearance. He keeps some pet white rats at home. When one of the pet rats dies he carefully wraps it in a piece of cloth and gives it a respectful water burial! He seems to be a good honest man but no one really knows much about him. Perhaps they don't want to know. But they don't miss a chance to sneak a curious peek at him like he is some alien being. When Hire realizes this he promptly snaps back Want a photograph? Some neighbourhood kids make fun of him by throwing flour on him or making fun of him. He just brushes all of this off and holds no grudge against anyone. He just isn't bothered wants to be left alone as always.It is no surprise then that when one young woman is found murdered in the vicinity he automatically becomes the prime suspect. Blame it on the neighbourhood! And more so because a taxi driver saw a figure somewhat matching Monsieur Hire's description run towards the same block where Monsieur Hire resides. The police detective starts pursuing his suspect there's no evidence yet that can implicate Hire but the detective is in hot pursuit.Monsieur Hire seems unperturbed though. There is nothing that can possibly connect him. He has just become an easy target because he is not sociable and people don't like that. So Hire goes about his daily mundane boring routine amongst his pastimes and necessities is a visit to the bowling alley he is a champion at the game and is well admired by onlookers who give him a round of applause for he never misses scoring a perfect strike even when blindfolded. He acknowledges their adulation with a forced smile. He also spends time at a brothel once in a while to satisfy his sexual needs but seems to be getting increasingly weary of it.And then there's Alice Sandrine Bonnaire his object of affection who stays in the neighbouring apartment complex. He spends most of his time standing in his window simply observing Alice through her open window directly in front of his. She has never noticed has in fact always thought that Hire's apartment was empty and therefore never felt the need to put up drapes! Hire observes Alice's every move as she dresses undresses eats sleeps and once in a while makes out with her no good fianc Emile Luc Thuillier. Hire also is a lover of music and plugs in the same record on his player the soulful Quatuor en Sol Mineur Op. 25 de Brahms every time he stands to watch Alice. Hire just wants to watch. He is in love but he knows there isn't much he can do about it. He just watches. It becomes apparent that Emile doesn't seem to be serious about marrying Alice. Alice knows this but she loves him. Everything changes one day when Alice finally gets a good look at the ghostly face that has been staring at her all this time....Director Patrice Leconte's effortless storytelling does a laudable job of building Hire's character for the viewers in a considerably short time. Right from the first frame as the body of the young woman is discovered Leconte's 1989 film Monsieur Hire has the power to grip! Sure there is a murder. But solving the murder is least of film's concerns. Who did the killing is secondary. The murder acts as a catalyst and alters the status quo. How this killing decides the fate of our two central characters that forms the crux of this heartwrenching story.In its modest running time of about 1 hour 17 minutes or so there is not one wasted moment and we can instantly connect to the two lead characters Hire and Alice. These characters are both very human. They have their secrets they have their ambitions they have their motivations and in the end they have their secret desires! And therefore not everything is out in the open not just as yet. There is a lot going on in these characters' minds which we aren't given a peek at. The voyeur in us doesn't have the kind of luck Monsieur Hire has as he gets to see Alice's life like a Live reality show! But Leconte has a purpose. For deep within the layers of this deeply moving psychological drama lies the darkest of human traits motivations that drive a person to take the step they take that might shatter all beliefs all the hope one has instilled in humanity. There are important lessons to be learnt. Oftstated idioms Don't judge a book by its cover are reinforced. Appearances are indeed deceiving.

	onyx:emotionText "He is a quiet man Monsieur Hire Michel Blanc. A balding middle aged fellow a misanthrope and a recluse he doesn't socialize much. None of the neighbours talk to him either conversations die down and they start whispering as he passes by. A tailor by profession Hire is particular about his appearance. He keeps some pet white rats at home. When one of the pet rats dies he carefully wraps it in a piece of cloth and gives it a respectful water burial! He seems to be a good honest man but no one really knows much about him. Perhaps they don't want to know. But they don't miss a chance to sneak a curious peek at him like he is some alien being. When Hire realizes this he promptly snaps back Want a photograph? Some neighbourhood kids make fun of him by throwing flour on him or making fun of him. He just brushes all of this off and holds no grudge against anyone. He just isn't bothered wants to be left alone as always.It is no surprise then that when one young woman is found murdered in the vicinity he automatically becomes the prime suspect. Blame it on the neighbourhood! And more so because a taxi driver saw a figure somewhat matching Monsieur Hire's description run towards the same block where Monsieur Hire resides. The police detective starts pursuing his suspect there's no evidence yet that can implicate Hire but the detective is in hot pursuit.Monsieur Hire seems unperturbed though. There is nothing that can possibly connect him. He has just become an easy target because he is not sociable and people don't like that. So Hire goes about his daily mundane boring routine amongst his pastimes and necessities is a visit to the bowling alley he is a champion at the game and is well admired by onlookers who give him a round of applause for he never misses scoring a perfect strike even when blindfolded. He acknowledges their adulation with a forced smile. He also spends time at a brothel once in a while to satisfy his sexual needs but seems to be getting increasingly weary of it.And then there's Alice Sandrine Bonnaire his object of affection who stays in the neighbouring apartment complex. He spends most of his time standing in his window simply observing Alice through her open window directly in front of his. She has never noticed has in fact always thought that Hire's apartment was empty and therefore never felt the need to put up drapes! Hire observes Alice's every move as she dresses undresses eats sleeps and once in a while makes out with her no good fianc Emile Luc Thuillier. Hire also is a lover of music and plugs in the same record on his player the soulful Quatuor en Sol Mineur Op. 25 de Brahms every time he stands to watch Alice. Hire just wants to watch. He is in love but he knows there isn't much he can do about it. He just watches. It becomes apparent that Emile doesn't seem to be serious about marrying Alice. Alice knows this but she loves him. Everything changes one day when Alice finally gets a good look at the ghostly face that has been staring at her all this time....Director Patrice Leconte's effortless storytelling does a laudable job of building Hire's character for the viewers in a considerably short time. Right from the first frame as the body of the young woman is discovered Leconte's 1989 film Monsieur Hire has the power to grip! Sure there is a murder. But solving the murder is least of film's concerns. Who did the killing is secondary. The murder acts as a catalyst and alters the status quo. How this killing decides the fate of our two central characters that forms the crux of this heartwrenching story.In its modest running time of about 1 hour 17 minutes or so there is not one wasted moment and we can instantly connect to the two lead characters Hire and Alice. These characters are both very human. They have their secrets they have their ambitions they have their motivations and in the end they have their secret desires! And therefore not everything is out in the open not just as yet. There is a lot going on in these characters' minds which we aren't given a peek at. The voyeur in us doesn't have the kind of luck Monsieur Hire has as he gets to see Alice's life like a Live reality show! But Leconte has a purpose. For deep within the layers of this deeply moving psychological drama lies the darkest of human traits motivations that drive a person to take the step they take that might shatter all beliefs all the hope one has instilled in humanity. There are important lessons to be learnt. Oftstated idioms Don't judge a book by its cover are reinforced. Appearances are indeed deceiving. Your curmudgeonly neglected next door neighbor could perhaps be an angel in disguise! But then there is the bigger question of trust and inherent cynicism that we social beings have to live with. How much can we know at face value? In the end we are only human! Michel Blanc instantly makes an impression his pale round face although deadpan most of the times speaks volumes at its most vulnerable.

It's actually a Reinhard Hauff movie and the script comes from Burkhard Driest. Driest worked with Fassbinder and Herzog so this was certainly inspired. He also plays the main antagonist Kuul is he really that one? in this film and was a prolific actor himself. Our antihero is played by Jrgen Prochnow in his early 20s who you may know from Das Boot. Eberhard Junkersdorf produced here and he was one of the most known German filmmakers at that time. The whole thing runs for 100 minutes and basically only plays in a prison. The protagonist gets in it right at the start for driving a vehicle in a robbery. The film ends with him being release after 4 years. Other known German actors in here include Tilo Prckner Fassbinder regular Kurt Raab Gert Haucke and Charles Brauer.The story can be summarized pretty easily with the film's title. Blum is an almost harmless good guy at the beginning but life in prison drastically roughens him up and he becomes one of the most feared and influential people inside. His intelligence helps a lot and it's his great advantage compared to Kuul. This way Blum makes up for his physical weaknesses. But still he also acts violently the first time around minute 40 after he gets beaten up by Kuul. Prochnow occasionally looked a bit like the young Clint Eastwood here in my opinion. It's a good film from start to finish not really great on any occasion and there are some expected events like the death of the inmate with the heart disease but it doesn't really hurt the overall perception of the film. The ending is truly ironic when one of the warden's tells Blum that he became an entirely different human being in these 4 years. Maybe this comment that closes the film will give you goosebumps but it's a nice example of smart dialog writing. Good watch and I recommend it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Family movies usually make me cringe. Saccharine plots cloying kiddie actors goopy dialogue...no thank you! But The Parent Trap succeeds admirably as both childrenfriendly fare and reasonably witty sophisticated comedy. The highclass production values don't hurt and neither does the superb cast right down to the character roles. The everdependable Una Merkel is a gem as the smarttalking maid  having lost none of her streetwise timing since her brassy blonde days in the 1930's. Charlie Ruggles is extraordinarily lovable as the grandfather and Cathleen Nesbitt plays wonderfully against type as the domineering grandmother. Leo G. Carroll once again benefits a film simply by his appearance and even Nancy Miss Hathaway Kulp is on board as a butch camp counselor quite a stretch. Of course at the heart of it all is the bravura performance of Hayley Mills as twins Susan and Sharon. She's never revoltingly sweetthere's a winning streak of spice in her personality that separates her from all other child stars. Plus her kicky preBeatles British accent and snubnosed beauty lend her a more worldly air than her contemporaries. The ravishing Maureen O'Hara in one of her last major roles as the twins' mother Maggie begins the film as a nondescript cipher but her glamorous metamorphosis in the latter half of the film shows just how funny and sexy she can be. Mitch the twins' father is played by the ruggedly handsome Brian Keith who generates the right mixture of roughneck toughness and paternal warmth.And the criminallyoverlooked Joanna Barnes plays Vicki the  predatory golddigger looking to sink her claws into Mitch.  Vicki's verbal duels with Maggie and the twins are surprisingly catty for a children's film and delivered with perfect villainy. The very 1961 flourishes are priceless the hopelessly tonedeaf Tommy Sands and Annette Funicello singing the theme song the formal dance with the girls all decked out in crinolines and laces Susan plastering her bungalow wall with pictures of her favorite pin up boys Rick Nelson! and my personal favorites Sharon and Susan showing each other their parents' photos hyperposed glamorous Hollywood 8x10 glossies! The plot actually plays like a highly sanitized Rock HudsonDoris Day bedroom farce except that Susan and Sharon direct the course of action. You know what the ending will be even before you watch the movie but it doesn't really matter. This is a delicious bonbon of a flick as irresistible to adults as to their children.".

But The Parent Trap succeeds admirably as both childrenfriendly fare and reasonably witty sophisticated comedy. The highclass production values don't hurt and neither does the superb cast right down to the character roles. The everdependable Una Merkel is a gem as the smarttalking maid  having lost none of her streetwise timing since her brassy blonde days in the 1930's.

	schema:reviewBody "Although the splitscreen technique had been around for a decade or so it was usually more noted for its failures than its success and the actor required to play dual roles usually took tremendous heat for their failure to create two physically identical but distinctly different characterizations on screen. But with THE PARENT TRAP with the difficult dual role resting on the shoulders of an extremely young star Walt Disney struck gold. It would be the single highest grossing film the studio had released up to that time and even some forty years later the babyboomers who flocked to see it in 1961 regard it as one of their favorite movie experiences.But THE PARENT TRAP has a lot more going for it than mere nostalgia. The cast is really really good featuring the everlikable Maureen O'Hara and Brian Keith in leading roles and a host of great character actors including Leo G. Carroll and Nancy Kulp in minor roles. And then there is Haley Mills. The daughter and sister of noted English actors Mills was no newcomer to the screen when THE PARENT TRAP went before the camerasshe had even picked up an Oscar for her earlier Disney film POLLYANNA. Even so this was no guarantee that she could pull off the feat of double roles something that had daunted even the legendary Bette Davis. But she did.The story has been told so often that surely every one knows it by now. A wife delivers twin daughtersbut shortly afterward divorces her husband and each wins custody of one child. The children are raised without any knowledge of each other's existence... until they unexpectedly bump into each other at summer camp put two and two together and devise a scheme to get their parents back together again.Even today and in spite of its familiarity it's an amusing idea and while the actual script is weak in spots the cast and especially Haley Mills makes the most of it. There's plenty of slapstick lots of laughoutloud scenes and enough charm to beguile all but the most cynical viewers. And Haley Mills clearly demonstrates why she was regarded as the single most gifted child actor of her era although she plays both Susan and Sharon with the same edge of mischievous fun they do indeed come off as completely different personalities.Of course digital technology has left the old splitscreen technique in the dust and today its easy to see the flaws in the technique that weren't so obvious at the time. And the quality of the film transfer is not the best while this isn't the worst transfer I've seen it is full of artifacts nonetheless. Even so the appeal of the story the cast and most particularly Haley Mills make up for a lot and this Disney double DVD comes complete with a host of bonuses including a makingof documentary and an audio commentary track by director David Swift and Haley Mills that fans will enjoy quite a bit.If you were a fan of the film then you'll remain a fan of it now. And if you want to introduce your family to a truly charming movie experience you couldn't make a better choice.Gary F. Taylor aka GFT Amazon Reviewer".

What will be in the next present that I open? Will I or won't I glimpse Santa sneaking around my living room? The greatest surprise of all is realizing that the little babe born in the manger is really the creator of the cosmos and of the very manger he is sleeping in.The Parent Trap is like Christmas. It brings smiles joys and surprises. Imagine going away to summer camp when you discover someone who looks exactly like you standing in the lunch line. Who are they? And why do they have your face? You mean we have the same birthday? You mean we have the same parents? WERE SIBLINGS!!! What would you do in a situation like this? Why switch places with your newly discovered sibling of course.This film has as much intrigue as a James Bond film and as much mystery as an Agatha Christie novel as the twins plot to get their divorced parents back together. It's great to have a film so blatantly say 'Divorce Really Sucks the life out of families And the Sixth Sense style surprises continue to show up throughout the film as the parents and those in the households on each side of the continent realize that the person they thought was one twin really was the other one.Sometimes when the revelation is revealed in a story the interest level seems to flatten in the storyline but not in this film. It maintains a high level of interest throughout the film. It's also interesting to note that in that the high quality special effects that were used in the picture were done in an age before computers were as sophisticated as they are today. It is really convincing that there are two Hayley Mills on the screen at the same time. I once did shot the same person on tape using two different hair styles and made it look like she was talking to herself as a different person. It's way cool to do if you know how to do that sort of thing. I also shot myself doing the 'Who's on First' routine.The movie has few flaws if any. At times I had trouble telling the two characters apart but that may be me and is not enough to mention as a real flaw. Some of the characters smoke cigarettes in plain view of children. I mean the horror of it. Overall I think cigarettes stink and are bad for children but I am not a smoking Nazi who would sponge all cigarettes from older films. There are some who would actually do this.Another neat little thing is how they talk about sexuality without actually talking about it. The innocence of a family friendly film is still intact with the reality of the meaning of sexuality and martial love weaved into the seams of the film. All of the actors are a delight to spend two hours with especially Hayley and the guy who played the minister. You also get to witness Hayley kicking the crap out of herself. It's rare you see a good girl fight on film. It's sexist that only men kick the crap out of each other and never women.Part of the reason I loved this film as much as I did in my reviewing of it is because I was impressed and pleased that Disney could produce such a high quality mature looking film. This film is not just good for Disney its' a good film in general. Any Disney slapstick happens as a result of the story and not as a result to just get laughs.This is not worth a rental it's worth buying and keeping and sharing with loved ones. Rent it by all means if you don't have the money to buy it. This film is Pure Movie Magic. Disney Gold A warning Don't be tempted to watch the sequel that is on the same DVD disc it's bad as the original is good. If the original is Charismas the sequel is Tax Day eve.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is an agreeable updating from an E. Kastner's story  it deals about two twins little girls Hayley Mills. When they are in summer holidays and after several antics each other  discover the surprise which they are twin sisters and then they plot change characters with their different parents Mauren O'Hara  Brian Keith who are disjointed since the divorce and the girls have been separately raised . The father is going to marry a young woman Joanna Barnes and the elevenyearsold girls scheme the parents reconciliation by making impossible life of the father's bride .The picture contains enjoyable comedy  humor  tongueincheek and being pretty entertaining . This classical Disney comedy was remade in 1998 with Lindsay Lohan and previously adapted to British cinema in a movie titled  Twice upon a time 1954 . Hayley Mills acting is sympathetic and amusing . Hayley plays two sisters and she makes it splendidly . Hayley starred two sequels for Television 1986 1989. Susan Henning took on the role as Hayley Mills' body double for several of the twin shots in the film  as part of her contract she signed away her rights to be credited . The screenplay originally called for only a few trick photography shots of Hayley Mills in scenes with herself the bulk of the film was to be shot using a body double. When Walt Disney saw how seamless the processed shots were  he ordered the script reconfigured to include more of the special effect . Mauren O'Hara and Brian Keith are magnificent as parents in similar roles later starred by Natasha Richardson and Dennis Quaid . Joanna Barnes as the unpleasant fiance is very well  in the remake she played the bride's incarnated by Elaine Hendrix mother . The movie will appeal to family comedy enthusiasts . Rating  Amusing and enjoyable . Well worth seeing .".

	schema:reviewBody "After watching the 1998 remake with Lindsay Lohan I had to check out the 60's version which I thought was unbelievably filmed well! Firstly before I start ranting on how great the film was I will say that I don't think that this film doesn't match the remake. Usually I find remade films worse or less superior than the originals but for some reason I just found some more fun in the remake. The original however I think is still excellent and should still be viewed.The plot centers on two twins who discover each other at a girls camp. They find out who each other's parents are and then they decide to concock a mischievous plan into swapping places and getting to know each other's parents before meeting again trying to reunite their parents.The acting scenery and settings music score unique moments and memorable scenes were put together very well and the entire film still holds up to today's standards.My first thoughts were that the film wasn't going to be great at all and that it wasn't going to beat the remake. I was wrong about it being a well made masterpiece but I was right about it not beating the remake in my opinion.I thought everything was a little different and more absurd whilst I still found more moments especially the woods scenes. However I did find the music a little bit too typical very 50's60's styled themed music it sounded like anything else.Overall I do love this film. I don't have anything negative to say about it but there's just something about the remake which I found more special but then again if we didn't have this film we wouldn't have the remake!!! Anyway I really believe the film is one of the best 1960's films ranking right up with 60's horror such as Black Sabbath and Rosemary's Baby. 8.510".

	schema:headline " Mischievous lively  fun twin antics but a bizarre premise";
	schema:reviewBody "I've always been a huge fan of Hayley Mills and grew up with her in this type of movie. Like everyone else I always just figured it was cute and heartwarming then got to thinking...and I see at least one other reviewer agrees with me.This Disney family classic tells the story of two twins Susan and Sharon whose parents divorced shortly after their birth. Each parent assumed custody of one of their daughters so these twins have been unaware they have a sister. However the pair inadvertently meet at summer camp recognize each other of course they're identical and decide to switch places by going to live for awhile with the opposite parent. Then the scheming but appealing duo embarks upon a mission to reunite their divorced parents despite the fact that the father is now engaged to another rather nasty and not at all suitable woman.First Hayley Mills is of course an absolutely fabulous little actress here playing the dual roles of the sisters Sharon and Susan. She's bubbly perky endearing charming and all the rest of it plus makes you believe there really are two different girls. Also the parents are well cast with the rugged Brian Keith portraying the father and the beautiful sophisticated Maureen O'Hara as the mother.However I agree totally with another reviewer that questions...what kind of strange cruel uncaring parents would split up their kids like this? Talk about dividing assets! It seems these twins have essentially no contact or awareness of the non custodial parent in addition to being quite oblivious that they have a twin sibling. Furthermore it is incredible that these parents seem to want no contact with their non custodial child. Such a parent does not come across as very heartwarming to me even if played by Brian Keith and Maureen O'Hara! Thus the basic premise behind this tale is beyond bizarre. Of course the cute antics of the twins get the parents back together in the end. If this estranged couple is so easily reunited one wonders why they ever divorced in the first place. However I could forgive this...we all want a happily ever after ending here...but not the splitting up your children in infancy business.Anyway it's a lively light hearted entertaining little movie that's fun to watch lots of mischievous pranks and so on. But as for a 'family film' it has some strange messages. Parents should discuss some of these issues with their own kids while watching it whether or not they themselves are in a divorced situation. My own child did not grow up with divorced parents but I would still have wanted to make it plain...this is Disney and makes a cute story but dividing up your children like this denying them knowledge of their sibling or noncustodial parent isn't remotely acceptable in real life.As far as the new 1998 version is concerned this 1961 Hayley Mills one is a classic and perfectly fine just the way it is. Why must Hollywood always feel compelled to do remakes? It's like they don't believe modern audiences can relate if the hairstyles or whatever are a little different. Absurd!".

This is a movie that reminds us that marriages even bad ones are worth working out and fighting for a message that is missing in so many Hollywood movies these days. Look for really charming Oscarworthy in my opinion performances by Una Merkel Verbeena and Charles Ruggles Charles McKendrick. SPOILER ALERT The scene where the twins first realize who they are and what happened is classic and worth the price of a rental by itself. The dance number Let's Get Together which the twins perform again later in the movie is memorable and you'll be singing it to yourself for weeks later!

I don't think that you have to be a twin to have fun with this movie. It is a delight on all levels.Maureen O'Hara at the height of her great beauty in this film and the ruggedly handsome Brian Keith are perfectly cast in their roles as the twins divorced parents. A great cast of supporting players that include Charles Ruggles Una Merkel Joanna Barnes and Leo G. Carroll just add to the talent that went into making this picture. They just don't make movies like this anymore family movies that are great for everyone to watch without being overly sappy or dull. It makes me long for the good old days.For a fun family movie night don't waste your time on the remake with Lindsey Lohan.

Unable to accept that their parents don't still love one another they scheme to reunite the folks by switching places. Although I found it kind of strange that 2 Americans would have one twin with a British accent I realized the maternal Grandmother is also sort of British. It doesn't matter anyway Mills is too cute. I really love Keith because he brought a realistic sense of humor as the flabbergasted Dad who just wants to remarry with some young broad and pretend he's moving on with his life!!! O'Hara is also more than a pretty face. She's hilarious. This film is colorful fun and just sexy enough not to be boring to adults. I love it.".

It allows us to benefit in part thanks to the then revolutionary split screen technique from a great performance by two Hayley Mills instead of one! The story of twin sisters discovering each other at a summer camp and trying to rebuild their broken home is very endearing. Yet the emotion is well balanced with refreshing humor and quid pro quo situations. The cast is superb and it is worth mentioning the magnificent acting by the ever beautiful Maureen O'Hara and masculine Brian Keith. There is also a great appearance by Hitchcockien Leo G. Carroll in the role of a really funny Reverend. Still center stage is Hayley Mills 15 years old when the film was released always funny witty and really enchanting. Eventually looking back at it now The Parent Trap also in my opinion send us a feeling of nostalgia like a frozen time capsule of the early 1960's.".

One flaw though is the English accent Hayley falls in and out of but it's such a minor flaw that most people would either not notice or not care. It would have helped for Sharon to be from London like the remake instead of Boston. This film also displays beautiful homes and scenery. You can't help but truly care about the outcome of this film even if it is a little predictable. I recommend this classic film if family movies are your thing.".

	schema:reviewBody "plot synopsis in this reviewOnce upon a time before there were Barefoot Executives Computers Wearing Tennis Shoes Strongest Men In The World World's Greatest Athletes  and Invisible College Students there was a studio named Disney that believed in making good  live action family motion pictures.  They made gems like 20000 Leagues Under The Sea Old Yeller Pollyanna Mary Poppins and this little gem called The Parent Trap.Not only do we get Hayley Mills playing dual roles with perfection we get a great script by David Swift who also wrote the script for Pollyanna and directed both films that draws us in right from the opening credits despite a somewhat obnoxious theme song vocalized by Tommy Sands and Annette Funicello.  Add to this one of the best supporting casts Walt could possibly have assembled and you have two hours plus of rollicking entertainment.When Hayley is on the screen with herself the effect is uncanny and you almost believe there are two Haley Mills.  These scenes are mixed with others where she interacts with a double the uncredited Susan Henning and the combination works  due in large part to Ub Iwerks who came up with the special photgraphic effects to make it all possible.  Remember in 1961 there was no such thing as digital effects so this was a tremendous undertaking for it's time not having been done to this extent before.You should know the story by now but briefly it centers around two girls Sharon and Susan who end up in the same summer camp and discover that they are identical twins who were separated from each other when their parents divorced each parent taking custody of one of the twin girls.  The rest of the movie centers on them changing identities not only to meet the other parent but in a wild scheme to get the parents played by Maureen O'Hara and Brian Keith back together again.  Okay so it is all farfetched but it is farfetched hilarity.Besides Hayley's performance Brian Keith and Maureen O'Hara are great also with Brian Keith never being funnier as the father who always seems to be getting the worst part of everything.  Add to this a possible future stepmonster played by Joanna Barnes and Leo G. Carroll in a small but unforgettable role as a preacher how could you go wrong?  Even if you don't like this type of film it's worth a look to see it at least once in your life.This movie was remade in 1998 with Lindsay Lohan Dennis Quaid and Natassia Richardson.  The update is equally fun which just goes to show what a good idea they had in the first place.If I have a complaint it's not with the movie but with the Disney Studios. This is one of their films that was given first class treatment on DVD one of the best I have purchased.  What makes this so maddening is that they can release a great DVD like this one minute then rush out bad DVD transfers on fine films like Moonspinners and The Journey of Natty Gann.  I'm not asking that they release every film in a special two disc edition but there is absolutely no excuse why they can't at least make a decent video transfer of some of their other films.  Just getting a decent copy of the films would be enough.  It's frustrating.Till Next Time Next Class Please".

We are left to ourselves to connect the dots from one bit of graffiti on various walls in the film to the next. Thus the current budget crisis the war in Iraq Islamic extremism the fate of social security 47 million Americans without health care stagnating wages and the death of the middle class are all subsumed by the sheer terror of graffiti.A truly stunningly idiotic film.".

He's like a stupid man's Michael Beywith all the awfulness that accolade promises.There's no point to the conspiracy no burning issues that urge the conspirators on. We are left to ourselves to connect the dots from one bit of graffiti on various walls in the film to the next. Thus the current budget crisis the war in Iraq Islamic extremism the fate of social security 47 million Americans without health care stagnating wages and the death of the middle class are all subsumed by the sheer terror of graffiti.A truly stunningly idiotic film.";

Most of the film is Bishop escaping from the killer and trying to uncover the truth.  The conspiracy is pretty thin and you can guess who is involved from the first 20 minutes.  The way that Bishop manages to uncover this great conspiracy is far too easy and it makes it all feel too lazy.  And the assassination attempt is worth seeing just to laugh at how ridiculous it is  I won't spoilt it for you but trust me it's totally absurd.  That leaves the chase element which is quite dull and gets repetitive.Sheen is not great here  often he can do well in poor films such as Terminal Velocity by giving a fun performance.  Here he is serious and hunted and must do serious throughout.  In fact the cast is actually really good on paper  lots of famous faces Linda Hamilton Sutherland Turturro Paul Gleason Sam Waterston and Gore Vidal.  Gore Vidal for God's sake!  How all these people manage to not see that this was going to be a turkey is beyond me.  Hamilton is unbelievable and seems content with the fact that it's not just a TVM.  Sutherland does his usual stuff and is quite good.  But should a poor film like this deserve a cast this deep?Overall a poor film that relies on lazy plotting to move it's action along. The conspiracy is easily uncovered and the killer is easily avoided.  When even Charlie Sheen describes this as a piece of s then you know it's not going to be good.

But all these people running around so deathly serious never seem to stop and realize hey this is really stupid what we're doing!A lot of the problems relate to the central assassinhit man a mute ironeyed killing machine who runs around in a tan duster that makes him stand out like a sore thumb.  He draws the line at shooting a defenseless puppy but otherwise he kills everything that moves and is such a bad guy that he LITTERS!It's easy to compare this movie to better efforts like In the Line of Fire or even the remake of The Jackal.  All feature a ruthless assassin constructing a secret weapon.  In the Line of Fire had a plausible and realistic one The Jackal was overkill but this one is ridiculous.  You have to see what the killer actually does at the end of the movie it blows what little seriousness the movie had and turns it into a farce.If you miss seeing this movie don't worry about it.".

Yet the D.C. police and the government still think they're the bad guys. Get real.And finally the assassin has been spending the entire movie creating some unknown but diabolical device for some reason. We finally discover he's gonna assassinate the president. How?

It has two lethal machine guns that are killing just about everybody in the convention center but the prez.Though lethal the powerful bullets have no kickback at all and the toy helicopter maintains its steady deadly but inaccurate course.The day is saved when Charlie releases a net of toy red white and blue balloons intended for the gala big finish and the deadly helicopter crashes.There are some great actors in this flick.

Considering the boxoffice response to it SHADOW CONSPIRACY is not all quite as bad as critics and the public reacted to it but still ain't very good to begin with and everything from script to direction is pretty predictable. Charlie Sheen plays the presidential assistant who finds himself caught up with assassins and chases a lot of them when he discovers a deadly conspiracy which lurks amongst the White House staff. After a professor is murdered Sheen aids the help of exflame reporter Amanda Givens Linda Hamilton to uncover the traitor and unlock the conspiracy of the title. But this script written by Adi Hasak  Ric Gibbs are pedestrian as they come not much differing from other White House conspiracy thrillers as in ABSOLUTE POWER and MURDER AT 1600. Some considerable talents Donald Sutherland Ben Gazzara and Stephen Lang try their best on a routine script but rarely saves it from predictability of the script. Not to mention a ludicrous scene which involves a toy helicopter which seems far too silly and outofplace in this serious political thriller. THE SHADOW CONSPIRACY has its moments I'm sure some of which are much to underappreciated director George Pan Cosmatos serves up some decent chase scenes but none of which lifts this routine thriller of which there's not much payoff or surprises.

Who can forget Sheen as the callow naif in Wall Street or Sutherland as the the cynical Korean War surgeon in MASH?

Has anyone remotely associated with this film ever lived a day in Washington?  Sheen is about 20 years too young way way too young to be so senior in a White House Administration.  Sheen's response to avert a political crisis is so ladened with false machismo he looks as though he attended the David Hasselhoff school of acting.  And when was the last time gang wars spread to Georgetown?  We're talking about a section of Washington where citizens voted against having a Metro stop so that they could maintain their exclusivity.I agree with another reviewer that this film would have been unbearable without the fast forward button.  I taped it off HBO a year ago and then took 3 separate viewings to plod through it.In summary  Don't buy this film.  Don't even rent this film.  If you see it at Blockbuster run away as fast as you can.".

Then he escapes another and another and another... in fact Mr. Sheen may suffer more Perils than Pauline. Shadow Conspiracy involves a plot to assassinate the President of the United States which Sheen tries to stop. They do get to that eventually. The story plays like they either didn't adhere to the script or revised it as they went along  this results in something which varies from confusing to predictable...For his last film director George P.

Serious and jutjawed Sheen disappoints by acting throughout  he's better when allowing himself into his characters with humor. Sheen doesn't appeal as a steelyeyed action hero. An illustrious supporting cast features reliable Donald Sutherland as Jacob Conrad who is fine but obvious in these surroundings and investigative reporter Linda Hamilton as Amanda Givens appearing confused and superfluous...At one point we're not to worry because there is a Shadow Government inside the White House. Since this is a Presidential assassination thriller it wouldn't be farfetched to assume Republican politician and former Vice President Dick Cheney saw this film. In politics beginning with the Richard M. Nixon Administration Mr. Cheney revealed a secret Shadow Government existed in the US shortly after the 911 World Trade Center terrorist attacks. The story seemed to die after a few days and Cheney is no longer asked about his mysterious revelation. Cheney was certain Iraq had weapons of mass destruction poised to attack the USA said the war would be over in weeks and other nonsense  so he may have swiped his Shadow Government idea from this relatively obscure movie.

There isn't much action to speak of aside from a couple of memorable chase sequences involving Sheen. It's derivative in the extreme. Nothing stands out about what so ever and it's been done much better. We aren't given any proper explanation as to why somebody on the inside working for the Whitehouse is causing all this trouble. It thinks it can just throw in twists whenever it wants and we will accept it. The swerves are very predictable as well. Charlie Sheen gives one of his worst performances here. Usually he has a lot of charisma and can make anything watchable. He takes everything serious and plays it completely straight. This movie could have benefited from Sheen's charisma but he plays it way too seriously. Linda Hamilton is entirely unconvincing and rather dull. This is the same woman who played Sarah Connor. The damsel in distress role is clearly not in her forte so why they cast her in this is beyond me. Linda Hamilton herself said this movie was horrible so that should tell you all there is to know. Donald Sutherland adds solid presence but his character has a predictable twist and he's kind of slumming it a bit. Ben Gazzara is wasted in his role whilst Stephen Lang makes for an OK baddie. I saw this last night and I don't remember much about it. That should tell you how effective this movie wasFinal Thoughts Avoid temptation and leave this one be.

	schema:reviewBody "El Crimen' was not a bad film although it was hardly worthy of accolades. While the acting was passable the story did not move along in a provocative enough manner to thoroughly captivate its audience in simple terms the movie was somewhat slow.What is interesting to notice is the reaction that the public especially the Catholic public has had to this film. As a Catholic it saddens me to see the amazing amount of rage focused around the lust of the film's central character Padre Amaro. The film on a superficial level was rebellion against stale relics of Catholic tradition such as requisite chastity for clergy and the deification of inanimate objects that may well spell the end of the faith if they are not shed. It is on these superficial levels that Padre Amaro is decried as a criminal of the faith by the viewing public but lust is not this priest's true crime.Central to the film's controversy is the corruption that propels the church. The truest crime of the film is the web of coverups and lies that the church creates in order to propagate its cause. The church is held deep in the pockets of the drug cartel and in order to maintain their stability the majority of the church leadership from the bishop down to the sacristansare quite comfortable with at worst lying and falsifying evidence or at best looking the other way. The crime of Padre Amaro is not so much that he acted upon his human impulses as that he accepts the corruption of the church by participating in its lies and creating lies of his own.Unfortunately this film's only expos is not the corruption of the church which has become more and more evident in recent times but the faithful church body's willingness to pretend that none of this goes on. One of the most terrifyingly ironic cries of foul against this film as evidenced in many of these reviews is Priests would never act that way!' How can one in today's climate make such assertions? While this film should in an ideal world be objectionable the current outcry by supposedly devout Catholics represents a denial of epidemic proportions.If one would set aside one's group think for two hours while watching this film one might gain a perspective of the church that our priests do not offer in their Sunday morning Masses. This film may not represent what we would like our church to be but it does represent what our church is. If we continue to pretend that the current state of affairs of our faith is acceptable then el crimen de Padre Amaro will also be our crime complacence.".

	schema:reviewBody "Based on an 1875 Portuguese novel by Eca de Quieros The Crime of Father Amaro the new film from director Carlos Carrera has been updated to modern Mexico. As it opens Father Amaro Gael Garca Bernal comes to Las Reyes for his first assignment. He starts out as an idealist showing kindness to a fellow bus passenger whose money is stolen during a holdup but when he arrives at the parish he quickly caves in to the established order.Father Benito Sancho Gracia is his superior and his main project is the building of a hospital orphanage and rest home. It is soon learned that Benito is having an affair with a local caf proprietor Sanjuanera Anglica Aragn and has taken money from the area's major drug lord to finance the hospital. Benito is also a vocal opponent of the good priest Father Natalio Daman Alczar whose support of the peasants and their guerilla revolution stirs resentment from the church hierarchy.When a reporter for the local paper is given photographs of Father Benito at a baptism with the drug kingpin he writes an article alleging that the hospital is a front for laundering drug money. The bishop urges Father Amaro to write a rebuttal i.e. a coverup in the paper saying that the funds came only from the church. Amaro then has an affair with the reporter's exgirlfriend Sanjuanera's young daughter Amelia Ana Claudia Talancn and in an awkward scene the priest drapes her in a blue robe that has been designed for the local church's statue of the Virgin Mary. You're more beautiful than the blessed virgin he tells her. The result of this liaison is a scandal that rocks the church. The Catholic Church has called for a boycott of The Crime of Father Amaro on religious grounds. Personally I'm more concerned with its artistic transgressions. The film provides little insight into the conflicting pressures that priests face in today's world and the characters are shallow and uninteresting. Given recent headlines about sexual abuse this issue could have been the focus for an important film but Carrera hits us over the head with his message so often that the film ends up as manipulative melodrama light years away from the subtle ironic thrusts of a Buuelian sword.".

Padre Amaro Gael Garcia Bernal is a young ambitious priest sent to a small town to work in his first church. Though he has a genuine passion to serve the spiritual needs of the people in his community he soon discovers that the other priests are immersed in scandal from breaking celibacy to hiding guerrillas to laundering money from powerful drug lords to controlling the media. It isn't long before he becomes entangled in his own scandal a love affair with a devout young woman played by Ana Claudia Talancn caught up in her own struggle between religious obedience and the temptations of the flesh.This film does an excellent job of capturing the complexity of human emotion. Much of the action takes place within the characters which is conveyed through excellent acting and careful attention to detail on the part of the director and cameramen. One of the things the director mentioned in the DVD's director commentary was how he tried to capture the glances of actors along with their facial expressions. Facial expressions were especially informative during the many closeup shots. This created a very intimate and emotional tone.Bernal delivers a compelling performance of deep internal struggle  private complex and emotional  between ambition and love loyalty to the Church and uneasiness with corruption and how to deal with a variety moral dilemmas. Is laundering money okay if you use it for a good cause? Is guerrilla warfare justified if you are fighting a criminal oppressor? How do you reconcile between duty to the corrupt church and devotion to its teachings? When is abortion justified? Ultimately the real crime of Father Amaro is not the obvious breaking of his celibacy. His crime is his loyalty to a corrupt church rather than his own values continuously running away and hiding from his situation instead of dealing with it and letting his ambition get in the way of everything else that mattered to him.".

	schema:headline " Catholic Church Corruption in Mexico";
	schema:reviewBody "Crimen del Padre AmaroThe film Crimen del Padre Amaro is set in Los Reyes Mexico in 2002. In Mexico by 2002 a continuing economic political and social crisis was spiraling deeper and deeper. The chaos was caused by a debt problem and the system of dependent capitalism the debt produced. Between 1994 and 2000 average wages declined 21 percent Keen 317. By 2002 Mexico had become more and more dependent primarily upon the United States its foreign export and its investmentcapital markets. Despite these setbacks Mexicans always had something to fall back upon and to look to for support the Catholic Church.The Catholic Church is the main focus in the movie Crimen del Padre Amaro. There are no specific events that occurred within the movie that occurred in real Mexican history however the events that do occur are believable and likely happened. Within the film Padre Benito is taking money donations from a local drug lord to help fund a new hospital. Since there are many drug lords in Mexico it is not unbelievable that two of the most powerful groups in Mexico are the drug lords and the Church officials. It makes sense that they would overlap at some point however I am sure that this scenario does not occur in all areas of Mexico. The director could have made it a little clearer that the drug lord was an actual drug lord it was a little confusing with the mayor and the drug lord to keep each person separate. Another point of corruption within the Church is the fact that both Padre Benito and Padre Amaro have sexual relations with females despite their celibacy vows. This is not surprising at all since it has become public knowledge that many Catholic priests have had sexual relations with people in recent years. The director could have shown more of the economic crisis and guerrilla warfare situations more because they were a little confusing if one did not know or look into what was going on in Mexico in 2002.The film is well made and attentiongrabbing. The plot is a little confusing at first as most movies are however it all becomes much clearer and focused as the movie continues. In the beginning of the movie Padre Amaro is seen as the good guy who everyone wanted to succeed however by the end of the film I looked upon Padre Amaro with complete disgust. Ironically Padre Benito I felt was a horrible corrupt priest in the beginning and by the end I liked him much more than ever before. Padre Amaro was so young and yet he ended up being the most selfish and corrupt of all the priests in the community. Crimen del Padre Amaro is a very interesting film that is entertaining and worth watching to see what modernday rural Mexico is like.The film Crimen del Padre Amaro shows an interesting outlook of the Catholic Church and the corruption that exists within the Church in Mexico. It is very gripping and definitely worth watching. Although there are parts that can be confusing it is fascinating to see how rural and backward parts of Mexican life can be. I would recommend viewing this movie and on a scale of 110 I would give it a 7.Works Cited Keen Benjamin and Keith Haynes A History of Latin America. New York Houghton Mifflin Company 2004.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 2002 in a small town in Mexico Father Amaro Gael Garcia Bernal a young and promising priest is assigned for that parochial. He is going to substitute Father Benito Diaz Sancho Gracia an old and corrupt priest of that community. Father Amaro is the protg of the Bishop Ernesto Gmez Cruz. Father Amaro meets Amelita the gorgeous and sexy actress Ana Claudia Talancn the very devoted catholic girlfriend of Rubn Andrs Montiel an atheist young journalist. Father Amaro also meets other priests of the neighbor towns in their periodical meeting in the church. In an environment of corruption and hypocrisy Amelita and Father Amaro fall in love to each other. This relationship full of lust and sin leads them to a tragic and hypocrite end. Yesterday I watched this movie which it is in my opinion one of the best or maybe the best I have watched in 2003. I agree that the story is controversial and probably some or most of Catholics will not like it. It touches many wounds in this religion. The classic story of Ea de Queiroz written in 1871 is greatly adapted for the present days. I have never had the chance of visiting Mexico but in Brazil in the TwentyFirst Century we have many country towns like the one showed in this wonderful film. The celibate was created in the Middle Ages by the Catholic Church to increase their wealth. How a normal man can keep the celibate is something that has never been clear for me. Lust desire is normal in a young man like the character of Father Amaro. In this movie we have a young priest having a sinful relation with a very sensual girl. An older priest has a hypocrite relationship with an old widow the mother of Amelita. This movie is indeed a great adaptation of a beautiful romance with great performances and direction. My vote is ten.Title Brazil O Crime do Padre Amaro The Crime of Father Amaro".

	schema:reviewBody "The release of the film THE CRIME OF PADRE AMARO caused about as much of an uproar in Mexico in 2002 as the publication of the novel written by Jose Maria Eca de Queiroz caused in 1875. With its dangerously intertwining themes of spiritual ecstasy and sexual passion it's not hard to see why. At the heart of the story is a young priest who wrestles in a major way with the tempting hungers of his body and the gracefilled yearnings of his spirit. It does not help that to pursue his vocation he is sent to a town sustained by a culture of corruption.One thing actor Gael Garcia Bernal does not know how to do is give a bad performance and in the movie's title role he captures brilliantly all the agonizing ambiguity that comes with being a young adult male intent on asserting his masculinity while also serving the spiritual needs of his community. Unfortunately his happily deluded demeanor meets with an equally intense personality in the form of Amelia a devout young devotee acted with mesmerizing perfection by the gorgeous Ana Claudia Talancon. Amelia idolizes the young priest as a true and noble holy man whose sexuality is made sacred by his presumably pure soul. He in turn dares to drape her in a cape reserved for representations of the Madonna and recites to her from Solomon's Song of Songs as they seduce each other. Controversial? Better believe it.As in the film THE HEALER please see companion review The Crime of Padre Amaro depicts sexuality and spirituality as equally powerful forces of attraction capable of producing very different results which will not be revealed here. The outcome in The Crime of Padre Amaro is shocking in more ways than one and well worth contemplating for a long time.by AuthorPoet Aberjhani author of Christmas When Music Almost Killed the World".

	schema:reviewBody "Possible Spoilers included!The story revolves around a twentyfour year priest Father Amaro Gael Garca Bernal who fresh out of seminary arrives at the town of Los Reyes Mexico as the assistant to Father Benito Sancho Gracia.  It seems at first to be a film like Mass Appeal 1984 based on the Broadway play of the same name that will explore the relationship between an experienced jaded priest and an idealistic nave one Amaro discovers that Benito is having an affair with his housekeeper and is laundering money for the local drug lord to build a modern regional hospital.  A liberationist priest Father Natalio Prez Damin Alczar provides a foil for such established church pragmatism.  His devoted work on behalf of the poor and perhaps in aide of the guerrillas provokes the ire of the church hierarchy.  Amaro admires Prez for his willingness to choose his ministry over his ecclesial career even though he won't make the same sacrifice himself.  When Amaro meets the beautiful but notyetoflegalage catechist Amelia Ana Claudia Talancn and they fall into illicit passion the film then focuses on the sexual sins of the youth and the inevitable tragic consequences. The Crime of Padre Amaro' is his willingness to sacrifice Amelia and the baby to his budding church career. From its promising beginnings the film devolves into a formulaic critique of the church and its hypocrisy.  While the subject of its critique caused a storm of controversy in Mexico I find its obvious and heavyhanded treatment more problematic.  Rather than fulfilling its initial premise of exploring the bewildering pressures that face a new priestcelibacy vs. loneliness pastoral calling vs. compromise with dominant culture serving the people vs. serving one's career in the churchthe story instead finally relies on its ability to titillate and shock.  The film loves to play with traditional religious images like the statues of Jesus and Mary that are central to Mexican popular Roman Catholicism.  Sometimes the visual skewering of traditional religious sensibilities works well in the film as when children are seen snacking on stolen hosts spread with cajeta' caramelized sugar and milk or when the local traditional healer in the parish takes a piece of the consecrated host back to her home to heal her ailing cat or later forces the host down the throat of a girl with severe disabilities thinking it will exorcise the demons.  Interestingly in the DVD audio commentary on the DVD release the director notes that there was strong protest voiced against the gentle feeding of the host to the sick cat but not the beating and forced feeding of the woman.  At other times it just seems clumsy as when the disabled woman Gethsemani' rips up a book of religious pictures while the two lovers breathe heavily in the adjoining room or when Amaro drapes Amelia in a robe meant for a statue of the Virgin.  And must every touch between Amaro and Amelia be followed by a cut to a picture of Jesus praying or looking down on them with disappointment as he bleeds on the cross? At its best this is a morally complex film with no clear heroes many victims and a lot of unlikable characters.  For all its focus on the church it isn't a particularly theological film.  Genuine questions about faith are hidden behind the sensational sins of the clergy.  But viewers who are not predisposed as sometimes the film seems to loathe the church may find enough here to seriously discuss its many faults even in the absence of a more balanced view.".

I ended up staying up and watching the whole thing. At first the movie was a little slow moving and didn't really hold all of my attention but then I really started to become more and more fascinated by the conflicts that were arising in this young priest's life. When he began the affair with the young girl did he do it out of spite or out of a true love for this girl? I still don't know because when i saw the ending i was a little shocked and couldn't believe the movie was ending with him serving her funeral.Other than that i found the movie to be well made and i loved the lead the one who played in y tu mama tambien another great movie. He conveyed very well all of the inner conflicts that his character was going through.Now i was born and raised catholic and i cant say that i have no problem with the church because i do have several problems and i know this movie caused quite a controversy and i can see why. The fact that this movie was bringing all of the corruption of the catholic church to light may have made certain parties a little miffed. But corruption occurs in all religions and just because your catholic doesn't mean you shouldn't see this movie because it is a well made movie and one that doesn't look lightly upon the corruption. This movie shows that corruption in any form has the power to destroy and ultimately will destroy.".

Another good surprise is Ana Claudia Talancn not only for her astonishing beauty but also for a great performance as Amelia. The cast is very good and the plot yet polemical gives a lot to think. Again by updating the old Portuguese story to a contemporary Mexico and inserting current issues like the relation between church and drug dealers El Crimen del Padre Amaro raises some relevant questions about celibate religious ethics and hypocrisy.

	schema:reviewBody "Carlos Carrera made the controversial film El crimen del Padre Amaro to expose the corruption and hypocrisy of the Roman Catholic Church in Mexico. He wants his target audience of Latin Americans to understand that priests are merely human. Carrera casts the handsome Gael Garcia Bernal as Padre Amaro. The people in the film as well as the audience are drawn by his looks and inadvertently view him as a good person. In the beginning the director portrays Amaro as selfless through the shot of him giving money to the man on the bus. Carrera reveals that Amaro's life is about to change as he zooms in on the wheels driving over the rocky muddy road. Shortly after arriving in Los Reyes the corruption begins to infiltrate Amaro's character. Following in the bishop's unscrupulous footsteps Amaro threatens the newspaper into printing the church's story and he gets the journalist fired for printing the truth about the church accepting laundered drug money. Amaro becomes desensitized through the sins he witnesses. He sees Padre Benito violating his celibacy with Sanjuanera and ironically he violates his own celibacy with her daughter Amelia. In an attempt to cover his own sins he is responsible for destroying Amelia's life. The final scene is amazing. Carrera films Padre Amaro at the pulpit during Amelia's funeral service and then he slowly retracts the camera down the long aisle. The camerawork is smooth and pans the whole congregation from behind. The angle and technique renders a sense of continuous corruption of one lie after another.An interesting aspect that Carrera brought into this melodrama was a sense of authenticity through the use of nonactors as townspeople. Another noteworthy feature is that he uses very little music in this film. Instead he uses sounds that are more organic which enables the audience to sense God.".

	schema:reviewBody "How quickly the events in the news can inure us to the ugly realities of life.  In the wake of all those priest sex scandals that have come to light in recent times El Crimen Del Padre Amaro' comes across as more timely yet less shocking to us today than it would have had it been released a few years back.  This Oscarnominated film from Mexico written by Vincent Lenero and directed by Carlos Carrera features priests who fornicate priests who launder drug money priests who arm guerrillas priests who pay for abortions priests in short who seem to do everything imaginable except what they were originally ordained to do.  Not only is the Church hierarchy in this film in bed with drug runners as well as half the female members of the parish apparently but it even dictates to the local newspaper what it will report about the Church and where on the front page such stories will go.It's safe to say that many devout Catholics will see this film as yet another antipapist screed designed to further degrade the image of the world's most powerful religious organization.  But the makers of El Crimen Del Padre Amaro' seem less concerned with attacking the Church than with examining the human frailties that motivate the characters' actions. Part of their argument seems to be that the complexities of life and of human nature make it virtually impossible for anyone of flesh and blood to remain saintly for very long.  This is particularly true in a setting like rural Mexico where the daytoday struggle for survival overwhelms all other concerns  spiritual as well as temporal.  Father Benito is the leader of the parish who rationalizes his dealings with the local drug dealers by arguing that bad money becomes good money' when it is used in the service of the Lord.  How else is he going to get the funds necessary to build the new hospital for his people?  Father Natalio an espouser of liberation theology' finds himself at loggerheads with Father Benito actually arming the very guerillas who fight against those same drug lords.   Natalio suffers no qualms about having men killed if that is what is necessary to achieve his goals for his people.   Finally Father Amaro the focal point of the film has his own demons to confront.  Barely out of seminary this idealistic young man played by Gael Garcia Bernal one of the leads of Y Tu Mama Tambien' arrives in town determined to make his mark as a priest who does good for his parishioners.  What he doesn't bank on is the corrosive effect of the corrupt system into which he is sent or his own susceptibility to the weaknesses of the flesh.  Being young and handsome Father Amaro soon finds himself the target of an amorous young woman who confuses pious sentiment with plain and simple erotic desire.What makes Father Amaro interesting is that he is never as righteous as we think he should be in the beginning and never as unredeemably corrupt as we think he should be at the end.  In many ways he is just like anyone else who looks for the easiest way out for himself when the going gets tough. Many viewers may want Amaro to assume the role of conventional hero stepping in to right the wrongs taking place in this village.  Yet he will not accept that role.  What makes the story tragic is not that Amaro is a man of potential greatness brought down by his own weaknesses or the machinations of others but the fact that he is basically just an ordinary kid trying hard to be extraordinary' choosing the priesthood as his way of achieving it yet lacking the intestinal fortitude and strength of character men must have if they hope to be great.   That Amaro slips so easily into the amoral role set up for him by the likes of Father Benito even though the old priest seems to find some redemption at the end is what gives the film its air of frustrating hopelessness.   Who we are led to ask will finally put an end to this vicious cycle?  We know it will not be Amaro.In many ways the filmmakers may be trying to do too much in this film. Each of the stories involving the three priests could make an interesting movie in its own right.  As it is we sometimes get the sense that the film in trying to create a fullblown tapestry of Catholicism in Mexico ends up giving short shrift to some of the more fascinating elements of the story. So much time is spent on the sexual dalliances of Father Amaro and the girl Amelia that we don't really get to see enough of the other forms of controversy and corruption with which the film is dealing.  The Liberation Theology movement in particular is dealt with in rather too sketchy a fashion leaving us generally puzzled and unenlightened on that topic.The actors do a superb job bringing their characters to life.  In addition to the aforementioned Bernal Sancho Gracia and Damian Alcazar are excellent as Amaro's fellow troubled priests and Ana Claudia Talancon is pretty and poised as the young girl drawn by lust love and passion to this weaksouled priest.Viewers will most likely find El Crimen Del Padre Amaro' to be either a brave film or an offensive one depending on which side of the religious divide they happen to come down on.  But after the recent stories in the news very few of us should really be shocked by what we see here on the screen.".

El crimen del padre Amaro called The Crime of Father Amaro in English portrays newly ordained priest Amaro Gael Garcia Bernal getting pulled in several directions in a small Mexican town. The most prominent is a simmering desire to have sex with the dazzling Amelia Ana Claudia Talancon. Finally it all comes crashing down...irrevocably.The Catholic Church was of course disturbed by this movie but any religious group is likely to get unnerved by any movie that takes a gutwrenching look at their religion. I certainly thought that the movie does a good job looking at guilt and other such things. But mind you this is not a movie for the squeamish.".

El crimen del padre Amaro called The Crime of Father Amaro in English portrays newly ordained priest Amaro Gael Garcia Bernal getting pulled in several directions in a small Mexican town. The most prominent is a simmering desire to have sex with the dazzling Amelia Ana Claudia Talancon. Finally it all comes crashing down...irrevocably.The Catholic Church was of course disturbed by this movie but any religious group is likely to get unnerved by any movie that takes a gutwrenching look at their religion. I certainly thought that the movie does a good job looking at guilt and other such things. But mind you this is not a movie for the squeamish.";

	schema:reviewBody "WARNING SPOILERSEL CRIMEN DEL PADRE AMARO is a film whose impact in Mexico a norteamericano like me can only imagine  even though when I saw it in Berkeley a lot of the audience members were Latino. This is a powerful picture of the Catholic church with a corrupt bishop who's little different from a drug lord a parish priest who's been having an affair with an older woman and laundering the narcos' money to build a hospital a young muckraking reporter who gets railroaded out of town and at the center of it all a young priest who deflowers an innocent young overreligious virgin girl and prods her to get an abortion that leads to her death  and gets away with it.  And they all do.  They all get away with it.EL CRIMEN DEL PADRE AMARO seems superficially conventional and ordinary but in fact it's not so conventional or ordinary as all that. True it's simple and schematic beginning with big closeups of the faces of the principals neatly outlined scenes music nice music though  that comes in loudly at key points. The elements of the story are laid out bluntly enough there's something generic about the cynical mayor the saintly country priest who helps the campesinos fight the narcos and the state police and gets accused of supporting guerrillas and finally excommunicated for not towing the line the fourth priest who's a fat man whose whole joy is eating and drinking. The plot is boldly developed.  Nothing is ambiguous.But to begin with it's really all much too well done to call conventional and it stars the biggest young actor in Mexico the 24yearold Gael Garca Bernal who has just appeared in the two most powerful and brilliant Mexican movies of recent years AMORES PERROS 2000 and Y TU MAM TAMBIN 2001. Bernal's presence alone commands a degree of attention for the movie that is not ordinary or conventional.The plot of EL CRIMEN DEL PADRE AMARO recalls somewhat the classic polarities of the Italian Giovanni Guareschi's 1950's Don Camillo' books celebrated in a Fernandel film and four sequels 195165  the parish priest the communist mayor the pious old ladies the plotters and busybodies the everyday people subject to life's common temptations greed love and lust.  But this story though based on a 19th century Portuguese novel by Ea de Queirs has been transformed by Mexican director Carlos Carrera himself like Bernal a meteoric young talent in Mexico into a more serious and hard edged depiction of the very latest Latin American issues  narcos and municipios preying on campesinos widespread ecclesiastical and secular corruption media repression.  Guareschi's peccadillos have been upgraded to fullfledged mortal sins and civil and personal disasters  ruined lives blackmail wrongful deaths murders and assassinations.Bernal who plays Padre Amaro the newly anointed priest whose arrival in town starts the action was notable in Y TU MAM TAMBIN and AMORES PERROS for a charming smile and an infectious giggle that could instantly turn into overthetop hilarity.  The source of his strong screen presence seemed to be the way he radiated a sense of wild goodnatured fun and he and his reallife friend Diego Luna played off each other magically in Y TU MAM. This time there's no sidekick and no hilarity only a honeyed look of sweetness and a superficially cooperative manner that conceals a steel will an ability to maintain a deadpan mask of goodness while executing the pragmatic bishop's most draconian orders and simultaneously covering his own ass.  Though his flesh is weak when it comes to the young virgin he deflowers Padre Amaro's vocation' takes precedence over his love affair. He knows how to play the system.  We see that he'll go far.  He's an agile survivor who never hesitates  in this movie nobody does.  This is a story about how things work not about doubts.  Lots of wrongs get done and everybody gets away with it  except for the poor young girl.What is least conventional about this superficially conventional film is that there's no catharsis offered no emotional purgation no satisfying reward or punishment or twohandkerchief ending.  In the final scene Padre Amaro is leading a service in honor of the young woman whose death he has just caused.  He seems eloquent authoritative convincing. His angelic young face which reveals nothing of his true nature as he conducts the service comes to haunt you because there's really from start to finish nothing to like about him other than his soft looks and ingratiating manner. This padrecito' is a btard a cabrn an ahole.  EL CRIMEN is a movie with a totally unsympathetic protagonist one you can't identify with for a minute. No catharsis there  unless you're so cynical that to see hypocrisy triumph leaves you feeling satisfied.EL CRIMEN DEL PADRE AMARO creates the Alienation Effect' Verfremdungseffekt the great German playwright Bertolt Brecht specialized in  the quality of giving the audience nothing gratifying to identify with and thus forcing its members to think hard about the subject the play or in this case movie presents to us. Brecht's characters and plots are highly schematic and neatly outlined too like the plot of EL CRIMEN. We're forced to think more than anything not about the individuals the manipulated and Machiavellian young Padre Amaro his girlfriend the various schematically clearcut characters but above all about the hypocrisy of the Mexican government and the Catholic church and the evil system that prevails.  A kind of shock value is created when we see Dionisia feed stolen communion wafers to her cat and when Padre Amaro recites the Song of Songs as he deflowers his pious young girlfriend and dresses her naked body in the robe of the virgin. It's true there are a few moments of strong sympathy along the way the most powerful one being when Padre Amaro delivers the excommunication fax to the saintly campesino priest Padre Natalio.  Amaro knows Natalio is gold and he is dross and we weep for him but when Amaro stands high in the church celebrating with the broken Padre Benito in a wheelchair turning away from him we too turn away from him with a sense of distaste.Bernal lives up to expectations. Equally strong in their roles are Ana Claudia Talancn as Amelia Amaro's victim lover Sancho Gracia as the older parish priest Padre Benito Damian Alczar as the radiantly committed Padre Natalio and Luisa Huertas as the crazy and corrupt old fanatic Dionisia who leads Amaro to the abortion clinic and along the way provides some shrill comic relief.Sure this movie is conventional  and even lurid  in many ways and thereby well designed to draw in the general public in Mexico and everywhere else. IL CRIMEN DEL PADRE AMARO is a vivid depiction of the corruption of the Catholic clergy and the corruptibility victimization and confusion of the general Mexican populace.  It's enormously controversial and thought provoking coming from a Catholic country and there's no wonder it's been a huge box office hit in Mexico. It has bite and it's exceptionally well made. It would be foolish not to recognize it as one of the more notable movies of 2002.".

His father Nathan Ray Liotta has a new wife Mary Catherine McCormack and is usually away on business.  Nathan never talked to James about the tragedy so James has not yet finished grieving he resents Mary and will not accept her as a mother.  Maddy Bennett Vanessa Redgrave is an older but still vivacious neighbour who lost her son in the war.  She befriends James and helps him through the trauma. Redgrave's acting is superb and the message of the story is beautiful but the script and direction are very emotionally manipulative sinking into maudlin melodrama too often.  Those who just want a good story and can focus on the message and Redgrave's performance will love this film others may be put off by the excessive sentimentality.".

Maddy Bennett Vanessa Redgrave is an older but still vivacious neighbour who lost her son in the war.  She befriends James and helps him through the trauma. Redgrave's acting is superb and the message of the story is beautiful but the script and direction are very emotionally manipulative sinking into maudlin melodrama too often.  Those who just want a good story and can focus on the message and Redgrave's performance will love this film others may be put off by the excessive sentimentality.";

He does a great job and I had no difficulty accepting his character on the same level as hers.Yes it is a heartwarming story but it addresses death with honesty and some realworld strategies for getting past the grief of losing a loved one.

I'm not very religious and have become less since the death of a loved one. But it would be wonderful to believe that there are angels and that when it's my turn that I will eventually see my aunt who was my best friend again. This movie is entirely rewarding genuinely uplifting and in plain terms made me feel a lot less depressed. Vanessa Redgrave has never been one of my favorites I remember her from the sixties and she just ticked me off. But her acting in this is a real treat she looks fantastic for her age and I would kill for her hair. We could all use a Maddie Bennett in our lives. I actually own two of these so if one gets damaged I have one to fall back on. So buy or rent this movie if you haven't seen it. Better yet buy it  you're gonna want to watch it more than once!".

	schema:reviewBody "Youth and guilt can be a potent combination especially in the wake of a tragic accident when they come together to manifest responsibility where there is none imagined or real fault precipitates inordinate guilt that can weigh a person down.  And such a burden is hard for anyone to carry but can be especially devastating if the individual in question is young and blameless the very situation examined by director Peter O'Fallen in A Rumor of Angels' the heartfelt drama of a boy emotionally disabled by the memory of the car wreck that claimed the life of his mother and who now bears the guilt of survival amplified by the passing of time and selfincrimination.  It's a bitter pill better left in the bottle but without solace a task easier said than done.For some two years young James Neubauer Trevor Morgan has struggled with the loss of his mother and a contrary attitude born of selfreproach has created a seemingly unbridgeable chasm between him and his father Nathan Roy Liotta who is often away on business and the relationship he has with his stepmother Mary Catherine McCormack is tentative at best.  His real problem though lies in the fact that he is simply unable to express the feelings of darkness that have since the accident encroached upon his soul.  Of those around him he seems able to relate only to Nathan's younger brother his Uncle Charlie Ron Livingston it's something but not nearly enough.His life takes a turn however when circumstances bring him into contact with an eccentric old woman Maddy Bennett Vanessa Redgrave who lives alone in an old house by the sea.  Something from her past strikes a chord that produces a bond between them and Maddy's insights into life and loss soon begin to have an effect on James.  But Maddy has ways and ideas that to some are strange and conflict arises when Nathan gets wind of the relationship that has formed between his son and Maddy and when for better or worse he determines to see it stopped.As a storyteller O'Fallen has a nice touch he wastes no time in getting right to the heart of the drama moving it all along even as he is setting it up.  It's an effective approach in that it puts you in the story very quickly and allows for some reflective moments without retarding the pace or development of the characters or the story.  And the way he inserts flashes' of flashbacks to the accident throughout the film gives the viewer some real insight into what's going on in James' head.  It's not a revolutionary technique by any means but O'Fallen knows how to use it well and to great effect.  He provides the action with a sense of real time which makes the relationship between Maddy and James convincing as it develops and as this is the pivotal aspect of the film it makes it credible and believable.  This is a story of two unlikely people finding and making an impact on one another's lives and O'Fallen does a good job of avoiding the maudlin sentimentality to which such a story could be predisposed.  And he does it by tempering the sentiment with real emotion rather than resorting to melodrama to sell it which O'Fallen obviously realized would have been entirely ineffective.  Instead he takes the high albeit harder road and keeps it real which in turn takes the film to a higher level.  O'Fallen has a discerning eye and the capacity to understand human nature as well as the ability to translate it convincingly to the screen.Young Trevor Morgan came into this project with an impressive resume that includes such films as The Sixth Sense' The Patriot' Jurassic Park 3' and The Glass House' and he has obviously prospered artistically from his experience which he indicates with his work here.  Morgan's portrayal of this conflicted young man is mature and he resoundingly captures James' attitude and state of mind in terms that are real and convincing.  To make the film work Morgan has to convey emotions that due to his particular situation must transcend the typical complexities of youth and he succeeds in doing so.  He also develops his character honestly as evidenced by the manner in which his relationship with Maddy proceeds.  It's a solid performance with a quality that is natural and altogether affecting.The highlight of the film however is the performance turned in by Vanessa Redgrave as Maddy.  With this portrayal Redgrave creates a character that is the very affirmation of the joys of life as her Maddy fervently embraces it in all it's myriad aspects running the full gamut of emotions as she does so.  This is a role that allows Redgrave to break loose and give herself over totally to the character and she immerses herself in Maddy this unique individual to whom reality is but a canvas upon which she may impose her own version of it while keeping her own counsel and living as she will.  It's a vibrant performance touching and poignant and alive and arguably one of her best in a long long time.  This is work that is truly Redgrave' which attests to her endless capacity and talent as an actor including her ability to so profoundly touch her audience.Liotta McCormack and especially Livingston are effective in their respective roles as well offering strong support to Redgrave and Morgan who are clearly the stars of the show.  In retrospect though it's the strength of one performance that adds  to the strength of another transferring and sharing as it does a collective energy that insures the success of this film.  The supporting cast also includes George Coe Dr. Jenkins and Michelle Grace Lillian.  A film that will make you feel as well as think A Rumor of Angels' is satisfying entertainment that encourages you to take pause and take stock of the things that are truly important.  910.".

	onyx:emotionText "Youth and guilt can be a potent combination especially in the wake of a tragic accident when they come together to manifest responsibility where there is none imagined or real fault precipitates inordinate guilt that can weigh a person down.  And such a burden is hard for anyone to carry but can be especially devastating if the individual in question is young and blameless the very situation examined by director Peter O'Fallen in A Rumor of Angels' the heartfelt drama of a boy emotionally disabled by the memory of the car wreck that claimed the life of his mother and who now bears the guilt of survival amplified by the passing of time and selfincrimination.  It's a bitter pill better left in the bottle but without solace a task easier said than done.For some two years young James Neubauer Trevor Morgan has struggled with the loss of his mother and a contrary attitude born of selfreproach has created a seemingly unbridgeable chasm between him and his father Nathan Roy Liotta who is often away on business and the relationship he has with his stepmother Mary Catherine McCormack is tentative at best.

	schema:headline " Just a masterpiece like any Clouzot's work";
	schema:reviewBody "It appears that the outstanding director HenriGeorge Clouzot was unable to make movies short of being masterpieces. La Verite may be defined as the European Rashomon and well aware that my opinion will be considered a sacrilege I venture to say that Clouzot's film is even better than Kurosawa's celebrated masterpiece. In fact the essence of both Rashomon and La Verite lies in the quest of the truth of a story reconstructed through a sequence of flashbacks.La Verite narrates the trial of the breathtakinglybeautifulsexy lost girl Dominique Brigitte Bardot for the murder of her former boyfriend Gilbert Samy Frey. Everybody Dominique herself her former friends and various lovers her enemies notably her own sister as well as lawyers and prosecutors states his own version of the facts but what is the actual truth? To simplify the question is Dominique just a ruthless killer or was she a weak enamored girl victim of Gilbert's selfishness and bullying? As always in Clouzot's movies La Verite is extremely intense packed with a profound and uncompromising psychological study. The almost obsessive pace of events gives no break to both the characters and the audience. The script is firstrate with plenty of cynical sense of humor in spite of the dramatic facts told.Brigitte Bardot was a great actress endowed with an outstanding talent. A careful viewer could easily get it even from BB's performances in minor movies like say Mademoiselle Pigalle. Here under the sound direction of a genius like Clouzot she is just sensational in a highly dramatic role. Of course also the acting by the remainder of the cast is excellent especially needless to say by the legends Charles Vanel and Paul Meurisse as the two lawyers.Possibly the main credit of this fantastic movie lies in a gelid sarcastic misanthropic representation of human society. Arguably this is the trademark of Clouzot's style together with suspense which here is present but not exasperated like in his other works. The world of the adults is wholly despicable permeated as they are with hypocrisy with prejudice and fear especially in sexual matters and with sickening cynicism as masterly represented by the lawyer Paul Meurisse.However the youngsters are no better than the adults. They are just fatuous selfish conceited loafers only able to utter pseudointellectual chats. As a matter of fact when Dominique founds herself in dire straits none of her young friends moves a finger to help her. And Dominique often appears even worse than the others. From some point of view she might be considered a totally negative character.So what's the point of Clouzot? I think that's not an issue. He just shows what he sees that's the style and the aim of one of the greatest artists in the history of cinema.La Verite is a total masterpiece. It is impossible to be disappointed. Highly recommended.".

Surely the blonde siren wasn't everybody's first chance for a female lead in a HenriGeorges Clouzot film then again the role she is playing fits perfectly. Dominique Marceau is a pretty young girl eager to leave her parents home and live with her sister in Paris. Other than her Dominique is living out her lust for life hanging around with friends with parties drinking and casual affairs. By coincidence she encounters her sisters fiance a very serious young musician. Eventually they fall in love but Dominique can't be faithful and Gilbert Sami Freys character cannot adjust to her way of life. They break up reunite and break up again  with Gilbert more and more being ridiculed by her affairs with other men. On the other hand Dominique cannot let him go either and when he suddenly loses all his passion and returns to her sister Dominique makes a decision. This is all told in flashback sequences during the trial in which Dominique is accused of Gilberts murder. The people participated in finding the truth Clouzot tells us are incapable of leaving their personal convictions and moral perspectives out of the court. Whatever the verdict may be Dominique won't leave as an innocent.  La Verit has some memorable scenes not least the one where Gilbert is conducting Strawinskys Oiseau de Feu on television which blends over to the next scene while the music continues without a break. While being a serious drama about passion and justice Clouzots film still makes good use of Bardots erotic energy  and yet there is never a moment where the images make the story irrelevant.".

The film emphasises Bardot Dominique the character is effectively overshadowed by the star who plays her as sexual modern promiscious flighty idle a spendthrift all at odds with the uptight bourgeois ruling class. The film is a fascinating glimpse into the values that preoccupied the French bourgeoisie at the turn of the decade with its emphasis on the students of the Latin Quarter as a drop out counter culture compared to the good youth learning traditional music at the Conservatoire. Not so much a generation clash then more one group rooted in tradition versus another embracing modernity and new models of behaviour. The film is sometimes unwittingly hysterical as it has dated so much and it does not so much end as fizzle out but in its depiction of a youthful counter culture it anticipates the events of May 1968 nearly a decade before they occur. BB may have lost the particular battle in this film but she went on to win the war.".

	schema:headline " Nothing hurts like The Truth ...";
	schema:reviewBody "While the title might sound familiar to some hardcore fans there are chances that many potential lovers will never have the opportunity to find this masterful courtroom drama on TV or DVD.Indeed the truth is that HenriGeorge Clouzot's film of the same name has been sentenced to decades of cinematic oblivion 7 reviews on IMDb says enough. And the injustice is even more cruel because the movie stands alone as a masterpiece of the genre in a period full of gripping courtroom dramas such as 12 Angry Men Anatomy of a Murder Judgment at Nuremberg or Inherit the Wind where the verdict mattered less than the quest for truth it initiated and the statements it spoke about the impact of human perceptions in the exercise of justice.This is why the main question in The Truth is not 'who killed' not even 'how' but 'why?' the film takes place during the trial ensuing the murder of Gilbert Tellier Sami Frey as a talented handsome and ambitious conductor by his beautiful girlfriend Dominique Marceau who tried to kill herself right after. Dominique is played by a 25year old Brigitte Bardot in a breakthrough dramatic performance that elevated her status to the most promising actress of her generation rather than a onedimensional bimbo.Yet Bardot's sexappeal is still significant to the story as Clouzot intelligently exploits it to highlight the sulfurous past of a young idle girl who used her body as an asset to live without working without prostituting herself either. Indeed Dominique Marceau isn't the typical slut there is in her attitude something that nonchalantly confines to pathos embodying the unease of the 60's youth being in her own feminine and naughty way a sort of rebel without a cause. And the intent of Clouzot is less to make a social commentary but to explore the different facets of a seemingly obvious personality.The trial becomes the setting for a gripping character study revisiting the life of Dominique Marceau before the killing from the perspective of two different counselors played by two giants. Paul Meurisse denounces Dominique's laziness the jealousy she always felt toward her more studious sister Annie and a bunch of former lovers come to belie her faithfulness and love for Tellier whom she murdered by vengeance because she couldn't stand his relationship with Annie. As for her suicidal attempts there were calculated acts since she was always sure someone would come at time to save her.On the other side Dominique's lawyer played by Charles Vanel tends to demonstrate that the murder was a passioned crime an act of desperation from a tormented woman as Dominique truly loved Gilbert and couldn't imagine life without him. One of the film's greatest delights is the verbal duel between the two actors and their interactions that remind some of the great courtroom dramas when two respectable adults even friends become visceral enemies during the trial James Stewart and George C. Scott Spencer Tracy and Frederic March or more recently Tom Cruise and Kevin Bacon.The interest of the MeurisseVanel antagonism is to keep a shadow of mystery around Bardot's real personality a villainous killer or a woman victim of her passion. And as the story progresses Dominique's portrait originally painted in black and white reveals many shades of gray while her victim the goodhearted Tellier becomes less and less innocent. The story opens in Paris where Bardot embodies the youth's ennui living like a sort of social parasite whose only excuse is to use her body as thin consolation. Yet she can't be a slut because she's totally unaware of conventions she's beyond them and doesn't even feel guilty.Naturally the inevitable happens Tellier Annie's friend falls in love with the sensual provincial girl. It's the typical love at first sight but it's handled in a very talented way by Clouzot who's a real craftsman when it comes to human emotions. Hefirst meets Dominique when she's lying naked topless in her bed swinging her beautiful behind to some mambo music she incarnates the luscious fruit she's everything her sister is not that's what makes her so obsessively desirable. Then the romance between Marceau and Tellier turns into a series of passion deception treachery and arguments like only a director like Clouzot could have painted without falling in a sentimental or either Manichean trap.And as we get closer to the murder we understand the roots of Dominique's behavior and her suicidal attempts carry deepest significances rather than an act of despair they crystallize the vulnerability of a girl that tries to find her place in society torn between the true love of Gilbert and a sort of paradoxical innocence that raises above her lust. It feels strange but when you keep an eye on Bardot's performance you'd think twice before calling a girl a slut. Bardot was the perfect choice for the role and her breakdown transcends the sensual contours of her delicious body and can touch any soul.After watching the film I guess the reason of its lack of notoriety is the fact that HG Clouzot is renowned for several masterpieces of the thriller genre blending it with elements of horror mystery or police procedural therefore a movie like The Truth comes too late in his filmography and doesn't meet the same recognition than the acclaimed The Crow Quai des Orfvres not to mention the classic Wages of Fear andDiaboliques. But on its own it's a magnificent exploration of the human soul a masterfully written courtroom drama and still a Clouzot's film with its dark and pessimistic undertones and the eternal cloud of ambiguity that envelops the character's personalities.Bardot lived a romance with Frey after the film and she was so affected by the experience that like her character she tries to commit suicide if a film haunted its own actors it gives you an idea about the psychological impact it might have on you".

	schema:headline " Bardot and Clouzot  a milestone movie";
	schema:reviewBody "In Bernard Tavernier's film 'Laissez Passer' HenriGeorges Clouzot gets indirectly a harsh treatment. He is one of these directors who continued to work under the German occupation during WWII and was attacked for this attitude long time after. He was also a fine director classics like 'Quai d'Orfevres' and 'Diabolique' are among the best works in French cinema until the emergence of the New Wave which displaced Clouzot.It is ironical that 'La Verite' was his last great film and that the New Wave exponents were so critical of him. The film contains in my opinion in it many of the elements that were further taken over continued and amplified by Truffaut Godard et co. It is to some extent a milestone at the border between the classic and the new French cinema of the 60s. The subject itself speaks about the confrontation of two generations. A young girl is brought to trial. She killed her lover and the court needs to decide if this was an accident or a passion crime or a calculated murder. The tribunal is composed of all that represents the old generation  judges lawyers audience  all ready to pass a moral judgment or maybe a lynch on the girl. She comes from a different world she belongs to a different generation one that refuses to complain to conventions she speaks a different language listens to a different music feels and loves differently. Today's spectator cannot abstain from thinking about 1968 the year when than generation took the streets in France and elsewhere and changed history. But the year is still 1960 and the verdict of the trial can be only one.The intuition of Clouzot is ahead of time not only in what concerns the historical judgment. It is also in the style of filming. Most of the film is a court drama in the American tradition of Kramer just translated in French. A few scenes however are filmed in the street part of the flashbacks that recall the story of the affair that ended in tragedy. Well these scenes are for all practical purposed New Wave. They do not only depict the Paris of the new generation they are also filmed in the style of the new generation of directors. Here Clouzot bends graciously towards the young directors that will defame him.And of course there is Brigitte Bardot. This is one of her best roles she plays the whole range of emotions she is capable of is beautiful and vulnerable passionate and desperate. She attracts men she attracts the attention she creates emotion. It is her against the whole world in a personal rebellion with no chance of success. With this film she established herself as a serious actress not only as a popular star. It is her film to the same extent that it's Clouzot's and it is one to remember.".

JeanLuc Godard's CONTEMPT 1963  unquestionably the finest of the lot  and Louis Malle's A VERY PRIVATE AFFAIR 1962 VIVA MARIA! 1965 and the William Wilson episode from SPIRITS OF THE DEAD 1968. As for director Clouzot this was his last mainstream film  since his next Inferno begun in 1964 would be aborted due to his poor health and a subsequent one LA PRISONNERE 1968 was perhaps too 'specialized' read extreme to cater for other than 'underground' audiences! For the record I still need to watch his MANON 1949 and LES ESPIONS 1957 from the ones I own. THE TRUTH  included in the alltime top 3000 movies ranked by the Wonders In The Dark website  was the only title involving either to be nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar incidentally it is preceded by the Columbia logo and apparently was simultaneously shot in English as per contemporary posters! for what it is worth the film deservedly missed out to Ingmar Bergman's beautifully stark parable THE VIRGIN SPRING 1960  even if they actually emerged joint winners at the Golden Globes! Anyway what we have here is the trial of a crime of passion with the star herself in the dock the backstory of which is then seen in flashback  triggered off by the interrogations of various witnesses. Clouzot managed to rope in an impressive supporting cast for his plethora of characters Charles Vanel as Bardot's practiced Defense Counsel Paul Meurisse as the showy Prosecutor  incidentally both these actors had already appeared together for Clouzot in one of his greatest works DIABOLIQUE 1955  and youngsters Sami Frey and Jacques Perrin among the uninhibited what else? protagonist's numerous lovers the former being also the victim in the case.The director's renowned clinical eye for detail is well in evidence throughout  but the film's two sections do not necessarily jell in this particular instance perhaps tellingly the 122minute movie had as many as six scriptwriters assigned to it!. The narrative proper then seems to belong to the 'wasted youth' trend kickstarted by Federico Fellini's I VITELLONI 1953 indeed despite their highbrow aspirations musician Frey juggles a relationship with Bardot and her 'saintly' elder sister all the while attempting to set up his own orchestra! these singularly colourless personages come across as lowlifes more than anything else the crime itself followed immediately by the heroine's attempted suicide is easily the standout here. Conversely the backhanded tactics prevalent in the overcrowded courtroom lend much cynical enjoyment  thus countering the necessarily static nature of the cinematography during these sequences.Still the film is considered as the one in which the star gave her best performance she even won the Italian equivalent of the Oscar for it as Best Foreign Actress though the events leading up to the night of the crime and where the real guilt lay hence the title are hotly debated by both sides it is inconceivable to accuse Frey who could hardly be blamed for lusting after Bardot over her whose feelings for him  whether genuine or merely to spite her square sibling  are never properly definedwhich is perhaps why the trial ends abruptly as it does! In retrospect the movie can be seen to have much in common with the aforementioned Inferno  whose troubled shoot was delineated in a featurelength documentary released in 2009 after Claude Chabrol had already impressively refashioned Clouzot's original script for his own 1993 effort L'ENFER.".

It's a lastwomanonEarthstory  think about Robinson Crusoe The Road I am Legend but very naturalistic except for the wall which traps the protagonist in a secluded alpine area. It was a bit toned down from the book  some of the more violent or disgusting passages were missing I guess not to alienate the audience too much since the story is intense enough already. This seemed to work as WOM is quite good everybody was discussing it on our way out. My son who didn't know the book was impressed too. Also left out were any references to the cold war which were not that important in the book to begin with here the wall is more like a natural catastrophe and the story is much more timeless this way. From a technical POV this was excellent filmed with a REDto35mm and much natural light I think. Most of the crew hail from TV productions but it's clearly visible how much fun they had with the wide format. Sound design was good too. Music was sparse a few Bach sonatas. And I liked how they didn't colorgrade the thing to death as happens sometimes The Road Children of Men ...  the story is bleak enough without much fiddling  we get the message. The landscape wood and winter sequences are just beautiful. Highly recommended if you're able to see this. Maybe it gets a foreign run there's nearly no dialogue most spoken text is just offscreenquoting from her diary so subtitles or dubbing won't really take away much.".

The plot made me profoundly think about humanity nature life... and if a movie succeeds in doing that it deserves merit. I also like that multiple interpretations can apply to the movie since it has a certain symbolical feel to it rather than being a science fiction or utopiandystopian story. I for example see a lot of parallels with someone who has a depression not being able to fight an invisible wall struggling to do everyday tasks in order to survive feeling alienated. It's great how the connectedness with nature is illustrated. How we depend on nature and how nature depends on us. How we humans are gods who are able to choose to kill or let live who can choose to kill the very nature that makes us survive.

The acting is nuanced controlled. The sense of menace is achieved with lighting and camera work. No false scares no misleadings no cheap shocks.This tale of survival and endurance ultimately about the meaning of humanity is a moving masterpiece that will stay with me a long time.".

A scifi concept movie I should say there are no lasers or spaceships or any other hitech stuff to be seen. A woman her name is never mentioned goes on weekend in a mountain cabin with and elderly couple. The couple leaves to take a walk but never returns. Reason the Wall or 'Die Wand' an energy forcefield which keeps everything from going out or coming in. This leaves this woman completely cut off from civilization society and basically everything she knows and loved. Obviously this is what this film is about. It's not about explaining why this wall is there or who built it or for what reason. It's about the mental emotional and ethical problems that arise when there is no more society to live work and function in. This film was apparently based on a successful 1963 Austrian novel. The whole film is told via the voiceover of the woman she never has any direct dialogue and all the acting is delivered through expressions or actions. This was smart on the part of the filmmakers coz it works well and it feels a lot like a book. Although the film lasts only 103 mins it does have a slow pace but like a book you have to take time to see it at the pace it's intended to. Recommended!".

	schema:reviewBody "This film will not appeal to everyone but it certainly appealed to me. I'm a big fan of films and books depicting people in isolated alienated circumstances whether physically alone or within the boundaries of society. The Wall effectively portrays this unnamed woman's solitary confinement behind an invisible wall while the world outside has stopped functioning as she knew it the apocalyptic reason is never brought to light and is really not necessary and the couple at the cabin is an effective symbol of the frozen state of time and circumstance. The woman develops a tenderhearted relationship with the animals she must nurture and care for as she learns to care for herself and survive. Certainly the viewer like the reader can draw many conclusions about the nature of solitude isolation alienation and human psychology. The film invites that kind of thinking if not open dialog. The woman experiences a wide range of emotion desperation yes but also solace and even joy in her steadfast self reliance and the beauty of the world to which she is given access scenes of the night sky are particularly moving. The outlook is ultimately a bleak one though and expect no clear resolution. This ambiguity may be offputting to viewers who would prefer the woman find a way out encounter a rescuer or at least discover a partner in her exile which makes one of the events in the film all the more horrific. If for no other reason watch the film for the fine acting exquisite scenery and dramatic depiction of nature. I have not yet read the book on which the film is based but am looking forward to doing so. I congratulate the filmmakers for bringing this story to a wider audience.".

So halfwayhouse it is then.What went wrong? After the mysterious setup of the invisible wall and two excellent early scenes involving frozen neighbours and a car the story winds down into solipsistic musing about the oneness of nature which can be quite interesting. A monologue describing how the forest's thoughts are becoming one with her own was profound putting into words something some of us may have felt from time to time.Near the end there is a disappointing dramatic incident which feels contrived and even then the story syncs back into its stoic pace ultimately leaving us entirely underwhelmed. It must also be said that we watching together with my partner needed 3 evenings to get through the whole film having had to break it up into three shorter parts as we always fell sleepy. Regarding characterisation it's typical of modern melancholic German drama stark sparse stoic and frankly too monotone for the viewer to achieve much sentimental connection. Recommended ifyou appreciate landscape cinematography filmed in the stillpicture style. Almost every picture is a keeper.you are interested in an oblique story about a woman's necessary connection with animals and nature away from everything else. you enjoy a really slow pace with many long scenes where literally nothing happens other than inviting the viewer to soak up the atmosphere.you prefer to objectively identify a film's strengths rather than subjectively enjoy the ride.you have trouble getting to sleep.Not recommended ifyou're tired of bland characterisation and dull pacing in German film.you're expecting a scifisupernatural mystery.you like some kind of realworld explanation.you prefer the camera work to offer more variety than the stillpicture style.you don't enjoy encrypting metaphor.".

There is neither plot nor resolution. I want to believe that I was wise and patient enough to enjoy a film like this when I was younger but I have my doubts. The only possible flaw in the filmmaking was to give too much attention to the wall in the first third of the film i.e. almost to the extent that science fiction or fantasy was being introduced. Whatever shortcoming such might create is certainly overcome by the virtues that follow.

There is neither plot nor resolution. I want to believe that I was wise and patient enough to enjoy a film like this when I was younger but I have my doubts. The only possible flaw in the filmmaking was to give too much attention to the wall in the first third of the film i.e. almost to the extent that science fiction or fantasy was being introduced. Whatever shortcoming such might create is certainly overcome by the virtues that follow.

	schema:reviewBody "Die Wand or The Wall was Austria's foreign language submission to the Academy Awards the year after Amour took home the big prize. This one failed in making the list but it is nonetheless an excellent movie. I guess it did not really do well with awards bodies as even with the Austrain film Awards it did not score a single win when Ulrich Seidl's newest work dominated the categories. The movie is written and directed by Julian Plsler based on Marlen Haushofer 1963 novel. The film runs for roughly 100 minutes and basically we only hear Gedeck narrate and see what she is narrating in these scenes. There are a handful more actors in this film but all only very briefly while Gedeck still very stunning at 50 is in it from start to finish. Her narration is actually based on diary entries. She is already further in the future than what she tells us about. She knows things we do not know. The plot is as simple as it is effective. A woman wants to spend some quiet time in the mountains but she quickly realizes that there is an invisible wall there holding her prisoner. She can see other people through it but they are not moving. Are they dead? Is she dead? Is she hallucinating or suffering from a psychological illness? What happened? One of the film's biggest strengths is that there is no solution in the end so feel free to speculate and discuss all the way. It reminded me a bit of Jrgen Domian's book The day the sun disappeared.12 minutes into the movie the first crucial thing happens when her dog runs into the invisible wall. Yes she has a dog also a cow and a cat and also some young animals freshly born into this devastating scenario. They keep her company and possibly also keep her from going insane. Dog in a drama movie usually not a good prospect for the dog. Same here. The scene when she meets the man near the end is a very pivotal one. Pay attention to how she completely neglects approaching him in order to find a solution to hertheir imprisonment. She did not think about it one second. All she thinks about is revenge for what he did to her companions. Listen closely to what she says about she got rid of his corpse compared to how she got rid of her dog. The tragedy is also referred to earlier in the film when she mentions her the death of her cat the first time that she was facing loss. Or how she talked about the death of her dog long before it happened in the film. Apart from that what makes her interesting is also that we do not find out about who she was before coming to the mountainside. Also the audio is excellently done. There's is silence for most of the film and I really liked the contrast between the forced happy music Gedeck's character forces herself to listen to in the car and the general atmosphere.This is the kind of film which is always worth a watch but much more effective on the big screen so be grateful if you have a home cinema or managed to watch this at your local theater. All in all it is a dramatic tale on isolation but there are some horror elements too like her nightmare. It's one of the most atmospheric and metaphorical white crow films I have seen lately and is highlighted by Gedeck's outstanding lead performance. And last but not least it has an excellent ending as the movie ends when she has no sheets of paper anymore and so is forced to stop with her diary entries. Highly recommended.".

Her isolation behind the barrier grows more surreal as hours then days then weeks pass. Sounds like a cool premise right? I mean how is she going to get out? I mean she's going to spend most of the movie figuring out the nature of this wall and then trying to escape it right? When she first encounters the wall she's on a path. Next to the path is a river where water is clearly flowing through the wall  wouldn't you I don't know try to swim in the water to see if you could get under the wall? Throw rocks at it to try to see how high it goes it does seem like birds are able to cross in and out of the wall and rain snow and wind still exist so it's not like a dome. If you happen to see someone two years after this journey wouldn't you maybe try to talk to him to see where he came from even if he just killed your dog instead of just murdering him? You and I probably would because we are not vehicles for philosophy. The woman however exists solely as a vehicle for philosophy so nothing she does makes any sense. She's too busy contemplating her aloneness than to try to do anything about it. So we the viewers of this beautifully shot movie it really is gorgeous! must suffer through her loneliness with her rather than see her try to do ANYTHING about it. She never digs a hole on the border of the wall to see how deep it goes. Instead she spends 10 days waiting to be rescued and then just accepts her fate. And that happens about 1015 minutes into the movie so get ready to philosophize!".

	schema:reviewBody "The protagonist awakes one day in a hunting lodge. Her husband and a friend had left to run errands in town she was alone in the lodge. When she walks to town she finds an invisible wall keeping her from progressing. As time passes by she finds there is no escape at all.During the next two years she learns to feed herself in a sustainable way. There is a cow in the region she can reach she grows and harvests hay for the cow in return for milk. She cultivates potatoes and some other roots and collects berries and mushrooms. She hunts for the occasional deer and learns to shoot a rifle quickly and accurately.Her other companions are her dog Lynx a pregnant cat who scrounges off her and a white crow that is outcast by the black crows.We follow her narration of events which mirrors her writing on the paper she happened to have at hand. There are ups and downs including the loss of Lynx and the cow's baby bull both killed by a murderous poacher who is the only other human she was able to interact with.The film which consists of visuals that accompany the woman's narration as she comes to adapt to her unexpectedly changed environment comes to an end when she runs out of paper.ScoresCinematography 1010 Sharp clear wellfocused and framed. The landscape in Austria was lovely.Sound 1010 The vast majority of the sound is voiceover narration.

When she walks to town she finds an invisible wall keeping her from progressing. As time passes by she finds there is no escape at all.During the next two years she learns to feed herself in a sustainable way. There is a cow in the region she can reach she grows and harvests hay for the cow in return for milk. She cultivates potatoes and some other roots and collects berries and mushrooms. She hunts for the occasional deer and learns to shoot a rifle quickly and accurately.Her other companions are her dog Lynx a pregnant cat who scrounges off her and a white crow that is outcast by the black crows.We follow her narration of events which mirrors her writing on the paper she happened to have at hand. There are ups and downs including the loss of Lynx and the cow's baby bull both killed by a murderous poacher who is the only other human she was able to interact with.The film which consists of visuals that accompany the woman's narration as she comes to adapt to her unexpectedly changed environment comes to an end when she runs out of paper.ScoresCinematography 1010 Sharp clear wellfocused and framed. The landscape in Austria was lovely.Sound 1010 The vast majority of the sound is voiceover narration. There is good incidental sound for the wind in the trees pouring rain crunchy snow the sound of a rifle shot the footfalls of the dog and the like.Acting 810 There is one actor Martina Gedeck.

This is similar to that but it is better in that the countryside and the photography are lovely and worse than that in that there is the additional element of the miserably depressed woman. The couple who bring her to her cottage play ghastly pop music very loudly in their car presumably a hamfisted way of telling us perhaps through her perception how boorish they or all other humans are. Whether we see it as catharsis or denouement or as I do merely as confirmation of her hatred of mankind we see in the final moments of the film that the one human who somehow manages to penetrate the wall is cruel and vicious and the woman whose hatred of mankind may be seen as being responsible for creating this figure in her world expresses that hatred and takes her revenge by being extremely nasty to him.

Joan Fontaine is good too as the adult Jane although the character in this version is somewhat less interesting than in the novel so she has less to work with than Welles does.

This is my secondfavorite Jane Eyre running very close to the Timothy DaltonZelah Clarke version. This film definitely LOOKS better than the newer one since the newer one was a TV miniseries with let us say flawed production values. Other commentators complained about the darkness of the film but hey it's JANE EYRE! It's a Gothic novel! What did they expect? Welles is SUPERB  in spots he is better than Dalton and oddly I think he's rather sexier in this role. He really DOES show the charm that would have attracted Jane to him. SO why do I like Dalton's version better? Well 1 it has a better Jane. Joan Fontaine doesn't hold a candle to Zelah Clarke in the role. And 2  the Dalton version is longer and so stays closer to the book. Dalton himself excels but in a much different way than Welles. Welles' Rochester is definitely more worldweary and maybe not quite so petulant though both qualities are in keeping with Rochester's character in the book. If you only have two hours maybe THIS is the one to watch!".

I always believed this was the story of a woman forced to be what society felt a woman should be. Once Jane becomes the governess of Mr. Rochester's ward she feels free to be the woman she truly is strongwilled opinionated and passionate.Truly they just don't make movies like this anymore. Not just a love story this is a tale of finding oneself and realizing one's true destiny.";

	schema:headline " Charlotte Bronte's Byronic Hero";
	schema:reviewBody "If you remember any novel at all of Charlotte Bronte it is JANE EYRE her romance of a struggling governess who falls in love with a wealthy mysterious land  owner whose ward needs an educator. It is the story that has been filmed most often of all of Bronte's novels three films and a series as opposed to only one series based on VILLETTE and none for SHIRLEY or THE PROFESSOR. It is not as overpowering in it's appeal as her sister Emily's WUTHERING HEIGHTS but it is for most people a good romantic novel. It is also one of the few Victorian novels that is read today in fact it was used in an episode of FRIENDS when Phoebe and Rachel are supposed to be in a literature night school class.What was unique about the novel when it was published in 1847 was that it was rare for a novel to be told from the perspective of lowly governess and about unrequited love for her employer. This was really hot stuff for Victorian England though not as hot as Heathcliff and Cathy running wild on the moors of Yorkshire. The novel also gave Charlotte Bronte a chance to even one old score. The business about her being sent to the school run by Henry Brocklehurst was based on Charlotte's personal feelings about a school she had been sent to that was run by one William Carus Wilson. She felt Wilson was a hypocrite and tyrant this view has been disputed by scholars researching Bronte since the 19th Century.This is the best known version of the novel but it is not as complete a version as one imagines. The early part of the novel showing how Jane's aunt Mrs. Reed and her son John bully Jane as a poor relation is cut John doesn't even have any lines. Henry Daniell is effective as Brocklehurst in that his religious tyranny over his students is shown but the hypocrisy of his behavior in the novel his wife and daughters are fashionably dressed as opposed to the girls in his school is not commented upon. The subplot concerning the Rivers cousins is not included in the film. Possibly this is wise as it concentrates the narrative to Jane's hiring by Edward Rochester her growing love for her Byronic employer and her discovering of the shattering secret that derails their marriage.When the film was made Joan Fontaine was at the height of her career as a movie star. She had won her Oscar for best actress in SUSPICION only three years before. She fit the role of the quiet plain Jane heroine quite well. But in her memoirs NO BED OF ROSES she reveals that she did not like this film. Her costar got on her nerves. Orson Welles did the role of Rochester because he was trying to demonstrate to Hollywood producers that he was quite a good actor even if he was not directing as he wanted. But as it turned out he got involved in the production of the film  and he had some clashes with Fontane whom he thought was a spoiled star. That their scenes together worked is amazing.Of the others in the cast the two I find most interesting are Elizabeth Taylor as the illfated Helen Burns Jane's closest friend at Brocklehurst's school. It is a small part but the beautiful young Taylor makes it heartbreaking. But also note the performance of Hillary Brooke as the fortune  hunting Blanche Ingram who summarizes the reason for her defeat in this movie while playing billiards with her parents GOVERNESSES MAMA!!".

Based on the Charlotte Bront novel of the same name it stars Orson Welles Joan Fontaine and Peggy Ann Garner. Music is scored by Bernard Herrmann and George Barnes is the cinematographer.After a harsh and eye opening childhood orphan Jane Eyre gains employment at Thornfield Hall as governess to the young ward of Edward Rochester. A Difference in class and life outlook Jane and Rochester are by definition polar opposites but a bond exists a bond that surely can't conquer the mysteries of Rochester the man and the secret of his estate?Stevenson's version of the often filmed Jane Eyre has been pored over numerous times before the constant question that arises is that of just how much input and work did Orson Welles have in its production? Knowing what we now know of Welles' 40s output Jane Eyre undeniably has the Wellesian stamp all over it with Fontaine herself quoted as saying the big man was often found behind the camera. Not that Stevenson was a mug he himself would carve out a good career in directing further down the line but this take on Bront's famous novel shines because of Welles' presence.With that comes one of only two quibbles with the film as a whole namely it's Welles' portrayal of Rochester that dominates the film and not that of Fontaine's Eyre. The other problem naturally is that with a running time of just over an hour and half it was never going to be detailed adaptation of the novel. However what exists is still an excellent picture a film pulsing with aggressive atmospherics and simmering emotional passions. It has been argued that the opposing acting styles of Fontaine and Welles are a distraction I don't see it that way at all as one of classic cinemas greatest voices emotionally spars with one of its most beautiful faces. In mind of the difference of characters as written on the page it actually comes off as inspired casting. With the production that surrounds them perfectly in keeping with the characters' state of mind.The look is assuredly film noir with George Barnes' RebeccaSpellboundForce of Evil vivid black and white photography dovetailing splendidly with the matte paintings and Gothic set design. It still amazes me to this day that this film was entirely produced on stage 2 at 20th Century Fox! So many images burn into the memory. From the shards of shadows that accompany young Jane as she stands on the punishment stool at Lowood Institution put there by the despotic Henry Brocklehurst a menacing Henry Daniell to each chiaroscuro lit composition of Rochester in and around the oppressive like family home film has visual moodiness in abundance. Herrmann's The Devil and Daniel WebsterCitizen Kane score is crucially in tune as well. Orchestral swirls to portray Jane's longing are counter pointed by the menacing down beats that attack the viewer for Rochester's bluster.Away from the two leads it's young Peggy Ann Garner who delivers the most telling performance. She gives the child version of Jane a sorrowful edge that sets the tone of the film her early scenes with an uncredited Elizabeth Taylor beautiful and effectively correct in vocals are a lesson in child acting. The rest of the cast is filled out with admirable performances from Margaret O'Brien Meet Me in St. Louis John Sutton Captain from Castille Sara Allgood The Lodger and Agnes Moorehead The Magnificent Ambersons. It may not be a definitive Jane Eyre adaptation and the compromised ending knocks it down a point but all told it's still a top piece of classic cinema. 910".

Brilliantly filmed in haunting blackandwhite Stevenson's JANE EYRE is atmospheric romantic and enormously entertaining.Orson Welles and Joan Fontaine are the two principal characters Jane and Rochester. Fontaine brings her usual quiet skill grace subtlety and intelligence to Jane. While she is of course much too beautiful for a poor plain Jane Eyre she captures Jane's soul. Welles even if he does overact IS Rochester. Toby Stephens was memorable in the 2006 version yet in his emotional scenes reduced Rochester to a whining childman I blame the Method partially for this. Welles with his booming voice unusual looks and charisma is all man. Welles and Fontaine have a chemistry that quietly simmers away until their passion is fully expressedwith an embrace in the final scene.The early scenes of Jane's childhood are memorably stark with Peggy Ann Garner a truly brilliant child actress making an excellent young Jane. Look at the caliber of actors in this film. Welles Fontaine and Garner are just three. We also have Agnes Moorehead Henry Daniell perfectly cast as Mr Brocklehurst Sara Allgood and two other great child actresses Margaret O'Brien and Elizabeth Taylor. What a cast!The look of the film is perhaps the most memorable component of all. This seems to be an unusual production for Fox Studios who at that time were producing mainly film noir and contemporarythemed subject matter. JANE EYRE invokes incredible atmosphere the unearthly moment where Peggy Ann Garner cries over her young friend's grave in the foggy cemetery Welles first appearance on horseback and the moodiness of Thornfield Hall. Bernard Hermann's score contributes finely to the production and I have a feeling that even though Stevenson was a good director some of the film's best camerawork and visuals were contributed by Orson Welles. One shot in particular comes to mind Peggy Ann Garner standing on the chair alone as lines fall cross the frame and the shadow of Elizabeth Taylor slowly moves towards her.How spoiled audiences were in the Golden Age of Hollywood. In 1939 they had the excellent production of WUTHERING HEIGHTS with Olivier as Heathcliff. Both films audaciously threw away the second half of their source material yet are true classics.On a side note I wonder if David Lean was influenced by this film in his decision to make his famous Dickens production GREAT EXPECTATIONS later followed by OLIVER TWIST. Certainly the incredible mood produced here seems to be imitated by Lean in his two films.".

	schema:headline " THE BEST JANE EYRE  A classic.";
	schema:reviewBody "I've been having a Jane Eyreathon. There are many good versions of this Gothic story of the fight between worldliness and virtue. Many have one really outstanding element but this version with Orson Welles and Joan Fontaine remains overall the best. Like most it eliminates much of the second half of the book which is the really important part for Bronte who is one of the finest religious thinkers of her age. There are so many bests in this version it will always be hard to top for getting Bronte right.This version was shot when black and white filmmaking was at it's best and Fox was known as the best at noirGothic with velvety blacks and really crisp lighting and shading. One thing that helps this film be better is that it has the best script by Huxley Stevenson and Houseman. The script transitions well and really captures the major emotional elements of the story. This version also has the best child Jane Peggy Ann Gardner. I agree with many that Zelah Clarke Jane in the 1983 miniseries is probably the definitive adult Jane but Joan Fontaine is equally fine and many people will simply not sit through the slow miniseries. Joan Fontaine was not a glossy beauty and was usually cast as plain despite her natural loveliness. She has a real sense of refined restraint that seems very natural and her strength is not so much in knowing she is strong but overcoming her weakness. That is a very important mentalemotional component for getting Jane right.Orson Welles is beefy and sexy and plays every note of Rochester perfectly. If he is a bit too young for the role that is the only flaw. While I feel that Cirian Hinds the 1997 film version is the best Rochester Welles performance equals him. Once again the striking dark haired beauty Blanche was cast with a platinum blonde she is undeniably and great and striking beauty and is the best of the Blanche  easy to see why men like her and why women don't. Little Margaret O'Brien who I usually find cloying and hammy is of course the perfect Adele so we have the best Adele too! She is absolutely convincingly the daughter of a diva a dancer and coquette and her look at me peskiness is just right for Adele.The supporting roles just simply nail the characters as described in the book Broklehurst Agnes Morehead as the Aunt Mrs. Fairfax and young Elizabeth Taylor as young Jane's friend all add up to make this a masterpiece. Having Bernard Herrmann do the score doesn't hurt a bit either. Film buffs will find it of interest that some of the exact themes and sound cues used in this film were also used again in Hitchcock's NORTH BY NORTHWEST. See the 1934 version for a laugh and film history. See the 1983 miniseries to see the truest rendition of the book. See the 1997 version for breathtaking color scenery and Cirian Hinds' Rochester. See this to be fully satisfied. This is simply an exquisite film  filmmaking at its best in every respect and while not as letterperfectly definitive as the 1983 miniseries I feel it is overall the best truest version of JANE EYRE.".

There are so many bests in this version it will always be hard to top for getting Bronte right.This version was shot when black and white filmmaking was at it's best and Fox was known as the best at noirGothic with velvety blacks and really crisp lighting and shading. One thing that helps this film be better is that it has the best script by Huxley Stevenson and Houseman. The script transitions well and really captures the major emotional elements of the story. This version also has the best child Jane Peggy Ann Gardner. I agree with many that Zelah Clarke Jane in the 1983 miniseries is probably the definitive adult Jane but Joan Fontaine is equally fine and many people will simply not sit through the slow miniseries. Joan Fontaine was not a glossy beauty and was usually cast as plain despite her natural loveliness. She has a real sense of refined restraint that seems very natural and her strength is not so much in knowing she is strong but overcoming her weakness. That is a very important mentalemotional component for getting Jane right.Orson Welles is beefy and sexy and plays every note of Rochester perfectly. If he is a bit too young for the role that is the only flaw. While I feel that Cirian Hinds the 1997 film version is the best Rochester Welles performance equals him. Once again the striking dark haired beauty Blanche was cast with a platinum blonde she is undeniably and great and striking beauty and is the best of the Blanche  easy to see why men like her and why women don't. Little Margaret O'Brien who I usually find cloying and hammy is of course the perfect Adele so we have the best Adele too! She is absolutely convincingly the daughter of a diva a dancer and coquette and her look at me peskiness is just right for Adele.The supporting roles just simply nail the characters as described in the book Broklehurst Agnes Morehead as the Aunt Mrs. Fairfax and young Elizabeth Taylor as young Jane's friend all add up to make this a masterpiece. Having Bernard Herrmann do the score doesn't hurt a bit either. Film buffs will find it of interest that some of the exact themes and sound cues used in this film were also used again in Hitchcock's NORTH BY NORTHWEST. See the 1934 version for a laugh and film history. See the 1983 miniseries to see the truest rendition of the book. See the 1997 version for breathtaking color scenery and Cirian Hinds' Rochester. See this to be fully satisfied. This is simply an exquisite film  filmmaking at its best in every respect and while not as letterperfectly definitive as the 1983 miniseries I feel it is overall the best truest version of JANE EYRE.";

The first thing we see a leatherbound volume with the title Jane Eyre emblazoned on the cover the book opens to reveal the film's credits exquisitely lettered on the opening pages.  We're in danger of falling in love with the book as an object before the story even begins.  By the time Joan Fontaine had finished reading out Brnte's opening paragraph with the sentences themselves before me I was in no mood to watch the movie  I wanted to go away and read the book.Yet when it's not reminding us that it's at heart a version of something else it's a very good film falling not too far short of David Lean's Oliver Twist  which it resembles.  Both films were shot almost entirely in the studio yet don't feel studiobound they feel rather as though the directors had managed to find unusually claustrophobic outofdoor or in Lean's case urban locations.  In both films a portion of every frame is consumed by impenetrable shadow.  Yet Eyre is detailed and makes the best possible use of every frame.  Both films take place around in a callous England of the 1920s.  I got the impression that if Brnte's characters had for some reason gone to London they would have encountered Dickens's although this impression was destroyed when the rich Londoners visit Rochester's castle.  Both films manage to be sentimental in an agreeable way.  Both have excellent musical scores.  In fact this may be Herrmann's best score of the 1940s certainly better than the one he wrote for Citizen Kane which is seems better than it is because the film as a whole is a masterpiece.If you can make sure you see a print with a pristine soundtrack.  Orson Welles isn't always easy to understand.".

	schema:reviewBody "I love unexpected surprises. I was expecting a dull 19th Century affair. Instead I got one of the biggest melodramatic potboilers of all time. It's passionate pulling me along and hardly letting me catch my breath. It's powerful and it's actually hugely entertaining. Joan Fontaine plays the title character. Treated like garbage her whole life we follow a few of her childhood adventures Jane finally ends up in a tolerable place hired as a governess. Well it might not be Heaven but Thornfield is if nothing else an interesting place. A cute little French girl Margaret O'Brien an overbearing master of the house Orson Welles creepy halls unexplained fires and a frightening entity hiding behind a gothic wooden door bolted tightly shut. Heck this film is a good 60 horror film. 1943's best film I Walked with a Zombie is also based on the novel Jane Eyre. That film is pure poetry but the 1944 version might actually be scarier! The black and white cinematography is aweinspiring some of the best ever captured. It can be very very eerie. It's actually inspired  perhaps even pilfered  by Orson Welles' films to date. I wonder if he thought he was being ripped off? The acting is not perfect. Joan Fontaine as a thousand other people have probably pointed out is anything but plain as the character is supposed to be I've never read the novel  hell I probably should now!  but her plainness is expressed in the film. It's also easy to point out that she wears one expression throughout the film. However I don't think this is necessarily a bad thing. The backstory is so well done that that expression seems to fit the character quite well. Orson Welles either seems to be not in the mood to star in this film or he seems too eager to be superb. I can't decide but the result is curious. I wouldn't call it a bad performance certainly but it is not especially satisfactory either. Whatever other criticisms could be expressed he certainly never comes off as actually experiencing these situations with true emotions unlike Fontaine. Perhaps the best performance in the film comes from young Peggy Ann Garner who plays Jane as a young girl. She's simply amazing. Elizabeth Taylor appears in a small uncredited role. Wow she's young. All in all I really loved Jane Eyre. While I recognize its imperfections I wouldn't be surprised if my cable box gets stuck on Turner Classic Movies the next time it airs. 910.".

	schema:reviewBody "Charlotte Bronte's novel Jane Eyre is by far one of the great classics of all time.  Bronte somehow manages to bring to life a tearjerker of a romance out of the lives of sad and dreary people living dark and secretive lives.  It's no wonder that this book has gone on to be one of the great classics of all time and that it has been the basis of many film and television projects.  The book is irresistable.Jane Erye is orphaned as a young girl.  Her relatives find her too precocious to deal with and send her off to a strict boarding school. Completely cut off from her family Jane undergoes verbal and physical torture as the school attempts to beat her spirit out of her.  She comes out of the school welleducated however a little mousy but she still hasn't lost that attitude that they all seemed to loathe in her. When the school offers her a teaching position she flatly refuses advising them that she is still bitter.Jane takes a job as a governess for a Mr Rochester.  She is hired by the housekeeper to tend to Rochester's child an annoyingly sweet young thing complete with a French accent and petticoats.  Like Jane this child is lonely.  Her father is never around and it is assumed that the mother died. Unlike Jane the child is comfortable in a large mansion with plenty of people around to take care of her needs however as Ms. Bronte points out child abuse is not necessarily a product of being poor.Mr. Rochester travels for a living and rarely comes home.  Jane has already bonded with the child long before she even meets her father.  Jane is led to believe that Mr. Rochester is an angry driven man bitter over the tragic demise of his first wife.  When Jane finally meets him she finds that there is also a great deal of sadness.  Hence the beginning of a very quirky romance.Jane is described in the book as a shy but strong young girl.  In the book we are able to see into the brilliant mind whereas with a film adaptation and by the way it is played by Joan Fontaine we only ever see the waiflike exterior.  We all remember Joan in other 'frightened little chipmunk' roles in films like Rebecca and Suspicion. While she was capable in those parts she isn't quite as effective here.  She isn't able to convey Jane's unique perceptions and her stubborn bitterness therefore stripping away an important layer to the story. If only she would put into her work some of that spunk she showed in real life when she went to the mat with her feuding sister Olivia.Orson Welles on the other hand is perfectly cast as the male lead.  Bronte presents Mr. Rochester as a large man somewhat ugly but still a robust sex machine.  Welles is going through that period in the midforties between the time that it took him to realize that he would never make a film like Citizen Kane again and the time that he started to put on weight and lose his hair.  Welles is a burly guy not handsome but certainly prime!I would rate the movie as something worth seeing but I strongly recommend that one read the book first.  The film was nominated for Best Picture and Fontaine was mentioned for Best Actress.  It was very good in its day and it does hold up fairly well in large part because of the big names that star in it.  On the other hand it does not come close to the pleasure of sitting down and reading the story.  To put it another way this is the difference between going to Disney World or looking at someone else's photographs.".

	schema:reviewBody "Watching 'Jane Eyre' is like watching two films. The first part seems so far removed from what follows and is easily the best part of the movie. We see a young Jane Peggy Ann Garner being placed by her cruel aunt in an orphanage run by wicked Mr. Brocklehurst Henry Daniell at his most chilling. One of her schoolmates is a very young Elizabeth Taylor as Helen Burns long dark curls and eyelashes revealing her to be very beautiful even at an early age. And the wonderful John Sutton is the doctor who witnesses the brutal treatment of the girls at the school. All of this is conveyed in a brooding series of scenes lit with lowkey lighting and many atmospheric effects backed by Bernard Herrmann's moody background score. The second part of the story involving the mature Jane Eyre Joan Fontaine is less successful in keeping with the richness of detail shown earlier. Furthermore Joan Fontaine is never fully convincing as the plain governness demure and docile to an irritating degree. She plays the role so weakly that she is completely dominated by Orson Wellesoveracting to the nth degree as Mr. Rochesterand the story is sent reeling off course to an unsatisfying conclusion. The structure of the film is so offset by the impressive first halfhour that the second part seems artificial by comparison. Excellent black and white photography cannot conceal the artificiality of the sets. All of the supporting performances are well acted. As usual Agnes Moorehead does an outstanding job. Summing up a nice try but not quite the film it should have been considering its source was a classic novel. And by the way Joan Fontaine was not nominated for a Best Actress Oscar for this one as someone previously stated.".

A lot of hackneyed clichs jammed into the 90 minutes of the running time. Howard Keel plays a former Confederate who earns a pardon from the Union Army and an out from a federal prison by agreeing to join the Union Army but serve in the western frontier as opposed to the war in the east.Keel even rates a special job as sheriff of a lawless Arizona town called Colton after mayor Brian Donlevy calls for help. Saloon owner Scott Brady and partner Marilyn Maxwell like the wide open town that Colton is and don't cotton to no law and order.In fact Keel himself has never really forgotten his rebel roots and has been biding for time to pull something off.All these plot strands get themselves resolved in one of the dumbest Indian attacks I've ever seen staged on film. The once popular players set themselves all around with various weaponry on either side of the main street and the Indians ride by and just keep getting picked off.Others in Arizona Bushwackers include Barton MacLane Yvonne DeCarlo James Craig and John Ireland. It's a regular convention of movie names who hit their peaks during the forties and fifties. It's also the farewell film of director Lesley Selander who did just about a gazillion B westerns in his day.No matter how dumb the film it's nice to see all these stars together in one film. And the opening narration is given by a bigger movie name than all of these who did the off camera speech as a favor to his friend producer A.C. Lyles.For nostalgia fans only.".

As the confederate lawman up against gunfighters  and gunrunners as well as usual Indians . As the marshal on the trail of the smugglers is accompanied by a spy woman Ivonne De Carlo . Town boss Scott Brady is behind the crime and corruption of the little town called Colton but the townspeople are too scared to help sheriff out except for Saloon gal Marilyn Maxwell . In the Old west there are always the men who live breathe violence and the women who hold their breath.This ordinary western is plenty of thrills  go riding  shootouts and suspense as the dreaded final showdown approaches and the protagonist realizes he must stand alone against impossible odds  as his fellow town people for help  nobody is willing to help him  meanwhile he attempts to clear an issue about weapon gunrunning . This routine Western has the customary story of a sheriffforhire who takes the law on his own hands and based on a story and screenplay by Steve Fisher. It begins as a slowmoving Western but follows to surprise us with dark characters and passable plot . This short runtime tale is almost ordinary  a pacifier comes to a town just in time to make sure its citizenry but later the events get worse . Although made in low budget by the producer A.C. Lyles  it has its good moments here and there . Acceptable acting by Howard Keel as a Confederate spy who takes a job as marshal . Notable for the presence of old Westernmovie veteran such as John Ireland  Marilyn Maxwell  Scott Brady  Brian Donlevy  Barton MacLane and James Craig . Atmospheric and colorful cinematography in Technicolor  though is necessary a remastering.This horse opera was realized in lowbudget by producer A.C. Lyles and distributed by Paramount Pictures . Lyles produced a lot of Western in short or average budget such as Black spurs1965  Apache uprising1966 Johnny Reno  Waco  Red Tomahawk and Hostile guns67  among others  many of them directed by R.G. Springsteen or Lesley Selander and starred by old glories such as Dana Andrews  Rory Calhoun  George Montgomery and Howard Keel . This quickie was middlingly directed by Lesley Selander  a craftsman working from the 30s . Selander is generally considered to be the most prolific director of feature Westerns of all time with at least 107 to his credit between 1935 and 1967 . He realized his first feature in 1936 a horse opera  genre in which he would not only excel but one where he would spent much of the rest of his career . He began in this genre with series starred by Buck Jones and Hopalong Cassidy series starred by William Boyd such as Silver on the sage  Three men from Texas and Wide open town. In Republic production he directed his better movies such as Panhandleand Stampede starred by Rod Cameron and in RKO he directed Tim Holt in 20 films such as Rio Grande patrol and Overland telegraph. He subsequently shot Bmovies such as Fort Vengeance Arrow in the desert Shotgun Town tamer and his last picture Texas Kid. Although Selander couldn't be deemed an Alist director his movies had a professionalism and a verve that many of those made by his fellow B directors lacked . He also filmed detective thrillers  actionadventure motion pictures and even a horror film or two . Rating  55 . Acceptable and passable".

All things considered one may be thankful that it's as watchable as it is with an exceedingly tired script sucking all the life out of the film concluding with an appallingly feeble Apache attack that shows that director Lesley Selander couldn't wait to yell cut on what turned out to be his screen farewell after 135 features.

I say geezer western because Lyles created a niche for himself during the 1960 making a long string of lowerbudget westerns that all starred folks who had once been stars. Now well past their peak these folks and their very aged costars made some decent films. Few were standouts but most were entertaining and offered a last chance to see film favorites. In this case the three main stars are actually a bit younger than the typical Lyles film of the day with Howard Keel 49 Yvonne DeCarlo 46 and John Ireland 53. In supporting roles are Brian Donlevy 67 Marilyn Maxwell 48 Barton MacLane 66 and James Cagney 69 narrating. Oddly some of the usual supporting characters from Lyles' westerns such as Lon Chaney Junior and Richard Arlen are absent in this movie.The film begins by explaining that during the Civil War Confederate soldiers were sometimes offered a chance to enlist in the Union army and were sent out west to protect the settlers. Whether this is actually true I have no ideaperhaps it's all fabricated or it really occurredall I know is that if true this is a rather obscure notion. In the film naturally the residents of a small western town are dubious about having a 'Reb' appointed sheriff in their townafter all would be really care about protecting a bunch of Yankees?! All I know is that the current sheriff MacLane sure looks awfully old to be protecting anyone by the way in real life MacLane was dying from cancer and this tended to make him look a lot older.Soon the Confederate sheriff Keel arrivesand is nearly bushwhacked in the process in other words some baddies tried to ambush him as he neared the town. The owner of the local saloon sent the men to kill the sheriffso you know there will be a final showdown between them. In addition the deputy Ireland is very antagnoistic towards his new boss as he hates Southerners. For a while it looks like Keel is a needed force for justice. However you soon discover that he is actually a spyworking for the Confederacy!! What's next? See the film yourself.Overall this is a decent film but nothing more. Compared to other Lyles westerns this one is slightly below averageworth seeing but no more. The stars give it a good try but the script isn't all that convincingnor is the ending. Adequate.By the way one of the baddies killed was called Ike Clanton. THE Ike Clanton was at the O.K. Corral and actually died in the late 1880snot during the Civil War.".

The Italian Spaghetti Westerns had taken over so here was a throwback and that's also shown with the older cast.Not only do you have Keel here but there's also Yvonne DeCarlo James Craig Barton MacLane and John Ireland. Obviously this film was meant to be a throwback to older Westerns but the problem is that there's just nothing interesting going on here. The characters are all boring. The story isn't anything to brag about. Then you've got to wonder why the producer would think this story would want to be seen by anyone in 1968.Not only is the film very slow but it's just downright boring to the point where even the cast can't save it. The actors are all game for what they're asked to do but they just can't bring any energy to the material.

	schema:reviewBody "There's a reason why the western genre has on the whole died out. They were made ad nauseum from the 1940s1970s and there were infinitely more typical westerns than good ones so the public got tired of them. Yours truly is not a fan of westerns. They have to be really excitingor have a serious amount of eye candyfor me to enjoy watching them. Therefore you understand why I took a chance on Arizona Bushwackers a western starring the hunky Howard Keel. Unless you're desperately in love with him you'll probably want to skip this one. John Ireland was supposed to be a onearmed sheriff but he just had the end of his sleeve sewn into his trouser pocket and both sturdy shoulders were clearly visible. Yvonne De Carlo tried to give a Jane Russell impression and Marilyn Maxwell tried to give an Yvonne De Carlo impression. The townsmen with only one or two lines seemed like they either weren't actors or had gone to the John Wayne school of acting.

	onyx:emotionText "There's a reason why the western genre has on the whole died out. They were made ad nauseum from the 1940s1970s and there were infinitely more typical westerns than good ones so the public got tired of them. Yours truly is not a fan of westerns. They have to be really excitingor have a serious amount of eye candyfor me to enjoy watching them. Therefore you understand why I took a chance on Arizona Bushwackers a western starring the hunky Howard Keel. Unless you're desperately in love with him you'll probably want to skip this one. John Ireland was supposed to be a onearmed sheriff but he just had the end of his sleeve sewn into his trouser pocket and both sturdy shoulders were clearly visible. Yvonne De Carlo tried to give a Jane Russell impression and Marilyn Maxwell tried to give an Yvonne De Carlo impression. The townsmen with only one or two lines seemed like they either weren't actors or had gone to the John Wayne school of acting.

	schema:headline " Disappointing B movie western";
	schema:reviewBody "When I see a name like Howard Keel listed for a film I can't resist having a look particularly as Keel was probably my first screen hero perhaps alongside Roy Rogers as a six year old when I was taken to see Annie Get Your Gun. I still have vivid memories of him in that although it was around 65 years ago. I find it rather sad that stars like Keel ended up having to take jobs in feeble B westerns like Arizona Bushwhackers when they have so much more to give. Rather sad also that he's remembered better for Dallas than Seven Brides for Seven Brothers by some people. However on to this film Arizona Bushwhackers is a very tired looking picture that looks like it was made for TV rather like those Warner Bros series in the 50's like Bronco with sets where everything looks so clean. Everyone wears clean clothes with shirts perfectly pressed and dresses that look like they've just been hired from the fancy dress shop. The movie is packed with actors and actresses who have seen better days quite big stars some of them in their day like Yvonne De Carlo John Ireland and Brian Donlevy who doesn't look at all well here in fact he died a few years later as did Marilyn Maxwell. Barton McLane although only in his sixties looks about 80. Actors seemed to age far more quickly back then 1968 than they do today. Too much alcohol and cigarettes I think. The script here is very tedious nothing I've not seen in westerns hundreds of times before the colour is washed out and the direction listless and lazy. The final Indian attack is comical as this group of so called renegades just roar into town riding up and down and get picked off by the towns folk waiting for them. Must have been the most stupid Indians ever in a western. The only reason for watching this is to see your favourite old time movie stars of B films which does give one a sort of peculiar warm feeling as their easily recognisable faces appear. I thought John Ireland as a one armed deputy came off best in the acting stakes. Bless them all.".

Without giving any spoilers the plot involved various characters with hidden agendas all having converged on an Arizona town in the closing stages of the Civil War. Cowboys Indians Rebs and Unionists all thrown together could have had a bit of life but here the mix had no yeast and didn't rise. What should have been a climactic battle scene was a visual humor feast. The renegade Indians sat on their horses like targets at a Coney Island arcade but this was countered by townsmen not using any cover as they threw lead. In the usual BWestern tradition a hero with a 6gun was much more deadly than a Star Trek redshirter with a rifle. All in all it was depressing seeing these actors reduced to showing up for work in an effort like this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the second of Howard Keel's westerns for producer A.C. Lyles that I've seen in the last several days and the fourth of Lyles during that same period. They've all been pretty enjoyable for the conventional oaters they are in the compact 90 or so minutes they run for. Among other players from previous of Lyles' pictures are Marilyn Maxwell Scott Brady Brian Donlevy John Ireland. Also Yvonne De Carlo is the leading lady here. Keel is a rebel Southern turned Union soldier who becomes the new sheriff. But one doesn't know which side he's on until the middle portion. Anyway there's also the appearance of one Roy Rogers Jr. who shouldn't be hard to recognize especially since his character's name is Roy. Oh and as one would expect in these oaters Indians are also portrayed as savages though once they start moaning in pain one by one I couldn't help laughing since they sound soooo unconvincing! One more thing since Ms. Maxwell's character is from New Orleanswhich is a twohour drive from where I currently liveI couldn't help but think that just three days before when our house was out of power during Hurricane Issac I relistenedfor perhaps the upteenth timeto a cassette of her on The Abbott  Costello Show originally from the radio days of the '40s and she was singing Do You Know What It Means to Miss New Orleans? during what the announcer referred to was New Orleans Jazz Week. Incidentally this particular ep had the comedy duo performing Who's on First? since this was also the week Joe DiMaggio was recuperating in bed. Okay so in summary Arizona Bushwackers was another of these oldfashioned westerns that I managed to enjoy for the entertaining yarns they are. P.S. James Cagney did the beginning narration for his old friend Lyles who produced the only picture Cagney directed Short Cut to Hell.".

I suspect there were some scenes filmed that just didn't stack up so full credit to whoever edited this down. I can guarantee the best bits made it into the final cut. At no point does the movie hit a lull. Also not mentioned often is that the truncated soundtrack is pretty decent for such a lowbudget entry.And by best bits I mean some of the funniest comedy of the 80s. Michael O'Keefe's character gets embroiled in a love story which fortunately never detracts from the humor of the film leaving Paul Rodriguez to provide rapid fire comedy and boy does he deliver. The movie bounces from classic scene to classic scene with Rodriguez getting most of the great lines delivered in an arch manner that prevents the viewer from disliking him or thinking him obnoxious. For me the comparisons to Dumb and Dumber are off the mark as neither of the two principal characters in this movie are portrayed as idiots. Because of that it's a bit more challenging to wring laughs from them but the script successfully answers that challenge. There's plenty of broad humor but it's backed up by snappy dialogue.I don't suppose this will ever get its due but if you've just seen this for the first time welcome to the club. There are some more of us out here that got it too.".

The Return of Martin Guerre  published by Harvard University Press 1983This case was thought of as unusual even during the 16th century. So much so that it became part of French folklore. Earlier Hollywood movies likely tapped into this folklore when they penned similar stories.So this film rather than simply being another in a long line of similar movies is the first to tackle the original story. That being said the movie is not perfect and strays from the facts a great deal. Natalie Zemon Davis herself states in her introduction to her book that she was troubled by the film's creative license with history.Nevertheless I recommend anyone to see this film yourself and make up your own mind.

I think I still have the same opinion although meanwhile it ties with Les Misrables.Now today I watched it again. I couldn't remember anything really just parts of scenes and what happened at the end of course. But then everything came back. The music suddenly seemed familiar the village the faces. I still was surprised to see Tcheky Karyo's name in the credits at the end because I missed him completely while I recognized Dominique Pinon at once much younger of course. Again I stood in awe of the costumes and the village scenery. Everything was so convincing and realistic. As if someone had done a time travel and brought back a video. After The Name of the Rose this is the best period film till now. In the art department. But also certainly in acting writing and directing.Grard Depardieu and Nathalie Baye deliver performances which are outstanding. Every acting student should watch them they are masters of their profession. They show emotions which are almost palpable you feel with them certainly towards the end but also during the rest of the time. The script offered them only great parts and they created lives out of the printed words. Every gesture every movement every look fits and connects the viewer with the story. As if you're in the story not watching it. There is no doubt whatsoever that this story is real. Even if history should have been a bit different which I don't know the story in the film feels real.And I just want to add that everyone who calls M. Depardieu ugly or anything like it is not only extremely rude but obviously not receptive to any kind of charisma and aura. With actors as with people in general right? looks are not important. Whoever thinks that should switch from watching films to watching models. There he can get empty beauty.My recommendation is watch this film. You can hardly spend an evening in a better way. 10 out of 10.".

You get involved up to the point that you expect want things  to work out like you want them to be but you really can't predict what's going to happen next.The film tells about a true 16th century story about a man Martin Guerre who comes back to his village and family after an eightyears leave to a war. Everybody's really happy that he's come back that nobody questions the changes or differences after that long eight years until someday a vagabond says that he's not Martin Guerre. The villagers start to think the possibility that he may not be the man he claims to be.For me the film is about our judgment our perception our interpretation our motive. It's about adding a human value to the rules ethics customs and law that hold our society together. Sometimes what's right is wrong and what's wrong is right. In other words sometimes we're looking for a 'humane' solution. You'll understand what I mean after you watch this movie.The casting is wonderful especially the casting of Nathalie Baye as Martin's wife. Something in her eyes  perfectly reflects her character's sad life. She's beautiful. I imagine it's going to be very hard not to sympathize  with  her. Just watch this movie.

No one really questioned any of this until a disagreement arose between Martin and his uncle. At that point the possibility that this was NOT Martin arose and much of the movie consists of the court trials attempting to get at the truth. Exactly what occurs I'll leave to the viewer so as not to spoil it.The acting is wonderfulparticularly Gerard Depardieu. The costumes are also very good and fit the era well. And the movie is a lot more interesting that the American remake Sommersby in every way. The story is awfully complex and interesting as well but it does at times drag a bitso some with shorter attentionspans and little interest in period dramas would certainly be put off by this. I loved it but given that I am a history teacher this isn't so surprising.An interesting tiny and unimportant mistake that my wife noticed was that the inside of the church in the film shows very very faded painting on the walls. However when the film was to have occurred they probably would have really been fresherand a lot brighter. I never noticed this but she was right.".

It truly stays true to history as much as possible.I found it interesting that the film came into being only because Coras had written about this otherwise obscure occurrence. Furthermore the way the characters were portrayed in such a true to form manner that made this film even more worth watching. I found the entire trial scene as particularly interesting. Also the scenes from the farm give true insight to what 1500's Europe may have been like. I also give high marks to the social commentary showing how far someone can go for financial gain and how something that started solely as for personal gain continues to go on because those involved appear to be satisfied with the arrangement. this is very insightful as to how it related to human emotion.i strongly recommend this film to all especially to those like myself that like true local historic themes.".

In that film a Czech soldier Karel Hasek Micheael Redgrave assumes the identity of a dead British soldier Geoffrey Mitchell in order to survive and when he is sent to a P.O.W. camp he is obliged to correspond with the dead man's wife Celia Rachel Kempson in order to maintain the pretence and gradually via this correspondence they fall in love but when at the end of the war Hasek meets Mitchell there is no question of his pretending to be her dead husband. Daniel Vigne has taken the novel by Lewis and adapted it for the screen. By setting it a few centuries in the past both writer and director distance it from The Captive Heart and do so further by depicting the real Martin Guerre in situ with wife Bertande Nathalie Baye then after establishing his indifference to Bertrande he is allowed to abandon her. Years pass and Martin returns in the shape of Gerard Depardieu who is able to assuage doubts about his identity via his wide knowledge of both Bertande and the neighbors. There's not a great deal of suspense it's fairly obvious that Depardieu is NOT the Martin Guerre who left the village but Vigne is more concerned with illustrating that Good can come out of Bad living with Depardieu Baye is much more happy than when living with the real Martin and the faux Martin also proves a much better neighbor so it's just a question of waiting for the bubble to burst and wonder if hope will triumph over knowledge no such luck and the lovers will be allowed to live happily ever after. Both Depardieu and Baye turn in first class jobs and the period setting is well photographed. If not exactly a 'mustsee' it is well worth seeing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Martin Guerre was a young man who in 1548 disappeared from the southern French village of Artigat after being accused of stealing grain from his father. Eight years later a man arrived in Artigat claiming to be Martin. He was accepted as such by Guerre's wife Bertrande and family and lived with Bertrande as her husband for three years although some villagers entertained doubts about his identity. Rumours encouraged by Guerre's uncle Pierre who was involved in a property dispute with his supposed nephew began to spread that this Martin was in fact an impostor. He was arrested and placed on trial but his intimate knowledge of Guerre's past life and the support he still enjoyed from many villagers seemed likely to secure his acquittal. During the trial however there was a dramatic development another man turned up claiming to be Martin Guerre. It was quickly established that the newcomer was indeed the true Martin and that the impostor was in reality a man from a neighbouring village named Arnaud du Tilh. Du Tilh was convicted and subsequently hanged adultery and fraud being capital offences in the France of this period. A number of writers and filmmakers have taken inspiration from these events Whereas the later American film Sommersby tells a fictitious tale loosely based upon the story of Martin Guerre transferring the action to nineteenthcentury Virginia Daniel Vigne's film is a reasonably accurate version of the historical events aiming at a reconstruction of 16th century French peasant life. The main role that of du Tilh is taken by Grard Depardieu possibly France's finest modern screen actor. His attempts to conquer Hollywood have not been very successful but I have never seen him give a poor performance in his native language and this is a fine one playing his character as a plausible and at times almost likable rogue. He is particularly good in the electrifying trial scene. Whatever else du Tilh may have been he was clearly a consummate actor and Depardieu's impassioned speeches reflect his character's knowledge that he needs to give the performance of his life as that life now depends upon his acting skills. Just as it seems that du Tilh has succeeded in his imposture Vigne interrupts the proceedings with a brilliant coup de cinema the sight of a man with a wooden leg entering the courtroom. Or rather the sight of the wooden leg itself the angle from which the scene is shot means that we see this before we see the man's face. We have heard it suggested that the newcomer cannot be Martin Guerre because the real Martin after leaving the village joined the army and lost a leg in battle. Other acting fine contributions come from Roger Planchon as Jean de Coras the humane and sceptical lawyer in charge of the investigation and Nathalie Baye as Bertrande a young woman placed in a difficult situation by the return of her supposed husband. It is implied that Bertrande despite her doubts welcomed du Tilh into her bed because he was both a better lover and a more considerate husband than the departed Martin who seems to have been deficient in both departments. I would perhaps have welcomed a greater exploration of why du Tilh might have tried to claim another man's identity although Vigne possibly wanted to create a sense of mystery by keeping alive as long as possible the thought that Depardieu's character might actually be the real Martin. Vigne makes use of few bright colours other than the green of the vegetation and the red of the judges' robes during the trial in the days before chemical dyestuffs bright colours did not play a large part in the lives of the peasantry. Visually however the film is suffused with a warmth of tone reminiscent of an Old master painting I was particularly put in mind of the works of Breughel and Georges de la Tour celebrating peasant life. It is sometime said that the British are obsessed with the glories of their past and that in the cinema this is reflected by the large number of films made on a historical theme. French filmmakers however seem equally obsessed with history and this was particularly true in the eighties and nineties. Le Retour de Martin Guerre is one of a number of fine French films on a historical theme to date from this period. Others include Jean de Florette Cyrano de Bergerac and Le Colonel Chabert all of which also starred Depardieu. It is wellfilmed and wellacted and takes an intelligent and humane look at the strange historical events which inspired it. 810".

It is the third and final installment of the chicken series and once again it is directed by Vivian Naefe who is also one of several writers adapting the novel by Cornelia Funke. Most of the actors from films 1 and 2 return for this one and this includes grownup actors like Ferres Schwarz and Frmann as well as the child actors. One exception is Paula Riemann but honestly she was forgettable anyway and even a relatively limited actress like Sonja Gerhardt is better than Katja Riemann's daughter. Now about the story here a lot of the film is about saying farewell and recollecting some memories. This was done pretty well for the most part and I can see it delivering a bit of an emotional note to people who enjoyed the previous films.I myself did not really like them that much to be honest. i think the level has been generally pretty mediocre during the entire series but hey at least it did not really go downhill and if you liked the first film more than I did chances are good you will also enjoy films two and three. Now back to this one here The focus is mostly on more grownup subjects like comingofage and pregnancy also plays a major role here. The fact that the kids have aged also shows by the inclusion of a new group of chicks the next generation basically and also on one or two occasions there is talk about the whole chickpygmy references being too childish for them now. Like I already said this is not a problem and they found some nice closure eventually in this film. Sadly the story otherwise is relatively forgettable for example the whole part about this underwater cove etc. which did not add anything in terms of realistic relatable drama the way it was supposed to. Besides the second film was about chicks and love as you also read in that title and this one here is also a great deal about love and relationships but that's fine as it is just such a dominant subject for teenagers during that time in their lives. The weaker aspects also include stuff like Ferres' character being pregnant after a onenight stand with the central character's father. Yes a bit on the embarrassing side for sure. I think in general they were not doing too well on the comedy side to be honest. Very little wit included overall. Jessica Schwarz was once again wasted here and same can probably said about Benno Frmann. Finally I would like to say that it is a pity lead actress Michelle von Treuberg stopped acting quickly afterward as I believe she has the talent and the looks for a great career. She is even a really good singer. And I am also a bit disappointed that Jette Hering eventually stopped acting too it seems while some of he less talented child actors and actresses in here are still enjoying career. Pity. All in all I give this final segment a thumbsdown even if as you read in my review too there are certainly some upsides to it.".

	schema:headline " Wild chicks in and out of love";
	schema:reviewBody "Die Wilden Hhner und die Liebe or Wild Chicks in Love is a German children's movie from 2007 so this one has its 10th anniversary this year. It is the second of three films based on the children's novels by Cornelia Funke. The director for all three of these is Vivian Naefe she is also one the trio who adapted Funke's work for the big screen here. It is easy to see why all four writers are female as this one here a movie really designed for young female audiences. You can call it a bit of a female equivalent to the Wilde Kerle movies even if admittedly these Wilde Hhner films here are certainly not as bad as the ones I just mentioned.Now lets talk a bit about this one in particular The first is just about the kids going on a bit of an adventure together just like the third actually even if there the focus is more on coming of age but this one here the middle movie if you want to call it like that is all about love. The girls are in love with the boys the teachers are in love with other teachers the parents are in love with other parents etc. Love is all around. So actually this could also have made for a great Valentine's Day film but sadly the quality is not on a level where I would say yes this is a good watch. I also think that they are including too many stories and plots in here even for a 105minute film which is relatively long for a kids movie too. The play the relationships of Ferres' character the stuff about fatherhood the girls' relationships etc. Oh yeah and then there is of course a story about samesex love as well and resulting from that the film also deals with homophobia. I think this is too important of a subject for the way they handled it here. It was rushed in the elaboration was really weak and in the end they split up anyway. Not convinced. Not at all. Oh yeah sadly Jessica Schwarz is also completely wasted even more than in the first if I remember correctly and that's such a shame to be honest. Instead Veronica Ferres gets her own story line that could have been taken with the exception of the somewhat solid ending right out of a Rosamunde Pilcher movie.Talking about the ending I think it is fairly obvious that they knew already there would be at least one more Wild Chicks movie after this one. It's easy to see from the last camera shot and quote. Another negative aspect here is the music and what I heard convinced me that the cast really did not have a great deal of talent at all when it comes to music. That's perfectly fine but then don't let them sing and you have to blame the makers for this. Can't really blame the kids. Maybe you can blame the kids for some of the acting which wasn't really convincing though or blame the casting directors but there were maybe 2 child actorsactresses in here that should not have been cast because of their lack of talent. Lead actress Michelle von Treuberg really convinced me however and I think she did a good job with the material that she was given. I wish this film could have been much more about her character than about all the others. Also I wished she would still perform but looks as if she has been following other career paths for a while now. And this includes Paula Riemann as well who for whatever reason is secondbilled here. She has very little talent then again her mother is extremely overrated too and screen time.So by now you probably already realized I did not enjoy this film and I thought it was as weak as the first even if for other reasons. It is not a really bad or really disappointing work but the bad outweighs the good I must say. I dont recommend checking it out and my hope hat at least the third film will be better is relatively low unless it really mostly focuses on MvT's character. Anyway to end the review on a positive note still let me say that the sequence where they remember their oath from the first film early on while looking into this Wild Chicks book was touching and a thing of beauty. Sadly the only one here.".

The story is about a lady from Beverly Hills whom decides to take over her daughter's girl scout troop. Some of the lines were absoultley priceless the acting wasn't top notch however Carla Gugino pulls off her scenes really well especially when her parents forgot her birthday. Sure the plot was not new yet there was something refreshing that I got out of it. This movie made me laugh until I cried I really enjoyed it. Another cool scene was when the troop was singing cookietime I was rolling on the floor with laughter. This is all in all a family film and it's in my opinion a classic a gem of a movie.  stars and two thumbs way up don't pass up an opportunity to see this movie!".

This proves to be an embarrassing experience for the young girls seeking some much needed leadership from their mother who can't seem to gain independence from the luxuries of her Beverly Hills lifestyle. But once the pack is forced to compete with an aggressive survival squad of hard core rival troopers Phyllis and her team tired of being a laughing stock and also because Phyllis wants to gain her daughter's confidence and respect are going to prove that they're not just a bunch of whiny rich girls from Beverly Hills. 80s fans will probably recognize many of the young troopers from Jenny Lewis to Kelli Martin to Tori Spelling and I'm sure preteen girls are sure to like the movie for it's silly story young female cast and the goofy antics of Shelly Long. It's a hilarious little movie with a good message for kids about the importance of female independence Phyllis doesn't want her husband to think she can't fend for herself without a man's guidance as well as individual confidence.

I still think she is one of the best talents out there today but in Hollywood youth sells and women over 50 or 60 might as well be a hundred years old. Anyway the casting in this film is first rate with Shelley Long and Craig T. Nelson are the divorcing parents. Stephanie Beacham is always a pleasure to watch as one of her friends. Betty Thomas is delicious as the evil foe who tries to outsmart Beverly Hills Troop. Mary Gross is sweet as the unlikely ally in both parties. Audra Lindley is always a treat as well.".

I just think every aspect of the film is so funny...their daughterJenny Lewis of The Wizard another late 80'searly 90's gem having her own high beam for gymnastics being one of them. The wickedness of Velma Plendor fits perfectly...as does her final sequence one of my favourite parts the Kmart scene. Pure fun! Just thinking about this movie makes me want to see it again so I can remember all those classic moments. If you've never seen it find a video store quickly and rectify your error!!!".

This movie is like the moon all cheese but its campy 80s cheese at the peak of its cheesiness. No decade other than the 80s could have produced this film as it has a direct not so subtle attitude of rich people get a bad rap. So what if they don't like camping or first aid or low budget shopping they can 'survive' in the wild of Beverly Hills. It may just be me but this is an extremely shallow movie and yet it is never ashamed of being so. Even in the troops redemption at 'real' camp the troop comes off as a bunch of whiny rich kids. You can't help but side with the pesimistic outlook of ms. Plendor towards the troop because they're a bunch of spoiled brats who don't know what nature or hard work are. No true realization of the err of their way by the troop and Nefler and thus the film remains a cocky culmination of rich ideas and attitudes from the opening animated title sequence to the end credits. However its so dated that one can't help but be engrossed by its themes as ridiculous. Plus Craig T. Nelson Coach himself is in it along with a brief cameo by Cheech Marin Anie Herman boyoiyoiyoiyoing! so it has its moments. Its fun to look at the young girls of 1989 Hollywood which include Carla Gugino Son In Law TV's Karen Sisco and 1st season of Spin City Heather Hopper Saved By The Bell's Nikki Kellie Martin Life Goes On ER Emily Schulman the sister in the freakish 80s TV show Small Wonder and Jenny Lewis The Red Hed in The Wizard they capture a decade of idiocy and greed so well its fun to watch and scoff at the film's shallow message.

So is there still a spark? Its not certain. Also at this moment their daughter Hannah's Wilderness Girls troop needs a leader and Phyllis volunteers. Right away she manages to offend one of the Girls district commanders Velda Betty Thomas who gets upset when Phyllis turns a rainedon campout into a slumber party at a swanky hotel. More trouble arrives when Phyllis invents new patches for her girls to earn like jewelry appraisal and sixties dancing. But the troop is a quick study. In the annual cookie sales Phyllis and the girls sell more than 3000 boxes due to creative techniques. Velda's daughter's troop finishes second much to the leader's chagrin. Therefore at the upcoming wilderness survival competition out in the woods Velda vows revenge on Troop BH. Can she carry her badhearted plans to fruition? This film still leaves em laughing even though it will never win any awards. Long has one of her best movie roles ever as the shopaholic trendsetting housewife from 90210 while Nelson Thomas Mary Gross and all of the other cast members do nice work too. Look for Carla Gugino and Kellie Martin as two of the troop's girls! Also wonderful is the tongueincheek script which pokes fun at the lifestyles of the rich and famous while showing their glories at the same time. Naturally the sets costumes and photography are quite lovely. The evermoving comic direction completes this fun little flick. Are you having a bad day?

	schema:reviewBody "Which is maybe due to Constatin Gastmann being the only antagonist in the entire series that has at least a bit of acting talent. It also helped that Leon was not 100 the center of the film anymore at least in the first half. However if I rate a film 210 and say it is better than four other movies that says a lot about these films. This one here came out three years after the original movie and one year after film 2. And it is once again complete nonsense. The whole too old to be wild plot is as ridiculous as it gets especially as they made two more films afterward. The music is a complete disaster again especially when the young Ochsenknecht starts to sing about maturing. No talent in acting and even less in singing. Once again the director and writer is Joachim Masannek. Nick Romeo Reimann Vorstadtkrokodile Trkisch fr Anfnger is in a movie for the first time and Claudia Michelsen gives the possibly most embarrassing performance of her career which has quite a few lowlights. Uwe Ochsenknecht is in it for a couple scenes once again too to support his sons. Rufus Beck is not in here either. He did not return after the first film.The main antagonists here are a bunch of footballplaying girls called the Beastly Beasts. Apart from that it is the usual stuff from the first two films. The constant talk about being as wild as possible takes cringeworthy to new heights. The film is slightly longer than the second movie about as long as the first but shorter than the two final installments. It's the first film that did not score a nomination with the German Film awards in the children's film category. Looks like the Academy finally came to their senses about how horrible these films are. The negative highlight here apart from Masannek's writing which sucks as always is the smallest beast girl with the glasses. Man she was bad. Rarely seen such weak line delivery and I am surprised to see she got cast after his again. Maybe she improved. Here she is pure torture. The football plot gets less and less significant with these films and they include more story and character developments far away from kicking the ball. Wilson Gonzalez Ochsenknecht's part here is getting smaller too. However in the next film this is going to change drastically. He is even less talented than his brother. And what is with the constant fart jokes in this movie. Completely embarrassing. Do yourself a favor and do not watch this movie. Just horrible.".

	schema:reviewBody "Early 2016 I purchased four very low cost DVDs as a speculative purchase. Would they be fun second childhood food or not? One was Mean Girls 2 which I was not expecting much of. However the price was low and I do remember a review that suggested that it was a lot better if one did not expect it to be a true sequel. This is made to very different production values and is much meaner than the original but that could be the direction rather than the script.The others were Die Wilden Kerle 1 to 3. The DVD boxes were fully in German but the distributor was Buena Vista so I assume that there was likely to be an English language alternate soundtrack or at least subs. The first feature turned out to be German only but the other two had English subtitles.If I had read the IMDb reviews before purchase I would have avoided these. As is I found both 2 and 3 to be fairly typical of average quality features for kids. Technically weak but interesting none the less. I accept that such stories often get poor IMDb reviews. Personally I found these imaginative Wilden stories to be a breath of fresh air.The second feature involves a feud between a mostly boys sports team and its banker. The story flow is based on a pseudo vampire luring the team's best player away by careful use of romance something that the team itself does not have a clue about. A quality story.The third feature centres on a feud between the team and someone who left them in the early years friendship destroyed a different sort of love being central. All good stuff even though the acting feels weak. A nice extra for me is that this is a transgender story.I was impelled to get the disk of DWK5 and that is up to the same standard. In this the love theme is the bad guy having a type of love that sucks the victim into eternal chains eternal death. It also does not get good reviews but some should be able to get a lot of fun out of these stories despite that.In comparison Mean Girls 2 felt weak. It also reminded me of Disney stuff such as Camp Rock 1 and 2 but weaker. I can still find entertainment in Mean Girls 2 though.".

Rufus Beck and Cornelia Froboess did good in not returning and I wonder what the German Film Academy was thinking when they nominated this piece of crap for Best Children's film a second time??? It came out 1.5 years after the first and the only known cast member really is Uwe Ochsenknecht who is probably only in it because his kids are. The director and writer is Joachim Masannek again and his sons are back as are most of the other child actors.i have to say Uwe Ochsenknecht has a scene here and there where he put a smile on my lips but his sons are just useless in terms of acting and would never have a career without their established father pulling the right strings. Here the enemy is a pale vampire guy long before the Twilight hype who looks like a young retarded Jack Sparrow and that the female main character is interested in. Of course she is. In the end an evil witch is brought to life and she may have been the biggest wtfmoment in the entire series. The way she is depicted is plain horrible and it was so random as nothing before indicted any kind of supernatural characters in these films. Cringeworthy beyond belief. As is the music. Bananafishbones suck so much here and in the other films. Especially their closing credit songs are rubbish. The idea of making and using songs that depict the mood of the characters is a good one but the execution was a complete mess. The same can be said for pretty much all other aspects of these films especially the whole rambling about being wild. The plot deals with finding out who your real friends are but the whole script is not worth the paper it was written on. And why is the smaller Ochsenknecht son suddenly the love interest of Gries' character? In the first film it was still somebody else who randomly disappeared. Do yourself a favor and stay away. Oh wait the best thing about this film? It's the shortest of the five does not even run for 80 minutes not counting the credits so the torture ends soon.".

Since then I can't recall the book much and I have acclimated more to Wesley. But the focus here is on Connery in one of his truly superb roles as Captain John Connor on special assignment to the LA PD. Connery has spent years with and among the Japanese and when a prostitute is murdered inside Japanese corporate offices in Los Angeles Detective Snipes and Connery are on the job. The plot as it is isn't really very exceptional what is extraordinary is Connery's interactions with Snipes the Japanese and everyone else along with the for then astounding technology always a Crichton staple. I can just sit back and watch Connery in this role for forever. Highly recommended just on the strength of Connery alone.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rising SunThere is an old Japanese motto Business is war. Well that sentence is taken to new heights in the Philip Kaufman thriller Rising Sun based on the bestselling novel by Michael Crichton.Wesley Snipes plays Web Smith a JapaneseAmerican liaison officer in LA who is called on duty after a young woman is found dead at the opening party for the new Japanese company named Nakamoto. Sean Connery plays John Connor a retired liaison officer who is an expert on Japanese customs and culture. He is requested to come on call as well and does trailing along with Web.When they get to Nakamoto they find Tom Graham Harvey Keitel and other cops hovering over the body of the dead woman. Soon foul play is suspected and Smith and Connor must find the killer before it is too late.Rising Sun is taken from a great novel and turned into an average thriller. There is nothing spectacular about the film. It stays surprisingly true to the book but the very few things that stray from the course of the novel turn out to be the blunders.There are no sparks flying between Sean Connery and Wesley Snipes. I think that Snipes was a bad casting decision. Connery is perfect for the character of John Connor but Snipes just doesn't fit Peter Smith  whose name was changed to Web Smith for the film for no apparent reason other than Peter isn't a suiting name for Snipes.The directorscreenplay writer of Rising Sun  Philip Kaufman who brought us The Right Stuff  seems to have charisma and obviously tries to keep the film true to the book. Unfortunately however there is an element of suspense missing from the film. There are no real surprises. In the novel Connery's character John Connor seems to know everything that is going to happen but there is still a sense of suspense. In the film however Connery's Connor seems to know TOO much about everything that is going to happen. Instead of being one step ahead like he was in the book he seems to be twenty steps ahead in the film. There is one scene that really jumped out at me where Connor walks in and says upon discovering a man believed to be dead Oh I was wondering when he'd get here! In the novel Connor gives a reason why he knew the man wasn't dead. In the film he just seems to know the man is still alive for no apparent reason. If Connor knows everything that is happening everything that has happened and everything that is going to happen why keep Web  and us  in the dark? At least Connery fit the character of Connor  it would have been about ten times worse if they had chosen someone else.Believe it or not the film might have been better if it had NOT been so close to the book. What I mean by this is that by making everything just like the book Kaufman raises the expectations a notch and when ONE SINGLE THING is changed from the book the audience is disappointed because by then we have come to expect everything in the movie to be like the book. Expectations wouldn't have been so high if he had made everything different from the book. Which is NOT to say I don't enjoy that he stayed true to the book. It's a confusing opinion. In some ways I enjoy how true to the novel the film was. But there is just something missing. Even though the cast is top notch for the most part Snipes just didn't fit. And while Connery was perfect as Connor he seemed to know too much about what is going on. There is no real suspense. Perhaps that is the biggest flaw of the film.A great book turned into an average thriller worth seeing once.35 stars John Ulmer".

Rising Sun has its strengths in the technological sector using miniCD's in their security cameras something that rare...even in 2005 unheard of in 1993. Very interesting. This Michael Chricton venture has the right mix of corporate warfare and abrasive politics in each of the characters from the racist pig and Ugly American extrordinaire Tom Graham to the mysterious technowhiz played by Tia Carrare.But what I don't understand is how Sean Connery's character becomes such an aficionado of the Japanese culture? The explanation is very weak especially when it concerns his relationship with Eddie Sakomura. Snipes adds some bite and boldness to the mix but he plays into that not so bright sidekick stereotype that many AfricanAmericans fall into. It would've been more interesting if the roles were reversed.The ending is one of the most compelling scenes of the entire film...yes this would be considered a FILM not a MOVIE. It shows the bond of the conspirators falling apart piece by piece. First the senator's sexual escapade is revealed to his coworkers and his wife via fax machine. Then he interrupts an important meeting at Nakamoto headquarters by calling his copatriot thus revealing that Ishihara had something to do with this murder. Lastly the killer is unmasked and flees capture only to be cornered by Eddie's allies and thrown into a vat of wet concrete to his doom. I'll admit it its a frightening way to die but the killer sleaze ball lawyer deserves it. But must they change this ending at the last minute to replace Ishihara with Richmondthe killer? I thought movies were supposed to be art wrought with controversy.".

The actors have a lot of fun and the story is a splurge of entertainment but it's not paying enough attention to a couple of things. One of them is what its focus is. Is the film about the murder the two men solving the murder the clash of American and Japanese cultures or what? The other thing the film forgets could be a drawback of the first thing. It's that it doesn't tie up all its loose ends. At the end there are strands left with no ending even a mysterious ambiguous one. It just ends because it feels the pace of the film requires it to fade out at that particular point.The film is not bad mostly because it's far from boring. In fact there are many scenes of dialogue despite a few corny scenes of dialogue that are subtly interesting. We don't quite understand why the exchanges are interesting until later when we realize that the characters are so deeply contemplated that the scene felt as real as the room you're sitting in. But maybe I'm giving the film too much credit for simply being a load of fun for Michael Crichton to write. After all he wrote and directed one of the greatest heist films ever made The Great Train Robbery also with Sean Connery.Sean Connery of course is the highlight of the film because there's hardly a way he cannot be. Despite his irrepressible suavity he does not play himself. He plays a resentful inflexible selfindulgent veteran cop and we are supposed to like Wesley Snipes more because the film centers well seems to want to center around his character and also we're given more backstory and information on him. However we don't like Snipes more than him. Connery may play a stubborn old jerk but I'd rather one of those than a pompous intolerant overpround young jerk like Snipes can hardly help but play.I cannot reach a verdict on this film. How can I? There are so many things to enjoy at the same time they are hazardous to the film's health.".

	schema:headline " A solid enjoyable film whose pace covers it despite plot holes  the heavy cast also make it worth seeing";
	schema:reviewBody "During a high level executive meeting between a Japanese corporation and an US weapons contractor a young woman is found murdered. Due to his connections Captain John Connor is sent to lead the investigation with Lt Web Smith. The investigation is immediately hindered by the Japanese culture the shadowy business figures and political pressures however before long Connor and Smith are presented with a cctv disk that shows the murder being carried out by a known suspect. When the suspect dies in a chase the investigation seems over but a closer investigation of the evidence shows that the case is far from closed.Not being a real big fan of Michael Crichton I wasn't sure how I'd like this film  I'm not a big traveler and don't buy my books in the airport when I do travel! It was apt then that I wasn't overly taken by the plot here and felt that its pace was more responsible for it being an enjoyable thriller than any great skill in the writing. In its essence the glossy story takes in technology big business Japanese cool and political goingson  all these and other things combining to mean that it moves well and is consistently busy. This is not to suggest that it all fits together because it doesn't the plot has holes and lose strands within it that distract if you think too much about it  happily its pace and revelations did not give me too long to linger over these and I managed to enjoy it the problems being forgotten in all the gloss.On top of this gloss is piled a cast that is worth seeing no matter what they are doing together and their presence and ability further cover for a plot that doesn't always serve its many characters as well as they deserve. Connery has fun in the sort of role he seems to greatly favour now  distinguished wise men of age who can still dish it out if need be. He is easy to watch and only at times does he feel like he's forcing it like when he suddenly shouts. Snipes does not look as confident but that may be because his 'look' has dated here and changed since 1993. However he is still good and has his moments despite being given a rather secondary role to Connery's. It the support cast that surprised me though  so many well known faces in supporting or minor roles. Keitel is very good playing an interesting character that goes nowhere but is still interesting and well delivered Tagawa is gifted a fuller role than he often gets and does well with it. Wise is OK but he forces it and didn't convince me as much as I would have liked  still did the job asked of him though. People like Mako Carrere von Bargen and Buscemi all add depth and make the film feel fuller than it is even with some small and perhaps unnecessary? characters.Overall this is a slick and enjoyable film even if it is as much style and pace as it is substance. The plot doesn't totally fit together but its mix of technoconspiracy political plotting sex and intrigue all keep it moving along enjoyably enough and the impressive and rather charismatic cast only help to make it feel all the slicker. Worth a watch even if some may find it a little inconsequential in regards some bits of plotting.".

	schema:reviewBody "Here's another film that cops too much flack. It's an underrated movie which at times loses it's punch but it becomes such an engrossing movie that gets with the times. It's set around a big computer organization where everything's not black and white. We have a beautiful high priced girlmistress who's been accidentally strangled or was she murdered while engaged in a session of rough sex that got out of control. All evidence instantly points towards Eddie Sakamoto the son of the original owner of the business I think as he was in a relationship with the dead lass and they had argued at the start while singing Don't fence me in at karaoke where she just stormed out where he gives chase. The exterior trick shot outside the bar where the sports car is made to look really small as it takes off outside the park was a cool shot on Kaufman's part this is the dude that made The Wanderers. Enter Connery a cop was a mysterious past and Snipes who's assigned with him. The teaming up of these two is interesting. Like the Seagal characters Connery's here is kept pretty secretive as if almost boxed up. He's flawlessly great disposing of tight situations with a hand to the throat when muscle bound geezers give him trouble. We learn too about Snipes's background some but this film really opens our eyes to the deception in computer graphics and the falsity of misrepresenting images where's Eddie's may of been planted preferably by the killer and his goons possible employees of the business. RS is a nice cool mixture with the just the right of amount of sex it's hot especially naked sushi scene much alike to the one in the dreaded Showdown in Little Tokyo. There's nice looking broads and some action but on the surface it's a drama thriller but it's a very good drama thriller right to the end that has you wondering if the supposed killer that dies at the end is really our guy. These thrillers who's victim is killed right at the start Saigon Basic Instinct where the rest of the movie you're left to guess the killer I love. RS has it all  one big surprise plus some of those great actors from Reservoir Dogs Buscemi playing a pussy character in this too. We even have a car chase where at Snipes request these homeboys stall these not so happy Asians. The interrogation scenes with Snipes the interrogated set in before or after scenario's I liked too which really gave it an interesting and serious angle. These after scenarios could have you thinking they took place after the end of the story which is rather cool. After all poor Snipes has got enough personal problems. Also we have same real racial hatred going thanks to a conflict of opinions and ill favour. Don't believe the bad hype on this. Rent it today.".

The western and the music are mere karaoke images.  Americans had better learn how to bow because their masters are moving in.Rising Sun is a sophisticated thriller which flips neatly between fear of the sinister Japanese electronic surveillance big business buyouts Yakuza and a deep understanding of and reverence for Japanese culture.  Wesley Snipes plays Web Smith a lieutenant in the LAPD assigned to investigate a murder on the Los Angeles premises of a Japanese corporation.  He has Captain John Connor attached to him Sean Connery an older man who is believed to have 'gone native' and sold his soul to the Japanese.At every turn American shortsightedness is losing out to the Japanese hardball players.  One of the film's morals is if we don't like the way they are buying up our assets we have no business selling them in the first place.  Japanese strength comes from the social discipline and immense intellectual vigour of their way of life.  We may come from a fragmented MTVrapvideo culture says Conner but they do not.Conner has studied the eastern way and is respected by the Japanese for his grace and learning.  He guides Web Smith along the path of enlightenment in the course of solving the murder mystery.  They adopt the traditional sampaikohai relationship the tutelage of a wise elder from which a worthy young man learns.In this story of cuttingedge video fakery the film exploits images intelligently.  We see reflections of Web and Jingo on the TV monitor as they analyse the 'ghost'.  Connor effects a clever 'lookback' on the lab's video camera hinting at hidden permutations in the characters' relationships.  Time after time we are led persuasively down a line of reasoning only to find that it is a chimera.  As Connor says When something looks too good to be true then it's not true.There are some weaknesses in the film's structure.  'The Weasel' the journalist tracking Web is badly misconceived.  His place in the story is negligible and his dramatic possibilities are abandoned almost as soon as he is introduced.  The reliance of Web on his old 'brothers' to intimidate the Japanese pursuers is lame and patronising with its 'boyz'n'the hood' silliness.  To describe these 'rough neighbourhoods' as 'America's last great advantage' is patent hogwash.  The corrupt senator is the tired stockintrade of these thrillers and fails to convince.  The reaction of Morton's wife to the fax transmissions is utterly unrealistic and melodramatic.  That two LAPD cops should beat up half a dozen Japanese thugs using karate is frankly insulting even to Japanese thugs.The performance of Sean Connery is very impressive.  He plays Connor with the clear intelligence and the confidence in his own powers which such a man would surely possess.  He alone understands both cultures and therefore he alone can solve the riddle.  Because Connery is convincing the film is a success.".

	schema:headline " One of the weakest action thrillers I've seen in years.";
	schema:reviewBody "Rising Sun is an exercise in bad screenwriting. It presents a story about big bad Japanese businessmengangsters and the crooked sale of a massive corporation called Microcon. The movie starts off with a goofball karaoke scene where Eddie Sakamura the lead bad guy in another absolutely awful performance by CaryHiroyuki Tagawa singing a country song called Don't Fence Me In in a scene that's probably one of the most pathetic attempts to develop a three dimensional character in cinematic history. Ted Danson' Peter Lowenstein in Body Heat 1981 was three dimensional because he had an interest in dancing that went beyond his character's obligatory role in the film. Here this scene is thrown in at random just so we can try to pretend that this is a real person and not the facelss stereotypical bad guy that we see for the rest of the film.

	onyx:emotionText "Rising Sun is an exercise in bad screenwriting. It presents a story about big bad Japanese businessmengangsters and the crooked sale of a massive corporation called Microcon. The movie starts off with a goofball karaoke scene where Eddie Sakamura the lead bad guy in another absolutely awful performance by CaryHiroyuki Tagawa singing a country song called Don't Fence Me In in a scene that's probably one of the most pathetic attempts to develop a three dimensional character in cinematic history. Ted Danson' Peter Lowenstein in Body Heat 1981 was three dimensional because he had an interest in dancing that went beyond his character's obligatory role in the film. Here this scene is thrown in at random just so we can try to pretend that this is a real person and not the facelss stereotypical bad guy that we see for the rest of the film. Just after this terrible scene ends we are taken to the meeting about the sale of Microcon and the movie again trips over itself by trying in pathetic vain to create suspense during nearly silent deliberations over this sale in a conference room and if you manage to stay awake long enough a seedy murder soon follows the solution of which the rest of the movies tries to present.

	schema:reviewBody "Rising Sun is a forgotten decent underrated mystery thriller based on Michael Crichton's novel and that a good one. It is definitely the best of Sean Connery and the best one of Wesley Snipes. I know a lot of people are asking me the questions how come I like this movie but I totally dislike Passenger 57 but I like this one. For starters Passenger 57 is so cheese peace a st of a film who only grab cash and copy on a bad way Die Hard 1 and 2. This movie I like a lot and it is Wesley Snipes best performance a long side Sean Connery. Those two actors did an excellent job. The only problem with the film I have it is way too long and has less action they could have done a little better the choreography but the rest was good. Based on Michael Crichton's provocative bestseller this smart engrossing and electrically charged thriller is as entertaining as it is thought provoking. A special liaison officer Snipes is called in to investigate the murder of a call girl in the boardroom of a Japanese corporation. Accompanied by a detective Connery with unusual knowledge of the Japanese Culture the two men must unreval the mystery behind the murder by entering an underground shadow world of futuristic technology ancient ways and confusing loyalties.Also the cast includes Harvey Keitel CaryHiroyuki Tagawa Kevin Anderson Mako Tia Carrere Ray Wise and Stan Shaw. CaryHiroyuki Tagawa plays mostly the bad guys in the movies in this movie he plays the good guy who is a framed for a murder of his estranged girlfriend he didn't commit. Mako plays Yoshidasan the President of the Nakamoto Corporation. I really miss the actor he does such a good job playing the good guys like he was in The Perfect Weapon with Jeff Speakman. Sean Connery does an excellent job who plays A Scottishborn cultural liaison to the Japanese and a former Police Captain who is know with Japanese Culture and he worked there for years he knows Yoshidasan. This movie has so much Japanese Culture to tell with Sean Connery in it. Sean is so similar in the Japan that he played the character James Bond 007 in Japanese Culture in the movie You Only Live Twice 1967. Wesley Snipes does a better job playing Lt. Webster Web Smith LAPD police detective who also knows martial arts. In real life Wesley is real black belt in karate a martial artists. The movie is no were near classic cinema. But it does hold up pretty well some 24 years later. Connery is always perfect in every role he plays and Wesley Snipes at the beginning of his popularity proves his acting chops going up against Connery and respectfully Harvey Kietel. The movie is played of as a old fashioned type film noir but doesn't quite make it. For it's time it was an interesting mind thriller. Today it's a basic whodoneit. To me this movie is one of my favorite Wesley Snipes films and that a good one a lot Connery and Snipes complement each other as a buddy cop duo with Connery being mostly responsible for making this story interesting. The stillsuave exJames Bond plays the cool veteran and it's fun to watch him operate. The movie3 is so mystery it self who killed that call girl in the boardroom I always forget who was the killer and mostly why so good this movie to me is. This movie to me get's a B 710 but today no one talks about this film. Like it doesn't exist on YouTube no one mentions it so for me it is a forgotten but well great flick from Michael Crichton who also wrote a lot of good novels who are based on the good films Jurassic Park Disclosure Congo The Lost World Jurassic Park The 13th Warrior and Timeline.R.I.P. Michael Crichton who died in November 4 2008 and Mako who died in July 21 2006 you two are really missed. I miss this kind off movies they don't make'em like are this one today.

The action takes place at the U.S. headquarters of the Japanese Nakamoto Corporation in L.A. where what first appears to be a straightforward investigation into the death of a young woman becomes complicated by the discovery of a conspiracy a coverup and a political dimension to some negotiations that the corporation is involved in with an American company called MicroCon.

Graham isn't able to wrap the case up immediately and so Special Services liaison officers Lieutenant Web Smith Wesley Snipes and Captain John Connor Sean Connery who have more expertise in communicating with Japanese businessmen are brought in to assist.Smith is a streetwise detective who resents having to team up with his semiretired partner and Connor is an expert on all things Japanese who soon recognises that the circumstances surrounding the death of Cheryl Austin are not as simple as Lieutenant Graham had originally assumed.

	schema:headline " Fix the problem not the blame.";
	schema:reviewBody "Rising Sun is directed by Philip Kaufman who also cowrites with Michael Crichton and Michael Backes with the adaptation coming form Crichton's own novel of the same name. It stars Sean Connery Wesley Snipes Harvey Keitel Ray Wise and CaryHiroyuki Tagawa. Music is by Tru Takemitsu and cinematography by Michael Chapman. Story sees Capt. John Connor Connery and Lt. Webster Web Smith Snipes paired together to try and solve the mystery of a woman murdered at a Japanese high corporation party. With powerful people possibly involved and relations between the American and Japanese people starting to strain Connor and Smith must crack the case sooner rather than later. A tough ask because there's the distinct whiff of a cover up in the air and only a grainy CCTV video as evidence to go on.It was a controversial novel a best seller for sure but Michael Crichton was accused of crafting an antiJapanese diatribe though in some quarters it was heralded as a wake up call that America was losing the business war to Japan. Even though Crichton was brought in to adapt the screenplay it ultimately stands as Kaufman's work because alterations have been made to Crichton's text to balance out as it were the villainycorruption quota between the two opposing cultures. The end result is a film that has no real urgency excitement tension or boldness unless the sexual deviant behaviour of the poor lady murdered counts for the latter that is? Clearly Kaufman and Crichton are not meant to be the former's stylish leanings can't harness the intricate paranoia from Crichton's page which ultimately leaves us with a rather routine murder mystery. Shame because the thirst third is pretty great stuff visually arresting and with characters formed story simmers nicely like it's going to boil over into murky intrigue and cross cultural bitterness. Sadly it doesn't.The director tries to beef things up with some nudity confrontations and a number of shifty characters on the edges of the frame but these only still further bring home just how ponderous the story actually is. There's no raising the pulse for the finale either it may try and come off as an ambiguous tester but ultimately it's lightweight and wasn't worth the wait. Cast wise Connery and Snipes work well together in that father figurestudent way or sempaikohai to be exactly on plotting but the former's gruff beefy charm is diluted and Snipes is given very little to do.

	onyx:emotionText "Rising Sun is directed by Philip Kaufman who also cowrites with Michael Crichton and Michael Backes with the adaptation coming form Crichton's own novel of the same name. It stars Sean Connery Wesley Snipes Harvey Keitel Ray Wise and CaryHiroyuki Tagawa. Music is by Tru Takemitsu and cinematography by Michael Chapman. Story sees Capt. John Connor Connery and Lt. Webster Web Smith Snipes paired together to try and solve the mystery of a woman murdered at a Japanese high corporation party. With powerful people possibly involved and relations between the American and Japanese people starting to strain Connor and Smith must crack the case sooner rather than later. A tough ask because there's the distinct whiff of a cover up in the air and only a grainy CCTV video as evidence to go on.It was a controversial novel a best seller for sure but Michael Crichton was accused of crafting an antiJapanese diatribe though in some quarters it was heralded as a wake up call that America was losing the business war to Japan. Even though Crichton was brought in to adapt the screenplay it ultimately stands as Kaufman's work because alterations have been made to Crichton's text to balance out as it were the villainycorruption quota between the two opposing cultures. The end result is a film that has no real urgency excitement tension or boldness unless the sexual deviant behaviour of the poor lady murdered counts for the latter that is? Clearly Kaufman and Crichton are not meant to be the former's stylish leanings can't harness the intricate paranoia from Crichton's page which ultimately leaves us with a rather routine murder mystery. Shame because the thirst third is pretty great stuff visually arresting and with characters formed story simmers nicely like it's going to boil over into murky intrigue and cross cultural bitterness. Sadly it doesn't.The director tries to beef things up with some nudity confrontations and a number of shifty characters on the edges of the frame but these only still further bring home just how ponderous the story actually is. There's no raising the pulse for the finale either it may try and come off as an ambiguous tester but ultimately it's lightweight and wasn't worth the wait. Cast wise Connery and Snipes work well together in that father figurestudent way or sempaikohai to be exactly on plotting but the former's gruff beefy charm is diluted and Snipes is given very little to do. Keitel turns in an interesting one as does Ray Wise but even these portrayals tend to shine only because what's around them is borderline dull. It does look nice though where a very modernist sheen plays host to some shifty shenanigans. Perhaps it really is a simple case of too much compromise going on in here?

The movie starts out with an Asian man in karaoke bar singing while a female who is apparently his girlfriend is really not all that into it. Well said female ends up dead and all signs point to the boyfriend however all is not what it appears to be as there are some technological aspects to the crime and it is hard to get information in this world as an investigator must try to get answers and must turn to an expert on this sort of corporate Japanese culture to find the answers behind the crime. The film is good thanks to the interplay between Snipes and Connery there is not really a whole lot of action in this movie so it is good that they do such a good job with their roles. There is some sexuality present though in the movie and that makes for an entertaining scene in this one here and there too. It is also always nice to have a movie about another culture even when that culture is contained within the United States as it is here. There could have been more action and at times the movie gets a bit to overly complicated in presenting itself and the end is rather confusing too but in the end it has Connery and Snipes and both of them rise this movie up a peg or two.".

Peck and Jarman do a terrific job in portraying father and son. Many of the scenes are carried by their performances especially close to the end. The scene where Peck is caught modeling one of his wife's dresses speaks to the entire film. The coming of age element with Jarman slowly becoming a man and Peck trying to teach his son what he needs to know to become that man is present. Some of the movie is comical and touching but overall the message of the story is the love traded by father and son. You have to see this movie at least once. If you are a fan you have no choice but to see it again.".

But then four years later MGM decided to start again with Gregory Peck as the kindly father Jane Wyman as his embittered wife and Claude Jarman Jr. as the naive Jody whose love for a pet fawn is the centerpiece of the story. It was worth the wait. They are all well cast in this tender warmhearted story from the Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings novel of a family living near the Florida everglades.The technicolor photography is as impressive as the use of background music especially in the scene where Jody playfully comes across the abandoned fawn. Jarman's emotions and the soaring score combine to make one of the film's strongest and most appealing moments. Jane Wyman was so convincing as the hardened mother afraid of losing her only child that when she took her daughter to see the film she wouldn't speak to her for two weeks afterwardsunable to forgive her mother for the final action she takes in the film!Ideal family entertainment and a mustsee for anyone who has missed seeing this film classic. Claude Jarman Jr. deserved his Academy Award and although he had never acted before was chosen from 19000 applicants to play Jody. Peck plays the father with dignity and restraint his love for the boy apparent in every frame of the film. An unforgettable coming of age tale tastefully produced and faithful to the original source.".

	schema:reviewBody "This wonderful film is one of a handful that has the power to call me back to my childhood days and wrap me in warm memories of my Mom Dad and little brother sitting around the television on Saturday night watching the late show. From the opening scenes of this beautifully photographed movie I found myself caughtup in the intriguing post Civil War story of a boy and his pet faun and their fantastic adventures on a scruffy Florida Everglades farm. The film stars Gregory Peck Jane Wyman and Claude Jarman in the lead roles with some of Hollywood's best character actors in the supporting roles.Peck gives an Oscar caliber performance as the warmhearted father who does his best to make a better life for his family with absolutely no help from the elements which surround them. Jane Wyman brilliantly plays Orry the hardened mother and wife who is so embittered by past tragedies in her life that she is unable to show any love for her one surviving child for fear of losing him as well. And Claude Jarman plays Jodie the wistful young boy who is just one summer away from adolescence and all the emotional growing pains that come with it. This story is laced with excitement and adventure sure to please the kids but each of the adventures is also a great lesson in life that will stay with them for years to come. The cinematography is spectacular and received a welldeserved Academy Award and the wildlife scenes are incredible as well. Just watching Jodie romp through the woods with his faun is a joyous site to behold. The way Orry finally begins letting herself love her son will bring tears to your eyes. This movie was one of the most emotional experiences of my young life and I believe I am a better person from the lessons learned here.I highly recommend this film it is one to be experienced with your entire family.".

Jodie having to shoot the deer at the end and the dream sequence of him running afterwards. . .well as a child it left me devastated. And I will confess I had the same response again as an adult. Call me overly sensitive but The Yearling was just emotionally overwhelming and always will be for me.I think the acting is superb Gregory Peck giving one of his two incredible performances as a loving father the other one of course in To Kill a Mockingbird. If ever there is a film role model for fathers today it can be found in these two films. Peck's love for his son his desire to protect his world and let him be a boy for just a little bit longer is beautifully portrayed.Whenever this film is shown on television I will indeed watch the beginning up to when Flag is found but then I do turn the channel before the end. My daughter is nearly twelve now and I see the transition in her from child to adult and the film has influenced me as a loving father to hope she enjoys that childhood as long as possible before having to let go of it. And yes we've seen the first half of the film together we both get a teary eyed and then switch to something else.I adore the soundtrack based on the work of Delius and highly recommend his Florida Suite.The cinematography award is well deserved stunningly beautiful again with a dream like quality to it.As to some of the critics. Please. . .you have no concept of life in 19th century Florida after the Civil War. It was hard scrabble and if a man was disabled his family literally could starve thus forcing Jodie to face his terrible decision regarding his pet. Our politically correct sensibilities of today had very little room in the 1870s and yes this statement is from an animal lover but also an historian of the period. I'm almost amused by the critics who casually say build a barn or make a bigger fence. . .try it some time using the tools of the period in the climate and ecosystem of Florida. I think the scenes where Jodie and his Ma do attempt that in order to save Flag are heart breaking and realistically portrayed.So if you haven't seen this one do so but even you tough guys you better have a box of tissues handy. A warning though if you have children who are sensitive to animals think twice or preview it first it can be very traumatic.".

There are difficult lessons.  Peck is forced to shoot a doe in order to save his own life.  He is a man in love with his child's growth process  not forgetting what being a child is like yet knowing that harsh lessons are necessary. Jane Wyman plays a wife who has hardened herself against being hurt by turning hard.  Who can forget the scene showing the row of headstones. Claude Jarman is perfect as the yearling adolescent.  His performance was so wonderful in this film that I think it is one ofthe reasons his career never reached superstar.  He is able to depict the coltish behavior of the adolescent male perfectly. This movie remains a classic because the dialogue the acting and the scenery all come together perfectly.  Sometimes an actor becomes a star and then all one sees in the movie is the star's personality.  This movie catches both Gregory Peck and Jane Wyman without their superstar persona. They are immersed in the roles it's impossible to imagine any other performers in the roles and it's one of the reasons the remake simply didn't do well.".

It's about that horrible mutation every adult has gone through from one who for example can only see a boy and his deer story in this movie into one who mourns for the time when that's all heshe could see.I can't imagine the parent whose guts wouldn't be wrenched out by Pa's words to Jody at the end followed by Jody's dream of the two things he's forever lost.The central themes of this movie are well over any child's head but at the same time The Yearling is rich with stuff that's engaging and perfect for viewers of all ages.  It's a beautifully made movie.".

Ouch that's sad.Much sadder as an adult watching this movie is the realization that The Yearling is about the death of childhood.  It's about that horrible mutation every adult has gone through from one who for example can only see a boy and his deer story in this movie into one who mourns for the time when that's all heshe could see.I can't imagine the parent whose guts wouldn't be wrenched out by Pa's words to Jody at the end followed by Jody's dream of the two things he's forever lost.The central themes of this movie are well over any child's head but at the same time The Yearling is rich with stuff that's engaging and perfect for viewers of all ages.  It's a beautifully made movie.";

I get that Jane Wyman is playing the part of the mother as cold and hard because all of her other children have died and she doesn't want to get too attached to this one. But she goes too far in my opinion. Any kid raised this way will have no attachment to mom whatsoever when he reaches adulthood. It is said that Gregory Peck is supposed to be making up for mom's coldness by being close to son Jody. But why doesn't he call him by name? Why does he weirdly keep calling him Boy. Have I accidentally wandered into a Tarzan film? And then into this sweet boy Jody's dismal life comes a pet  a fawn. But all does not stay well. The yearling becomes destructive to the crops and must be killed and what's worse is that Jody is made to finish the job! His best friend Fodderwing a cripple dies as a child. So everyone Jody is really attached to is dead. He is gone three days after the fawn's killing and then dad acts puzzled and even somewhat indifferent when he returns? As for mom she hardly looks away from her housework to notice Jody's return. At least if mom dies embalming will not be an issue  if they had that at the time  because ice water does not coagulate.For those of you who say this is a classic I agree only from a standpoint of it being finely crafted and timeless. For those of you who said it warms your heart see your doctor immediately. The only explanation can be a coronary.If you want to see a tale of how hard life can be that did warm my heart try to track down a copy of Mrs. Mike with Dick Powell as a Mountie trying to get his wife who comes from a civilized place accustomed to the death disease and starvation that accompanies life in the great white north. That one DID warm my heart.I know this review will not be popular but it is how I see it.

When watching this film I couldn't help but think of the others. And no not just because of the fact the plot involves a family and the emotional fallout and drama caused by a pet such as in Old Yeller or the fact that Jane Wyman stars with an adorable child actor such as she did in Pollyanna. It's the feel and the atmosphere that invoked these comparisons. However where The Yearling is on a pedestal all its own is in regards to the fine performances. No The Yearling is not my kind of film. I tend to avoid the saccharine and goopy syrup of movies like this. You know the old adage Never make a movie with kids or animals? Well mine is Never watch a movie with kids or animals. But this one sucked me in. I don't quite know what did it. But I got sucked in and couldn't get out. The performances make this movie.Claude Jarman Jr. stars as Jody Baxter a young boy living in postCivil War America who longs for the companionship and love of a pet  someone to take care of and nurture. While Jody's loving father EzraGregory Peckmakes great strides to give Jody companionship and someone to look up to Jody suffers from the neglect of his hardened mother OrryWyman still reeling from the untimely deaths of her other children. Jody befriends a fawn and takes it in as his own. The two bond and love each other. But what happens when the young deer begins to eat the crops that the family live off of? Only tragedy can ensue.The Yearling is a delicately handled film that encapsulates the best of 1800's living. And while this is deemed a family film there are some surprisingly difficult scenes and subplots that might be scary to some children. I know I was uncomfortable watching the animal fight scenes and the death of one of Jody's close friends. And even though this has got to be one of the most predictable movies the performances we get from Wyman Peck and especially Jarman are stellar. In the movie's final emotional scenes no one has been so convincing as Jarman in conveying heartache and mindnumbing trauma. And Wyman while on the sidelines is incredible as a woman afraid to open up and terrified to lose her one remaining child. On top of that the cinematography is firstrate with some stunning sunset shots and silhouettes set against the backdrop of rural America. And despite some offkilter bits at the end revolving around Jody getting lost on the river and being found by a ship The Yearling is a solid and heartwarming film that has earned its place among the top Hollywood classics.".

Great casting and interesting characters including the late veteran Scottish actor Ian Bannen as Billy. Beautifully filmed on location in south Wales I loved Billy's house. Although sadly this was Ian Bannen's final film it was the first film performance for a very talented native Welsh lad John Paul Macleod who gives an outstanding portrayal of the main character Taliesin Jones. This young actor will make you care about Taliesin.  There is drama mixed with some light humor and I'm pleased to say no major violence. This film which has a timeless message  is a little different than the usual Hollywood millstream of movies and pleasantly so.

This is one of the most successful liveaction fairy tale films. The entire production is rich in color and atmosphere. The effective use of unusual locations and cinematography puts this film in a one of a kind category. The screenplays for the fantasy section are very fine and the biographical story is simple but unpretentious and easy to take. What really makes this sprawling fairy tale work is the wonderful cast and acting. This is an enormous international cast and includes humorous and touching performances from many of film's finest character actors.

	schema:reviewBody "Back when it first was out I never did get around to seeing The Wonderful World of The Brothers Grimm and it should be seen in the theater rather than a formatted VHS version. This was indeed a film for which Cinerama was definitely suited.During the Fifties a whole lot of the Grimm stories were used in a shortlived series hosted by the grown up Shirley Temple entitled Shirley Temple's storybook. I think they were better presented on the big screen. I'm not sure if these in fact are the real Wilhelm and Jacob Grimm as played by Laurence Harvey and Karl Boehm. Wilhelm is the married one in fact married to the lovely Claire Bloom with two small children and it's those kids who keep him interested in German folklore and tales of such. The more serious minded Jacob scholar historian and linguist would like to marry Barbara Eden but that ain't happening unless the brothers finish the dynastic history they've been commissioned to write by Duke Oscar Homolka. And Jacob can't keep Wilhelm's mind on the business at hand.The real story of the brothers is merely a plot device on which to hang cinematic presentation of three of the Grimm fairy tales and the presence of a lot of the others during a delirious fever sustained by Laurence Harvey. The regular story is directed by Henry Levin but George Pal who probably got the biggest budget in his career to utilize in The Wonderful World of The Brothers Grimm gets to direct the fairy tale segments.My favorite is The Singing Bone with TerryThomas as the braggadocious knight and Buddy Hackett as his put upon squire and their encounter with a dragon in a cave. That is George Pal and Cinerama at their very best.Don't expect a whole lot from this film it's not deep it was meant for the kid market. And it dates not a bit though with today's computer generated special effects it would be even better if done today.".

The movie can be seen as 4 in one. It features 3 told fairy tales and then there is the storyline regarding the brothers Grimm themselves. The whole story of the brother Grimm is perhaps not the most interesting told one especially not for children and its not as wonderful and fairytale like as the actual fairy tales told in this movie. And the brothers Grimm have written some of the most marvelous and best known fairy tales but yet this movie decides to use some lesser known and less great fairy tales 'The Dancing Princess' 'The Cobbler and the Elves' and 'The Singing Bone'. In my opinion it makes the movie a bit of a missed opportunity. It's not a bad movie now but the whole movie gave the feeling it all could had been more entertaining humorous filled and a bit shorter. The movie had easily could and also should had ended 15 minutes earlier. The movie now needlessly goes on for too long.The fairy tales are definitely the best told parts of the movie. They flow well have a fun feeling and atmosphere all over it and all makes you forget your worries for a while. It's kept all perfectly childish and it ensures that it never ever becomes too scary for the young ones.The movie is filled with some wonderful and lovable characters and they're being played by some good actors. Laurence Harvey and Karlheinz Bhm aren't really believable as brothers mostly because of their looks and very different accent of course but they're still of course good actors. Some supporting roles are there for TerryThomas Buddy Hackett and Billy Barty among others.The movie was made filmed in 3camera Cinerama. Cinerama is the trademarked name for a widescreen process which works by simultaneously projecting images from three synchronized 35 mm projectors onto a huge deeplycurved screen. So a technique that works only in cinemas. On the small screen it just doesn't look good and it looks like the images on screen are cut in 3 parts but back then movies just weren't made for home release of course. The movie is good looking. Deliberately campy with its fairytale sequences and good and realistic in its 'real world' sequences. The sets are all nice Oscarnom and so are the costumes Oscarwin. The stopmotion effects in the movie are all fair looking but it's nothing too impressive really. Wasn't Ray Harryhausen available for this movie?Good entertainment for the whole family.710httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Considering the lack of attention given to this film by both MGM and Cinerama I was glad to find an Italian DVD release. Both my computer and DVD player are zonefree so I had no reason not to buy it for living outside of Europe the more so since until today July 10 2015 there has been no release of a restored version. To my surprise the Italian release had an acceptable image quality. One has to admit though that beyond the complaint for the division lines of the Cinerama projection the full experience of inventor Fred Waller's system opposed to Abel Gance's Polyvision could only be achieved in a cinema with curved screen. On a flat screen no matter if the motion picture has been smileboxed or not the image is always slightly distorted. So if you had never seen it be warned of the distortion the lines dividing the three panels and the lack of restoration. For me it was as good as in 1962 and I enjoyed it again very much. I did not know there are many persons who think this is a better film than How the West Was Won it is probably right there is no propaganda here no patriotic hymns and the script is tighter instead of the story of three generations in HTWWW Karl Malden's Debbie Reynolds' and George Peppard's in TWWOTBG you only have the story of the two Grimm brothers with three of their fairy tales inserted along the biography. If you expect CGIs instead of George Pal's animation see another movie and if not enjoy his puppets and dragon. The cast on the other hand includes various cult players as Beulah Bondi TerryThomas Martita Hunt Ian Wolfe and Oscar Homolka popular comedians as Jim Backus Buddy Hackett and Arnold Stang young stars of the 60s as Yvette Mimieux Robert Crawford Jr. and Russ Tamblyn and good lead players Laurence Harvey Karlheinz Bhm Claire Bloom Barbara Eden and Walter Slezak.

	onyx:emotionText "Considering the lack of attention given to this film by both MGM and Cinerama I was glad to find an Italian DVD release. Both my computer and DVD player are zonefree so I had no reason not to buy it for living outside of Europe the more so since until today July 10 2015 there has been no release of a restored version. To my surprise the Italian release had an acceptable image quality. One has to admit though that beyond the complaint for the division lines of the Cinerama projection the full experience of inventor Fred Waller's system opposed to Abel Gance's Polyvision could only be achieved in a cinema with curved screen. On a flat screen no matter if the motion picture has been smileboxed or not the image is always slightly distorted.

The librarian gave me a look that said Aren't you a little old for this movie?.Having watched it now I am impressed by the extensive use of wonderful German locations including Neuschwanstein Castle Rothenburg and so on. The stop motion animation is a bit cheesy but in many ways is really very well choreographed...live actors move convincingly around the animated characters. I also wonder what technique was used for the magic cloak of invisibility in the first segment it looks pretty good.It seems that only the panandscan version is available on video at this time and the version I saw had a noticeable pair of vertical lines on either side of the image I had not realized that the original film was in Cinerama with it's three screen projection  I suppose that those lines are the places where the outer two images merge with the center image. I wonder if they were as visible when viewed on the big screen? Still there are many good things about this movie and if one were to edit out just the fairy tale segments to another video it would be worthwhile for kids.".

The story is about the early days of The Brothers Grimm and how they got inspiration to wright so many wonderful stories.Laurence Harvey gives a good sensitive performance as the brother Willhelm who was more of the dreamer of the two and who almost gives up when he becomes ill during the latter part of the film only to get better when his invented characters come to him in dream form and urge him to get better and continue to wrightwhich he eventually does. Also in the film are three separate fairy tales my favourite being the first one The Dancing Princess which contains a lovely dance routine between Russ Tamblyn and Yvette Mimuex Mr Tamblyn is full of charm and shows off his clever gymnastic skills in a story which is also humorous and has some clever special effects such as the invisible cloak.The Singing Bone starring Terry Thomas is also very humorous although the dragon doesn't look scary in the leastbut then this was probably intentional as the story is made for children. The three stories are all very colourful and not overlong and would suit a young child's attention span.This is definitely a film that can be enjoyed by all agesI've often heard that this film was so much better on the big screenthat i can well believe although i think the TCM version is good ma by not as good but it will do. I along with a lot of other people am wondering when they are going to release this on DVDas i wouldn't mind a copy.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I was eight years old this film was rereleased with  of all things  How The West Was Won! At the time HTWWW was my favorite movie but I remembered adoring Wonderful World of The Brothers Grimm when I saw it as a second feature. I must have had a cast iron keister because the nearly six hour playing time of the two movies never bothered me and I remember going to see it more than once during that release.Over the years this film has stayed with me  especially the fairytale segments. I remembered that I adored the sets and costumes loved the dance numbers and thought the movie was enchanting. How The West Was Won went to TV soon after this release but WWOTBG never did at least not in my area. In fact I have often thought about this film but was never able to indulge myself in the nostalgia of reviewing it  until recently.TCM finally played it over the holidays last year and I recorded it on DVR due to a busy life I am only now getting down to watching it again. All I can say is my how tastes change with age! The costumes and sets are still lovely and the music score is pretty good. I was especially moved this time by the Christmas song in the Cobbler And The Elves segment as well as the Gypsy music in the Dancing Princess. When I saw the film in theaters it was not in Cinerama format. TCM showed it in a letterbox version so the entire picture is represented but the film has a distorted appearance which is sometimes difficult to watch. The movie boasts an excellent cast but the directing is uneven the plot is slow and the special effects are fine for the era in which this movie was made but might bore younger viewers who are used to more sophisticated technology.I started watching the film yesterday but I'm finding it so laborious that I am having to watch it in segments I want to finish it to see what it is about this flick that my 8yearold self found intriguing. The fairytale segments are still fun but the biopic portion is downright boring. Some if the historical inaccuracies are glaring  I think at one point our heroes take a steam boat to visit a church in another city but steam boats weren't around during the Napoleonic era. Neuschwanstein Castle was built in the 1870's. The romance between Barbara Eden and Wilhelm Grimm is downright cringeworthy.I am sure if I could see this in a theater and in Cinerama my opinion might be altered but on a TV screen this film can't hold my interest. This makes me sad because I have fond memories of this film but for me it does not stand the test of time. Kids may like it but it might be a bit long and slow for today's youngsters who are used to lots of flash explosions and action.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm 1962 was the seventh of the eight films made in the Cinerama process and the first to be released since the last of the travelogues in 1958 a gap of four years.The travelogue motif had been used up there were no more places in the world to visit worthy of a two hour running time. So MGM took a chance and set up the process for two allstar narrative films one released in 1962 Grimm the other How The West Was Won the following year in 1963.As backup MGM filmed Mutiny On The Bounty in a competitive process Ultra Panavision 70 a single strip process that was comparable in height and width to Cinerama but lacking the overlapping seam problems and curved screen effects of the latter. Mutiny was released in 1962 the same year as Grimm. Eventually MGM and the industry went with the Panavision process due to a number of advantages. It was less bulky way less costly theaters could more easily adapt to a single projector replacement than an elaborate three projector system that also required a specific curved screen to be installed. Most importantly closeups and medium shots could return to the screen and actors could communicate facially with each other again the Cinerama curved screen required actors to look up and to one side of the camera to be seen in the theater as looking at the audience andor fellow actors.Grimm is a minor film endearing and charming but of no great importance. The performances all seem either wooden or theatrically exaggerated. One exception is Laurence Harvey giving one of his most sympathetic and warmest interpretations as Wilhelm Grimm. He also gives a wonderful character performance as The Cobbler in The Cobbler and the Elves sequence. Special note is to be taken of Jim Backus hilarious as the King in The Dancing Princess episode TerryThomas equally amusing as the evil knight in The Singing Bone episode and the charming dancing of Russ Tamblyn and Yvette Mimieux in The Dancing Princess.The score is charming with a jaunty main theme and a catchy up beat number Ah Oom! for the elves to sing while making shoes.While the invisibility special effects The Dancing Princess are expertly done the George Pal Puppetoon stop action effects for the elves in The Cobbler and the Elves and the dragon in The Singing Bone are dreadfully out of date and amateurish. Once we had digital visual effects in Jurassic Park all the old stop action dinosaur films were antiquated and such is the effect here. As such these sequences will seem uninteresting to modern children after the age of seven or eight thus limiting the appeal to a modern audience.There is only one thrill sequence for the Cinerama cameras with a speeding coach towards the end of The Dancing Princess sequence. The opening scenes of Napoleonic battle seem to be an homage to Abel Gance whose 1926 Napoleon used a three camera projection process for the final battle montage.The film has never been released on DVD in this country. As of this writing it is the only one of the Cinerama eight that has not. An old VHS manufacture was a scan and pan full screen version. Today your only chance to see this in its wide screen composition is a TCM broadcast. That print is fuzzy and the colors are washed out. This is badly in need of a digital clean up and restoration if it is to be released on DVD eventually.All in all this is a charming film for parents with children up to the ages of eight years old. However its lasting value is as an antique and as a Cinerama production.Although officially given a 135 minute running time with Overture and Intermission music the full print times out at 2 hours 21 minutes 25 seconds.It received four Oscar nominations Cinematography Art Direction Costumes and Score and won the Oscar for Costumes.Russ Tamblyn has the distinction of appearing in both MGM Cinerama films the only actor in the MGM roster to have done so.".

	schema:headline " Perhaps it was better in all its Cinerama glory though it's hard to imagine";
	schema:reviewBody "Codirected by Henry Levin and producer George Pal this average biographical fantasy won an Oscar for Best Costume Design and was nominated for Color Art DirectionSet Decoration and Cinematography and Score. The film was made using the three projector Cinerama process which loses something in the translation to a television set even in letterbox format. One can clearly see the seams between the three screens in most shots and even some tinting differences in a few scenes The Singing Bone sequence being the most obvious.

Though it must have been something to see in the theater the effects used give the audience a ride or a sense of motion most notably in The Dancing Princess sequence these scenes fall flat without a 25 foot radius rounded screen.As for the film's story the biography is centered around the brothers Grimm the big kid family man Wilhelm Laurence Harvey and the more serious bachelor Jacob Karlheinz Bhm. While both are working on an historical account of the local Duke's Oscar Homolka his manservant Gruber is played by Ian Wolfe family history Wilhelm keeps trying to convince his brother that they should be capturing children's stories they hear for future generations before they're lost forever.

During the course of this backdrop story Wilhelm tells to children such as his own or hears from an old woman played by Martita Hunt of these fairy talesThe Dancing Princess story is about a King Jim Backus that wants to know what his daughter Yvette Mimieux is doing every night to wear out her shoes. He can't find out because she's been drugging the men who've been promised her hand in marriage if they can before she goes out. Enter the Woodsman Russ Tamblyn who's been given a special invisibility cloak by the Gypsy Beulah Bondi. Naturally given Tamblyn's talents the Princess has been sneaking out to dance the night away with other gypsies. Utilizing the cloak the Woodsman is able to follow her then appear  dance his way into her heart wearing a mask and ultimately win the Princess per the King's promise and maskless even her approval.The Cobbler also played by Harvey in makeup that makes him look like Pinocchio's Geppetto and the Elves story is a touching one about the harried craftsman who's working to complete toy elves for the poor children across the street in time for Christmas. This necessitates neglecting his regular work and jeopardizes his chances of finishing the shoes of several impatient customers Walter Brooke Sandra Gale Bettin and Robert Foulk in time for the Prime Minister's Clinton Sundberg party. However when he goes to sleep on Christmas Eve the elves come to life and finish the shoes for him. David Pal's special effects are above average.The Singing Bone story includes a fire breathing dragon that so terrorizes his country that the King Otto Kruger promises to give half of his kingdom to the person that slays it. Bumbling knight Ludwig TerryThomas and his illtreated yet resourceful humble servant Hans Buddy Hackett set about to do just that where others have failed. Long scenes sporting inferior dragon special effects finally produce the predicted results the dragon is killed but with an unexpected outcome Hans did it. But before they return to the King with the dragon's head Ludwig kills Hans to ensure credit for himself. However a year later a shepherd Robert Crawford Jr. finds a bone on Hans's grave which tells the truth of what happened. Sydney Smith narrates.

Talk about a movie holding up over 70 years. To my mind it's the Citizen Kane of comedy. Everything about it is pitch perfect. To watch the boys as they sink deeper and deeper into absurdity in explaining their arrival back ahead of the rescue ship is a marvel to watch. There are so many subtle nonsensical and memorable moments that stay in the mind years later one almost doesn't know where to start. The solemn dark lighting of the opening scene spoofing fraternal organizations eating the wax fruit the range of facial expressions of the wives throughout the shot of the boys from the back sitting facing the fireplace as Stan disses his wife Stan's wife in hunting regalia returning shotgun in arm carrying ducks Ollie flirting on the phone not realizing it's his wife he's talking to the stream of consciousness dialog in the attic and on and on and on. A subtlety perhaps missed by many is the wonderful song and dance number at the night club....a simply wonderful lampoon to perfection of crooner Dick Powell and spoof of Busby Berkeley with those clunky but charming Hula dancers struggling in a valiant but ultimately hopeless attempt to dance fanning out to the camera and culminating in that marvelous overhead shot near the close. Just great. I could write a book on this movie but I'll just suggest to viewers to get William K. Everson's book on the films of Laurel  Hardy and read what one of the great critics has to say about this gem.".

Hardy does his normal routine too with the dirty looks the scheming and the pratfalls.The women are the bosses and Hardy's wife is the toughest of the two throwing plates at Olllie's head! These are tough old bags. Oddly enough on the second viewing of this film I found a bit slow going which I didn't find the first time. Charley Chase a famous silent comedian is also in the film as are a few things you wouldn't associate with Laurel  Hardy some sexual stuff! Really! There is a dance number in the middle of the film where I swear I saw a seethrough blouse on the main dancer. Also there was a play onwords here about some woman who likes to pump the organ. Well this film was made a year or so before the Hays' Code went into effect.At any rate if you have never seen the famous duo this is a good place to start.".

No such chemistry has existed between two entertainers before or since. Mel Brooks said it best Dying is easy. Comedy that's difficult.This time around the boys attempt to slip away from their domineering wives Only Stan would choose a mate that was one of the best duck hunters around and thus a crack shot with a gun to attend a convention of the illustrious Sons of the Desert in Chicago to hear the exhausted ruler speak as Stan calls him. Oliver feigns illness getting Stan to bring a fake doctor to advise a sea cruise to Honululu. Only Stan could make opening a door to exit a room excruciatingly funny. As usual Stan bungles it all and gets a Veternerian instead who just happens to bring his dogs along on the house call. The ruse works after a few hilarious scenes involved Oliver and the tub of hot water in which his feet are soaking. The boys ultimately end up in Chicago.

Chase was more than a match for the two and their scenes together represent the apex of their careers.Stan and Ollie were not just gifted visual comics their repartee with each other was exemplary. The lines though supposedly written by others would not have the same humorous effect if spoken by anyone else. I'm sure much of the dialog was added to or adlibbed by the team. Stan tries to rationalize the situation Well if she didn't go to the mountains then Mohammad would have to come here. Ollie jumps right in What has Mohammad got to do with my wife? To read more of the brilliant lines note IMDb's quotes taken from Sons of the Desert.If you enjoy Sons of the Desert by all means watch Way Out West. The two represent Laurel and Hardy at their best.

This movie has it all and therefor this movie can truly be regarded as perhaps the most definite Laurel  Hardy picture around.The movie has a classic comedy story. It's very simple and it has been used in many different other variations before and after this movie but it's extremely effective. It's another fine mess the boys get themselves into after they secretly go to a convention of the 'sons of the desert' in Chicago after fooling their wives by telling them that they are going to Honolulu to 'cure' Oliver's faked illness. However when the steamliner the boys were supposed to be on sinks the boys can't go home without letting their wives know were they truly had been. In between they also get themselves into some silly humorous trouble which this time also involves fellow comedian Charley Chase who was the brother of regular Laurel  Hardy picture director James Parrott.This is not necessarily the movie with the best or most Laurel  Hardy jokes or slapstick moments in it but it's the whole package of the movie that makes this one such a great and enjoyable one that deserves a position among the greatest comedies of all time. It combines all of the best elements out of Laurel  Hardy movies and the end result is an hilarious easy and pleasant to watch movie from start till finish that never loses any of its power.The trouble the boys get themselves into is of course silly and therefor also extremely fun at the same time. It's the sort of simple light hearted comedy we unfortunately see so little anymore in movies these days. All of the silly moments are very well build up and executed in the movie and timed. It also is of course thanks to the talent of Oliver Hardy and Stanley Laurel that all the moments work out so well and effective in a comical way. They make the simple story work out way more effective than you could ever anticipate. The movie is also helped by some well written comical dialog. This movie perhaps has the most dialog gags out of all the Laurel  Hardy pictures that are still around. Even the slower moments of the movie never get boring thanks to the energetic comedy acting from Stanley Laurel and Oliver Hardy. Laurel  Hardy regular Mae Busch also shows up again as Mrs. Hardy. Busch is always a pleasure to watch in any Laurel  Hardy movie and was a real great comedy talent.All in all this might very well be the best and most definitive Laurel  Hardy picture ever made that deserved to be ranked among other comedy classics.1010httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

Seiter starring the comedy team of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy is not a foreign legion story set in the Sahara desert as the title might imply but a domestic comedy with Sons of the Desert the name of a fraternity lodge brothers organization where Stan and Ollie are members Oasis 13 Los Angeles California.As the story goes Stan and Ollie Laurel and Hardy best friends two peas in a pod and next door neighbors both married with their front doors reading Mr. and Mrs. Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy and Wife are introduced as late arrivals to the Sons of the Desert fraternity meeting where the exhausted ruler announces the club's 87th annual convention to take place in Chicago where all members are expected to attend. After the swearingin ceremony and singing of We Are the Sons of the Desert guiltridden Stanley tells Ollie he's afraid to ask his wife Betty if he could go. Oliver strongwilled on the outside fearfully henpecked on the inside insists Stanley let Betty know that he's king of his castle. Easier said than done considering Mrs. Laurel Dorothy Christie is an avid duck hunter who never misses her target with her rifle. As for Oliver's spouse Lottie Mae Busch whom he affectionately calls sugar she's caring to her husband's needs but at the same time is quicktempered and domineering. After learning about the convention she makes it clear to Oliver that she has her heart set on going to the mountains and is not permitted to attend. Since Betty has granted Stanley permission to go Oliver comes up with a scheme pretending to have a nervous breakdown and with Stanley's help hires an animal doctor Horace Merrick Lucien Littlefield to make a house call examine Ollie like a dog and suggest an ocean voyage rest cure to Honolulu. Since Lottie doesn't like the ocean and claims to be a poor sailor it is suggested Stan accompany him. The plan works and the boys go to the convention having the time of their lives. They even get to meet up with a loudmouth club member named Charlie Chase who turns out to be Mrs. Hardy's longlost brother. On the very day the boys are to return home the wives receive news that the Honolulu steamship has sunk. Unable to acquire the names of the survivors the girls wait it out by attending a picture show at a local theater. While there they watch a newsreel presentation of the Sons of the Desert convention with Stan and Ollie in full view marching in the parade mugging their faces into the camera. How will the boys be able to explain this now that the wives are fully aware they've been tricked? With this being a favorite among Laurel and Hardy devotees it seems natural the film's title be adopted for the Laurel and Hardy fan club. Movies such as this were probably an inspiration to future TV shows particularly The Honeymooners starring Jackie Gleason fat and Art Carney skinny as Laurel and Hardy counterparts. With numerous battle of the sexes comedies featuring henpecked husbands being common place either in short subjects or feature length films even when knowing how this will all turn out viewers familiar with this formula will still want to see the results and find out whether the boys will fess up to the truth or face the consequences from their wives. As with Gleason and Carney caricatures in The Honeymooners the overweight is over confident full of ideas that backfires on him and married to a woman who's one step ahead of him while Laurel the thin one with a cry of a child is weak yet sensible and highly influenced by his friend married to a loving spouse who knows the wrong he does is not of his own choosing. While deceiving and lying are never solutions to anything Stan sums it up best with his own philosophy Honesty is the best politics. The current success of SONS OF THE DESERT relies on its fine script witty dialogue and clever gags sometimes violent thrown in. Mae Busch as Hardy's wife is as fine casting as Kathleen Howard is for W.C. Fields in three notable films. Busch's Lottie has a vicious laugh HA! added to her hot temper leading to the result of smashing a vase over her husband's head and everything else that goes with it. While spouse abuse doesn't wear well with today's society as comedy this was common practice with the Laurel and Hardy formula. Dorothy Christy as Mrs. Laurel is charming but makes herself clear at one point with her stern sounding voice in telling Lottie Stanley would never lie to me. I'd hate to think of what might happen if he everr DID! With many classic scenes too numerous to mention the film does take time for a brief musical number Honolulu Baby sung by a male vocalist with overhead camera shot of dancing Hawaiian girls doing formations in the Busby Berkeley tradition.Distributed on video cassette from various companies during the early days of home video 1980s SONS OF THE DESERT played on various cable networks throughout the years The Comedy Channel late 1980s  American Movie Classics 199496 and finally Turner Classic Movies where it premiered April 1st 2005. It continues to be a perennial favorite Laurel and Hardy film. In spite of its age the film still holds up today and at 67 minutes plays like an extended comedy short.

It doesn't make rational sense if the idea is that they're ignoring their wives. But I suppose in their world they just hated that Sons Of The Desert Lodge so much that even a vacation in Hawaii with just Stan and Ollie is preferable. And the fact that Ollie preferred Stan's company to Mrs. Hardy says volumes in and of itself.So the boys decide to say they were going to Hawaii but two things happen. The ocean liner sinks that was supposed to take Stan and Ollie to Hawaii and the wives are in a panic. But not for long as the wives decide to kill time at a movie and happen to spot their husbands hamming it up for a newsreel cameraman who was covering the Sons Of The Desert convention. What happens afterward is sheer laugh bliss.Best series of gags involve Stan Ollie and Mae Busch with a tub full of water as Ollie is trying to pretend he's ill. They all get wet every which way imaginable. Next best series of gags is the boys in joint attic of their two homes trying to get some sleep and hide from the wives who come home unexpectedly. Let's just say they're both in for a lot more water on that cold and rainy night.Fellow Hal Roach comedian Charley Chase pops up at the convention scenes as a particularly obnoxious reveling conventioneer. And Lucian Littlefield plays a veterinarian who is called as Stan is blissfully unaware of his specialty. When Ollie asks why Stan called a veterinarian Stan innocently replies that he didn't think the man's religion should have any bearing. A great line and Laurel is so preciously innocent delivering it but I would have expected a gag like that to have been in an AbbottCostello film.Gags and lines are flawlessly executed in Sons Of The Desert.

After a phone conversation with Stan he agreed to my visit. Living at the Oceana Hotel in Santa Monica he had sustained a stroke sometime before but could still get around fairly well and was a very alert intelligent man so different from his onscreen persona. I wish I could remember more of our conversation but it was 45 years ago and memory fades. The LH films were popular on TV at the time and Stan regretfully stated that he got no residuals for their showing which was unfortunate. He also hated L.A. driving and referred in particular to the bloody freeways. Questioned about their movie clothes derbiessuits ties etc. he said that after Hardy died he gave them all away to the Salvation Army. I also asked him about one of my favorite movie villains and a regular in LH films Walter Long which you regular LH fans may remember. This guy's consummate portrayal of a vicious lout and bully was apparently nothing like his real offscreen personality. Stan said he was the mildest gentlest man imaginable. He was quite touched as I mentioned the two's onscreen foil in a number of films silent and sound James Finlayson who was deceased. He was very close to the canny Scot. Anyhow with a photo of Stan and Ollie autographed by Stan in my hands I regretfully took my leave.Stan was one of the two originators of the LH fan club The Sons of the Desert which at one time had tents all over the U.S. and also in Europe. The club's motto Stan's brainstorm was Two Minds Without A Single Thought. As a member of the Orange County Calif. tent I enjoyed the films shown and guest personalities at the meetings some 30 years ago. Three guests that I do recall were Darla Hood from Our Gang comedies Roy Searight special effects wizard who in addition to working on Laurel and Hardy films did such a remarkable job on 1940's One Million BC and also the flapper who slips on a pie at the end of the silent Battle of the Century and actress in other LH silents beautiful Anita Garvin. Courtesy of the fan club incidentally I am in possession of a Sons of the Desert fez as shown at the beginning of the film. Replica of course! Little chance of wearing it now.I realize that the above may not be of great interest to some readers here but I believe that diedinthewool LH fans like me will find these offscreen reminisces of interest. Really Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were the greatest. We will not see their like again.".

Three guests that I do recall were Darla Hood from Our Gang comedies Roy Searight special effects wizard who in addition to working on Laurel and Hardy films did such a remarkable job on 1940's One Million BC and also the flapper who slips on a pie at the end of the silent Battle of the Century and actress in other LH silents beautiful Anita Garvin. Courtesy of the fan club incidentally I am in possession of a Sons of the Desert fez as shown at the beginning of the film. Replica of course! Little chance of wearing it now.I realize that the above may not be of great interest to some readers here but I believe that diedinthewool LH fans like me will find these offscreen reminisces of interest. Really Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were the greatest. We will not see their like again.";

While typical in plot and characterization this is one of their finest films as henpecked husbands who want to attend an out of town convention with their fellow lodge members. Of course their wives have a different idea and vehemently forbid them from attending such folly. Stan and Ollie come up with an outlandish plan that fools the leery wives but eventually backfires on the hapless pair. In this film we are treated with the funniest sight gags hilarious dialogue and most priceless facial expressions. Mae Busch and Dorothy Christy are equally outstanding with their performances as Mrs. Hardy and Mrs. Laurel. Charley Chase is very funny as one of the boisterous lodge attendees Stan and Ollie encounter. This comedy is a pure delight from beginning to end and never fails to bring a smile and much laughter. A must see for all Laurel and Hardy fans and for anyone who needs a cheery lift.".

	schema:reviewBody "Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy a renowned comedy duo from the first half of the 20th Century are still remembered today for their contributions to the genre which they certainly deserve to be. I was introduced to Laurel  Hardy during my childhood in the 90's with video tapes from my late grandfather. I remember seeing quite a bit of their work mostly shorts years ago and I think I found most of it hilarious! However I never saw this particular fulllength film considered by many to be their funniest flick until this year. Knowing how popular it was and knowing it was from a comedy team that had made me laugh so hard in the past I obviously had lofty expectations for Sons of the Desert. I think those expectations were met! Stan and Ollie are members of a fraternity known as the Sons of the Desert. This organization is about to hold its annual convention in Chicago and they take an oath to attend. Stan is reluctant afraid his wife won't let him attend but it turns out that Ollie's wife is the one who won't let her husband go to the convention as the couple have planned a trip to the mountains. Determined to avoid breaking the oath Ollie pretends to be ill and Stan gets a doctor who happens to be a veterinarian to prescribe an ocean voyage to Honolulu. So Stan and Ollie go to the convention with their wives thinking they've gone on the Hawaiian voyage! It won't be that easy trying to keep their wives from knowing where they've actually been especially after the boat they are supposedly on sinks in a typhoon while the two are on their way home!Sons of the Desert consistently had me laughing often hard like I was expecting and I can't think of a single lame gag in the entire film! If you're familiar with Laurel  Hardy I'm sure you know to expect a lot of physicalvisual humour which is all done very well here. Other things that make this film so funny include Laurel's famous crying some priceless lines from him such as what he says about the veterinarian and Hardy's reactions to Laurel's mistakes. This is all typical of the duo. They first appear in the film at a meeting with the Sons of the Desert and as soon as they enter the humour and foolishness begin! This continues pretty much nonstop for most of the film! Ollie's shorttempered wife played by Mae Busch is another comic highlight and so is an appearance from comedian Charley Chase. All these things should make the film a great viewing experience for many people who like slapstick and chaos in comedy!".

If any man is unsure whether he can keep the pledge the Exalted Ruler continues he will pleased be seated. Stans sits down and a shocked Ollie quickly gets him up Ollie knows better than to trifle with the Exalted Ruler in his Arab costume in the dark with only a spotlight on his face he looks like Boris Karloff in The Mummy.On the way home Stan explains that he sat down out of fear that his wife wouldn't let him go to the convention. Ollie immediately launches into his King of the Castle speech. Why don't you pattern your life after mine? I go places and do things and then tell my wife.Of course once they arrive home it is clear who wears the pants in Ollie's household and it isn't him. His wife Lottie Mae Busch tells him in no uncertain terms that he's not going to the convention he's going to the mountains with her. And to solidify her position she aims a few glass bowls at Ollie's head the way she throws she should be pitching for the Yankees.Stan is even more dense than usual if such a thing is possible. He eats Mrs. Hardy's wax apples all the while wondering why they don't taste quite right. Ollie naturally has a scheme he'll pretend to be sick and they'll get a doctor to tell Mrs. Hardy he needs an ocean voyage to Honolulu then Stan and Ollie will go to the convention. As much as he tries Stan just doesn't seem to get it. He asks Ollie Why do you want to go to Honolulu? He sends for an animal doctor to examine Ollie. Ollie Why did you get a veterinarian? Stan Well I didn't think his religion would make any difference. When Lottie asks Stan if he can go to Honolulu with Ollie he says he can't because he asked his wife Betty Dorothy Christie and she said he could go to the convention.At the convention Stan and Ollie watch a number called Honolulu Baby a satire on the Warner Brothers musicals of the early 30's. Normally such an interlude should be dismissed out of hand but here it serves to advance the plot. With great satisfaction Ollie tells Stan You see we've killed two birds with one stone. We're seeing as much here as we could have seen in Honolulu. Special mention needs to made of Charley Chase who does a terrific job as the raucous conventioneer everyone tries to avoid. His idea of a great time is to drop a wallet on the floor and hit someone on the behind with a paddle when they stoop to pick it up.Meanwhile unbeknown st to them the ship that the boys were supposed to be on has sunk in a typhoon and survivors have been picked up by a rescue ship. Lottie and Betty often so critical of their husbands' antics are now nearly panicstricken. They go down to the steamship company to get a list of the survivors but it hasn't come out yet.In a great scene which again helps to move things forward the girls try to relax by taking in a movie. On comes a newsreel showing the parade of the Sons of the Desert through the streets of Chicago. Just as Lottie tearfully proclaims that she wishes she had let Ollie go to the convention on screen come Stan and Ollie mugging for the camera. Grief turns to rage in a matter of seconds. And another Lauel and Hardy outing is about to become a disaster.".

This gets the two into difficulty with their wives and from there things build up into the kinds of predicaments that are familiar from their shorter features. What's rather impressive is how well they keep things going for so long. There's nothing that's forced or pointless and the pacing is generally just right.

	schema:reviewBody "In an impressively austere fraternal lodge seriouslooking men with incongruous fez on their hands swear together to be present at the next convention in Chicago. That such a trivial thing deserved an oath is funny enough but that the hymn they sang included the humming of the Streets of Cairo tune was so hilarious that it put me on a good mood... and I had to replay the scene. So the oath goes on in all solemnity... there's just something about the two members whose late arrival didn't go unnoticed a few minutes before. The fat man with the chubby fingers enthusiastically goes with the crowd while the sadlooking thin man hesitates a bit because he needs his wife's consent. But what is a man who can't be a king in his own castle? That's Oliver Hardy coercing Stan Laurel to be a man like him or just a man until we realize later that Hardy might be a king in his castle but the 'chessboard' way. It's still the queen Mrs. Hardy played by Mae Busch who makes the moves... among them throwing any kind of dishes on his head if that's what it takes to remind him that they were supposed to go to the mountains... the same week as the convention. Mrs. Laurel Dorothy Christy is a less hottempered individual but that's not saying much from the way she handles a shotgun we understand poor Stanley is lucky enough to be merely a pawn in his house. All that set the tone in a way that would content many feminists... or does it? Hardy must still find a way to slip through the marital net and take Stanley with him. Watching the film in 2018 made me wonder how a husband can ever think of cheating or even lying today ... when he basically carries a rectangular Big Brother in his pocket. Sons of the Desert belongs to a time where the IPhone inventor's father was probably a toddler so men could indulge to any of their personal fantasies without fearing a rolling pin hit from their gownclad curlerhaired missus. All they needed was an alibi... and a few allies to sustain it. It's not as easy as it sounds and if the film concludes that honesty is the best policy hilariously turned to politics by mumbling Stanley let's just say it spares all kinds of troubles being honest. But when you are a sophisticated mastermind like Hardy you might be willing to take the risk and build an alibi as durable as the pyramids. But with a friend like Laurel you might as well make a house of cards near a ventilator. And the film works on the expectations that whatever can go wrong to dig a breech in their fortress will go wrong but it's all in the way it does. And Sons of the Desert is not only funny but remarkable in the way many gags still hold up today honorable mentions to the 'discovery' moment in the theater and the faces the two hammy acolytes make in front of the camera to the final confrontation with Hardy's retort that the excuse is too farfetched not to be true and his meaculpa babyish faces once his perjury is revealed.If anything the film made me realize how funny Hardy is despite being the straight man. When he says well here's another nice mess you've gotten me into in a line that overarches all the adventures that delighted kids and adults for generations there's the selfdenial about his own responsibility. It's not the usual clown and straight man pairing but the humorously symbiosis of two conflicting attitudes both too rational or sensitive for their own good except that it's sensitivity that pays off at the end and provides the Aesopian conclusion. Speaking of that line if it wasn't for its inclusion in the AFI's Top 100 Movie Quotes or if Sons of the Desert wasn't the only representative of the iconic duo in the AFI Top comedies the film wouldn't have picked my curiosity. Later another AFI montage showed Laurel and Hardy in an adventure seemingly set in the desert and I was pretty sure the film would be one of these exotic escapades  la Road to Morocco especially with the fez. Little did I know that the film would be rather intimate pioneering the style and ambiance of TV sitcoms.And to conclude on the AFI It's a wonder that Laurel and Hardy didn't make it in the Top stars like Chaplin Keaton or the Marx Brothers... and I almost blame myself for waiting so long before watching their movies. I grew up reading their comics I'll never forget a time of my childhood where they were aired every day and I always laughed at the sight of a panicstricken Laurel crying and making these sad tizzy eyes. Now I realize how hilarious Hardy also is... in a subtler way.The one thing that bugged me in the film though was the numerous cuts and abrupt editing sometimes within one scene I thought it looked amateurish until I read on IMDb trivia that it was because Laurel was so funny they had to cut and reshoot the scenes. When even flaws speak for the film's greatness what else can you say?Maybe I would conclude with Danny Kaye's quote They made us laugh because in them we kind of saw ourselves ridiculous frustrated up to our necks in trouble but nevertheless ourselves Maybe that's the secret Chaplin and Keaton played solitary men Lloyd was romantic and nerdy and the Marx Brothers were too anarchical and nuts. Laurel and Hardy reminded me the ways I tried to fool my wife by starting with a lie that would escalate to nowhere and causing more troubles than sparing them. That's the essence of Sons of the Deserts and why for its oldfashioned charm the film can be still enjoyed by modern audiences.".

Previously only available on VHS tape with the poorly surviving colorized footage of the Exodus and Parting of the Red Sea provided as a separate Extra on the DVDused it was difficult to realize just how beautifully done the silent epic was.

Orrison's commentary is full of interesting insights as well as being enjoyable due to her enthusiasm about so many details. And Gaylord Carter's Wurlitzer Pipe Organ score is very impressive as well as being a marvelous record of an organ score done by one who actually performed during the silent eraon this digital stereo recording. The 1956 remake looks and sounds great as are the all of the special features for it but this is exactly the same as the previous second edition of this title. I bought the new edition in order to see what they had done with the 1923 version  and I certainly am impressed. Also I love the packaging for this edition.

	schema:reviewBody "Director Cecil B. Demille Script Jeaine Macpherson Cast Theodore Roberts Moses Charles de Rochfort Rameses Estelle Taylor Miriamsister of Moses Julia Faye wife of pharaoh James Neill Aaron Edythe Chapman Mrs. Martha Mc Tavish Richard Dix Johnson Rod La Rosque Danson Nita Naldi Sally LungEurasianMost people today have probably never seen this film. It is now available on the 50th anniversary set with the 1956 version. The 1956 version was an amazing movie but in many ways I prefer this one Cecil B Demille's 1923 original. Many people will be surprised upon first viewing of this film. Demille uses a different approach thin in his 1956 remake. This film has two parts. The first part is set during the time of the exodus in the old testament. The Hebrew nation is enslaved by the Egyptians under the ruthless rule of the pharaoh Rameses. Moses as the chosen leader of the Jews frees his people from the Egyptians. God gives him the power to inflict plagues upon the Egyptians. He then leads his people on the great exodus across the desert to the Red Sea. God gives him the power to part the sea so the Jewish people can cross. Phaorah orders his army to go after the Jews across the parted Red Sea but God had the sea 'return to normal' so the army drowns.Make no mistake this film was a major production in its day and very high budget for its time. Demille uses very elaborate sets for this production. The exterior wall of the great Egyptian city is just like the one used in the 1956 version. Many extras were used in the making of this film. During the great exodus there appears to be people for as far as the eye can see. You can see this great line of people spread out across the desert. Camels were seen during the exodus but as it turns out camels were not in the middle east during that time period. The parting of the Red Sea in the 1956 version was considered an amazing special effect for its time. I was very curious as to how they would be able to pull this off in 1923! I was quite amazed!! The special effects used for the parting of the sea is just as good as the 56 perhaps better. One thing I really like about the special effects of this film is the wall of fire that Moses creates to keep the Egyptian army at bay. In the 56 version animation was used for the fire. In this version real fire was used using a double exposure technique that I thought was more impressive. Mr Demille was very loyal to his actors. He would use many of the same actors in a number of his films. The women who plays the part of pharaoh's wife and the boy that played his son are both involved in the 56 version as well as the film editor.The film switches gears totally for the second half. We are now in modern times. It starts with a mother reading passages from the book of Exodus to her two sons. All the drama from the first half was simply her reading being acted out. The rest of the film is a morality tale between two sons. The mother and one son are deeply religious while the other son is a nonbeliever. He makes fun of his brother's silly beliefs so the mother kicks him out of the house for being a heathen. The believing son lives a modest life while the unbelieving son becomes very wealthy. He even gets the women they both like! He becomes a wealthy contractor employing his brother as a worker. However the unbelieving brother's life will be filed with misfortune eventually leading to his death. The twist in the second half of the film makes for a interesting viewing experience. I like the contrast between ancient and modern times. Katherine Orrison in her commentary states that the modern sequence will probably seem more dated to the average viewer. I tend to agree. It is interesting to see how people lived and dressed during those times. The modern sequence is filmed mostly on location in San Francisco. It is cool to see how San Fran looked back then. The generation gap between the mother and her sons is very evident. This was the roaring 20's! Katherine Orrison gives an insightful commentary on both films but see seems to have a special fondness for this one. I can understand why.".

Demille Script Jeaine Macpherson Cast Theodore Roberts Moses Charles de Rochfort Rameses Estelle Taylor Miriamsister of Moses Julia Faye wife of pharaoh James Neill Aaron Edythe Chapman Mrs. Martha Mc Tavish Richard Dix Johnson Rod La Rosque Danson Nita Naldi Sally LungEurasianMost people today have probably never seen this film. It is now available on the 50th anniversary set with the 1956 version. The 1956 version was an amazing movie but in many ways I prefer this one Cecil B Demille's 1923 original. Many people will be surprised upon first viewing of this film. Demille uses a different approach thin in his 1956 remake. This film has two parts. The first part is set during the time of the exodus in the old testament. The Hebrew nation is enslaved by the Egyptians under the ruthless rule of the pharaoh Rameses. Moses as the chosen leader of the Jews frees his people from the Egyptians. God gives him the power to inflict plagues upon the Egyptians. He then leads his people on the great exodus across the desert to the Red Sea. God gives him the power to part the sea so the Jewish people can cross. Phaorah orders his army to go after the Jews across the parted Red Sea but God had the sea 'return to normal' so the army drowns.Make no mistake this film was a major production in its day and very high budget for its time. Demille uses very elaborate sets for this production. The exterior wall of the great Egyptian city is just like the one used in the 1956 version. Many extras were used in the making of this film. During the great exodus there appears to be people for as far as the eye can see. You can see this great line of people spread out across the desert. Camels were seen during the exodus but as it turns out camels were not in the middle east during that time period. The parting of the Red Sea in the 1956 version was considered an amazing special effect for its time. I was very curious as to how they would be able to pull this off in 1923! I was quite amazed!! The special effects used for the parting of the sea is just as good as the 56 perhaps better. One thing I really like about the special effects of this film is the wall of fire that Moses creates to keep the Egyptian army at bay. In the 56 version animation was used for the fire. In this version real fire was used using a double exposure technique that I thought was more impressive. Mr Demille was very loyal to his actors. He would use many of the same actors in a number of his films. The women who plays the part of pharaoh's wife and the boy that played his son are both involved in the 56 version as well as the film editor.The film switches gears totally for the second half.

All that in 45 minutes.  That means it spools out really really fast.

It's quite different in its conception from the more familiar 1950's version and so direct comparisons are not always possible yet it holds up well by itself anyway.Rather than concentrating on the biblical story as in the remake here DeMille first tells an abbreviated version of the MosesExodus narrative and then uses it as the thematic basis for a modern morality tale.

The modernday story is similar to many other films of the 1910's and 1920's but it is interesting and it is told well.Although DeMille is known for his lavish spectacles he also knew how to create some more subtle effects when he wanted to.

This film is told in two parts as we get to see Moses receiving the Ten Commandments from God in what looks like a Fourth of July celebration.  One with good fireworks.  Most people know that storyMoses goes to deliver the Commandments only to find everyone involved in a massive orgy.  Here de Mille is in his element.  He did so many massive orgies that he should have copyrighted them.  We see people making out not having sexthat would be wrong men licking wine off women's feet that is wrong by gum and a huge number of people trying to climb up what looks like a curtain.  Why they're doing this only de Mille knows.  All we need is Gloria Swanson being pawed by a tiger to make everything perfect.  As some viewers may not know de Mille can show whatever sin and debauchery he wants because the sinners are going to get it in the end.  They're gonna get it bad.  From the giddy Israelites and their golden calf we're transported to the modern day 1923 where a woman reads the Bible.  She can't be the sinner.  A son stands nearby looking very noble and content.  Can't be him.  Then we see the other son.  He looks bored and disbelieving.  We have a sinner!  Oh and he's a bad one.  He dances on Sunday he steals women from their intendeds he's involved in dozens of dirty dealings and he's dating an Oriental leper.   Beg pardon?  I guess she's just thrown in for fun.Of course all's well that ends well and everything turns out okay.  This movie is silent so the acting is a bit inyourface and the characters are extreme but hey.  It's necessaryliteracy wasn't rampant back then so filmmakers had to make everything painfully obvious.

	schema:headline " Great prologue slow main feature";
	schema:reviewBody "Cecil B. DeMille's original silent version of the Ten Commandments is mostly a heavyhanded morality play set in 1923. The prologue which runs just over 40 minutes shows an abbreviated version of the Biblical story of the Exodus. Most of the dialogue is taken from the Bible. Despite the technical limitations of the era it succeeds as a fastpaced spectacular. The parting of the Red Sea is just as aweinspiring in its own way as in the remake and it's always interesting to see how silent actors compensated for the lack of sound with facial expressions and exaggerated gestures. The musical score is fantastic and everything clips along at a nice pace. As with the remake it's never subtle but it's never boring either.I wish I could say the same about the main part of the feature. After Moses punishes the Hebrews for worshipping the golden calf the film moves to the present day 1920s. A mother reads to her grown sons from the Bible. The two brothers are basically Goofus and Gallant. From here everything is completely predictable.It's well done so that one can overlook the lack of subtlety. DeMille has a very explicit religious message and he's not above bludgeoning the viewer over the head with it. That was the style of the day and the limitations of the silent film force a certain amount of overstatement.However unlike most films of this period this one goes on far too long. It's about ninety minutes but seems far longer. The bad son goes out into the world declaring that he's going to break all 10 Commandments! Naturally he becomes a successful businessman... while his humble older brother a carpenter naturally tries not to envy him or covet his wife. There's never any doubt about how it's all going to end DeMille's message is that the wages of sin is death but he takes far too long to get there.The complete film is about 135 minutes which must have been an epic length for that era. I would have enjoyed it more if the modern story had been trimmed by about 15 minutes.In his way DeMille was the forerunner of Mel Gibson. Both are gifted filmmakers with devout religious beliefs  short on subtlety heavy on the bloodshed and headlong action. The 1956 remake of Ten Commandments is a spectacular example of epic filmmaking and as this 1923 silent original is now included as an extra disc in the DVD it's worth checking out. I can't imagine wanting to sit through the modern story again though I'll probably shut it off once Moses segues off screen.".

	schema:reviewBody "Early in this movie we learn that Egypt has already been visited by nine plagues none of which we get to see. What's the deal? we ask ourselves. This is especially perplexing considering that the movie is two hours and sixteen minutes long. Even the tenth plague the one where all of Egypt's firstborn die is disappointing for the deaths are only implied We see the Pharaoh's son alive later we see him dead. That's the last straw of course and so the Pharaoh tells Moses to take his people and get out.As we all know people pick and choose the parts of the Bible they agree with and ignore the rest. One of the items people usually ignore is the one in Exodus 123536 in which the Jews loot Egypt before they leave taking the Egyptians' gold and silver jewelry and some nice clothes as well. Force apparently was not used. They simply told the Egyptians they only wanted to borrow the stuff and the Egyptians fell for it because God put them in a lending mood. The intertitle in the movie says And they despoiled the Egyptians of jewels of silver jewels of gold and raiment. It was stealing of course but that's all right because they hadn't yet received the Ten Commandments from God one of which says Thou shalt not steal. So they didn't know any better.It would have been nice if their borrowing the gold and silver had been depicted in the movie but all we get is just one lousy intertitle. Immediately after all you see is a bunch of people leaving Egypt. It makes you wonder why they even bothered to put it in the movie. It also makes you wonder if that was the real reason the Pharaoh changed his mind and chased after the Jews Hey! They borrowed our gold and silver jewelry and I'll bet they don't intend to return it. Let's go get it back.We finally get some spectacle when the Jews come to the Red Sea. Not bad considering. Then Moses climbs the mountain to receive the title commandments. While he is away the Jews begin to party. And now we realize why it was necessary to include the part about the gold and silver. How else would the Jews have been able to make a Golden Calf? But it would have been crude to show the Jews actually stealing the stuff so we get just enough information in the intertitle so we don't wonder where a bunch of slaves got all the gold to make a great big idol. In other words an explanation for how the Jews got enough gold to make a Golden Calf was needed but the embarrassing manner in which they obtained that gold is downplayed.Miriam Moses's sister displays much of her body and gets all sensual with the Golden Calf. Dathan who is no good starts to make love to her but then he sees she has leprosy. Now in the Bible God does eventually inflict Miriam with leprosy because she objected to Moses marrying a black woman from Ethiopia Numbers 12 but in this movie she gets inflicted with the disease during the Golden Calf party. Moses breaks the tablets in anger Miriam begs him to heal her and God lashes out with bolts of lightning ending the party.It is at this point that we find out why we were shortchanged on the first nine plagues of Egypt. After only fifty minutes of screen time with almost an hour and a half to go the movie jumps to the present and we discover that we have been watching a visualization of the story in The Book of Exodus as it was being read by a woman to her two adult sons Johnny and Dan.At the beginning of the movie there is a prologue that tells of how belief in God had come to be thought of as a religious complex and how people had come to think of the Ten Commandments as old fashioned. But then came the World War. And now a blooddrenched bitter worldno longer laughingcries for a way out. That way of course is the Ten Commandments the Law without which men cannot live.The World War must have already worn off on Dan however and it isn't long before his mother turns him out of the house for being a no good atheist. What follows is a crazy plot in which Dan marries Mary the two of them promising to break all ten Commandments.We don't see Dan and Mary making any graven images of God but other than that they do presumably break the other nine Commandments and the juicy ones are actually depicted. Dan cheats on Mary having an affair with a woman Sally Lung a woman half French and half Chinese. As for the Commandment Thou shalt not kill Dan inadvertently does in his own mother when the cathedral he was building with shoddy cement collapses on her. And it turns out that the ship that brought in the cheap material for making that cement passed by an island that was a leper colony from which place Sally Lung stowed away. Dan gets the disease and he ends up giving it to Mary just before he ends up dying in his effort to escape the law.Mary tries to run away to possibly planning to kill herself now that she has leprosy but Johnny stops her. He reads to her from The New Testament telling her about love and in the morning she is cured of the disease. This squares with the dying words of the mother who said she was wrong to make religion to be about fear instead of love. But it doesn't exactly square with the prologue which said the Ten Commandments not The New Testament were what people needed following the World War.".

Now in the Bible God does eventually inflict Miriam with leprosy because she objected to Moses marrying a black woman from Ethiopia Numbers 12 but in this movie she gets inflicted with the disease during the Golden Calf party. Moses breaks the tablets in anger Miriam begs him to heal her and God lashes out with bolts of lightning ending the party.It is at this point that we find out why we were shortchanged on the first nine plagues of Egypt. After only fifty minutes of screen time with almost an hour and a half to go the movie jumps to the present and we discover that we have been watching a visualization of the story in The Book of Exodus as it was being read by a woman to her two adult sons Johnny and Dan.At the beginning of the movie there is a prologue that tells of how belief in God had come to be thought of as a religious complex and how people had come to think of the Ten Commandments as old fashioned. But then came the World War. And now a blooddrenched bitter worldno longer laughingcries for a way out. That way of course is the Ten Commandments the Law without which men cannot live.The World War must have already worn off on Dan however and it isn't long before his mother turns him out of the house for being a no good atheist. What follows is a crazy plot in which Dan marries Mary the two of them promising to break all ten Commandments.We don't see Dan and Mary making any graven images of God but other than that they do presumably break the other nine Commandments and the juicy ones are actually depicted. Dan cheats on Mary having an affair with a woman Sally Lung a woman half French and half Chinese. As for the Commandment Thou shalt not kill Dan inadvertently does in his own mother when the cathedral he was building with shoddy cement collapses on her. And it turns out that the ship that brought in the cheap material for making that cement passed by an island that was a leper colony from which place Sally Lung stowed away. Dan gets the disease and he ends up giving it to Mary just before he ends up dying in his effort to escape the law.Mary tries to run away to possibly planning to kill herself now that she has leprosy but Johnny stops her. He reads to her from The New Testament telling her about love and in the morning she is cured of the disease. This squares with the dying words of the mother who said she was wrong to make religion to be about fear instead of love. But it doesn't exactly square with the prologue which said the Ten Commandments not The New Testament were what people needed following the World War.";

The restored print of this history making silent film is simply amazing so sharp and crystal clear with zero flickering. Furthermore this version is the same the reverse and also different from the 1956 version.It's the same in that De Mille rebuilt the same set of Ramses' city  larger than the towers built for D. W. Griffith's 'Intolerance' 1916 for the '56 version used much of the same script camera angles and other sets. It's the reverse because as Katherine Orrison notes on the commentary track if a shot was done from the right side in the '23 version it was filmed from the left in the '56 version and vice versa. She kids us not! She's written three books about C.B. It is different from the '56 version in two major ways. First the story of Moses begins with him giving the ninth plague killing the first born and ends with him hurling the 10 Commandments down at the revellers worshipping the Golden Calf below Mount Sinai. Second the movie then becomes a second story the Biblical scenes are called The Prologue taking place in San Francisco.The Modern Story is about the brothers John a carpenter Richard Dix and Danny an architect Rod La Roque and their struggles with morality. Danny vows to break all ten commandments and by the end of the movie he has. Like Ramses drowned in the Red Sea Danny escaping to Mexico in his speed boat 'Defiance' also drowns smashed on a large rock that looks suspiciously like Mount Sinai. Note Before Richard Dix went on to fame and success in sound movies mostly for RKO he starred in many other silent films check out his great performance in 'The Vanishing American' 1925 as an Indian.Visually interesting throughout the film even takes place on the construction site of the Catholic cathedral in Washington Square in San Francisco as it was being built. Actually shot in the outside construction elevator on the roof you get to see a lot of the vista of 1923 San Francisco! Let's all meet at Washington Square for the 100th anniversary of this film! Plus the whole movie really works. What sets and costumes! The parting of the Red Sea in this version is even better than the 1956 one! I give it an 8.".

Of course Dix falls in love with Ms. Joy after she becomes his brother's wife DeMille's morality tale is extremely heavyhanded but nevertheless enticing and expertly directed. The Biblical and Modern story format recalls D.W. Griffith's superior Intolerance 1916. The allstar cast it's 1923 remember performs exceptionally with La Rocque being seen in one of his finest performances. As any actor will tell you La Rocque was halfway there upon receiving the bad brother role over Dix  and La Rocque runs away with the film. His is a Best Actorworthy performance.

	schema:reviewBody "Going on 90 years since it was first released the original The Ten Commandments can still overawe you with the spectacle of both the biblical prologue and the modern story. Modern in the sense that it was set during the Jazz Age Roaring Twenties the 1923 when Paramount released what would become that studio's biggest moneymaker up to that time.You'll recognize the biblical prologue if you've seen the 1956 remake it is almost a 45 minute scene for scene remake of the time that Charlton Heston and John Carradine arrive at the Egyptian court until the destruction of the Golden calf. They weren't giving Oscars back in 1923 but the parting of the Red Sea was incredible for its time and would have given Cecil B. DeMille yet another Oscar for the same event.You won't recognize a lot of the biblical prologue cast but they were part and parcel of a DeMille stock company that he developed during silent era and continued to a lesser degree after the coming of sound. Best known probably was Estelle Taylor who was married to Jack Dempsey at the time as Miriam the sister of Moses. The bulk of the film is the modern story which has the theme break the Ten Commandments and they'll break you. The stars are Richard Dix and Rod LaRocque a pair of brothers one good and one bad sons of a most pious mother Edythe Chapman. Dix is a good honest and steady carpenter by trade and LaRocque through his ruthlessness and who winds up breaking all the Commandments becomes the richest contractor in the state. LaRocque is pretty ruthless in his private affairs he breaks the Commandments regarding those as well. He marries Leatrice Joy who Dix likes as well but then gets a fetching Eurasian mistress in Nita Naldi. Nita is in the slinky and sexy tradition of all DeMille's bad girls. It all ends really bad for LaRocque as his sins catch up with him. During the modern story DeMille hand with spectacle is a good one in the scene of the church collapse and later on during the climatic escape LaRocque is attempting to make with a speedboat on a stormy night at sea.The influence of DeMille's educator father Henry and his friend David Belasco are strong here as they are in all DeMille work. The modern story is the kind of morality play that Belasco would produce and write for the stage for years. It's from the Victorian era but the Roaring Twenties audience wanted something that reflected traditional values occasionally as if nervously waiting for its excesses to catch up. It's partly the reason why they could find comfort in a Congregationalist president of the USA in Calvin Coolidge. Though the story is unbelievably dated DeMille's cinematic techniques are hardly that. The original Ten Commandments in many ways will tell you about its creator warts and all.".

Brutalized by their cruel Egyptian masters The Children of Israel toil before the monumental city gates of Pharaoh Rameses II. The opening scenes of Cecil B. DeMille's 1923 epic The Ten Commandments represent the historical spectacle of Hollywood's silent era at its grandest and most expressive. DeMille blended the intensely dramatic performance of his actors with the spectacular architecture of his sets in a way that seemed to bring the past to life for the movie going audience. His exhaustive research and striving for authenticity was limited only by his personal satisfaction. Of the roughly 2500 extras used one tenth were orthodox Jews from Los Angeles many recent immigrants who felt they were living the history of their ancestors. The flight from Egypt includes the added surprise of twocolor Technicolor while the scenes of decadence as the Golden Calf is worshiped by an undulating mob are as vibrantly electric as any ever filmed. To be fair it bears pointing out that the fortyfive minute Ancient Egypt portion of The Ten Commandments is only a prologue to the modern story which today seems dated and irrelevant. Two brothers one good and one evil alternately respect and defy the ancient laws of Moses and live with the consequences. The San Francisco setting may be of interest to anyone with ties to the city by the bay specifically the 1920's North Beach neighborhood Saints Peter and Paul Church and Washington Square Park which are all prominently featured. Sexy Nita Naldi is also delightfully vampish as the heavylidded other woman draped in furs. The Jeanie Macpherson screenplay attempts to draw parallels between the story of Exodus and modern life much more successfully accomplished in Michael Curtiz 1928 epic masterpiece Noah's Ark but the jazz age story can't hold a candle to the grandeur of the ancient world. DeMille's original does succeed if compared to the bloated boringly overdetailed story and hammy acting of his 1956 remake. The 1923 prologue is concise well paced and beautifully executed. The ancient Babylon of D. W. Griffith's 1916 spectacular Intolerance appears staged and remote when compared to a genuine sense of seeing and feeling the hear and now conjured up by DeMille's City of the Pharaoh. Hollywood produced progressively greater and more fantastic historical epics as the era drew to a close including the MGM spectacle Ben Hur in 1925 and DeMille's King of Kings in 1927.  the spirit of the spectacle and the joy taken in its own magic was unique to the silent film.

But as obvious as the Jello used for the Red Sea parting is it cannot take away from how great this film really is. Now don't get me wrong the 1956 version is unbelievable itself but while looking at this one you get a sense of DeMille trying to tell us something about ourselves our way of life and of course what we are doing wrong. The prologue itself is extremely quick. That could be because I saw the '56 version prior to this one. The rest of the story drags a little bit but not too much don't get me wrong this is a long movie the package reads 146 minutes it's really 136 but if you have the time you could make it through in one sitting. I'd recommend renting this movie only if you can find it though because it really is worth watching it and seeing how we are today and how we can make ourselves better by doing certain things a certain way. I can't put it in to words though only this film can. It's an intriguing motion picture experience to behold. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "The Ten Commandments marks the beginning of the second wave of the Hollywood epic. Modelled on the contemporaryancient parallel storytelling of Intolerance  the crowning achievement of the first wave  and its subject matter decided by a poll of cinemagoers this is among the most significant and typically DeMillean of DeMille's pictures.DeMille had first coupled a historical tale with a modern day framing story in 1916's Joan the Woman and even during the years when the historical feature was out of fashion approximately 1918  1921 he several times added a little metaphorical foray into the past to his contemporary dramas such as Male and Female and Manslaughter. Here it is still the modern day narrative which makes up the bulk of the picture's 130odd minutes and yet it is the spectacular biblical prologue that everyone remembers.DeMille had always had a talent for directing crowd scenes giving inspiring pep talks to the mass whilst giving specific directions to the individuals. Here he works with the biggest group of extras he had ever handled and yet he has lost none of his touch. He gives character to the multitude by focusing on a number of individuals within it and yet when he pulls back to show the whole crowd you can still see the attention to detail with a hundred different things going on. The stupendous sets also make an impact in themselves but DeMille is shrewd enough to reveal them gradually and places them squarely in the context of being symbolic of evil. The pharaoh's palace may be impressive but DeMille ensures that the works of God  the pillar of fire the parting of the red sea the lightning on Sinai  are more so. Oddly he could be accused of doing the opposite in his 1956 remake in which the Egyptian city is absolutely aweinspiring whereas the special effects representing acts of God are somewhat pathetic even for the day and certainly less effective than those in 1923. But DeMille had changed a lot by that time.In contrast to the prologue the contemporary story is somewhat lacklustre. It has much in common with other DeMille dramas from around this period although it is pretty mediocre by that standard. Particularly jarring is the overuse of intertitles. Five years earlier DeMille had been a master of purely visual narrative and the titles were only there when absolutely necessary. As time went by however as DeMille had become more pious and his screenwriter Jeanie Macpherson had become more pretentious so had the photoplays become more wordy. All the better for preaching with as far as selfappointed messengerofGod DeMille was concerned but his pictures began to lack the grace and smoothness they had once had.With scenes fragmented into smaller pieces and characters unable to open their mouths without a superfluous title spelling their words out to the audience the acting also suffers. Richard Dix Rod La Rocque Leatrice Joy and Nita Naldi are all adequate performers but none of them really gets time or space to emote as much as they ought to for the story. Nevertheless DeMille was still a master of the powerful iconic image and there are enough memorable shots here to keep things interesting. Among the standouts are Nita Naldi's hands emerging from a tear in a sack the straightup shot in the lift as Leatrice Joy ascends and Naldi ripping the curtain off its hooks nearly forty years before the almost identical shot in Hitchcock's Psycho. It is images like this which reign supreme in DeMille's cinema and it is from around this point on that they become more important than the credibility of the story or the actors.DeMille's Ten Commandments proved to be highly influential. Other studios got to work on their own superproductions the western would become epic with The Iron Horse and even Douglas Fairbanks next picture The Thief of Bagdad was steeped in DeMillean grandeur. Further afield UFA studios in Germany and Abel Gance in France were also working on the principle that big is beautiful. Ten Commandments indicated the future for DeMille himself as well. Not only was it the first of the pictures that would secure his legacy as the ultimate biblical filmmaker but the fact that the prologue is absolutely breathtaking and the contemporary drama lacks bite hints towards his eventually becoming a director purely of epics. It's also rather telling that he loved the Old Testament God of plagues and smiting because that is probably more or less how DeMille saw himself. He hammered home his messages with the spectacular and the incredible. A shockandawe filmmaker preaching the word of a shockandawe God.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE TEN COMMANDMENTS Paramount 1923 a super special production directed by Cecil B. DeMille is the director's attempt in religious spectacle. Although DeMille already directed a story on Joan of Arc in JOAN THE WOMAN 1917 this is his attempt on doing something a little bit different from his previous efforts. As with the earlier silent classic of D.W. Griffith's INTOLERANCE 1916 consisting of four separate stories in no particular order this edition to THE TEN COMMANDMENTS unlike DeMille's most famous super fourhour 1956 edition starring Charlton Heston this earlier 136 minute production combines Old Testament story according to Exodus followed by another story set in modern times. The Biblical portion clocked at 50 minutes as opposed to the modernday story taking up much of the proceedings at 85 minutes could have been a separate movie at best. With two movies for the price of one THE TEN COMMANDMENTS simply shows God's Law being as relevant today as it was centuries ago.Opening Title Our modern world defined God as a religious complex and laughed at The Ten Commandments as OLDFASHIONED. Then through the laughter came the shattering thunder of the World War. And now a blood drenched bitter world  no longer laughing  cries for a way out. There is but one way out. It existed before it was engraved upon tablets of stone. It will exist when stone has crumbled. The Ten Commandments are not rules to obey as a personal favor to God. They are the fundamental principles without which mankind cannot live together. They are not laws they are the LAW.Prologue Egypt centuries ago where slaves are seen pulling the wheels carrying a gigantic statue with those getting whipped as they tire of such strenuous work. Ramesus the Magnificent Charles DeRoche rules with no compassion while his sister Miriam Estelle Taylor offers water to the abused slaves. Moses the Lawgiver Theodore Roberts through the guidance of God's voice leads His Children of Israel from bondage to the Promised Land. As Moses goes to Mount Sinai to speak to God in prayer God answers him by posting on two tablets through volts of lightning his law he labels The Ten Commandments. In the meantime his people are forsaking their God in favor of worshipping the Golden Calf. Modern Story Widow Martha McTavish Edythe Chapman is an overly religious woman with two grown sons John Richard Dix a carpenter and Dan Rod LaRocque an atheist who fails to see his mother's logic in her beliefs. While eating at Dugan's Lunch Wagon Dan encounters Mary Leigh Leatrice Joy a homeless young girl accompanied by her dog out in the rain stealing his food. Rather than having her arrested Dan invites her to her home for dinner with the company of his suspicious mother and brother. Through the passage of time John has fallen in love with Mary but loses her to Dan. Dan doesn't prove himself a good husband as he practically breaks the Ten Commandments by having a mistress in Sally Lung Nita Naldi from Molokai Leper Island and being the one responsible for one of his crooked deals by using bad concrete on a Cathedral he is constructing and much more. For anyone expecting a near scenebyscene original edition to DeMille's 1956 remake would be totally disappointed. The Biblical portion of the story shows great promise with lavish scale and costumes which makes one wish the entire story remained that way for about or under two hours. Theodore Roberts plays the whitebearded Moses to perfection possibly his most famous movie role of his entire career. Special effects including the parting of the Red Sea is top notch as is the visual style of the Ten Commandments flashing across the screen in full force. Though THE TEN COMMANDMENTS did prove successful in its standard form the sudden change to modern theme seems out of place. For The Ten Commandments it's the same then as it is today which is what DeMille proposes to his movie audience of 1923. Those witnessing Edythe Chapman's performance as an overly religious and domineering mother could possibly relate to her character who has been raised in similar circumstance with her forceful meaning turning away children from God rather than becoming closer. Rod LaRocque who resembles that of actor Rudolph Valentino convincingly plays the one who gets turned off by religion. Richard Dix early in his career before his success in talkies and beyond and he being the best known actor in the entire cast should gather the most attention from movie buffs. And that's Agnes Ayres in a cameo playing an outcast for the modern story.Formerly presented on cable television's American Movie Classics 19931998 THE TEN COMMANDMENTS was also available on video cassette around the same time accompanied by excellent organ score by Gaylord Carter. DVD with same scoring with crisp picture print condition features an added bonus of a commentary spoken by author Katherine Orrison whose historical accounts regarding this movie is most informative for those unfamiliar with THE TEN COMMANDMENTS according to DeMille.

DeMille does not modify the original Jewish origin of his source although he underlines the Christian commandments. The script of the famous prologue was literally taken from Exodus. The church in The Story is not clearly a protestant or Roman catholic house of worship. However when the orthodox Mrs. McTavish enters the church it collapses. Her famous last words '...whatever you've done is all my fault. I taught you to fear God in stead of to love him..' also indicate that DeMille hardly sympathizes with orthodox denominations. In the prologue DeMille's epic reaches a magnificent highpoint when the Red Sea tsunami protects the fleeing Jewish people before it swallows the Egyptian forces. The Story lacks such a climax. In fact Mrs.McTavish and her Bible becomes tedious in her struggle against the evil that her boys have ended up in. DeMille's 1923 version of The Ten Commandments may be a megatsunami against orthodox protestantism it is still a mass of light for the less orthodox moviegoer that believes in cinema only.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I reviewed The Ten Commandments 1956 I received a lot of 'Not Helpful' ratings. I assume this is because unlike the average review I did NOT particularly like the film and said so. Once again I buck the crowd as I definitely did NOT like this previous version as well. In the case of both films I seriously wonder whether or not the movies actually were a boon to atheists because the films were so incredibly badeven with the incredible Egyptian sets.Unlike the more famous 1956 version only the first 56 minutes of the film are about the Jews and the creation of the Commandments. The biggest differences you'll notice is that Moses is a very superficial characterand has very little to do in most of the film. In addition the Children of Israel actually leave Egypt about 2025 minutes into the filmand it's a 136 minute film. The rest of the film is actually set in the present day 1923 and is a very very heavyhanded morality tale with absolutely no hint of subtletynone. It comes on so strong and heavyhanded that I am sure many will laugh at its histrionics and silly plot.So what is to like about this film. Well first and foremost the DVD copy is perhaps the most pristine I have ever seen in a silent filmit's very very crisp and clean. And the Egyptian sets as I mentioned above are very nice. Apart from that the rest is just pretty silly. The famed parting of the red sea looked like melty jello. And imagine my surprise when I later read on IMDb that's really all it was!!! And as for the story it was bad in two serious ways. First the creation of the Commandments section was just too superficial and dispassionatelike the folks are acting out some halfbaked passion playwhere they really aren't too concerned with qualityjust getting the stupid thing done! Second the modern portion is much worse with it's message that comes across with all the subtlety of a 2x4 upside your skull!! As a result unless you are a diehard silent film fan or an atheist who hates God don't bother with this silly film. Why Cecil B. DeMille has somehow been considered a genius for his anti religious epics I have no idea! By the way a few final thoughts. First despite both of DeMille's films saying to the contrary archaeological evidence AND written accounts of the day indicate the Jews did NOT build the pyramids but professional builders. Second why did the Godly mother die in the film?! Didn't this seem to reinforce the notion that God is not real?! Talk about an illogically constructed religious message!! Though now that I think about it illogic was DeMille's fortewith nudity and bestiality in his other 'religious' epic Sign of the Cross!! And though it was NOT a DeMille film think about the original Ben Huras in the end Jesus STAYED DEAD!!! What a whacked out message! All very PreCode in their sensibilities and all CLAIMING to be family religious entertainment!".

	schema:reviewBody "DeMille's first attempt at the story of Moses has more in common with such other silent films contrasting the ancient past to stories of today than it does to his later epic retelling of the story. Griffith's Intolerance 7 years earlier had intercut several stories of sin and violence to show that the more man changes the more he stays the same Fritz Lang's Destiny and Carl Dreyer's Leaves from Satan's Book both 1921 also worked out biblical themes in both ancient and modern contexts. All four directors were at one point or another quite serious Christians though DeMille seems to have been the most obsessive in his faith and certainly his many films on Biblical themes are often more obvious and blunt in their attempts at pedagogy.Which is not to say that The Ten Commandments is just a lesson in thou shalt nots but it is throughout informed of a very deep and perhaps naive faith that the stories of the past are alive and exactly transferable to the lives we have today. In this case we see a man break essentially every commandment in his quest for personal greatness destroying in the process his own life and those of many around him including his own mother. DeMille doesn't intercut multiple story lines like his predecessors but rather uses the Biblical story as a 50minute prologue to one featurelength story taking place in modernday Los Angeles.It's fascinating to watch the film if you've just watched the later version as I did the prologue is almost exactly the same as the last 50 minutes of the '56 version picking up in the middle of the plagues that Moses has set upon Egypt. Like the later film only the killing of the firstborn is given significant play and the majority of this section is given over to the flight from Egypt the parting of the Red Sea jello! and destruction of the pursuing Egyptians and the creation of the Ten Commandments and Moses' fury at the idolators. It's all very well done in many respects more thrilling and powerful than in the later film with many scenes that DeMille obviously liked enough to redo almost shotforshot  the flight of the Israelites from the Egyptian city and in particular the shot of Moses standing in front of them exhorting them to flee are good examples. Theodore Roberts was 62 when the film was made and looks a bit crazy and obsessive  he certainly feels more like the older Moses to me than Charlton Heston though Charles de Rochefort doesn't leave a huge impression as Rameses. All in all it's quite a spectacle and segues nicely into...The modernday story of two carpenterarchitect brothers one ambitious and unscrupulous and the other honest and devoted to their saintly Biblereading mother and how they vie for the love of a vagrant girl who comes to their doorstep is obviously freighted with the weight of the prologue the two brothers quarrel over God there is honoring and not honoring of the parent coveting of the neighbor's or brother's wife stealing etc. The central theme couldn't be more obviously stated as they build a cathedral which ultimately collapses due to the bad brother's cheap materials killing someone dear. Every commandment gets tested and broken at one point or another but what's fascinating is how seamlessly they're all woven into a relatively simple story and how DeMille refuses to cast the bad brother as completely evil or the good brother as entirely strong and virtuous. Only the mother comes across as something of a caricature. Nicely lit and shot throughout  the rain sequence where the girl first comes to the home of the family is very real and moving and only the scenes involving the unscrupulous brother's mistress seem at all overwrought. This is overall a more graceful and disciplined film than the later version or any of DeMille's work that I've seen so far.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ten Commandments The 1923  out of 4 DeMille's first attempt at this story tells two different stories. The opening prologue running just under and hour sees Moses Theodore Roberts freeing the slaves parting the Red Sea and eventually correcting those who wish to worship the Golden Calf. The second half of the story centers on two brothers one good Richard Dix the other bad Rod La Rocque and both in love with the same woman Leatrice Joy. The bad brother ends up marrying the girl and becoming quite rich by breaking the law in his building contractor position but all of his sins are eventually going to catch up with him. This is certainly a strange mixture of a film because I was a little surprised to see DeMille spend most of its 136minute running time with the two brothers. The beginning stuff with Moses is pretty much just a prologue but it's a rather interesting one needless to say. While the special effects can't hold a candle to the eventual remake what we have here is still a treat for the eyes. The parting of the Red Sea certainly sticks out and while it's somewhat obvious how it was done the effect still holds up and manages to impress. The chariot crashes which were apparently real also stand out as does the large number of extras to carry out the Pharaoh scenes. Roberts a DeMille regular is pretty good in the role of Moses even though he comes off a tad bit too passionate. The second half of the film is rather hit and miss but for the most part I enjoyed it as well. The real standout here is the performance by Richard Dix who would of course go on to have an impressive career in film. He steals the film as the more timid brother who puts God before everything and his passion a deep one comes across very well with Dix hitting all the right notes. La Rocque is also devilishly good in his role and very believable as well. Joy makes for a good woman in the middle as well. Edythe Chapman another DeMille regular plays the boys mother but doesn't fair as good. Her character is so poorly written and over the top in her religious beliefs and demands that you can't help but start to hate her when she's suppose to be the one holding the family together. I wasn't impressed with the performance either but I'm going to guess much of this is more to do with the screenplay than anything else. The biggest problem with the film is that the second half is pretty common for the type of melodrama of the day. While it's told very well by DeMille it still comes off rather predictable and straight forward. With that said this 1923 silent still holds up quite well on all levels and folks should certainly check it out to see what DeMille would later remake. The director would fair better several years later with The King of Kings.".

It really does raise a lot of great questions as to how religion is still relevant today. How much can a person gain from reading the Bible?

	schema:reviewBody "This nine decadeold picture still remains a great surprise. Seemingly inferior to its glamorous remake today it occurs to have stood a test of time. But what comes to mind first is not the entire movie but its renowned prologue screenwriter Jeanie MacPherson's initial idea the action of which is set more than 3000 years ago when Children of Israel were led to freedom from bondage of false masters a unique answer to human cry for a better world. Made at the time when epics saw their beginnings and not being able to echo any earlier productions except for only few made in Italy or D.W. Griffith's INTOLERANCE Cecil B DeMille's silent TEN COMMANDMENTS was a highly new fresh screen experience. When the iconic screen Moses Charlton Heston was born Theodore Roberts as Chris Scott Edwards described him wildeyed ferocious and unkempt embodied the prophet for the first time in cinema and for the first time under DeMille. And unlike the 'greater than life' overlong 1956 remake which could have been titled MOSES' PHASES OF LIFE depicting a prince an exile a deliverer the lawgiver this 1923 version is actually THE TEN COMMANDMENTS because of its two parts where not 'laws' but 'the Law' as DeMille referred to it is truly at the core of its broadest appeal. Moreover due to the context it emerged from postGreat War period with Hollywood incidents like Fatty Arbuckle scandal mentioned by Katherine Orrison there was a need for a moral message through the medium. Therefore at the dawn of cinema Paramount was lucky to 'promote' the Decalogue and release a skillful combination of the Bible as its source DeMille as its deliverer and the roaring twenties as its initial addressee. Since The Exodus and the modern part can be treated as two separate films differently seen let me divide my review in a similar fashion.EXODUS. Lauded as quite the landmark of the director Sean Axmaker 2011 amazing with their sheer weirdness and scale filled with Vegasfeel to this sermon C.S Edwards DeMille's ultra drama of the ages Kyle Westphal it is not hard to agree with all the 'praise the work' opinions. Everything is spectacular about it including 500 carpenters 400 painters 600 chariots and its silent nature provides the movie with additional mystery. Because of its considerably short length it clearly corresponds to the intentions herein incorporated.

	onyx:emotionText "This nine decadeold picture still remains a great surprise. Seemingly inferior to its glamorous remake today it occurs to have stood a test of time. But what comes to mind first is not the entire movie but its renowned prologue screenwriter Jeanie MacPherson's initial idea the action of which is set more than 3000 years ago when Children of Israel were led to freedom from bondage of false masters a unique answer to human cry for a better world. Made at the time when epics saw their beginnings and not being able to echo any earlier productions except for only few made in Italy or D.W. Griffith's INTOLERANCE Cecil B DeMille's silent TEN COMMANDMENTS was a highly new fresh screen experience. When the iconic screen Moses Charlton Heston was born Theodore Roberts as Chris Scott Edwards described him wildeyed ferocious and unkempt embodied the prophet for the first time in cinema and for the first time under DeMille. And unlike the 'greater than life' overlong 1956 remake which could have been titled MOSES' PHASES OF LIFE depicting a prince an exile a deliverer the lawgiver this 1923 version is actually THE TEN COMMANDMENTS because of its two parts where not 'laws' but 'the Law' as DeMille referred to it is truly at the core of its broadest appeal. Moreover due to the context it emerged from postGreat War period with Hollywood incidents like Fatty Arbuckle scandal mentioned by Katherine Orrison there was a need for a moral message through the medium. Therefore at the dawn of cinema Paramount was lucky to 'promote' the Decalogue and release a skillful combination of the Bible as its source DeMille as its deliverer and the roaring twenties as its initial addressee. Since The Exodus and the modern part can be treated as two separate films differently seen let me divide my review in a similar fashion.EXODUS. Lauded as quite the landmark of the director Sean Axmaker 2011 amazing with their sheer weirdness and scale filled with Vegasfeel to this sermon C.S Edwards DeMille's ultra drama of the ages Kyle Westphal it is not hard to agree with all the 'praise the work' opinions. Everything is spectacular about it including 500 carpenters 400 painters 600 chariots and its silent nature provides the movie with additional mystery. Because of its considerably short length it clearly corresponds to the intentions herein incorporated.

	schema:reviewBody "The idea for KungFu Master was proposed by Jane Birkin in Agns Varda's tribute documentary to her Jane B. par Agns V. 1987. Birkin suggests a film in which a 40year old woman would fall hopelessly in love with a teenage boy suggesting herself and Varda's and Jacques Demy's son Mathieu for the leading roles. That very same year the idea would develop into the rapturing bewitching winning KungFu Master a film unlike any other ever made. MaryJane Birkin 40 divorced independent living with her two daughters her reallife daughters 16yearold Charlotte Gainsbourg and 5 yearold Lou Doillon suddenly finds herself terribly attracted to one of her daughter's schoolmates 14yearold Julien Mathieu Demy and viceversa. From then on MaryJane and Mathieu find the unlikeliest ways to meet including MaryJane bumping her car on Julien on purpose! as they face love's highs and lows trying to make it thrive against society's ponderous prejudices and Julien's own inevitable growing up.The film is a hoot from start to finish. The title is a reference to the Arcade video game where a KungFu Master must endlessly fight increasingly dangerous obstacles and enemies as must Julien and MaryJane to save his captive sweetheart who is kept tied up perennially crying for help. The opening sequence of the film in which Mathieu Demy in full KungFu costume skilfully simulates the robotic choreography of the video game hero is delightfully funny and wins you at once. The dialog sparkles with jeuxdemots and a mix of English and French sense of humor. Jane Birkin was probably never more beautiful or appealing than here her angular bony beauty serving her emotional transparency and complete commitment to her role. Mathieu Demy inexperienced is nevertheless charming wellcast and never phony in his difficult role. Varda's direction of her own son is amazing it looks as if she's discovering his acting potentialities and the first signs of manhood along with MaryJane and ourselves. The cast includes Birkin's family parents siblings nephews daughters etc who appear nonplussed with the touchy issue and ultimately even help the odd couple. Charlotte Gainsbourg shines with her urchin face special talent and sensibility she's a natural. Baby Lou Doillon is lovely throughout adding to the feeling of spontaneity that gives the whole film a slightly magical touch as if we were watching improvised scenes not scripted ones. MaryJane's and Julien's scenes together are far from risqu but filled with emotional rapture originality humor. Sex is implied but never at the core of things love  romantic throbbing unconventional love  is.KungFu Master is a fable about the nature and possibilities of romantic love in obtrusive circumstances and MAYBE it hints that women girls and boys are better suited for it than grownup men which is probably true!. When MaryJane and Julien go to a desert island so that they can fully experience their love far from society's burden we can see why they're at once sacred they're pure unbiased by interest conventions hypocrisy and doomed their love can only exist fully and freely away from conventional society. The film's ultimate goal may be to translate women's infinite inexhaustible talent for loving and teaching love regardless of how unlikely the object of their love is or how powerful the enemies or how complicated the obstacles women are the invincible undisputed KungFu Masters of love even ifwhen they don't win. This is arguably Varda's and Birkin's finest hour they have made a film that is a triumph of poetic sensibility filled with humor and intelligence it's a tribute to feminine pride no man could EVER make a film like this. Enchanting from start to finish always surprising never tacky or schmaltzy KungFu Master is a oneofakind film just waiting to be rediscovered  but most likely destined to be locked away in these hypocritical PC times of ours that furiously prevent renewed access to films as brave as this unless they're scandalous which KFM is not. If you can find it do see it by all means and pay special attention to the beautiful subtle rich finale. Beware though KungFu Master may be hazardous to your cynicism and conventionalism and may restart your belief in l'amour fou.".

Beyond the obvious metaphor of the game itself it spells out very clearly the lack of pretension in Varda's story of a fortyyear old housewife who falls in love with a fourteenyear old schoolboy. On its surface the film is about an older woman recapturing the passions of youth and a young boy's awkward reaching out toward maturity. But underneath is a thoughtful look at the erosion of oldfashioned romantic ideals in an age of safe sex and AIDS awareness a fact Varda gracefully acknowledges in the final chilling scene which in a subtle way shows the darkest side of adolescent peer pressure. It's a quiet undemonstrative drama Varda has a poet's sense of how much to say and how much to leave unsaid and the few remaining words she leaves in the capable hands of a firstrate cast. In a daring casting decision the director's own son handles the role of the teen lover and with surprising skill for a kid his age.".

This is a small exercise on context by Varda but as astute as ever.Varda seems to be parodying the notion that her film would have just a social relevance by having the AIDS scare of the time so prevalent throughout  the film is from the late 80s it evokes a distinct air of the time when youths crowded arcade parlors and TV segments on HIV sounded doom for mankind  or preempts it perhaps unsure herself if it's not unavoidably going to be that in the end.But see something else about the narrative horizon in which things acquire their significance.The woman who simply has these feelings one day that threaten to bring down everything in context of what she experiences it's a real affection for the boy it shakes her in earnest.

And isn't that this childish affection for the forbidden what intrinsically drives this story of a middleaged mother desiring a teenage boy?Anyway as it is with every good artist it's not all about poking a finger into the bloody wound. Varda proves her artistic maturity by cleverly making this a case study for much more abstract even universal questions. Just to mention a few When do we start desiring? What is the nature of paternal desire? Is it even erotic? Do we inevitably redeem our personal developmental lacks? In which form comes this redemption? And when is this form a perverted one?We get the idea. By picking out an obviously controversial topic to say the least Varda knowingly uses the polemic energy to be found on this end of the discursive spectrum. That's a bold seemingly provocative move. Everything else has been discussed portrayed exploited en masse. For instance we all know the tale of the mature man falling in love with the naive girl. But these stories are told just above the sharp line of social inacceptance and their drama is usually built on superficial mundanities that are easier to overlook. One could say Their cases are not socially unacceptable enough to be discussed indepth and pathologically.So is Varda making a case for genderalternative pedophilia? No at least not primarily. Really she points out that social social acceptance and on the other hand perversion go along the same linear continuum on which civilisation has left its categoricising marks. The necessity of having those remains undoubted. Varda makes this clear with the politically correct condemnation of her troubled female protagonist. In another case the case would be closed here. But this movie is not about moral codes and their lawful execution. It's about the emotional side effects that will always be the necessary evil more or less successfully suppressed. Not so much in the case of the protagonists The middleaged mother who openly suffers from an unfulfilled and incomplete youth. And the teenage boy whose puberty goes wild without the guidance of his absent parents.And Varda lets them express the suppressed the boy discovering sexuality and the mother doing the same the former for sheer curiosity the latter for belated redemption. Of course this love story was doomed to end in tragedy one in which the lovers metaphorically have to die. This is Varda's necessary evil A death not yet lived but necessary to be reborn for good.".

	schema:reviewBody "I found the film to be a very sensitive lowkey portrayal of a father having to learn to communicate with his children after his soldier wife is killed in Iraq. It is not political. Cusack's character is an uncritical believer in authority while his opposite number is shown as an immature oppositionist lacking grounding in the real world. In their political discussion both make valid points but neither view is the focus of the film. This is a family tale with the twist that it is a guy having to cope with losing a soldier spouse not a woman. Coping here means telling his children that their mother is gone and his struggle is not exactly new ground. Kramer vs Kramer is the obvious example of a father learning how to cope with fatherhood. Grace however shows a pretty decently coping Dad from the gitgo. His struggle is more focused. Unable to bear telling his daughters the bad news and unable to face it himself he takes them on a fantasy trip to a Disneyworld standin driving from Minnesota to Florida. As with most road trips this is a journey of discovery for him and particularly for his older 12yearold daughter. Ultimately he finds the voice in which to speak the painful words. Cusack is masterful in his portrayal of the struggling widower. The young actresses playing his daughters are completely convincing. One thing that stands out is the minimalist Clint Eastwood score. It supports the sorrowful tale and seems almost to be trying to sooth the grieving father. This is not a cheery feel good flick in which everyone goes home with a smile on but it is a satisfying film that offers a realistic portrayal of regular people coping with a very harsh reality.".

	schema:reviewBody "John Cusack is one of the character actors I admire. And in Grace is Gone it centers upon his ability to bring you into his character's world. He really transformed himself into the role of Stanley Philipps with his thick glasses walking with an instep and that little hunch and a paunch and delivers probably one of his finer touches in disappearing into a character that's so everyday average joe. He's a salaryman earning his keep while watching over his two girls while Mrs Grace Philipps Dana Lynne Gilhooley is a career soldier who gets her tour of duty in Iraq.The crux of the entire story laid on the premise of Stanley trying to find the appropriate moment to tell his children about the unfortunate demise of their mother while at the same time fighting hard to accept the bitter truth that the woman he loves is gone. More so of course when it is revealed later some things that can no longer be reversed in time which makes it all the more sad and regrettable.But we also learn more about Stanley through the eyes of his children when they throw the occasional tantrum or have issues to deal with. Shelan O'Keefe as Heidi the older daughter is a remarkable actress lending some gravitas to her role when it called for it and holds her own opposite Cusack very well. Gracie Bednarczyk as younger daughter Dawn I guess was just being herself injecting much needed effervescence to counter the heavy drama that circulates throughout the movie.Besides some expected and really moving scenes in the movie some from plot devices while others from the characters themselves writerdirector James C. Strouse also managed to sneak in a comment or two about War and Truth which is what we make it up to be most of the time. Alessandro Nivola also turned in a rather short but nice performance behind that heavily bearded appearance as the brother of Stanley and the children's uncle.If I need another plus point to recommend Grace is Gone then it will be the score by Clint Eastwood yes what a surprise when the end credits rolled punctuating the story neatly when it called for it. All in all a story without any major plot twists since the title already said it all simple yet effective and hinged very much on excellent acting to bring the characters to life.".

	schema:reviewBody "Grace is Gone is a very sad but important film. Until I read about it on IMDb I had no idea that it was being made. Very subtley it slipped in and out of theaters. Finally I found it at Blockbuster and picked it up to watch with my family. At the end my family remarked on how sad the movie is. They are very right with this comment. In fact this may be one of the saddest but beautiful films I've ever seen. It takes a situation that every parent may face and turns it into a beautiful story about family and love.Stanley Phillips is a dad taking care of his two daughters while their wife and mother Grace is in Iraq in the Army.

	onyx:emotionText "Grace is Gone is a very sad but important film. Until I read about it on IMDb I had no idea that it was being made. Very subtley it slipped in and out of theaters. Finally I found it at Blockbuster and picked it up to watch with my family. At the end my family remarked on how sad the movie is. They are very right with this comment. In fact this may be one of the saddest but beautiful films I've ever seen. It takes a situation that every parent may face and turns it into a beautiful story about family and love.Stanley Phillips is a dad taking care of his two daughters while their wife and mother Grace is in Iraq in the Army.

	schema:headline " Have Grace on Cusack! Give this man an Oscar already!";
	schema:reviewBody "My goodness gracious! John Cusack has to be one of the most underrated actors in the history of cinema. He has graced us with his witty banter and thespian charisma in such classics as Say Anything High Fidelity Bullets Over Broadway The Grifters Being John Malkovich and Grosse Pointe Blank. To think that this legendary actor has never been nominated for an Oscar is unbearable to deal with! I accuse the Academy for having a case of the Cusack Snubbing Syndrome. In Grace is Gone the inevitable occurred again! Cusack delivered another worthy Oscar nominated performance and once again the Academy snubbed Johnny C. In the film Cusack plays Stanley Phillips a home supply manager and father of two young girls. Stanley's wife Grace is a Sergeant in the U.S. Army who is killed in Iraq on duty. Stanley now has the painful duty of telling his young daughters Heidi  Dawn that their mom has passed. Stanley temporarily passes on the aforementioned duty and decides instead to take his daughters on a road trip to their favorite amusement park Enchanted Gardens. The acting of Grace is Gone was on duty! I already mentioned the brilliance of Cusack! In Grace is Gone he plays Stanley as a man who rightfully loves his country and believes in honoring your duty but also as a loving father who authentically grieves for his wife's passing. Shelan O' Keefe and Gracie Bednarczyk also delivered genuine roles as the Phillips' girls. And I especially enjoyed another underrated actor Alessandro Nivola's performance as Stanley's antiwar but caring brother John. The only pitfall of Grace is Gone was its spontaneous dreary scenes. First time WriterDirector James Strouse's effort was somewhat commendable but it is evident that he is a rookie filmmaker and in due time the disgrace of Strouse's overextended scenes will be gone in his signature direction. Nevertheless I do recommend Grace is Gone! Why you ask? Mostly because of the Cusack!  Average".

If we wanted to watch movies where characters laid out their thoughts verbatim we wouldn't have an opportunity to infer our own emotions on the situation. I would have been upset if this filmed decided to tackle the issue of war instead of the issue of how modern loss can effect us. This is a film about being put on pause. When we are shaken out of our sense of normalcy how do we cope. In this case how do you explain the loss you cannot comprehend to your children. I think that this film is powerful in it's absent of the affectation of the outside world. You have a man who insulates himself from the events and in that case you have something a lot more honest. If the film had chosen to attack those issues i think the depth of loss would have been shattered. This isn't an antiwar nor prowar film. I think that if you go in expecting that you will dislike immensely. This is a film about normalcy and our failure to cope. I think it works. I think wanting it to do something it isn't trying to do is an incorrect way to view this film.".

It has so many human elements that I believe will make it a very important film for many years to come. It does not take a political stance. It is about life. The loss of life and the effects of war. It does not force you to take a political stance just a look at your own humanity and how you might deal with the tragic loss of a loved one. I am the first person to go and see a high budget action film and turn my brain off to enjoy but some times its nice to leave your brain on in a movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Looking for a good tearjerker? You could hardly find one better than GRACE IS GONE. Topical. Family oriented. It is something of a surprising role for John Cusack who started his career with lowbrow comedies BETTER OFF DEAD and ONE CRAZY SUMMER. But this independent gem shows that Cusack has the wherewithal to spot a solid dramatic part and run with it. Although Cusack has done some offandon standup work things like THE ICE HARVEST and PUSHING TIN were a bit thin on character. But not so here.And even more surprising the film brings two unknowns to play alongside Cusack. The two are also very young girls who show that Dakota Fanning CHARLOTTE'S WEB isn't the only young gal who can act her heart out. Shlan O'Keefe stars as Heidi Phillips Stanley Phillips' Cusack's eldest daughter and does so with astonishing ...um ...grace. Trying to find her way into adolescence while watching her father implode is quite nicely portrayed. Her first attempts at smoking and her nighttime wanderings are something many parents will be able to identify with.Stanley's younger daughter Dawn is played by newcomer Gracie Bednarczyk and her portions where she's jousting with her older sister are spot on. Not understanding what's happening to their family is significant in that someone of her age truly wouldn't know. But the suspicions of her elder sister set her on edge ...just a tad.Grace is Gone is a very good war film. And by war I mean a film that focuses on its impact on the homefront. When Stanley Cusack learns of his wife's death in Iraq it takes some mental juggling for him to come to terms with what that means for him and his two young daughters. This is the crux of the story. When Stanley can't release the information to his kids he hides it by taking them to a fun theme park many miles away. It seems he wants his kids to have fun before breaking the worst news of their lives to them ...and in a sense rebreaking it to himself. Stanley loses sight of what he needs to do and even becomes a bit delusional he calls his own home to tell his deadwife that he and the kids are okay etc..The gutwrenching scene when Stanley MUST tell the kids what happened to their mother is one of the hardest things any parent will ever have to watch. The musical score comes up over the voice of Stanley and we don't get to hear everything he says which we don't need to we can see it on the children's' faces. A truly powerful moment that will linger with you for many days if not weeks.It is noteworthy to mention how topical this film is since the war in Iraq seems far from over. Men and women continue to die over there and when that might end is anyone's guess. But one thing is for certain the traumas felt over there definitely ripple over to here. And that's something that this film shows us exceptionally well.".

It is true that the film is centered on the death of Cusack's wife rather than the manner of it but that's what makes it more compelling and heartrending. The film is all about Iraq because it shows the fallout of the war for one family. There is a fair bit of commentary as well it is simply subtle. The film deals with issues of patriotism and what that means to different people ego and sacrifice and of course how do you tell your children mommy isn't coming home? Cusack did an absolutely brilliant job portraying this tense hunched man and allowing the audience to see him grow a little bit in selfawareness throughout the film. There is no hugely dramatic moment when he screams 'my whole life has been based on a misconception!' but it's also hard to imagine that he hasn't begun to move away from his old belief system. It's not hard to portray someone who is coming unglued loudly it is hard to create a subtle character and touch the audience with his pain and self. I thought Cusack's decision to physically play the character as he did was really interesting. Cusack is a big man and his character is meant to be exmilitary himself so it would be obvious to play him fairly macho and strident. Instead Cusack plays him as this gawky physically 'small' and fumbling man with a soft though firm voice and manner. Really interesting.".

How many of us watching this will connect in someway to something who knows but for me I did. The mundane cloud that has set onto the screen shows a man with dampened spirit and little reason to smile is he the epitome of middle America who knows? Sadly things don't get much better when two uniformed soldiers turn up at his door to inform him of his wife's death in Iraq. This scene is particularly cold and had me in sympathetic mode as I watched them try and console Cusack in the same robotic manner that Cusack had shown his colleagues earlier on. A signed form later and the soldiers where gone it is from here that things really begin.To deal with the loss of partner is heart breaking but to have to inform his two daughters seems presently unthinkable. Cusack decides he needs time to console and takes the girls off on a road trip to Florida. As they drive through suburb after suburb you cant help but notice their grid like environment consisting of brand name stores  lifeless roadside diners churning out the same conventional foods.Grace is Gone unfolds in such a refreshingly organic way and is nicely produced to capture a world so routine so grey and so convincing. Within this encapsulation we have a mixture of tender  thoughtful moments sparked by unselfish actions and of course the moment Cusack communicates the awful truth to his daughters. The key roles are obviously granted to Cusack and the girls with only a small supporting cast everything is well delivered and full of purpose. However the joy of this film is not in the theme itself but in the simplicity of it's presentation and the sense of realism which feels as true as life itself.Grace is Gone is by no means a classic however it did make me think and it did leave me touched unlike any other film from the Iraq genre. It is for these reason's that I recommend this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this at the Traverse City Film Festival.Grace is Gone stars John Cusack as a husband whose wife has just been killed in Iraq. He doesn't have the courage to tell his two young daughters that their mother has died so instead he decides to take them on a road trip perhaps not to just make it easier on the girls but to make it easier for himself.This film was pretty good but I felt it was flat at parts and some tears were forced. It didn't have as much emotion as I thought it would have. John Cusack does a great job acting in the film but most of the time his character is just trying to hide the sadness from his daughters. Some scenes drag on and others don't seem to really fit in with the rest of the story.My favorite scene in the film takes place in a store and involves the younger daughter wandering off on her own. The scene is so subtle and the drama isn't as obvious as other parts in the film but it's quite an emotional scene. I wish the rest of the film had moments like that.Politics aren't really discussed much in the film at least not as much as I thought there was going to be. However when it does it goes with the typical clich of family members differing in beliefs and trying to get their own point across. People will probably be interested in this film because of the subject matter and the modern storyline but apart from the cause of death of the wife the war is never really mentioned. In a way that's why this film doesn't work at times. Apart from the one scene with his antiwar brother Cusack's character never gets a chance to express his emotions and regrets because he's always with his children.Nonetheless as a film about a father trying to reveal to his children the death of their mother it's a good film. But if you're seeing the film because it involves the war in Iraq you'll be disappointed because the war is hardly mentioned.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie won the Audience Award for dramatic film at Sundance 2007 and a screen writing award but I found it to be the most disappointing and shallow of the films I saw at the festival. John Cusack gives a great performance as Stanley a father who's trying to figure out how to tell his two daughters 8 and 12 that their mother has been killed in the Iraq War. The movie is a bigtime tearjerker but aside from the broadstroke melodrama I found it to be emotionally vacant.We're never given any real indication of what's going on in Stanley's head. At one point his hippie dropout brother Stanley is a conservative war supporter provides some helpful exposition about Cusack and his late wife but the writerdirector never seems to have heard of the show don't tell rule. The only concrete demonstrations of Stanley's distress we ever get are a series of shots of him staring into space. We never find out if Stanley's political beliefs have been challenged or strengthened by his experience or whether his belief that his wife died fighting a just cause made it any easier or harder to cope with his loss.In fact the movie seems to have decided to portray Stanley's emotional confusion by not having him express any emotion at all and the only insight we gather is that it's really really really really really hard to tell your children that their mother has died.And in the end any tears generated are not due to any particular skill in writing or directing but simply because of the audience's reaction to how horrible it is for ANY parent to have to tell their young children that their other parent has died. To me that's a cheat the movie doesn't provide any sort of insight into Stanley's feelings and relies on the audience to provide all the emotion. Cusack supplies a fine performance with the limited material he's been given as do the two daughters but this movie doesn't supply much else besides cheap tears. Watch for it to become a monster hit and pick up a basket of Oscar nominations.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's hard to dramatize a man who can't talk. In Grace Is Gone Stanley Philips John Cusack is such a man. Stanley learns that his wife has died in Iraq and cannot bring himself to tell his two little girls 12yearold Heidi Shlan O'Keefe and 8yearold Dawn Gracie Bednarczyk. This is a sensitive wellacted tale with terrific work by Cusack and the girls but it's rather excruciating to watch. The movie is a long slow wait for the moment when the father finally finds the courage to tell his daughters about the tragic event.Cusack is remarkable especially in the early scenes where we see him as a manager of a bigbox home supplies store plodding bespectacled ordinary even his walk bespeaks disappointment and lowered expectations. He had lousy eyesight but cheated to get into the Army because he wanted so badly to serve. Later his deception was discovered and he was expelled but in basic training he met his wife Grace who has been sent to Iraq leaving Stanley behind with the girls. He's grumpy with them bossy in a way that might work better for a couple of boys but mostly reflecting a depression and guilt he can't admit to. He pretends everything is okay but in the opening he is awkwardly attending a military wives' support for women in his place left behind while their spouses are in harm's way in the Middle East.He can't speak even then. When the two soldiers come to the door with the bad news he at first won't let them in. And he refuses their help and just sits.It goes on like that. Stanley takes the girls out of school avoiding his job driving to Enchanted Gardens in Florida. It's a long detour around the elephant in the room. For the audience it's an increasingly painful and tedious wait suspense over a moment that will only be the beginning of the real story of coping with grief such as was depicted for instance in Nanni Moretti's film The Son's Room.On the way south Stanley detours to visit their grandmother's house and instead finds his younger brother John Alexander Nivola a bearded smoking unemployed high school dropout working on his GRE and thinking of law or medical school. John is an angry and honest 32yearold who provokes a political conflict. He calls Bush your monkey President and shows himself to be violently opposed to the Iraq war. Stanley insists it is noble to serve. He will not hear of anything else and stifles the girls when John asks their opinion. Is the movie saying one reason for Stanley's implosion is that what's happened calls all his patriotism into question and that his noncommunication with the girls comes from his rigid politics? Heidi also is a doubter or a worrier. It emerges that she has not been sleeping at night. When she calls school to tell them they're away she meets understanding and pity. The subtlety of first director Strause's screenplay is the delicacy with which he hints at the suspicions of the older girl and perhaps of the younger girl as well. Before the moment of truth arrives it's more and more clear that nobody thinks anything is okay.Grace Is Gone is a sensitive movie but it goes weak in key places. Strause cuts the sound in the revelatory scene just when Stanley gets to the hardest part of telling the girls the truth. The film in effect cops out just the way the father has been doing all along. In the end the film turns into a Hallmark card. We and the accomplished cast deserved better.".

Shlan O'Keefe and Gracie Bednarczyk are superb as the two daughters who are respectively confused and unaware and growing up. Alessandro Nivola does a fine job in a brief role as Stanley's brother who shares the opposite viewpoint on politics.I liked that here there wasn't a lot of focus on the landscape not that would have minded that because Strouse stays focused on the three key characters.

At the end of the film he drives to a secluded beach and delivers the tragic news as best he can it is then that his two little girls react in uncontrollable tears as you will too.A first rate gentle movie. 10 stars easily.

Strouse made a sober work which is completely at tone with the storywhile as a screenwriterhe could get a precise balance between emotions and narrative at the same time he exposed the subject of the war on a provocative way.I will look forward to seeing Strouse's next movies.The only complain I have against this movie is that it felt a little bit dull on a specific moment.In spite of thatI recommend Grace Is Gone with a lot of enthusiasm.I did not have too big expectations with itand I finished taking a great surprise.".

The lead character Stanley played by John Cusack is an exArmy member who loved the opportunity to serve his country but was finally discharged because of poor eyesight dealing with the fact that his wife who is still in the US Army has been sent to Iraq. While serving in Iraq his wife is killed in the line of duty. Stanley is angry because he was discharged and felt that it was his duty and HONOR to serve his country in Iraq but his wife is doing so instead. Now the unthinkable has happened. His wife has been killed in the line of duty. Now Stanley has to deal with the humiliation of his wife serving instead of him losing his wife and having to tell his two daughters that their mother is not coming home. this is where the story departs from the specific circumstances of this plot line. Now it is just a father trying to figure out how to tell his two daughters their mother is dead. John Cusack does an outstanding job in portraying this character. As an Air Force retiree husband of an Air Force member and a father of three children I fully understand that it would be easier to go to war and DIE than to tell my children that their mother is not coming home. I completely empathized with John's character and understood his complete denial in dealing with the task. This is an excellent portrayal and my accolades to the three main characters who played the parts of father and daughters. I especially appreciated that the producers and director had the good sense not to interject politics either left or right into this movie and just let the story stand on its own. This film is a must see and I highly recommend it to all.".

He tells his guests of his travels in his time machine the work about which his friends knew. They were also unbelieving and skeptical of any practical use if it did indeed work. George knew that his machine was stationary in geographic position but he did not account for changes in what happens over time to that location. He also learns that the machine is not impervious and he is not immune to those who do not understand him or the machine's purpose. George tells his friends that he did not find the Utopian society he so wished had developed. He mentions specifically a civilization several thousand years into the future which consists of the subterranean morlocks and the surface dwelling eloi who on first glance lead a carefree life. Despite all these issues love can still bloom over the spread of millennia.";

This film exemplifies that attitude.I first saw The Time Machine as a 10 year old in 1970 and was utterly captivated. The stopmotion photography was spellbinding to me particularly when George kills one of the attacking Morlocks. The gory footage of the body decomposing will abide with me forever. More importantly and for the first time in my life I was completely swept away with the concept of time travel.

	schema:reviewBody "Boy did a nice DVD transfer of this not only mak me appreciate the visuals in here more but made the story seem better too for some reason. I only acquired the DVD as a memento so to speak. I had to have at least one movie which had the woman I had a crush on back in the early '60s Yvettte Mimieux. She still looks great too. The main thing however is how I now viewed this story and how much more I wound up liking it than in the past. This was my fourth look at this movie over a 45year span and I enjoyed it the most this last time. Since time travel stories always fascinate me my favorite part of the film is when George Rod Taylor is actually in his time machine and experiments with it slowing it down here and then and then stopping it a couple of times to observe World War I and then WWII. Then he stops in 1966 when supposedly there was a nuclear attack. Apparently scaremongers back in '60 thought that was a shortterm likelihood.Anyway when George H.G. Wells the author of this story finally stops in the year 200000something the story loses some of its momentum. However it's a fairly interesting study of a group of ultrapassive people being dominated by others who live underground and then literally eat the good people. Taylor is astounded that mankind has not progressed as he had figured but seemed to have regressed.The message I got on this last look is that man is still man meaning sinful and capable of anything bad as well as good and to put one's faith totally in man is a mistake. It's only going to lead to disappointments as George found out on each of his stops. Notice he never stopped during a peaceful progressive period. Yet George is still an optimist and wants to be one to help initiate change for the better. There's always hope for a better world and people like George with his idealism put to action can make a difference.Overall an entertaining and thoughtprovoking film.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the early 1960s my mother used to take my younger sister and me to a nearby onescreen theater to see Saturday kiddie matinees. It was a great way to keep us entertained and out of her hair for a few hours particularly after our baby sister was born.One movie I saw during those matinees was the 1960 version of The Time Machine. It made such an impression on me that for quite a while afterward I would play Time Machine with my sister and cousin with me as the Time Traveler.It wasn't until sometime in the 1990s that I was able to see it again when I got a VHS copy. It was very much the way I remembered it to be. I have since read the book and have found that the movie is quite faithful to the text though some scenes involving two stops in the 1900s were added and a few bright spots appeared that weren't in the book which is pretty dark.The special effects look primitive by today's standards but they did win the Academy Award for Special Effects in 1961 and rightfully so though I have no idea what other films had been nominated.This is still one of my top 10 movies and likely always will be. I haven't seen the 2002 version which is probably just as well since I'm happy with the 1960 version and don't want to ruin it.".

	schema:headline " George Pal Realizes His Vision";
	schema:reviewBody "In 1960 filmmaker George Pal brought to fruition a visionary concept for a film based on a novel by H.G. Wells about an inventor who builds a machine that enables him to travel through time specifically into the future where he learns a timeless universal truth about the machinations of society and some of the basic tenets of human nature.  The Time Machine' which Pal produced and directed stars Rod Taylor as George the inventortime travelerhero who born into a time and world that doesn't suit him decides to do something about it.  A week into the 20th Century four of George's closest friends Dr. Philip Hillyer Sebastian Cabot Anthony Bridewell Tom Helmore Walter Kemp Whit Bissell and his best friend David Filby Alan Young are gathered at his house for dinner but George is late when he finally shows up he is disheveled disoriented and hungry and has a story that is beyond belief. It's a tale that actually began one week earlier on New Year's Eve 1899 when the five had last been together.  On that evening George after a discussion of the reality of a Fourth Dimension' had given them a demonstration of a model of a Time Machine' he had built a miniature prototype of the machine he hoped would take him some day into the future. His demonstration is met with interest but skepticism only Filby it seems is able to keep an open mind but even he encourages George to accept the constraints of Time which to the rational mind are absolute and immutable.  George however views Time as a parameter a variable whose value is subject to change.  And on that last night of the 19th Century after his friends leave gone off to celebrate the arrival of the new century George acts on his theory by stepping into his machine and beginning a journey that will prove to be the adventure of a lifetime.  A journey during which he sees a number of wars and changes in the world around him and which ultimately transports him some 800000 years into the future where he finds a world ravaged by fate where humankind has been divided into two sects  The gentle Eloi living on the surface of the earth and the Morlocks mutants who dwell beneath as the Master Race and who prey upon the weak and simple Eloi.He also discovers the dark secret of the Eloi and the Morlocks and determines to address the situation.  But first he returns to his own time to tell his friends the story and to retrieve something he needs.  When his guests leave Filby remains behind with words of caution for George but as soon as he leaves George is off to fulfill his destiny and he has all the time in the world to do it.Going into this project George Pal had a definite vision of what he wanted to accomplish with this film from the way the time machine itself looked to the way he wanted to present the future of mankind and the world.  And working from the intelligent imaginative screenplay by David Duncan he succeeded by delivering a film that has since become a classic of the Science Fiction genre.  The nature of the story demands that the viewer suspend disbelief of course but Pal develops his story in such a plausible straightforward manner that it is easy to do just that.  He puts George on the journey of a lifetime and he takes his audience along for the ride.  He does an exquisite job of establishing the Victorian era in which the story begins as well as the world of the Eloi and the Morlocks.  The FX he employs to convey the sense of George's movement through time like the swift arcing of the Sun and Moon and the quick subtle and sometimes notsosubtle changes George observes are entirely effective.  Pal obviously had a devotion to detail that pays off handsomely here.  A dedicated filmmaker he refused to settle for less than what he knew was right for his picture and it shows.  The result is a film that is entertaining timeless and memorable.As George Rod Taylor is perfectly cast and gives a solid performance in which he embodies the boldness the imagination and tenacity of his character.  Most importantly he makes George believable and his motivations credible which enables the viewer to be swept along with the story.  Taylor has a commanding presence that serves his character well and he is in fact the veritable personification of the exploreradventurer a man willing to take a chance or face unbelievable odds to accomplish his goal. Taylor is a fine actor who has made a number of movies but of them all this is the role for which he will probably be best remembered.Also perfect in her role is Yvette Mimieux as one of the Eloi Weena.  A talented actress now something of a 60s icon in fact her fair beauty along with the innocent demeanor and vulnerability she manages to convey makes her character entirely convincing.  And the way she plays it makes George's actions more likely as well.  Granted her character is well written to begin with but Mimieux's the one who sells it in the translation from page to screen.  The supporting cast includes Doris Lloyd Mrs. Watchett Bob Barran Eloi Man James Skelly Second Eloi Man and Paul Frees Voice of the Talking Rings.  A transporting flight of fantasy expertly crafted and imaginatively presented The Time Machine' is captivating entertainment that will make you believe that time travel is possible.  it paints a bleak picture of the future to be sure but it gives you and leaves you with that which has kept Man putting one foot in front of the other since Time began Hope.  That's the legacy of H.G. Wells and the promise of George Pal.  And it's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 810.".

	schema:reviewBody "I recently saw the 2002 film The Time Machine and liked it a great deal so I thought that it was probably in my best interest to see the 1960 version of The Time Machine.  So I went ahead and rented it and watched it.  I knew that this film was made in 1960 so I wasn't expecting anything spectacular but I still hoped that it would be good.  I must say that I was REALLY impressed with the film!  I thought it was great!The story is brilliantly told smartly done and quite interesting.  I noticed a great deal of similarities and differences between this film and the 2002 version.  There was virtually nothing I didn't like about the film as far as story goes.  I'm really interested in reading the H.G. Wells story now so hopefully in the near future I'll bust out my copy and read it.I thought the actors in the film did a fantastic job as well!  Sadly I'd never even heard of any of the actors in the film.  I thought Rod Taylor Alan Young and Yvette Mimieux all did a great job.  The rest of the cast was good but these three really struck me as great.  Also I have to say that Yvette is one beautiful woman!The special effects in this film were surprisingly good especially for a movie made in 1960!  I must admit that I was really impressed with the sets and the special effects in the film.The only thing that I would complain about if I had to is some little things.  For instance the classic monster about to grab the guy but then doesn't sort of thing.  Little things like that kind of bothered me but I realize that it was just the style back then so I can't really complain about it.  Also I wasn't too terribly impressed with the mouth and face of the Morlocks but again given that it was made back in 1960 I can let it slide.Overall I really enjoyed the film and would definitely recommend it to anyone that liked the 2002 version of the film or just enjoys films about timetravel or science fiction.  I truly hope that you enjoy the film as much as I do.  Thank you for readingChris".

	schema:reviewBody "One of my favorite films back when I was a lad was George Pal's production of the H.G. Wells novel The Time Machine. As I've gotten a lot older since the 13 I was when it came out I can more appreciate the meticulous care that went into the making of this film.Considering that we didn't have computer generated images back in the day the special effects hold up remarkably well. The make up and costumes for the villainous Morlocks still have the power to frighten.What I look at now though was the United Kingdom of the turn of the last century in which Wells wrote his book. As much as George Pal was able to capture the future he did as well with the past the recreation of the VictorianEdwardian era from which our time traveler Rod Taylor goes to the future and back.A lot of that has to do with the casting of the four men who are Taylor's friends and looked like they stepped from that era. Tom Helmore Sebastian Cabot Whit Bissell and Alan Young all comport themselves as proper English gentlemen who are concerned and support their friend anyway in his theories and experiments.Especially Alan Young's performance it's my favorite in the film. Young plays a dual role as Taylor's friend and as his own son over several generations of the 20th century. He's the kind of true friend we should all in life be fortunate to have.Also note that the mechanics of the Time Machine itself are never explained just how the thing works and what powers it. It was probably beyond even the fertile imagination of H.G. Wells to conceive our own best minds of science now debate whether it is even theoretically possible.Rod Taylor after playing several good supporting roles in many films since arriving in America from his native Australia got his first lead and real big break in The Time Machine. He's excellent as the time traveler who essentially saves the future for mankind and rescues it from the world that has developed.The Time Machine was also ahead of it's time. no pun intended in its depiction of the peaceful Eloi. During the sixties age of flower power the gentle Eloi are like a bunch of hippies who seemingly have attained their version of paradise. No one is old and they live in a garden of Eden. Little do they know what the underground Morlocks are using them for.Yvette Mimieux who as Weena of the Eloi got her break out role her. She's the quintessence of the flower power generation soon to come.Even though new versions have been done this version of The Time Machine still stirs the imagination and appeals to the scientifically curious in all of us.".

Tom Helmore Sebastian Cabot Whit Bissell and Alan Young all comport themselves as proper English gentlemen who are concerned and support their friend anyway in his theories and experiments.Especially Alan Young's performance it's my favorite in the film. Young plays a dual role as Taylor's friend and as his own son over several generations of the 20th century. He's the kind of true friend we should all in life be fortunate to have.Also note that the mechanics of the Time Machine itself are never explained just how the thing works and what powers it. It was probably beyond even the fertile imagination of H.G. Wells to conceive our own best minds of science now debate whether it is even theoretically possible.Rod Taylor after playing several good supporting roles in many films since arriving in America from his native Australia got his first lead and real big break in The Time Machine. He's excellent as the time traveler who essentially saves the future for mankind and rescues it from the world that has developed.The Time Machine was also ahead of it's time. no pun intended in its depiction of the peaceful Eloi. During the sixties age of flower power the gentle Eloi are like a bunch of hippies who seemingly have attained their version of paradise. No one is old and they live in a garden of Eden. Little do they know what the underground Morlocks are using them for.Yvette Mimieux who as Weena of the Eloi got her break out role her. She's the quintessence of the flower power generation soon to come.Even though new versions have been done this version of The Time Machine still stirs the imagination and appeals to the scientifically curious in all of us.";

	schema:reviewBody "In isolation this film is an interesting and rather enjoyable tale.  It is only when you appreciate the underlying theme in the original 1895 novel penned by H.G. Wells that you discovers how the story had been laundered to be politically correct for American public release.  In a land where socialism has almost always been a dirty word and at a time when the McCarthy political witch hunts that hit Hollywood rather badly were still a fresh memory and when the Cold War was at its height M.G.M. Studios was not going to take the risk of preaching a cautionary story about how the seeds sown by the capitalist system could exact a gruesome nemesis in a distant future.  Instead the studio took the story stripped it of its ideology and presented it as the adventure of a gifted Victorian inventor.Throughout his career Herbert George Wells 18661946 placed his sympathies with the working class.  In 1905 he joined the Fabian Society a socialist thinktank whose ranks included George Bernard Shaw and that gave birth to the British Labour Party.  It is not surprising that his ideology would embed itself in his writing  and this was certainly true of his first novel The Time Machine.  The book tells of an enterprising inventor who crafts a device that can carry a human passenger forward or backward through time.  The hero travels 800000 years into the future and finds a world in which humans had evolved into two species an illiterate and childlike race called the Eloi devoid of technology but similar in appearance to modern humans who inhabited the surface of the planet and the more repugnant Morlocks technologically sophisticated and living in perpetual darkness in underground caverns.  The hero gradually learns that it is the Morlocks who supply the Eloi with food clothing and other basic necessities of life but they exact a terrible price.  At periodic intervals the Morlocks harvest the Eloi for food.By his own drive Wells who lived an impoverished childhood and became literate only in his teen years entered university where he studied biology under Thomas H. Huxley the illustrious and outspoken champion of Charles Darwin.  He was aware of the debates among evolutionary biologists of his day over the discovery of Neanderthal remains about how two distinct species of humans  Neanderthals and our CroMagnon ancestors  existed in a prehistoric Europe and whether it was a peaceful coexistence or whether the two species competed perhaps violently for control of resources. Wells merely extrapolated the concept of two competing human species to a distant future.The hero in the novel also discovers how this world came into being.  At some less remote future time the industrialists collectively chose to establish their factories and means of production underground leaving the surface of the earth green.  Eventually the politically powerful classes decided to banish all workers underground as well leaving the world of sunshine and blue skies as a playground for the wealthy and the privileged  a paradise that would eventually turn sour when the passage of time would adjust the genetic makeup of the two classes in their different environments and when a successful slave revolt would place the descendants of the workers in control.Clearly such a political fable could not be put on screen in the United States in 1960.  If a cinematic version of the story was going to be made another explanation had to be conjured up to account for the evolution of the two human species  and it was found in the Cold War itself a war that turns hot and forces huge populations underground for survival.  Toady however almost forty years after the movie was released and more than a hundred hears since the novel first broke onto the world that M.G.M. explanation seems horribly dated and it is the original Wells plot that holds up much better in today's international political and industrial climate.".

Photography and Cinematography are excellent as well and the acting is believable for the story. The departure from the book comes at the end when George returns to the future to help the Eloi and Weena. An interesting point if the film which was made for 750000.00 in 35 days is that Yvette Mimieux was only 17 years old at the time the shooting began and turned 18 during the filming. Violence is minor and profanity is nonexistent in this George Pal classic and there should be no problem allowing the children to watch.

	schema:reviewBody "George Pal's The Time Machine was filmed fifty years ago but still remains an enjoyable film to watch. The plot is well known so I won't rehash too much. Simply enough the movie sees the protagonist George travel into the future. After a few stops in the 20th century being encased in a mountain forces him 800000 plus years into the future. He meets the Eloi a peaceful people and later their captors the Morlocks. George helps the Eloi including his love interest Weena to escape from their doomed existence.I often read a lot of criticism of this film. It's not like the book or the special effects aren't good enough anymore are the chief complaints. Why does that matter? The movie is fine without being like the book. As far as the FX go. They're fine for 1960 but really this movie is not about how real it looks but about the characters. And that's where it excels.GeorgeRod Taylor is everything a man should be. He craves new facts and strives for knowledge. He also is not afraid to stand up for himself or those he cares for. He freely admits wrong and apologizes for transgressions. In short he's a great person almost too good to be true. Rod Taylor plays him perfectly.In the future George meets WeenaYvette Mimieux one of the Eloi. The Eloi are passive to the point of complacency and Weena is no exception but she quickly responds to George. Their romance blossoms but not too much. Most is left to our imagination when George returns to the future at the end of the movie. At first glance it may seem that Yvette Mimieux portrays Weena as a vacuous airhead but as I watch this movie I spot a lot of subtle things that make her acting job very good. She is physical with George but it's done subtly like an innocent girl would do it. For instance when they go see the talking rings Weena seems to be very amused with George's curiosity. She laughs takes his hand and pulls him along. Later she baits him into touching her when she asks him to put her hair up and then turns to him for close affection. Mimieux does a very good job of giving Weena a balance of innocence and budding sexuality.Also worth mentioning is Alan Young as Filby. He avoids the stuffy behavior of the others of George's group and keeps a sense of wonder about him. Young gives a convincing portrayal.When I was a kid my Dad was a scifi buff so I saw lots of the old classics. War of the Worlds Forbidden Planet and The Thing were often watched by me but The Time Machine is my favorite. When I saw it as a teen I was fascinated with a postapocalyptic future and this movie has that. But when I see it as an adult I'm more moved by the characters. George has a sense of adventure about him that keeps me interested in him. Of course Weena kept my interest as a teen and as an adult male for different reasons but I won't sell Yvette Mimieux short as an actress. She does a great job.See this movie and avoid the cynicism that has affected movie goers today. I know you'll love it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rod Taylor boards a contraption he built and goes forward in history in The Time Machine a 1960 film also starring Alan Young as Filby Yvette Mimieux Sebastian Cabot and Whit Bissell.Taylor plays George who is in actuality H.G. Wells who wrote the book on which the film is based. He's built a strangelooking thing that propels him through space into the future and on New Year's Eve of 1899 that's just what he does. He watches the store mannequin across the street change styles until suddenly in 1917 his house is bathed in darkness from being boarded up. Going outside he meets Filby's son whom he also meets as an old man in 1966 during an atomic war. Finally he lands way way into the future and finds a land filled with blond youths who seem to have no feelings. He falls for one of them Weena who says she is an Eloi and he eventually learns about the Morlocks who live below and control the Eloi.Shot in color and directed by George Pal The Time Machine has some fantastic effects and a good story. Whether it's the story Wells wrote I can't say. According to one comment Wells' point was entirely missed. So the film has to be judged on its own merits. All the doom and gloom seen in the future is apparently not new  that's a comfort since we're all still here.The story manages to have the trappings of sci fi as well as being moving in sections particularly in the friendship of Filby and George. The best part and the best performance belong to Young and I believe this is his favorite film. He plays Filby his son and his young son as an old man very well the old man having the showiest material. Taylor makes a good leading man. Mimieux doesn't have much to do except look pretty and be passive.Again going back to one of the comments the ending is pure Hollywood. The Time Machine film however is very entertaining. Best not to compare it to the book I guess.".

Whether it's the story Wells wrote I can't say. According to one comment Wells' point was entirely missed. So the film has to be judged on its own merits. All the doom and gloom seen in the future is apparently not new  that's a comfort since we're all still here.The story manages to have the trappings of sci fi as well as being moving in sections particularly in the friendship of Filby and George. The best part and the best performance belong to Young and I believe this is his favorite film. He plays Filby his son and his young son as an old man very well the old man having the showiest material. Taylor makes a good leading man. Mimieux doesn't have much to do except look pretty and be passive.Again going back to one of the comments the ending is pure Hollywood. The Time Machine film however is very entertaining. Best not to compare it to the book I guess.";

	schema:headline " the DVD brings this movie back in all of its original grandeur!";
	schema:reviewBody "Firstly let me say that The Time Machine has been and is one of my favorite movies. I was too young to see it in its original theatrical release and first became exposed to it when it finally made it to broadcast TV in the the later '60 s. Even on the small screen and with commercials it still had the ability to fascinate a 10 year old who saw it for the first time. Then it seemed to disappear until the late 1980's when I saw it again on a defective laser disc and finally in the 1990's on cable.I purchased the recently released DVD just this week. From the first shot of the MGM logo in brilliant color and the glorious opening music of Russell Garcia swelling from the speakers of my home theater system I experienced the thrill that people must have felt when the movie was first shown in theaters. The colors are vibrant and the movie has been restored to crystal clarity. Finally you can see every detail of George's Victorian living room. At last we can read Mfg. by H.G. Wells on the time machine's console. Unlike the truncated picture version seen on TV this widescreen DVD shows parts of the movie that haven't been seen in years example when Philby points to the sky and says atomic satellite zeroing in you can finally SEE what he is pointing to.However for me the biggest treat on the DVD is a wonderful documentary about the Time Machine narrated by Rod Taylor. I think the documentary was made in the early 1990's for Turner Classic Movies. You can see that Taylor has very fond memories of making the film stating that at the end of production that everyone connected with the film had the feeling that they had just made a classic movie. He also has great personal praise for George Pal at one point doing a remarkable imitation of Pal's Hungarian accent! Thoroughly fascinating is the story of how the design of Time Machine itself was conceived and it's subsequent history after the movie. Wah Chang and Gene Warren give a great exposition of how the special effects were done. Another little gem in the documentary is Rod Taylor reading a selection from H.G. Wells'original story. But the piece de la resistance comes towards the end. Whit Bissel shows up reprising his role in the movie andespeciallythere is a touching and wonderfully done reunion between Alan Young as Philby and Taylor set 25 years after the events of the movie. The script for this scene was written by none other than David Duncan himself who wrote the script for the movie. This scene brought a tear to the eye and a lump in the throat of this hardened movie goer I can tell you! I would recommend this DVD to all fans of great science fiction movies and as an example of a time when these types of movies still made some demand on the intellect of the viewerunlike the violent and CGI effectsladen popcorn for the mind that current scifi movies are including the recent remake of this movie. The original Time Machine compared to today's scifi movies proves that the most elaborate computergenerated effects gory violence earsplitting explosions and MTVstyle editingcannot replace a good and challenging story.".

	schema:headline " The blueprint for time traveling";
	schema:reviewBody "Films and books dealing with man's desire to travel through time seem to have been around forever. Ever since I was very young I have always had a certain kind of affection for films that dealt with man wanting to revisit the historic past or zoom off into the unknown and unseen future. My fondness for time travel goes back a long way and can be directly attributed to the first time I ran across this wonderful film by George Pal based on the H.G. Wells novel.Rod Taylor plays George H.G.Wells an inventor who has invented a machine capable of traveling through what he calls the fourth dimension better known as time. He explains this to his friends over dinner who understandably scoffs at the possibilities. If time travel were possible' one of them asks what would one do with the machine? It's not like there are any commercial uses for it.' I guess some things aren't that much different now than they were over a hundred years ago after all. George's best friend David Filby Alan Young warns him that if indeed George has invented such a machine he should destroy it before the machine destroys him'. I don't know what Filby meant by that and apparently George didn't either or just didn't care because he decides to take a little trip anyway just as we knew he would.And what kind of a journey is time travel as imagined by George Pal in 1960. With a budget of about 850000 dollars it's a pretty good one. As George travels he continually narrates his journey so that we know what his thoughts are as he travels from one moment to the next. With the simple use of timelapse photography we see the world changing around George as the years go by first slowly than at a rapid relentless pace. We see the sun and moon rise and set at a breakneck speed. Through the window of his lab George can see a department store mannequin whose outfit changes from season to season and from year to year. He watches with a bemused look as the fashions change and women's dresses get shorter and shorter. In one amusing moment while considering the situation George pushes further into the future just to see how far women would go with these newfangled styles. We see dust and cobwebs amass around the empty lab George has left behind. Buildings outside George's now deserted home rise and fall with uncanny precision. It's a memorable trip and one done without one bit of excessively done fancy showboating special effects. It certainly lends credence to the fact that it's still the story that counts.Since the film was made in 1960 some of what occurs does seem dated. In 1966 a war involving nuclear satellite breaks out that is the beginning of man's downfall. The effects used to show the resulting volcanic explosions and lava that flows through the streets certainly show their age but one can expect such things when watching a film made more than forty years ago and you just have to overlook them.Much more successful is the sequence where George ends up in the distant future discovering exactly what happened when the wars and man's self destruction finally did subside. It is here that we meet Weena Yvette Mimeaux of the Iloi and the Morlocks. The Iloi are a peace loving tribe who bask in the sun all day and the Morlocks being a vicious tribe of underground inhabitants whom prey on the Iloi for reasons that quickly become evident. The very young and very beautiful Mimeaux is an excellent choice for Weena as she has an endearing charm about her in the way she relates to George. It also helps that the role doesn't require a great deal of emotional depth since this was a quality that Mimeaux seemed to lack in many of her later films. Taylor was a great pick for George also. In one of his best roles he portrays George as a man passionate about his ideas and steadfast in his desire to see them through. Yet when needed Taylor depicts a George that is every bit a man who is passionate not only about his friends but about the human race and the destiny that awaits us.Just as George Pal has shown us that it's the characters and the story that count Nicholas Meyers achieved the same type of success years later with the film Time After Time. See Flack's review. That is what makes great time travel films and no amount of grandiose CGI can compensate for that. And if you make a film about time travel that I can still write about and praise fortyfour years later I have no choice but to give you my grade which for The Time Machine is an A.".

	schema:reviewBody "I guess I'm goin against the flow here.  Everyone thinks to seem this is a cute wonderful little tale.  Although I think the film is decent for 1960you wanna see real special effects and psychological mind numbingness check out Psycho it lacks a whole hell of alot.  I don't read much and I'm adamant about not comparing the film to the book but assessing the film as it's own entity.  Unfortunately when a movie is filled with as many plot holes inconsistencies and downright silly plot points as this one you may find it necessary to refer to the book merely to try and aid your proccess in understanding the lost potential in this film.  The essence of what Wells is saying in the book is sorely missed in the film as the filmmakers seemed to have solely based the film about the nuclear threat of the late fifties. The Time Machine is nothing about war.  It's about people's views toward each other and how class separation over thousands of generations undermined the great human race into a species of oblivious mundane mediocre couldn't care lesses.  Wells does a beautiful job of describing the frailties of both the Eloi and the Morlocks and does a wonderful job of making a point that they are essentially the same neither is the bad guy to the other.  Both live out of ignorance.  Both are innocent as children and Wells draws strong parallels to these descendants of the decadent aristocracy and the supressed and opressed working class people forced further and further beneath the surface.  he also does not hint at a hopeful recovery.  As the Time Traveller leaves the future he realizes quite plainly that these are no longer homo sapiens.  Possibly some inferior degradation but their damage has gone far beyond psychological damage that can be reveresed with a mere three books.  The only  hope for the Eloi and Morlocks would lie in a change found thousands of years earlier. Therefore it was quite foolish to try and add a happy open ending where the vigil Time Traveller is going back to save humanities future.  You obviously cannot make the book verbatim into the movie but you can try and do justice to Wells brilliant observations of the human spirit and behaviour for surely there is a brilliant movie with these themes prevailing just waiting to be made.".

Although I think the film is decent for 1960you wanna see real special effects and psychological mind numbingness check out Psycho it lacks a whole hell of alot.  I don't read much and I'm adamant about not comparing the film to the book but assessing the film as it's own entity.  Unfortunately when a movie is filled with as many plot holes inconsistencies and downright silly plot points as this one you may find it necessary to refer to the book merely to try and aid your proccess in understanding the lost potential in this film.

Undaunted by the disbelief of his friends he climbs into the machine and finds himself soaring forward through time witnessing both World Wars and then the nuclear wars of the future or in this case 1966. The lava engulfing vehicles in the high street might resemble jam engulfing Matchbox toys today but we get the idea. Taylor finally finds himself hundreds of thousands of years in the future where mankind has split into two separate races  the gentle Eloi and the cannibalistic Morlocks.Befriending Weena one of the Eloi Taylor learns through talking discs an uncanny prediction of CD technology? the history of the world. He is disconcerted when his time machine disappears inside a giant Sphinxlike building and comes to realise that the Morlocks which live underground have stolen it. Soon Weena too disappears into the Morlocks' caverns and Taylor climbs down an air vent to battle with the creatures...This is by all respects a superb adaptation of the H. G. Wells story about a man who travels forward into the future. Made in 1960 this film has hardly dated and the special effects are still effective even today when I was younger I was scared out of my wits by the decaying of the Morlock in the final reel. Okay so they might not be realistic but they're still brilliantly conveyed. Also the crisp colour photography really makes this one stand out from the crowd as well as a high action content which is always a crowdpleaser.Rod Taylor may not be everyone's choice to play a Wellsian hero but he is intensely likable and makes a good action figure similar to the character he played in Hitchcock's THE BIRDS. He remains cool throughout the film his hair never gets messed up and he's just the kind of macho figure that a film like this needs. The film benefits from some fine sets especially the sitting room where Taylor relates his story  dozens of clocks line the walls authentic costumes good special effects and having such a charismatic actor as the lead. Taylor is supported well by Yvette Mimieux as a shy childlike love interest and Alan Young as a kindhearted fellow scientist who overdoes the stereotypical Scottish thing a bit too much.The best part of the film is the spectacular ending where Taylor fights the dreaded Morlocks in the burning caverns! The Morlocks are essentially rubbersuited monsters with lumpy faces and piglike eyes this made them very hideous and extremely frightening to me when I was young. It's simple things which are most effective. THE TIME MACHINE is a very lighthearted romp and lots of fun this is a delight to watch if you want cheering up a film to make you happy excited awed and fearful. One of the best Wells adaptations around and also one of my favourite films.".

	schema:reviewBody "Like all William Castle films the story of STRAITJACKET is slight full of holes and often silly to the point of absurdity. Long ago Joan Crawford came home to find her husband in bed with a floozie and snatched up an ax. Adjudged insane she is locked up in an asylum for twenty years but now she's homeand pretty soon some really weird things begin to happen around the old family farm. Could it be oh I don't know... JOAN? Throughout his career producerdirector William Castle liked to build his movies around gimmicks TINGLER had Percepto 13 GHOSTS had IllusionO and HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL had Emergo. But STRAITJACKET had something better Joan Crawford herself who plays in a style that can only be described as EmoteORama. Say what you like about Crawford she never gave any performance less than one hundred percent and in STRAITJACKET she gives one hundred and fifty. In the opening scenes 60something Joan has the unmitigated gall to play Lucy in her 20s! Later as Lucy in her 40s Joan plays the role like a nice little old lady who occasionally drops acid when she's not busy with her nervous breakdown she sucks down bourbon attempts to seduce her daughter's boyfriend even to the point of putting her fingers in his mouth knits like a fiend lights a cigarette by striking a match on a record album raises hell at a dinner party... and all of it about as subtle as a bulldozer.But they didn't call her a star for nothing not only does Crawford manage to carry it off with complete conviction she actually manages to endow the character with considerable pathos along the way. And I have absolutely no doubt that THIS was the film Faye Dunaway studied the most when preparing to play Crawford in the infamous MOMMIE DEAREST watch both backtoback and you'll know exactly what I mean.The rest of the cast is pretty interesting as well featuring Diane Baker as daughter Carol Leif Erickson as Crawford's brother George Kennedy as an unsavory farmhand and a very young Lee Majors as the illfated husbandnot to mention Mitchell Cox a Pepsi V.P. Joan was favoring at the time. There are cheap special effects amazing how she can neatly lop off a head or two with a single blow PepsiCola product placements and even some dialogue that would do Ed Woods proud. It's all campy and bizarre and hilariously weird and ramped up to the nth degree by Crawford's fullforce performance.With a somewhat better script and production values STRAITJACKET could easily have matched Bette Davis' more sophisticated HUSH HUSH SWEET CHARLOTTE as it stands however it is a cult movie in all caps. The DVD release is very nicely done with the film itself in excellent condition. A collection of Crawford's costume tests gives a surprising insight to actress' personality and a particularly nice little makingof documentary includes comments from Diane Baker. Note don't watch the documentary called BattleAx until after you've seen the film it's a spoiler. Strongly recommended to Castle Cult and Crawford fans! Gary F. Taylor aka GFT Amazon Reviewer".

Well supported by the underrated Diane Baker Leif Erikson Rochelle Hudson and George Kennedy she gives meaning and depth to what otherwise would have been just another horror film. Whether playing scenes with daughter Baker's boyfriend John Anthony Hayes or his snobbish parents Howard St John and Edith Atwater Crawford is on the money using her years of experience to transcend her material. Thanks to her StraitJacket is a worthy thriller from a Legendary Star and a fondly remembered director. See Castle's other collaboration with Joan I Saw What You Did 1965. It's a winner too!".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the most enjoyable horror films ever.  The closing credits gag reveals the spirit of the picture  it is not to be taken seriously.  By the way don't spoil a great laugh by reading what that gag is in the crazy credits section.  This is pure camp fun played brilliantly by Joan Crawford in an Oscar worthy performance.  The opening narration is hilarious  and Joan's getup black fright wig clinging floral dress and clanging bangles is outrageous.  You'll probably guess the surprise ending  but that's not what this film is about.  Besides the fun element there is also a subversive political statement  Castle sets his axemurder horror on a sweet little farm that looks like a set from a family sitcom.  And the family that live in it are too good to be true as well.  But all this is a facade as insanity lust and murder lie just below the surface.Also of note in the cast are George Kennedy  excellent as the twisted handyman and Diane Baker as the perfect daughter.  And apparently that's Lee Majors being hacked up at the start of the film.  Castle does a brilliant directing job but it's Joan's film all the way  what she can do with knitting and matches is truly amazing!  And the scene where she attempts to seduce her daughter's boyfriend is nothing short of magic.  I can't believe that an actress who could play this scene with such good humour could have taken herself as seriously as Mommie Dearest suggests. Do not miss this overlooked classic.".

Watch for the famous cardboard axe in shadow and a hilarious cat fight with her daughter who literally throws herself on the bed and squeals. But don't poke fun it might be verging on farce but this is a tight pacey film with some good direction and camerawork. The overhead shot of Joan losing it in the tiny closet with the NASTY striped wallpaper is worth the price of admission alone. Recommended.".

Fast forward 20 years and Joan's character is considered reformed and sent to stay with her daughter her brother and his wife. The rest of the movie revolves around deaths that occur at the house and if Joan's character is to blame or someone else.This is a pretty cool flick all around as it has an ax wielding psycho Joan Crawford Leif Invasion from Mars Erickson and George Breath Assure Kennedy giving us a very heady performance. It also has some sequences for its time that would have probably made the teeny boppers of the era squirm up to their man in the theater.All in all I think this is one of those films that if your a horrorthriller fan you owe it to yourself to at least check out once as it does what is trying to do effectively even though you can see the end coming before you get there. With the characters all in place and an interesting story I give Joan's Ax Wielding flick 710 good.StraitJacket is out now on TriStar DV. Definitely give it a go!!!Until next time folks here is a tip If your married and you want to cheat on your wife make sure you leave the ax locked up real tight in the shed cause if you don't you could lose more than your money if she catches you!!!I'm out!!".

	schema:reviewBody "I am redoing this reviewI did the original one five years ago and I think I can top myself. I rated this movie as excellent and I am going to explain why I rated it so darned highly.Isn't Joan Crawford the coolest? Some people jokingly call this movie Blanche's Revenge as Joan eschewed the wheelchair of Baby Jane and replaced it with an axe. It would have been really nifty if she'd been an axe murderer and in a wheelchair. That would have kicked tail. This movie was made in 1964 and William Castle was attempting to better his reputationhe was known for scaring people but I think he really wanted an Amovie to his credit. After seeing Baby Jane he decided that using a bonafide star might help him in his plan and he pitched Robert Bloch's StraitJacket story to Joan Crawford. Lucky for him she agreed to do it and he earned a little critical recognition for a change.The plot is simple enoughJoan Crawford plays Lucy Harbin a young woman of 29 who witnesses her husband cheating on her with a former girlfriend. The shock of being thrown over drives her to madness and she dispatches both her husband and the hussy while they sleep. The couple's threeyearold daughter Carol watches horrified and Castle cuts get it? to another shot of the daughter now grown. She's telling her fiance about her past because as she abruptly puts it My mother's coming home from an asylum. Today. That line kills meshe gave him so much time to prepare huh? Once Lucy returns Carol begins going to great lengths to turn the presentday Lucy into the Lucy of twenty years earlier. Obviously that isn't such a hot idea because Lucy was a murderess. Even more distressing Lucy gives several indications that she isn't completely rehabilitatedwhen the asylum doctor shows up to say hello she wigs out completely and runs screaming from the room. Eventually anyone and everyone who discovers Lucy's imbalance gets offed. Is Lucy regressing or has she been usurped? That is the basis of the movie's surprise ending which I of course didn't figure out. My mother did but she always does. Okay so why is this movie so entertaining? If you guessed Joan Crawford you guessed right. William Castle's idea works wonderfully. He chose someone who would give her all to make sure a movie worked and that's what happens. At the time Joan was sixty years old give or take a few and she throws herself into the role of a 29yearold with gusto. She doesn't succeed but she tries. Her character starts out as a brunette brazen floozytype and ends up a grayhaired timid middleaged woman. It doesn't seem like such a big difference on paper but when you see the difference between Joan's first and second entrances it's quite effective. Also who among us knew besides Christina Crawford apparently that Joan could swing an axe like that? Move over Lizzie Borden Joan's on the warpath! And the seduction scene with daughter Carol's fiance? I don't think a movie has ever made me squirm so much. It's horrible but you can't look awayLucy goes through about fifteen emotions in less than fifteen minutes. Just thinking about it makes me feel icky and nothing really happens. That's the weird partnobody does much of anything but it's so damn disgusting. The DVD features a little makingof featurette and one of the film historians says in a awed tone She actually puts her finger in his mouth. I guess it bothered him too! If I had to choose the one part of this movie that raises it over other movies of its ilk it would be the first murder scene. The moment where Lucy poisoned with anger and wielding an axe wreaks havoc on her sleeping husband. I just feel that a jealousycrazed woman brutally murdering her husband would have the same look on her face as Joan does in the scene. It's absolute blind rage and she has no control over it. To be blunt she looks like an insane killer and she is more than a little creepy doing it. I just thought of another great partat the end of the picture the Columbia Pictures lady has been beheaded. Cute little touch huh?".

The rest you can guess but maybe you'll guess wrong. I said maybe.This is an interesting film. It is deceivingly naive but those able to go beyond the story will make their own discoveries. For one thing StraitJacket was filmed in 1963 when society was more conservative  social rules and divisions were much more rigid then. There were mainly two choices especially in small towns and rural areas  either adapt to society and its straightjacket or else be an outcast. Why am writing this? Because this is one of my readings of the film.Anyway StraitJacket is a good thriller not so much for the scares but rather for the atmosphere. Well it hasn't the sophistication of some film noirs of the 40s and 50s but its charm resides in its simplicity not deprived of sense of humor. Joan Crawfords acting is of course superb and the supporting cast does also a good job. The story is interesting and will keep your attention till the end.I've seen 2 other Castle films The Tingler and House on Haunted Hill  both of them funny and entertaining but I think that StraitJacket is the best one  it is not so amateurish and goes deeper than the other ones but still preserves the light touch characteristic of William Castle. There are surprises in store. Go for it!".

	schema:headline " Excellent little shocker from William Castle!";
	schema:reviewBody "William Castle is best known for fun gimmicky horror flicks the likes of The House on Haunted Hill and The Tingler but his resume features some more complex films that can comfortably sit alongside the best Bmovies of the sixties and StraightJacket is one such film. Obviously a film of this nature relies heavily on its lead star so it's a good job that this one benefits from a great leading performance courtesy of the fabulous Joan Crawford. Crawford isn't as good here as she was two years earlier in Whatever Happened to Baby Jane but she approaches her role with seriousness and it gives the film a sense of credibility not often associated with this type of film. The plot takes obvious influence from Psycho and focuses on Lucy Harbin. She was sent to an asylum after she discovered her husband in bed with another woman and proceeded to axe them both to death. She is released twenty years later still on the brink of sanity and is reunited with her daughter Carol who was present at the murder and discovers that she is engaged to be married.The tagline which states that the film 'vividly depicts axe murders' isn't exactly true and the film is not very shocking in today's day and age. However this would obviously have been different back in 1964 and despite no real money shots Castle gives his film a great macabre atmosphere and this adequately provides the horror on its own. Crawford gets a great support cast to work with and again the film transcends its Bmovie heritage as they're all extremely good. Diane Baker Leif Erickson and my personal favourite George Kennedy all manage to give standout performances behind the leading lady. The film opens up with a great little sequence which shows why the lead character was sent to the asylum and although the plotting takes a downturn after that Castle manages to keep things interesting all the way down to the explosive ending. The final plot twist isn't exactly impossible to figure out but I have to say that it caught me by surprise and while not everything completely makes sense by the end Castle does a good job of implementing the twist. Overall Homicidal and Mr Sardonicus still top my list of favourite William Castle films but StraightJacket isn't far behind and comes highly recommended!".

	onyx:emotionText "William Castle is best known for fun gimmicky horror flicks the likes of The House on Haunted Hill and The Tingler but his resume features some more complex films that can comfortably sit alongside the best Bmovies of the sixties and StraightJacket is one such film. Obviously a film of this nature relies heavily on its lead star so it's a good job that this one benefits from a great leading performance courtesy of the fabulous Joan Crawford.

	schema:reviewBody "Wow where to begin with 'StraitJacket'?  First of all people who aren't keen on either Crawford or 60's horror movies shouldn't and probably wouldn't bother with this in the first place.  That being said its great fun.  Joan Crawford is the film's main  perhaps only  asset.  Crawford is considered by many now as a camp icon.  This does her a great disservice because it undervalues her talents as an actress.  Quite simply she was the greatest female movie star.  One of the best  and paradoxically saddest  things about Crawford was that whatever she was in she always gave maximum efforts to her performance.  This is sad because a movie like this isn't really worthy of the depth that she adds to the character.  Adding Mildred Piercelevel emotion to 'StraitJacket' is almost tragic to watch if you think about how her career had gone.  One of the trademarks of a truly great actor is the ability to rise above the material and Crawford certainly does this here cranking up the actingometer up to 150.'StraitJacket' certainly compares well with others in its genre. Personally I found it a lot more enjoyable that 'Whatever Happened...' perhaps because Bette Davis wasn't in it.  It may not have the subtext of 'Baby Jane' or 'Lady in a Cage' but no other words to really explain it it is simply more fun to watch.".

Castle's later films and antics proved him to be more of an entertainer than auteur.  Pranks and gadgets such as a ghost' on string and electrified seats are now legendary.  With StraitJacket Castle was obviously influenced and trying to cashin on the success of Psycho.  Both films are based on stories by author Robert Bloch and have similar themes. However StraitJacket is closer in spirit to Psycho 2 than the original. Perhaps Psycho 2 a rarity in that is a decent horror sequel was in turn influenced by StraitJacket.  Avoid Psycho 3.Lucy Harbin arrives home early one night and catches her husband with another woman.  In a fit of rage she chops them up with an axe.  The ordeal unhinges her and she is committed to an asylum.  Lucy's daughter Carol witnesses the killings.  Twenty years later Lucy is released cf. Psycho 2 and goes to stay with her brother's family which includes Carol on a farm. Events do not go well Lucy starts to relapse and there is a handy axe on the farm.Joan Crawford whose real name was Lucille plays Lucy.  Like her costar Bette Davis in Whatever Happened To Baby Jane? she featured in a range of horror films in the latter years of her career.  This was far removed from the Thirties and Forties when Crawford was a major star.  The same syndrome is also witnessed with George Kennedy appearing here before his career took off'.  In the Eighties he appears in a range of horror movies the best being Just Before Dawn.Although Alfred Hitchcock described Psycho as a comedy' it is played relatively straight and is an effective slice of horror.  StraitJacket is too tongue in cheek to be taken seriously and hence fails as a horror.  For example when Lucy first arrives at the farm the warm' greeting by her relations is marred by unfortunate references to murder.  These include verbal gaffs the tour of the livestock and the ceramic bust.  These are crammed together and too grating.spoilersAnother major fault of the film is that its raison d'etre is a bit obvious from the outset.  Therefore the film lacks mystery and meanders.  On the plus side the decapitations are fun' the film being a prototype slasher of sorts.  Tobe Hooper The Texas Chain Saw Massacre must have seen the scene where the farmhand investigates the freezer.  Crawford's portrayal of a mentally unsound person is competent but the youthful' attire is atrocious.more spoilersThe film addresses to some extent the prejudice discomfort and hostility met by people with mental illness and also ex convicts trying to reestablish themselves into society cf. Psycho 2.  At the finale only Lucy is able to forgive and accept responsibility.  Incidentally the best film I have seen about mental illness is Clean Shaven but that is principally a drama and hence an entirely different game.".

The material to be fair gives her precious little to work with. Twenty years ago we are told Lucy Harper was declared legally insane. She walked in on her studly younger hubby a prefame Lee Majors sleeping with the local floozy and took an axe to both of them.This initial double murder is shown in flashback and the scariest thing about it is Crawford's entrance by narration we are told that Lucy Harper was very much a woman and very much aware of it! Lucy steps off a train platform strikes a seductive pose throws her cigarette over her shoulder and walks to her shabby little house as screeching jazz blares in the background. This would've been a hysterically camp entrance for ANYONE but the fact that it's a sixtyish Joan Crawford made up to look thirtysomething sleazy floral dress jangling charm bracelets and a ridiculous black wig transcends camp and sends it into orbit.Flash forward to the present Lucy is being released from the mental hospital and coming to live with her daughter Carol Diane Baker and her brother and sisterinlaw on their farm. As soon as Lucy arrives murders begin occurring again. Who could be behind them? Well since this is a Joan Crawford film you can bet that she ain't the villain. You can also bet that a case of PEPSI makes a prominent cameo appearance at the behest of the former Mrs. Alfred Steele international spokeswoman for the soda pop. Instead it is revealed at the crazed finale that Carol is the new murderessshe witnessed the original double homicide and that trauma plus her growing resentment of her mother caused her to snap.In an obvious nod to Psycho Carolasamurderess is shown committing her final crime dressed AS her mothercomplete with a rubber mask fashioned after Crawford's face! In a sublimely surreal moment mother and daughter tussle wearing the same dress same bad wig...and then Lucy rips the mask off of Carol's face. The only scarier scene possible was when Crawfordinblackface ripped off her wig in Torch Song revealing her flaming orange hair.There are more howlingly funny scenes Lucy regressing to her sex kitten past by cranking up bad jazz records swigging her liquor and then lighting a match on the spinning record! Brilliant! Or the loony confrontation between Lucy and the rich bitch mother of Carol's fiance as Lucy freaks outMRS FIELDS It wasn't JUST a sanitorium was it? WAS IT!!!!!LUCY NO! It was an ASYLUM!!!! And it was HELL! Twenty years of PURE HELL!The completely insane coda has Lucy explaining how Carol carried out her diabolical scheme She must have hidden it in her purse she deadpanswatch the film and understand why that line gives this writer fits of laughter and then calmly preparing to visit Carol in the loony bin. Never mind that the woman axed two people in a jealous rage. Never mind that she's been portrayed as teetering on the brink of insanity for the last 80 minutes. Suddenly Crawford is playing her as she would one of her noble composed 1930's MGM heroines. Absolutely twisted.The axe murders aren't graphic in the least there's more gore in the biggerbudgeted higherbrow Davis vehicle Hush...Hush Sweet Charlotte and in the end this is less a horror movie than it is another in a long line of mother vs. daughter Joan Crawford melodramas. However this is a far way down from Mildred Pierce. For sheer enjoyment camp appeal and demented guilty pleasure StraitJacket is ideal. And remember Don't give away the surprise shock ending!".

But she tackles the role with such seriousness and commitment that she singlehandedly ends up selling the film to you and making you genuinely care about her character and what happens to her. Joan Crawford may have been hell to live and work with in her personal life but it takes an actress with a unique skill to make a film like this not only competent but almost fascinating.As for the movie itself it's laughably predictable. I called the surprise ending about fifteen minutes into the film and then talked myself out of it because I thought it would be too obvious. Well I should have stuck to my guns but it didn't much matter  by the end I was no longer watching the film for the ending  I was watching it for Joan which is the only reason albeit a damn good one for watching this film at all.Grade B".

By the 1960s she was reduced to playing caricatures of herself or ghouls as in this William Castle thriller.Robert Psycho Bloch penned this slasher film about a jealous woman who spends 20 years in an asylum after she took an axe and gave her husband 40 whacks...and gave his girlfriend 41. She's finally released to the custody of her brother and his wife and her longlost daughter who witnessed the murders as a child.It's not hard to guess how it's going to end but it's kind of fun watching it all spin out with a few beheadings along the way to keep one's interest. The early scenes where the daughter shows Joan around the farm are priceless as she keeps tripping up when talking about slaughtering animals as are the various foreshadowing scenes involving knives. George Kennedy plays a gruff and creepy farm hand beheading a chicken. Keep your eyes open for Lee Majors in his first screen role as the 1 axe victim. And watch for the Pepsi product placement thanks to Joan's contract she was on the Pepsi board.Joan gets to run the gamut here from mad slasher to timid wallflower to overthetop vamp. It's all hokey and hackneyed but enjoyable for fans of Joan Crawford or William Castle.".

Time moves up to the present and Crawford who now seems cured is allowed to come home to live with her brother and his wife and the daughter she had left in their care. William Castle directs this campy classic with a pretty straitforward approach as Lucy comes home and strange things start to happen to her and around her and of course in a film like this to other people and their health and welfare. Has she regressed? Well I cannot answer that question here and now but just remember one thing  this film was directed by William Castle. The acting in this film is good by all accounts Diane Baker does a credible job as the daughter trying to cope with having her mother back. George Kennedy axes the wrong questions as he plays a farmhand with callous seediness. But it is Crawford that will have your attention throughout. Not necessarily because she is real good but because she doesn't seem to mind at all playing a fool to her image. When she comes out in a flowered dress with bangles on her arm as a bracelet and an obvious wig in the prologue sequence  she looks so ridiculous that you know this has to be high camp. She supposedly is playing a young swinging virile woman but looks like she's been roaming a nursing home for a few years. When she gets back to the present she plays herself for a bit but then things start to turn her back into sexy campy Joan. Check out the scene where she hits on her daughter's boyfriend with the record player playing. It sent chills down my spine and raised what hairs I have on my head. It has to be one of the campiest portrayals  whether intended or not  I have ever seen. Give this one a look just for Joan's performance! As for the axe murders  they are done fairly suspensefully and Castle has always been more than competent behind the lens with this type of material.".

A murder movie was never this much plain dumb entertaining fun. Joan Crawford's over the top performance as a wronged woman who decides to make her younger husband and his mistress into chop suey with an axe and is put away for 20 years and to be blamed for recurring murders when she is released is a case of it doesn't get any better than this. You almost want to laugh when two victims get their head seperated from their bodies because of the hokey effects. Basically it looks like display heads falling on the floor. But that's a part of the charm of this movie. Crawford's young husband is played by a young Lee Majors. While the effects dialogue and acting are in fact a little hammy and over the top at times the story is actually quite decent. This whole movie is classic Castle. While it isn't Oscar winning it is just plain fun. So make some popcorn find a comfortable chair relax and enjoy. You will have fun watching this horror film".

	schema:reviewBody "Die Zwillinge vom Immenhof is a West German German language movie from 1973 so this one will have its 45th anniversary next year. It runs for 90 minutes and the director is once again Wolfgang Schleif who is also one of the two writers. The title here tells you already that this is another entry to the Immenhof films actually film number four out of five and the title tells you as well that a twin duo arrives at the farm this time but given the fact that they are part of the title I found them surprisingly insignificant in terms of the overall story. Then again the entire movie felt a bit insignificant. Once again there is some financial drama some stuff about owning the farm some relationship drama and some other stuff and honestly it is all really generic and predictable of course with the happy ending. I am not necessarily against heile Welt films but occasionally it is just too much especially if the actually dramatic parts are executed in a manner as shoddy as they are here. The acting wasn't too memorable either gently speaking and I just don't think Horst Janson is not that good really. Brhl also needs much better material than here to shine. I think it would have been the appropriate reaction after this one to end the series but they made one more. Oh well I cannot say I am surprised that key players from the previous films when it did not suck that much like Angelika Meissner had already left the franchise a long time ago. After all it went on for almost two decades now. I don't recommend Twins from Immen Farm it is definitely nowhere near the best the franchise has to offer.".
