Professional jealousy and abuse of power threaten Dr. Roy even as the Secretary of Health reprimands him for breaking the news to the press. He is asked to report to the Director of Health. Professional colleagues Dr. Arijit Sen and Dr. Ramananda invite him to a lecture but it is merely a pretence to humiliate him. Dr. Roy suffers a mild heart attack but he refuses to go to the hospital. His wife and few others like Dr. Kundu stand by Dr. Roy but the harassment continues a letter from an American foundation is suppressed and Dr. Roy transferred to a remote village. The last straw is two American doctors receiving credit for discovering the same vaccine. Dr. Roy is shattered.";

The direction and screenplay are realistic and natural. The brilliant performances by Shabana Azmi and Pankaj Kapur in lead roles are so full of life and emotion. The background music with the full flair of Bengal is touching and throbbing in many frames of the film.The movie was inspired a real life personality Subhash Mukhopadhyay who was the first scientist in the world to create IVF baby but was denied that honor and eventually committed suicide.The film brought alive the overall cynicism and social mores around 70s and 80s. There is lot of public anger over state apathy and corruption in today's India too. The non recognition of true talent by the state and the society humiliation instead of recognition for hard work  this still exists in some quarters. But I think things have improved and become better to a far greater extent compared to the times that this film portrays. After watching the film I was overcome also with a sense of relief along with depression and despondency perhaps out of this reason.".

Yet I never felt entirely sorry for her because she seemed well equipped to weather the putdowns that come from being an ugly girl. I ended up liking Natalie because Duke makes her likable  yeah she's got a heart of gold but she's got spirit too.  There are all kinds of nice moments here but I especially appreciate the scene at the Hoboken ferry landing where she goes to see if her fictional Prince Charming will actually materialize.  She won a Golden Globe award for this performance and it stands as probably her best work as an adult.  From here she moved into what is arguably her second best adult role in the TV film My Sweet Charlie. She won an emmy for that one.  About this time she also did a wonderful job in a PBS film called Birdbath.  Again she's paired with Farentino and again she's a plain Jane from New York City but this time with an entirely different psychological makeup from Natalie and with a horrible secret. Duke sure showed a lot of potential for the big screen...too bad it never materialized.  And it's too bad this film isn't available on VHS.".

Along the literal lines the film sensitively deals with the generation gap during the era in which it was perhaps most severe.  Impressively ageism is never cause for condescension in this film.  Not so impressively a gooey Henry Mancini soundtrack and some maudlin wannaberomantic photography date it pretty badly.  As a coming of age story the film is very much a contemporary of The Sterile Cuckoo being about a relative misfit who must find what works for her as she enters adulthood.  How one feels about these eras will invariably affect how one responds to the film.It's chief assets are it's vivid New York atmosphere and it's terrific cast. Patty Duke carries this film as effortlessly as Sandy Dennis or Natalie Wood carried earlier films of a similar nature and she is surrounded by a terrific supporting cast.  Fans of The Sopranos will enjoy seeing the late Nancy Marchand who is superb as a very different type of mother than Livia Soprano.  Martin Balsam and Elsa Lanchester are also memorable in brief appearances.  James Farentino is effective as the artist Natalie falls in love with and Al Pacino is charismatic in his first screen role as a cad she meets at a dance.  The entire cast works beautifully and makes a look at this film well worth while.".

	schema:reviewBody "Frustrating comedy drama was made after the creative and critical debacle of Valley of the Dolls and seems to have been intended primarily to rescue Patty Duke's career as a potential movie star and reestablish her as the adorable and sweet screen presence that she was before Dolls. Hiding Duke's natural appeal under bad hair a putty nose and Jerry Lewis teeth clearly wasn't the path to movie stardom because she only toplined one other theatrical movie after this one the underrated You'll Like My Mother. The bigger problem with Duke's lovemeplease performance in Me Natalie is that she doesn't do the character or the movie any favors. The basic plot involves an ugly duckling girl looking for her place in the world as a young woman. The problem with Duke's performance is that it feels shallow and gimmickyshe never captures her character's genuine pain and longing at one point when a favorite uncle she hasn't seen since childhood comes to visit she flees through her bedroom window because she feels so awful about her looks. Patty Duke and the movie also largely ignore Natalie's negative qualities such as her complete lack of empathy for other people her shallowness and her judgmental nature. At one point after leaving home she finds out that her dead uncle's former fianc has died from a drug overdose and all she feels is that it's a great opportunity for her to get her first apartment. The movie seems to think this is cute and quirky but in reality it's sad and probably a little creepy. Natalie shows a similar obliviousness to anyone's feelings other than her own when she attends a former best friend's wedding sees that the bride to be is pregnant and not marrying her boyfriend and then leaves the church without ever saying anything to her friend to even let her know that she was there. This was an opportunity for Me Natalie to confront the main character's shallow belief that beautiful people always have beautiful lives and the movie completely flubs it by not giving Natalie and her former best friend a scene together. Natalie eventually engages in an affair with a neighbor that doesn't ultimately go anywhere because the main character is too immature and indecisive. I'm sure that wasn't the intention the filmmakers had in mind with the ending but that's about the only thing you can really take away from it. Some people might find this movie of interest as a period curio or because Al Pacino turns up for one scene in his big screen debut. I can't watch Me Natalie without feeling sad for the big screen career that Patty Duke should have hadshe probably squandered more talent than any other actor or actress from her generation. How many other actors went from winning an Academy Award to doing guest spots on The Love Boat and Hawaii FiveO?".

Filmed all over Greenwich Village and Brooklyn in the late '60's the film will offer New Yorkers a nostalgic lookback. There's a beautiful score by Henry Mancini for those that like his work in the mode of TWO FOR THE ROAD and a couple of vocals by Rod Mckuen.

Its a good sequel full of laughs and fun for the family to enjoy.If you can approach this movie with an open mind and remember its not an adult's film but fun for the family you will find plenty of enjoyment and laughs for everyone in the family.";

While watching this movie for one and a half hour I've never taken a look on my watch I've never felt bored at all and I found this movie very entertaining. There were also a lot of nice laughs especially the naive but sympathetic pigeon was worth the watch  and let me tell you that it is rather difficult to make me laugh. Beside the pigeon the little girl which always saw the animals making crazy things while her mother didn't recognize anything was an entertaining running gag too. Another funny thing was the scene in the animal's Alcatraz which I thought was a nice idea. The collaboration the prejudices and the growing team spirit between the secret agencies of the cats and the dogs were also some really nice elements in this movie even if they were predictable. And the movie even had something philosophical Cats and dogs put away their prejudices to save their beloved humans together and fight a common enemy. Well I know this is a predictable content too but still very touching and even teaching for young kids who are watching this movie. And the idea of adapting the world of James Bond to the world of cats and dogs isn't silly at all but very funny for the kids nicely done for the adults who understand some funny allusions and certainly better than most of the boring super agent comedy movie in the key of Austin Powers and other boring stuff.A part of that the movie is well animated and has a perfect length. People who really like cats or especially dogs might even give a few stars more for example for the funny and cute video clips in the end of the movie.Of course this movie is just a sequel it shows nothing innovating and the story is predictable and of course there are no twists in the movie but you can't expect that from any animation movie a part of the amazing WallE. Some people here say that you should put the children into the cinema to watch this movie and head yourself for the  in my opinion  heavily overrated Inception  I mean you just can't compare those movies and if you take this point as a judgement it is certain that you may be disappointed.So don't listen to some of those really ordinary and exaggerated hate comments and spend some ninety minutes with your kids or younger sister or girlfriend or catdog fetish switch your brain off and enjoy the nice jokes and this very entertaining movie.55 to 6 stars out of 10!".

That's not to say it's great it's not but there have been far inferior kiddie films I've sat through this year with my four year old not naming any names... Alvin and Shrek. There's freeflowing action that will entertain the younglings and the animals themselves are cute andor funny enough to please all audience members though the plot has more than its fair share of eyerolling moments and the CGI is poorer than it should be considering the movie's 85m budget.The gags are hit or miss however the few that stick are quite amusing. A riff on Silence of the Lambs is hilarious and provides the sole laughoutloud scene whilst the Head of M.E.O.W the feline secret service agency Tab Lazenby  cheekily voiced by Roger Moore  offers plenty of 007 parodied humour. Elsewhere the talented voice cast do their best to inject energy into the frequently lacklustre and cheesy script. Marsden is likable as lead mutt Diggs Nolte is gruff as ever as Alec Baldwin's replacement for the hardened Butch Applegate brings the sass as Catherine and Midler is clearly having a blast as the malevolent Kitty. Chris O'Donnell fares a lot worse as liveaction character Shane Diggs' loving excop partner his unabashed mugging an absolute low in his career.Decent enough viewing with the nippers on a wet weekend.2.5 out of 5 1  Rubbish 2  Ordinary 3  Good 4  Excellent 5  Classic".

I barely heard even a laugh or giggle in the audience except for the few under 10 set kids and even they looked bored afterwards. The plot involving a neglected cat aka Kitty Galore is so silly and ridiculous even by kiddie standards. The cat who was a member of some spy group of cats called MEOWSthe counterpart to the dogs spy group that protects humansshe turns rogue and decides to take it out on humans since she was neglected by her human owners after she lost her fur in an accident while being chased by a guard dog.So she collects computer parts and starts making a device to turn dogs into rabid animals which will force humans to put them in cages and then she and her cat minions will enslave mankind. It's even insulting to kids to sit through this drivel. Some of the dialog even tries to cater to older kidsadults but it fails miserably. Bette Midler tries her best to ham it up as Kitty Galore but her voiceover is nothing more than overacted camp that's painfully unfunny. I think this movie should have been a direct to DVD releaseit didn't deserve the big screen treatment. It still amazes me how much money is spent on movies such as these when other movies that are way better and have a small budget get the direct to TV or DVD treatment. Bomb 110".

	schema:reviewBody "Well the official website for Cats  Dogs The Revenge of Kitty Galore has a paw for a mouse pointer the movie uses most every lazy pun possible about pets and a reviewer has already claimed the movie marks the end of civilization as we know it. With such prospects a film about talking cats and dogs coming together to fight off Kitty Galore voiced by Bette Midler doesn't eye well for adults. And it doesn't. Any mathematicians in the theater can better spend their time tracking the noticeable upward curve of boredom and silliness the longer the movie runs the pet gags during the end credits don't count.Aren't kids movies like this supposed to be funny despite their absurdity? It took 9 years to bring this sequel of Cats  Dogs to the theaters which gave it plenty of time to spread a wide umbrella for big name voices. Nick Nolte's deep scratchy voice took to the end credits to figure out but it stands out in his role as a scrappy mentor dog Butch the muscle of a secret agency run by semiintelligent talking dogs.We learn that dogs have an underground spy organization where no human has ever entered appropriately outfitted with hitech gadgets in the Bond tradition and specially tailored for dog clichs. Cats have a similar underground facility for their secret organization named MEOWS. The first pet puns are quirky and tone setting but after the third or fourth  and when combined with lame cultural references including Hannibal Lecter and who knows what else  it becomes torture.The main character is a German shepherd police dog named Diggs James Marsden who joins a band of unlikely heroes to try to protect humans against Kitty Galore. Diggs follows the 'Dirty Harry' template of the ends justifies his means that is he causes havoc while taking down a madman and tends to set off fiery explosions in the process. So of course he's recruited by Butch Nick Nolte to join the secret dog organization. Diggs and Butch reluctantly join teams with a top kitty agent Catherine Christina Applegate from MEOWs. Along for the ride is a pea brained pigeon Seamus Katt Williams to provide comic relief.The plot is adequately thin and senseless. They battle against Kitty Galore voiced by Bette Midler a hairless Sphinx cat who plans to enslave humans and take over the world. Her plan is to use malevolent sound waves from a weapon called The Call of the Wild by the way at an ultra low frequency just for dogs to trigger all dogs to violently rebel against humans. Humans will have to lock them all in kennels. But the movie forgets to mention how Kitty Galore intends to conquer humans. Will she change the frequencies and use the weapon on us? She doesn't specify but perhaps she could change to an appropriate frequency to trigger our caveman impulses or something.Kitty Galore is funny as she reluctantly placates her not so magical magician owner. She became evil because her previous owners treated her like a freak and threw her out after she fell into a vat of hair removal cream like the Joker from Batman. The movie has a couple other funny moments with a house filled of toolazytomove high cats and a goofy Calico cat voiced by Wallace Shawn lampooning his role in The Princess Bride. Other stars take part in hopes of success including Neil Patrick Harris Roger Moore and Joe Pantoliano but it doesn't help much.Some of the most effective scenes are ones where pets give normal pet reactions. The audience actually responded to Diggs whimpering as he was locked in his cage by his former cop partner played by Chris O'Donnell in one of the few human roles. The pets only pretend to act normal around humans but on occasion a little girl stumbles on them talking. She's amazed no one believes her and the pets resort to clichs butt sniffing for dogs.That's it. Most of the other jokes are dull. The movie becomes so lazy any action is just meaningless and boring. The movie uses a mix of live action animals puppetry and computer animation to bring the pets to life. The CGI mouths attempt to make such absurdity seem real but who cares when what they say isn't funny or interesting. The 3D wasn't very noticeable at all.".

The movie is basically about a drug lord who smuggles cocaine into the United States through bags of dog food.

His performance was nothing short of amazing. Like when he played Robin in that Batman movie.When the animals talk it looks really cool.

Now no agonizing is required Anything that involves chatty critters or cars babies vegetables toys or other entities that aren't actually capable of speech just gets dumped here.There's a general sense that these things tend to be kiddie fare with low production values and even lower IQ expectations. But a review of the 74 such movies since 2000 shows that they aren't much different than SFF movies in general coming in with an average rating of 4.92 on my scale of 19 compared to a 4.93 average for the other 474 movies in my database. Some of them have been superb Bolt Toy Story 2 Up and others very good Charlotte's Web Finding Nemo The Golden Compass a couple of Ice Age movies Monsters Inc. Ratatouille Toy Story 3 and Wallace and Gromit The Curse of the WereRabbit.At the other end of the scale are the movies that give rise to the stereotype Garfield Scooby Doo Space Chimps Alvin and the Chipmunks Beverly Hills Chihuahua VeggieTales Marmaduke Rugrats Furry Vengeance and 2 wretched excrescences called YuGiOh and Tamala 2010.The original Cats  Dogs 2001 was dead average with a 5 rating. It certainly was not the kind of artistic triumph or blockbuster hit that demanded a sequel but we got one anyway this one in all together now ooooooo 3D as if that alone justifies its existence. Is it a dog or the cat's meow? Puns intended please don't hurt me.Well in the tradition of such things there are bones thrown ouch to the adults including a lot of smirky allusions to the James Bond oeuvre. 007 fans will recognize that Kitty Galore is a pun on Bond girl Pussy Galore itself a smirking pun on something that will never sneak into a PG movie. There are silhouettes and sultry female vocals under the opening credits. And Bond actor 19731985 Roger Moore does one of the voices for Tab Lazenby head of Mousers Enforcing Our World's Safety MEOWS reminding old farts like me that the immediate successor to Sean Connery was not Moore but the hapless George Lazenby about whom nothing has been heard since 1969.Nor do they stop there. I have to give Writers Ron Friedman and Steve Bencich and Director Brad Peyton credit for working really hard at throwing in a lot of code words images and background business designed to appeal to adults. Much of it was pretty clever including allusions to movies made well before the target audience for this film was even born. But the result is schizophrenic. It's like going to see the Jerry Lewis version of Hamlet and discovering Laurence Olivier and John Gielgud playing Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.In the final analysis tho do we go to see a movie just for the puns?No we don't and regrettably the ostensible surface plot of the movie tho crammed with substance snappy dialog and a certain cockeyed coherence is pretty insipid. Once again dogs and cats are portrayed as mortal enemies enslaved to their basic natures except that this time they're required to gasp work together to foil the evil machinations of criminal mastermind Kitty Galore who intends to broadcast a worldwide dogwhistle tone from a CD helpfully Sharpied with the legend The Call of the Wild that will turn her canine nemeses into snarling menaces thus bringing their doom upon them as an alarmed humanity wipes them all out. There are more twists and turns as well as I said no lack of filling but it's all pretty much of the same caliber.The voice cast features many Blist names for no discernible reason and to no audible benefit except for Bette Midler as Kitty and the visual cast is a bunch of animals trained to assume unnatural positions and have matchmove artists do strange CGI things with their jaws. This is only fitfully effective.I saw the film in 3D. The good news is that the main feature was preceded by Coyote Falls a 3minute roadrunner cartoon in a passable imitation of the grand celanimation tradition and it used 3D to marvelous advantage with Wile E.'s latest Acme acquisition a bungee cord. The bad news is that the 3D imaging in the movie itself was sloppy with numerous cases of dogs having doubled snouts or a patch of fur seeming to float above the surface of the cat it was nominally attached to. This is a movie that didn't care enuf to send the very best.I do appreciate the attempt to give the adults something to care about tho and it was accomplished without having to distract the kids from the story they came to see so the overall effect is to get a gentleman's D from me.Besides for SFF fans they're not even nerd puns.".

This movie was a bad idea before the script writer put his pen to his notepad. My recommendation is to give this movie a pass  run as far away from it as you can and don't ever look back.

	schema:reviewBody "My younger daughter and I saw this for the second time now at her request. On opening night it was a replacement for her running out of Sorcerer's Apprentice on which she ran out spoiler after seeing the villain made out of cockroaches. This for someone who likes playing with live insects gently enough to catch a bee in her fingertips. Oddly both nights had about the same theatre audiences very light. I did not see anybody run out of the theatre as some of the one star reviewers have noted.I did not see the first one unlike several of the one star reviewers who seem to love that one and hate this one for not being the original. The Bond references start from the villain's name in the title upon which Jay Leno does a routine which is likely based on personal experience. If you know which Bond flick involves a red Mercury Cougar you'll do fine... The numerous external movies references keep the adults awake if you care. The not so cute animals add reality. Spoiler The cute puppy some of the one star reviewers want is a disguise for Kitty Galore  so there!  In animal treatment obsessed San Francisco I guess they had to give some Peta bread...  Other than a flavored iMac the product placements are kept to a minimum a Moto phone too. The San Francisco Bay Area location selections are interesting and may have been a source of ire to the one star folks Spoiler The only one that came from pure cloth was Playland at the Beach which has been gone for almost four decades plus never existed in the form depicted in the movie. Spoiler The Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk currently has the same model of attraction as used in the movie next to the Rock and Roll cars except their operational one has many old photos of the Boardwalk.With the number of one and two star reviews I would expect a piece of cow manure I would never own.

	onyx:emotionText "My younger daughter and I saw this for the second time now at her request. On opening night it was a replacement for her running out of Sorcerer's Apprentice on which she ran out spoiler after seeing the villain made out of cockroaches. This for someone who likes playing with live insects gently enough to catch a bee in her fingertips. Oddly both nights had about the same theatre audiences very light. I did not see anybody run out of the theatre as some of the one star reviewers have noted.I did not see the first one unlike several of the one star reviewers who seem to love that one and hate this one for not being the original. The Bond references start from the villain's name in the title upon which Jay Leno does a routine which is likely based on personal experience. If you know which Bond flick involves a red Mercury Cougar you'll do fine... The numerous external movies references keep the adults awake if you care. The not so cute animals add reality. Spoiler The cute puppy some of the one star reviewers want is a disguise for Kitty Galore  so there!  In animal treatment obsessed San Francisco I guess they had to give some Peta bread...  Other than a flavored iMac the product placements are kept to a minimum a Moto phone too. The San Francisco Bay Area location selections are interesting and may have been a source of ire to the one star folks Spoiler The only one that came from pure cloth was Playland at the Beach which has been gone for almost four decades plus never existed in the form depicted in the movie. Spoiler The Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk currently has the same model of attraction as used in the movie next to the Rock and Roll cars except their operational one has many old photos of the Boardwalk.With the number of one and two star reviews I would expect a piece of cow manure I would never own. Instead just as noted in the SFGate review which the low reviewers will probably hate I found a decent movie the family including our rescue cat can sit down and enjoy.P.S.

I didn't like the ending and it did confuse me a bit as to what message it was trying to get across but as for the rest of the movie I thought it was genius. The thought process was incredibly accurate the physical effects everything. Being a smoker myself the whole movie was incredibly stressful and I understood exactly what the main character felt.

One critic on the DVD box says it's like Harold and Kumar but with a chick. Personally I found it only slightly similar if even that. Possibly because I wasn't craving a white castle burger the entire time FYI the nearest one is over 5 hours away from my home.For starters this is a very unique film. I can't really compare it to anything. It does center around drugs. But instead of people just hanging out and smoking pot the whole time if I remember dazed and confused among others this is about one pothead Faris who accidentally eats a batch of special cupcakes and who leaves home on a wacky adventure trying to make things right. It kind of puts a silly spin on things showing how she has a game plan but keeps having to change it because of her dumb druginfluenced moves loves her bed way too much you'll see what I mean and basically acts like a pothead might act in certain situations. It's interesting as most of the time the filming style is bright and clear rather than dark or tripped out like so many other drug movies. The happy setting just highlights how dumb she's acting because of the drugs.I found she does a convincing job of portraying the habitual stoner so if you want to see her looking pretty and not totally and incomprehensibly stoned you should look elsewhere I thought she looked good in Scary Movie 3 and My Super Ex Girlfriend so check those out. But back to the acting the cast worked well together in this one with Adam Brody from the OC as the dreadlocktoting drug dealer and John Krasinski from The Office as the infatuated friend who tries to help her get the cash she needs. Danny Masterson was also funny as the creepy roommate.It was a fun watch but overall the story is really shallow it's purely focused on Faris and her misadventures that day. That's not necessarily a bad thing given the way the film is written. I would have liked to see more of Brody and Krasinski but it was definitely a unique adventure with some definite funny moments that may take a while to get into. You'll soon find yourself hitting yourself in the head at every bonehead move that Faris makes and wondering if she'll ever sober up. I also didn't like the ending too much but then again you could argue it goes against the normal movie ending. Still I think they could have done a lot more. That's all I'll say for now enjoy the show.".

The happy setting just highlights how dumb she's acting because of the drugs.I found she does a convincing job of portraying the habitual stoner so if you want to see her looking pretty and not totally and incomprehensibly stoned you should look elsewhere I thought she looked good in Scary Movie 3 and My Super Ex Girlfriend so check those out. But back to the acting the cast worked well together in this one with Adam Brody from the OC as the dreadlocktoting drug dealer and John Krasinski from The Office as the infatuated friend who tries to help her get the cash she needs. Danny Masterson was also funny as the creepy roommate.It was a fun watch but overall the story is really shallow it's purely focused on Faris and her misadventures that day. That's not necessarily a bad thing given the way the film is written. I would have liked to see more of Brody and Krasinski but it was definitely a unique adventure with some definite funny moments that may take a while to get into. You'll soon find yourself hitting yourself in the head at every bonehead move that Faris makes and wondering if she'll ever sober up. I also didn't like the ending too much but then again you could argue it goes against the normal movie ending. Still I think they could have done a lot more. That's all I'll say for now enjoy the show.";

Instead it takes us from start to end on a Ferris wheel which suspends us in air delighting us with moments of joy but remembering the possible dangers of getting or being high.The movie shows a world filled with assholes who have chosen to change drugs usage for status and money hippies to yuppies where a possible nice person cannot adapt without getting paranoid. The paranoia lies in the main character's process of growing where she wants to be cool and responsible but some people just can't live in both worlds. The dangers of getting high or feeling good for using drugs makes the main character funny. Because in reality whoever goes through this process might feel ridiculous out of place but at same time reminds us that there is a nice view on the top of a Ferris wheel on a Monday afternoon.Not easy to dig it and could have been funnier still an excellent effort by Araki and actress Anna Faris to make us smile. Some ideas are actually cool and the Manifesto is perfectly handed out in the end.".

And therein lies much of the premise for this shtickfest. Gone are the humor intelligence wit and charm found in recent cult hits like Superbad or Harold Kumar. Instead we're left with Faris' galling portrayal of a drawling caricature replete with her perpetually unfixed gaze and the script's frequent reliance on gags that center on the character's short attention span. Add the inexplicable fits of mania and paranoia exhibited by Jane and you've got all the trappings of a very mediocre and forgettable carnival ride. Despite all of its overthetop buffoonery cheap antics and Faris' ridiculous pantomime Smiley Face is very short on laughs. A few interesting cameos do manage to conjure up a few quick chuckles but any comic momentum is quickly lost. All this and an impromptu recitation of Marx for just the price of 90 minutes that you won't get back. Worst of all the movie ends with a fingerwagging moral a denouement that assaults what little intelligence you'll have retained after a single viewing. Smiley Face is a mindless observation of vapid stupidity and a waste in more ways than one.".

To sum it up nobody said they would have paid to see this movie and nobody agreed that they would recommend this to a friend. Though it is overwhelmingly bad it was just a tester screening and they may yet make changes to this piece. Spoiler? The Upcoming portions has some stuff about the story but there is nothing really to spoil other than if you thought this was going to be a good movie.There were a few bright spots AKA Danny Masterson Adam Brody and John Cho. Danny Masterson played the supposedly geeky roommate who Anna Faris is creeped out by due to his love of SciFi. He is portrayed as being literally a spooky SkullFer ya kind of weird but funny none the less. Adam Brody plays the intelligent and economical pot dealer and in his limited role is absolutely hilarious. Anna ends up owing him money and must travel to Venice in order to pay him off or else. This is the basic premise of the movie it seems. John Cho is a sausage delivery man who has no connection to Anna other than she was so high she stowed away on his delivery truck in an effort to get to Venice. The only problem with all this is that each of these characters were in the movie for no longer than 5 or 6 minutes they had no interaction with each other and they were the funniest characters in the flick this is bad if they all have limited roles.Now onto Anna poor poor Anna. She accidentally eats a whole batch of pot cupcakes the weird part about this is that you don't actually know that these cupcakes are pot filled and goes on a 'fun' filled expedition to repay her debts. Sounds funny right? Not really she acted like she more strung out on speed or trippin on some bad shrooms or LSD...Has she ever even smoked before? It was just completely unbelievable and she was basically the entire movie considering there were no other main characters in any sense of the word. She would just go around and talk to one person then a random event will happen leading to another person and another event. As far as the story goes I don't think there was one. It just seemed like a series of random events that had a beginning a meaningless ending and nothing in between. There were many dull moments throughout the movie that made an hour and a half seem a lot longer than that.With that said there were still moments of stoner brilliance and with some quality editing and an extensive overhaul this movie may still have a chance. Remember that this movie is still in the works and they have a chance to kick it up a notch but I think it is unrealistic. Other than that I'm sad to say that Smiley Face is Dead on Arrival.".

Smiley Face is um not. It explores the much lighter taboo of recreational cannabis use by making us laugh our darn fool heads off. Let's face it after the last few years some of us have needed to do so more than ever and Araki and writer Dylan Haggerty have delivered a playful ironic comedy that honors yet transcends the traditional stoner flick.

Yes she meets a lot of people and interacts with them but still it's all about Jane who's face you find in a dictionary under the titles dumb blond and dull.

If you want to compare this to anything it seems to be an attempt at creating a modern day Reefer Madness but it's not even close to enjoyable. Everything is going wrong for the main character Mary played by Anna Ferris. The typical formula when a movie goes in this direction is that some kind of epiphany or chance event propels the character towards a resolution of there problems. I watched the entire movie only to be sadly disappointed at how it resolved these problems. To be quite honest the message delivered is smoke pot and your world will be destroyed by its affects. The movie at times severely exaggerates the effects of marijuana to include visual hallucinations that are more comparable to psychedelic drugs like LSD. Also the main character exhibits a stronger than normal addiction to pot that makes it appear to be more of a physical addiction like crack or heroin rather than psychological as is more commonly considered by the scientific community. For the uninformed movie watcher it would serve as a strong yet grossly misleading deterrent against pot use. For someone who is informed it's impossible to relate to the main character because of the exaggerated affects it portrays. I was even a little angry because I suspect that the movie's marketing is aimed specifically at stoners as evidenced by the box cover and the casting Ferris and Danny Masterson who have appeared in films and shows that are popular in the pot culture. Simply stated if you are a stoner you are going to hate this movie. If your not a stoner you will find it very unfunny.".

Happily this isn't the typical dumb serving of simulated stoned humor it elegantly captures the flavor of such classic stoner moments as stoned paranoia the giggles massive confusion stoned driving and inspired while stoned. A huge factor in the success of this comedy is Anna Faris. She's been compared to Judy Holliday but her subtly quirky performance in this movie is more reminiscent of a young Mary Tyler Moore blending emotional humor with deft physical comedy at once adorable endearing and hilarious.Araki milks her performance with simple yet inventive tech work avoiding clichd stoned camera tricks while making masterful use of his soundtrack to amp up the humor. And as usual for Araki that soundtrack is loaded with great hip offbeat tunes spanning many musical eras used effectively but subtly.While obviously not a big budget film the production values are top notch. Based on Araki's body of work he's not only one of the hippest directors working today but one of the most efficient.The rest of the cast is perfect including a small bit by Dylan Haggerty who wrote the screenplay and deserves a huge thank you for breathing new life into the genre. His script is funnier smarter and more authentically captures the essence of being stoned than other drug comedies including the very funny Pineapple Express. Finally while being stoned might enhance your enjoyment of this film it is plain outright funny and would be extremely enjoyable straight for anyone with a healthy sense of humor. In fact it's a film that any sophisticated film buff should appreciate.".

Once you get past the fact that the movie is FILLED with phenomenal performances from the likes of Laurence Fishburne Andy Garcia Tim Roth Vanessa Williams. Queen Latifah Loretta Devine Clarence Williams III and of course Miss Cicely Tyson you also discover a gem of a movie.It follows the exploits of a 30s Harlem gangster Bumpy Johnson. Fishburne reminds you of why he is such a charismatic actor. His performance here is one you can watch over and over again. Of course the movie may have been exaggerated but what movie isn't?! It is a very stylized presentation and the obvious attention to detail to create the look and the feel of the period help intensify the viewing experience.I am quite proud of the production and highly recommend it become part of your movie collection. Notwitstanding that is a worthy project there are treasures of performances here that warrant attention.".

Tim Roth gave a great performance also.The film did a great job portraying the inner turmoil of people. Also it did a great job at showing the racist attitudes of the times. Example Dutch asking his main guy who is black to wrap up his shultz sandwich scraps so that he the black guy could take them home to feed his grandkids. Classic subtle racism.The clothes and the music were also good for the period. One scene was even shot at the cotton club which no movie during this period is complete without.Great Job!

	schema:reviewBody "Snapbrim fedoras vintage autos blazing Tommy guns corrupt public officials and greedy mobsters battling it out over turf rights recur throughout director Bill Duke's violent 1930s' racketeering epic Hoodlum a pictorially authentic actioneer that evokes memories of the classic Robert Stack television series The Untouchables. Although Hoodlum boasts a topdrawer cast including Laurence Fishburne Vanessa Williams Tim Roth and Andy Garcia this lavishly mounted but uneven gangster saga suffers from its rambling length garrulous script and a shortage of shootouts. As the first major film to headline the crimes of Harlem's infamous Black Godfather Ellsworth 'Bumpy' Johnson this production offers a novel departure for audiences that are weary of superheroes female warriors and hardbitten cops who have were crowding the bigscreen when Hoodlum appeared in 1997.The Chris Brancato screenplay introduces Bumpy in 1934 as he exits Sing Sing Prison. Duke and Brancato exert great pains to differentiate Bumpy from the typical AfricanAmerican mobster. He peruses books plays chess and pens poetry. As literate as Bumpy is he can pull a trigger or wield a knife without a pang of remorse when somebody threatens a person who he loves. Like The Godfather II and Once Upon A Time in America Hoodlum charts the rise of the Godfather of Harlem in a ruthless game of survival that claims his best friend Illinois Gordon Chi McBride of I Robot and leaves Bumpy forever altered by the gory experience. Ostensibly you won't see anything in Hoodlum that you haven't seen in dozens of other crime films. Hoodlum features notorious reallife racketeers such as Dutch Schultz Tim Roth of Pulp Fiction and Lucky Luciano Andy Garcia of Godfather III as well as corrupt special prosecutor Thomas Dewey William Atherton of The Sugarland Express. When Bumpy arrives in Harlem he watches a numbers runner working for Madam Stephanie St. Clair Cicely Tyson who is the socalled 'Queen of the Numbers.' The Dutchman craves to absorb the territory that the Madam has struggled for a decade to build into the number one homegrown Harlem business. Bumpy vows to prevent any takeover by the Irish mob.Meanwhile the boorish grubby lowlife Schultz refuses to appease Lucky or Bumpy. Along the way Bumpy falls in love with righteous Francine Vanessa Williams who wants him to find respectable work. Bumpy refuses to stoop to menial employment. When Dutch cannot kill the Madam he bribes a judge to send her to the pen. Bumpy supervises the Madam's empire at her request during her absence. Bumpy's bloodthirsty methods clash with her liveandletlive notions. Eventually Luciano and Bumpy strike a deal and Dutch finds himself out in the cold. Suddenly gangster gunfire chops down a young innocent numbers runner. Now Bumpy's cronies think that he has gone too far. Francine bails out on him more out of the formulaic dictates of the story than for any motivated reason. So do the filmmakers. The second half of the movie shows Bumpy losing favor with everybody.The film's publicity notes claim that Hoodlum is complete fiction but historical characters populate the story. Of course movies rarely recreate history with any fidelity. History is more chaotic than dramatic so filmmakers recast it to fit their dramatic formulas. One way is by cutting the number of characters. Refusing to portray these events as they actually occurred Duke and Brancato blow a fantastic opportunity to exploit their melodramatic potential. Duke whose directorial credits include Deep Cover and A Rage in Harlem wrestles with the obvious lapses in Brancato's script. The length of Hoodlum may have been cut by the studio to squeeze in more showings in a single evening. The action grows and takes on an episodic quality when Bumpy becomes callous. After the first half the film's momentum bogs down and Hoodlum loses its air of fun. The time has come for the characters to pay the piper.The filmmakers embrace a curious morality. In most gangster movies the hoodlum hero must die. Bumpy gets off easy as does Luciano and only Dutch antes up with his life. Duke and Brancato allow their criminals greater leniency. The gangsters are less cancerous than the defenders of justice. Consequently Hoodlum concludes on an anticlimax. Moreover the filmmakers neglect to post an epilogue about Bumpy's outcome. For the record the gangster who hires Shaft to find his kidnapped daughter in Shaft is a variation on Bumpy as is the kingpin mobster in American Gangster with Denzel Washington. The problem with Brancato's script is its uneven quality. The actionpacked first half is more entertaining than the tedious longwinded second half. The filmmakers glorify Bumpy initially as a Robin Hood gangster who steals from a rival mob and gives to Harlem's starving citizens.Fishburne is riveting as a toughasnails but warmhearted criminal. Roth takes top acting honors however as Dutch Schultz and looks like he had a ball exaggerating those vile elements in Schultz's psychotic behavior. Garcia epitomizes sartorial urbanity as the peacemaking Italian gangster who divides his time between Bumpy Dutch and special prosecutor Dewey. Atherton's egotistical special prosecutor bristles with revulsion in his dealings with these crooks but accepts their bribes. The filmmakers make the repressive Dewey appear particularly loathsome a Judas whose contempt for the mob is exceeded only by his mockery of justice.Despite some flavorful dialogue Hoodlum plays it straight down the line as a dramatic shoot'em up. Audiences expecting a variation on Eddie Murphy's Harlem Nights may leave this Fishburne film disappointed. Although it's no Godfather Hoodlum is definitely aboveaverage and far beyond those 1970s camp classics that headlined Fred Williamson as the black Caesar of crime in Hell Up in Harlem. If you enjoy gangster epics Hoodlum is worth the price of admission. Some critics have savaged Hoodlum for its debatable morality. Ironically Bumpy rises to the summit of his profession. At fadeout however Duke and Brancato show that the gangster's life is one that leaves you standing alone in the rain outside the church door without a friend.".

Bumpy who works for Madame Queen comes up with a plan for eliminating the problem of Dutch by getting Lucky Luciano Andy Garcia another gangster and Dutch in a fight.  This movie is a classic gangster movie.'";

	schema:reviewBody "Hoodlum is the story black a black underclass gangster who stands toetotoe with the Italian and Jewish Mafia in Harlem during 1930's in the great depression era. I checked out the story from watching the movie on Sunday and what I can say that yes there were several factual occurrences that took place during that time however Hoodlum ends up turning itsself into some sort action flick rather than a factual account of what really happened having said that it is still a very entertaining movie to watch and has some good performances as well as well made action scenes. Laurence Fishburne was excellent as the charming and wise Bumpy Johnson who shows us an educated black man not afraid to stand up for what he believes in Tim Roth was excellent as the unstable Ducth Schultz although I found myself comparing him to Joe Pesci at times  and Andy Garcia as Lucy Lucoina was good with his screen time however I felt the stand out performance was Cicley Tyson who portrayed a very strong elegant  proud Black woman. The movie rolled on fast and got into the swing straight away  there was good use of makeup  wardrobe and scenery which gave us a feel of 1930's Harlem. The interaction between characters is good as it gives us a real feel of what life was like back then. However the problems with Hoodlum are that the script seems a little superficial and characters which can have real depth to them normal end up being well quite flat. The film was supposed to be about real life events but it just seems to way to far fetched to the point where it does feel like a no brain action movie and the action itself seems to be titfortat repetitive although Fishburane's performance keeps you guessing how will he strike back and thusly the second half of the movie just feels messy and rushed. To conclude Hoodlum is probably not one of the best gangster movies about the black era to come I mean it is over shadowed by the likes of American Gangster but it does however manage to entertain on a big scale and is not a waste of time  its just a shame with a few clear faults in it however I would recommend as a rental and worth a check out for fans of the gangster genre.HOODLUM  8.1 OUT OF 10POWER IS MEASURED IN ENEMIES...".

Johnson fresh from a stint in prison goes to work for successful Harlem numbers racketeer Stephanie St. Clair Cicely Tyson then takes over the operation when she is sent to prison. His approach unsurprisingly is much different and more proactive than hers which comes in handy when they are forced to deal with the activities of Arthur Flegenheimer a.k.a. Dutch Schultz Tim Roth a pathologically greedy flamboyantly nasty creep just full of swagger.Fishburne commands the screen with his calm and cool performance as Bumpy. His Bumpy is a man never caught off guard a man with his own philosophy and way of life that prevents him from wanting to enter churches. His love story in this fictionalization is Francine Hughes played by the lovely Vanessa L. Williams who adds a great deal of humanity to the scenario as she tries to distance herself from Bumpys' actions even when she is clearly acting in self defense as she shoots a would be assassin she feels very uneasy about it.Andy Garcia is merely passable as mob boss of the day Lucky Luciano but there are plenty of other despicable antagonists to raise the ire of the audience. Richard Bradford plays a corrupt police captain calling to mind his role in The Untouchables except that here his character is a racist as well. William Atherton plays real life attorney Thomas Dewey who is portrayed as being just as crooked as anyone in this tale. The radiant Tyson shines in her limited screen time. Chi McBride supplies both comedy relief and a level of heart as Bumpys' cousin Illinois Gordon and Loretta Devine is likable as his lady friend. Queen Latifah isn't given much to do in her small supporting role. Some very fine character actors dot the landscape Clarence Williams III real life brothers Mike and Beau Starr Paul Benjamin Joe Guzaldo Ed O'Ross J.W. Smith Eddie Bo Smith Jr. and John TolesBey. Roth tends to steal the show although there's nothing subtle about his performance or the way that Schultz is written.On the technical side some reasonably good period recreation is done Bill Duke directs with style and there's a lovely score by Elmer Bernstein as well as a few musical numbers.Hoodlum is decent entertainment but that's what it is entertainment. It's only loosely based on the real stories of the real life people involved so it isn't to be mistaken for a history lesson.Seven out of 10.".

William Atherton plays real life attorney Thomas Dewey who is portrayed as being just as crooked as anyone in this tale. The radiant Tyson shines in her limited screen time. Chi McBride supplies both comedy relief and a level of heart as Bumpys' cousin Illinois Gordon and Loretta Devine is likable as his lady friend. Queen Latifah isn't given much to do in her small supporting role. Some very fine character actors dot the landscape Clarence Williams III real life brothers Mike and Beau Starr Paul Benjamin Joe Guzaldo Ed O'Ross J.W. Smith Eddie Bo Smith Jr. and John TolesBey. Roth tends to steal the show although there's nothing subtle about his performance or the way that Schultz is written.On the technical side some reasonably good period recreation is done Bill Duke directs with style and there's a lovely score by Elmer Bernstein as well as a few musical numbers.Hoodlum is decent entertainment but that's what it is entertainment. It's only loosely based on the real stories of the real life people involved so it isn't to be mistaken for a history lesson.Seven out of 10.";

	schema:reviewBody "Hoodlum 1997 Dir Bill Duke  Cast Laurence Fishburne Tim Roth Andy Garcia Vanessa Williams Cicely Tyson Well made gangster film that evaporates into a litter of bullets. It regards lower standards of living and hostile attitude. Based on a true story in the 1930's Harlem with a triangle turf battle in motion. Laurence Fishburne leads the patrol against Tim Roth and Andy Garcia. He is smart and tough but unable to balance his personal life with romance. Bodies pile up and nobody really wins in the end. The concept still holds interest although the screenplay grows repetitious and weary. Director Bill Duke does a fine job with fantastic art direction. This film successfully captures the period for which it addresses but perhaps a tighter screenplay would have been beneficial. Fishburne holds his own as a gangster trying to be the gangster and the romantic interest. This will not work to his favour. Vanessa Williams delivers a strong performance as his love interest who is questioning the lifestyle he is involved in. Roth and Garcia overact as the two other opposing gang leaders who will end up on the receiving end of bad luck. This is not terrible filmmaking but the screenplay isn't as ambitious as it could have been. It does succeed in present the period for which it represents. Its purpose is to create the reality of gang lifestyles but the screenplay has more bark than bite. Score 6  10".

For those of you who don't Johnson was a member of an organized crime group in Harlem during the 1930's. He was also the man who mentored and inspired Denzel Washington's character of Frank Lucas in American Gangster. Long before that film the story of Bumpy Johnson was told in Hoodlum. This was one of those little told stories about the mafia that started out very strong. Unfortunately I felt that the writers went into far too much detail at certain points in the film and by the end it was definitely dragging on. Laurence Fishburne stars as Johnson and did an adequate job my problem with his has always been he lacks emotion in his acting. In my humble opinion this should automatically disqualify him from certain things and this probably should have been one of those things. Tim Roth is Dutch Schultz and while Schultz had a reputation for being a character Roth went a little over the top with it but was still very entertaining. My favorite performance was of course the one by Andy Garcia as Lucky Luciano but he really wasn't in the film much and that's a shame because nobody plays a crime boss better than hen does. Hoodlum is a wild ride about an incredible true story but as a film it was a mix of terrific scenes and some slower unnecessary elements. As a film it's not the best but it's worth watching just for the amazing story that is being told.".

	schema:headline " A movie about power and the tragedy of stubbornness";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a movie set in the 1930's in Harlem. It is the height of the depression and a Negro Bumpy Johnson has just been released from gaol. He returns to find that the Queen's gambling racket is being threatened by a white man from downtown. Everybody in Harlem is happy with the way things are  people play the numbers game and win enough to put food on the table. But numbers is a very big business and the mafia wants a piece of it. The mafia boss of the time Lucky Lucino is content to let it go but one of his underlings wants a piece of the action and soon a gang war breaks out.This is the typical interwar style movie with corrupt cops and politicians and crime running rife. The prohibition years are over but people are making money now by other rackets and the American system of brutal monopoly is leaving blood on the streets and the corrupt politicians are supporting those who have the most money. It is a time of lawlessness and strife and in a way we should feel glad we don't live there. Another thing about the time is that the Negro is still very much in the underclass and there is a lot of prejudice and tension between the races.The major theme here is how power corrupts. The Queen is taken to gaol and she gives Bumpy the business to run. Bumpy is a very intelligent man but he is also very stubborn. He refuses to give into the nonNegros and will continue to fight until one is dead. Unfortunately his stubbornness brings about the death of many innocent people. During this time his girlfriend walks out on him and his cousin begins to disown him yet he refuses to give in because he believes he is right.This movie really looks at the tragedy of this but it is not that tragic because Bumpy soon sees how he has changed and will begin to change before it is too late. But then with the death of his cousin one can argue it is too late. His girlfriend has left and chastises him for being so stubborn that he refuses to step into a church to pay respects for one of the dead. He finally steps into a church to pay respect to his cousin and then walks straight out. As such we see the beginning of a change but we don't follow through with it. The problems have been solved and Harlem has its autonomy  what happens to Bumpy in the future is for the future.".

Also Andy Garcia does a good job portraying Lucky Luciano. I think that this movie had all the elements of a good movie but it just got shafted a little. I'm not saying it's Goodfellas but if you like that movie then there is no reason why you would not like this one. I love the story behind this movie and the subplot of his relationship with Vanessa Williams. and I must admit that I do like this movie because I love crime family dramas and it is nice to see one with black people starring in it showing what part they played in that world  back in that time frame. I would suggest to anyone who likes gangster and mafia movies to go see this one. If you want to learn about the history of organized crime back in the 20's and 30's then this is a great way to get a feel for that time! This movie gets nothing but rave reviews from me ".

	schema:reviewBody "I am not surprised to see mostly negative reviews for Fulci's 1987 Carrie inspired Aenigma. It does not stand up to his late 70'searly 80's gore epics that you all are familiar with. But wait let's remember that Fulci is still visually inventive in 87 with lots of great camera moves and flair. The man knew how to tell a story folks. He may have been a jerk to his colleagues but what a great craftsman. He was trying to make a US style teenager quasi slasher popcorn movie here a lighter less horrifying type of deal. I think it should also be said that this was well cast. The beautiful college girls each play their roles with unique personalities something you won't find in most US films of this type. The geeky girl in the red dress is a hoot and so is the famous snail scene. Best of all is the English new wavepop sappy romance song that sets up the audience perfectly. It's an interesting and engaging story even if it is clearly inspired by Carrie. And unlike so many other horror films the ending is rewarding logical AND suspenseful. I still haven't seen a Fulci film that I don't like and this is no exception...check it out!".

	schema:reviewBody "At a school for wayward girls that would give any BritishAustralian TV presenterentertainer from the seventies a stroke a prank has gone way way wrong. Cathy the weirdo daughter of the weirdo cleaner has been set up on a date with Fred the gym instructor more on him later. After being given a horrendous eighties make up job by her two 'friends' to the tune of horrendous eighties song that wouldn't be out of place on a Bowie album from the same era she sets out with Fred who puts the moves on her. What Cathy doesn't know is that everyone else at the school and their boyfriends are all listening in and shortly chase her around in their cars causing her to be run over.Now in a coma and because this is a Fulci film we get to see Cathy's spirit float above a model town with some leftover model buildings from The New Gladiators  I wonder if Fulci kept them in the same cupboard as Jared Martin who stars in both films. She decides to possess the body of new pupil Eva who's goal in life is to shag as many men as possible. There's about six other actresses playing pupils in this film but for the life of me I can't remember any of their names.Eva's first port of call is Fred. Now he's not in the film long but he's worth a mention. Fred is the gym teacher for the school and he loves to date the pupils slap them on the arse give them leg massages tell the pupils that they're fat and inadvertently cause them to get run over by cars. So Eva sets up a date with him but doesn't quite get there as his reflection comes to life and strangles him as they tend to do.Basically Fulci at some point has watched both Carrie and Patrick and thought Me too! Cathy is now possessing Eva and causing the deaths of all involved in her accident. At one point Eva throws a hissy fit which brings her to the attention of Doctor Jared Martin who of course is also Cathy's doctor and they hit it off.So the rest of the film plays out like you'd expect with those girls all meeting their demises in various surreal ways death by snail death by a statue coming to life in an art gallery after a picture comes to life and stabs itself raining blood on one of the girls a run of the mill falling out the window gag until Eva's family show up suddenly and take her home causing Jared to go out with yet another one of the girls. This doesn't make Cathy a happy camper.What surprised me after watching Aenigma was how it wasn't a pile of crap at all. In fact I quite enjoyed it! Judging by how ill Fulci looks when he makes his usual cameo I'm surprised he managed to make something that has an actual storyline see Manhattan Baby for the opposite of this. Sure it's your run of the mill late era Italian horror but the snails art gallery bit and completely original storyline if you haven't seen Patrick make it worth a watch. It's got all the visual trademark's of our Lucio and looks pretty good in general. The fake heads lookfaker than usual but that seems to go with the low budgets. Seriously see the fake head in Red Monks for a further example of the decline in fake head quality.".

Well sure it's not a patch on his earlier work but still it remains a remotely enjoyable bloodbath with some inventive killings the snails!! and an appealing cast of young  sexy schoolgirls. The story although highly unoriginal is easy to follow unpretentious and fastpaced. Black sheep of Catholic girl's dorm Kathy is involved in a nearfatal car accident after a prank with the school's gym teacher. Shortly after a new and extrovert girl makes her entry in the dorm but her mind seems controlled by the comatose Kathy. Through Eva Gordon Kathy and her spiritual mother see a chance for revenge starting with the death of the insufferable macho gym teacher. Fulci keeps the gore under control this time and focuses more on the brooding atmosphere. Aenigma features some beautiful camerawork although admittedly the same camera angles are often reused several times. The girls' acting is extremely hammy and it's a good thing they all all look so cute otherwise it would have been a lot more difficult to struggle yourself through the movie. Nothing spectacular or special but it certainly isn't terrible neither.".

	schema:reviewBody "When Italian goreman Lucio Fulci directed his infamous quartet of zombie movies ZOMBIE FLESH EATERS THE BEYOND CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD and HOUSE BY THE CEMETERY he got something right. Something clicked and these films became classics to the sweaty collector of video nasties even if they were classics for all the wrong reasons but of course there is always something irresistible about watching actors covered in flour eating people.However ever since then Fulci churned out bad film after bad film and the magic just wasn't there anymore. AENIGMA is one of Fulci's lesser items a diabolical mixture of the then current slasher trend something we now view with contempt with some vague insubstantial supernatural overtones. AENIGMA begins predictably with a school prank going wrong bringing to mind Cropsy's accidental burning in er THE BURNING leaving a strange bugeyed girl in a coma. Forget CARRIE this girl is seriously weird! Just her appearance is enough to send shivers down my spine. From the hospital bed she directs violence think PATRICK to those all around her possessing a 'beautiful' girl and then murdering off the perpetrators of the prank one by one in a string of absurd death scenes. The plot also manages to drag in the setting of SUSPIRIA too although the girl's school here lacks the atmospheric terror that filled Argento's movie. While Argento filled his school with frightening claustrophobia and nightmarish suspense Fulci fills his with bad hairdos and horrendous dialogue.Bookended by bad pop songs although there is a small bit of nice organ music full of incredibly cheesy clichd dialogue of the what a hunk kind all delivered straightfaced and all the more funny for it and a prime example of bad filmmaking  in one instance the screen goes black for more than five seconds in between different scenes which gives you some idea of the general incompetence all round. The acting is uniformly bad and nobody nobody registers on the sympathy scale always a bad sign I mean there aren't even any animals to sympathise with here. The only amusing person is the 'retarded' cleaner who bears an uncanny similarity to Martha from THE BEYOND although I'm sure that's only coincidental. One ageing bloke is apparently irresistible to the girls once again distancing this film from reality as far as possible.As usual with these kind of bad pictures the variety of death scenes is the only reason worth watching this film for. Well that is if you have to watch it as it's an experience I wouldn't recommend unless you're a really big fan of horror films and you know what to expect with this one. A gym instructor is killed when his reflection comes out of the mirror in a startlingly original moment although this brings back horrifying memories of the previous year's AEROBICIDE and was actually done better in EVIL DEAD 2 while another bloke goes THE BOGEY MAN route of being decapitated by a window a sight that always cracks me up  seeing an actor with his head stuck through a window and then the next second a bouncing rubbery thing which is supposed to be that same guy's bonce bouncing around outside!. A girl falls a short distance and apparently breaks her body while a doctor has a dream about having sex with a young girl and then being bitten and scratched to death by her in probably the most hard to stomach moment of the film literally encapsulating the mix of sex and violence prevalent in the modern horror movie.In another dream sequence a girl finds her dorm full of decapitated corpses while in the most artistic moment of the entire thing a lost girl in a museum is strangled by a statue which comes to life. Before this we see a priceless painting bleeding and this moment is the one true creative image in the whole film. The standout death this time around though obviously inspired by the spider attack in THE BEYOND is death by snails totally ludicrous of course but definitely a first. A girl asleep on her bed is enveloped by the sticky slimy snails and there is something deeply unpleasant with this attack as it pushes much the same buttons as SQUIRM and SLUGS. Unfortunately this is the one sobadit'sgood moment in a mediocre below average movie. If you want a good Fulci film then go for a zombie one  after all at least he was liberal with those guys. And don't ask me what the hell the title means either  I have absolutely no idea!".

The rest of the film is like a TV movie quite boring and absolutely not scary... Don't miss the appearance of the ghost on a Tom Cruise poster... Anyway it's a great film to watch with friends beer pizzas...The french dubbing sounds to be made very quickly Kathy's voice sounds like a man !!! love it...";

From the moment the opening credits come on you know it can't be good very bad 80's pop music and a girl that's putting makeup which makes her look even more ugly. Anyway the story isn't exactly original Ugly girl gets to be the victim of a prank by fellowstudents and ends up in a coma.

The acting's really bad all the time and the sound editing's rather sloppy too. But the directing isn't really too bad. There are a few nice cameramoves and two fine topshots of the school and the hospital which do look like miniatures by the way but still nice. Are there any more reasons to watch this flick? Well ehr... maybe the deathbysnailsscene kinda gross the museumsequence a decapitation and... a bizarre sexscene in a dream with our leadinggirl biting chunks out of the lovedoctor.But there isn't much gore actually considering Lucio Fulci made this. The movie itself never gets really boring due to the deaths and frequently intercut freaky shots of the creepy girl in a coma but the ending seemed like they just literally pulled the plug on this movie. It really hurts me a lot to flunk a Fulcimovie 'cause I'm a fan of some of his movies. Can't bring myself to give AENIGMA less than 4 stars though because it still feels like a Fulcimovie. If you're only an average horrorfan you should avoid this movie 'cause this is for Fulcifans only.".

	schema:reviewBody "I love bad movies and foreign films and I can find redeeming qualities in nearly ANY movie... I'm always critical of people who proclaim that a film is 'the worst movie ever made' but this one is almost deserving of being on a 'worst movies' list. The camerawork and acting rescues it from that fate... just barely. Admittedly on a scenebyscene basis there were a few effective moments  but it feels like the script was written in a single afternoon. Style without substance.In a very CARRIElike opening sequence Kathy Dragan Bjelogrlic is transformed from ugly duckling to... 1930s prostitute. She's soon humiliated by her peers and winds up in an accident that results in her becoming a permanent vegetable. She then leaves her body and possesses Eva Lara Naszinsky a new student with daddy issues who helps ? get revenge on the people who scorned Kathy.Though Fulci has his patented visual flair the film screams turkey and seems rife for a MST3K treatment. I'm not usually one to mock the screen but I couldn't help myself with this movie. The biggest problem is that the story and dialogue or at least the English dubbing are laughably absurd yet the actors are playing it straight. It reminds me of an Ed Wood film that's completely oblivious to its own badness. My condolences to the cast who made the best of what they were given. The film is set in the USA posters of Tom Cruise Sly Stallone Yoda and Snoopy adorn dorm walls but little care was put into researching American dorm life and absolutely no care was put into researching medical facilities and jargon. The effects are terrible almost across the board. The three exceptions are a creepy mirror scene an erotic sex scene that takes a nasty turn and a deathbysnail sequence that's uncomfortably well played though still ridiculous. Unfortunately a later scene with a menacing snake wasn't as effective  we cut from silly reaction shots to inserts of a snake slithering across the floor. Oogabooga. Then this scene goes from dopey to unintentionally hilarious. To top it all off it's unclear WHY Kathy possesses Eva. Eva doesn't actually kill anyone unless she did during one of the numerous times when my mind started wandering and Kathy never actively takes over her body. I could've choked down a specterlike out of body experience but the possession seems completely pointless.There are only three instances when I'd recommend this film. First if you're gonna have a big party and are looking for a film to mock while you and your friends get hammered. Second if you're looking for a textbook example of how NOT to write a story. And third if you're a diehard Fulci fan. If you're looking for a scary movie or under any other circumstances beware. Get one of Fulci's earlier horror movies instead.".

Set in a school it involves a misunderstood loner called Kathy who is cruelly taunted by her classmates but takes revenge by means of psychic powers. So far so Carrie. But here the cruel prank puts the victim into a coma and it's from here that she wreaks havoc which echoes Patrick. She somehow manages to possess another student who goes through the school leaving a trail of destruction and death on Kathy's behalf.Sounds great for Fulci fans but don't hold your breath. The various revenge murders are all very unimpressive and often ridiculous including death by being scared of a museum and death by being confronted with a boyfriend's corpse! What's wrong with these people!? The film has no highlights of gore whatsoever which is a major shortcoming in a Fulci film. Even it's set piece murder a death by snails sequence will probably leave you laughing how exactly do snails manage to overpower someone??. This along with the film's title makes me think that Fulci is actually trying to emulate Argento's far superior Phenomeona.The film is generally pretty confusing as Kathy's power and her hold over the possessed girl are never properly explained. The acting is awful the lead character the possessed student wanders around looking totally bored so you won't really care about any of the characters. It's also ugly and dull to look at even though Fulci tries to ape Argento yet again by bathing many shots in lurid coloured lighting mostly a tiresome bright blue but it just doesn't add up to anything coherent. The dubbing is poor as usual ans there's a really REALLY bad ballad being crooned over the prologue when Kathy is looking forward to her big night out! Even Fulci completists could rest easy without ever watching this one. A real stinker.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's commonly agreed by Eurohorror enthusiasts that Fulci's talents began to rapidly diminish following his deeply offensive but also incredibly awesome 1982 giallo The New York Ripper. Having seen his interesting but snailpaced A Cat in the Brain 1990 and his depressingly awful Demonia 1990 I was inclined to agree but my positive reaction to The Devil's Honey a terrific sadoerotic drama from 1986 made me more interested in checking out his latterday efforts. Aenigma is often singled out for ridicule by viewers and to an extent I can see why. Commonly referred to as a Carrie ripoff but even more derivative of Patrick 1978 Aenigma chronicles a comatose's girl's psychic revenge on her catty schoolmates and hunky gym teacher after they pull a cruel prank on her. Having been hit by a car after fleeing the humiliating scene in which the gym teacher pretended to seduce her she possesses a new classmate named Eva played by Lara Lamberti and begins to pick off her tormentors in increasingly bizarre ways. Things are complicated when the promiscuous Eva begins an illicit affair with a dreamboat doctor an often befuddled Jared Martin whose subsequent relationship with another student draws the jealous wrath of Eva and her possessor. This revenge story is often nonsensical and at times downright comical but Fulci brings some of the same artistry and imagination that made his earlier thrillers so effective. The cinematography by Luigi Ciccarese is sometimes flat and has that hazy soft focus and heavy blue gel lighting that plagued so many films in the eighties but becomes more nuanced and colorful in the film's supernatural scenes. A sequence in which a girl is smothered to death by snails is usually singled out for derision and it does come across as a misguided attempt by Fulci to outdo the spider attack scene from The Beyond 1981 but I admire Fulci's balls in trying to make snails scary. It doesn't work but he later provides more effective jolts in a nightmarish museum death scene in which the exhibits come to life and attack one of the villainous schoolgirls. Overall a lesser effort from the prolific Fulci but far more entertaining than I'd been led to believe and it still gives the impression that an artist is behind the camera struggling against all odds to inject some originality and style into a derivative and underfunded commercial venture.".

It's just one bad moment out of many bad moments in a very bad film.nigma opens with a young woman named Kathy Milijana Zirojevic excitedly preparing for a date with the help of her friends by selecting a nasty red dress and plastering on her makeup like a clown.

Unfortunately Fulci is not quite in the same league as Argento when it comes to creating stunning visuals and a dreamlike atmosphere and the result is a rather bland and unmemorable effort that leaves one longing for some yucky eyeball trauma or a bit of messy brain scrunching to spice things up.The story a weak mix of elements stolen from several much better films doesn't make much sense no explanation is given for how Kathy can conjure up snails and in one equally silly scene animate a marble statue and the majority of the cast is pretty lousy. The only recognisable name in the film recognisable to fans of lowbudget trash I mean is Bmovie star Jared Martin who is totally wasted in his role as a neurologist although he does get to roll around naked with a lightlyoiled Naszinsky which would be a fair enough reason for taking the gig!.nigma is one for Fulci fans who like me have seen all of his better known films already and are now just ticking off the other titles from his filmography for the sake of completion.".

	schema:reviewBody "Aenigma appears to be Lucio Fulci's attempt at 'Suspiria' as the plotting atmosphere locations and characters are all similar and while this isn't essentially a 'bad' film it certainly has nothing on Dario Argento's masterpiece. The influence from American cinema seems to have affected the great Italian maestro Lucio Fulci on this film as he uses cheesy eighties songs a lot and the way the plot plays out feels a lot like an American slasher with the focus being kept on the kill scenes and bedtime activities of most of the school girls. The film forsakes logic at almost every turn and much of the plot isn't explained and doesn't make a lot of sense. The central theme of a young injured girl possessing several members of her school and taking revenge on those that wronged her springs to mind immediately as this isn't explained at all and that makes it hard to buy into the film. The way that Fulci handles this plot isn't very good either as we are never made to care for her plight and therefore the fact that the plot doesn't make sense is made all the more irritating.Fulci does well with the atmosphere in the film and the cinematography is rather nice also. As you would expect from a director who made his name with a whole load of blood and guts there is no shortage of death scenes in this film. These scenes range from featuring severed limbs to gratuitous stabbings but strangely enough these scenes feel rushed and Fulci doesn't deliver a great deal of gore which is probably the main reason why this film doesn't often get a very good writeup. Lucio Fulci has a bigger filmography than you would think and many of his lesser known films  such as The Devil's Honey and Don't Torture a Duckling turn out to be his best. This film however is one of the director's more average efforts on the whole. I don't think Fulci really cared too much about the supernatural angle of the story and so the film has ended up being disjointed and illogical. The acting and dialogue does nothing to alter this fact as both are poor even for an Italian horror film. To be honest I don't rate Aenigma as a complete dead loss although it should be noted that I'm more tolerant of Fulci's films than most.".

	schema:headline " Fulci Meets Carrie";
	schema:reviewBody "Aenigma 1987  12 out of 4 Italian horror from Fulci is his spin on the CARRIEtype tale. The film takes place at a female boarding school where one of the unpopular girls has a prank played on her which leaves her in a coma. Soon after that a new girl enters the school and becomes possessed with the coma girl's spirit which leaves to revenge. This is one of the director's least known films and there's probably a reason for that. Considering that it's not very good and that it came towards the end of the Italian horror craze it's no wonder the movie has been forgotten over the past couple decades. This film should be remembered somewhat better just because of some of the horrid death sequences which are the real reason to watch this film. There's not too much gore but we get an incredibly bizarre sex scene where our hero eats away at her lover. If that wasn't strange enough we get perhaps the dumbest death sequence in Fulci career and that's the scene where a girl just lays in bed while snails kill her. Yes snails. The other death scenes are pretty generic although Fulci does wrap them up in a nice atmosphere and one sequence inside a museum works pretty well. There's a subplot involving the new girl dating the coma girl's doctor but this just drags things down. The performances aren't anything special but they're not too bad either. In other words typical Italian stuff. If someone is new to Fulci then they shouldn't start here but if you must watch everything the guy made then jump right in.".

We witness and share his hopes and anxieties from squeezing out the cloth he used to mop up the vodka from the bottle he'd just broken into a toothbrush cup his other mental and physical angsts and the very real situations of power cuts and strikes that affect everything such as the phones.As Winkiel gets down to the task of reporting on the uprising from the inside especially of the charismatic leader of the striking shipbuilders Maciek Tomczyk whose father was killed in the riots of 1970 and whose wife was detained. As the journalist interviews those around and who know Tomczyk scenes are recreated including the occasional use of actual news footage which illustrate the various strands leading up to the strike.Obviously a lot more than this goes into a riveting two and a half hour film but hopefully with your appetite whetted you'll now want to try it yourself. There's a whole canvas here on which Poland is painted and it's an absolutely fascinating one but still well enough made to be both informative and entertaining.Highly recommended for those who like me want to expand their World Cinema repertoire beyond the easily availablepopular but still want to play safe as this is a universal film that just happens to made in the Polish language.

	schema:reviewBody "Poland's historical and turbulent political moment is captured in a part documentary and part fiction film directed by Andrzej Wajda in Man of Iron a sequel of Man of Marble another classic directed by him. The film is very similar to its predecessor which is a very good film and that's why to some it might seen a repetitive thing except that this one took a more political approach to the story seemed more real the situations presented. It is inferior than the previous film but it is very good too.Here a reporter has the assignment to cover shipyard strikers led by Maciej Tomczyk Jerzy Radziwilowicz and members of the Solidarity Union that are fighting for better work conditions and against the abuses of political authorities. The reporter is told by his bosses to make the news about this man and other people will take his notes and all to make something against the leader something to make him look bad but while covering the protests and finding more and more information about Maciej's past the reporter gets divided by the whole situation without knowing in which side to stay with his controlling bosses that work for the government or with the strikers.Wajda uses the same technique to present the story by developing flashbacks that tells us the life of Maciej and more interesting he concludes the almost inconclusive story of Man of Marble the ending scene from that film appears in Man of Iron in the middle and from there we are able to see what happened to those characters asking some questions about the film made by the documentary. To fully understand Man of Iron watch the 1977 film is necessary otherwise it will be a confusing and difficult experience to understand the characters motivations emotions the political background also you need to research more about what happened in Poland between 1960's and 1980's.I liked this film because of its involvement with a noble cause which was the strikes made by the Solidarity Union and the way Wajda was able to use this to make a relevant sequel of a great film yet is not a movie selling a group or a political movement it is a statement of how things were changing and who were the people behind these changes. Wajda directed this film during the controversial period after all the government tended to persecute his oppositors and this film could be considered as a opposite propaganda so the director took a lot of chance to make this wonderful film a situation that resembles the one confronted by the female filmmaker in Man of Marble who is trying to make a film thesis about Maciej's father but she doesn't get enough assistance from her bosses that work for the Socialist regime.The importance of this film was big enough during the time of its release since there was a sense of lack of information about how Solidarity was changing things in Poland and a movie like this that combines archive footage of the real events and includes a cameo by Lech Walesa was important to make their cause famous around the world. The great prestige was the Palm D'Or at Cannes something that was viewed by many as a recognition to the movement and not much of stating that this was a great film. Indeed I think that it combines both since both were triumphant and Walesa few years away would be elected Poland's President. The things that made this an inferior film compared to the previous film is the political subject and the way it was used in the film in extended dialogues and scenes that were a little distracting and some confusion in the presentation. The screenplay covered a more complex subject and intertwine the flashbacks reminding us about some of the characters and bring back memories from the first film. As you see it's very difficult to put altogether but the film succeeds in its great message. More of the humanistic aspect of being involved in solidarity and strikes than the far too rational political theme would make this film ten times better than it is. As both films points out knowing the past is very important so that we can built a better future and viewers pay attention to the past moments presented here so that you can understand their future and all of their struggle. 910".

	schema:headline " The establishment of a catholic union in a Bolshevist state";
	schema:reviewBody "I believe that the true value of a film lies in the clear exposition of his message nonverbal if need be. Twoedged narratives are not my cup of tea unless any kind of siding is in reason impossible. In this latter case the message is actually nothing but the complexity of life. On the face of it the Polish film Man of Iron has main characters with a mixed message. Winkel is a reporter who appears to be fairly satisfied with the Bolshevist regime and lives the life of a fellowtraveler. He tries to do a good job and steer clear of any extremism. On the other hand Maciej Tomczyk is an intellectual who continuously tries to stretch the freedom that is given by law. He regularly lands in prison for a few weeks or months on the ground of petty verdicts such as littering with pamphlets he assures the court that they were all picked up. The characters are embedded in the true happenings at the Gdansk shipyard around 1980. The workers go on strike and occupy the shipyard because they demand the recognition of their union Solidarinosc Solidarity. The perseverance in this strike shows that something big is at stake. Tensions are rising. In the Netherlands the shipyard would probably have been cleared after a while or the union would have called off the strike. So one can grasp the confusion of the regime who no longer wants to exercise violence against the people that they employ and profess to represent. Remember that in this case the state is synonymous with the enterpriseowner. Of course one might argue that the occupation is simply a plea for political democracy but I tend to disagree. Nowhere it is suggested for instance to allow liberal parties. Here the opposition has limited goals. The deeper essence of the story seems to be that trade unions are indispensable irrespective of the social system that we live in. Finally an agreement is reached the regime gives in and the workers celebrate their victory. What does this mean for the integrity of the main characters that demand our attention for several hours? who has an evident claim on our sympathy Winkel Tomczyk or both? You need to interpret the society and the illinformed viewer feels somewhat lost. Although I boost my expertise With respect to the GDR EastGermany here the situation is clearly different. The GDR was at least formally a multiparty state  although this did not guarantee democracy. On the other hand independent unions remained absent. Since Lech Walesa Anna Walentynowicz and Jerzy Borowczak play themselves the narrative apparently shows the perspective of Solidarinosc and may be called union propaganda if you will. But independent unions appear in all sorts and conditions. Tne story suggests a workers'loyalty towards the catholic church which comes as a surprise considering that in the Netherlands the catholic unions faded already in the sixties. The Polish people are obviously different among others due to the relatively large population of conservative small farmers. We simply witness the establishment of a catholic union in a Bolshevist state. Now we can understand the reporter representing the interests of the media who appreciates the freedom and objectivity accompanying social pluriformity and embraces Solidarinosc after its formal recognition but not a moment sooner. And we can empathize with the recalcitrant intellectual who protests against the repression of the working class. Therefore the state of permanent confusion that pervades all characters in the film seems justified. Vehement emotions emerge only with the characters representing the most stubborn Bolshevist fanatics who sense their forthcoming superfluity and oblivion a circumstance that is also portrayed nicely in the SouthAmerican film El juego de Arcibel surprisingly about a journalist as well. Even in the scene where the reporter wildly thrashes a punchingball in all likelihood he just mirrors the thoughts of the nearby security police. Or do we glimpse at the professional frustrations in a strongly controlled society? Deep inside Winkel would undoubtedly have preferred a social drink. Anyway in general we just witness people negotiating and groping for moderate social reform.".

Winkiel Marian Opania is a burnedout alcoholic journalist and youthful radical assigned to look into Tomczyk's activities she uses her reputation to her advantage forming an understanding with him while at the same time searching for something to slander him. However as she interviews Tomczyk's associates and his detained wife hears about his painfully difficult times and the death of his father killed in the December 1970 protests she feels sympathy towards him and is forced to reconsider her actions even siding with the strikers and putting her career at risk. Also starring Wieslawa Kosmalska as Wieslawa Hulewicz or Anna Irena Byrska as Anna Hulewicz's mother Matka Hulrwicz and Boguslaw Linda as Dzidek. To be honest I found the previous film much more interesting especially because it was much easier to understand it is not the subtitles that cause most problems the film feels too political and that is not something I am always keen to watch occurring there were bits and pieces that were alright it's not something I can see myself watching again but I know it's not a bad drama.

Debord was a leading member of the avantgarde art movement 'Situationist International'. This cinematic essay uses their method of 'dtournement' to decontextualize and rearrange preexisting audiovisual materials and texts to critizise them and create new meaning. The result is a subversive collage of ideological moving images from socialist and capitalist societies that are presented here as artefacts of a global media 'spectacle' Social relations between people are mediated by artificial images and false representations that transform humans into mere passive consumers and 'spectators' of their alienated existence. Guy Debord's motivation was to create a radical social critique and a disruptive antiillusionist cinema as an antidote and revolutionary tool against the dominant cultural and sociopolitical forces of his time.";

	schema:reviewBody "This film by Guy E. Debord is based on his 1967 book of the same title both of which convey ideas about the consumer capitalism's mode of production and the effects on everyday life. Though both sources use a different means of communication they both powerfully convey the ideas of the situationists. I wont rant on about the ideas contain within this film which are quite profound and have influenced heavily on the AntiCapitalist movement and poststructuralism through thinkers like Jean Baudrillard. The structure of the film itself is a series of shots from Hollywood films to soviet 'collective hero' film experiments to softcore pornnothing past topless to archival footage of historical eventse.g. May 68 revolt in France and representations of everyday life. The way in which the scenes are manipulated work well with the voice over commentary reinforcing the ideas while hitting emotional notes. The Music also contributes well to the emotional sentiment which the director wants to be associated with different ideas and issues. The technique used reminds me of Wagner how he used the structure of music to convey hopelessness and the philosophy of Schopenhauer in The Ring covering over the once socialists allegory for the contradiction of modernity. Debord and the situationists used their music to convey of the feeling of hope and the spirit negation the negation of capitalism and the creation of a new 'totality' of 'situations'. Debord during this film highlights the influences of the 'situationits' in the agitation for May 68 the largest general strike in history. Henri Lefebvre criticized Debord on this point expressing the view that the situationists greatly exaggerate their influence on events. Other then the selfpampering which is small fraction of the film it is a well done piece of radical documentary both in form and content style and ideas though this dichotomy is to come degree false which is quite interesting just for those uninterested or hostile towards Revolutionary AntiCapitalism.This film can be hard to find being played at university film theater's and art festivals. But because the creators of this work are 'anticommodity' you can find the film online from different locations with English subtitles.".

Debord is based on his 1967 book of the same title both of which convey ideas about the consumer capitalism's mode of production and the effects on everyday life. Though both sources use a different means of communication they both powerfully convey the ideas of the situationists. I wont rant on about the ideas contain within this film which are quite profound and have influenced heavily on the AntiCapitalist movement and poststructuralism through thinkers like Jean Baudrillard. The structure of the film itself is a series of shots from Hollywood films to soviet 'collective hero' film experiments to softcore pornnothing past topless to archival footage of historical eventse.g. May 68 revolt in France and representations of everyday life. The way in which the scenes are manipulated work well with the voice over commentary reinforcing the ideas while hitting emotional notes. The Music also contributes well to the emotional sentiment which the director wants to be associated with different ideas and issues. The technique used reminds me of Wagner how he used the structure of music to convey hopelessness and the philosophy of Schopenhauer in The Ring covering over the once socialists allegory for the contradiction of modernity. Debord and the situationists used their music to convey of the feeling of hope and the spirit negation the negation of capitalism and the creation of a new 'totality' of 'situations'. Debord during this film highlights the influences of the 'situationits' in the agitation for May 68 the largest general strike in history. Henri Lefebvre criticized Debord on this point expressing the view that the situationists greatly exaggerate their influence on events. Other then the selfpampering which is small fraction of the film it is a well done piece of radical documentary both in form and content style and ideas though this dichotomy is to come degree false which is quite interesting just for those uninterested or hostile towards Revolutionary AntiCapitalism.This film can be hard to find being played at university film theater's and art festivals. But because the creators of this work are 'anticommodity' you can find the film online from different locations with English subtitles.";

It consists of black and white footage of crowds bullying soldiers and masses of people punctuated everyone once in a while by topless women writhing and pawing at their bodies and one scene of a young male pop singer silently writhing on the ground as if having an epileptic fit. The sound track is in French. I think the script was possibly composed by computer stringing together random abstract nouns. The effect is hypnotic and meaningless though oddly depressing.There is only the most tenuous thematic relationship between the narration and the video. I kept thinking the movie was over and it would pick up again like some nightmare I could not wake from. It was amateurish and incredibly self indulgent and self important. The film could have been easily condensed to 60 seconds to put across its message that civilisation imposes conformity and an empty pursuit of commodities.".

His wife refuses to accompany him to the town where they once lived because as the head of a local Party committee she had to fire a teacher which caused a scandal whose exact nature is never explained except through the coded use of a key year in Polish history 1956 and she has no interest in returning to the site of her humiliation. Their daughter seems feckless and irredeemable moving through a succession of men residences and jobs and in her fathers estimation abortions.The committee of the locality had been petitioning the Central government for years to improve the backward conditions of the area and now at last it was their turn. There were dissidents to be sure. Those who bemoan the destruction of a 200 year old forest and acres of meadows. There are those who live either on the site or in the path of the highways that will have to built to access the site or the town which will house the workers and they'll have to be removed by force. All of which somewhat reluctantly Bednarz has to oversee. Yet he opines its painful for some but the best for the most people.A documentary filmmaker begins to film the project from the beginning and points out as they watch the forest being destroyed with brutal industrial efficiency that the next area over had large tracts of unused wasteland. But it isn't as economically backward so the factory goes here Bednarz replies mouthing the official line but not sounding quite convinced but again confident of the overall sense of things.There is one stumbling block at the beginning. The local party wants him to accept their choice for second in command rather than Bednarz's long time assistant. This man happens to be the very man whom his wife fired years before. Bednarz tries to be diplomatic about rejecting the suggestion but the Party insists. Bednarz acquiesces thus setting up another of Kieslowski's Faustian bargains and questionable ethical choices.The plant is built and cracks in the facade begin which include dropping solid pollution in a five mile shadow down wind. Protest graffiti are painted on the plant. Things break down. Quotas are not met. Bednarz talks with one of the higher ups and voices his doubts that in fact it had been a seriously flawed project from the beginning. The Party official shrugs his shoulders and says that at least their consciences are clear but Bednarz disagrees at least his conscience is not totally clear. He asks to be let out of the job.

Eventually the workers organize against conditions caught up in the wave of national discontent 1976 is another milestone year in recent Polish history and meets the demonstrators in front of his office by agreeing with them and joining their protest.Of course he is removed and despite other synopsises he seems to be quite content playing with his grandchild.This is the bare outline but by this point in his career Kieslowski was beginning to enrich his films with layers of meaning. Bednarz is established as an earnest and sincere character by turning down a large double apartment for a two room flat. One room is for his darkroom as he is a serious amateur photographer.The documentary filmmaker returns some years later to do a follow up documentary and acts as something of a Greek chorus to measure the evolution of both the project and Bednarz but also of wider public attitudes. The filmmaker is played by Michal Tarkowski who was the presumed sacrificial lamb in Kieslowsi's PERSONAL 1976. Bednarz assistant is played by Jerzy Stuhr who would star and cowrite Kieslowski's AMATOR 1979 CAMERA BUFF where he plays an amateur filmmaker turned documentarian. The conversation that Bednarz has where he attempts to resign recalls a scene in his friend and sometime boss Zanussi's film an excerpt of which is seen in AMATOR a film in which Zanussi actually appears as himself. Zanussi's protagonists are invariably engineers and scientists.His daughter gets pregnant again but this time will marry and have the baby. Her fianc turns out to be a photographer which is also satisfying for Bednerz. When the documentarian visits Bednarz he notices one large photo on the wall made during the liberation of Poland. The filmmaker notices a relative in the picture and realizes that he must be the child at the center of the photo. This trope would be developed in Kieslowski's later film where sometimes unexplained coincidences exist warps in the fabric of existence where non sequitur intersections in time and space produce non consequential crossing of paths the court scenes in THREE COLORS.Bednarz is a typical middle period protagonist type the man in the middle. He is trying to achieve a socially useful goal while acting as ethically as possible but torn by the needs of people below and the demands of people above. The center as Yeats says cannot hold and the only recourse is disengagement which is the tragic ending though it doesn't appear to be in BLIZNA THE SCAR.

	schema:reviewBody "Krzysztof Kieslowski became a highly appreciated arthouse director in Europe when he made his TVseries about The Ten Commandments Dekalog 1989. Later on in the 1990's he directed The Double Life of Veronique and The Three Colours trilogy which confirmed his position in the international arthouse. As most filmmakers do so did he start by making documentaries then he made two films for the Polish television and after that his first film for the big screen Blizna The Scar 1976.Kieslowski himself called the film horrible. He criticized its screenplay and categorized the film as socialist realism. He probably saw something I can never be able to see something that only the one who made the film could see. Blizna is a realistic film about a socialist society but socialist realism was never even close to realism. It's full of that blind optimism which Stalin so idealized. But Kieslowski's film Blizna is incredibly pessimistic it shows how socialism works how it doesn't work how it cannot work and how it's impossible for anyone to make a change in a society like that. However one shouldn't feel that Kieslowski was a man cheering for individualism market economy or economic liberalism. He always called himself unpolitical and criticism for the new capitalist Poland can be seen in his later film Three Colors White 1993.Blizna is a story about a corporation which decides to build a new factory in spite of ecology or the people living in the area. They choose a man with a family to lead the project. Quickly he reveals to be a man who takes responsibility and tries to finish the project with honor. He soon starts to see the flaws of the project where moral is only one defect. In his journey through Machiavellist politics he finds making a change incredibly difficult.The authorities of Poland didn't ban Blizna but they treated it badly and basically no one saw it until the producer of The Three Colours trilogy brought a bunch of films from Kieslowski's early career to the screen. Having seen Blizna today it might have partly lost its grip since it is tightly tied to its own time. The 1970's can be seen in just about everything in the style in the narrative in the dialog and in the costumes. This isn't a bad thing by any means but Blizna certainly isn't a timeless classic. But what it is is a good description of it's time. It shows how Poland worked in the 1970's under the socialist government how it did not worked. Kieslowski said in his interview book Kieslowski on Kieslowski by Danusia Stok how sad it is that no one takes responsibility on what happened during the era  not even today.Blizna is very pessimistic and has got inconsolable despair. It shows how impossible it was to make a change in Poland and how hopeless the era was. To put it briefly it's a satirical description of the authorities of Poland. It is funny political pessimistic and very interesting for those who love Kieslowski European arthouse or are interested in history of the 20th century.".

	schema:reviewBody "I only got the idea of this movie on the second time I saw it. It is actually like a documentary of a fictious character or who knows he didn't exist living in a socialist Poland who is being commissioned to conduct a new chemical factory. The movie shows quite realistic portrait of a man who tries to keep his values in order in the middle of all corruption and chaos of different social movements of the time. The movie doesn't go into any character's side actually but tries to display the difficulties of the system and how an individual is powerless in many ways.The storytelling is very slow and at times a bit jumpy. The music scenes of the movie that are very rare are quite bizarre almost eerie.I cannot recommend the movie to anyone who tend to fall asleep in slow dramas but those who like other Kieslowsky films or documentaries of socialism this is an interesting flick.".

It is actually like a documentary of a fictious character or who knows he didn't exist living in a socialist Poland who is being commissioned to conduct a new chemical factory. The movie shows quite realistic portrait of a man who tries to keep his values in order in the middle of all corruption and chaos of different social movements of the time. The movie doesn't go into any character's side actually but tries to display the difficulties of the system and how an individual is powerless in many ways.The storytelling is very slow and at times a bit jumpy. The music scenes of the movie that are very rare are quite bizarre almost eerie.I cannot recommend the movie to anyone who tend to fall asleep in slow dramas but those who like other Kieslowsky films or documentaries of socialism this is an interesting flick.";

	schema:reviewBody "Kieslowski did go on to better things later especially in his later and more internationally renowned period starting with 'Dekalog' all the way through to 'Three Colours Red'. 'The Scar' however is a highly impressive feature film debut.Like as was said for 'The Calm' a relatively obscure work and undeservedly so 'The Scar' doesn't have an awful lot wrong with it it's the sort of film that does almost everything correctly and with very good skill but it's also a case of Kieslowski's style and all his components while present and correct here became more refined later on. 'The Calm' does lack the intensity and emotional resonance of his later work especially with the best 'Dekalog' stories 'The Double Life of Veronique' and 'Three Colors Red' and 'Blue'.Maybe it does get a touch heavyhanded in places too then again that was not unexpected with themes as heavy and controversial as hypocrisy compromise and contradiction and occasionally a touch jumpy.Again however as was said for 'The Calm' these nitpicks are not massive and much of 'The Scar' works very well. It is a goodlooking film as well as being beautifully shot with atmospheric use of colour to match the mood it is gritty yet beautiful with many thoughtful and emotionally powerful images lingering long into the memory. Kieslowski's direction is quietly unobtrusive intelligently paced and never too heavy. Very intriguing use of sound and silence music is sparsely used but effectively intricate.It's a thoughtprovoking film too rarely rambling and makes what it has to say stick. Much of the story is sensitively told and poignant if not as much as Kieslowski's later work hardly cold. While deliberately paced it intrigues engaging a good deal while also suitably challenging the viewer in spots. The themes are explored well though there are thematically richer films from Kieslowski and the characters portrayed fairly bleakly but realistically carry the story well. As ever the complexity and nuances of the acting is to be admired.Overall interesting and very good early Kieslowski though he did go on to better things later. 810 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "After the failure that was the 3rd Halloween sequel the writers knew that was mainly due to the absence of Michael Myers. So what did they do? They invited Michael back in for the 4th sequel and back into the story of Halloween. Even though I did enjoy the 3rd sequel I do agree that I missed Michael. He's my favorite boogeyman so it'd be cool to see him return and do what he does best slice and dice and scare the heck out of me. Well is this really scary? Not too much but still it's a fun sequel to get into and watch in the dark. I like the story and how they are continuing into the Myer's past and how far Michael will go to destroy this blood line. Although I was disappointed to not have Laurie Strode in this one it was interesting to see how her legacy lives on with her daughter and now she will have the struggle with Michael Myers.Michael Myers has been in a coma for ten years when his massacre was stopped by Dr. Samuel J. Loomis and Laurie Strode. Myers is being transferred from Ridgemont Federal Sanitarium to Smith's Grove Sanitarium. He awakens when he hears that Laurie Strode his sister is deceased but her daughter Jamie Lloyd is alive and well in Haddonfield. He kills the ambulance crew and escapes. Dr. Loomis races to Haddonfield in an attempt to bring Myers' killing spree to an end once and for all. In Haddonfield his niece Jamie Lloyd has been adopted by the Carruthers family. She has frequent nightmares about Michael though she does not know who he is. On Halloween night Jamie goes out trickortreating dressed as a clown with her teenage foster sister Rachel. Her uncle Michael follows them. Meanwhile Loomis arrives in Haddonfield after an exhausting journey and contacts the police department to inform them of Myers' escape. He and Haddonfield's new Sheriff Ben Meeker begin to search the town for Michael and Jamie. Myers has also blacked out the town's electricity by throwing a technician onto a electrical box and singlehandedly annihilated the entire police force. The girls barricade themselves in the Sheriff's house while awaiting the arrival of the state police where Michael follows them and you'll have to see the movie to see the exciting conclusion.So over all Halloween 4 is a good sequel it's not the strongest in the series but it's one of the better stories of the franchise. I do like Jamie Lloyd she was an interesting addition to the story and the writers are making these movies very interesting. I'm glad they brought Dr. Loomis back in it brings us back into the original Halloween and he'll never give up until Michael Myers is gone for good which we know is not going to happen since we still have 4 more sequels after this one. But the 4th installment into the Halloween franchise is a good one so I do recommend that you see it if you get the chance.610".

I dunno if I ever cared about anyone in Friday the 13th.  But in the Halloweens 124and 5 they've always taken the time to get to know the main characters first and stick with them for at least one sequel.  Also in Halloween we had a staple character besides Myers  Donald Pleasence  who returned to battle Myers every time until his untimely death. I really liked the Jamie Lloyd character I mean getting decent actors in horror is difficult enough but getting a good child actor in horror?  Look at Child's Play!  We struck gold with Danielle her storyline and the rest of the new characters for Michael to stalk.  Oh yes and of course Donald Pleasence.      Alan Howarth parts with Carpenter and takes the score solo playing some fun twists to the main Halloween and the stalking theme giving Jamie a theme appropriately derivative of Laurie's theme and intermingling all the themes in various places for an original sound with music that's been with us for 2 movies now.Hopefully the viewer won't remember the end of Halloween 2 well enough to recall Laurie shooting Michael's eyes out and him stumbling around slicing blindly as blood ran down his maskwait this is horror everyone's accustomed to inconsistency with horror.  Nevermind.  Besides compared to the plot holes of Curse of Michael Myers and then H20 neglecting Halloween 4  5 who cares about that minor detail.  Despite the new look new characters new tweaks Halloween 4 can't escape the fact that it is a sequel slasher and so despite everything that's new that works . . . it's all the same.  That's where my problem with the film lay and that's why I can't rank this up there with some of my favorite horror films of all time.  It's a good Halloween sequel but there are better more original films within this series and especially in other series.  Oh well.".

I love the scene where Kelly Meeker brings the coffee to who she thinks is the deputy sitting in the rocking chair. SCARY stuff. That scene ALWAYS scares the crap out of me. This movie is loaded with suspense and it has an absolutely SHOCKING although unexplained ending. Just hearing Dr. Loomis saying no no nooo... then crying can spook you out! The truck scene towards the end is very scary and suspenseful as well. The scene where he bashes his head through the windshield still makes me jump.Also the heroines in this movie are almost as good as Laurie and her girlfriends in the first movie. Ellie Cornell is superb as Rachel I was very sorry to see her get killed off in the next movie and the relationship between her and her stepsister Jamie is wonderful.For a Halloween movie I'd definitely give it a 9 out of a 10!I always wondered and hoped that there really was a Haddonfield here in Illinois!".

Loomis now walks with the aid of a stick and has burns to his face and hands but is otherwise fine. Blimey! He's almost as indestructible as Myers himself! Halloween 4 racks up the jumps and gore but loses none of the thrills and excitement form the original movies.

Just like Friday the 13th Amityville Psycho Howling and Nightmare Halloween couldn't resist the fun. Second it was the 10 year anniversary of Halloween so they had to honor Myers by bringing him back again just like the 20th anniversary for H20. I guess will also see the 25th and 30th anniversary of Halloween with Myers escaping the nursing home on Halloween for these sequels. Finally they brought him back because of the utter disappointment of Halloween 3 which shouldn't have ever been made. But after these reasons it isn't that bad a sequel.

One of the reasons why this movie gets no good reviews is because of the story where Michael and Dr. Sam Loomis was burned. To put a rest to all of that I'll give you the scoop. Originally the beginning of this movie would have the burning hospital with Loomis coming out. The Fire department tries to put the fire out but Loomis would of said No! Let him burn!. Unfortunatlly it cost too much money to redo that scene so it was dropped thus hopefully ending all of the confusion.Now what was I saying? Oh yes now Michael is back. And as usual he isn't taking any prisoners. Now Laurie died in a car accident so her daughter Jaimie Probably an inside joke to Jaimie Lee Curtis has to be taken care of by another family. Meanwhile the mental instituion is about to take Michael away With an EXCELLENT cameo by Raymond O' Connor who makes alot of great quotes. Including one where you hear a mental guy screaming with the person picking Michael up saying Jesus! to which Raymond says Jesus ain't got nothing to do with this place.. In the ambulance Michael murders both the people picking him up and the driver. Nice death in which he drives his thumb through a guys mouth and rams it again the wall repeatedly.Now Dr. Loomis and Michael both meet up and alot of deaths later Micheal is once again gone for now...I don't see why this movie doesen't get good reviews the person in the Michael mask did an exceptional job here. As did the actors with another great performance by Donald Pleasence. Honestly I found this MUCH better than my original favorite sequel Halloween 2. While 5 6 7 and 8 were mediocore films this one comes out on top as the best of the sequels.Thumbs up recommendedRATING 12 out of ".

Dr. Loomis who also survived the explosion now scarred and crippled races to stop him.Halloween 4 is the best of all 8 films in my opinion cause the atmosphere and plot are the most original along with a superior script penned by Alan McElroy. Danielle Harris is amazing as Jaime and Ellie Cornell does a great job as Rachel. The real star of the film is Donald Pleascene reprising his role as Loomis. he is an amazing hero and a great character especially in the scene at the gas station where he confronts Myers he shows absolutely no fear whatsoever.

	schema:reviewBody "As such Halloween 4 The Return of Michael Myers 1988 isn't a bad film. However it suffers from the major problem that it has pretty much exactly the same story as parts 1 and 2 only that there's no Jamie Lee Curtis and a lot less suspense. After the third part Season of the Witch had no Michael Myers in it and flopped the producers decided to bring Michael back in. So this film is simply more of the exact same which kindly stated becomes slightly unoriginal after some time.After ten years in a high security prison for dangerous mental screwups Michael gets transferred to another prison and  Surprise!  he escapes killing all his guards on the way. He wastes no time and hurries to Haddonfield where the little daughter of his sister Laurie Strode is waiting to be terrorized by uncle Mike... Luckily good old Dr. Sam Loomis has seen it all coming and is also on his way to Haddonfield...As mentioned above The Return of Michael Myers has little new to offer. The majority of late 80s slashers were blatant imitations of Halloween and Friday the 13th but they usually made up in gore for what they lacked in originality. Since this film was intended for wider mainstream audiences however it isn't even really gory. Heck a large part of the murders in this one are not even seen as they take part offscreen and those that are seen are scandalously unbloody. The film does have some positive aspects though the most welcome being the return of the great Donald Pleasence in the role of Dr. Sam Loomis. Pleasence is great as always but that doesn't change that he does exactly the same things as in parts 1 and 2. Michael is still a menacing villain but then he does nothing that he didn't already do in a scarier manner in parts 1 and 2. Ellie Connel who plays the teenage victim protagonist isn't bad but she hardly is a replacement for Jamie Lee Curtis. One very welcome new face is then 10year old Danielle Harris who is very likable and cute in the role of little Jamie Lloyd a character it is easy to be scared for. Furthermore John Carpenter's brilliant original theme tune simply never gets old.The Return of Michael Myers isn't a terrible failure it isn't even really a bad film but it suffers from being nothing but a duller less suspenseful copy of its predecessors. John Carpenters original Halloween of 1978 is a classic and absolute mustsee of course and Halloween II of 1981 is incredibly suspenseful and doubtlessly also a mustsee for every Horror fan. All other sequels may be seen or skipped in my opinion. Halloween 4 The Return of Michael Myers maybe could have been more entertaining with more gore and brutality but sadly it is overall pretty dull.".

The fact that Friday The 13th was basically plagiarized and not very well at that from Halloween didn't save the Halloween franchise from falling victim to the same repetition curse. It's somewhat ironic and troubling that the one Halloween sequel that dared to be different from episodes two four and the other four dozen generally gets the harshest criticism.Halloween 4 picks up years after the end of Halloween II a film that decided to follow an atmospheric original with a clichd gorefest that is so devoid of impact it is a wonder the franchise has lasted at all. In a regurgitation of the anonymousrelative clich that proves Moustapha Akkad was watching The Empire Strikes Back just a little too closely we are told that Laurie Strode was killed in a car accident but not before she gave birth to Jamie who is played in this and the next episode by Danielle If I Only Had A Career Harris. Doctor Loomis is there naturally to give us his usual melodramatic spiel.According to something I just read the makers of Halloween 4 felt that the finished film was too soft and added some pickups to increase the gore factor. I must have blinked and missed these inserts because in comparison to Halloween parts two and five there is really very little to get carried away about here. Even the footage at the end of this episode is presented in a very tame fashion compared to when it appears in the next.A popular defence of Halloween 4 is that it at least has the titular Shatnermasked character in it. This however is a poor defense for formulaic dribble that brings nothing new to the genre. We keep hearing about how Michael escapes from this or that unnamed facility and how he drives the requisite overnight drive to Haddonfield are left to our imaginations. As in they show us absolutely nothing that gives us a clear idea of how Michael achieved these small goals. We're simply told Michael does these things and expected to take it as read. Still the things that we are being told aren't completely ludicrous as happens in later sequels.I gave Halloween 4 a one out of ten. There are far better serial killerbased films out there. This one is only worth investigating if you're really bored.".

LittleIn 1978 the world was introduced to psychopath Michael Myers who stalked the screens in the extremely successful Halloween which has come to be possibly the most influential horror movie of all time and the most successful independent film of all time. It was later followed by the decent Halloween II that didn't live up to the original but gave it a nice try. Michael Myers was put to rest for a little to allow the series to try for a new storyline in Halloween III Season of the Witch but that flopped at the box office and Hollywood decided to put the Halloween name to rest for a little. Then six years later Michael Myers was brought back to the screen in the awesome thriller Halloween 4 The Return of Michael Myers in which new characters were introduced old ones returned and tons of thrills awaited.The story isn't bad in Halloween 4 Michael awakes from a coma on October 30th 1988 nearly ten years to the day since he was put in it. He escapes from a hospital truck and heads back to Haddonfield looking for his sister Lori who does not appear in this but was played by Jamie Lee Curtis in the first and second Halloween films. Rather than finding Lori Michael finds her daughter Jamie played by the magnificent and amazing Danielle Harris who is living under the foster care of the Carruthers. Her older foster sister Rachel Ellie Cornell who almost does as good a job as Jamie Lee Curtis did in the original as the heroine is Jamie's real friend here. And once Michael returns home looking for Jamie he'll kill anyone who gets in his way including Rachel and some of Rachel's friends.Donald Pleasance returns as Dr. Sam Loomis and his performance of the character has not let up yet. He is equally as captivating and heroic as he was in the original Halloween only this time he is more determined to kill Michael. As Loomis tries to find his way to Haddonfield Michael's home town where Jamie is he is side tracked by explosions cruel kids the loss of a car and even a man who is searching to kill his own 'devil.' The true question becomes whether or not Loomis will be able to save Jamie and Rachel and survive Michael again. There are other characters here including a new Sheriff Rachel's cheating boyfriend the Sheriff's bad natured daughter and a whole bunch of town resident Red Necks that want revenge on Michael for what he did years ago.Sadly this great sequel would be a little let down by the story line of Halloween 5 The Revenge of Michael Myers and then even more destroyed in Halloween The Curse of Michael Myers. Then when Halloween H20 rolls around Halloween 4 Halloween 5 and Halloween The Curse of Michael Myers would be forgotten and acted as if they never happened. This is a wonderful entry to the Halloween series that isn't too gory and involves all the right elements that the original Halloween defined to be in a horror movie but this film is original about it. Not many horror films can say they almost lived up to the original Halloween but Halloween 4 The Return of Michael Myers can.810 Recommended for people looking for a thrill or a scare".

However while being transferred to a new institution Michael wakes up and begins a new killing spree this time targeting Jamie Lloyd Danielle Harris the niece of Laurie Strode.Yep seriously...that is the plot of this film easily illustrating the most glaring fault of this comeback effort the series was creatively exhausted after Halloween II so all the rest is just an excuse to make some money.Add to this the fact that the movie really isn't even scary. Whatsoever. Heck even the Friday the 13th series had 34 films that were decent. This one though does nothing to reestablish the character of Michael Myers and eventually descends into a combination of slasher which at times is laughable and suspense let's just say it ain't Hitchcock. Plus to add insult to injury the Myers mask isn't even the old Bill Shatner mold from the first two instead featuring a cheap knockoff that isn't nearly as spooky. The final nail is driven home with the most insipid cringeworthy ending of perhaps the entire series.About the only redeeming factor in this movie whatsoever is the performance of Harris as young Jamie. She really does an excellent job and deserves a lot of credit for creating the only human drama element in the movie at all.Thus though this film tried to resurrect quite literally the character of Michael Myers it eventually only serves to provide 90 minutes of blandness. I wasn't expecting greatness out of the third Halloween sequel but I wasn't expecting total boredom either and that is exactly what I received.".

	schema:reviewBody "This great sequel in my opinion is an improvement on its legendary original. It involves former characters great new characters good Midwest Halloween feel good suspense great action superb acting amazing writing and the wild card which is the involvement of the citizens of Haddonfield. After 10 years in the hospital recovering from the injuries he suffered in Halloween 2 Michael escapes while being transfered between hospitals and quickly starts off on the same foot he left off on. After trying to kill his sister Laurie Strode in Halloween 4 he goes after her daughter and his niece Jamie Lloyd. Rachel Corruthers played by Ellie Cornell is her step sister who protects her from Michael. Cornell gives one of the best acting performances I've ever seen. But the highlight of this great film is the performance gave my Donald Pleasance who reprises his role as Dr. Loomis Michael's former doctor. Loomis who is burnt and has a bad leg tracks Michael from the beginning of the film after hearing of how Michael's ambulance crashed.PLEASE buy this movie. If you don't like it you can personally complain to me at pacman000hotmail.com enjoy".

With her parents dead she is now the target of the unkillable monster. Helping her is the reliable Donald Pleasance as Dr. Loomis. I think this is the movie where Loomis's obsession with Myers starts showing throughit was only hinted at in the first two. It's too bad the future sequels did not follow in the direction as this movie. This could have moved the movies in a different direction. Halloween 5 was rather dull Halloween 6 was overly gory and the others are just forgettable. Still I love this movie a lot and will watch it every year on Halloween. I give this movie a 910.".

However a wellmeaning friend gives him information about a secret class in male selfesteem run by the harsh Dr. P Billy Bob Thornton. In class and on outings Dr. P uses tough tactics to turn his unfortunate students into successful men. But what happens when Dr. P decides to put the moves on Amanda after a chance meeting? Does Roger have what it takes to thwart Dr P's efforts and win Amanda for himself? This is a fairly nice but easily disposable film. Thornton is of course a natural choice for the scoundrel teacher and he delivers a goodandslimy performance. Barrett is beautiful and touching as the love interest adding greatly to the film's enjoyment. Heder although a good comic performer seems all wrong as a romantic lead. But perhaps it is a bit refreshing for someone without the knockout good looks to go for broke in the love department. Ben Stiller has a fine cameo as a wacko exstudent of Dr. P. The setting in NYC and the costumes are nice. All in all the film is a satisfying view for a rainy day.

Todd Luiso best known for the wimpy employee in High Fidelity is probably the only actor that manages to turn in something worthy of appreciation.

Thornton has a knack for creating these sinister characters but this one is a far cry from his Bad Santa. I give the film credit for having a nice romantic feel between Heder and Barrett. However you'll keep waiting for the big laughs that you expect from the filmmakers and they never come that's why this film disappointed me.";

It really was the same plot as Anger Management.The big difference between this and Anger Management is that Anger Management was much funnier with pairing Jack Nicolson with Adam Sandler funnier myself.It is basically the same plot but this movie is worth renting when it comes out on video for decent entertainment.".

Forget the fact that Billy Bob Thornton unsuccessfully reprises his Bad Santa character minus the excessive drinking and fng. Forget the fact that the film makes traumatic rape memories a running gag. The fact of the matter is that the film just isn't funny. Seriously how did it fail? How do you cast Billy Bob Thornton as a complete asshole and Jon Heder as a hapless loser  the parts that these two were born to play  and fail to make it hilarious? How does Thornton  Heder  Luis Guzman  David Cross  Michael Clarke Duncan  Ben Stiller add up to a film which is just so... NOT FUNNY? It simply doesn't make sense to my tired brain.I guess it could be because the script is so incoherent not even Kubrick could've made a decent movie out of it. It has very few funny jokes and it barely knows what it wants to be. Comedy or drama? Romance or thriller? A heartwarming intelligent comedy masterpiece or a lazy cashin on Thornton's popularity? Well I think you know the answer to that last one.The film's pacing is way off as the film rushes to its conclusion a plot twist even the kid from Bad Santa could've seen coming a mile away it feels like we've only watched half a movie. The lack of any real laughs an engaging plot the rehashed characters it all makes for an utterly unsatisfactory comedy which isn't worthy of Billy Bob Thornton.Much like this review School for Scoundrels is lame and a waste of time.

	schema:headline " Well written clever and funny...a battle of wits and love";
	schema:reviewBody "I give Jon Heder great respect for doing everything he can to continue his career following his type casted performance as the brutally stupid Napoleon Dynamite which became an instant cult classic. Having seen everything he has done since that film I think this is truly his first step at escaping that role. It's still a comedy and he's still the underdog but he's smart and cute funny and he gets to match wits and kick ass against Billy Bob Thorton which highlights this film and makes it worthwhile. It's really an underdog film and it's about being yourself. The laughs aren't really roll on the floor but more of a subtle dark humor with so much of it basing itself around the battle between these two men...the self confident conceited vindictive Dr. P and the much more down to earth and reluctantly confident romantic and determined Roger. It's actually a very clever and intelligent and for the most part originally done comedy.Jon Heder of course heads up the cast as Roger. One of the truly delightful things about Heder's performance in this film is that he is so just a buddy. He's a normal regular guy with some real confidence problems and you can't help but relate to the guy. He looks and acts so down to earth and that might be Heder's real charm in breaking out into other roles besides Napoleon which I never thought was all that spectacular. He is really good in this part and you'll root for him 100. His teachermentor and then ultimate adversary is the deliciously bad Billy Bob Thorton as the mysterious Dr. P. I mean overall Thorton's character is just a complete and utter Ahole...and I never ever swear in my reviews but that is exactly what he is. Dr. P is mean and ignorant but yet somehow manages to inspire nonconfident men into being mean machines themselves and taking what they want. Thorton is just awesome in this role. You hate the guy and yet find yourself drawn to his weird style. Finally he takes a rather psychotic turn and goes after Heder's girl that Heder absolutely loves launching a complete war between the men with no holds barred. Both of them play a mean game and in the process Heder really shines with his tactics considering how twisted Thorton's character is. But the comedy in the film definitely peaks with their battle. Both actors are terrific!! Jacinda Barrett plays the object of both their affections and despite a small more subtle role she does quite well and manages to have good chemistry with both Thorton and Heder but especially Heder. And she's not classically outright beautiful but has a more girl next door to her look which helps with the part and the story. Michael Clarke Duncan is hilarious as the equally cruel teacher's assistant Lesher. Duncan's comedy comes entirely from him being so enormous and physical at the same time but his role is classic. Also honorable mention to the supporting cast of comedians including the under rated Horatio Sanz Matt Walsh and Todd Louiso. Most useless role in a film gets handed out without hesitation to Ben Stiller who makes a useless cameo that is probably supposed to spike people's interest but he is forced on you in true Stiller fashion. Stiller's comedy doesn't fit this type of film because it isn't a laugh out loud stupid comedy but far more intelligent and he just doesn't fit. I suppose he likely had a hand in producing or something so he had to make himself a role but he wasn't necessary but graciously the part is small. The director is also a Frat Pack director so it makes sense he brought Stiller aboard.However that's not to say anything bad about director and cowriter Todd Phillips because he does an excellent job. I think his direction style is subtle and he lets talented actors do their thing like Heder and Thorton. He has done a lot of comedy but it has mostly been more the gross out Porky's type humor and this is a nice change for him and I think he should hopefully do some much more intelligent comedy like this one. School for Scoundrels is definitely one of the better comedies I have seen as of recently. Some won't like it because it's far more subtle and intelligent but that is it's charm and adults will like it's style of comedy. I do recommend absolutely!! 810".

Then arrives Madame Therbouche a flirtatious painter from the Prussian metropolis Berlin and convinces Diderot to pose for her more daring then his idol fellowphilosopher Voltaire in Berlin in the nude leading to an animated row with his wife Antoinette still naked except for a very unsteady sheet all over the estate's park. Worse the saucy scene is witnessed by a feared visitor Holbach's brother the Cardinal who is hunting for the illegal Encyclopaedia printers to divert him the baroness confesses her real and imagined sins since years and next sends in every female to do the same later joined spontaneously by ...";

There is wicked and mischievous goingson in and around a beautiful home on the road between Paris and Avignon. This is where Denis Diderot Vincent Perez is compiling and printing his banned multivolume encyclopaedia. My goodness! I had no idea that a 17th Century philosopher could have so much fun putting into print some of his thoughts and experiences.  If it's natural he says It must be good for you.  He not only says it but practises it and no woman seems safe from his ardent approaches.Amongst all the farcical nonsense there is some heavy satire on the church's attitude to sex. exotic foods such as chocolate and caviare musical scores the pig organ is a delight and banned literature.  Vincent Perez as Diderot plays the character superbly  wearing a delightful smile though not much else when he poses for his portrait by the beautiful Madame Therbouche a socalled painter from Berlin though actually a spy arranged by the Cardinal.  Her mission is to locate the clandestine printing presses.There is plenty of action in the film and never a dull moment as Diderot prances naked around the surrounding gardens much to the disgust of the Cardinal.  Much of the action is around the Cardinal who must be prevented from finding the printing presses.  This is easily arranged by recruiting as many ladies as possible to seek confession of their sins before the Cardinal.  Besides attending to his clerical duties he seems not uninterested in their wickedness.Finally Diderot falls in love with Madame Therbouche as he seeks her assistance in the preparation of Volume X111. She agrees of course and why not?  The last volume is to be all about sensuality a subject in which both of them are so well versed.An absolute delight!".

	schema:headline " Comedy of manners without the manners";
	schema:reviewBody "Depending on your taste this French movie could be considered either as a raunchy French comedy with arty pretensions or as Gallicflavored MerchantIvory type fare with a refreshing lack of them. The story involves reallife 18th century French philosoph Denis Diderot who is holed up with a bunch of his equally jaded family and friends on the luxurious estate of his friend Baron D'Holbach where he is working on a scandalous encyclopedia propounding his libertine philosophy. When D'Holbach's brother Michael Serrault a prominent cardinal shows up unexpectedly D'Holbach's wife Josiane Basko and Diderot's other various friends try to distract the clergyman from what is really going on at the estate.This is set in the same era as Dangerous Liasons and also the era of the Marquis de Sade but for better or worse it is much less serious than the various films based on that literary work. It isn't quite the unbridled sex romp you'd expect for a French film set in this free and loose era. Most of the ribaldry involves Diderot under the somewhat reproachful gaze of his wife posing nude for an attractive female painter Fanny Arnadt. There is some casual adultery mostly involving a promiscuous female party guest Arielle Dombasle. The sexiest scenes though are undoubtedly the ones where Diderot's daughter Vahina Giocante and D'Holbach's daughter a preAmelie Audrey Tatou take a hot tub soak together or the scene where Diderot's relatively prudish wife Francoise Lepine receives a happy ending from a studly African masseuse. But this movie is much more raunchy comedy than sex. It's kind of comedy of manners but with no manners.Vincent Perez is quite good as Diderot as is Josiane Balasko as the Madame D'Holbach and Michael Serrault as the cardinal. Francoise Lepine is also pretty good even though she largely disappeared after this movie. And Fanny Arnadt is ALWAYS worth watching. Tatou and Gicante meanwhile have little to do but peel off for their hot tub scene but actually that is PLENTY. This movie is pretty lightweight but it's also a pretty fun watch.".

If you see only nudity and scabrous jokes here I am afraid that this film is not about it at all. You may try but you can not persuade me. What I see here  is a great philosopher and great struggle for enlightenment. And what I admire in French style is to do serious things with easy smile and turning all into a fest. And they do it very powerful and in very fascinating manner. Vincent Perez and Fanny Ardant are splendid and subtle. They show a relation between two adult persons. Look how really adult people do it not kidult. Great part of the movie is devoted to question of religion. Soundtrack to the movie is worthy of listening. Main song performed by Boy George adds richness to atmosphere.You feel courage behind the fest  you can see behind the form its content. You see a great selfcontrol behind this smile. They do not try to make a good face playing bad they do not play fool no. On the contrary they make their fest so courageously they are able to play games when the matter is quite serious so you see Frenchmen are great nation. As if they know a great secret of life... To smile like in an old song...Smile Smile though your heart is aching Smile even though it's breaking When there are clouds in the sky you'll get by If you smile through your fear and sorrow Smile and maybe tomorrow You'll see the sun come shining through for youLight up your face with gladness Hide every trace of sadness Although a tear may be ever so near That's the time you must keep on trying Smile what's the use of crying You'll find that life is still worthwhile If you'll just SmileThis is a film which Fenchmen made after all what happened with them after the Age of Enlightenment having in mind all what they did not find necessarily to say straightly. I see that this film has a strongest content covered with jokes. Only Frenchmen are able to say something complex using such easy manner without harm to the content.I love this movie from the very beginning to the very end.".

	schema:reviewBody "In France a group of free thinkers led by the philosopher and writer Denis Diderot have been working to produce the first ever encyclopedia and bring enlightenment and knowledge to their fellow Frenchmen. With the authorities placing an order to stop the spread of this evil work Diderot is forced to hide the printing presses underground at his mansion as he tries to finish his work. It is a wonder though that he can write at all as his freedom brings him a spread of women wanting 'liberation'. He is fine with promoting this way of thinking until his own daughter starts to explore her sexuality with feelings towards an older man. A visit by the Cardinal causes some delay but Baroness d'Holbach tries to keep him busy throughout his visit while the work continues to get the book out.Without any knowledge of this film I sat to watch it and immediately realized that this was a typically bawdry French comedy that does what that description suggests by being colourful full of raucous dialogue sexual innuendo and nudity. Unfortunately this takes what could have been an interesting historical film with a comic tone and makes it a sort of unfunny Carry On film full of gratuitous nudity unfunny comedy and dramacharacters that totally fail to keep the audience involved in these comic japes that really lack heart. The story is so spoilt by crude excess that it is never interesting or involving and gradually turns into a very boring series of sexual japes. There is a serious side in there somewhere but it is badly treated and badly handled and it just doesn't work when placed in the middle of so much crude innuendo. If it were funny then it would be at least a bit better but it isn't funny and it doesn't have the 'Gallic sexual energy' that it clearly wants to have. The cast all gallop around with the necessary amount of bawdry behaviour and 'huhhuhhuh' French energy but none of them can do more than just mess around in the same manner as Sid James and Barbara Windsor were doing decades ago. Perez is nice to look at but without a character he does just play the sort of lead character in Carry On movies  attempts to deal with issues around his daughter are poor since the film is more interested in getting her naked in a bath than anything else. Of course there will be those who find the sight of Audrey Tautou and Vahina Giocante naked in a bath of milk to be a pleasing one but a bit more actual acting would have been nice too. Balasko is the worst example of Carry On hamming and her whole performance was poor. Ardant was interesting as she was more serious but her nice touches are lost in the material. Overall the whole cast is poor although I don't blame them so much as the misjudged tone of crude humour running throughout the whole film.Overall this is a poor film that will only appeal to those who like their French films to just be a load of sexual innuendo and clich bawdry behaviour in period clothes. Historical interests and conflicts within the characters are all there but lost below a load of nudity and Carry On style japes. Sid James must be looking down from smut heaven with pleasure but for me I would have liked a bit more structure drama or laughs even one of the three would have done. But maybe I'm just missing the point of this film.".

	onyx:emotionText "In France a group of free thinkers led by the philosopher and writer Denis Diderot have been working to produce the first ever encyclopedia and bring enlightenment and knowledge to their fellow Frenchmen. With the authorities placing an order to stop the spread of this evil work Diderot is forced to hide the printing presses underground at his mansion as he tries to finish his work. It is a wonder though that he can write at all as his freedom brings him a spread of women wanting 'liberation'. He is fine with promoting this way of thinking until his own daughter starts to explore her sexuality with feelings towards an older man.

It was about a man named Denis Diderot Vincent Perez who was the creator of the encyclopedia. His wife Madame Diderot Francoise Lepine and his daughter Angelique Diderot Vahina Giocante. And Audrey Tautou starred as Julie d'Holbach. This movie was filled with extremely funny moments the funniest ones were the Pig Organ they were pulled by their tails to create a melody. I was impressed with that. Next was when Diderot got a boner when seeing Madame Therbouche Fanny Ardant while she was painting a portrait of him naked.  Growing start of steadfastness. A cute scene with Baronne d'Holbach Josiane Balasko walking her pet pig on a leash and it was dressed up. And lastly an Adam and Eve scene with Mr Diderot chasing his wife around the garden naked with the Baroness and Le cardinal Michel Sarrault the very dramatic one watching.And then the Cardinal sniffed table salts and the Baroness says I feel queasy! I need fresh air! HA!HA!HA!There was a terrible scene with the Baroness's pig cooked up as a lunch and she replaced her pig a canary. SHAME! There were also some LOVELY things to see in this film like the Turkish baths and messages. Beautiful. And the party thrown for the Cardinal with dance music fire works and wine. Quite something. And at the end Diderot FELL IN LOVE WITH MADAME THERBOUCHE!!! Uhoh!It's lovely to see hear and have conversations in French. Fun movie! With dance music!".

But it was worth it. It is fun satire on morals and religion that reminded me a bit of the even more wonderful SIRENS. Given the subject matter and frequent fullfrontal nudity both male and female it is no wonder it has had little or no exposure no pun intended here in the puritanical USA. I have to admit I was mostly interested in this film because of Audrey Tautou. Her screen time is very short but for about half that time she is nude...and a glorious sight it is too. But I'm glad it turned out to have so much more going for it. Highly recommended... if you can understand French or have the ability to make your own subtitles.".

Otter was the quintessential smooth talker always working an angle on everybody especially the ladies. When a woman tells him that his lovemaking wasn't that great he cocks his head points a finger at himself and mouths the words not great? in mock disbelief. Before Tom Hanks got Big he made a career out of playing this character. Also John Vernon set a standard for straight men with his portrayal of the beleaguered Dean Wormer plagued by his zoo fraternity.Not all of the movie's humor aims low by any means some of it is quite sophisticated.

	schema:reviewBody "John Landis's directorial debut and John Belushi's first starring role make this screwball comedy about college life in the early 60's a mustsee.  I saw this picture for the first time when it was released to theaters and laughed my buns off it still holds up today almost 30 years later.Every actor in the show gives a bravura performance with standout debuts by the likes of Thomas Hulce Tim Matheson Karen Allen Bruce Davidson and others.  In addition there's a sense throughout the picture that we all knew these guys at one time or another in our lives.  Shoot I think I may have BEEN one or two of these guys at some point in my life.  Of course the picture revolves around Belushi's terrifically overthetop Bluto Blutarsky but you simply can't ignore characters like Boone Otter Niedermeyer Gregg Marmalade and my personal favorite DDay.The writing on this picture is really far better than the looselystructured plot first indicates.  Each character is introduced neatly at their entrance and by extension the other characters are set up by the entrances of their surrounding characters.  For instance when we first meet Belushi's character he's holding a schooner of beer in one hand and drunkenly taking a leak on the Delta Tau Chi lawn.  Right away we know what the rest of these guys are going to be like.  Then when DDay makes his entrance driving his hawg through the front door and up the stairs to play the William Tell Overture on his throat before pulling a beer out of his jacket and popping the top our fears are confirmed.  Meanwhile we get to meet the uptight repressed and mildly facsist other frat through similar vignettes.  Kevin Bacon is particularly hilarious in his initiation Thank you sir! May I have another?.John Landis made his debut with this picture and what a debut it was! His camera follows each of the characters and events at near breakneck speed giving the audience little time to recover from one laugh before getting slapped in the head with another.  Lots of natural lighting and sharp steady pacing with smooth transitions keep the story moving. Refreshingly the film doesn't rely on overthetop special effects to hold our attention. Then again is there really any place for SFX in a picture like this?The whole picture is one long laugh from beginning to end.  If you're a college grad you'll forget what it was really like to have to work hard study and generally bust your tail to graduate.  If you haven't yet gone to college this picture will give you all the wrong ideas.  On the other hand you've gotta see this one if for no other reason than to learn all the right and wrong things to do at a college party.".

It is the grossout boysonly flick that launched a new wave of ruden'crude teen comedies as well as immortalizing John Belushi as one of America's most beloved comedic icons.It's the 1960s and the Delta fraternity is in trouble with the Faber College's Dean Wormer John Vernon yet again. The frat's crazy antics have gotten out of hand and the grades of its students have been steadily declining. Grabbing at the opportunity Dean Wormer uses their poor grades and behavior as an excuse to kick them off the campus. However the Deltas fight back  and give it all they've got.Animal House is solely responsible for the surge of teenstyled comedies in the 1980s and '90s. There is no other film predating this to speak of which mixed sex profanity vulgarity slapstick and rebellion all into one funny little bundle. Animal House truly is a revolutionary comedy for better or worse. Yet in fact for all its offensive material Animal House is joyously likable infectious and agreeable. The writers  Harold Ramis Douglas Kenney and Chris Miller  create a plethora of strong characters which helps define and separate Animal House from many of its imitators and indeed compares it to the equallyenjoyable American Pie series which  like the Animal before it  took the time to study and care for its characters rather than completely exploit them for humor  it's always harder to laugh at characters we don't care about and much easier to laugh at those of whom we do.Director John Landis who would reteam with Belushi again in 1980 with The Blues Brothers not only understands his cast mainly Belushi but also his audience and paves a way for sibling genre entries through his realistic slapstick approach this is not crazy in the same way as Airplane Naked Gun or Police Academy is  in fact it's far more rooted in realism and only a few sequences really get out of hand and turn into classic dumb slapstick.John Belushi as the alcoholic Bluto Blutarsky on getting kicked out of college Seven years down the drain! I might as well join the Peace Corps! remains the scenestealer to this day yet despite the film's close links with Belushi in general he is just a costar and when onscreen rarely speaks a fact played to the film's comedic advantage  when Bluto gives his final rousing speech it seems to mean something even ifwellit doesn't. Belushi demanded the largest paycheck of all the actors  including Donald Sutherland  but is hardly the star of Animal House. Had he been it may very well not have been as successful as it turned out to be  not because Bluto is annoying but because introducing him in smaller portions  rather than focusing on him alone  constructs a fallback mechanism of sorts when the comedy is lagging too much they bring in Bluto for support.Bluto thrives on fun and partying  when he learns of a possible toga party he begins a chant. One imagines he's so drunk and stoned he doesn't really understand much of what is going on. The film never identifies with him on a personal level. He's just sort of there. And we get the feeling perhaps he's only involved in the frat's antics because it's a blast  does he really care about staying in college? Or does he just want more free booze? Animal House might not be the best comedy of all time and I'm hardly going to start arguing that it is. For one thing it can tend to be a bit inconsistent  the humor is never continuously strong rather it comes in bursts. Technically it's imperfect  by a long shot. However whoever said that the amount of laughter alone defines the greatness of a comedy? Do we need it to be fine art? Animal House doesn't only have its fair share of funny material and iconic screen moments but is also incredibly entertaining rowdy and cool  the quintessential college film and certainly the sort of comedy any selfrespecting bachelor would make sure he views at least two hundred times a year. Give or take. All together now Toga toga toga!".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie on TV last night and was blown away by how relentlessly terrible it was both in execution and content. It was interesting only as a reference point to the sensibilities of an earlier age. Since Animal House was apparently considered in 1978 to be the height of wit and daring and since today in comparison with what might be called its pop culture progeny it appears either embarrassingly tame or lame we can tell just how much the popular culture has evolved in the intervening time. There has been a sea change in received notions of what is cool since 1978 probably comparable to the change in such perceptions during the similar length of time between 1951 and 1978. In other words its overtly antiestablishment themes and primitive ideas of transgressive humor make Animal House very much a product of its time. This movie can really only be appreciated as a poorlyacted and amateurishlydirected glimpse into the mindset of youngish Americans of another age. I know I'm ragging on this movie but the humor in Animal House just doesn't translate into today's world and on balance that is probably something for which we should be grateful.".

Since Animal House was apparently considered in 1978 to be the height of wit and daring and since today in comparison with what might be called its pop culture progeny it appears either embarrassingly tame or lame we can tell just how much the popular culture has evolved in the intervening time. There has been a sea change in received notions of what is cool since 1978 probably comparable to the change in such perceptions during the similar length of time between 1951 and 1978. In other words its overtly antiestablishment themes and primitive ideas of transgressive humor make Animal House very much a product of its time. This movie can really only be appreciated as a poorlyacted and amateurishlydirected glimpse into the mindset of youngish Americans of another age. I know I'm ragging on this movie but the humor in Animal House just doesn't translate into today's world and on balance that is probably something for which we should be grateful.";

To be a wet blanket about it and to use words that would definitely get me pantsed and hung upsidedown in the dean's office National Lampoon's comedy fits into the same niche that Saturday Night Live has occupied since the '70s of being extremely white male and heteronormative while also being impishly antiauthority.

While in college in the early years of the millennium I knew dilapidated houses like that and dilapidated people like that. The familiarity makes some of Animal House funny especially when the Delta House protagonists are as much the subjects of mockery as are their opponents. The figure that most often cuts both ways is Bluto played by the movie's funniest actor in John Belushi. He's a retrograde caveman and while he's capable of being almost heroic in the limited milieu of a frat in any other context he'd qualify as a braindead sociopath. That's what makes the final shot of the movie which reveals his postcollege fate so cuttingly funny. Animal House is sufficiently wellmade and has enough laughs to get it into the comedic canon despite its mainstream brand of political incorrectness and a lot of slow and obvious scenes.".

My first tweet was 12 minutes in. Not laughed once yet. Should I have? I mention laughing  I mean internal laughter too. I hadn't identified a joke or a comedy situation by that point. Of course I then identified that certain other things had been referencing this film  most notably an episode of Futurama called robot house when Bender enrolls in Mars University. One of the robots spends the whole time in a little beanie hat which now becomes funnier as I have now seen the reference material I laughed a lot after first seeing One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest as it made the Simpsons so much funnier. Next tweet after the Futurama reference was 36 minutes I sort of smirked. I have no idea what I smirked at. Following this  This film is so bad I've stopped forward winding the advertsI suspect this was the first film to dare to show pretty girls with their tops off. However  the accessibility of boobs is now so easy my standards are considerably higher. My tweet that the topless pillow fight would have been better if they weren't all wearing MASSIVE granny pants made me realize that this is something that would have been cutting edge in 1978. I went a little controversial on my next one. Belushi. Only remembered as good because he died early? With him on the guitar smashing at parties though. Everyone who has ever been jealous of the smarmy bloke who plays the guitar and has the girls cooing on his every note has wanted to do that. Otherwise he is playing quite the most charmless and one dimensional character I've ever seen in cinema. Deeply unpleasant and unlikable. Anyone whose party trick is crushing a can on his own forehead gets no sympathy from me.I found myself entirely sympathizing with the group of new kids  who have somehow made it to college later I discover this is the only reason they aren't being drafted to fight in the Vietnam war which I can sympathize with but if going to college is the only way you are going to avoid getting killed in a ludicrous conflict then surely you'd do all you can to stay there they are searching for acceptance friendship and like minded people. Unfortunately for them they apparently only have two choices  the posh rich and intelligent kids or the complete brain dead losers. There was apparently no third choice. The posh kids wouldn't have them and the losers couldn't care less so the join Delta House who are already on double secret probation what the hell is that  how are you supposed to know you are in trouble if you aren't told about it? After various illegal activities underage drinking underage sex hints at date rape we believe his conscience got the better of him horse murder in addition to academic issues such as NOT GOING TO ANY CLASSES or having grade point averages of less than zero they seem somewhat surprised and shocked when they are expelled.I did identify a few attempts at humor in the process  The inability to open a bra strap has now become such a clich  and I know it wasn't a new joke when this film used it  that it is purely not funny.  The moment when Belushi's character puts pencils up his nose while in the Dean's office might have been funny if he'd removed them on replacement of the Dean's glasses  although maybe the fact that I was expecting that to happen makes it funnier although not that much funnier.  Sex with 13 year old girls isn't funny either.  Blatant racism in having a bunch of white kids walk into a bar full of black people and immediately get threatened with flickknives  is that funny because my preconceptions are that this really isn't realistic behavior? The closest thing for me to an actual comedy moment was when the house was being emptied and a cow was led down the front steps.In protest at their expulsion our anti?heroes decide to get their revenge ruining the homecoming parade an event that the good people of the town were very much enjoying they assault molest and pretty much attempted murder their way to notoriety finishing off with driving their death wagon or some such into the platform holding the Dean and his wife. How am I supposed to have any sympathy for people who have no idea that they are in control of their own destinies that they are guilty of all the charges against them and completely deserved everything that happened to them? If there was any sense of injustice against Delta House it might have been a different matter but these idiots did themselves no favors at all.31 years have not been kind to Animal House. I grew up with Alison Hannigan doing things with her flute in American pie. With Terrence and Philip singing about inappropriate relationships with their uncles in South Park the Movie.

Bravo rated this as the funniest movie of all time. But if you've never seen it be forewarned Bravo must have some underlying motives. You have to go into the movie determined to laugh at anything and struggle to laugh. You have to be a great actor to laugh at this movie or so drunk or stoned you'll laugh at anything. It looks like something that never had a script and was made by some teenagers who thought something sounded cool and funny but never envisioned it. Belushi tries and his talent is completely wasted here. Proof that a good comic isn't always a great judge of material.".

These problems still are in today's movies but this was a successful movie while those with similarly poor acting and cheesy portrayals of college life languish with straighttoDVD releases and are considered poor by all.This may have started the sexcomedies of today but as I said earlier time has not treated it well as almost every comedy with this sort of premise really requires knowledge of the time it is set in which I did not have. Admittedly though that may of helped me find some scenes funny the acting in this film made lines that should of worked not work and the movie almost screams for a laugh track as it would be appropriate given the wooden dialogue and sitcomlike overacting and premises.Time has moved on and good comedies of today are in a far superior league not just because of the acting shown but because they either choose to embrace the cheesiness or wackiness of their story and do things that people in the 70's wouldn't imagine seeing at M and R16 comedies which Animal House tries to do but fails as the wacky disturbing stuff was done far more tastefully.Other comedies focus on realism and are funny because you can imagine yourself in a situation not too far away from the one the characters find themselves in and the jokes they make are a lot like the ones you and your friends make.In short Animal House may have been revolutionary in the 70's but an audience watching it today would expect far more from a movie so highly acclaimed.

I mean despite his role being essentially a supporting one that was created mainly to provide the most outrageously hilarious moments he's the deservedly topbilled one that was the reason Animal House was such a big hit and continues to attract viewers today. This is certainly not to take away the contributions of such players as Tim Matheson Peter Riegert Bruce McGill John Vernon Mark Metcalf Stephen Furst and a young unknown named Kevin Bacon. But face it for the most part Belushi is the show. What probably also helped were such fetching females like Karen Allen and Sarah Holcomb who along with Mary Louise Weller and Lisa Baur provide the ample nudity that I'm sure provided some wet dreams for adolescent boys everywhere. Like me! Script by Harold Ramis Chris Miller and Douglas Kenney is funny from beginning to end and director John Landis adds some great improvisation of his own to the proceedings. So what more can I say except Toga! Toga! or Food fight! or my favorite line Was it over when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor? Hell no! among others...P.S. As a native Chicagoan I'm proud that Belushi Landis and Ramis also came from there. And yes the slide after the credits that says When in Hollywood Visit Universal Studios Ask for Babs! was retained for the HD DVD but the tours in neither Tinseltown nor Orlando honor the discount or free pass that saying her name originally entailed.".

He accepts diversity and from watching him tolerates no bigotry at all. That's the message I appreciated so much in watching top dog although the vehicle used could have been better executed. In a world where diversity should be the rule of the day and learning from our past a virtue Mister Norris like a lot of us sees the need to remind people of our past and what we should strive for in the future. It's one of the reasons I regularly watched Walker to see the triumph of good over evil. More films like this with a strong message are needed.

The movie that officially knocked Chuck off of his throne he was already beginning to show cracks with Hellbound The Hitman and a couple others but this is the one that did him in. Chuck should have known better to go the James Belushi route here. I dig Chuck for what he is but he doesn't have the funny personality to pull this off. The movie looks and feels extremely cheap even though it somehow managed to get a theatrical release. There isn't a whole lot of action to speak of other than a few explosions here and there and a rather lame shootout  chase scene at the end. It also has all the antics you would expect from this movie. The dog steals the show from under Chuck Norris even though he's a rather unlikable little thing. The villains have no character to speak of and are just there so Chuck has someone to overcome. I love action movies but this just reeked of laziness. Chuck Norris was always a bit of a risk when it came to his movies but at least he made a few good ones. It feels like he's not even trying here. He puts on a phony tough guy act that I didn't buy for a minute and effectively put the final nail in the coffin of his career. Final Thoughts if you wanna see Chuck succumb his standards to James Belushi's K9 series then be my guest. Be prepared to wallow in misery for most of the duration though. It's pretty awful stuff. This killed Norris's action movie career. He does some DTV films once in a while and most recently had a glorified cameo in The Expendables II210".

	schema:reviewBody "Beware of Top Dog. This movie is ruff. Directed by Aaron Norris and starring his brother martial artist and internet meme badass Chuck Norris. The movie tells a cop Jake Wilder Chuck Norris whom is force to partner with a police dog Reno when the dog's handler was killed by domestic terrorists. Now Jake and Reno must stop the domestic terrorists from attacking a conference on unity that the Pope is attending. Can they stop them or will the terrorists win out in the end? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie too much I have to say this movie is very unoriginal. It is way too similar to other buddy cop dog films in the past like 1989's K9 and Turner  Hooch. The movie pretty much used every cop clichs in the book as well just really badly. First off you got the two main characters that the film pretty much want the audience to believe are the odd couple. Still surprising they act way too similar to each other. In terms of personality they tend to follow the same pattern which is both being unpredictable loose cannon that often break the laws that they are trying to enforce who often anger their superior officer Ken Callahan Clyde Kusatsu. Honestly the movie would have work better if one of them were the straightlaced stickler for protocol the other was the cowboy cop but no the movie doesn't do that. First off you got a dog that doesn't even look like a police cop at all. He looks way too cute to a tough believable train police animal. He looks like he's in the wrong movie. Shouldn't he be herding sheep in some odd Warner Bros cartoon? One of the biggest problems with Reno is how quiet the dog is! Since he's so inaudible the movie felt that the dog scenes needed a little more sound. So they redub Reno with a human being. The person doing sound effects for the dog was terrible at hisher job. Its sounds more like them masturbating oddly than anything else. I also didn't like the home alone like booty traps that the dog set up for the bad guys. It really conflict with the rest of the film. Honestly I don't know who is this movie is made for! It looks like a kid's movie but the movie does go a little over the top with the violent with people getting shot in the head and car explosions. Many people dying in a bombing at an apartment complex doesn't mixed well with goofy slapstick humor of the rest of the film. Also the movie has way too racism overtones to be a kid's film. Antisemitic rants doesn't match up with the rest of the corny childish animal humor. I really hate the whole dog fair montage scene. It's pretty much filler since it doesn't advance the story. Very pointless. It's like they added that scene because they forgot that they were trying to make a movie that parents would bring their kids to. It seem so out of place. Surprising unlike the other film versions that has the dog do messy things the dog isn't the slob here. It's Chuck Norris's character. It's really hard to believe that Chuck Norris's character would be this lazy and still be able to kick ass with Chun Kuk Do. If this was real life he would have a really hard time do roundhouse kicks due to him being overweight. The movie does have alright fighting scenes but the slow motion stunts make it a bit implausible. The fight with the clowns was somewhat entertaining but as much as I love Chuck Norris as an action star I really don't know if the action film's audience would find this interesting. The movie also have the illtiming habit of being release a few days after the 1995's Oklahoma City Bombing. This pretty much kill the movie since the movie had a domestic whitesupremacist terrorist bombing plot going for it. Overall This roundhouse movie lost its kick. This movie has no bite to its bark. It's pretty much didn't live up to the woof. I don't recommended watching. I guess I just dogtired of films like this.".

I was also taken back by the horrifying true to life depiction of racist factions in the United States. I shook in horror as the racist leader shot a manikin depicting an ethnic person yelling That is a miss! This is a hit! I saw many striking parts of the plot like the NeoNazi attempt to blow up a building on Hitler's birthday. Through pure genius Norris discovers their intent and foils their plans.

Chuck Norris is even worse as he is supposedly a rough and tumble cop complete with a messy bachelor pad. Once again Norris isn't funny and neither is the dog. Although Top Dog did have 1995's most awkward moment of the year. That is when the dog attacks the pope and nearly kills the man add in the factor that people are killed and people yell racial slurs at regular intervals. Of course racism blood thirsty violence and physical attacks on religious figures makes for great entertainment for the little tykes. After all we seem to embrace the children who go ape and starts shooting up their schools...So why not market a movie at a younger age so little tykes can wipe out the popular kids at a younger age. It's a genius plan after all how cool would it be to return to your ten year reunion knowing that eight of the popular kids won't be attending due to your 4th grade shooting spree.

Watch as he simply pummels these bad guys which takes almost an hour in something that turns out like a live action loony toons outing. However before the pummelling begins these sour face bad guys simply like to rant about white power and stand around looking mean while constantly nodding at each other. Norris is one busy copper. An arrogant sloppy and gungho one too. Let's not forget a mummy's boy. His leadup work in trying to figure out what's going on is rather hilarious because everything feels like its made up on the spot hoping the clues would pop up than researching it. Then again if that happened we wouldn't get the heartstopping climax of tension laughs and someone riding a bike as fast as they can. The cast are all game with Michele Lamar Richards Clyde Kusatsu Timothy Bottoms Francesco Quinn and John Kerry. Norris phones it in while it's Reno who steals the show. There's even time midway through for Reno to take a break from the investigation to go to a dog show and mess about?!

If it had been a live performance there would have been those crushing dead silences every time the actors paused to allow reactions to their jokes.The next night at a party I was trying describe just how bad the movie really was.  This involved in part telling several of the jokes. Surprisingly my listeners laughed at them.  I could flatter myself and claim that I'm such a hot comic that I could get laughs even reading the obituaries out loud.  But that ain't so.  Let's just say that I gave the jokes a mildly competent delivery... and that's what Galaxina didn't do.Now a work of genius is indefinable.  No matter how much you analyze it you can never quite pin down why it is so exceptional while another film  with all the same objective attributes  is merely competent.  The same is true of transcendent badness.  The world is full of bad movies with the same objective failures in budget acting writing and directing.  But Galaxina is loaded with subtle catastrophes.  There are nuances that extract the worst possible effect from so many scenes.  And I can't quite figure out how it was done.

	schema:reviewBody "I got this movie when I saw it for 5 at this booth where this guy was selling a lot of old DVDs from WalMart's defunct DVD rental service. I knew nothing about it but saw the title that it was the only film role for Playboy Playmate of the Year Dorothy Stratten and that it was put out by Rhino so I hauled off and bought it.It begins with a ripoff of the Star Wars crawl which they obviously thought needed to be three long paragraphs in order to be a true parody because it goes on forever without having much to say. What it does is tell you that this ship is traveling along with Galaxina who is this robot shaped like a Playboy Playmate who manages this ship. Then there is a LONG shot of the expanse of the ship also like Star Wars and the credits go on. The credits go on forever in fact pausing every now and then to show Galaxina in her glowly chair a great image but one we end up seeing a lot of and the ship flying through space.What strikes one right away is how straightfaced this all is. The tone is entirely serious and somber even when the events of the story are ridiculous which sets it apart from other space comedies like The Ice Pirates which I just watched and whose music offers a clue to the wacky tone throughout. Not here.Anyway so we're introduced to our crew including Sarge who is first seen doing rows and smoking a cigar. He looks a bit like Jackson Browne. There's another prettier guy and Captain Corneilius Butt who is hilariously introduced at the climax of a 2001like buildup. They hang out for a bit with Butt torturing a captive alien for a while before they encounter a Darth Vaderlike alien who engages then in a space fight. There they are deadlocked and waiting for one ship's shields to fail first and then all of a sudden it's over with no explanation and they just proceed about their business.Now Galaxina who wears a white outfit that can accurately be described as formfitting cannot speak and touching her say when you're reaching round to goose her delivers an electric shock. Then Captain Butt eats a disgusting space egg and burps up an Alientype creature which escapes into the ship. Then Sarge declares his love for Galaxina and endures a painful shock just to embrace her for a moment.They are then ordered to go fetch the Blue Star every mention of which cues a burst on the soundtrack like upon the utterance of Frau Bluerheher in Young Frankenstein. They will have to go into cryosleep for 27 years to get there and 27 more to get back which they are justifiably annoyed about. But all is forgiven when they are offered ONE night of rec leave. What does this say about the priorities of the working classes? So they spend one night in a space brothel where they are entertained by a variety of strange female aliens. This sequence is obviously modeled on the cantina sequence from Star Wars and features makeup that is comparable to that movie. Then into cryosleep. While in cryosleep the little alien comes out and tries to dethaw Captain Butt but cannot figure out the code and eventually gives up with a whimper.While the guys are in cryosleep Galaxina who has fallen in love with Sarge teaches herself to speak and makes her body warm and soft. Upon thawing him out she offers herself to him saying that she'll make his every wish her command. Then she is kidnapped by space bikers who are going to sacrifice her to the god Har Lee David Son when she is rescued they get the blue star the end.Somewhere in here is a funny commercial that says Do you have a drinking problem? Then come on down to Happy Hour Spirits! We've got all the booze you need! So what of it? It's obviously a highly silly thing that wears out its welcome after an hourwhy do all movies HAVE to be at least 90 minutes? but what's strange is that the tone throughout is sort of spacey and somber which makes all the supposedly funny scenes and wackiness have a strange kind of hypnotic sadness and loneliness. That's the most notable thing about this movie well I guess aside from Stratten but it's not really enough to make watching it worthwhile.And what of Stratten? She is pretty and has a great body showcased throughout but it seems odd for a movie which seems to exist mostly to highlight her and her charms that she remains fully covered throughout and doesn't really even do much that's outwardly sexy. Huh. Stratten is the subject of Bob Fosse's Star 80 which is now comfortably ensconced in my rental list.There is an easter egg where you can click on the spaceship in the middle of the menu leading you to alien audition footage which is really three pieces of primitive computer animation. The most convincing explanation is that some guy who worked on the DVD had these student projects in computer animation and couldn't bear to see them just thrown out.That's about it. Not really worth seeking out unless you want to oogle Stratten but not really painful to sit through. Another one of those strange oddities and odd it definitely is that was made for some reason that remains unclear. Hey check out Cinema de Merde my website devoted to bad and cheesy movies. You can get the url from my email address above...".

This film is one of those rare gems that transcends its own badness. It is so supremely awful that it becomes great.....Much like Woody Allen.Enjoy!";

A DVD for one pound sterling seemed to qualify for that category. So we watched it together and I have to say I was the only one who admitted loving Galaxina. Okay it's not the funniest movie ever made however I made me and the others laugh. Not always when it was probably intended...To put it in a nutshell I have seen much worse movies and after all Galaxina isn't taking itself seriously either. It's worth reading about Dorothy Stratten Galaxina and her fate here on IMDb or the web.So give it a chance!Martin".

	schema:reviewBody "Daffy scifi spoof from director William SachsThe Incredible Melting Man has a space crew commissioned to find a blue crystal dueling with a villainous mechanical creature also desiring it. The film's titular character is played by Dorothy Stratton hired it seems based on her sexiness..she does look mighty fine in her tight space suitalone for she remains rather robotic..written as a robot allows her to look great without worry of delivering a meaningful performancethroughout. Stephen Macht is a crew member in love with Galaxina but is not allowed to touch her due to programming wiring her to shock anyone who makes contact. Soon however somehow Galaxina finds a way to feel an emotional attachment to him and while the crew are in suspended animation for decades due to their ship's inability to hyperjump through space as other more superior travel vessels readjusting her programing so she can develop more intimacy with the man she loves. Sachs' film homages Kubrick's 2001 by featuring almost exclusively classical composers' works as the score to Galaxina. You get spirited homages to Star Wars as Sachs' film features an alien western bar where humans are on the menu and an intergalactic brothel..oh Sachs you sly devil you!where weary travelers can unwind. The budget for the ship interiors costumes and special effects involving the space vessels are quite small. There are lots of ugly rubbersuited creatures..including a rockeating monster with piranha teeth kept prisoner in the ship for swallowing the Queen's jewelsand ghastly makeup effects on the faces of many humans portraying alien humanoids. While not always hitting the mark Sachs provides enough for fans of popular scifi films of the time..including an inspired homage to Aliento keep his audience entertained. Avery Schreiber is the captain of the ship with James D Hinton as Macht's sidekick wearing a cowboy hat and a soiled Dodgers jersey. The planet of Altar where the blue crystal is located is a place where the worst of the galaxies retreat including a gang of leather hoods who worship a Harley Davidson motorcycle as it's god and plenty of ghoulish alien monsters. Other crew members under Captain Cornelius ButtSchreidberinclude Lionel Mark Smith as Maurice with pointy ears and batlike wings and Tad Horino as a pipesmoking chinaman always offering words of wisdom rejected by his peers..they are the ones with the responsibility of the ship's engineering keeping the rust bucket up and running. I think this is the kind of flick to watch on those dead afternoons when nothing's happening and you want to waste 80 minutes. Stratton is mighty nice to gaze upon for 80 minutes as well.".

The sound is bad the lighting is bad ... it just seems cheaply made overly so. The dialog ... well often it is missing  many awkward silences they are all just standing around and it seems like someone should be saying something. The film even seems ambivalent about what it wants to be  it is not always clear that it was intended as a comedy  like maybe that developed after shooting started. It feels like someone's film project that they threw together the night before it was due and if they had put two weeks into it it could have been good.And I'm easy to please. I thought Mom and Dad Save the World was a hoot. I like Pluto Nash. Mystery Men is one of my favorite movies. Spaced Invaders is well nigh unto a classic. This turkey just doesn't do it.

Dorothy Stratten is OK in her role but not particularly noteworthy.Oh yeah the My watch is always slow. line was funny. I'll give this movie all the kudos it can get it needs it.The space vehicle models are not bad but they are few and are not used effectively. The space scenes are vague. No sweeping passes no close up detailed flybys not even appropriate action scenes when they dock. The Infinity does crash land very oddly at one point. The flight dynamics are terrible worse than anything you've seen they're jerky not smooth. The initial battle is stilted and static even though the two ships have just shown that they can maneuver in their jerky fashion they trade slow shots at close range in a manner that is more reminiscent of a 16th century sea battle except not as exciting.The aliens  imagine if all of Star Wars was the cantina scene. That many rubber masks could get dull rather rapidly no? A few are used as sight gags that work OK the first time but not the fifth.Mercifully if you attempt to watch Galaxina you are likely to fall asleep. I got busy doing something else and missed the last ten minutes and did not feel like it was worth replaying it. If that doesn't say It sucked I don't know what does. Sadly there is a lot of potential and this could easily have been a good movie. It would be easy to remake this and have a decent film.MadKaugh".

There ship is suddenly attacked by an unknown space ship. Enters Sergeant Thor and his partner Buzz as they try to figure out who the unknown ship belongs to. When failing they call on Captain Comelius who instructs his crew to fight back. Enters the gorgeous Dorothy Stratton who plays the role of Galaxina who is man made robot. An now a few thoughts on this picture. This movie was plan stupid and it's one of the reasons that I don't get into SciFi. If you're into SciFi you would have notice that the laser sound effects were borrowed from an early Scifi movie titled Battlestar Galactica which aired in theaters in 1978. Many of the door sounds that you hear in this movie came from another SciFi movie that aired back in 1966 titled Star Trek. Now for the reason that I bought this movie Dorothy Stratton. She is gorgeous in her one piece suit. I think her talents were wasted in this picture and she should have never been involved in such garbage. Connie Sellecca was also considered for the role and her talents would have been wasted also. On the picture alone I give this movie 1 weasel star and on Dorothy Stratton I give her 10 weasel stars even though she didn't deserve to be put into a trash movie like this. If you like pictures like this you can get the DVD version on Amazon.com".

The rest of the cast are also good or as good as the dodgy dialogue will let them be.I would compare this to SPACEBALLS but I think this is far better it doesn't have the budget or the cast of SPACEBALLS but still does a damn good job at being dumb entertainment.

	schema:reviewBody "Sometimes movies are SO bad you just laugh anyway. There are exceptions such as Barfly. Worst movie ever made. I know loads of people who saw this movie at my house and almost everyone giggled at the silliness or moaned in pain at a really bad one liner. The movie is not the greatest in the world but good enough for bad science fiction fans. The idea of the movie might be used today and rewritten.

She was also regarded as a promising upandcoming actress and had appeared in three films when in August 1980 she was murdered by her estranged husband Paul Snider who was jealous of her relationship with the film director Peter Bogdanovich. Snider committed suicide immediately after killing Dorothy. I have never seen Dorothy's first film Autumn Born or her third They All Laughed her only appearance in a major Hollywood studio production. I did however see Galaxina when it was recently shown on a British movie channel and I was left wishing I hadn't. The less said about its plot the better. It's supposed to be a comedy set on board the Intergalactic Space Police cruiser Infinity in the year 3008 and what plot there is deals with the ship's journey to the distant planet Altair One to recover a priceless stolen gemstone called the Blue Star with a subplot about the love affair which develops between the ship's secondincommand Sergeant Thor and a beautiful female robot named Galaxina. This might seem to be a doomed romance but we are solemnly assured that by the thirtyfirst century science has been able to create machines which are capable of feeling emotions. Actually although Galaxina is supposed to be a robot she doesn't look like one at all. In fact she looks just like Playboy's Playmate of the Year for 3008. Assuming that is that Playboy still be published that fardistant date. The film attempts to generate humour by parodying mainstream science fiction films and television programmes such as Star Wars Star Trek and the Alien series. Like some other spoof movies from this period Top Secret! being another example it uses a scattergun approach not confining its parody to one sole genre. Besides scifi it also tries to send up Westerns and biker movies like The Wild One or Easy Rider the inhabitants of Altair One are all members of biker gangs and worship a god known as HarleeDavidSon. I can't think what the origin of that particular name might be!The problem with aiming at so many different targets is that you will end up missing all of them. As Mel Brooks demonstrated in Blazing Saddles and Spaceballs it is possible to satirise effectively both the Western and the space epic. It is probably not a good idea to attempt both in the same film. All the humour in Galaxina is leaden and pointless simply calling a character with oddshaped ears Mr Spot rather than Mr Spock does not amount to a witty comment on Star Trek. The quality of the acting is just as bad as the quality of the script. If the advanced technology of 3008 has been able to endow robots not only with consciousness but also with emotions you would not guess so from Stratten's performance. Galaxina might look like a beautiful woman but acts like a soulless machine. To be fair to Stratten her co stars if one can legitimately use the word star about actors so lacking in star quality are even worse. Their performances might lead one to conclude that the greatest triumph of thirtyfirst century science has been not to endow robots with a personality but to remove all traces of personality from the human race.This was one of a number of lowbudget science fiction films which were rushed out in the late seventies and early eighties to cash in on the scifi boom started by Star Wars. Some of these such as the British made Flash Gordon are quite endearing but some of them are every bit as bad as the worst of the so bad they're funny scifi films of the fifties such as the notorious Plan 9 from Outer Space. Galaxina falls firmly into this latter category. Indeed I would rate it as the worst post1970 scifi film I have ever seen along with the equally dismal British Inseminoid also from 1980. The film is still remembered for the tragic fate of its leading lady. It does not deserve to be remembered for anything else. 110".

I don't want to give the story away but it revolves around a boy who looks for a girl to marry. Of course in every Hindi film there is a bad man which dies i think lol hm at the end the boy realises he isn't who he thought he was i can't say anymore coz i'll spoil the story but watch it its kind of funny sometimes.".

This movie ranks as one of the greatest achievements of the commercial cinema genre. The rest of the cast apart from ShammiSharmila and Pran are just about enough for their roles.

	schema:reviewBody "THE PIRATE was a definite departure from the typical fare MGM was churning out during the 40's and 50's and audiences let MGM know immediately that this was not the kind of thing they were accustomed to because for the most part audiences stayed away in droves and sadly missed one of the most colorful and imaginative offerings to come from the MGM stable. THE PIRATE was the second of three films that Judy Garland and Gene Kelly appeared in together. Judy delivers a smart comic performance as Manuela a Spanish princess engaged to a rich and sleazy nobleman Walter Slezakthough at night she dreams of being with an enigmatic pirate she has heard tales of called Macoco or Mack the Black. Manuela meets Serafin Gene Kelly an actor in a traveling troupe and mistakes him for Macoco and it is this bit of mistaken identity upon which the thin plot thread resolves. Vincente Minnelli once again shows his penchant and eye for color with some outstanding scenery and art direction as well as some state of the art special effects for 1948. Despite looking frail Garland delivers an on target comic performance as Manuela and her voice in fine form as usual resonates on the rousing Mack the Black and is equally compelling on the beautiful ballad Love of My Life. Gene Kelly is at the peak of his on screen charm and physical and dancing prowess as the witty Serafin and makes the Pirate Ballet fantasy a must see for musical fans and it goes without saying that his duet with Garland Be a Clown is a classic. Kelly also does an amazing dance number with the Nicholas Brothers. Vincente Minnelli's magical eye the voice of Garland the charisma of Kelly and Cole Porter music...what else do you need?".

To be honest it's really Kelly's movie. Garland was having problems at the time and Minnelli decided to give him ample opportunity with additional dance numbers excluding Garland.

How strange that it isn't better known.In one of their rare moments of scenic largesse Metro released Garland from the small town confinements of Hardyville andor the sweet girl who makes it to Broadway with the corn stalks still in her suitcase and gave her something of genuine wit and sophistication.For here she is Manuela Alvarez of the colonial Virgin Islands a well born cloistered 19th century maiden presumably convent educated i.e. Gladys Cooper to Judy ...we'll take refuge in the church! whose only psychic escape from her self enclosure consists in fantasizing about the notorious pirate Mack the Black Macoco. That she is tricked into believing a dashing actor Serafin Kelly is the real Macoco while in fact he is none other than her lumpy affianced Mayor Dom Pedro Walter Slezak is the spindle upon which this cinematic yarn spins its glories.And what phantasmagoric glories they are! This ranks with Yolanda and the Thief sorry American in Paris fans as Mr. Minnelli's most accomplished Technicolor visual achievement. For working with Jack Martin Smith he concocts a Caribbean sea port a swirl with color and charactersone can almost smell the salt air a waft with spice and languor and including as well a quay brimming with turbanned negroe vendors a village of Salmon and off white stucco walls and black filagreed wrought iron against a cerulean sky and bevys of extras dressed in a fortune worth of rainbow colored moire velvet and brocade flounces furbellows snoods and gauntlets. The shaded interiors are replete with empire furniture carved ebony and bamboo blinds and palmettos.The effect is dreamlike in an operetta sort of way and deliberately so. A storybook come to life but one which successfully combines the conventions of 19th century aristocratic propriety in which young women of quality do not walk out without their duennas against 20th century show biz colloquialisms to great effect one thinks here of Mr. Kelly's delightful reference to a review in the Trinidad Clarion comparing him to David GarrickNo Noose is Good Noose and You should try underplaying sometime. The players are at the top of their form Mr. Kelly is in full command of his powers here his partnering with the Nicholas Brothers in Be a Clown as well as the Pirate Ballet in which he pivots with a javelin against a cinnabar sky lit with explosions almost literally take ones breath away.But it is in Ninia that he achieves the most felicitous display of solo Terpsichore with Robert Alton's choreography Harry Stradling's fluid boom camera following his cat like moves over up and through the town and the delightful Cole Porter lyric and melody culminating in flamenco steps with torrid and tempting MGM contract dancers in and through the striped poles of a circular gazebo.Of Miss Garland enough cannot be said. No more Betsy Booth! Manuela offers her a chance to broaden her range in a direction in which sadly she would never venture again.Here her exasperated intonations wring humor out of every line and situation Oh Casilda I do wish you were a little more spiritual! or Do you call it fun to live in a tent? to go hungry ? to be looked down on by all decent people?! give full vent to the drollery the script affords. Indeed she channels her trademarked nervous energy into her character in such a way that she as Parent's Magazine noted in its review gently spoofs some of her earlier film characterizations. Thus we get the Dorothy like I know it something dreadful is going to happen something dreadful... It's a performance that one cannot simply imagine any other actress playing. Thus she claims the role and makes it her own.And who can forget the scene where she pretends to believe Serafin is Macoco once she has discovered the deception I can see us now you with your cutlass in one hand and your compass in the other shouting orders to your pirate crew and I I spurring you on to greater and greater achievements won't that be magnificent?! to which she pounds her fist against the table with sugar dipped venom.Musically she is also a delight from start to finish.Moreover she has never been seen to such pictorial advantage in the post war period as she is here gowned by Tom Keogh and Madame Karinska in one of the most arresting and beaded! wardrobes she ever wore on screen and just as importantly effectively coiffed throughout most particularly in the Love of My Life sequence where she is adorned with a coral diadem and matching earrings. Similarly her closeups are meltingly lovely such as the nightgown clad scene wherein she begs Gladys Cooper to take her to Port Sebastian I'll make him a good wife Aunt Inezreally. what a vision in feminine charm she is here! or slightly later when clad in a broad brimmed straw hat she gazes upon the Caribbean or perhaps best of all with a conch shell at her ear and under hypnosis she whispers of Macoco to dazzled interlocutors.Supporting players are top of the mark and it is interesting to see Garland interact with Gladys Cooper and horror veteran George Zucco.After it was completed MGM relegated Garland back to formula vaudeville hokum but thankfully The Pirate was already in the can.

	schema:reviewBody "In its classic era Hollywood was not a place where artistes could conceive and execute projects exactly to plan. Often a production would change hands get scrapped revived or overhauled completely into a new genre according to changing needs and resources. That's not an admonition  it's simply the way they created quality entertainment. The Pirate was not the first straightahead comedy drama to receive a musical makeover halfway through production.MGM in the middle of what would one day be known as its golden age of musicals probably thought they were onto an easy winner because they had all the finest musical talent of the day at their disposal. They brought in Arthur Freed to produce Vincente Minnelli to direct with Judy Garland and Gene Kelly as stars. They even managed to coax Cole Porter into writing the score. It couldn't fail... could it? The trouble is such hasty talent stuffing sometimes backfires. Let's begin with the two leads. Garland had worked continuously since childhood and was by now only being kept going with the amphetamines she would eventually become hooked on. She was running out of steam and it shows in her rather uneven performance veering from theatrical exaggeration to bizarre dopedup eroticism. Kelly by contrast was at the top of his game but he looks daft in that moustache and his performance relies more on his secondrate acrobats than his firstrate dancing. Garland and Kelly are however fantastic in the comical ornamentsmashing scene. This is easily the best moment in the picture which just goes to show how underused their musical abilities are.Vincente Minnelli was by now established as a unique and highly effective director of musicals. He had a method of giving character and dynamics to every number making the camera and the colours part of the choreography. A great example is the song Nina which is shot entirely in two or three continuous takes. Minnelli leads us into the song tracking over to the Nina in the boldest colours then alights on one Nina after another delicately framing each in a painterly composition. He holds our interest throughout this long routine with the camera in close to establish the premise of the number then moving out to show off Kelly's athletics moving in again for the cigarettekiss trick before moving out again for the final group dance. It's just a shame that The Pirate has too few songs and not nearly enough dance.Minnelli was also a competent director of nonmusical action particularly crowd scenes. His expert use of camera movement provides Kelly with a fantastic entrance. We dolly back through the crowds focus on a crate with the acting company's details on it then pull back and up to reveal Kelly being hoisted aloft. Shortly after this comes a bit of a misfire though. Minnelli for very good reasons often liked to keep actors in midshot rather than closeup drawing attention to them through use of framing and movement. As Kelly strolls through the crowd advertising his company we are focused on him because he is very animated while his audience are unnaturally still. It gives what should be a lively moment a sense of emptiness and I can't help thinking of the real world audience getting bored wondering when the first musical number will strike up.As for Cole Porter's music it's far from his best. The plot is as Kelly later pointed out a huge inside joke that it took audiences twenty years to get although if it was at the expense of Douglas Fairbanks wasn't it also being made twenty years too late? The MGM studiobound look is particularly stifling for such an exotic adventuresome setting. All in all The Pirate has plenty of colouring but not enough flavour and is one of the most disappointing of MGM musicals.".

It couldn't fail... could it? The trouble is such hasty talent stuffing sometimes backfires. Let's begin with the two leads. Garland had worked continuously since childhood and was by now only being kept going with the amphetamines she would eventually become hooked on. She was running out of steam and it shows in her rather uneven performance veering from theatrical exaggeration to bizarre dopedup eroticism. Kelly by contrast was at the top of his game but he looks daft in that moustache and his performance relies more on his secondrate acrobats than his firstrate dancing. Garland and Kelly are however fantastic in the comical ornamentsmashing scene. This is easily the best moment in the picture which just goes to show how underused their musical abilities are.Vincente Minnelli was by now established as a unique and highly effective director of musicals. He had a method of giving character and dynamics to every number making the camera and the colours part of the choreography. A great example is the song Nina which is shot entirely in two or three continuous takes. Minnelli leads us into the song tracking over to the Nina in the boldest colours then alights on one Nina after another delicately framing each in a painterly composition. He holds our interest throughout this long routine with the camera in close to establish the premise of the number then moving out to show off Kelly's athletics moving in again for the cigarettekiss trick before moving out again for the final group dance. It's just a shame that The Pirate has too few songs and not nearly enough dance.Minnelli was also a competent director of nonmusical action particularly crowd scenes. His expert use of camera movement provides Kelly with a fantastic entrance. We dolly back through the crowds focus on a crate with the acting company's details on it then pull back and up to reveal Kelly being hoisted aloft. Shortly after this comes a bit of a misfire though. Minnelli for very good reasons often liked to keep actors in midshot rather than closeup drawing attention to them through use of framing and movement. As Kelly strolls through the crowd advertising his company we are focused on him because he is very animated while his audience are unnaturally still. It gives what should be a lively moment a sense of emptiness and I can't help thinking of the real world audience getting bored wondering when the first musical number will strike up.As for Cole Porter's music it's far from his best. The plot is as Kelly later pointed out a huge inside joke that it took audiences twenty years to get although if it was at the expense of Douglas Fairbanks wasn't it also being made twenty years too late? The MGM studiobound look is particularly stifling for such an exotic adventuresome setting. All in all The Pirate has plenty of colouring but not enough flavour and is one of the most disappointing of MGM musicals.";

Judy Garland is ravishing as the sheltered Manuela who is doomed and forced to marry a man she doesn't love Don Pedro. Then along comes Gene Kelly as a twobit actor who falls for Manuela and tricks her along with the entire Caribbean village into thinking he is the notorious pirate Macoco AKA Mack the Black. Stylishly directed by Vincente Minnelli and wonderfully choreographed this is one of the better musicals during MGM's golden age of musical productions. Everything here is quite campy especially Kelly's performance which is so over the top and outrageous you won't know whether to laugh or cringe. Take it as pure fun and entertainment. This is a great musical with some good numbers phenomenal dancing and two really good looking actors at the top of their game. The Pirate is so much fun.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gene Kelly and Judy Garland stepped into some mighty big shoes when they accepted the lead roles in The Pirate. On Broadway The Pirate ran in the 194243 season for 177 performances and the shoes that Kelly and Garland were filling belonged to Alfred Lunt and Lynne Fontanne. True it's probably one of the lighter vehicles that Lunt and Fontanne ever did still it might have been interesting to compare what they did with the snappy dialog of S.N. Behrmann.Cole Porter signed on to write the score for this musical adaption of The Pirate. Porter had been in a creative dry spell for a few years most notoriously he was associated with a flop musical based on Around The World In 80 Days a couple of years back. Believe it or not he was having trouble getting work in Hollywood and on Broadway when he signed with MGM for The Pirate.According to the George Eells biography of Porter it was Gene Kelly who asked Porter to write a clown number for him and Judy Garland. Porter responded with Be A Clown which turned out to be the hit of the film. The rest of the score is not top drawer Porter but mediocre Cole Porter is better than most songwriters can come up with.Judy Garland plays another starry eyed youngster in The Pirate which is set in the 18th century Caribbean. She's first seen reading what would later be called a dime novel about the legendary Makoko the Pirate. She's getting into an arranged marriage with the mayor of the town staid and settled Walter Slezak. When a troupe of strolling players led by Gene Kelly come to town under hypnosis she reveals that she longs to be the bride of Makoko. What's Gene Kelly to do but pretend to be Makoko.That's all well and good except that Walter Slezak is the real Makoko now just trying to live in peaceful obscurity away from the authorities who want to hang him. All this leads to some interesting complications that of course get all sorted out in the end.Judy gets to do two ballads in her unmistakable style Love Of My Life and You Can Do No Wrong. And she stars in a rousing production number where the proclaims her enchantment with the legendary Makoko in Mack The Black. The film got a tepid response in 1948 it's given far better critical notice in retrospect. The Pirate was produced by MGM's legendary Arthur Freed and his unit and directed stylishly by Vincent Minnelli who was Judy Garland's husband at the time. Today's audiences would far better appreciate the combined wit of S.N. Behrmann and Cole Porter.As for Porter his next writing assignment would stop all talk of his going into decline. The following year Kiss Me Kate debuted on Broadway which was Porter's biggest critical and commercial success. No one ever said that score wasn't up to his usual standard.".

While Judy Garland's The Wizard Of Oz and Meet Me In St Louis are wellknown and loved and Gene Kelly's Singin In The Rain and An American In Paris are equally revered and adored The Pirate slips under the radar. Why is it not better known? With great musical numbers a witty script and endearing humorous and very charismatic performances from the two stars it SHOULD be talked about more often.Garland looking small and not entirely well yet capable of producing gusto when needed! plays the heroine Manuela who is about to be married off to the rich mayor Don Pedro Walter Slezak of the fictional town of Calvados in the Caribbean. However Manuela is not enthused about the marriage and instead dreams of being taken off like a chickenhawk by the legendary pirate Macoco. Enter travelling player Serafin Gene Kelly a charming dashing womanising entertainer who sees Manuela and instantly falls in love. Prepare for a wonderful delightful ride as Kelly hypnotizes Garland masquerades as Macoco eventually reveals the REAL Macoco to Garland and the audience and wins his leading lady's heart by the end of the film! This lovely musical is an affectionate yet sharp sendup of the swashbucklers of Fairbanks Barrymore and Flynn from now and thenyesteryear. Garland and Kelly both give deliciously comic performances that are quite unlike the rest of their body of work. Kelly in particular is just wonderful and both stars get to deliver great Cole Porter tunes. Nina is now one of my favourite Kelly numbers Mack The Black has Garland in fine form and Be A Clown is just a classic tune. Minnelli's trademark exquisite use of Technicolour and expert stageing of the musical sequences truly filmic and seemingly effortlessly integrated is also on show here.The Pirate is essentially about a young woman finding love whilst also being able to express herself. Manuela realises she doesn't really want to be carried off like a chickenhawk by a hulking pirate nor does she want to be married to a rich man surrounded by fine things yet have no opinion or selfworth. She instead desires love where there is also mutual appreciation support and fun. Kelly's Serafin offers her all those things and the chance to be truly be herself. Any wonder why Manuela eventually falls for Serafin? Combine those elements with some fun supporting work from Slezak and Gladys Cooper and you have an excellent film that should be better known.

	schema:headline " A musical that just doesn't gel";
	schema:reviewBody "Sixty years ago the musical 'The Pirate' was a flop. Now in the 21st century it can be said to have taken on a new life as a cult......flop.It's a harsh but tempting aphorism. On the face of it the film has everything going for it  Technicolor MGM production values Cole Porter songs Gene Kelly and Judy Garland as the stars melodrama athleticism and homage to Douglas Fairbanks  but somehow it fails to come together into a convincing whole. Everyone overacts especially the principals and the unintended result of all this ham is that it's hard to find any of them very sympathetic.The basic setup of the plot is not without promise  that of the fake who's more convincing than the real thing  but while I don't know the original play I'm not sure that rewriting as a star vehicle for Judy Garland's benefit did it any favours. This isn't one of her best roles and her performance as the histrionic and selfdeluding Manuela is shrill and lacking in appeal. Gene Kelly looking rather more comfortable in his costumes than she does in hers fills the shoes of the vain showman Serafin more adequately with the charm and virility required by the part  but after the opportunistic opening number it's hard to credit the sincerity of his character's affections.There is no real dramatic tension save for the scene in the square after the Viceroy arrives when we finally begin to care about the characters' fate... but any suspicion of serious intent is then rapidly washed away by the shoehornedin 'Be a Clown' routine. A classic it may have become but it really doesn't belong here bearing all too clearly the signs of having been inserted at the last minute in an attempt to obtain at least one 'hit' in a sadly unmemorable score. The subsequent inevitable reprise of this number with Judy Garland in clownface is more than a little tired we've seen the urchinact to better effect in 'Easter Parade' and will see it trotted out once more in 'A Star is Born'.

None of this would matter if only the film's story would take fire... but alas by and large it doesn't. Kelly's dance sequences are effective if largely divorced from the plot Garland's songs less so ranging from the forgettable to the embarrassing 'Mack the Black' and 'the CaRIBbean Sea'  really!Something might have been made of this property  though not as a Judy Garland vehicle  but Minnelli's 'The Pirate' isn't it.

	onyx:emotionText "Sixty years ago the musical 'The Pirate' was a flop. Now in the 21st century it can be said to have taken on a new life as a cult......flop.It's a harsh but tempting aphorism. On the face of it the film has everything going for it  Technicolor MGM production values Cole Porter songs Gene Kelly and Judy Garland as the stars melodrama athleticism and homage to Douglas Fairbanks  but somehow it fails to come together into a convincing whole. Everyone overacts especially the principals and the unintended result of all this ham is that it's hard to find any of them very sympathetic.The basic setup of the plot is not without promise  that of the fake who's more convincing than the real thing  but while I don't know the original play I'm not sure that rewriting as a star vehicle for Judy Garland's benefit did it any favours. This isn't one of her best roles and her performance as the histrionic and selfdeluding Manuela is shrill and lacking in appeal. Gene Kelly looking rather more comfortable in his costumes than she does in hers fills the shoes of the vain showman Serafin more adequately with the charm and virility required by the part  but after the opportunistic opening number it's hard to credit the sincerity of his character's affections.There is no real dramatic tension save for the scene in the square after the Viceroy arrives when we finally begin to care about the characters' fate... but any suspicion of serious intent is then rapidly washed away by the shoehornedin 'Be a Clown' routine.

	schema:headline " Wonderful fantasy musical with feminist themes";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is among my personal favorites of the less successful MGM musicals. There's really no good reason why this was not a hit I can only fantasize about a period of time in the 1940s when so many great films were being made with so many fantastic stars like Gene Kelly and Judy Garland that people could actually overlook a film as fun and beautiful as this one is.Kelly is more impressive in the film than Garland who doesn't look like she's 100 healthy. I get a strong feeling that Kelly is living out a childhood Doug Fairbanks fantasy he does some stunts in the balletic sequence that really do look dangerous and AltonKellyMinnelli go out of their way to show Kelly's face so that you know that it's really him. This ballet sequence serves the same function as many other dream sequences in Minnelli's films expressing a psychological transition for the protagonist at the same time as expressing a wishfulfillment in this case Manuela's attraction shifting to Serafin and Serafin's own egofantasy as the dashing outlaw.Garland does really show off her great comic timing this is one of those movies where the characters are definitely just modern types planted in the middle of a historical setting and humorous anachronisms and slang abound. To fit the light farcical mood director Minnelli and designer Gibbons have created a rarified cinematic Caribbean unlike any real world place in any time an effect similar to the faerietale South of his Cabin in the Sky but which more specifically modifies the visual motifs of Yolanda and the Thief. The photography by Harry Stradling is some of the best you will ever see in a musical film particularly impressive are the firelit Mack the Black and Pirate dreamballet.The film functions either as a fanciful escape or as an almost satirical statement about the battle of the sexes and sexual politics in general  which reaches a peak rarely equaled in musical history in the famous scene when Manuela throws every object within each at Seraphin. Manuela starts off in a situation that's so degrading and abject that even in the context of the more paternal 40s culture it would have been disturbing  for example when Manuela's guardianaunt Gladys Cooper informs her that she doesn't need to meet her fianc because he's not marrying you to hear you talk. Manuela has the desire to see the world and travel and her affianced simply says he's been theredone that and I'll tell you all about it. Manuela in other words is a virtual slave in her society which adds dark humor to her rejection of the lowly actor Serafin which forces him to masquerade as the apparently more socially acceptable pirate the irony here is accented neonsign style by the scene where Judy pretends to be mourning as she prepares to meet Macoco. Macoco is a symbol of freedom for Manuela  and the film really gets interesting because although of course Serafin isn't really Macoco he does really offer her not only the chance to travel but also through the Art of Mesmer undreamedof opportunities for selfexpression through music and roleplaying none of which as we noted above the real Macoco has any interest in offering her. The pivotal moments in their romance all involve roleplaying and the film shamelessly milks the irony of these rolereversals as the situational comedy rises to a crescendo. Serafim is hooked on Manuela as soon as he sees her performance and her effect on the audience when she sings Mack the Black one of Porter's better tunes for this film. Then we have Sarafin attempting to woo her by pretending to be the romantic pirate. But we really don't know if she loves him until she has discovered his true identity and engages in roleplaying of her own briefly convincing Serafin that she buys his act long enough to makes some humorously offensive comments about his acting abilities. At the moment Serafin realizes he's been had we know they're in love  and Manuela immediately proceeds with an orgasmic barrage of projectiles. This scene functions to humble the Serafin character also and his perseverance in the face of such an assault assures us that his womanizing Nina days are over. The flirtation is consummated when the 2 collaborate in performance and fool Macoco into revealing his identity. There's nowhere else for the film to go from there and the couple celebrate their new love and freedom of expression with Be a Clown  whoever says this song does not fit into the story is missing something I think.It's definitely not Porter's best work because the ballads feel a bit underwhelming compared to the dance numbers throwing the film irretrievably into Kelly's lap. But we have here a glorious entertaining musical that shows off the talents of 2 great stars. We also have guest performers who add a lot  particularly Slezak's greasy turn as the real pirate seeking social respectability and the incomparable dancing team of the Nicholas Brothers who join Kelly in a groundbreaking interracial dance. And we have a story that provides ample situational comedy and reveals layers of contemplation about the space between fantasy and reality and shows us how true love can sometimes be found in the place where fantasy and reality converge  on the theater stage where fiction reveals its ironic truth and a hungry audience expects to be surprised. Thus I think this film anticipates the theme of Minnelli's great Band Wagon with its celebration of entertainment and also forms like his later Gigi a softly delivered message about female liberation. Manuela has found not the promised quiet domesticity planned for her nor the fantasy of pirate abduction both of which are simply different or opposed axes of male domination but instead a lover who respects her and a way of life that will encourage her to express and explore her emotions.".

First of all this movie is about the Carribean. Now does fairskinned white as an angel Judy Garland look even the least bit like a Carribean dame? Kelly passes off with his mustache.   As I said before look for the humor. The best scenes in brief 1. Judy Garland's fight with Gene Kelly in which she cuts him in the butt with her sword 2. Judy and Gene's Mack the Black song. Judy sounds all right Gene dances all right and Vincente directs all right. But that's just it. It should've been TERRIfIC! A litle more effort and this movie would've won an Academy Award. There are a few little steamy parts in here. Judy sings to Gene and Gene looks at her with such loving awe that you can't help but love them both. I liked this movie. 810".

Again the fire sequence was put to better more comical use in Bandwagon and I would vote for Judy Garland any time in the director's own Meet Me in St Louis where the songs and plot are so beautifully wed. In The Pirate they seem to be tacked on and the dance sequences seem disconnected and long. If Gene Kelly could only have taken a hint from Fred Astaire about when and how much to sing...neither had much of a voice but Astaire dealt with it intelligently. The films mentioned above were all made at later dates though and maybe that's why I feel unhappy about my reaction.Curtis Stotlar".

One comment that I'm surprised to read so much on this site is on the outdated but wellmeaning casting of white actors as Caribbeans.

Sure. I can accept the premise of the cast for one main reason Gene Kelly using his considerable clout with the studio made a point of racially integrating the background population in PIRATE's Caribbean exteriors note all the people of color in the 'Port Sebastian' sequence just working for a living and to specifically include the Nicholas Brothers in the film's athletic climax Be A Clown.

The story also manages to be cute and silly without degenerating into complete nonsense. Gene Kelly does a pretty impressive job during to musical numbers at times he seems to defy gravity effortlessly.  One can't help but be impressed. The real jewel of this film though is Judy Garland.  I couldn't tell you exactly what it is about her but she is absolutely fantastic in this film. Her facial expressions body language and tone of voice especially when her character is irritated and absolutely irresistable.  Even if this movie was terrible it would be worth watching just for her performance.On the downside the musical numbers do get a little exhausting and seem just too long for their own good.  Yes Gene Kelly can sing and dance but somewhere around the tenth minute of Be a Clown I felt like driving a dull steak knife through my skull.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Pirate 1948 is about the ebullient actor Serafin Gene Kelly who comes to a small Caribbean town and falls hard for the romantic Manuela Judy Garland. She rejects him saving her love only for the legendary pirate Macoco whom she wishes would steal her away. So Serafin takes on the guise of the notorious pirate in order to win her heart. Though it flopped when released The Pirate has become a cult classic often hailed as being ahead of its time. I've seen the film twice and still fail to see the appeal.Don't get me wrong I love Gene Kelly Judy Garland and Cole Porter. Vincent Minelli is not among my favorite directors but I usually admire his colorful style. It feels like someone got the most delicious ingredients for an ice cream sundae and ended up botching it big time to the point where it's almost inedible. Porter's score is among his most unmemorable. Outside of Be a Clown which is tucked away at the very end I cannot hum a single one of them a big flaw for a musical. The dancing is good though and Gene Kelly is in fine form.Unfortunately the dancing cannot save a lackluster production. Kelly and Garland are stuck playing characters who come off as annoying especially Garland's Manuela who spends most of her screen time shrilly screaming and whining all her lines. Kelly hams it up to the stratosphere which ceases to be funny fast. The comedy plays much better in the more underplayed scenes like when Manuela is going off to sacrifice her virtue to the attractive Macoco to save the town and another girl offers to take her place. Manuela tersely replies He asked for ME. The sets are so stagey they're distracting. While this theatricality works in the ballet dream sequence in the middle of the film or something like the Broadway Melody portion of Singin' in the Rain 1952 here it just comes across as cheap. The costumes are awful garish parodies of 1830s fashion with ugly patterns. Poor Judy gets saddled with the most ridiculous outfits.I know I'll be voted down for this. Ah well such is life. This seems to be a movie a lot of people enjoy and I would never want to take that away from them. I wish I could have enjoyed it too but it's not hard to see why this flopped so hard back in '48.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Pirate is directed by Vincente Minnelli and adapted to screenplay by Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett from the S.N. Behrman play. It stars Gene Kelly Judy Garland Walter Slezak and Gladys Cooper. Music is by Lennie Hayton and Cole Porter and cinematography by Harry Stradling Sr. Gene Kelly plays Serafin an actor who poses as notorious pirate Macoco to win the heart of Manuela Alva Garland because she dreams of being swept away to a life of romantic adventure. By definition it was a troubled production numerous rewrites Garland's battle with prescription drugs impacting on the shooting schedule and audiences turning their backs on a film they wasn't sure how to react too. With the box office results failing to match the production value or the film's ambition it is a film that has for a number of years carried around the tag of being a dud which while it has problems for sure is an unfair reputation given the enjoyment and escapism value available upon viewing it now. The main fault lies with the very poor songs where were it not for the closing Be A Clown which would be copied to become Make 'Em Laugh for Singin' in the Rain four years later then it would be a 100 stinker strike rate for Cole Porter. It's hard to believe the great man could come out with something so bland and boorish as the first song during the story Nia where he even uses a rhyme for schizophrenia! Another minor problem is that Garland is sometimes and unusually over the top in her performance a problem we can probably attribute to her off screen issues since she seems to be grasping the chance to unleash her own form of escapism on screen. However Kelly is on hand to calm her down and steady the ship except for the film's funniest sequence as Manuela throws the entire contents of a room at Serafin! Yet in spite of the problems and this really is no misunderstood masterpiece the film often soars. With gorgeous Technicolor photography opening the eyes fully we get a full on energised Kelly performance his dance with the Nicholas Brothers pumps the blood and taps the feet Slezak doing a wonderful turn as the shifty Don Pedro who Manuela is being coerced into marrying and a Pirate Ballet section of the film that is stunning in choreography and eye popping visuals. There's also some lovely close ups of the two stars they were a great pairing and it's a crying shame they would only make three features together one scene in particular is heart achingly tender. With Minnelli keeping it brisk and mostly keeping it from being too stage bound the simplicity of plot never hurts the film. Fun frothy and flawed indeed. 7.510".

The latter is certainly more famous but truth be told I never cared for it as a song much. Be a Clown' does feature the dancing of the Nicholas Brothers a pair of African American dancers along with Kelly. They are quite good here but if they interest you in the least you've got to do yourself a favor and watch the film Stormy Weather which stars Bill Robinson Lena Horne and Cab Calloway.

	schema:reviewBody "STREET SCENE United Artists 1931 produced by Samuel Goldwyn directed by King Vidor is a remarkable film in many ways. This screen adaptation to Elmer Rice's Pulitzer Prize winning 1929 stage play realistically focuses on a group of people of different ethnic backgrounds who gather together on the front steps of their tenement brownstone apartment building on the west side of Manhattan during a summer heat wave in mid July. The plot set during a 24 hour period takes a look on various residents before centering its attention on the Maurrant family. Anna Maurrant Estelle Taylor a housewife and mother has become so bored with her present existence that she carries on an affair with a married man Steve Sankey Russell Hopton while her stern and unsentimental husband Frank David Landau heads off for work. This illicit affair is known by many thanks to the neighborhood gossip Emma Jones Beulah Bondi. Regardless of their knowledge Frank does have his suspicions as does their grown daughter Rose Sylvia Sidney. Rose is a working girl loved by Sam Kaplan William Collier Jr. a Jewish law student living in the same building. Like Rose Sam longs on moving away to a better life. Although he has strong ambitions his weakness is being a coward especially when constantly bullied by Vincent Matt McHugh a heavyset Momma's Boy. After about an hour or so of realistic dialog the street scene as the title indicates occurs when Frank Maurrant returns home unexpectedly to find the shades of his bedroom window being pulled down. Light on action STREET SCENE moves along very swiftly through numerous camera angles. Aside from its plot development of numerous characters every one of them down to the last extra makes his presence count. With the storyline being limited to only the front portion of the building the inside of the apartment is never shown. Vidor does break away from his limitations in giving the avid movie viewer a eyeview of Manhattan of 1931 ranging from the elevated train a glimpse of the Chrysler Building and other tenement buildings. The opening sequence underscored by Alfred Newman's now classic New York City Theme is priceless ranging from children cooling themselves off from the summer heat as they get splashed on with water from a hose connected to a fire hydrant an alley cat licking a block of ice a family dog stretched out on the sidewalk to cool off and a brief look at those now antique fans. The second act of the story which takes place the following morning goes a bit further with local boys picking up stacks of newspapers to be delivered and a man waking up from a good night's sleep on the fire escape and heading back in his apartment carrying his pillow and sheets through his open window among others. There is also a noted scene in which Willie Lambert Rogers the younger member of the Maurrant family skating down the street pausing yelling up the window to his mother to throw him a dime to buy an ice cream cone. The dime is then wrapped in tissue paper and rubber band and tossed directly to him. Those who recall such childhood memories of New York will definitely relate to these little detailed scenes. Some things though never change notably how a quiet street stirs up a huge crowd whenever an incident occurs as expertly depicted in this photoplay.Seen in the supporting cast are Greta Grandtedt Max Mantor John Qualen George Humbert Allan Fox and Marcia Mae Jones recognizable in her small role as Mary Hildebrand one of the neighborhood children. In fact many of the supporting players appearing in STREET SCENE reprized their roles from the stage version especially that of Beulah Bondi making her screen debut. Always an excellent performer her nasty character nearly steals the film. Sylvia Sidney with few movie credits to her name at the time and a native New Yorker makes a lasting impression with her role as Rose. STREET SCENE is an excellent theme in storytelling that never lets go of its audience. In spite of its age it's still timely. One element that shows King Vidor's style of sending out his messages to his viewers without the use of dialog is the use of closeups and facial expressions on several people. They don't say anything but what they're thinking is passed across its audience. These and many other scenes are what makes STREET SCENE so remarkable even today. Instances such as those depicted are those that could happen anytime anywhere not only in New York but a movie such as this cannot be remade today or ever without the same impact as it did back in 1931. It's a wonder why STREET SCENE did not earn a single Academy Award nomination.STREET SCENE available on video and DVD had been distributed by numerous public domain companies using reissue prints that substitute Samuel Goldwyn's opening with Associate Artists Productions Presents. Other than its occasional TV showings that have turned up on local public broadcasting stations after the midnight hours STREET SCENE occasionally plays Turner Classic Movies. Contrary to its host Robert Osborne in saying in his analysis of STREET SCENE making its TCM premiere on the evening of June 30 2002 at 8 p.m. someone at the program department failed to indicate to him of its earlier airdate June 6 2002 at 730 a.m. Regardless thanks to TCM for ever presenting this rare find due to it being one of the very few from the early 1930s that can still be seen and appreciated over and over again.

There is a first rate ensemble cast including the wonderful Sylvia Sydney as Rose Moran the daughter of an Irish father and American mother. She works in an office with a boss who is after her for more than company. Her father is cold and distant from her lonely mother. Rose finds friendship and love with Sam Kaplan a Russian Jewish neighbor. Despite their religious and ethnic differences there is a genuine and authentic nature of their relationship. You can't help but rooting for them. Beulah Bondi plays nosy opinionated Mrs. Jones who walks her beloved dog Queenie. She's a hoot. The film version does justice since we never see what life is like behind the apartment doors. The tenement building on the Lower East Side of New York City is a mixture of religions and backgrounds Irish Italian Russian Jewish living together and trying to survive in the Great Depression. The film has quite an ending and the tension does build up to it greatly. It's wellwritten and believable as a bunch of neighbors talk in the hot weather with their open windows about the other residents and local gossip.".

	schema:headline " Great early talking depression film from King Vidor";
	schema:reviewBody "There is just one scene for the entirety of the film  the front of a brownstone tenement in New York City during the summer. However residents and visitors come and go making conversation and sometimes vicious gossip to pass the time on the steps of the building. This is not a film about people living in outright poverty. As a wholethey are one rung above being poor with the safer position of being outright middle class just out of reach. The drama and the conversation mainly revolves around the Maurrant family. Anna Maurrant has been having at least a close relationship and perhaps an affair with the married milkman. We never really see exactly what is going on between them. Anna's husband Frank a man who is basically angry at the whole world thinks that in the depression the fact that he holds down a job should make him husband of the year in the eyes of his wife and that his barking orders at her should be good enough conversation for her. The couple has a grown daughter Rose Sylvia Sidney whose married boss is leaning hard on her to let him become her sugar daddy and set her up in her own apartment. The couple also has a son who is well on his way to becoming a juvenile delinquent. Beulah Bondi really steals the show as a middleaged housewife who is the building's gossiperinchief. She doesn't have a kind word to say about anyone and thinks she knows how every household should be run. She doesn't seem to notice that her own Mama's boy son is a proficient bully and a journeyman gangster.Sam the son of a Jewish couple in the building is somewhat sweet on Rose as she is on him. Her father outright objects to any relationship based on his own prejudice. The Jewish couple has similar objections although they try to use the reason that any girlfriend will interfere with Sam's ambitions to become a lawyer.Then there is the woman and two children who are about to be evicted because the husband has run off and they cannot pay the rent. In one particular scene that is relevant to social attitudes towards the poor today a welfare worker shows up and chastises the woman when she learns that she has taken the children to the movies  she has spent a whopping 75 cents. When one of the neighbors mentions that he gave the woman some money because it made him feel good and made the woman feel good the welfare worker replies he shouldn't do that because it is bad for the woman's character.The whole thing builds slowly and artfully. Everyone knows something violent is going to happen here the question is who will be the perpetrator and who the victim. There are any number of disgruntled desperate and angry people with an ax to grind.The whole movie is just a very well done depression era sliceoflife film that shows that the residents may come and go but the situations for whatever occupants that live there will remain the same. They will remain people one paycheck away from poverty and possibly one revelation or argument away from violence. Highly recommended if you can find a copy.".

As lives intersect in front of the stoop we are presented a cross section of the great melting pot with accents and biases in place arguing politics dispensing philosophy bragging fueling stereotypes gossiping and complaining about the heat. In less skillful and ambitious hands Street Scene might have made for a more than passable filmed stage play by working in the confines of a studio sound stage but Vidor takes it to the streets in more than one scene giving the film a more gritty and realistic feel as well as using the expanse for symbolic purpose. He also eschews back projection by cleverly erecting a set off of an actual city street to provide realistic backdrop. His camera movement is breathtaking and powerful without being self indulgent as his signature crane shots unveil the neighborhood to establish time place and elevate drama. Working in a limited space he keeps things fresh and energized by changing angles and using natural transition by tracking characters into other conversations. His languorous but deliberate pace befitting a summer in the city heat wave that leads up to the stunningly edited climactic scene is perfectly measured for maximum effect. Max Steiner's score as well as the ambient music of children playing and singing in two separate scenes of dark irony seamlessly contribute to the films mood. While a general gloominess pervades and bigotries are ungoverned the stoop is the scene of great joy and humor much of it dark. The cast of various ethnic types run from comic to ugly as they freely spout superstitions bravado rumor bigotry and revolution. Some have dreams but most are filled with cynicism. Beulah Bondi as busy body Emma Jones is a sidewalk Cassandra with nothing good to say about anything or anyone. Sad eyed Sylvia Sidney gives a heartfelt performance as the daughter in the tragic Maurant family. Pulled from all sides she struggles to keep her family together while fending off the the seduction efforts of her boss who dangles a place of her own in front of her.Street Scene is a microcosm in part of the immigrant experience in America during the first half of the last century and though some of the characterizations may be broad it retains an important historical significance. But it is King Vidor's master class greatly assisted by the lensing of Barnes and Toland in cinema grammar that awes and makes Street Scene a superb work of the early sound era.".

The film is well directed by King Vidor and boasts a great score by Alfred Newman love that jazz music!. The action takes place on the stoop of a New York City tenement. Gossip swirls around one of the tenants who is having an affair. There is also lots of talks about foreigners and socialism and of course the heat. As the city swelters tensions rise and passions flare. Good story. Beaula Bondi takes acting honors as Mrs. Jones. She is so EVIL yet funny. Superb performance. Sylvia Sidney gets the first of her great tenement roles. William Collier Jr. plays the Jewish student. Silent film star Estelle Taylor is wonderful as the lonely woman. Taylor should have had a bigger talkie career. John Qualen plays the Swedish janitor. George Humbert is the Italian tenant. David Landau is good as the jealous husband. Ann Kostant Nora Cecil Richard Powell Matt McHugh Russell Hopton and Greta Granstedt are all good. Great camera work and sets..... A wonderful film.".

It's dated occasionally clumsy but unforgettable. Street Scene's microcosm is a brownstone in a Manhattan tenement block during a scorching heat wave.

Interestingly it was Nancy Carroll who was originally announced for the role of Rose Maurant in Street Scene. Why she didn't do it I don't know but Sylvia Sidney was excellent in the part.From the now familiar music of Alfred Newman the camera pans over the New York skyline and starts to follow Beulah Bondi down the street in a typical tenement. Emma Jones Beulah Bondi is the street's vicious gossip and she has plenty to gossip about. She is so busy causing trouble but her own son Matt McHugh is a thug and a bully. Mrs Maurant Estelle Taylor is having an affair with a married man Russell Hopton. The whole street seems to know except her husband David Landau and he certainly has his suspicions. She is just looking for kind words and gentleness  she believes in being a good neighbour and she has been a great help to one of the neighbours who is having a baby.Daughter Rose Sylvia Sidney is also becoming involved with her boss Walter Miller. He is married but wants to set her up in an apartment  he also wants her to go on the stage. Rose is attracted to Sam Kaplan William Collier Jnr. who yearns for a better way of life. When Frank Maurant comes home early from a sales trip and shoots his wife and her lover  the whole street is galvanized in a panic. It is an extraordinary sequence under King Vidor's masterful direction.It is a wonderful film that doesn't feel like a play at all. There are lots of different characters  the jovial Italian with ice creams for everyone the worried father to be the socialist the young girl on a spree with her young man but holding it all together is the incredible Beulah Bondi  you cannot take your eyes from her.Highly Recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "The blistering heat and unrelenting humidity of a hot summer day drive the tenants of a four story walkup out in front of the house where they sit on the stoop and gossip about one another with wanton relish.  Others hang out the window watching the cars drive by on the busy two way street while the occasional passing of the el can be heard coming down the tracks at the end of the block.The most vicious of the gossips is played by Beulah Bondi a hag of a woman who looks much older than her years.  Her favorite target is the very lonely and very stunning Mrs. Maurrant wonderfully played by Estelle Taylor who is constantly bullied by her husband played by David Landau. Mrs. Maurrant is so lovely she looks more like an older sister to Rose portrayed nicely by Sylvia Sidney instead of her mother.

At least a gun can shoot a person dead in a moment but cruel and relentless gossip cuts at the heart and soul without mercy.  Mrs. Maurrant is chided ridiculed humiliated and made fun of at every turn while she bravely tries to be friendly and understanding to everyone else.

	onyx:emotionText "The blistering heat and unrelenting humidity of a hot summer day drive the tenants of a four story walkup out in front of the house where they sit on the stoop and gossip about one another with wanton relish.  Others hang out the window watching the cars drive by on the busy two way street while the occasional passing of the el can be heard coming down the tracks at the end of the block.The most vicious of the gossips is played by Beulah Bondi a hag of a woman who looks much older than her years.  Her favorite target is the very lonely and very stunning Mrs. Maurrant wonderfully played by Estelle Taylor who is constantly bullied by her husband played by David Landau. Mrs. Maurrant is so lovely she looks more like an older sister to Rose portrayed nicely by Sylvia Sidney instead of her mother.  Mrs. Maurrant is so desperate for some kindness and attention that her fondness for the milkman is easily discerned by her jackallike neighbors.

Instead of a colorful Village apartment it's a Lower East Side tenement which today would be filled with Yuppies. But back in the Twenties when it was written you have Elmer Rice's Pulitzer Prize winning Street Scene.Street Scene ran a very nice 601 performances on Broadway and two members of the original cast came over for the film. John Qualen and Beulah Bondi playing Mr.Mrs. Olsen. They reminded me so much of the Kravitzes from Bewitched Mr. Kravitz who just wanted to relax and read his paper and Mrs. Kravitz forever in everyone else's business mostly the Stevenses. Bondi was a much nastier character still kind of funny that her own life is so empty that all she takes pleasure in is dishing the dirt about others.The main action centers around Sylvia Sydney who with this film and Dead End established herself as Hollywood's favorite slum daughter. She's the pretty girl in the building who gets everyone's hormones in overdrive. Her lummox of a father David Landau feels trapped by middle age and a life of no special significance. So does her mother Estelle Taylor. Thanks to Bondi everyone knows about her carrying on with the milkman except her children and husband. When Landau finds out there's tragedy coming up like an oil gusher.The only other significant character is William Collier Jr. a quiet and studious kid who just wants out of the slum. He's Jewish and Sylvia is Irish. Despite that Collier is the only one that Sylvia really responds to even though others push him around and make fun of him.Street Scene is not your melting pot slum of the East Side Kids who are from many backgrounds. Elmer Rice has a most politically incorrect work where everyone even casually refers to each other with all the ethnic slurs going. It's probably why Street Scene is not revived that often.Yet I'm glad the film isn't lost it should be preserved and seen as a guide to American attitudes back when it was made.".

	schema:reviewBody "Street Scene 1931  12 out of 4Hardhitting drama set in a Bronx tenement building. We are introduced to various groups of people who live at the apartment or are just visiting and soon a vicious rumor is going to have deadly consequences. The film centers on a young woman named Rose Sylvia Sidney who is being pursued by a married man while another poor one also loves her. Even more damning is that there's a rumor her mother is having an affair with a milk man. Producer Samuel Goldwyn and director Vidor do a terrific job at bringing Elmer Rice's stage play to the big screen. Even though the budget is obviously incredibly low that doesn't stop the great acting directing and the terrific music score by Alfred Newman. The film runs a very fast paced 80minutes and most of the action is simply dialogue with characters standing in front of their building. The stoop is pretty much the main location as that's where the people are constantly talking and the dialogue is so well written that you can't help but feel as if you're really standing there listening to folks talk. There's a very natural tone to the dialogue that also comes across in the directing and it really does seem as if you're watching a documentary on real people. Vidor does an excellent job at the start of the film where he puts us into the action by showing various objects suffering from the heat. The heat plays a major part in the film and thanks to this prologue we're really put right in the middle of it. The performances by the entire cast are wonderful but it's Sidney who really steals the film with her incredible work. I was really shocked to see how excellent she was her because of how natural she came off. You can just look at her and see her thinking and feeling at every turn her character goes through and this really helps one stay involved in the movie. Walter Miller Estelle Taylor Beulah Bondi William Collier Jr. David Landau Matt McHugh and Russell Hopton all deserve being mentioned for their fine work as well. It seems this film never gets mentioned that much any more and that's real shame because this is a nearly flawless production that deserves to be more known.".

Here as Rose Maurant she's the ensemble film's heart and soul struggling to survive urban poverty while others succumb. I like the way she's made no saint when she's definitely tempted to become her boss's kept woman. After all that's one way of escaping and in comfort too. Note also that Sidney's the only performer not to overact in the style of the day. That way her role remains surprisingly contemporary.There's no real plot just a succession of colorful characters commenting on one another. After all the single set is a tenement building that looks out on a New York street scene. It's a crosssection of ethnic types crowded together and I like that brief squabble over which ethnicity Scandinavian or Italian discovered America. At the same time there's no real privacy from neighbors beyond pulling down the outside shade. Gossip thrives to say the least Mrs. Jones but so does community the birth of the baby. In short the street scene remains very much a human scene. Amazing how director Vidor keeps a single set from becoming visually boring mainly by keeping at least somebody moving all the time. All in all the movie dissolves into a series of vignettes that nevertheless do reach a dramatic climax. Sure the film is dated in many ways not least of which is that often exaggerated acting style. Nonetheless the soulful Sidney remains fresh as ever her Rose a true blossom of yearning beyond the surrounding decay.".

The rest of the excellent cast includes David Landau Estelle Taylor and John Qualen also his film debut. It was based on a play which is fairly obvious when viewing.

The set is amazing especially when the camera pans out and you see how much work they put into making it authentic. About as good as it gets as far as movies of this type go.

There's the Jewish family the Kaplans  the father a loud Bolshevik the son a quiet student who is in love with Sidney and the understanding and compassionate mother.There's the Italian family with the fat goodnatured father wearing a mustache out of a barber shop quartet singing La Donna E Mobile and complaining that his wife refuses to get pregnant. There's an Irishman fond of drink and a reserved family of Scandinavians. At various times AfricanAmericans show up as well as Asians.Offensive words like Kike and Yid are sometimes used but they're used by the cocky street tough whom everyone dislikes. And we should probably keep in mind that the world was considerably less sensitive to such usage at the time pre politically correct.Although it's an ensemble movie it depends a lot on Sylvia Sidney the central character and she delivers.It had a curious effect on me. It impressed on me how much children have changed over the years. Here  quite realistically  they dance circles in the street and chant songs I can barely remember from my own childhood. The only reason kids don't play marbles is that there is no unpaved surface to dig a hole in. And girls don't skip rope anymore do they? I'd thought it was one of the eternal verities.".

Because of this by the time the film ends you may well be left feeling a bit let down because there is no satisfying conclusion. Much of the stuff that occurs is pretty limp though it certainly jumps into overdrive when there is a murder late in the film. Part of this is the excitement which is really needed and part is because for the first time the set opens up and you can see the neighborhoodwhich is something considering it was actually all filmed in California! But the crane shots and look of the set really make it seem realeven if the dialog often seems pretty fake. Overall an interesting film and a movie that tries it doesn't succeed but it tries to create a historical look at New York City circa 1930.If you do watch a few things to look for are some film debuts Beulah Bondi and John Qualen the smart aleck cop and the frequent use of derisive terms for the Jewish character.".

Overall an interesting film and a movie that tries it doesn't succeed but it tries to create a historical look at New York City circa 1930.If you do watch a few things to look for are some film debuts Beulah Bondi and John Qualen the smart aleck cop and the frequent use of derisive terms for the Jewish character.";

Every time Bondi's Mrs. Jones makes an appearance you almost want to hiss. While she played more sympathetic motherly types Bondi could also turn the tables and play the type of hypocrites which she plays here and as hateful as she is Bondi's performance is excellent. Much of the first half hour focuses on her complaining with various neighbors over the summer heat and how it brings out the worst in people making it almost funny in the sense that she doesn't see the truth about herself and is basically pointing back at her every time she opens her mouth. The setup for the drama which concludes this film is a series of reallife analyzations of how people interact showing little moments of pretty much everybody who lives in the building and others around the neighborhood who are tied together like characters out of a reallife soap opera.Sylvia Sidney makes her entrance half an hour in as the hardworking daughter of both Taylor and Landau whose actions are controlled by her father whom you can tell is on the verge of snapping. Brilliantly written by Elmer Rice the playwright who adapted his play for the screen this starts off memorably with the famous Alfred Newman music showing the audience a view of the neighborhood where these poor unfortunates live. Mixed with On the Sidewalks of New York Street Scene's musical theme gives an almost operatic feeling towards the story ironically musicalized years later for Broadway which was a critical hit if not a box office smash. Still timely more than 80 years later all you have to do is read the Daily News or New York Post to see that nothing has changed but the date and technology and society still hasn't learned the evils of gossip and the love of dirt and nobody even cares if it is or isn't true.".

	schema:headline " Score for Asylum";
	schema:reviewBody "For their credit this is one of their more competent pieces of trash and that's because there's considerably good gore and an interesting take on ripping off Snakes on a Plane. But if there's any more of example of the inconsistency behind Asylum's newest ripoff it's the two characters at the beginning whom are illegal immigrants and can't understand nor speak English to a Texas man sneaking them across the border yet when they get on a train and meet a friend they begin understanding and speaking perfect English.Aside from being a pretty bad depiction of a Hollywood formula Snakes on a Train is utterly boring. At least with Snakes on a Plane we were given the chance to watch actors wax comedic and attempt to be remotely interesting. The Mallachi Brothers installment features some of the most boring characters I've ever seen from an electrical engineer gee I wonder how he comes in handy later on to some stoner surfers right down to our two main characters attempting to fight off the snake curse that lurks in the husband's wife.Snakes is never entertaining and even when it's very gory it's still never as good as it has the chance to be because Snakes could have been a funny short film and instead just takes itself much too seriously and never camps it up at any moment. Instead of taking their small budget and making original films that can set a precedent they instead force their small budget to work against them in these knock offs. While the Mallachi brothers seem to be trying the train just looks incredibly artificial.It seems almost like a stage play with these inconsistent and awfully bland set pieces that try desperately to look like actual train cars while every so often it shakes the background of the windows are blurred and the sound effects go off every now and then to let us know they're actually on a train not to mention that in such a large extended train there only seems to be about ten passengers on it. And beyond the train fight and a drawn out sex scene we're forced to be subjected to a plot that makes zero sense. And not even the directors can work around the fact that the lethal snakes that go on this train look far from venomous or dangerous.The rest of the film staggers onto only about a minute of snake carnage and a bad subplot of an ex drug agent trying to molest a passenger. All of this dull exposition ends with a really ridiculous climax in which a poorly computer generated snake I saw better animation on the Super Nintendo completely swallows the train whole and is then dispensed in a method that should have been exercised from the very beginning. Asylum scores again.Asylum scores yet again with a hackneyed lazy horribly directed and boring ripoff of another better film. Snakes on a Train takes itself way too seriously and that's why it's never entertaining or memorable.".

	onyx:emotionText "For their credit this is one of their more competent pieces of trash and that's because there's considerably good gore and an interesting take on ripping off Snakes on a Plane. But if there's any more of example of the inconsistency behind Asylum's newest ripoff it's the two characters at the beginning whom are illegal immigrants and can't understand nor speak English to a Texas man sneaking them across the border yet when they get on a train and meet a friend they begin understanding and speaking perfect English.Aside from being a pretty bad depiction of a Hollywood formula Snakes on a Train is utterly boring. At least with Snakes on a Plane we were given the chance to watch actors wax comedic and attempt to be remotely interesting. The Mallachi Brothers installment features some of the most boring characters I've ever seen from an electrical engineer gee I wonder how he comes in handy later on to some stoner surfers right down to our two main characters attempting to fight off the snake curse that lurks in the husband's wife.Snakes is never entertaining and even when it's very gory it's still never as good as it has the chance to be because Snakes could have been a funny short film and instead just takes itself much too seriously and never camps it up at any moment. Instead of taking their small budget and making original films that can set a precedent they instead force their small budget to work against them in these knock offs. While the Mallachi brothers seem to be trying the train just looks incredibly artificial.It seems almost like a stage play with these inconsistent and awfully bland set pieces that try desperately to look like actual train cars while every so often it shakes the background of the windows are blurred and the sound effects go off every now and then to let us know they're actually on a train not to mention that in such a large extended train there only seems to be about ten passengers on it. And beyond the train fight and a drawn out sex scene we're forced to be subjected to a plot that makes zero sense. And not even the directors can work around the fact that the lethal snakes that go on this train look far from venomous or dangerous.The rest of the film staggers onto only about a minute of snake carnage and a bad subplot of an ex drug agent trying to molest a passenger.

	schema:headline " it barely qualifies as a guilty pleasure mostly for its climax";
	schema:reviewBody "I would probably want to give this movie a zero if not for the climax which involves not really Snakes on a Train but rather Train IN a Snake. The premise was cooked up far more than likely over the course of a night of beers after hearing about Snakes on a Plane in production this in fact was released to coincide with that film's release. The joke is probably not lost on those who will seek this out I don't think there would be a soul out there who would consider this anything as a serious actionthriller effort unless on an ironic level beyond the capacity for rational thought. It's about a Mayan curse placed on a woman who's damned by her family for leaving with another man and is soon seen sickened and coughing up green slime laced with of course snakes. She and her beau go on a train headed for Los Angeles and very soon after the morethanclich characters are privy to snakes overtaking the train with the originator woman becoming a snake herself. If it would be worth listing more about the movie I would but there isn't enough time during the day. All that can be said for the quality factor is that it's almost onexistent there are student short films with larger budgets. Maybe that was a wise calculation on the filmmakers' end that there would be so many copies sold just for the joke factor alone that they would recoup their budget in the first weekend. Because by looking at the sets the trains themselves change randomly in the middle of a scene! the actors if you can call them that with only one other actor the one with the very thin hair who hits on the one woman throughout the movie who benefited from the flick being produced the FX also next to nonexistent making the effects in Snakes on a Plane seem like Star Wars and the actual CGI snakes themselves with the final huge behemoth snake something to behold in scifi movie channel terms.This all means basically that it is a laugh riot every step of the way especially as cruel as it sounds when a little girl becomes involved in a snake's attention with the very disregard for good taste working well in its favor. This being said it is also 100 disposable like a Bmovie sourflavor lollipop.".

	schema:reviewBody "Forget everything that you have ever read about the Mallachi Brothers' straighttovideo release Snakes on a Train especially if it was a negative review. This movie is way more fun than the movie that it obviously rips off Snakes on a Plane. Frankly I am surprised that more people aren't rhapsodizing about this lowbudget Asylum Release. Instead most reviews that I've read have nothing kind or critically worthwhile to say except the usual stupid herd mentality idiocy such as the acting was amateurish the action didn't numerically live up to the advertising and the entire thing amounted to a hideous waste of time. Of course it doesn't help that the title is a tipoff to the obvious ripoff nature of this film. Actually I felt that Snakes on a Train surpassed Snakes on a Plane for a number of reasons.First the producers used real genuine snakes until the last fifteen minutes when they substituted either giant fake snake heads or computer generated a supergiant snake that consumed an entire Amtrak like train. How many movies have a snake gobble a train? As a result Snakes on a Train ranks as the first movie to scale that height.Second this lowbudget movie employs some grisly grossout effects. The woman who coughs up baby snakesreal oneswas fantastic! The special effects of her forearms getting tore up later in the movie were visually enticing! Also you get to see a little white girl get eaten alive by a snake. She was as cute as she could be no more than 10 years old or thereabouts and she died screaming all the way as nasty ol giant mister snake head swallows her. Not only kids in jeopardy but kid eaten! This is exactly the kind of graphic material that you won't find in 99  of all theatrical Hollywood releases. Of course she wasn't eaten by a real snake but it's the subversive thought that counts.Third it is one of those cursed upon movies where Alma Julia Ruiz of That Guy the chief female characterno heroinehas a curse placed on her by her parents because she didn't marry the man that they recommended. As a result she is filled with snakes coughs up quantities of green radiator fluid slop then chucks up a baby snake. Imagine Medusa the mythical characters that had snakes for hair only with the snakes in her belly. Her psychoshaman type boyfriend collects all the snakes that come out of her because they are heading to L.A. on a train to see a relative of his who can put all the snakes back inside of her and return her to normal. Talk about a whacked out character performing stomach churning routines. Prepare yourself for lots of slime blood and gore. Fourth the train had only about twenty or so passengers not hundreds. Nevertheless it looked like the Mallachi Brothers filmed this aboveaverage horror flick onboard a real train with real snakes and they played up the swaying motion of the train on the tracks.Fifth the snakes slither around for the first hour quietly infiltrating the train before they turn weird and attack everybody. In other words it's suspense suspense suspense before people start dying from snake bites.Up until the last five minutes when the snake grows bigger than the runaway train and swallows it Snakes on a Train is warped wonderful and wayout. It doesn't have the Attention Deficit editing of a big league Hollywood movie. It's a fantasy about an unfortunate Hispanic women victimized because of her feminist atoddswithsociety attitude. Altogether you've got gory fantasy type stuff suspenseful snakes slithering around the train and am overthetop gigantic snake at the end. Incidentally they get on board the train because a bunch of other Mexicans have bribed a train employee and the Mexicans on board think that the girl is so cute that they let her and her boyfriend on free.I think it's better than Snakes on a Plane if you want a tough little independently produced horror movie.".

Basically some woman has a Mayan curse where she pukes up harmless harmless garter snakes that instead of attacking crawl inside of they're victims. The girl with the bag of coke is pretty hot. On the title screen it says 100 Passengers... 3000 Venemous Vipers! Scary I know. There weren't even 100 passengers on the train. Only a couple of stoners and some other washed out losers. It's worth the five bucks to see the woman turn into a huge CG snake and devour the whole train then get sucked into a huge vortex though. It's just sad that someone would go to such lengths to make a crap film only to make a few bucks because of the Snakes on a Plane craze.".

If they had a better budget and some actors that knew what they were doing this film could have been really good. I like movies about snakes and there has not been any good ones since those ones that were made in the 1970's so what we really need is a good one. Lets hope that Snakes on a Plane will be better.".

The fact that I actually predicted that the jello puking snake girl would actually TRANSFORM into a snake about half way through terrifies me...Anyways the movie is great to make fun of but you have to make sure there's at least 4 of you and you're all spitting out jokes in rapid fire because if there's even 1 second of watching this movie where you're not laughing your ass off you will feel physically ill.

And not for a single moment did I believe that the movie was actually taking place on a locomotive train. Not even once did you get to look outside the windows in the train to see the passing by landscape and scenery. All windows were oddly enough semiglossy and nontransparent.This movie is one to stay clear off and it was a test of will to sit through this and keep watching it.

Okay maybe that's not exactly what I said but you get the point. I didn't need to know who was in the movie or anything else. All I knew was that I am renting this movie.I probably should have asked what it was about though. In retrospect I don't know if I would have really wanted to watch a movie about a Mayan curse that causes a woman to give internal birth to snakes and have them spit out of her mouth. Nor would I want to see a movie that features a guy who looks strangely enough like a pedophilic version of Leif Garrett.Anyways while the curse might be interesting on some levels well maybe not there was still promise of these annoying characters getting eaten or at the very least killed by snakes. So I was willing to sit through the first hour of very little happening other than a Texas Ranger forcing a girl into a nice little titty grope so she can keep her cocaine or the Hispanic shaman that likes to occasionally stab people. But then all hell broke loose and the girl started to spit out more and more snakes.SPOILER ALERT So everything's going well at the end and I'm willing to overlook the fact that some of these snakes all of the sudden turned out to be 25 feet long. After all people are getting eaten so it's all good. But then all of the sudden and I'm not going to tell you how because that would ruin the best part one of the snakes is about 300 feet long. Then it proceeds to squeeze and devour the train with all the graphic artistry of Serpentaur from the old GI Joe cartoons. Unfortunately I could not make a Nemesis Enforcer connection with this movie. Anyways so you would think that a snake that big who ate a train would be pretty unstoppable. Well not if you know your Mayan voodoo rocks and have the ability to summon tornadoes from heaven. Yeah that's all I'll say about that.In short this movie is bad. Really bad to the point where you might be numb after watching this or your brain might hurt. I didn't give this a one because no matter how stupid it was it still wasn't as bad as Date Movie. So if you like camp or badly constructed B horror movies this is the one for you. If you think this will actually be cool like its bigger more infamous brethren just walk away from the box if you see it. And I'll leave you with a quote from the movie that should basically sum it all up.Snakes can't get on a train! Because that's just silly. Not like they make stops or anything....".

The biggest factor for here is the fact that this one goes big for the contents of the curse that it becomes enjoyable in how it builds in here going from genuinely creepy to actually cheesy throughout. The opening scenes in the baggage car where the birth occurs by vomiting out the snakes that begins all the fun of the rest of this one by giving off these types of encounters throughout here as the concept of these scenes is certainly cheesy enough but carried out in a serious thrilling feeling with all the action here not only to keep the snakes contained but there's the enjoyable fun of the snakes getting loose. These here are the film's best points as the spreading snakes either through possession or the freed creatures in the cars slithering along the floors into passengers' compartments and the bathrooms results in plenty of exciting cheesy action swarming over victims shootouts and plenty of vomiting up snakes to give this section all sorts of fun. As well the film gets quite a bit out of the concept of the voodoo curse here which carries this one along throughout here which is enjoyable enough but not to hold off the flaws here. The biggest issue here is how long it takes for the actual carnage to begin which comes from several big factors contributing together. Among the biggest here is the central purpose of the curse seeing as how this one has it to where the main point of the victims is to keep the snakes from getting loose and manage to spend most of the film trying to do so. Other factors in the plot line from the girl smuggling drugs the fake policeman among the crowd as well as the family drama all manage to really hold off the first half here leaving only the last ten minutes for any kind of good snake action. These keep that plodding along Since they're not loose among the train and nothing of interest happens or very little of it is enjoyable in this section of the film. As well the other flaw with this one is the CGI snakes which look really bad and obvious about not being in contact with their surroundings don't react to anything around them or that obvious pixilation that gives away the origins of the creature. Along with a badlyedited foreignlanguage opening that's massively confusing these here are what hold this one down against the positives.Rated R Graphic Violence Graphic Language Nudity and childrenin jeopardy.".

A coursed girl and a boy try to smuggle themselves into los statos unidos by train until she transforms in a huge viper and swallow the train What?!. Basically nothing happens for the first hour of the movie. The director tries to introduce other characters and their stories but they're so shallow and bad that you won't even care about 'em. The only thing worth a mention that happens in the first 60 mins is the main character that rips another guy's heart using the Indiana Jones' evil thuggee lord's style. And that's it. Finally when the clock strikes the end of the 60st minute something happens BOOBS. Really. Not that I don't like see topless girls but hey you're shooting a movie that sks and you want to rise it up a little by showing us boobs? OK I appreciate that but at least do it with a girl with nice round and big ones no offense Amelia. After that several snakes get unleashed they start to attack people and the controls of the train break so nobody can stop it to get away from the snakes. I don't even wanna talk about the cgi used in the last scene. It's not worth it. What I liked about this movie which is what saves it from a 1 out of 10 is that the producers didn't care at all about showing breasts for no reason and having a child swallowed hole by a giant python. Good splatter effects as well in the carved heart scene and in the armpenetrating snakes one. Don't watch it. It's so bad that it's not even funny.".

This movie does however have some issues.First as the movie opens and we are introduced to Alma and her beau they are walking through the desert speaking to each other. The problem is they are speaking to each other in Spanish. Would it have killed the good people at The Asylum to through up a few subtitles or do they just take for granted that the dialogue in their films is typically meaningless so why bother? Second problem with this movie is the directors' blatant disregard for plot holes. When Alma tries to initially stowaway on the train and only has pesos it's pretty convenient that a childhood friend just happens to be on that exact train in that exact car at that exact time to pay her way in U.S. dollars. Question How do the two Mexican guys get out of the cage unnoticed when Alma and her boyfriend are literally only a few feet away from them at all times? Another question how does the blondehaired drug smuggling young lady NOT know she had been bitten by a snake? These characters would never been found at your local chapter of Mensa. They are stupid to the point of being special. You cringe when the electrical engineer asks Do you know what time it is? when he is very obviously wearing a watch that if it were any larger it would be Big Ben. Also does it ever occur to Alma and her boyfriend that because she is very sick from the curse it would make more sense to simply call the Uncle living in L.A. and ask him to come to them instead of making a perilous trek across the country that would put at risk the lives of several other people? Just a final note to the two Directors and The Asylum Was it absolutely necessary to cast the Middle Eastern Actor as the sinister looking passenger? The choice borders on clich' and cultural insensitivity. And finally...IT IS NEVER A GOOD IDEA TO KILL A CHILD IN A MOVIE.".

The cast was made up of popular New York actors of the period most of whom are today forgotten. The play was first adapted to the screen in 1925 and starred the Dutchact comedy team of Lew Webber and Joe Fields. And therein lies the problem of this faithfultotheperiod talkie remake. Cast as two German patriarchs now ensconced in America are Charles Winninger and Charles Ruggles. Both Charlies were very fine actors with great comic timing. But for some reason director Allan Dwan had them emulate Webber  Fields' vaudevillestyle Dutch accents rather than use more realistic dialects. He would have been better off using authentic GermanAmerican actors. Felix Bressart and Jean Hersholt would have been perfect. Ilka Gruning who plays Winninger's wife was Austrian and her authentic dialect was perfect. Much of the power of the dialogue was lost to distraction in the leading players' exaggerated accents. As always Otto Kruger is very fine as the villain in the piece understated and chillingly threatening. As with all Edward Small pictures of this period the production values are firstrate. And as with most Edward Small pictures of this period FRIENDLY ENEMIES is very difficult to see. Keep an eye out for it. It remains a timely and thoughtful story.".

At any rate it is so pleasant to see a film with no beastly violence and trash talk which are routine in current movies. Of course for us happy people Gene Tierney's fans the main recommendation for China Girl is the presence of our Goddess of Love and Beauty. Beyond her incomparable beauty and loveliness Gene shows her usual underrated talent as an actress with her sad dreaming eyes her rare sweet smiles her refusal to give way to love even her bravery in sharing her unhappy people's sufferences she instills in the audience the foreboding of her bitter fate.".

I agree with the above reviewer on some of its shortcomings but would also point out that there is a very nice tension set up between Gene Tierney and Lynn Bari throughout most of the story  which certainly had me watch it through to the very end. Contrary to other opinions Tierney fans will not be disappointed here although I agree she doesn't truly shine as in some others and Lynn Bari is at her best and definitely makes us wish she had been given more prominent parts. Some feel that Bari actually makes this movie but this may be going too far. Moreover I don't believe China Girl was ever intended as a war movie per se rather a drama. The warscene ending just happens to be the bitter twist that closes what is essentially a wartime drama between a guy and two gals  it's no more complex than that.Also the camera is no slouch either in this movie. It has excellent shots in the hotel rooms where much of the action takes place giving it a somewhat noir feel that definitely generates an overall stylish period polish that is in synch with the true noirs of the period. If you like this style as I do China Girl is worth seeking out. One can only hope that it will eventually become part of a Tierny Collection. I'm certainly keeping my fingers crossed!".

Then there's the scene where hero George Montgomery and Victor McLaglen crawl through a ditch of dead Chinese. As if 1942 audiences didn't hate the Japanese enough in the year since Pearl Harbor... The problem with China Girl is the Ben Hecht I can't believe it's possible to complain about Hecht script based on an idea prodded out of the prolific ghostpen of Darryl F. Zanuck. Montgomery plays a fauxClark Gableish newsreel cameraman suspected of being a spy who in the midst of his escape snatches some intelligence seemingly vital to the Japanese. Now unfortunately you can forget all that. It becomes a love story as Montgomery woos exotic but not very Chinese looking Gene Tierney. Except that McLaglen and his confederate moll Lynn Bari who also has the hots for George have their own agenda. Except you can forget all about that too. The plot goes nowhere and serves as an excuse to show further Japanese atrocities against Chinese children. No spoilers here... it's just that the movie feels pointless plotwise. Tierney was the hottest actress at 20th Century Fox from '4144... her acting ability was respectably serviceable best when playing a cold bitch from hell but few ever melted a camera the way she did. I was astonished how Montgomery moved around on credit I think he still owed stereotypicalyetnow unP.C. Bobby Blake at least 450 in reality the kid probably would have cut him. The best part of China Girl is the set design the worst part is how it manipulates the audience. Where'd the plot go?".

I guess that's true if you don't mind what the Japanese are called and Chinese bodies tossed into a trench as our hero escapes imprisonment. Or the bombing of the very authenticlooking school and village including the terror and apparent death of trusting little kids who weren't evacuated to a safer place very much like in the 1937 movie The Hurricane. I found those things realistic and repulsive.Why Montgomery had to do a Clark Gable impression is beyond me and it makes his acting hard to endure. I gather from movie dramas that China was full of Americans and Brits as missionaries and business people when the Japanese invaded. Apparently you could hardly swing a cat without hitting one or two.  I found Tierney's character uninteresting compared to Bari's and I was unmoved by what happened to her at the end with the obligatory inspirational speech complete with heavenly rays of light. I could see why the rough and ready but perennially wellshaved and clothed photographer from Akron would be fascinated by a beautiful and aloof Vassar girl who was half Chinese instead of all the dames who were throwing themselves at him but I wasn't. She seemed a false note in the village scenes and she never made me care about her. Actually I just cared about the Chinese in the village because we know what they would have to endure in the years to come if they survived to maturity.There are lots of good lines and moments which make this watchable. It's interesting to me to see the changing view of the war in movies as the situation on the ground changed. In the late 30s movies indicated that this war was just a reprise of the last one with greedy and powerful men manipulating behind the scenes and international alliances bringing the situation to a head although there was no consensus on which countries would be fighting which even France vs Britain was considered plausible! Then it was a British war with peripheral Americans. And then it was an American war with us in the thick of things against obvious villains and no reference to the time when it was seen as just another European land grab and whatever happened in China etc was very remote indeed.".

Johnny is helpless trying to save the woman he loved.Coming from a writer like Ben Hecht the film is somewhat disappointing. Not even Henry Hathaway a good director was able to make this movie work. The trouble is the way the main characters are conceived. Johnny Williams romance with Haoli doesn't ring true. After only one day he is madly in love with this woman ready to do anything to keep her forever. Then there is Fifi who sees right through Johnny and ends up wanting to have him. It might have worked in the 1940s but it feels false today. We are not trying to demean what the creators tried to give the public but much of the story makes no sense.The fun comes in watching George Montgomery's take on Johnny. He was an action hero whose work in films gave him opportunities to display a charming personality. Gene Tierney on the other hand seems wooden in her approach to Haoli. She was a lovely woman with a screen presence to match. Lynn Bari who appears as Fifi fares better. Her Fifi is a dubious character that feels real. Victor McLaglen as Weed has nothing to do. Robert Blake who was a child actor turns up as Chandu the little boy that is befriended by Johnny and acts as his personal accountant.Fans of Henry Hathaway and the stars will enjoy China Girl even if it is flawed.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm a big Gene Tierney fan so I tuned into this one with some eagerness hoping to see a film that captured preWWII tensions in SE Asia and gave the luscious actress some room to shine. And while Gene does have a few moments of brilliance the rest of the film is a mishmash of good and bad elements. The whole is somewhat less than satisfying.My biggest problem is that this film doesn't really know what it wants to be action movie spywar thriller romance drama or antiJapanese war propaganda. The script tries to be all things to all people and ends up satisfying no one. Plot elements are left hanging unresolved. One line of tough guy dialog is followed by another trying to stir hearts about the plight of the Chinese nationalists. What a mess! George Montgomery is a poor man's Clark Gable and he's almost a caricature in this film  tough guy only looking out for himself who falls hard for a dame caught up in the mess that was China and Burma in 1941. Though Tierney gets top billing it's really Montgomery's film and he's not up to carrying it. He's pretty good at the action stuff but he's lost in the romantic scenes. Plus his comedic timing is way off. It doesn't help him that the screenwriter gave him some terribly cheesy dialog.There is little depth to any of the supporting cast although Robert Blake gives a scenestealing performance as a young Burmese kid of all things that pals around with our hero in Mandalay.There are some good elements here  some exotic shots that appear to be on location if they're backlot they fooled me and a wonderful set in the hotel in Mandalay. The action scenes often move well. The movie doesn't pull punches either  we see Chinese civilians being mowed down by Japanese machine guns and our hero crawls across a ditch of dead bodies in an early escape scene. This is more grim than I expected from a film more than 60 years old and it's effectively done.But overall I can't recommend this film to hardly anyone. There are better films about Japanese brutality in SE Asia during WWII Bridge on the River Kwai or Objective Burma and certainly better films for Tierney fans my recs  Laura The Ghost and Mrs. Muir and Leave Her to Heaven. Give this one a pass and consign it to the history books.".

The action scenes often move well. The movie doesn't pull punches either  we see Chinese civilians being mowed down by Japanese machine guns and our hero crawls across a ditch of dead bodies in an early escape scene. This is more grim than I expected from a film more than 60 years old and it's effectively done.But overall I can't recommend this film to hardly anyone. There are better films about Japanese brutality in SE Asia during WWII Bridge on the River Kwai or Objective Burma and certainly better films for Tierney fans my recs  Laura The Ghost and Mrs. Muir and Leave Her to Heaven. Give this one a pass and consign it to the history books.";

When he gets to Mandalay he meets up with another beautiful woman named Haoli Young Gene Tierney and falls in love with her. Unfortunately events take on their own life and things don't go according to plan. At any rate rather than spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this is an average grade B war movie filmed during World War II. The acting was barely adequate and while Gene Tierney was attractive she was less than convincing as a halfChinese school teacher.

	schema:reviewBody "Director Rokuro Mochizuki started his career in the Japanese porno industry before making his name with some strikingly characteristic work in the 1990s a success contemporary with other industry colleagues such as Kiyoshi Kurosawa and Takashi Miike. Unlike these two however Mochizuki has made less of an impact in recent years and together with his Another Lonely Hitman 1995. Onibi  The Fire Within is probably his best  or at least judged so from those seen so far in the west. As is frequently common practice in the conservative Nipponese film industry where art house work is typically 'smuggled' to audiences in the guise of genre pieces Mochizuki often works within the yakuza film creating his own distinct style within the frequently considerably stretched boundaries of the gangster narrative. The 'fire within' of the title here refers to the flame of existence something akin to essential essence or the soul. At one point in the film there is reference to the ghost of a victim materialising next to the killer immediately after an assassination and hero Kunihiro affirms its existence. But it more specifically refers to the hero's special kind of strength recognised by those who befriend him upon his release You're just like a cultural asset says his new boss before Kunihiro's dry response and you want me to explode when necessary.After so many years in prison he has had to rely upon this inner spirit to survive a process that has become formalised through a love of classical music. He has also made the close acquaintance of Hideyuki Sakata and the suggestion is that their relationship at least while inside is more than that of close friends. Refusing a large amount of money to welcome him back to the gang immediately upon his release Kunihiro has problems settling in and there's a sense that he feels ill at ease with the gangsters of today. Instead of money from his new contacts Kunihiro unexpectedly asks for a camera through which he captures elements of his new environment as well as establishing his own presence and viewpoint within it. Initially unable to connect even on the most rudimentary physical level with the female piano player Asako the film sees Kunihiro seeking to reenter society though a series of what might be called meditative vignettes the success of which brings him closer to Asako and her plight. Just as in Another Lonely Hitman it takes a woman to draw the chief protagonist back into normal life and with similarly disastrous results. Similar to the earlier film too is the importance of photography. It is only when Asako asks the hitman to help kill a man who has nude photographs of her that his reassimilation begins in earnest to the point that he later breaks into her house to retrieve her photo albums which ironically she then refuses to look at. Some have seen the director's especial concern with cameras as a wider metaphor for his own interest in the nature of representation  Mochizuki was educated at Image Forum an experimental film academy  an interpretation born out perhaps by the final image of Kunhiro at the close the most artificial shot in the film.The Fire Within's source is from a story by a former lawyer of the Yamaguchi crime syndicate and presumably the original was based in brutal fact. Mochizuki brings a whole dimension of his own to the adaptation in an exploration of outward image and real identity. Critic Tom Mes for one has no doubt as to the success of the result calling Onibi the best Japanese film of the last 15 years  a judgement at which this viewer at least would hesitate. Mochizuki's film is an extremely subtle one  but it has to be said that its calm surface is rather like a mirror in which the more one stares in the hope of seeing the more is reflected back  opportunities for this activity existing aplenty due to the slow emphatic pacing throughout. Does Kunihiro distance himself from his fellow gangsters through an existential desire to be free for instance or is he simply stunned and still trying to readjust to the new set of operations after 27 years? Chief actor Yoshio Harada seen more recently in Azumi 2003 and the also excellent 9 Souls has had a long and distinguished film career. The depiction of Kunihiro was something of a change for him as previously he had cultivated a macho action image on screen a long haired whirling dervish of controlled passion and anger in such films as Fukusaku's Triple Cross and on that basis had amassed a large following. In the present film he excels in showing a great spirit in repose rather than action turning himself into a different kind of actor completely.The casual viewer will find the trancelike elements of this film either distancing or profound according to taste. Notable is a scene set in a swimming pool shot under difficult conditions during an E. Coli outbreak in Osaka where the camera spends long moments on the participants finding its own rhythm and pleasure though the play of elegant instrumentals. Mochizuki's use of music like this to bring out the inherent mood and raptness of scenes reminded this viewer of Kubrick's Barry Lyndon  a very different film indeed but one which also contained moments of stillness and poise where the score too hinted at emotions laying below calm exteriors. Another director who springs to mind closer to home is Takeshi Kitano. He similarly places moments of Zenlike calm in his gangster films including a fondness for water only to interrupt such placid moments with abrupt violence. If Mochizuki is not quite as memorable as Kitano his film is one which repays reviewing for the patient fan although those who seek their yakuza flicks with more upfront concerns will best advised to look elsewhere.".

	onyx:emotionText "Director Rokuro Mochizuki started his career in the Japanese porno industry before making his name with some strikingly characteristic work in the 1990s a success contemporary with other industry colleagues such as Kiyoshi Kurosawa and Takashi Miike. Unlike these two however Mochizuki has made less of an impact in recent years and together with his Another Lonely Hitman 1995. Onibi  The Fire Within is probably his best  or at least judged so from those seen so far in the west. As is frequently common practice in the conservative Nipponese film industry where art house work is typically 'smuggled' to audiences in the guise of genre pieces Mochizuki often works within the yakuza film creating his own distinct style within the frequently considerably stretched boundaries of the gangster narrative. The 'fire within' of the title here refers to the flame of existence something akin to essential essence or the soul. At one point in the film there is reference to the ghost of a victim materialising next to the killer immediately after an assassination and hero Kunihiro affirms its existence. But it more specifically refers to the hero's special kind of strength recognised by those who befriend him upon his release You're just like a cultural asset says his new boss before Kunihiro's dry response and you want me to explode when necessary.After so many years in prison he has had to rely upon this inner spirit to survive a process that has become formalised through a love of classical music. He has also made the close acquaintance of Hideyuki Sakata and the suggestion is that their relationship at least while inside is more than that of close friends. Refusing a large amount of money to welcome him back to the gang immediately upon his release Kunihiro has problems settling in and there's a sense that he feels ill at ease with the gangsters of today. Instead of money from his new contacts Kunihiro unexpectedly asks for a camera through which he captures elements of his new environment as well as establishing his own presence and viewpoint within it. Initially unable to connect even on the most rudimentary physical level with the female piano player Asako the film sees Kunihiro seeking to reenter society though a series of what might be called meditative vignettes the success of which brings him closer to Asako and her plight.

	schema:reviewBody "I haven't been thoroughly following David Mamet's career but just watching this film American Buffalo and Glengarry Glen Ross I already get a feel of his unique style of writing.  It's very witty very original and he has certain trademarks like quick exchanges of dialogue between actors and repeating of the same sentence of dialogue in a group of lines.  Well his uniqueness is quite evident in watching this movie and it works quite well.First I'll mention the vast array of talented actors.  I don't think the casting could've been any better.  Character actor William H. Macy is brilliant as the almost unscrupulous director who will do ANYTHINGand I'm not exaggerating the least bitto get his picture done.  Fellow character actorfellow PT Anderson regular Philip SeymourHoffman turns in another brilliant yet subtle performance as the shy but appealing and wildly creative screenwriter who is the fuel of this cinematic project.  As I said he's made a significantand extremely impressivetransition from playing the airhead jerk in Scent of a Woman and Twister to playing deep character roles like this.  He ranks among the top in my list of Best Underrated Actors along with Macy and I hope one of these days he'll become a household name.  David Peymer I think delivers the best performance of his career as the fasttalking sniveling producer.  I've always known he was a good actor but he truly flaunts his knack for acting and taking risks in this role.  It figures that playwright Mamet would assemble a group of fine character actors instead of simply casting people who look good on camera.  That's one of the advantages of having a playwright as a director.The script is wildly original and kept me laughing.  There are many interesting memorable quotes.  And this is just a fine adult comedy Thank God!!.  With the explosion of teen grossout comedies I'm sure audiences will cherish a comedy like this.  It works in all aspects.  Not only is it wellperformed but it's wellwritten lots of comedies only contain one of those factors.  And it's all done in good taste.  So those of you expecting cheap sex jokes and lowbrow gags involving bodily functionssorry to disappoint you!  There are no cliches.  This movie is an explosion of Mamet's gift for creativity.  Take for example the relationship between Hoffman and the beautiful Rebecca Pidgeon.  They don't have a sex scene. Most of their screen time is spent talking and getting to know each other sharing their thoughts on writing researching the town's history finding out how much they have in common.  Do we still see that in the movies? Character development in romance?  In the scene where Hoffman is in the hotel room with Sarah Jessica Parker lying on the bed naked and Pidgeon knocks on his door to greet him with a bouquet of flowers there's no predictability.  You would assume she would take one look at Parker's naked body and punch him in face.  I'm not going to give away what happens but that moment stuck in my mind because it is the first film I've seen to go a different route with the whole girlfriend catches you in bed with another girl premise.  State and Main is pleasant lighthearted funny original comedy and it's one I'd definitely recommend.  If you want to see great performances and laugh at good tasteful humoryou can't go wrong!My score  7 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "It's difficult to write an objective review about a film that I'm so enthusiastic about but there's no getting around it I haven't been this excited about a movie in a long time so I'll just forge ahead.  The film is State and Main' written and directed by David Mamet and arguably his best effort since 1987's House Of Games.'  When a movie company invades the sleepy hamlet of Waterford Vermont for a location shoot complete with big name stars Bob Barrenger Alec Baldwin and Claire Wellesley Sarah Jessica Parker in tow it creates quite a stir and before it's over many of the townsfolk as well as a few of those connected with the film have learned some things about themselves and others they never knew before.  Things about honesty purity and the moral flexibility inherent in many of those who reside here on planet Earth. As a setting for the making of the film within the film which is about purity and second chances Mamet takes a page right out of Americana complete with a Main Street an historic firehouse a quaint hostelry and even maybe' an old mill on a stream.  And in making a film about making a film about purity and second chances he's made a film about purity and well second chances a terrific character study that is forthright and sincere and which rings with truth from beginning to end.  It's as honest as it is real and so accessible that it makes an instant connection with the audience.  There are characters and situations here with which everyone will be able to identify in one way or another all presented refreshingly and quite unpredictably.  Just when you think you see something coming from a mile away you're treated to one of those famous Mamet twists' that take you exactly where you didn't think you were going.  And Mamet does it so well that it's not only highly entertaining but invigorating as well. The cast he put together for this film is superlative beginning with William H. Macy as Walt Price the director of the movie.  A Mamet regular Macy creates a character infused with that magic Mamet realism that helps establish the credibility of the film from the outset.  Baldwin is perfectly cast as the star' with certain insatiable appetites and recreational needs as is Parker as the actress with a sudden case of issues' regarding her contractual obligations.  And David Paymer does a solid turn as Marty Rossen the producer of the film.  But the two actors who really make this movie tick are the charismatic Rebecca Pidgeon and the versatile multitalented Philip Seymour Hoffman. Pidgeon is absolutely captivating as Ann Black the local who runs the book shop and directs the town's drama group which includes just about everybody in Waterford it seems.  She's winsome and charming with a directness and vigor that is stunning and she captures the very essence of Ann the intelligence and the compassion and conveys it convincingly to the audience.  It's a memorable performance and one of the strengths among many of the movie.  The real star of the show however is Hoffman as Joseph Turner White the writer of the movie.  He gives an introspective performance filled with nuance and subtlety that is so real so pure that he singlehandedly takes the film to a whole new level.  Like Meryl Streep Hoffman has that chameleonlike ability that enables him to be anyone and everyone yet always unique it's a quality with which few actors are endowed and he uses his gift to full advantage here with his memorable portrayal of White.  Simply put it's a great performance by a great actor and one that should earn him an Oscar nomination. The supporting cast includes Charles Durning Mayor George Bailey Clark Gregg Doug Patti LuPone Sherry Bailey Julia Stiles Carla and Ricky Jay Jack.  Mamet has a style that make his films uniquely his own and State and Main' is one of his best.  Exceptionally well done and delivered it's intelligent funny and entertaining an honest and succinct examination of human nature with an integrity at it's core that makes it a truly great film.  This is a prime example of what the magic of the movies is all about a film that absolutely should not be missed.  I rate this one 1010.".

But now Mamet turns to light comedy and succeeds even if as times it's a little too light. The film is mainly supported besides a clever script by it's cast including William H. Macy delivering some good laughs as a director who comes off like he did in Fargo only more like you would see a director. Phillip Seymour Hoffman makes good as a writer Alec Baldwin brings some sly humor as a big movie star who can't get away from 14 year old girls though Julia Stiles doesn't look 14 Sarah Jessica Parker is actually sexy here and David Paymer is stunningly funny as a go for broke producer.  At points one could compare this movie to the brilliant Bowfinger from last year and they might be right but Mamet also adds in stuff about small towns as well. Enjoyable to say the least.  B".

Clark Gregg on the town side does an underappreciated job of playing the jilted fianc and future corrupt politician.Contrasting this 10yearold film with nonsense like 500 Days of Summer you can see the difference between good light comedy and bad light comedy. Pidgeon and Hoffman at least hint at complexities of character that make their relationship an interesting prospect.".

There are dozens this year already by others and about writing too and this is an incredibly tight and multilayered edition but the layers are different than usual.Once again we get relatively deep ruminations on the nature of art. Here the mirror of film and filmwithin is reflected in Hollywood and a real' town. Lots of smaller reflections too  for instance in the external film breasts are shown to the lead but not the audience while this same issue is manipulated in the internal film. Lots of plot turns including some unconsummated starts who burned stuff down? why did it inspire the Huskies? what happened to 1975? Some truly great acting on the part of Hoffman and Macy. And the whole thing is funny as hell.But what's truly fascinating is how Mamet layered the meanings and how he placed his wife in the center. His past few films  the ones he directed plus Vanya'  were incredibly multilayered. He creates parallel worlds which the actors jump among sometimes chasing or annotating or fighting. Very rich very jazz. But in the last two films Rebecca has been lost as an actress. She's really quite accomplished but as a straight ahead sort of actor. Hoffman can play several roles at once  Pidgeon only one.One can see that Mamet loves his levels  it's the core of his achievement. But he loves his wife more. So here he has flattened his levels of abstraction so that they are not indirectly referenced but intrinsic in the story. That way his wife can work with her role without being swamped. He even builds the entire creation of both films around her she writes them both. And he adds a halffilm of sorts where she creates her own by mobilizing townspeople to fool Hoffman's character. More. With Hoffman as his surrogate he even makes the story about this bending of the story for her about sacrificing artifice for love. What a valentine! How enobling a love! I'll bet his next writingdirecting effort The Heist' now in production is similarly built on her.My only complaint continues to be his use of the camera which is strictly mundane. His films are plays all about the writing and acting not at all about the filming in the filming. What will happen when Mamet's writing is seen through Ridley Scott's eye? We'll soon see.".

	schema:reviewBody "The reviews of this film seem to be mixed and I am confused on how that can be?  This is one of my favorite movies ever and may be the best not slapstick Chris Farleyesque comedy but smart comedy.  You must pay attention to this movie to get the jokes because most of them are running as in recurring jokes that pick up on items that may have been just mentioned once Go you Huskies! and again and again and again and then are explained later as a tagon in the dialogue.  This basic comedy technique works on an early Mel Brooks type level and makes for a movie that should be watched many times in order to pick up everything but is still maybe even more enjoyable after each viewing.The writing is unquestionably the best comedy screenplay since those early Brooks films.  It's just funny but you have to pay attention.  If you aren't listening to every line of dialogue you will miss jokes it is that simple.  Each line is crucial to the script either as a storyplot building device or as a joke building device or both.  There is not one wasted word in the script.The cast is classic.  Rebecca Pidgeon Mamet's wife plays the matteroffacttalking girl perfectly.  She is the heart of the film and deserves praise for being able to perform that well.  The other person that deserves high praise is William H. Macy.  His performance is on par with his Fargo performance.  He emits this sense of control as everything falls apart around him and delivers some excellent lines.Baldwin gives a better than average performance as does Durning and Hoffman and the rest of the cast is quite good.The direction is great. The movie seems to last 15 minutes because it is that interesting and fast paced.  The perceived fast pace is created by the actors saying their lines so quickly and crisply. This  can only occur with a director that knows the script but since the script was written by the director the point becomes moot.  Everything else also flows so well and the credit for that has to be given to Mamet's directing and writing ability.I really like this film.  I like the way The Old Mill mirrors the actions of the actual film and how deep the film goes.  This is like one of those classic novels that can be dissected in every way for symbolism and thought which is quite rare in today's cinema.  The film may be too smart for it's own good and may have overshot the general movie audience but makes for a gem of a movie to watch.  Mamet pulls no punches making fun of Hollywood by comparing it to small town America or more importantly Hollywood values to small town American values.  Watch this movie if you want to think and be entertained and if that doesn't sound appealing please go find another movie to watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "This gem of a movie was probably not a blockbuster when released. The storyline is thin and almost nonexistent it could be summed up as everyone gets the chance to screw up a second time. Nevertheless there are enough twists and turns to make what story there is interesting. This must be the sort of movie that every good actor and actress would love to have a role in as the screenplay has been written by an accomplished playwright. It is a farcical melodrama rather than a comedy but nonetheless highly enjoyable.A filmmaking team hard up on critical funds has just been thrown out of a small town in New Hampshire. Their movie's plot necessitates the choice of a small town New England locale and a water mill one reason why they are short of funds is that they had to build an old water mill replica in the New Hampshire town. As the movie begins The Director and his crew find themselves in a small town in Vermont actually most of the scenes are shot in Connecticut or Massachusetts. The beauty of the location is wellcaptured by excellent photography. The makers of State and Main did not fall into the trap of shooting the film during the Fall. New England fall colors would be a major distraction although Alfred Hitchcock's black comedy The Trouble With Harry succeeded despite being shot in Vermont at the peak of the fall leaf color season but then Hitchcock was an exceptional genius.The small town has being going on in its leisurely way until the film crew arrive. The obvious star of State and Main is Philip Seymour Hoffman a previously little known Hollywood actor whose first appeared on the screen as the spoiled rich daddysupported George Willis Jr. In that memorable Al Pacino film Scent of a Woman. Hoffman's key role in State and Main is as the author and screen play writer for the movie within the movie. The better known Hollywood star Alec Baldwin plays the lesser role of the filmin making's male star. He is portrayed as a lustful male whose sexual preference is of under age nubile girls.The Director is played by William H. Macy who is completely unflappable no matter what. The producer arrives after the crew has settled in. The role is played by droopyeyed David Paymer who is completely obsessed with money and will bribe anyone to get things moving. The male star lead is almost fatally distracted by a young teenager Julia Stiles. The female lead and siren Sarah Jessica Parker demands substantial extra money for appearing naked in a scene claiming that she has found religion. Hoffman is smitten in the heart by an attractive young woman Rebecca Pigeon in the town who is engaged or semiengaged to the local bad man and town councilor.I will leave it to the reader's imagination to find out if the film crew gets the second chance to screw up again. The movie is directed by David Mamet a leading American playwright. Mamet wrote the screen plays for wellknown movies such as The Postman Always Rings Twice The Untouchables  and had a minor role as a performer in the 1986 thriller Black Widow. He has directed several movies aside from this one in the past 17 years.It is evident that Mamet  who also wrote the screen play for this charming melodrama was at a loss for a suitable title for the film just like the director in the play who wanted to call his movie The Old Mill only to find out upon arrival in the Vermont town that the much advertised Old Mill had burnt down in 1960. Mamet settled on the uninspiring title State and Main from the intersection where the town's brand new traffic lights still stand at the start of the movie. Interestingly enough the title for the DVD version of State and Main circulating in Greece is translated as Without Title. I am fairly confident that this little known 102 minute melodrama will become a cine buff's classic one day".

The rhythm and pace is more like a sitcom than a feature film sharply edited and light on its feet and with a sort of whitebread jazz motif loitering in the background but the cast is certainly above average and Mamet's screenplay is very charming punctuated with some funny subplots and a few very good maybe even great oneliners.The story concerns a film production crew running out of money who blows into the quaint provincial town of Waterford Vermont on a location shoot after getting run out of New Hampshire for reasons that are very hushhush. The wellspring of much of the humor is in the byplay between the corruptness of the film people and the purity of the locals who turn out to be as rotten as some of the Hollywood crowd. There are also some hilarious insides on the world of showbiz and filmmaking i.e. the associate producer's credit the product placement for a dot.com in a movie set in the 1800's the cinematographer who can't get the shot he wants Sarah Jessica Parker's character who finds religion and won't show her breasts in the film  unless the producers pay her an additional 800 grand.Mamet is not quite in the Woody Allen class of gagwriting but he proves to be assured and witty without being too selfconsciously clever as he is in Heist. Some favorite lines I remember my lines. I just don't remember which order they come in. You don't like children do you? Never saw the point of 'em. and of course Whatever happened to 1975?William H. Macy gives a good funny performance as the wheelerdealer director as good as his work in Fargo or The Cooler and Philip Seymour Hoffman and Rebecca Pidgeon are wonderful as the wouldbe lovers. This is a not great but a good middlebrow satire of different worlds very pleasant and expertly written though just not savage enough to be brutally memorable. 3  out of 4".

	schema:reviewBody "State and Main is a comedy starring Philip Seymour Hoffman Rebecca Pidgeon Sarah Jessica Parker Julia Stiles William H. Macy and Alec Baldwin.The plot involves the onlocation production in Waterford Vermont of a film called The Old Mill.It was written and directed by David Mamet.Havoc is wrought on the inhabitants of a small New England town by a troubled film production. After the leading man's penchant for teenage girls gets them banished from their New Hampshire location a film crew relocates to the small town of Waterford Vermont to finish shooting The Old Mill.As its title suggests the film depends on the presence of a genuine mill something the town is reported to possess. Unfortunately with only days before principal photography begins it becomes apparent that the mill in fact burned down decades ago. Unfazed the film's director Walt Price places his faith in the ability of firsttime screenwriter Joseph Turner White to alter the script what he doesn't count on is White's apparently bottomless reserve of angstfueled writer's block.The film's leading lady refuses to do her contracted nude scene unless she's paid an additional 800000 while a foreign cinematographer offends the locals by messing with a historic firehouse. Meanwhile the leading man Bob Barrenger dallies with Carla a crafty local teen. Everything comes to a head after Barrenger and Carla are injured in a car accident which leads White to another emotional quandary and into the arms of local bookseller Annie Black. Meanwhile a powerful movie producer comes to town to help Price with the ensuing mess.State and Main offers plenty of wit and laughs in its lampoons of the movie industry.It is the funniest and most accessible film to date by David Mamet propelled by the rocket fuel of his showbiz experience and driven by an ensemble cast that simply couldn't be better. Naturally the writer's dilemma is the meatiest one and he arrives at a solution that's as hilarious as it is morally justified. Along the way the rigors of film making are explored with farcical abandon such as how to provide a hightech product placement in a 19thcentury story. His razorsharp dialogue is gourmet popcorn hereeach kernel yields a tasty surpriseand the whole scenario plays out with the breezy assurance of vintage screwball comedy. It's pure gold from start to finish and even the closing credits offer another reason to laugh.Obviouslythe nice thing about it is that it won't disappoint the viewer.".

Mamet's script is a silent riot as we see the rubes go from reading the local paper to Variety all in the background so if you're not paying attention to the background you're missing a substantial part of the humor and foreshadowing of what's going to happen. Everything that can go wrong does go wrong so lawyers are brought in cash is brought in and love is brought in.

	schema:headline " 2 Films By David Mamet";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a brief review of State and Main and Oleander two films by David Mamet.The better of the two State takes Mamet's usual tale of conmen and hucksters and places it in the quiet town of Waterford Vermont. Here the conmen are not gangsters or card players but a group of Hollywood filmmakers who wish to spend several weeks filming in the sleepy town.For a Mamet flick State is surprisingly cute. Much of the film watches as slick bigcity filmmakers try to exploit cuddly small towners only to find that the country folk aren't as simpleminded as they first seemed. By the film's end everyone is taking advantage of everyone else money constantly shifting hands and deals hastily being made.Like Altman's The Player State also satirizes various Hollywood types and Tinseltown customs poking fun at actors lawyers producers cinematographers writers assistants nudity clauses and amateur theatre productions. Unlike Altman's film however Mamet's going for charm and whimsy. It's a lighthearted comedy though it does contain one dark subplot about clashing egos the instability of values see Mamet's Redbelt artistic integrity and the corrosive power of money. It also gives Mamet a chance to indulge in his love for miscommunication and misdirection  for Mamet all language is a con  and allows Alec Baldwin to sink his teeth in one of his best roles since Glengarry Glen Ross.Oleanna also directed by David Mamet is a claustrophobic film which mostly takes place in a single room. The film's first half consists of a Professor having a long discussion with one of his female students. Later we learn that she is failing his class and that she blames this on his inability to clearly communicate. She then accuses him of using his power as a Professor to engage in a sort of word rape stating that she dislikes the way that he constantly uses pretentious words and convoluted metaphors to belittle his students. The second half of the film then shows the balance of power shifting between the Professor and the Student. She now speaks with confidence whilst he continually stammers. She is now dressed with authority whilst he is dishevelled. As this stage of the film progresses she accuses him of sexual assault and threatens to have him fired and arrested. He meanwhile accuses her of misinterpreting his words and actions.Though overly theatrical the film was based on one of Mamet's stage plays Oleanna is endlessly fascinating. Primarily a backlash against the American political correctness movement of the early 1990s the film takes political correctness to absurd lengths the point being that if taken to its logical extreme social sensitivity could become so invasive so overpowering that every interpersonal act could be construed as being sexual or punishable in nature.The film also offers a clever critique of educational systems and their hierarchies of power and allows Mamet to indulge in his love for word games syntax as violence. Indeed the film is one big semantic argument the characters constantly battling over the meaning of words Oleanna highlighting both the power and absurdity of language Mamet has his characters speak in such a fashion as to highlight the very artificiality arbitrariness and vagueness of words andor meaning and the way language leaves us vulnerable to misdirection.In typical Mamet fashion the film eventually reveals itself to be a giant con game. Here it is explained that the female student was part of a Group which is plotting to remove the Professor from the school's faculty. 810  Worth one viewing.".

These 2 fine actors did their best to carry a very poorly written and directed movie while suffering with the total lack of acting talent from their counter parts. At the very least I was hoping to see a not so funny movie with some good acting by some good actors. What a disappointment. Not only was the movie not funny except for a few well delivered lines by William H. Macy it was unwatchable about 40 minutes in due in no small part to the wretched attempted at acting by Rebecca Pigeon. Quite probably the worst Actor in Hollywood. With every line delivered in the same forced stoic tone as the last. No emotion no feeling no understanding at all of what the character is thinking feeling or doing. It was as if she was reading each line from the cue card while filming was taking place. Horrible. The rest of the actors who could actually act were stuck with poorly written dialog that no only was not convincing but seemed jump off the screen in written form as though you were watching the first read through. With everybody asking...what was that supposed to mean. Save yourself the hour and 46 minutes and do something with your life that you'll enjoy.".

	schema:reviewBody "State and Main never fails to reward repeated viewings no matter how many times I watch it and I've watched it at least a dozen times. I could watch it a dozen more times. It's not typical Mamet although I wish it was. The only other Mamet comedies that come to mind are We're No Angels and Wag The Dog and maybe About Last Night. He seems to greatly prefer darker characters and darker themes Glengarry Glen Ross American Buffalo The Verdict Oleanna Edmond etc. etc. and most notably crackling labyrinthine mysteries The Spanish Prisoner Heist House of Games Homicide Spartan.If you listen to the delightful cast commentary on the DVD you will learn that Mamet is trying his hand at madcap comedy in the style of Preston Sturges Unfaithfully Yours 1948. There is never a dull moment. The movie is laced with running gags and brimming with razorsharp wit. Mamet frequently delights us with complex busy tracking shots choreographed to a faretheewell moving from character to character and room to room with supporting characters moving in and out. Mamet is in top form as director and writer which given his prodigious giftshe won the Pulitzer Prize for Glengarry Glen Rossmeans he is working at a level even Woody Allen at the height of his powers would be hard pressed to match.Read the lengthy quotes section if you need proof of this. Every exchange tickles the funnybone. Among the running gags are references to the World Court Of course he's on the coast where's he gonna be The Hague? the spate of suspicious fires that became the inspiration for the Waterford Huskies huh? and the burning question Does it have to be an Old Mill? The pothole in the center of town is another subtle but brilliant comic leitmotiv. Every time you turn around somebody's running through the darn thing. Then one night Alec Baldwin hits the potholeand the consequences send State and Main to a whole new level of hysteria.Some of the best gags are pure throughthelookingglass nonsense. Joe White tells director Walt Price I can only write on manual to which the director replies I know the feeling. Marty Rossen asks Walt How are you getting on with these fine people? and Walt answers cheerfully Like dykes and dogs. Walt tells Claire Wellesey a rambling yarn about Eleanor Duse trying to inspire Claire to stay with the movie but when he gets to the moral of the story8230 And did she do the seven shows? Claire asks. No Claire Walt replies but I think you should do this movie. The cast of State and Main is a dream cast and everyone delivers winning spoton performances. Philip Seymour Hoffman is a standout as the firsttime screenwriter sheepishly trying to hang on to his moral compass and William H. Macy is absolutely superb as the ringmaster who has an attitude to match every situation. But the centerpiece is Rebecca Pidgeon whose placid warmth and wise charm provide the emotional eyeofthestorm the moral center and the Greek chorus for the movie anchoring the whirlwind of personal agendas and flawed characters swirling around her. I will say that I find Mamet's casting of nonactors as bit players more than a bit distracting. He likes to cast his poker buddies the commentary informs us. That Pidgeon's Annie dumps her local politician boyfriend and ends up winning the heart of the idealistic Hollywood screenwriter should confound any attempt to simplistically reduce the film to cynical Hollywood venality invades innocent smalltown America. The movie is much more ambiguous and complex than that. Despite giving in to their worst impulses and coming within a hair's breadth of disaster for the second time the film crew finally does get to make their movie. In the end the moral of the story is The only second chance in life is the chance to make the same mistake twice.".

	schema:headline " Rare Mamet excellent writing and comedy directing";
	schema:reviewBody "Clever quotable and funny David Mamet's dialogue is loved by performers because of its literate substance. State and Main like Day for Night is a look on the inside of the very crazy business of putting together a film and there are some real funny gems in this flic. Mamet's characters are always after something and the reason he is so popular with actors is his ability to write very playable lines. The DVD of State and Main a rare comedy from the writerdirector has a wonderful ensemble of actors presenting a wacky and at times cockeyed version of the filmmaking world. Anyone who has ever worked on an independent film crew will find a rueful pleasure in the characterizations auteur Mamet gains from his actors. The story is about a film crew on location directed by Walt Price William H. Macy in the back woods of Waterford Vermont having been run out of another town in New Hampshire for murky salacious reasons but it is hinted that lead actor Bob Barrenger Alex Baldwin may have had some sort of personal tryst with a young very young... below the age of consent citizen. Walt Price has to find a location to fit the title of the film he's directing The Old Mill and this town reportedly has such a landmark. After the film rents out the hotel and sets up shop they find out that the old mill of the town that is listed in historic literature for the area was burned down in the 1970s as part of some rumored conspiracy one that actually was responsible for the forming of the Waterford Huskies the local fire department. The screenwriter Joseph Turner White Phillip Seymour Hoffman is brought in for rewrites. He is eclectic only writes with an actual typewriter and goes to the local resale shop to find one. There he meets Ann Black the owner of the shop and through their love for theatre she has a copy of White's fist real stage play they form an attraction for each other and begin to fall in love. Love in this world is a brittle thing but not beyond the grasp of two kindred souls like Ann and Joseph and amidst all the shenanigans their relationship is something that weathers the test of any and all conflicts. This screwball comedy escalates to a fast and furious pace as Barrenger hooks up with youngster waitress Carla Julia Stiles and is ultimately arrested for child abuse by Ann's fiance and local politician Doug McKenzie Clark Gregg seeking a trophy for his climb up the local political mountain. Added to this lead actress Claire Wellesley Sarah Jessica Parker refuses a nude scene that she agreed to do to make the film and producer Mary Rossen David Paymer has to finagle some way to appease her and get his lead actor Barrenger out of jail while also attempting to attach postmodern product placement into a period film dated in the 1800s. It all comes to a head but happily for the pure of heart Ann Black and Joseph Turner White and ultimately the film goes into production with the entire town turning our for extra work and emotional support for the crew and those involved. It's all tongueincheek with many a laughable moments generated from the performances the dialogue and this ideas that Mamet generates about the film industry and an alternate culture to be reviled as well as honored for many of the same reasons. A few of the really good lines there are many more punctuated by sight gags!  Walt Price It's not a lie. It's a gift for fiction. Joseph Turner White What's an associate producer credit? Bill Smith It's what you give to your secretary instead of a raise. Bob Barrenger I know my lines.  I just don't know what order they come in. And a great line that gets tossed around by just about every character as an exclamation point to something they've just said  Go you Huskies! I would recommend that any film student see this as class assignment in their first year of film school because it brings up many of the actual issues that a film company faces when making a movie and pokes fun at them at the same time. Mamet has the unique ability to craft very quotable lines and this film has plenty of them and very well placed interacting with visual cues. One of the best scenes is with William Macy and Sarah Jessica Parker in the director and actrees moment in the Eleonora Duse scene in the cramped bathroom.".

I am convinced that the only people that are actually adding comments are people who are either related to David Mamet screenwriterdirector or diehard fans of his.For me this movie could not end soon enough.  The cast included a long list of Blevel stars but good actors nonetheless.  I am personally a big fan of Alec Baldwin David Paymer and Charles Durning.  But no amount of big names could make up for a horrible script very poor direction and the worst cinematic score I have ever heard.Critiquing a movie like this is so hard because there is so much wrong with it.  And I had no intention of writing one until I read all of these rave reviews.I will start with what bothered me the most.  The music.  Not only was it boring and unpleasant to the ears it was constant.  It began with opening credits and didn't end until the rolling credits.Next I don't know much about David Mamet.  He had many talented actors to work with but did not allow them to shine. Instead he turned them into one of his infamous Mametbots.  They are so busy trying to be cute that they lose any amount of interest that may have made them successful in the first place ie. Philip Seymour Hoffman.There are so few moments in the movie that are funny.  The jokes that other people have referred to as clever because they go throughout the movie just don't work.  The big finale of BAZOOMS.COM being worked into the movie was so predictable that it lost any sense of wit.Chemistry between characters was also missing.  Another important element of movies that this one lacks.  The most obvious example is the supposed love interest between Hoffman and Pattie LuPone.  I never saw it or felt it. And who told LuPone that it if she cocked her head and smiled in every seen it would funny.  Its not.  Even the very likable LuPone manages to get under the viewer's skin.There are so many subplots that no single story gets the attention to fully form.  Which is probably a good thing since not a single story was ever interesting enough to grab my attention.From watching this movie this is what I have concluded about David Mamet. After some successful and entertaining movies he is now in a bubble.  He thinks that every idea he has deserves its own movie.  Someone should stop being Mamet's yesman and let him know how it is.  All of his ideas aren't funny.  In fact most of them are not.  Mamet appears to have undergone the same change that George Lucas has gone through.  They hit middle age and have lost their edge.This movie is boring not witty and a complete waste of time.  I rarely leave a movie with nothing good to say but this one of them.  This is not artsy or insightful.  Its boring and dull and reflects the thoughts of man out of ideas and insight.".

Most of the townsfolk emerge as minor background characters at best with the possible exception of Rebecca Pidgeon as Annie Joe's eventual love interest.  Pidgeon who looks uncannily like Marlo Thomas in her That Girl' days seems sweet as all get out but the atonal delivery of most of her lines hampers the interest we might otherwise find in her character.   Actually none of these characters are very interesting  or very funny.  In fact most of them seem rather pathetic when you get right down to it and Mamet fails to provide the satirical wit and bite that would mitigate some of their unpleasantness.  He doesn't generate the kind of outandout hearty laughter that Christopher Guest derived from his examinations of rural America in movies like Waiting For Guffman' and Best of Show.' Mamet's take is in many ways so cynical that he seems to have forgotten to engender the kind of affection for his people that helps keep condescension at bay.  Or perhaps it is really so much simpler than that  maybe he merely neglected to write any truly funny material this time around.".

The film is beautifully photographed in a way which gives texture to the story and reality to the characters. This must be one of the top British films of the Forties and can stand beside anything Hollywood was doing at the time or any time for that matter. The script is credited to Graham Greene based on his Novel and the unlikely seeming Terence Rattigan Separate Tables Winslow Boy et al. Without knowing who contributed what to the final screenplay I can say that it is a beautiful and coherent piece of work that has character development as well as terse and atmospheric dialog that keeps the viewer engrossed and the tension high.Recommended especially to fans of film noir".

	schema:headline " An Early Green Masterpiece About Pure Evil";
	schema:reviewBody "It was written by Graham Greene in the 1930s shortly after a notorious murder case or cases in 1934 wherein two women's bodies were found in trunks in the Brighton Railway Station. One of the women was identified and her loverhusband Tony Mancini who accidentally killed her in a freak accident during an argument barely got acquitted due to his lawyer Norman Birkett. The other woman was traced but an ambitious local policeman wrecked the nearly completed case against a socially well connected abortionist. That Brighton the socalled fun center for vacationing Brits was soiled by this double tragedy goes without saying. Greene added to it the growing problem of rival criminal gangs working at race tracks and in various rackets. Big time crime is not only an American problem but is in every country. The figure of the successful thug Colleoni Charles Goldner is a good 1930 style version of the Krays of the 1960s.BRIGHTON ROCK as a film with screenplay by Greene and Terrance Rattigan actually sticks pretty close to the novel except perhaps in the characterization of Ida Arnold Hermoine Baddeley  later Mrs. Naugatuck on the television comedy MAUDE and in the conclusion concerning the record that is left by Pinkie Richard Attenborough with his overly fixated wife Rose Carol Marsh. Greene was always using his novels to push his Catholicism but he was a tragic realist at the bottom. Ida is shown to be determined to get justice for the dead newsman Fred Hale  Kolley Kibber Alan Wheatley. But Greene never likes this avenger  he finds that she unconsciously stirs up more trouble for others including the unfortunate Spicer Wylie Watson than her actions are worth. As for the record at the end of the film it is broken due to Pinkie's attempt to destroy it. So it ironically only repeats him saying I love you. In the novel poor Rose plays it as the book ends and as the readers depart  it probably spews forth his actual message of hatred to her.Pinkie may be the worst villain in Greene's novels. He was the loyal young lieutenant of the original gang leader Kite whose death is mentioned at the start of the film  and is due to an expose that Hale published. Pinkie is ruthless and smart so he has assumed leadership of the gang over the aging Spicer the more rational Cubitt Nigel Stock and Dallow William Hartnell in a typically well done underplayed role  which surprises us at the end. However Pinkie is immature and ruthless. He sees himself as the equal of Colleoni who is capable of spitting out enough torpedoes and goons in an hour to threaten Pinkie than the latter realizes. Pinkie never wavers from his target or goal and we watch the steps he uses to follow the frightened Hale to the latter's end in the films first twenty minutes. He uses similar concentration on results to kill one other character blackmail one other person and manipulate the love besotted Rose throughout the film. But his actions are never carefully thought through. Several times he actually has all the cards in his hands to win or get away with the murder but his immaturity and temper keep ruining his success.Rose is equally interesting  a thoroughly decent and sweet girl. Like Pinkie she is a Catholic but a better one ironically he once thought of being a priest. She finds him threatening but also reassuring once he is aware he can control her he sees little real reason to do her harm  until the conclusion of the film. She even speaks up for him against Ida trying to warn her about the threat to her because Rose accidentally can trip up the perfection of Pinkie's alibi for Hale's death.The murder of Hale in a Dante's Inferno Fun House on Brighton Pier is wonderfully done using the faces of the evil spirits in the darkened tunnel to counterpoint the helplessness of Hale's situation. But the murder in the book is different. Hale is lured to an isolated spot and he choked to death by Pinkie using a popular candy called a Brighton Rock thrust down the journalist throat. That was the reason for the title an ironic counterpoint to the holiday atmosphere of the town and the murder itself. Instead we see Hale is drowned in the film. Still it is an very effective sequence. The other actors are pretty good. Watson is best recalled for another sad victim he played a decade earlier he was the unfortunate Mr. Memory in Hitchcock's THE THIRTY NINE STEPS. Also there is Harcourt Williams as Pinkie's lawyer Pruitt. Williams best remembered for some of his roles in the Olivier Shakespeare films plays the elderly crooked lawyer as a figure of some pathos he realizes he is a ruin of the man he should have been pointing out to Ida his photograph as a public school boy decades before. The film is a rich one and time prevents from mentioning other points in it. Suffice to say that to keep his alibi and perfect crime perfect Pinkie must marry Rose and must seek the moment to get rid of her while Ida tries to get the authorities to reopen the murder. But in the end he finds literally his plans collapse to destroy him. One last point the death of Kite was an event that Greene mentions in another novel of the period that also was turned into a popular film. Another member of the gang was Raven the killer who leaves the gang and becomes a hitman in THIS GUN FOR HIRE. Probably had he stayed in Brighton he not Pinkie would have led the gang. That would have been a different story.".

	schema:reviewBody "Brighton Rock is directed by John Boulting and written by Graham Greene also 1938 novel and Terence Rattigan. Produced by Roy Boulting it stars Richard Attenborough Carol Marsh William Hartnell Hermione Baddeley Harcourt Williams and Wylie Watson. Music is scored by Hans May and cinematography is by Harry Waxman. Plot finds Attenborough as small time Brighton hoodlum Pinkie Brown whose attempts to cover up a murder sees events spiral out of control for himself and those closest to him.1947 was a good year for tough gritty British drama in fact it was a key year in the progression of British cinema. It was the year that would see the release of They Made Me A Fugitive It Always Rains On Sunday Odd Man Out and Brighton Rock. The latter film arguably the one that looks the most dated is the one that shocked the most upon its release. Refreshing then to find that in spite of the aged edges of the narrative frame it still today has a power a bleakness that justifies the classic status afforded it. Part seedy seaside noir part character driven observation on Catholic guilt and torment Brighton Rock overcomes some slight old time technical flaws to thrive on thematic potency and a tense narrative.Many authors find their respective work losing impetus during the translation to the big screen Graham Greene is one who hasn't had to suffer in that department. Key issue for those adapting his work is to understand the characterisations at work thankfully the Boulting brothers grasp that Pinkie Brown surely one of Greene's greatest creations has a complexity that needs him front and centre of the brewing maelstrom. The plot then tumbles out around him as the seedy underbelly of Brighton's everyday life is exposed. The casting of Attenborough as Pinkie was a masterstroke fresh faced and wide eyed Attenborough plays it as coiled spring like his psychosis troubling and ready to explode at any given moment. His cold hearted relationship with the homely desperate for love Rose Marsh is utterly disturbing and it's that relationship that underpins the story.Story is set amongst two sides of Brighton one side is sunny full of lights funfairs and candy floss the other features grimy boarding houses penny caf's and loud back street beer houses. The neat trick the Boulting's pull is that we know the sunny side is merely a facade to darker forces much of the badness is played out to the backdrop of seaside frivolity and relaxation. With the iconic pier serving as a dual witness to both the good and bad side of Brighton's current denizens. Aided by Waxman's oppressive photography J Boulting paints in claustrophobic strokes perfectly enveloping the lead protagonists in a number of restrictive setups where the surroundings deftly match the mood of the individual. It's going to end bad it has too the atmosphere tells us that but the makers are reveling in tightening the noose one turn at a time and that's a sure fire bonus for film noir lovers.Film is well cast across the board with Hartnell most notable as Pinkie gang member Dallow while Baddeley as Pinkie's bold and brassy adversary Ida Arnold is suitably annoying. Memorable characters one and all each one serving to add fuel to Attenborough's malevolent fire. How great it is to also take away a number of memorable scenes from the movie. From the pulse raising chase at the beginning to the weird and haunting brutality of a ghost train sequence and to the cruel finale that drips with cynicism it's a film that refuses to leave the conscious after the credits have rolled. The ending may have been toned down from that of the novel but what remains still bites hard as does in truth the whole film. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "Along with Ealing's 'Pink String and Sealing Wax' this film established Brighton as England's most Noirish location a corrupt place full of tacky delights hiding violence and desperation Blackpool occupies that place in British pop culture now  see particularly the TV series 'Funland'. It's hardly surprising that an island nation so frequently locates threatening forces at coastal locations  just look at the Whitby sections in 'Dracula' or Powell and Pressburger's 'The Spy in Black' for two of the more obvious examples.This the Boulting Brothers' masterpiece and arguably the greatest of all British Gangster films a relatively select prestigious genre until the rush prompted by 'Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' is also the closest thing to a proper British film noir. All the elements are in place  the seedy milieu the violence the pathological central character the betrayed innocent even the thread of Catholic imagery that is highly unusual in British film but fairly common in American crime dramas other than Rose I can't think of a single character in 1940's British cinema who owns a rosary  everyone tends to be very Church of England.Although Attenborough's electrifying Pinkie is the centre of the film the heart of the story seems to be the confrontation of Ida and Rose in his bedroom. Rose naively thinks she can change him. Ida knows better and interestingly refutes the possibility of redemption invoking the eponymous image of the Rock stamped through with one word no matter where you cut it. In the context of the Catholic background of the characters that's an incredibly bleak assessment and the film supports her  Pinkie can't change and doesn't even want to. The Nun at the end offers a more optimistic take on events suggesting that the possibility of redemption can be found in all love  but Pinkie's love was a lie and the cruel irony of the final moments is that Rose never discovers his true nature. She is not saved from her absurdly romanticised ideal of him and it would be salvation no matter how soul destroying the film almost feels like a response to all those loversonthelam films from America although it predates most of them puncturing their romanticised depiction of the life of crime. 'They Live By Night' seems somewhat absurd after this.Hermione Baddeley is brilliant as Ida Nemesis reinvented as a raucous broad her clattering laughter pursuing Pinkie like the rhythm of Poe's TellTale Heart. She's the one character who won't compromise or be corrupted  she selfeffacingly insists that she's 'just like everyone else' in believing that justice should be done but noone else in the film gives a damn about justice. She also believes in saving Rose from herself  when she announces herself as Rose's mother in order to gain access to her in some ways she's not far off the truth. She's a mother figure for the desperate  Fred wants her to protect him to be 'looked after'. She pursues the truth behind his death with a vigour normally associated in crime dramas with bereaved parents but with the clarity of a Private Detective  she figures out Pinkie's motives with great acuity. Her transition from comic relief to dynamic moral compass is remarkable. There may be no more forceful female figure  certainly no more heroic one  in British cinema of the Forties.William Hartnell is equally good as Dallow Pinkie's quietly menacing righthand man who reaches a line he finds he can't cross. There are great supporting turns from Harcourt Williams as a dissolute lawyer alleviating his misery with Shakespearean quotation and Wylie Watson as an ageing gangster aware that he is running out of luck and favours. Charles Goldner is pretty good unexpectedly restrained and businesslike rather than menacing as rival gangster Colleoni tantalisingly close to Corleone and Victoria Winter shines in her brief screen time as Dallow's girl Judy both warm and down to earth.The only problematic performance is Carol Marsh as Rose. In fairness she's a difficult character to play  how does she fall for a man who is so openly menacing overtly threatening to cut up her face on their first date if she talks to the police? Marsh is good in the early scenes at the caf believably nervous but friendly but she struggles to make Rose anything other than a laughably naive twerp once the romance with Pinkie gets underway. It isn't as though either script or actor plays him as irresistible charmer or even deceiving lover. He threatens and neglects her and she repays him with puppyeyed love. It's hard to take and yet... the simplicity of her performance may be the least awkward way through a script that refuses to explain what she's doing. A better actress might have hinted at or drawn something out but it would always seem awkward. At least Marsh suggests total helplessness  if ever a performance was asking for the tag of 'lamb to the slaughter' this is it.Boulting's direction is for the most part fabulous although the ghosttrain ride is a little overdone on the other hand the pursuit of Fred through the streets that precedes it is brilliant dynamic in a way too few British pictures are and the murder of Spicer is unforgettable  a great use of montage.This film dates from slap bang in the middle of British cinema's golden age which arguably began with Hitchcock's 'The Man Who Knew Too Much' in the mid thirties and ended with the last great Ealing Comedy 'The Ladykillers' in 1955. After that great films became very much rarer. In the midst of the strongest slate of films in British Cinema however 'Brighton Rock' still stands out. This was a career high for everyone involved  not least Attenborough.".

The film is a disturbing insight into the Brighton's gangs that nobody wants to talk about. The film has that subtle edge that only black and white movies can and there is a classic twist at the end. This is a must for anybody who loves black and white movies and will have you on the edge of your seat. If you haven't seen this movie then make a point to do so you won't be disappointed.".

	schema:reviewBody "If Richard Attenborough hadn't been careful in his choice of roles he might very well have been typecast as a stone cold killer the rest of his career. It was the same problem that Richard Widmark had after Kiss Of Death. In Brighton Rock Attenborough is absolutely riveting and charismatic as gang leader Pinkie Brown.In the British seaside resort town of Brighton Attenborough and his cronies run a protection racket and are being muscled by another gang who wants to take over their territory. In America this would call for a public machine gun blasting but in the United Kingdom they do things in a bit more subtle way. After a prolonged chase through Brighton Attenborough nails one of the other gang members Alan Wheatley in a fun house tunnel ride where there's even question that Wheatley might have slipped and fallen on his own.But there are questions and Hermione Baddely is raising them having been with Wheatley before he died and knowing how scared he was. There's also a witness after the fact who could destroy his alibi a young and very innocent waitress played by Carol Marsh.The reason Brighton Rock works so well is the terrifying portrait of Attenborough as a killer. Attenborough has to be a charismatic figure or the older members of his group would not be looking to him as the leader. They fear him too but eventually the fear takes over the sway he has on the group.Carol Marsh is good in her part. She's such an innocent a Trilby like creature who Attenborough works like a Svengali over and gets her actually to marry him just so she can't give evidence against him in Wheatley's murder. But when a couple more deaths occur Marsh is frightened but still entranced with Attenborough.The final climax on the Brighton pier is as terrifying as any noir film you might see in America at that time. It even eclipses Wheatley's demise earlier which is also a highlight. Brighton Rock holds very well after 62 years and compares very well with some of the best American noir films of the time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Now this is a real find sandwiched in between a studioenforced happy ending and a lawyerappeasing opening text that claims Brighton isn't like this any more we have one of the finest British films.In 1999 the British Film Institute voted for what they regarded to be the 100 greatest British movies ever made. Brighton Rock came in at 15th position a short way ahead of perhaps more realistic gangster offerings such as Get Carter! and The Long Good Friday. It's deserved though obviously the film's major complaint with a modern audience would be the stilted speech patterns that are now too quaint for a modern context a time when men still called women ducks and Bogeys were policemen and the harsh violence is now tame and ripe for parody.Amazing that Richard Attenborough he of everchanging accent in Jurassic Park is here cast as a viscous gang leader. Stranger still is the sight of William Hartnell as a toughtalking Cockney exclaiming stick yer mincers on that. Much later in his life Hartnell was to suffer a nervous breakdown leaving him with a poor memory and occasional stammer. This produces illadvised amusement as his most famous role  that of the first lead in television's Doctor Who  was performed with regular fluffs and stammers. Here however sixteen years before he was to take on that part we are treated to just what a striking and charismatic actor Hartnell could be. While the violent aspects can look dated in context seeing cuddly Bill Hartnell spitting in a man's home after Attenborough has just slashed the man's face with a razor blade is still disconcerting. Attenborough is Pinkie caught between the police and a larger rival gang who have taken over the Brighton protection racket. After a waitress Judy gets too close to his false alibis he marries her to assure her silence. Though the girl is played with believable insecurity it's unlikely that anyone could really fall in love with someone as openly spiteful as Pinkie. The notion of charming a girl is completely alien to him and he begins their first date by implying he'd slash her face. His character is drawn up by having him believe in Hell though not necessarily in Heaven and showing a predilection for cat's cradles. Though these displays could overstate his evil credentials in Richard's performance and John Boulting's direction it is a coldly accurate portrayal.If there's one grain of sympathy for Pinkie it is that of an underdog. His territory eaten up by the much larger Colleoni gang he's effectively forced out of Brighton with nowhere to go. Photography is excellent the black and white adding style to what could have easily been a flatter runofthemill crime yarn. I especially liked the shots of Brighton town and scenes on the ghost train. Best of all is the scene where everyone's laughing at Pinkie's expense including it seems a china doll. There's a real sense of the classic to this one each shot set up with some precision a directoral style that Variety blasted at the time of release claiming it to be too leisurely for this type of picture. Personally I think it adds a real sense of style or maybe it's just the long shadows that add a touch of noir. Interestingly the somewhat obscure title refers not to a romanticallysounding desolate landmark but to the seaside sweet. Concern artist Ida Hermione Baddeley claims that no matter how far you bite down into her she'd have Brighton written through her all the way. Understandably this esoteric  if powerful  title was changed in America to a more comprehensible Young Scarface.".

There's a real sense of the classic to this one each shot set up with some precision a directoral style that Variety blasted at the time of release claiming it to be too leisurely for this type of picture. Personally I think it adds a real sense of style or maybe it's just the long shadows that add a touch of noir. Interestingly the somewhat obscure title refers not to a romanticallysounding desolate landmark but to the seaside sweet. Concern artist Ida Hermione Baddeley claims that no matter how far you bite down into her she'd have Brighton written through her all the way. Understandably this esoteric  if powerful  title was changed in America to a more comprehensible Young Scarface.";

Suffice it to say that by the end of the film this cryptic message becomes true.I'm not a big fan of pure gangster films but this one is different. Perhaps due to the fact that it's based on a Graham Greene novel. That assures that the plot will never be boring and will be infused with suspense terror intrigue and moral failings as well as moral redemption.This is a very good movie with fine performances by all the players involved. There are not a lot of pretty people in this film but true character actors in the best sense of the word. Yes some may play to obvious stereotypes but it is done so convincingly so as not to come across clich.I enjoyed the sets and location shooting throughout the film. From the shabby mob walkup apartment the seedy dark alleys during one of the chases the exuberant beach and boardwalk areas the pier and amusement park and the racetrack. It all keeps you sufficiently interested and in tune with the mood of the story as it evolves. There are several standout cinematography scenes like the tunnel of horrors the banister murderfall and the closing pier scene shot at night. I don't know a lot about filming but I image back in the 40's it was difficult to adequately light night filming while still keeping it looking like night. It was very well done unlike say movies from the late 50's early 60's where the night shooting was obviously shot during the day but with a dark filter over the lens.I did have trouble following some of the dialogue however due to the clipped British accents. I'm afraid it caused me to lose some of the fluidity of the film. But I could still follow along. I wish it had been offered with closed captions.I loved the gramophone recording sequence. While Pinkie is recording his hate filled message Rose is looking in through the recording booth's glass oblivious with such love and admiration. It was quite a twist how it comes into play at the end of the movie  quite a different ending than from Graham Greene's book. I'm not sure which I would have preferred. Carol Marsh's portrayal of the sweet and innocent though misled Rose is a breath of fresh air amongst all the hardened consciencelacking mobsters.There are Green's spiritual mainly Catholic inferences throughout the film  the rosary confession talk of the existence of hell and MAYBE a heaven a sign at the track reading The wages of sin is death to the ending in the convent with Rose and a nun and the final shot of the crucifix. Some hate the insertion of anything religious into entertainment unless of the occult nature  then its perfectly fine but I think it's a valuable tool and an important part of many people's lives  so why not represent it in film. This is not done much today for fear of offending someone. One of the last lines of the film is the Mother Superior telling Rose You or I cannot fathom the appalling strangeness of the mercy of God. Quite true in a world void of mercy  then and now.".

	schema:reviewBody "During the interwar years the Sussex resort of Brighton became notorious for the activities of criminal gangs and this side of Brighton life was dramatised in Graham Greene's 1938 novel Brighton Rock. The title refers to a type of confectionery traditionally sold in British seaside resorts. The book was made into a film in 1947 by which time according to the introductory captions gangsterism had entirely ceased and the town was once again a tranquil lawabiding community. In actual fact this was far from true wartime black marketeering had if anything given a boost to criminal activity both in Brighton and elsewhere but this disclaimer however fictitious was necessary of the filmmakers were to secure the support of the town's Corporation for location filming.The main character is Pinkie Brown the youthful leader of a gang of thugs whose principal activity is protection racketeering. Early in the film Pinkie murders Fred Hale a journalist who has been investigating his gang's activities by pushing him off the town's Palace Pier. Although the police regard the death as an accident Pinkie tries to cover his tracks by creating a false alibi for himself which leads to the commission of further crimes and to Pinkie's marriage to Rose a young waitress who he believes might be in possession of evidence which could send him to the gallows. Pinkie is not in love with Rose but marries her because at the time the film was made there was a rule of English law that a wife could not give evidence against her husband.Greene himself wrote the screenplay for the film adaptation together with Terence Rattigan but he changed the ending which is perhaps not the most successful part of the original novel. He kept the novel's concern with Roman Catholicism but changed its emphasis. In the book Pinkie is a convinced Catholic believer who somehow manages to reconcile his religious faith with his criminal lifestyle. In the film he never mentions religion until he catches sight of a rosary in Rose's handbag the implication being that he is only pretending to be a fellowCatholic in order to impress her. The film places a much greater emphasis on Rose's spiritual development including a final twist which is not in the novel but which nevertheless makes for a more satisfying ending.The film is not flawless and there are a couple of plotholes. Would a national newspaper really have used one of their leading investigative reporters as their seaside mystery man even sending him to a town where his journalism had made him enemies? Would an innocent young girl like Rose really have fallen for someone as charmless as Pinkie who makes little attempt to hide his contempt for her? A girl with the looks of Carol Marsh would hardly lack for male admirers. And yet this is one of the greatest British crime films of the period perhaps of all time.Although Brighton Rock was made in blackandwhite it was not unlike some British crime films from the period made in direct imitation of the dark moody American film noir style. There is a clear distinction between the public and private realms. Those scenes set outdoors or in public places are light and cheerful reflecting the atmosphere of a warm summer's day by the seaside. The film is set in early June perhaps at Whitsun which was still an official Bank Holiday in the thirties. By contrast Pinkie and his gang live in a drab seedy lodging house of the type familiar from many British kitchen sink dramas. Crime has clearly not paid for the gang it is notable that one of the victims of their protection rackets lives in more style than they do.The acting in the film is of a uniformly high standard. There are good contributions from the likes of Carol Marsh and Harcourt Williams as the corrupt lawyer Prewitt but the two which really stand out are from Hermione Baddeley as Ida Arnold and Richard Attenborough as Pinkie. Ida the one person who believes that Fred's death was suspicious is at first sight not a particularly attractive character. She is an ageing showgirl loud coarse and brassy. She does however have a strong sense of right and wrong and is determined to secure justice for Fred who was neither her lover nor a close friend merely a casual acquaintance. It is her investigations which eventually persuade the police to take action. Brighton Rock takes an unusually critical view of the police who are portrayed as too complacent other British films of the period notably The Blue Lamp show them in a much more idealised light.Attenborough's Pinkie is one of the greatest representations of pure evil in the history of the cinema. Young in years but old in sin his smooth boyish face never betrays any emotion but hatred resentment and selfpity. He has no feelings for anyone but himself not for Rose whom he despises nor for his fellow gang members one of whom he murders for alleged cowardice. Like Macbeth he discovers that his first murder can never be the beall and the endall and is forced in desperation to commit further crimes as his attempts to cover his tracks misfire and his criminal empire starts to crumble.This is a short film but one packed with action and director John Boulting paces it superbly to create both a sense of mounting tension and a sense of an inevitable nemesis hanging over its vicious antihero. The cinema rarely comes closer to pure tragedy than this. In my view this is perhaps the greatest ever British gangster film greater even than Get Carter which is high praise indeed. 910".

	schema:headline " Pinkie's Violent Journey";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie is famous for the tough and uncompromising way in which it depicts the types of gangsterism that were prevalent in Brighton in the period between the two world wars. Based on Graham Greene's classic novel of the same name Brighton Rock is a story about revenge murder and Catholic guilt but most of all it's about a troubled young gang leader and the action he takes to deal with a series of problems. Threats that emanate from the existence of a more powerful rival gang dissent within his own gang and a potential witness whose evidence could get him executed are just a few of his concerns but then as a Roman Catholic he's also sharply aware of where his violent journey is taking him and tormented by his inability to change course.Pinkie Brown Richard Attenborough is the new leader of a small gang whose original leader William Kite was killed following the publication of a newspaper article written by journalist Fred Hale Alan Wheatley. One of the gang recognises Hale's picture in The Daily Messenger in a section that advertises a promotion that the paper is due to carry out in Brighton in the next few days in which Hale operating under the name Kolley Kibber will be handing out cash prizes to people who recognise him. When this piece of information is drawn to the attention of Pinkie he becomes determined to take revenge on Hale for bringing about the death of the only person he really cared about.During the gang's pursuit of Hale through the streets and pubs of Brighton the terrified journalist tries to befriend some women including a seaside entertainer called Ida Arnold Hermione Baddeley in the hope that being in their company might offer him some protection. Eventually however he tries to keep out of sight on a ghost train but is horrified to suddenly find Pinkie sitting next to him. By the time the train reaches the end of its journey it's carrying one passenger less than it started with and Hale's body is washed up on the shore some hours later.As part of his promotional work Hale had distributed a number of cards around the resort and in an effort to provide himself with an alibi for the time of the murder Pinkie arranges for gang member Spicer Wylie Watson to carry on delivering the Kolley Kibber cards after Hale's death. Pinkie is later alarmed to discover that Spicer had left a card at a local caf and becomes very anxious about the possible consequences if he was seen doing so. In order to try to safeguard himself Pinkie goes to the caf and befriends a young waitress called Rose Carol Marsh who has a very clear memory of the man who left the card at one of her tables.Ida Arnold is very suspicious about the circumstances surrounding Hale's death and becomes determined to see that the culprit is brought to justice. Pinkie's continuing efforts to cover up his crime lead to him killing Spicer and marrying Rose to ensure that as his wife she won't be able to give evidence against him. Things continue to get more difficult for Pinkie for a variety of reasons and lead him to decide that another killing is necessary but the events that follow don't pan out as he'd planned.As well as being notable for its realism Brighton Rock also features a collection of memorable characters top class dialogue and some superb expressionistic cinematography that contributes so much to the grim atmosphere of the piece. Inevitably though it's the character Pinkie Brown and Richard Attenborough's amazing performance that leaves the most indelible impression on anyone who's seen this film. The very young Attenborough is perfect as the ruthless 17yearold psychopath whose belief in the existence of Hell is incredibly strong and the contribution of the supporting cast is also consistently good.".

One of the gang recognises Hale's picture in The Daily Messenger in a section that advertises a promotion that the paper is due to carry out in Brighton in the next few days in which Hale operating under the name Kolley Kibber will be handing out cash prizes to people who recognise him. When this piece of information is drawn to the attention of Pinkie he becomes determined to take revenge on Hale for bringing about the death of the only person he really cared about.During the gang's pursuit of Hale through the streets and pubs of Brighton the terrified journalist tries to befriend some women including a seaside entertainer called Ida Arnold Hermione Baddeley in the hope that being in their company might offer him some protection. Eventually however he tries to keep out of sight on a ghost train but is horrified to suddenly find Pinkie sitting next to him. By the time the train reaches the end of its journey it's carrying one passenger less than it started with and Hale's body is washed up on the shore some hours later.As part of his promotional work Hale had distributed a number of cards around the resort and in an effort to provide himself with an alibi for the time of the murder Pinkie arranges for gang member Spicer Wylie Watson to carry on delivering the Kolley Kibber cards after Hale's death. Pinkie is later alarmed to discover that Spicer had left a card at a local caf and becomes very anxious about the possible consequences if he was seen doing so. In order to try to safeguard himself Pinkie goes to the caf and befriends a young waitress called Rose Carol Marsh who has a very clear memory of the man who left the card at one of her tables.Ida Arnold is very suspicious about the circumstances surrounding Hale's death and becomes determined to see that the culprit is brought to justice. Pinkie's continuing efforts to cover up his crime lead to him killing Spicer and marrying Rose to ensure that as his wife she won't be able to give evidence against him. Things continue to get more difficult for Pinkie for a variety of reasons and lead him to decide that another killing is necessary but the events that follow don't pan out as he'd planned.As well as being notable for its realism Brighton Rock also features a collection of memorable characters top class dialogue and some superb expressionistic cinematography that contributes so much to the grim atmosphere of the piece. Inevitably though it's the character Pinkie Brown and Richard Attenborough's amazing performance that leaves the most indelible impression on anyone who's seen this film. The very young Attenborough is perfect as the ruthless 17yearold psychopath whose belief in the existence of Hell is incredibly strong and the contribution of the supporting cast is also consistently good.";

	schema:reviewBody "If ever there was an old film that I am glad had closed captioning it's this one. As an American and a person with a slight hearing loss I never could have watched BRIGHTON ROCK unless it had closed captions. That's because unlike many British films this featured the accents of the working and lowerclasswhich are MUCH harder to understand for nonBrits. While the captioning was not perfect it sure helped me follow along and enjoy the film so I'd recommend that even if your hearing is 2020 ha! try turning on the captions when you watch iteven if they are at times far from perfect.The story is about a smalltime gang of thugs working in Brighton a seaside resort in England. At the beginning of the film they catch up to a man who betrayed them and the vicious guy played by Richard Attenborough kills him. However the gang didn't do a great job hiding their tracks and the everparanoid Attenborough goes to extraordinary lengths to make sure the trail stays cold. Unfortunately since the film makers apparently were pressured to point out that Brighton is a safe and wonderful place hence the seemingly unnecessary prologue you know that by the time all is said and done that the gang will get theirslest the film hurt tourism. This is actually a problem with the filmthe film makers didn't want to make waves with local officials and you can just assume that it will have a crime does not pay ending. Too bad as the film does otherwise get very high marks for its gritty realism. One horrific scene involves a banisterand fans of film noir will no doubt love this.Overall a gripping film with a particularly colorful and nasty performance by Attenborough. I loved his scar and unrelentingly awful character. Also look for William Hartnell as one of the gang membershe was the first Doctor from the Doctor Who TV series. It's just a shame that the film makers telegraphed how the film must end.".

	schema:reviewBody "Based on the 1938 novel of the same name by Graham Greene this is a fascinating exploration of morality and the darker side of human nature. I read the novel six or seven years ago so my memories of it are not particularly fresh but I think that the film sticks closely to it with the exception of toning down the Catholic doctrine  damnation theme and the ending which I will discuss later. As such the film has a very strong script written by Greene himself and Terence Rattigan. It is extremely well directed by John Boulting and the black and white cinematography by Harry Waxman is beautiful. Atypically for British films of the era it was filmed on location in Brighton. This was to the film's benefit as the nice seaside holiday resort atmosphere is a great contrast to the underworld elements.Richard Attenborough is simply marvellous as the psychopathic 17yearold gangster Pinkie Brown a role which he reprised from the 1944 West End adaptation. It is an absolutely riveting and often chilling performance. Pinkie is not a particularly verbose character  he has only one line in the first 15 minutes for instance  and he seldom raises his voice but the intense way in which he stares at people makes him terrifying. His face is often half in shadow which adds to the effect. More importantly the film does not shy away from presenting him as an amoral callous bastard. The fact that Attenborough had a baby face and was quite a short slight man provides a fantastic contrast to Pinkie's behaviour as unlike many other film gangsters he is in no way physically imposing. It is his strength of personality which makes people fear him. It is one of Attenborough's best known performances but it is interesting that he became well known for playing steadfast deeply moral thoroughly decent and courageous men in his most of later films.Carol Marsh otherwise best known for playing Lucy Holmwood in Dracula 1958 is very good as the sweet naive and deluded Rose. As she is aware of the fact that Fred Hale was dead when Pinkie and his gang claimed that he was still alive Pinkie manipulates her into marrying him so that she will not be able to testify against him. Like Pinkie she is a 17yearold Catholic but she is far less worldly than her new husband and does not realise that he despises her. In his gramophone recording he makes this very clear You asked me to make a record of me voice. Well here it is. What you want me to say is 'I love you.' Here's the truth I hate you you little slut. Charming.The film has a very strong supporting cast such as Hermione Baddeley as the principled forceful brass Ida Arnold William Hartnell as Pinkie's frightening rightman hand Dallow who eventually displays a glimmer of conscience Harcourt Williams as the alcoholic Shakespeare quoting lawyer Prewitt Attenborough's future The Great Escape costar Nigel Stock as Cubitt Alan Wheatley as the murder victim Fred Hale Reginald Purnell as Frank Spicer and George Carney who died the very month that the film was released as Phil Corkery. It also features a small appearance from Marianne Stone whom Attenborough would later direct in Oh! What a Lovely War in which he returned to Brighton.Now onto the ending. In the final scene after Pinkie has committed suicide Rose plays the aforementioned record but it becomes stuck and plays I love you over and over again. I have seen this described as upbeat when compared with the novel's ending in which Rose hears the full message but I can't agree. I think that it is very depressing that a very nice young girl is so deluded that she thinks that a boy who was repulsed by her and wanted to murder her was in love with her. It's less bleak than the ending of the novel but not by much. In any event there is nothing to stop her from listening to the full message the next time that she plays it. It is a rare example of a film changing the ending of a novel without completely invalidating the original one.Overall this is an excellent and thrilling example of film noir which pushed the limits of what was acceptable in British films in the 1940s.".

	schema:headline " Classic British gangster film";
	schema:reviewBody "One doesn't really expect to see Richard Attenborough playing anybody who isn't a nice person at heart but in Brighton Rock his character Pinkie Brown is rotten to the core.The film opens with a man arriving in Brighton he is working for a news paper leaving cards which finders can claim ten shillings for also according to the paper anybody who identifies him and says the correct words can claim ten shilling from him. Unfortunately for him his picture in the paper is recognised by Pinkie a young gangster he had crossed in the past. Pinkie finds him and threatens him he flees to the pier but runs into Pinkie again on the ghost train ride and is pushed off into the sea. The other members of Pinkie's gang think he went too far but still help him cover up the crime by placing more of Fred's cards around town so that the police think the crime happened later than it did so Pinkie will have an alibi.Unfortunately one of the cards was left in a caf where it is likely that he will be recognised by the waitress. Pinkie goes to see her at it is clear that she remembers the man who left the card and she doesn't think he looks like the man who's picture appeared in the paper. Initially Pinkie thinks he can persuade her to keep quiet about things by taking her out a few times but as he fears his alibi might unravel he marries her knowing she can't be forced to testify against him. While this is going on Ivy a woman who met Fred shortly before his death is convinced that it wasn't an accident and is conducting her own investigation.The film is gripping from start to finish with a constant sense of menace whenever Pinkie is around Richard Attenborough did a great job in the role the film was also helped by Carol Marsh's portrayal of Rose the unfortunate waitress who is dragged into his life. The only real fault I can find with the film is that Pink claims to be seventeen when Attenborough was considerable older at the time and looks it. I'd certainly recommend this film and not just to those who like classic cinema it can be enjoyed by anybody who likes a gripping story.".

Both Richard Attenborough who playes Pinky and Carol Marsh are superb in their lead roles. Pinky in particular makes Harry Lime in the Third Man look like a saint. He is the absolute epitome of callous ruthless evilness. The scene on the pier at the end of the film is just sensational. Apparently the filmakers changed the ending from that intended by Graham Greene. Would be interesting to see the film with Greene's original intended ending. A very worthy 8 or 9 out of 10.

	schema:reviewBody "THE BOY CRIED ' WOLF' 'WOLF' SEVERAL TIMES AND EACH TIME THE PEOPLE CAME TO HELP HIM THEY FOUND THERE WASN'T ANY 'WOLF' .Aesop's FablesRKO certainly lived up to its reputation as the finest creators of Film Noir with this taut and suspenseful thriller made in 1947. Held back for some reason by Howard Hughes until a 1949 release THE WINDOW was based on a story by Cornell Woolrich that became a splendid screenplay by Mel Dinelli. Photographed in stunning crisp Monochrome by William Steiner it was directed with unrivaled regard to tension and impact by Ted Tetzlaff. With no marquee names to speak of and costing a modest sum to produce on the streets of New York's Lower East Side the picture was a great success with both critics and public alike.The story of THE WINDOW concerns a 10 year boy Tommy Woodry Bobby Driscoll who just loves to spin yarns and tell tall tales. He lives in a modest apartment with his parents Arthur Kennedy and Barbara Hale in the lower East Side of New York city where his playground is the dilapidated tenements that surround him. One warm night he awakens and because of the heat takes his pillow out on to the fire escape to sleep. Here he witnesses a murder under the window shade of an adjoining apartment. But being the great story teller he is no one will believe him. No one that is except the killers themselves Paul Stewart and Ruth Roman who now must find a way to silence the boy. From here on the film never lets up. It becomes a white knuckle ride as Tommy tries to escape the killers clutches down alley ways and across the dodgy rooftops of dangerous tenements. The picture ends with one of the killers falling to his death and Tommy being reunited with his parents who finally believe him. Now he makes a solemn promise never to cry 'Wolf' again.Adding greatly to the thrills is the marvellous music score by RKO's Noir composer in residence Roy Webb. With a terrific main theme heard in its broadest form under the titles there is also some splendid eerie music for the stalking scenes and exciting action cues for the chase sequences.But there is little doubt that the film is held tightly together and dominated by the outstanding central performance from the illfated 10 year old Bobby Driscoll. You simply cannot take your eyes off him. An amazing little actor it is a great shame he never got to have a full career in film. But it was never to be! Fate had other plans for him. He was to be plagued with bad luck for the rest of his days. First he suffered with severe acne in his teens which halted his film career. Then he was arrested and sent to jail on drugs charges. When he was released his reputation proceeded him and he was unemployable in Hollywood. Later he made a couple of stabs at supporting roles in films of no repute. But he never regained even the slightest spark of his childhood genius. With his career virtually over he became a drug abuser again. In 1968  and ironically in the same setting as his greatest success in the film THE WINDOW  two children playing found his dead body in a derelict tenement in New York's Lower East Side. He was only 31 years old. It is quite inconceivable that for someone who had demonstrated such a mighty talent should finish up unknown unclaimed and sadly come to be buried in a pauper's grave on Hart Island.".

I've purchased other legit releases only to find the packaging far superior in quality to the program. The Window features a very plausible plot set in a run down urban neighborhood full of tenements and condemned buildings. A nineyear old boy with a vivid imagination and a reputation for telling tall tales witnesses a murder by his upstairs neighbors while sleeping on the fire escape one sweltering summer night. After going to his dismissing parents then to the police without their consent he is sent on his way into a nightmarish experience. The suspenseful sequences are masterfully paced and there really isn't a slow moment in the film. I would definitely buy this film if one day it's released in commercial packaging.

Barbara Hale and Arthur Kennedy register strongly as the parents. Ruth  Roman and Paul Stewart are a chilly pair as the neighbors from hell.";

	schema:headline " A tenyearold with an overactive imagination is subjected to a night of real big city terror in 1949.";
	schema:reviewBody "The Window is a rich and underrated tale of urban terror from a tenyearold's perspective. Tommy Woodry is jolted from his innocent world of make believe games when he witnesses a murder in the middle of the night. Making the terror all the worse is that the murderers are his upstairs neighbors the Kellertons and neither the police nor his parents will believe his story.  The terror grows darker when Tommy's only protection his parents leave for the night because of shift work and family illness. The music and lighting brilliantly reflect the evil that begins with nightfall and the removal of his parents.  When the Kellertons kidnap Tommy even pretending to be his parents to fool the police bad parents replace the good ones. The Window in a way is the opposite of the classic These Three of thirteen years earlier.  In the latter the lies of a young girl Bonita Granville regarding adult wrongdoing are believed without reservation with swift and devastating consequences. The Window also nicely showcases the hard life of the working class in 1949 the only telephone is at the drug store and the apartments are cramped and dilapidated with no modern appliances. Paul Stewart as Joe Kellerton plays his villainous role with a cool almost smug arrogance while Bobby Driscoll as Tommy expertly handles the role of an innocent child drawn into the gritty ugliness of urban violence. The movie maintains a fast pace with total suspense all the way to the nailbiting end and every second of it is worth watching.".

No need to dwell here on the consensus strong points.Seeing this taut little thriller in a small western town when I was 10 not only scared the heck out of me but influenced my perception of urban life for years to come. Seeing the film again 60 years later I'm impressed with producer Dore Schary's insistence on the grimness of the tenements at least by later suburban standards. There's no attempt to glamorize or even varnish the family's dingy cramped flat. Whether on NY location or on an RKO sound stage the lighting remains dark and oppressive. Of course that not only heightens the noirish atmosphere but also lends an uncommon degree of realism to the family's working class environment. After all Dad works the nightshift while Mom helps with the extended family leaving little Tommy home alone. And that I believe amounts to more than just a handy plot device. And get a load of the onlocation ruins where the kids play at the beginninglooks like something out of postwar Europe. No wonder MGM went after Schary in an effort to become more socially relevant in postAndy Hardy America. There may be a lot of Hollywood in the melodrama itself but the look and feel is definitely not Hollywood of the time. What a fine little film that's still edgeoftheseat excitement.

	schema:reviewBody "The story of the fall of the career of Bobby Driscoll sort of puts a downer effect on all of his films. In the late 1940s and early 1950s Driscoll had a remarkably effective movie career including the starring role in this classic film noir and roles in TREASURE ISLAND and LONG JOHN SILVER with Robert Newton and the voice of PETER PAN in the Disney cartoon. His drug addiction and lonely death were a tragic waste of a talented actor.THE WINDOW is one of those unexpected classic films that were made without vast publicity campaigns or expense with a simple and good cast involved and a good script. It also has a classic pedigree going back to the fables of Aesop. It is a variant on the story of the boy that cried wolf.Driscoll plays a lively little boy with a vivid imagination. His parents Arthur Kennedy and Barbara Hale are living in a lower class  working class district in a city. Kennedy has a job that takes him out of the house at night. In fact this is a film that clings to the night.Driscoll happens to tell a whopper of a lie and it blows up in his face because it embarrasses his parents. So his reputation for telling the truth has been compromised. While sleeping on the fire estate of his home at night he faces the apartment of Paul Stewart and his wife Ruth Roman. Stewart has a business associate over at his apartment gets into a quarrel and kills the associate. Unfortunately Driscoll sees this  but equally unfortunate Stewart sees that Driscoll witnessed it. So follows a long involved cat and mouse game with Stewart covering up traces of the murder with Roman's assistance and at the same time doing everything he can to dismiss Driscoll's claims of the murder as just his silly overimagination again. As Kennedy and Hale are halfinclined to believe this they too refuse to listen to Driscoll's arguments. But Stewart is also aware that at some point somebody might just decide to double check Driscoll's stories especially if he remains so insistent that he is not lying. So Stewart has to find the right moment to grab this annoying kid and get rid of the only witness.There are problems though. Driscoll's youth also means he is more energetic and physically adept than Stewart. Also although Roman is helping her husband she is not really keen about killing a little boy. Finally there is also the fact that although they strongly doubt Driscoll's story Kennedy and Hale love their son and think he's a troubled little boy. Soon Kennedy's actions are gumming up Stewart's planning as well.Besides Driscoll's performance Stewart gave one of his best villains in the film being plausible on the surface but as deadly in intentions as they come. Kennedy's father is a hard working man struggling for a better life for his family and tired of his son's tall tales. But at the right moment he does start wondering if he's been just too complacent about his son's lying.The conclusion is a tense and exciting fight between Stewart and Driscoll in a deserted building. It is a first rate conclusion to this fascinating and scary film which makes us wonder how seriously do we ever take our kids and in what ways do we show it.".

His parents are portrayed the ever capable Arthur Kennedy Champion High Sierra and Barbara Hale Perry Mason. After the boy witnesses a murder his parents and the foolish police department refuse to beleive him until it is almost too late.The murderers are also wellplayed by veterans Paul Stewart and Ruth Roman who also were in 1949s Champion with Arthur Kennedy and Kirk Douglas. The husband and wife would have gotten away with murder if at not been for the young boy . The ensuing chase and scary finale are very well done. The police in this movie were so ignorant you would wonder if they did not inspire the moron cop Officer Barbrady on South Park.This fine film was actually considered to be a throwaway B movie. It turned out to be quite popular even though it only runs for 73 minutes. The young actor Bobby Driscoll received a special Oscar for his work in 1949 but soon found his acting career drying up as he aged and his life ended tragically from drug related issues in 1968 at the age of 31.".

It goes a bit too long and begins to drag the story down a bit but stay with it. Once the killers come looking for the boy Driscoll the film suddenly becomes extremely tense. In fact the tension is so strong the last 30 minutes that there are scenes you almost can't bear to watch.Storywise there are some credibility questions mainly Why would good parents  as portrayed here by Barbara Hale and Arthur Kennedy  leave their 10yearold all alone all night? But ignoring that the film is entertaining and has a good ending so I have no complaints.Driscoll does a fine job of acting as mentioned and Hale became famous for being Perry Mason's secretary on television. Kennedy is always interesting no matter what film he is in and Paul Stewart is effective as the villain.As of this writing the VHS tape is outofprint and there is no DVD available yet sad to say.

The darkness of the mood and darkness of the filming combine to counterpoint the apparent cheer of this boy in New York City creating something just short of a masterpiece. Perfect? I wish! But the best of it will blow your noir mind.The whole adventure here happens in an apartment building one of those brick 5story walkups with fire escapes on the outside. A boy sleeping on the escape because of the heat witnesses a murder. He tells his parents who don't believe him the movie opens with a summation of the Boy Who Cried Wolf. But of course the murderer's believe him and the boy is in danger.You might find this all a contrivanceand I guess it is in a way a plot too tight and compact for real lifebut it works to create genuine suspense. The characters are all very realistic from the nice regular parents who want their kid to start telling the truth to the bad couple upstairs who seem on the surface to be rather like the parents. Even the cops are just regular schmoes. The dark stairway the window nailed shut the chases through an abandoned building next door set up by the opening of the movie with a bunch of kids using it for play and endless futile persuasion by the boy who obviously means what he says all add up to for compact intense ride. And filmed with energy and such dark shadows you can't see a thing. Director Ted Tetzlaff is more known as a cinematographer including on his last film Notorious which is a masterpiece. As a director this is probably his best film and he knows how to make the cinematographers under him give him the visual richness the film in its simplicity requires. The plot carries the ideas for sure but the visuals carry the mood and intensity and that's the best of it. And there's not a wasted minuteit's practically a textbook exercise in how to direct with economy and the benefits of doing so.See it. The title doesn't inspire muchit should be called Murder in the Window or something more compellingbut the movie does indeed inspire much. See why. Oh and a really clean copy is streamable from Warner Archive which even has a free two week trial.".

Another point to add this movie is actually banned in Finland! This movie must have genuinely shocked it's original audience when it was first shown back in 1949.This is a dark movie very eerie and some scenes mount incredible depths of tension.

	schema:headline " Noone Believes A Liar";
	schema:reviewBody "The moral of Aesop's fable about the boy who cried wolf is that noone believes liars and this is exactly what happens in The Window which was based on Cornell Woolrich's short story The Boy Who Cried Murder. Murder kidnap and the plight of a child who finds himself in mortal danger are all strong elements of this tense and realistic tale which illustrates very powerfully that in moviemaking a low budget doesn't necessarily mean a low quality endproduct.Nineyearold Tommy Woodry Bobby Driscoll lives with his parents in a tenement building in New York City's Lower East Side and his habit of telling tall stories drives them to despair because nothing they can do or say seems to make any difference in terms of getting him to change his behaviour. On one occasion after Tommy had told his friends that his family were moving to Texas their landlord had called by to show prospective tenants around and Tommy's frustrated father Ed Arthur Kennedy had been left to explain that there wasn't any truth in what the landlord had heard.One hot summer night when Tommy finds it impossible to get to sleep his mother Mary Barbara Hale gives him permission to sleep out on the fire escape and so after taking his pillow up to the next level above his bedroom window he settles down to rest. A little later he wakes up and through the window adjacent to where he'd slept sees his upstairs neighbours stealing money from the pocket of a drunken seaman and then stabbing him to death with a pair of scissors. When he tells his mother what he'd seen she doesn't believe him and suggests that he'd had a nightmare. When Tommy plucks up courage to report the matter to the police they too treat what he says with great scepticism.When Tommy's mother becomes aware that he'd reported the matter to the police she's so incensed that she compels him to apologise to their neighbours for the terrible things he'd said about them and it's only then that they realize that there was a witness to their crime and Tommy becomes terrified because he knows he's in grave danger. From that point on Joe Paul Stewart and Jean Ruth Roman Kellerson pursue Tommy relentlessly with a view to permanently eliminating the threat that he poses to their futures.It's interesting to see in this movie how differently children were treated in the late1940s because although Tommy had kind parents they were relaxed about the dangerous locations he played in considered it quite acceptable to leave him on his own in their apartment overnight and also had no qualms about locking him up in his room. The police also disbelieve him twice and on the occasion when he seeks help from a street cop because he's trapped in the back of a taxi with the Kellersons the officer tells him a good lickin' never hurt anybody boy my old man used to give me enough of them when I was a kid. Similarly it's surprising to see that during the same period  it was not considered particularly shocking to show a man with his wife's complicity casually knocking a child unconscious simply because he was being a bit difficult.The Window which provided Cornell Woolrich with the inspiration for Rear Window is well written and ends with an exciting dangerous and very welldirected chase through an abandoned building. The cinematography is also very effective in emphasising the claustrophobic nature of many of the locations and the acting is excellent throughout. Arthur Kennedy's portrayal of Tommy's father is remarkably subtle and strong and Bobby Driscoll in a role for which he received a special Oscar is simply amazing because he's just so natural expressive and believable. It's no exaggeration to say that his must be one of the greatestever screen performances by any child actor.".

With this in mind the second half makes amends with a number of solid suspense touches often tinged with irony  such as the incident when a letter arrives necessitating Hales absence from the house which would leave Driscoll all alone since Kennedy works nights the boy believes it to have been sent expressly by the villains but it turns out to be genuine. Similarly at his wits end the boy decides to run away but soon after hears a key turning in the lock of their front door  fully expecting Stewart to appear the caller emerges to be his own father who was worried about the boy and has come home to literally bar Driscoll inside his room! then when the neighbor really does show up he even helps him unbeknownst to the boy to come out of confinementso that he can deal with him!

The small boy is brilliant and the enclosed community where it is set is brilliant and creepy. It was one of those films where you don't want to blink as it is truly unpredictable the most gripping film i have ever seen and incredibly scary. The film is only about an hour long and this adds to the tension scenes are not prolonged and suspicion and fear are created with a fast pace and an urgency and despair of the boy. This is a film worth watching as it is different from the big budget special effects thrillers. it creates fear through the intensity of the boy and his parents fear of his sanity.".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this film for the first time on BBC at 2 this morning and was very impressed. Some very fine acting by all the cast and and a good believable terrifying story. Hollywood should have a good look at these old RKO movies and see how superior they are to the rubbish that is being dished out today. Bobby Driscol played an excellent role as the young boy and it was nice to see Arther Kennedy play a good guy. The black and white photography added to the suspense. Of course in latter years there have been similar stories filmed for example Eye Witness with Mark Lester and Susan George and Witness with Harrison Ford. All very good in their own right. A must for fans of a good old fashioned thriller. Kevin Thomas.".

	schema:reviewBody "Only problem is there is no mystery in the film. I recently discovered that The Window was filmed in New York City in November 1948 when Bobby Driscoll was 10. In the spring of 1948 billionaire Howard Hughes bought RKO Studios. His first action was to fire Studio Head Dore Schary because he was a Hollywood liberal. Schary went to MGM where he succeeded Louis B. Mayer. He enjoyed great success there. His second decision was to shelve The Window for being worthless garbage. It had been one of Dore Schary's pet projects. The movie sat on the shelf for nearly two years finally when the studio was short of films to release Howard Hughes was talked into releasing The Window. Instead it became the surprise hit of the year. A B movie which was supposed to make back expenses and a small profit became a huge top ten hit and RKO's 1 movie of the year. And all the credit went to Bobby Driscoll. His terrifying portrayal of Tommy Woodry was one of them most intense ever caught on film he went on to win an Oscar at the Academy Awards Ceremony at The Pantages Theatregenerously donated for the occasion by Howard Hughes after the Shrine Auditorium proved to small. Bobby was very convincing as the boy who witnesses a murder but can't get anyone to believe him....except the murderers. Bobby's character is viewed as a teller of tall tales because of his vivid imagination. Tthe one time he tells the unvarnished truth he is seen as a liar it that isn't irony then irony doesn't exist. Cornell Woolrich the great film noir novelist based the story on The Boy Who Cried Wolf. Nobody much less one tenyearold boy has ever been more alone than Bobby Driscoll's Tommy Woodry. More a psychological terror than mystery The Window is as intense a movie as has ever come out of Hollywood. By using a tenyearold boy's point of view when that boy is also the object of the murderer's mechanations Ted Tetzlaff the film's director has let his audience into one boy's nightmare.

Steiner. Stars Bobby Driscoll Ruth Roman Barbara Hale Arthur Kennedy and Paul Stewart. A unique Noir Thriller. A Family Noir. A Kid's Noir. But not just any kid the kid who was a denizen of an decaying urban rat warren in a city that was constantly regenerating. A city before the Manhattan el's were torn down before TV before airconditioning where clothes were dried on clothes lines where playgrounds were winding back alleys tar beach roof tops jungle jim fire escapes and condemned buildings that became clubhouses forts or whatever you may imagine. The real habitats of urban man circa 1948 apartment  street hall  alley sidewalk  pavement steel  earth inside  outside light  dark. What really hits home with this film is its realistic telling of the tale from Tommy's POV Bobby Driscoll. Any viewer with an urban background will find some touchstones to his own childhood or to the childhood stories of his parents. I still remember trying to sleep on hot humid summer nights in a second story apartment where thanks to a corner bedroom and two open windows any slight cross breeze brought relief. But it also provided the city lullabies of traffic distant and near the rattle of the Connecting RR winding off the Hell Gate Bridge the faint roar of the sunken Grand Central. Nature provided the rustle of a sycamore from a breeze or the patter of rain on it's leaves. My best friend who lived in a bigger apartment house actually did sleep out on the fire escape to cool off with an el down the block. The film begins brilliantly with one of Tommy's fantasies instantly drawing us in to his world. We see a condemned building we see black window lying face down we see Tommy. He awakens looking somewhat in pain clutching his chest. A child in distress. Crawling forward he grabs a cap gun and we are brought to reality. Tommy is fantasizing playingacting out a shot cowboy crawling in a hayloft to the haydoor from where he spots the gang playing cards. He shoots and his older buddies ignore him a new game has replaced the one Tommy was still playing and a fire truck siren from the street trumps even that. As Tommy makes his way to his street urchin buddies we follow the relatively benign maze like cinematic urban landscape that duplicates in reverse a final reckoning that taking place in the dead of night turns it all very noirish and frightening murderous silhouettes on window shades illumination stabbed by slanting shadows. The city especially in this film is given equal billing. William O. Steiner cinematography a native New Yorker along with two of the three assistant directors informs the visual compositions with a loving and knowing familiarity. Interiors studio probably Art Direction by Italian born Sam Corso native New Yorker Albert S. D'Agostino and Kansian Walter E. Keller looks flawless. All performances are top notch. Bobby Driscoll was incredibly talented. He's thoroughly believable as Tommy. All his interactions and reactions with his peers with his parents especially his father Ed Arthur Kennedy with his neighbors and with the police as he tries to convince them that he's telling the truth ring clear. Barbara Hale and Arthur Kennedy are excellent as Tommy's doubting parents ratcheting up the tensionhorror level every time they attempt to reason with or placate Tommy's accusations with the kind of statements most parents faced with the same situation would make. They even make Tommy confront the upstairs neighbors the Kellerson's. Joe Kellerson and Jean Kellerson are one of the most despicable couples in noir. Their grift is for looker Jean Ruth Roman to lure single men to their apartment probably for sex where she slips them knockout drops Joe Paul Stewart then rolls them for their doe and dumps them in an alley. On a hot  humid night Tommy can't sleep he wakes his mother Mary Woodry Barbara Hale and asks if he can sleep out on the fire escape where it would be cooler she says sure but be careful. Laying out in the sweltering evening with his pillow Tommy sees the towels hanging from the Kellerson's clothesline billow in a breeze a breeze that doesn't reach down enough to give Tommy relief so like any resourceful kid Tommy grabs his pillow and climbs up to the Kellerson's landing to fall asleep there. He's awakened both by a shaft of light spilling across his face from the space between the bottom of a pull shade and the window sill and the sounds of a grift going murderously wrong. Its a beautifully filmed sequence where the action is obscured partially silhouetted by the shade and vividly focused through the slot. Though I've never read the Cornell Woolrich short story I have read that the story is even gorier. Lots of great sequences watch for the police station cat. The original music score by Roy Webb even includes a leitmotif for Tommy. Great New York Noir 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "I didn't recognize Esther Williams when I saw her with her hair down and had to look here to see who the actress was...what a beautiful woman! And the costumes were wonderful along with the scenery of Yosemite making this movie the perfect diversion for a lazy Sunday afternoon. The plot was a bit slow and at today's standards left a lot to the imagination however the innocence of postWWII romance made this an absolutely charming tale. Van Johnson was good as always in my opinion but the tenor actually stole the show and provided the perfect sounding board for both characters so that we could see that they weren't really philanderers  just caught up in a difficult situation. My husband and I both enjoyed this movie and I got a lot of great costume ideas as well! I recommend this movie to anyone who is nostalgic for a simpler time and doesn't want to have to think too much  just watch and be entertained!".

And the costumes were wonderful along with the scenery of Yosemite making this movie the perfect diversion for a lazy Sunday afternoon. The plot was a bit slow and at today's standards left a lot to the imagination however the innocence of postWWII romance made this an absolutely charming tale.

	schema:headline " Leaving Esther On Their Honeymoon What a Maroon";
	schema:reviewBody "For 1945 with the Code firmly in place this film was quite daring in its subject matter. But the Esther Williams audience only wanted to see Esther in a bathing suit in or out of the water and Thrill of a Romance gave the viewer plenty of both.Esther is a swimming instructor at a public pool in Los Angeles and driving by one day is Howard Hughes like tycoon Carleton G. Young. He puts on quite the campaign and they wed. But Young is far more interested in business and while at a resort hotel on their honeymoon Carleton gets called away to Washington on a big deal. We know what his priorities are. So Esther is an unconsummated bride alone on her honeymoon when up pops war hero Van Johnson. So for a week she and Van keep each other company and look pretty sad all the while.Now Thrill of a Romance was not advertised to be Hamlet but I found the premise here to be way to silly. But with lots of shots of Esther wet and dry and music by Tommy Dorsey's Orchestra and Lauritz Melchior of the Metropolitan Opera we had a whole lot of music of every taste. A highlight is a drum solo by Buddy Rich who after Frank Sinatra left as the band's vocalist was Dorsey's main attraction.Young Jerry Scott who plays Lyonel a bellboy at the hotel gives a nice lyric tenor interpretation of Because which that year was revived in a big hit record by Perry Como. Speaking of Sinatra he recorded a song written for this film I Should Care which was authored by his personal arranger Axel Stordahl and Sammy Cahn. Also sold a few platters back in the day. Melchior sung a wide range of both classical and popular tunes. And he sort of functioned in the role of a father confessor to both Johnson and Williams. Had this been done at Warner Brothers Melchior's part would have been played by S.Z. Sakall. Melchior even had the cheeks for it.It's a nice film maybe a little too light and too silly for today's audience. But Esther Williams fans got what they wanted.".

	schema:reviewBody "An exceptionally lovely film offering a wide spectrum of tastes in music viz.the best of the big band era Tommy Dorsey along with the Metropolitan Opera's greatest Heldentenor Lauritz Melchior. The plot while rather predictable is far from boring and stars Esther Williams doing her thing along with one of the biggest male heart throbs of the time Van Johnson. What a delight in this year of 2006 to see a Hollywood production without a leftist twist a secret agenda or graphic sex scenes seconds after the lovers first meet. It's just pure entertainment on an emotionally mature level. Sadly this film will be seen as trite and somewhat saccharine by most of today's viewers.

	onyx:emotionText "An exceptionally lovely film offering a wide spectrum of tastes in music viz.the best of the big band era Tommy Dorsey along with the Metropolitan Opera's greatest Heldentenor Lauritz Melchior. The plot while rather predictable is far from boring and stars Esther Williams doing her thing along with one of the biggest male heart throbs of the time Van Johnson. What a delight in this year of 2006 to see a Hollywood production without a leftist twist a secret agenda or graphic sex scenes seconds after the lovers first meet. It's just pure entertainment on an emotionally mature level. Sadly this film will be seen as trite and somewhat saccharine by most of today's viewers.

I am a fan of hers and I would have been content with that. Immediately though the film has her getting married to an unromantic businessman who is no more a leading man than Robert Q. Lewis. Gee I wonder where this is going? They go to a resort for their honeymoon and he immediately leaves for a business meeting on the east coast leaving poor Esther all alone with nothing to do except maybe meet the GI Van Johnson who has the room and balcony next to hers. There is no point in describing the rest of the plot. It is interrupted every minute or so by a comedy bit or a musical number.My advice is to ignore the plot and just watch the film for the musical numbers and the occasional shots of the glorious Ms. Williams that are in focus. Unfortunately the musical interludes are often abbreviated. But there are many of them.Enjoy Tommy Dorsey and his band. They somehow pop up everywhere. Buddy Rich delivers a killer drum solo thatthough it is briefshows why he was the best.15yearold Helene Stanley portrays Dorsey's daughter Susan who plays piano and sings with some serious chops. Too bad they did not let play more jive. Interesting fact later she would marry Johnny Stompanato.A young boy named Jerry Scott sings Please Don't Say No Say Maybe for just a few bars before they cut him off and have him sing the less enjoyable Because. Apparently this would be Jerry's only film appearance.Lauritz Melchoir displays his serious operatic talents in four or five musical numbers.The plot is sappy silly and requires no acting skills. Jettison any concern for it and you can enjoy the musical treats of Thrill of a Romance. In wartime USA I am sure the GIs overseas loved this piece of fluff. And in their absence American women somehow found Van Johnson appealing. But some of the gushing reviews for this film on IMDb are I feel unfathomable.".

	schema:reviewBody "Esther Williams is a beautiful sweet old fashioned girl from Hollywood's golden age. Her specialties have been those glamorous spectacular water ballet numbers but she doesn't have much of one in this film though.My very favorite Esther swimming water ballets are in Million dollar mermaid  This time for keeps and Bathing beauty. But I've enjoyed all of them. I also loved Esther's skiing show in Easy to loveThis film is more of just a romance but a good one. Esther has just gotton married and they take their honeymoon to a resort at Yosemite national park. But Esther's husband leaves her on their first day of the trip to do a business deal. I don't care how good a business deal looks if it would leave me earning even a little under a million dollars I would never ditch my newly married wife on our honeymoon. When he leaves Esther is sobbing on her hotel room balcony and is overheard by Van Johnson in the room next door. They start talking they hit it off and start spending time together. And Esther who was an Olympic swimmer in real life even teaches Van how to swim. There are some good supporting characters here. Professional opera singer Lauritz Melchior who is singing for the hotel struggles humorously to stay on a diet willing to do almost anything for a steak potatoes and a beer including singing for it which gets him close but not quite. Melchior sings a very good song with Esther and others in a bar Viva la Compangnie while drinking. Esther looked so sweet next to him there you can see that she and Melchior are just wanting to drink and have fun unlike the stuffed shirt husband who leaves their vacation to work after just one phone call. I also kinda liked the scene where Melchior with that other guy who was a doctor gives in from the diet and simply enjoys himself endulging himself with food and beer while singing about it. I agree let loose and enjoy life eat and drink what you want if it feels good. Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra provide the background music and a girl about 9 or 10 plays Lizts Hungarian Rhapsody on the piano almost as good as Franz Liszt. Then she jazzes it up and Dorsey plays the trombone and she starts singing. What talent she had in both piano and singing. I wonder what became of her after this film. Then later she has to start the music up of a song Lauritz sings because the rest of the orchestra doesn't know it. There's a lot of feel good chemistry between Esther and Van and you know SPOILER they'll end up together. Well I sure hope so because I would feel sorry for Esther if she was dumb enough to go back to that neglectful jerk husband of hers. Anyway I'm glad Van gets with Esther. That's what he really deserved.".

There was something offputting about this guy from the first time I saw him. He really crept me out. The romance is tepid and I often found myself waiting for the next musical number some of which are by Tommy Dorsey's orchestra which I like and others are opera which I didn't like.

Williams and Johnson make an ideal movie couple and of course we know they'll end up together even if it takes an hour and a half. It's still early in our mermaid's career so there's little signature water ballet but she does do some acrobatic diving that almost gave this old guy a backache. And surprise operatic tenor Melchior not only does some highbrow singing but shows he can handle dialog too. It's the kind of jocular cupid role that Cuddles Szakall usually got in these romantic bonbons. Actually I was hoping for more featured swing numbers form Dorsey's band but at least Buddy Rich gets a mindbending drum solo.

Tommy Dorsey gets some good numbers with his band but the true star of the picture much more important than his billing would lead you to believe is Metropolitan Opera tenor Lauritz Melchior. At this point Melchior was winding down his career at the Met  he would be one of the old timers to go when Rudolf Bing arrived and did a lot of house cleaning. And perhaps the performances he was giving there were no longer what they should have been. But in this movie he really steals the show. He plays an overweight tenor a part that fitted him to a T with an affability and sense of humor that make him seem completely at ease on the screen unlike too many of his Met colleagues who had taken their turns in Hollywood. He also sings with a voice that is still rock solid. And he has a lot of numbers from his classical standards like Grieg's Ich liebe dich and Vesti la giubba to some pop numbers of which the best is the closing one Please don't say no say maybe. Go out to make popcorn while the plot is advancing but make sure you come back for the musical numbers!".

	schema:headline " The most human portrayal of war yet conceived";
	schema:reviewBody "Note  Potop means Deluge and is labeled such on some international covers of the film though not all.This is one of the greatest postmedieval war films yet unfortunately is largely ignored by audiences today.  Perhaps it is because this is Polish production based on a historical Polish novel.  However although the story is based vaguely on Polish history nearly all of the characters except for the Polish king  some members of Polish aristocracy are fictional.  That is not to say the events or characters are untrue to life  just the opposite they are wonderful representations of people thrust into universal situations of desperation.  It is easy for anyone to identify with many of the characters depicted in the film.  Director Hoffman has created people not just characters they seem so real that one feels almost able to reach into the screen and touch them.  Another interesting factor is that they are people from all walks of life.  Unlike Kurosawa's Ran another fascinating film about postmedieval warfare the people represented on screen are not just the leaders responsible for the actual war.  Everyone from peasant folk to the highest ranking military personnel is covered  and they are all deep characters with emotions and feelings not just hordes of faceless crowds running to battle to be slaughtered.  This creates a full tapestry of characters unlike anything seen in any film of this kind.The cinematography is another factor worthy of mention especially regarding its intended relation to the depicted events.  The locations reach from breathtaking and beautiful images of Polish forests to the cold and hopeless feeling of winter.  It's interesting to note that the mood of the cinematography quite often directly reflects the mindset of the characters especially the character Andrzej Kmicic played by Daniel Olbrychski. Kmicic without a doubt the most interesting personality in the film is often a very irrational man.  He lapses quite suddenly from emotions of extreme hatred and rage to feelings of unquestionable love and the cinematography perfectly reflects this instability.  This becomes especially evident in the latter portion of the film as the Swedish army encroaches Poland and the situation becomes desperate for all the characters involved. The landscape at this point becomes desolate and cold as if the invading Swedes brought with them not only weapons of death but also the excruciating winter of the Scandinavian north.  Even the music reflects this atmosphere of desolation as is best evidenced in a scene of the Swedish army marching into Poland.  The music at this point becomes powerful to the extreme yet it is a simple tune played by many instruments creating an atmosphere that conveys feelings of the freezing winter by aural means alone.Potop is flawlessly directed by Jerzy Hoffman one could say that this was his greatest achievement.  His previous film Pan Wolodyjowski based on the third part of the same trilogy of books was also wonderful but it failed to convey the chaotic and senseless nature of war as well.  With Potop Hoffman has created a masterpiece.  It is dark cruel and ruthless as war always is.  The editing supervised by Hoffman is flawless.  In 1999 Hoffman brought the first part of the Sienkewicz trilogy to screen in the form of Ogniem i Mieczem With Fire And Sword but left the editing to a young editor who tried to impress young audiences with pointless fast edits which made that film nearly unbearable to watch.  With Potop we can see a master at his best  there are a few fast edits where such editing is appropriate and many long perfectly choreographed shots that reflect both the beauty of the landscape and the desperation of the characters involved.The acting is another factor that makes this such a wonderful film.  There are so many interesting characters and excellent performances to match that it would be impossible to cover them all.  However two actors that truly stand out here are the late Tadeusz Lomnicki in the role of Michal Wolodyjowski the same role he portrayed in Pan Wolodyjowski and of course Daniel Olbrychski as the erratic Andrzej Kmicic.  The only oddity here is that Daniel Olbrychski actually appears in all three parts of the trilogy as three very different characters.  In Pan Wolodyjowski he plays the evil Azja Tuhajbejowicz and in Ogniem i Mieczem he is Azja's father TuhajBej.  This makes some sense in terms of the first and third part of the trilogy since we'd expect the son to look a little like his father but in Potop he plays a Polish noble.  This can be a little distracting when you see all parts of the trilogy yet it is impossible to deny that Daniel Olbrychski is one of the best actors of the last three decades so it's no surprise that Hoffman wanted Olbrychski to appear in all three parts of the trilogy.Overall this is one of the greatest war films of all time.  Because of its ability to create real humans out of characters it is also a fine film compared to any genre.  Unless you are deathly afraid of subtitles you will surely agree.  War is hell and this film represents that perfectly! Highly recommended.".

Jerzy Hoffman could have dreamed at the best of that kind of money for his film and still he made one of the best movies in history of cinema and the best in the history of Polish cinema.";

	schema:reviewBody "Potop The Deluge is the film that every Pole knows almost by heart. It is shown on TV every year either at Christmas time or at Easter  and yet we watch it over and over again and we are never bored with it. There are many reasons for it like superb acting by some of the greatest Polish actors especially by Olbrychski as Kmicic although I personally don't like him very much in his other roles he just WAS Kmicic  passionate quicktempered desperately in love with Olenka and not too politically wise and the gripping story covering a tragic period in the history of my nation that is the Swedish deluge as we call it  the 17th century war between Poland and Sweden when Swedish armies invaded our land and some noble families betrayed the Polish king and accepted Gustavus Karolus.One of the strongest elements of the film is the care with which the director and the whole crew depicted the 17th century Poland with the costumes traditions and food. As an anecdote I can tell you that at the time the average family saw ham only at Christmas and never in such amounts as you can see in the film  and yet what you see on the table in the picture is real hams game and poultry...The devotion and passion of all the crew members show in the film  and that is why it involves us the viewers even after so many years. But the most important thing is that whether you know Polish history or not you will find in the movie some general truths about war about how it influences peoples' lives and how the sacrifice of one man can change the course of history. It will also tell you something about the Poles  yes we are rebellious we are quarrelsome and yet we are ready to die for things that are sacred to us  like the abbey in Czestochowa the home of the national treasure the painting of Madonna the Queen of Poland.So watch it and enjoy  it's on my personal list of top 10 films of all times all nations.".

For money for pleasure for revenge  he doesn't care why he kills or how  . The film deals with a little boy named Johnny whose daddy is shot by soldiers. He then is adopted by a sheriff Jose Bodalo and seeks vengeance . Many years later he aware how to shoot as he kills any army soldier he meets for blind vendetta . The general of the local fort assigns a dangerous mission to jailed lieutenant Garringo Anthony Steffen to resolve the murderous who kills cavalry soldiers . As Garringo carries out his assignment by means of a cruel manner  as the officer executes a slaughter and atrocity  he pulls off a singlehandedly revenge slashes  ravages and kills each person involved in the massacre . He is relentless in his vendetta  deadly in his violence . When Garringo find out the executioner of the grisly killings occurs the predictable battle of wits . The conflict is simple  one between avenger Garringo against also relentless killer Johnny Peter Lee Lawrence  never hesitating to kill. It's an exciting western with breathtaking showdown between the protagonist Anthony Steffen and the enemy Peter Lee Lawrence and his hoodlums . Both of them are fine they ravage the screen they jump bounds and leaps hit and run  besides receive violent punches kicks  and ultimately takes places a breathtaking showdown . This exciting western contains a story full of violence  good dramatic pace and slick direction . Enjoyable ChorizoSpaghetti Western mostly produced by Spain and Italian secondary participation  it follows the Sergio Leone wake  including closeup  zooms  choreographic duels and no being proceeded in American style . The film packs action  shootouts  drama  high bodycount and it's fast moving and quite entertaining . It's a thrilling western with spectacular outdoors and breathtaking confrontation among heartless protagonists  Anthony Steffen and Peter Lee Lawrence  and both of them against the Raf Baldasarre and his underlings . Acceptable action sequences with rousing crossfire and spectacularly bloody shootouts . Charismatic performance for whole casting . The notorious Spaghetti actor  Anthony Steffen is good in his usual tough role . photo Anthony Steffen may be a name best remembered by Spaghetti Western aficionados but in his day from the mid'60s to the early '70s Steffen was one of the most popular actors of the genre  at the time cheap B movies now revered cult classics. The handsome Italianborn  actually at the Brazilian embassy in Rome  Antonio Luiz de Teff von Hoonholtz began working in films as a studio messenger for Vittorio De Sica. From there Steffen began acting in swordandsandal epics later moving onto the Western genre where he found his niche. Unlike fellow Spaghetti star Clint Eastwood however Steffen never became a top international boxoffice attraction. Fantastic performance by the always great Jose Bodalo in a likable role  famous for Django he subsequently would play similar characters  furthermore the slimy menacing outlaw played by Ralf Baldassarre here in his ordinary role as bandit and in a cruelly baddie character . There appears as habitual secondaries in SpanishItalian Western such as Lorenzo Robledo Luis Induni  Luis Barboo  Tito Garcia  Barta Barry Alfonso Rojas Frank Braa who still continues playing  and of course  Carlos Romero Marchent  Joaquin and Rafael's brother who used to work in their films . The musician Marcello Giombini composes a nice soundtrack  well conducted  this turns out to be one of the most memorable parts of the movie  as it's plenty of enjoyable sounds and haunting musical background and with agreeable leitmotif . Very nice cinematography including good sets filmed on locations in Cuenca CastillaLa Mancha Madrid  La Pedriza Soria Castilla y Len Spain and Rome Lazio Italy .The motion picture was professionally directed and in personal style by Rafael Romero Marchent at his best and written by his brother Joaquin Romero Marchent. Rafael is an expert writer and director of Spaghetti Western as proved in Two crosses on Danger Pass Cry for revenge and Two guns for two twins . While his brother Joaquin Marchent is deemed the Paella Western's best director  his first film was El Coyote and the sequel titled Revenge of Coyote shot in Mexico  after that  he filmed The shadow of Zorro and Revenge of Zorro he went go directing Western as  Riding to death   Adventures in the West  Three good men Sabor Venganza  and the most popular and violent Condenados a Vivir . Plus  he wrote for his brother Rafael Romero Marchent the followings Western  Manos Torpes Ocaso Un Pistolero and Garringo . Rating  Passable and acceptable  though contains some flaws and gaps and excessive zooms . Worthwhile watching for the Spaghetti Western aficionados .".

Unfortunately this Robin Hood gets overlooked next to Errol Flynn's and the silent with Douglas Fairbanks Sr. but it has enough merit to stand on its own.Richard Todd is a dashing Robin Hood and he was at the height of his career when he did this film for Walt Disney. Todd was a fine performer and should have had a much bigger career than he did.The cast is filled out with a fine group of British performers. Two in my opinion really stand out. Peter Finch gets his first real exposure to American audiences as the villainous Sheriff of Nottingham. He probably had the biggest career of all the cast members.Secondly the booming James Robertson Justice as Little John is never bad in any film he was ever in. The classic battle between Robin Hood and Little John with staffs on a log bridge was never done better.During the 1950s this version also had competition from television where Richard Greene had a successful series for about seven years. The TV series was a good one but this film doesn't have to yield to it either.A fine adventure film the kind just not being made any more.".

The cast is solid led by the energetic and charismatic Richard Todd as Robin Hood.This version has a few features not commonly found in Robin Hood films. Eleanor of Aquitaine the Queen of England and mother to both King Richard and Prince John is a major supporting character and is played by veteran actress Martita Hunt.  The reallife Eleanor is one of the most famous and powerful women of medieval English history and one that is unfortunately only rarely portrayed in film.  Another historic figure that is represented is the Archbishop of Canterbury played by Antony Eustral.  Absent from this version is the traditional conflict between Normans and Saxons but there is plenty of evildoing on the part of Prince John and the Sheriff of Nottingham for Robin to deal with.This rousing adventure is not to be missed particularly by those who profess to have an interest in classic adventure.  Don't let the association with Walt Disney Studios fool you.  Though the film isn't brutally violent there is sufficient 1950s death and mayhem to satisfy most fans of the genre.".

	schema:reviewBody "Now this is actually worth going to some trouble to see. Probably not to everyone's taste  the opening sequence with a nimblefooted and saturnine AlanaDale strumming the themesong ballad will sort out the sheep from the goats of those who simply can't stand this sort of thing  but despite the liveaction Disney label it stands up well amongst all its predecessors and successors.It steers a skillful and essential line between tendentious overseriousness and pieintheface humour and contrives a fresh view on the familiar setpieces  the shivered arrow on the bull'seye Friar Tuck and the river crossing the recruitment of Little John  with unusually a sizable part for the formidable Eleanor of Aquitaine as the mother of the King and Prince John. In the title role Richard Todd makes a charming curlyheaded rogue whose merry eyes betray his identity beneath the most enveloping of disguises and he brings the necessary charisma and impudence to the character this is the recognisable Robin Hood of legend whom men follow for freedom and for the fun of it. A little easygoing perhaps with little of the passion against injustice that flashes beneath the laughter of Errol Flynn but this is Disney after all.Joan Rice is a spitfire wilful Marian whose involvement is plausibly scripted without any anachronism she also provides a couple of the best moments in the film whether belabouring Robin on her fellowtravellers' behalf or silencing him with an athletic embrace at the end. James Hayter as Friar Tuck and Peter Finch as the blackavised Sheriff of Nottingham also give memorable performances  and could that really have been avuncular Hubert Gregg of all people convincing us as Prince John?My main source of irritation about this film lay in some of the archery embellishments. Every arrowshot we see zips past with the whine of a ricocheted bullet presumably in order to make the fights sound more exciting in the absence of gunfire and the system of signalling by firing colourcoded arrows in relays at one another seemed not only out of place but highly risky credibility not helped by what I surely didn't imagine as people turning round to look as they hear the arrow coming! The distinctly unpleasant fate of the forsworn Sheriff on the other hand was glossed over in suspicious silence without so much as a cry.But caveats aside the film scores well on sheer energy with a healthy dash of humour. The 1967 A Challenge for Robin Hood despite featuring Hayter as Friar Tuck again! is an overbright and sanitised Ladybird rendition the 1990 Robin Hood the nonCostner version went the other way and overdid the historical grime. The latter is the better film but neither of them has the enjoyability and spirit of the 1952 offering. This isn't on the same scale as the CurtizKeighley classic of 1938 and Todd remains an engaging boy rather than a rollicking leader of men but it perhaps comes closest to matching the verve of its illustrious predecessor.".

As can be intimated from the rating above my reaction to it was by and large a positive one to begin with the copy I acquired  even if viewed on a small TV screen  was gorgeous making this surely among the studio's most handsomelooking liveaction efforts. Another immediately striking element is the casting  modest in comparison to the earlier Warner Bros. superproduction perhaps but no less capable and more importantly fitting to each respective character Todd one of the few Robins not to sport a beard! is suitably dashing and goodnatured though lacking the athleticism of Flynn and Douglas Fairbanks before him incidentally having mentioned Fairbanks  whose 1922 ROBIN HOOD was treated with such rigor as to have the semblance of authenticity  this one too would appear to want to present the 'true' story not merely picking up from the moment King Richard  played by an unrecognizable Patrick Barr  left for the Crusades but also insisting on providing a backstory and a noble heritage for our hero  even the famous archery contest occurs prior to his having turned outlaw and what's more Robin is beaten by his own dad in it?!. Anyway to get back to Todd's fellow actors pretty Joan Rice makes for one of the youngest yet most spirited Maid Marians among the Merrie Men typically the ones to get most prominence are Little John James Robertson Justice  who else?  but with hair dyed blond! Friar Tuck James Hayter and for some odd reason fancying himself a singer in the film's corniest scene!  both of their introductions at least stick to the legend  and AllenaDale Elton Hayes whose brief cinematic career seemed to be stuck playing minstrels in historical efforts! for what it is worth the presence of the last two mentioned constitute the film's severest drawbacks to this viewer. On the side of the wrongdoers we get Hubert Gregg as a particularly sly though rather youthful Prince John and surprisingly Peter Finch as the Sheriff of Nottingham effective apart from an unbecoming coiffure  incidentally I may be watching his one other film in this vein i.e. THE DARK AVANGER aka THE WARRIORS 1955 with Errol Flynn no less this coming weekend by the way another novelty to the lore which turns up here but hardly anywhere else is that of having a benign but obviously ineffective Queen Mother a suitably regal Martita Hunt. While there is not quite the emphasis on spectacle or elaborate action setpieces we find in other versions though the drawbridge climax is undeniably thrilling the film  which at a mere 84 minutes does not run the risk of overstaying its welcome  is very entertaining for the most part and as I said looks good enough to smooth over the occasional deficiency.".

First and most obvious but hey it's pretty important Richard Todd's Robin. I fell in love with him when I saw the movie on Wonderful World of Disney I was born the year it was released 1952 and have followed his career with interest ever since. His archery and other swashbuckling actions are persuasive but not gimmicky his romantic aura is compelling but not slick his leadership qualities are authoritative and incisive but not overbearing. And he has a sense of humor! Some of the less obvious reasons I rate this film a 10 The framing device of AllanaDale and the lovely singingplaying of Elton Hayes within that I love the small unassuming sweetnatured dog who follows the minstrel wherever he goes. The dialogue and business shared by the Archbishop of Canterbury Anthony Eustrel I believe Prince John Hubert Gregg and Queen Eleanor Martita Hunt. The childhood friendship of Robin and Marian that gradually ripens into romance. Thus when she disguises herself as a page in order to seek out Robin Fitzooth to prove his loyalty to king and country her emotional stake lends sympathy and believability to her actions. The economical sceneshifting that takes Robin from his quarterstaff skirmish with Little John to his brookside battle with Friar Tuckwhich in turn leads seamlessly to an ambush by the Sheriff of Nottingham and his goons. Spoiler Alert in case another is needed! Check out the grisly but tastefully handled demise of the Sheriffgetting squashed andor bisected between an inexorably closing drawbridge and the castle wall! No matter how many times I see this film and it's been quite a few this scene always makes me rub my hands and cackle gleefully.I could cite many other reasons why I love this film but if you ask for one quality that sets it apart from every other Robin Hood film I've seenincluding one very famous and in my opinion vastly overrated supposed classicI would say Heart. As in warm true and loyal. And it will warm the hearts of viewers not jaded by overblown yet hollow swashbucklers and pompous pretentious epics.".

Thus when she disguises herself as a page in order to seek out Robin Fitzooth to prove his loyalty to king and country her emotional stake lends sympathy and believability to her actions. The economical sceneshifting that takes Robin from his quarterstaff skirmish with Little John to his brookside battle with Friar Tuckwhich in turn leads seamlessly to an ambush by the Sheriff of Nottingham and his goons. Spoiler Alert in case another is needed! Check out the grisly but tastefully handled demise of the Sheriffgetting squashed andor bisected between an inexorably closing drawbridge and the castle wall! No matter how many times I see this film and it's been quite a few this scene always makes me rub my hands and cackle gleefully.I could cite many other reasons why I love this film but if you ask for one quality that sets it apart from every other Robin Hood film I've seenincluding one very famous and in my opinion vastly overrated supposed classicI would say Heart. As in warm true and loyal. And it will warm the hearts of viewers not jaded by overblown yet hollow swashbucklers and pompous pretentious epics.";

We loved the whistling arrows warning system used in this film and we found Richard Todd a dashing swashbuckling Robin in fact we became huge fans of all his works. One of our favorites was Disney's Rob Roy The Highland Rogue actually filmed in Scotland. Disney was not a miser when it came to his pet projects and Rob Roy was one of them. The Story of Robin Hood was no exception and it was filmed on location in England even though some shots look like matte prints. The cast too was impressive with James Robertson Justice a perfect burly 'Little John' Martita Hunt as Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine James Hayter a robust 'Friar Tuck' Peter Finch as the nasty Sheriff of Nottingham Elton Hale a charming 'AllanaDale' the great Michael Hordern in a small role as 'Scathelock' and Bill Owen as 'Stutely'. The production is top notch and the film very memorable and to me very nostalgic.".

The Merrie Men This is a Disney live action movie that actually has less fluff than others and is pretty straightforward in the telling of the tale. Richard Todd plays the main character as a playful yet purposeful hero of the poor folk in the area after King Richard goes on a crusade and his brother takes advantage of his position by overtaxing everyone and trying to rid the forest of what he considers riffraffthe Forresting folk. The first culprit of his arrows is Robin's fatherthus providing the primary purpose of Robin's exile and revenge mindset initially. Quickly though the stealing from the rich and giving to the poor became a necessity for the poor folk to survive. The sheriff of Nottingham is the primary vehicle for brother Richard's type of thievery and justice and eventually Maid Marionplayed by Joan Rice finds out what's going on and begins to help the Merrie Men. This live action piece seems to be a possible guide to the later animated Disney film but some of the stronger emotional pieces were removed. I haven't viewed many of the versions of this story but this is the best I've encountered so far because you understand Mr. Hood's plight and purpose. There is a little fun to be had with the Merrie Men and Robin  Marion's teasing but primarily the completeness and clarity of the story is what makes this film work.".

Clint Walker was one who couldn't seem to make the transition which in retrospect is rather surprising.

Perhaps the glut of TV westerns in the late '50s and early '60s had something to do with it.Based on a 1957 novel Desert Guns by prolific western writer Steve Frazee Gold of the Seven Saints was the third collaboration between Clint Walker and director Gordon Douglas. Together they'd made Fort Dobbs in 1958 and Yellowstone Kelly in 1959. Gold is easily the best of the three benefitting from Joe Biroc's impressive blackandwhite photography and from the unforced camaraderie between taciturn Walker and talkative Moore. Despite their occasional squabbling one senses an abiding affection between these two and thus one can understand why the beauteous Leticia Roman can't lure either of them away. Clint's famous 48 chest is briefly on display here in all its hirsute glory when he bathes in a large barrel but it's costar Roger Moore who gets to sweat in the beefackebondage scene. Stripped to the waist and staked out on the ground Moore has strips of wet rawhide tied around his chest  strips which will shrink in the sun and thus encourage him to tell the bad guys where his gold is hidden.In Frazee's book an entire freshlycut hide is completely wrapped around the victim but doing so in the movie would probably cause the audience to go Ick! and besides it'd hide Roger Moore's bare chest from view.".

For one thing it has the unusual pairing of towering western figure Walker and lean British actor Moore sporting a grating Irish brogue.  Additionally despite continual references to pretty girls and a showy role for lifted and separated Italian actress Roman the movie is rife with homoerotic images and subtext!  Walker and Moore play furtrappers who have recently acquired 125 lbs of gold.  Once word gets out that they're packing it across the desert villains come out from under every rock to steal it.  The pair have a sort of Batman and Robin dynamic with Moore referred to as kid by Walker even though they are only months apart in age trying hard to be a good partner but inevitably running into trouble. Walker as the wiser and stronger hero must come to his rescue.  Walker's first appearance in the film presents him as a monument that nearly dwarfs the surrounding Utah scenery.  His beefy body is regularly placed in various GrecoRoman positions.  He sprawls out under a rock for a nap while Moore lays his head at his feet looking upward.  Later in a scene with Wills as a questionable doctor who's come to get in on the gold Walker wields a phallic gun between his legs.  He tells Wills that there is no one besides Moore who he'd rather have my back.  When the trio lands at Middleton's hacienda Walker in the film's highlight takes a bath in a huge barrel and is scrubbed down by Roman as Moore looks on longingly supposedly due to buttswinging Roman but the audience knows better!  A publicity shot for the film actually shows Moore spooning in this tub with Walker snugly behind him!  This probably staged just for fun shot isn't in the movie.  If it had been the flick would have outgrossed The Guns of Navarone that year! A later shot of an ostensibly nude Walker asleep on his bunk has him lit like an archangel taking a nap.  By now Walker has crossed the line into the gay cowboy fantasy stratosphere!  By the time Moore is stripped to the waist and tied to a rock in another Batmanesque move...one can almost hear an announcer ominously asking what will happen to our Boy Wonder waiting for Walker to come and rescue him Walker comes upon three skinnydipping varmints and then is asked to get on his belly with his granite behind on display the film has taken on a whole new aspect.  Moore who should never be allowed to sing on film again ekes out the final ditty something to the effect of if marriage is in store I'm outta here as the duo rides off together contentedly.  The one major drawback to the film is its lack of color.  The striking scenery and Walker's polar blue eyes deserved to be shot in vivid Technicolor.  This was director Douglas' third time at bat with Walker so he knew the value of Walker's treasure chest.  Did Walker realize his own appeal and understand the way he was being presented?  His gentle aw shucks personality in interviews would suggest not.  Thank God however that he exists on celluloid for later generations to appreciate.".

	schema:reviewBody "Too bad this movie was filmed in color. I think the visuals would have been magnificent and improved the overall acceptance of this movie. Basically it's a poor man's version of The Treasure of Sierra Madre. The movie has a fine cast that features Clint Walker a very young Roger Moore Chill Wills the venerable Joe Fuller company actor Gene Evans and the always first rate Robert Middleton...who was really kind of wasted in this one. Walker and Moore are fur traders turned gold miners...that strike the big one. They need another pack horse to lug in their haul...and this is how the trouble starts when Moore pays with a gold nugget as he is caught trying to steal a horse. What then happens the boys try to bring in their haul...followed by some ominous characters led by Evans. The two are trapped and attacked by Evans crew..when Wills enters to save the day as a doctor gunslinger gun for hire...If you could put things in perspective for the comparative between Treasure Clint would be the Tim Holt character Moore Bogey's Fred C Dobbs...with less psychological traits...you could tell they wanted to play that paranoid card with Moore but Douglas must have decided to downscale that angle. Wills would be the Walter Huston character Middleton the Mexican bandito...and Evans the more deceptive murderous twist on the theme.Anyway the movie was very good and worthwhile viewing. The location shooting added to the movie and in color would have been glorious. For a Warner Bros movie that often reeked of other films footage spliced in to cut costs this was a darn good western. Highly recommend seeing. I gave it a 710".

	onyx:emotionText "Too bad this movie was filmed in color. I think the visuals would have been magnificent and improved the overall acceptance of this movie. Basically it's a poor man's version of The Treasure of Sierra Madre. The movie has a fine cast that features Clint Walker a very young Roger Moore Chill Wills the venerable Joe Fuller company actor Gene Evans and the always first rate Robert Middleton...who was really kind of wasted in this one. Walker and Moore are fur traders turned gold miners...that strike the big one. They need another pack horse to lug in their haul...and this is how the trouble starts when Moore pays with a gold nugget as he is caught trying to steal a horse. What then happens the boys try to bring in their haul...followed by some ominous characters led by Evans. The two are trapped and attacked by Evans crew..when Wills enters to save the day as a doctor gunslinger gun for hire...If you could put things in perspective for the comparative between Treasure Clint would be the Tim Holt character Moore Bogey's Fred C Dobbs...with less psychological traits...you could tell they wanted to play that paranoid card with Moore but Douglas must have decided to downscale that angle. Wills would be the Walter Huston character Middleton the Mexican bandito...and Evans the more deceptive murderous twist on the theme.Anyway the movie was very good and worthwhile viewing. The location shooting added to the movie and in color would have been glorious. For a Warner Bros movie that often reeked of other films footage spliced in to cut costs this was a darn good western. Highly recommend seeing. I gave it a 710";

Clint Walker and Robert more find 125 pounds of gold nuggets and are on the run across the desert from various factions also wanting the gold. Walker is serviceable as the lead I always thought he'd be perfectly cast as The Punisher but it's a young Roger Moore even before his breakthrough role as Simon Templar in The Saint who really brings life to the picture as a wily Irishman. It's nothing brilliant that you haven't seen before in any number of other western but it's all done well and was never boring. Cowritten by the great Leigh Brackett who's worked on everything from The Big Sleep to Rio Bravo to The Empire Strikes Back.".

	schema:reviewBody "Actor Clint Walker and seasoned sagebrush director Gordon Douglas teamed up for a third time for Gold of the Seven Saints and this time future James Bond actor Roger Moore played Walker's impetuous sidekick. Warner Brothers lensed this dusty western around scenic Moab Utah where John Ford made some of his most memorable westerns. The spectacular scenery is a treat to look at even if lenser Joseph F. Biroc had to shoot it in black and white. Walker and Moore respectively play fur trappers Jim Rainbolt and Shaun Garrett. Unlike other Walker westerns our brawny hero is cast as a peaceable fellow in this sprawling sagebrusher rather than a sixgun toting jasper. He carries a Winchester repeating rifle and never wears a sixgun cinched around his waist. Basically Walker plays Walker an imposing gent with a rich baritone voice. Meanwhile Roger Moore sports an Irish accent and his actions get Rainbolt and he in trouble in Big Sleep scenarist Leigh Brackett who derived her screenplay from the Steve Frazee western novel Desert Guns. Since I haven't read the Frazee novel I cannot attest to the fidelity of the Douglas western to its source material. Nevertheless this adventure occurs largely outdoors with an occasional set. Our heroes find themselves blessed with the discovery of 250 pounds of gold but they are short on horses. Shaun tries to steal them a horse in a nearby town but he gets caught redhanded. The Mexican vaquero who catches him agrees to release him if he will ante up some money. Reluctantly as well as desperately Shaun hands over a gold nugget and gets out of the corral with a horse and his life. The vaquero's supervisor McCracken Gene Evans of The Steel Helmet keeps him from shooting Shaun in the back. Shaun realizes the error of his ways when he reports back to his partner about the circumstances under which he acquired the horse. Throughout the remainder of this trim 88 minute oater Jim and Shaun flee from killers who would deprive them of their gold as well as their lives. The ending is reminiscent of Treasure of the Sierra Madre.".

Even Robert Middleton's hearty portrayal of Rainbolt's old Mexican friend seems a throwaway by the finale.

However where QT's films and similar triumphs like Go are explosive this one is insidiously subtle and deadpan so much so that the gradual recognition of the filmmakers' intentions will give you the shivers. The creeping revelations of the themes the dark pastels selfreferential script and straightfaced performances are reminiscent of earlier successful dark comedies like Parents and I Madman. Jones her solo dance is a knockout and Baldwin are both deadon and the director and editor never miss a beat. This is one of the best films of the 90s. by the way did anyone notice that this film opened about the same time as Headless Body in Topless Bar? quite a coincidence.".

	schema:reviewBody "In my opinion this is one of the most underrated movies of the 90s featuring one of my alltime favorite performances by the enchanting Angela Jones. It is based on a short made in 1991 about a childlike murderobsessed ColombianAmerican who takes a job as a maid...who cleans up after violent murders. Apparently Tarantino liked the short so much that he cast Jones in Pulp Fiction and produced a full length version of Curdled with Jones and William Baldwin who is surprisingly great. This is one of my favorite black comedies and easily the funniest serial killer thriller ever. Angela Jones lights up the screen with her animated facial expressions think Audrey Tautou and quirky delivery. Oh and this movie features one of the best dance sequences in a movie yes even better than Britt Ekland's in The Wicker Man. The recently released DVD is a blessing and surprisingly chockful of extras including the original short film for a movie that is apparently so reviled. The worst thing I can say about Curdled is that Braddock didn't go on to make another film and Jones went on to do a freakin Children of the Corn sequel. Recommend to all fans of serial killer movies and dark comedies. My rating 1010".

It was really cool linking the similarities between her and Esmerelda Villa Lobos from Pulp Fictionbesides both had Tarantino having some role in them both characters exhibited an almost childish facination with death and murder. And I have to admit Billy Baldwin was really stylish as the Cold Blooded killer.  This movie is definitely unique and a treat to watch.My only complaint is that the movie as a whole is rather strange.  It doesn't decide whether to be a dark comedy or some weird violent romance. It is definitely dark and weird but never steps into a comfortable niche to decied which one it really is.  This really isn't that big of a deal really and after awhile you learn to just forget the analyzation and just enjoy the madness being thrown at you. This movie is definitely not for everyone in that the gore is played so casually as if it were a normal fixture of a room like a table or a rug.  It also has a few scenes that bc of the conversational build up during the movie about what it's like to see a crime scene for the first time and the casual way that the gore is treated it may not be suitable for everyone.  However I enjoyed it bc of it's pure creativity and of course wonderful acting by the two main leads. A give it a strong 810 stars for having the courage to be different.  That is my story and I am sticking to it.".

I thought it was intriguing this woman wants to know what it would feel like to kill a man.Imagine my surprise when I turned on this movie CURDLED starring Esmeralda herself Angela Jones. Her character Gabriela is fixated on murders. She keeps scrapbooks of newsclippings and the likes. Then she joins a crime scene cleanup crew. Only she aint too bothered that much with the actual cleaning up. Instead she savors the thought that 'this is where the killing actually happened right here.'What miffed me was that I found out that Tarantino was the Exec Producer but he didn't help out with any of the writing. IMDb only credits him with the news reports There were a few scenes he could have spruced up I'm sure especially at the cleaning crew's home base. There were a few blahh moments. I also wondered if he could've been ballsy enough to keep Angela Jones as the same character as in Pulp Fiction instead of the ditzy notallthere Gabriela. But I guess this was a Reb Braddock vehicle. I see this started out as a short of his. Billy Baldwin is also very good in this.I give this a 7 or an 8 I'm not sure which I'll choose just yet. It's really a solid 7.5 on IMDb's 110 scale.Definitely check this movie out.".

	schema:reviewBody "Quentin Tarantino aglow with the buzzborne light from the soontobereleased Pulp Fiction was sitting in a darkened theater with his producerpal Lawrence Bender enjoying a shortfilm festival. The short being screened was called Curdled and it was about a Latin woman working for a housekeeping service that specialized in cleaning up crime scenes for murderers and killers. I picture our hydrocephalic hero QT laughing so loud he annoyed everyone in the theater including the film's writerdirector Reb Braddock.But Braddock needn't have worried. Our fatheaded popculture savant got up from his seat when the short was over sought out Reb and declared full of his own ego and I can only guess Goobers Listen to me Mr. Braddock alriiiiiiiight? We're gonna take your short film and make it into a feature okaaaaaaaaay? You'll writedirect and I'll produce alriiiiiiiiiiight?And so the featurelength version of Curdled was born. I'm scarcely exaggerating this story because it is the version told by Quentin himself in the film's bonus material. Could any aspiring director refuse the offer of a then whitehot Tarantino? Could you? Unfortunately for us the feature is nothing more than the 10 min. short stretched out over an hour and a half.

	onyx:emotionText "Quentin Tarantino aglow with the buzzborne light from the soontobereleased Pulp Fiction was sitting in a darkened theater with his producerpal Lawrence Bender enjoying a shortfilm festival. The short being screened was called Curdled and it was about a Latin woman working for a housekeeping service that specialized in cleaning up crime scenes for murderers and killers. I picture our hydrocephalic hero QT laughing so loud he annoyed everyone in the theater including the film's writerdirector Reb Braddock.But Braddock needn't have worried. Our fatheaded popculture savant got up from his seat when the short was over sought out Reb and declared full of his own ego and I can only guess Goobers Listen to me Mr. Braddock alriiiiiiiight? We're gonna take your short film and make it into a feature okaaaaaaaaay? You'll writedirect and I'll produce alriiiiiiiiiiight?And so the featurelength version of Curdled was born. I'm scarcely exaggerating this story because it is the version told by Quentin himself in the film's bonus material. Could any aspiring director refuse the offer of a then whitehot Tarantino? Could you? Unfortunately for us the feature is nothing more than the 10 min. short stretched out over an hour and a half. Which strangely feels like three hours.Thrill as Nothing happens in slow motion. Watch the immediatelyattractive Angela Jones Butch's cabbie in Pulp Fiction become less and less adorable as sheer boredom numbs your senses.

They did of course and to me this is a work of art with a film score that fits about as perfect to the scenes as any I have seen. Angela Jones plays Gabriela a Columbian beauty that has moved to Miami and has an obsession with bloody crime scenes. She gets a job with a company that cleans up crime scenes and she starts following the news accounts of a serial killer played by William Baldwin. After his recent murder she gets assigned the job of cleaning up the bloody mess and doesn't know it but the killer is locked in the wine closet because he left a clue to his identity. Soon there is the grand finale which is a danse macabre between the two with an ending that knocked me out of my chair when I first saw it. This is black comedy at it's darkest and most fun and the DVD is loaded with features including an intro and outro by Tarantino. It also contains the original 30 minute short version of the movie. I absolutely love this movie and recommend it very highly.".

It's like a black comedy without the black the film tried to be violent and gory but looked little more than ridiculous or the comedy.  The film is about a woman Angela Jones who quits her job and decided to go work for a company called PFCS Post Forensic Cleaning Service when she becomes fascinated with a serial killer known as the Blue Blood Killer a psychopath who goes around Miami beheading rich women.  The company is a cleaning service that is called in to clean up the blood and guts left behind in homes in the aftermath of a murder after the Cops haul the body and evidence away.  The premise for a company like this is funny one of the only moments in the film that caused me to laugh was their T.V Commercial but the end result is not.I can see why Quentin Tarantino was attracted to a project like this.  Word on the street is that this was originally a funny short film that was shown at Sundance in the early 90's and after the success of Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction Tarantino bankrolled this full length version of the movie and released it later on video with his Rolling Thunder Pictures. Tarantino seems to be very amused and fascinated with the idea of a cleaner or cleaning service to clean up the mess of the deceased.  He surely watched Luc Besson's La Femme Nikita many times in the later stages of his video store clerk days and used the idea of Victor the cleaner for his Winston Wolf character in Pulp Fiction.  The idea of a cleaner is quite funny and worked very well in both films but here it simply does not work beyond the admitted hilarity of the T.V commercial and of the mockup sensationalist realityTV show excerpt in the middle of the film.  The rest of the movie is boring and pointless and the acting apart from Angela Jones is pretty stale.  If you want to see real black comedy that will make you laugh and cringe that's another thing this film was missing I would suggest seeking out the early works of Danny Boyle Trainspotting Shallow Grave and the Coen Brother's Fargo over a boring film like this.  4 out of 10".

He also manages to show some sensitivity we can almost see into the pit of his dark soul what motivates him to kill. It does't all work however there are parts that are so illogical.

These things do not make a great movie however and this is more than evident all the way through 'Curdled'. The film suffers from an all too obvious lack of ideas and it tries to mask this with murders that are meant to be stylish and events that are supposed to be disturbing. The Mexican music score that accompanies many of the sequences in the film is obviously meant to be cool but it's becomes annoying very quickly especially as aside from the fact that the lead character is Mexican it doesn't fit with the tone of the movie. The film's plot is typically offbeat and it follows a gorehound who because of her obsession with grisly murders takes a job with a firm that cleans up murder scenes. It sounds boring and it is.William Baldwin is the only 'name' on the cast list and even he doesn't make an impression. He hasn't been given anything to do in the movie and aside from talking to his victims and standing around trying to look menacing he's pretty much wasted. Angela Jones or rather the taxi driver from Pulp Fiction takes the lead role as the murder obsessed young woman and it is always clear that it's her involvement with Pulp Fiction that won her this role not her acting ability. She may have been good enough in her small role in Tarantino's masterpiece but she doesn't have the talent to lead a film by herself. She looks lost and out of place for the majority of the film and if it weren't for her Latino accent she wouldn't convince the audience that she's a weirdo on any level. Curdled is a one hundred percentproof piece of forgettable trash. Films like this often win themselves praise for invention or black comedic antics but this one fails on all levels.

	schema:reviewBody "Aside from her nearcameo appearances in two ensemble comedies Barbra Streisand has not starred in a movie in sixteen long years not since 1996's The Mirror Has Two Faces which she also directed. Her output as an actress has been meager since around 1980 when she started directing films building houses and returning to the concert stage periodically so it was with both great anticipation and some trepidation that I saw this light hearted 2012 comedy. What a relief to find she hasn't missed a beat in her sharp comedy timing. I think she's terrific as Joyce Brewster the energetically overbearing mother of Andy an organic chemical engineer who long ago moved to California and has recently invented a cleaning solution he is pitching to various store chains headquartered across the country. He plans a weekend visit with Joyce in New Jersey but upon an intriguing discovery about her past he invites her on an eightday crosscountry road trip with him.As directed by Anne Fletcher The Proposal and written by Dan Fogelman the underrated Crazy Stupid Love who based his script on his own late mother the film is about how their two mismatched personalities unsurprisingly clash at every stop as their relationship twists and turns with each new humiliation for Andy and each new revelation for the both of them a few of them quite poignant. The film is at its comedic best when she and costar Seth Rogen as Andy volley back and forth with her wellmeaning thoughts and antics at odds with his spiky annoyance at anything she says or does. Rogen plays against type as the coiledup Andy since his stonerdude personality has been the basis of much of his previous comedy. Here he needs to show some dramatic gravity as he did earlier this year in Take This Waltz and again does surprisingly well when necessary. There is a confrontation scene between the two characters that I wish could have gone on a bit longer and deeper than it did but he manages to bring a real edge to the film in ways I didn't quite expect from him.Of course there are predictable comedy pieces that also work like a steakeating contest in Texas where Joyce has to down a fiftyounce piece of beef in an hour to avoid a 100 tab. There's also quite a supporting cast here but like Streisand movies of yore the familiar actors contribute moments that amount to nearly bit parts. Kathy Najimy and Miriam Margolyes are among Joyce's Weight Watchers friends in a quick dinner scene early in the story while Adam Scott and Ari Graynor show up at the very end of the road trip in San Francisco. In between are appearances by Brett Cullen as a cowboy who becomes smitten with Joyce during the eating contest and Nora Dunn as an officious HSN TV hostess. But that's fine since Rogen really lets Streisand dominate the movie all the way from pushing off potential suitors at a mature singles mixer to getting into the wrong car at a minimart pitstop to getting drunk in a motel bar to sharing her innocently ignorant perceptions of stereotypes. This is only her 19th film since her extraordinary debut in Funny Girl 44 years ago reason enough to enjoy the warm accomplished performance she gives here.".

In this fun tale you see Andy Brewster Seth Rogen is on a mission to sell his discovered organic cleaning product and find a distributor. In a caring move he invites his mother Joyce Brewster Barbra Streisand to come along for the eight day cross country trip. Most movies feature two guys or girls in a crazy road trip but never a mother and son. Freud was right we all have mother issues and Andy finally deals with his overbearing mother as he sets out to discover his own identity. This movie is fun touching and is above the bond between mother and son. In the preview I saw I took my own mother and she enjoyed it. In a special live simulcast with Barbra Streisand and Seth Rogen they took questions about the Road Trip. According to Streisand she was pursued by director Ann Fletcher for the role. It was not until she read the script out loud with her own son that she fell in love with the role. Streisand did a phenomenal job and you get the feeling that the role is way below her pay grade. They did accommodate all her request. All the scenes were shot within forty five minutes of her house in Malibu California and she did not even have to drive. According to the pop diva she has not driven for over a decade. She was also asked if she would ever like to take a road trip with someone and she said Marlon Brando. She did take a day trip with him once to check out the desert wild flowers once and had fun. When asked if Babs had any resemblance with his real life mother Rogen said that they are both strong Jewish women but that his mother resembled more a past character that Streisand played in Meet the Fockers. His mother is a Jewish hippie type of woman. The Guilt Trip opens December 19 perfect for the holiday season and a fun tale of love joy and celebrating life. In the end it will make you appreciate your mother and the characters discovered that they were more alike than different.".

It starts off a little clich and there's not many really hilarious moments but from the minute mark of when we get to the main story and the road trip sets off the film is out to capture your heart. Streisand comes across as a caring mom without being too overbearing or annoying and it really hits home with a lot of male audience members who are mama's boys.Rogen feels out of place at times but ultimately comes into his own and makes the character. There are some memorable scenes and overall it just sets out to be what it is and nothing more. Emotional in the end I was almost in tears and that's what a film is supposed to do capture your attention and entertain to the very soul.

They separated with an improved motherson bond. Delightful.Not a slapstick comedy.

When she directed herself camera angles always seemed to be engineered to show only one side of her face and she really didn't seem to be able to concentrate fully enough to be able to do any serious acting as an example her crying scene in The Way We Were always embarrassed me it seemed so forced and artificial.The Guilt Trip is a small enjoyable comedy that wasn't meant to be sidesplittingly funny. The refreshing thing though is that Sreisand carries the film and she's relaxed confident totally unselfconscious and a very good actress. There's a quick shot at the end of the film where she looks as though she's about to become tearful and it seemed totally authentic and I actually found myself choking up for a second. Somehow the last few years seem to have made her into a very different person and her the character she created came across to me as a very likable individual. Sure parts of the script reminded me of a t.v. sitcom but they weren't excruciatingly bad I'd like to have seen more of an explanation as to why the mother became so disappointed upon learning why her son had arranged the final trip to San Francisco it didn't make total sense to me. I'm disappointed this film didn't last longer than it did when it was released it deserved a better run.".

If the whole movie had been as entertaining as those outtakes I would have given it a 10. Unfortunately the makers of Guilt Trip appear to believe that a movie requires a plot and sadly this one was clunky. For a comedy film to work you either have to completely put reality aside Blazing Saddles or Rocky Horror Picture Show or somehow believe an unbelievable story Airplane or the Blues Brothers. This film didn't fall into either category. The plot just wasn't strong enough to support the premise that any son would be crazy enough to take his mother on a long business trip with him and there was no reason why he kept bringing her to all his business appointments. And his mother's nutty revealing of her deepest family secret and her insane babynaming system were clearly tossed in just to provide somewhere for this film to go.Don't get me wrong. I'd really like Streisand and Rogen to do another road trip together. But next time let's just say that space aliens abducted them and forced them to travel together.

	schema:reviewBody "I looked forward to this film thinking it would be a hilarious showcase of not only Streisand's talents but an expose of the difficult relationships between mothers and grown sons. I got neither. It was boring just a few minutes into it. I felt Mr. Rogen's acting was plausible and done well. However hers was lackluster and not up to her usual standards. There were very few laughs at all. The difficulties of the relationship were not highlighted very much either. Some of the dialog was nonsensical to say the least. I also thought it ridiculous to have her considering 50 yearolds for dating and trying to convince us she was under 60 usually it's the other way around. All in all I was very disappointed in this movie and had to concur with another woman leaving the theater at the same time when she said what a waste of time!".

	schema:headline " A Comedy Without Humour";
	schema:reviewBody "When the previews before the main feature show about as much promise as a toddler would in a university seminar your hopes for what you paid for on your trip to the cinema certainly diminish. The Guilt Trip is a highconcept film that revolves around a mother named Joyce Barbra Streisand and her son Andy Seth Rogen as they embark on a you guessed it! road trip across the US for Andy's career and throw some romance in there too for no apparent reason.It's never a good sign if you leave a supposed 'comedy' film being able to count the number of times you laughed with just one hand I tallied three. The first hour or so of The Guilt Trip just continues to play off of the same non developing character traits and one archetypal joke. Joyce is the stereotypical overlyattached mother whose incessant nagging and unwanted presence in her son's life is a fact oblivious to her. The film continues to regurgitate this one aspect of their relationship and in no way deals with it with any style or substance.It's as if screenwriter Dan Fogelman conjured up a single sentence for the bond between the two protagonists then when he could write no more just decided to rearrange the words of this sentence hoping nobody would ever notice. The writer's intentions were clearly to be annoying but funny but instead it is annoyingly unfunny just the way that this mother and son interact. It honestly felt as if my brain cells were being violated by hearing the same joke over and over again.To be more optimistic The Guilt Trip certainly leaves its worst qualities in the first half of the film. Midway through their trip they refuel and begin to gain some momentum that makes the 95 minute journey considerably more tolerable and my desire to punch the unlikable characters did in fact decline. The humour begins to become less one dimensional but still can only manage to extract a minute amount of audience laughter. Nonetheless this is most definitely what the picture needed following its motionless first half the successor provides more instances of cheap amusement that keep you engaged enough to appreciate the minor modest revitalisation in cinematic quality. One way to have fun throughout The Guilt Trip is to try and guess the punch line of every joke during the time that the set up is being told. This is probably the only feeling of accomplishment one could obtain from their time experiencing the film. The Guilt Trip is not a dreadful film by any means but nor is it a good one. This is easily the least entertaining and most forgettable Seth Rogen film that his catalogue of comedies has to offer. It's predictable it's a comedy without humour and the only thing that could make some of jokes more awkward not in a good sense would be if Barbra Streisand's character was sitting beside you behaving in her annoying role. The only reason I would have for recommending you devote your time and money to this 'comedy' would be if you desire to occupy some time and nothing else appeals to you. Even then I would suggest waiting until a Wednesday to use your Orange code and throw in your student card for extra discount as full admission price would almost unquestionably make you feel a sense of guilt for making the trip after you leave the cinema screen.".

So far this year we have been subjected to her 2012 Farewell Tour which I understand had tickets STARTING at 100 in the SF area. The newspaper reviews made it sound like you got about 3 or 4 songs from Barbra and the rest was from the admittedly good warmup group Il Volo. Now along comes this poor excuse for a comedy which our local theater on opening weekend had the good sense to relegate to the smallest screen in the building and that was half full.The two best parts of this movie were its brevity 90 minutes or so long and some of the outtakes at the end were worth a chuckle.".

Bogdonavich especially knew what he was doing. Even in musicals Barbra was criticized for being too sane as Dolly Levi. Didn't bother me but she always bases her characters in reality. Todays critics and audiences seem to want their comedies and characters over the top.2 Several critics have complained about seeing the diva brought down to earth. Barbra did that before in the commercially unsuccessful Up the Sandbox. That film has aged well and I suspect this one will too. 3 Whose brilliant idea was it to have Barbra talk freely after a screening of the movie for critics where she could carry on like she was Liz Taylor forcing them to move Vegas to Paris for The Only Game In Town? Yes in this respect Barbra is a diva and she should have been protected by the studio in more carefully scripted publicity events because I believe that some of these comments have caused a backlash.4 Greed. Someone thought this would clean up at Christmas. But it is the wrong time for this film. It cried out for a Mother's Day opening.5 The elephant in the room is the Jewish leads. There is tremendous antisemitism in this country now. Neil Simon flopped on Broadway several seasons ago. That audience is just not what it used to be. The many antisemitic posts on the internet about this film have sounded more 1942 than 2012. Scary.The Guilt Trip is a sweet story with humorous and touching moments. Barbra gives a lovely performance. I hope it finds its true audience.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sweet movie with a few well handled sour moments that shows you the gradual reconnecting of a somewhat strained motherson relationship. Its not that the two don't like each other just that they're way too easily annoyed by one another yes especially rogen by streissand with her constant phone messages consisting of nothing but questions but also the other way around too in a couple of quick scenes where Streissand is seemingly all too aware of how annoying her son finds her which leads to her surprised reaction at being asked by him to go on this road trip. The film does a very good job of showing you and not just telling you the two characters starting to not just like each other but appreciate each other as actual people throughout the course of the film even if it is a little slanted on the side of the mother but of course it would beits barbra steissand after all I especially liked the recurring scenes of the two of them listening to a book on cd of Middlesex throughout the filmall 22 discs of it! Its a cute device that could double as a nice representative of the film as a wholea little hokey at first the jokes made are a little shopworn at first as well Rogen is rather uncomfortable with the subject matter of the book which is understandable given that its so not the kind of book you'd wanna experience with your mom at your side but the recurring scenes throughout the movie as both characters keep coming back to that book on cd rogen gradually giving in to the narrative as well despite its over length are effective. The film itself started to have that kind of effect on me as well in that the film is a little on the hokey shopworn side but you kind of connect to them as people as the film goes on and hope they manage to work out whatever differences they have. The film is actually full of recurring things like that that start out kind of corny but become effective thru repetition. Like Streissand's character loves m and m'sshe's seen waking up or going to bed and covered in wrappers in a scene at the beg and then again in the middle and then towards the end when Rogen spots a big m and m figure his pointing out of it to his mom was a cute moment that was well built up to. Details like that are really nice touches that to me go a long way to keeping the film's characters likable and human and not just stick figures in a movie. The movie could probably be best described as cute but there are some very funny one liners throughout as well as some scenes that do a good job wringing drama out of the situation as well without being too heavy handed about it.Its been mentioned here as well but this is also a fundamentally nice film toothere aren't many scenes here that would make you squirm if you were sitting next to your mom watching itand i think to their credit the writer and director did a good job making a motherson film that successfully exploits the gap between the two without piling on what could have been really obvious and labored jokesthere's a very nice sense of low key chemistry between the two stars that even when the two of them are confronting one another on their shortcomings never quite crosses into uncomfortable hostility despite the fact that it could have very easily done so. Also despite some predictable stretches and some scenes that don't really add anything except minutes to the running time there is a nice lived in and somewhat laid back vibe to the film as a whole. for example the quick breakdown of the car in the middle of the highway and them having to wait for the tow truck to arrive while at a strip club scene while nicely low key might not really add anything plot wise but it is fairly plausible that's that how the 2 characters would react in that situation and thankfully at no point does the film threaten to descend into shrill unpleasant characterizations and unlikely comedic things happening which a lesser film like the meet the focker sequels that streissand herself appeared in would've indulged in. I think for me the best parts and prob the meat of the film were the ones that involved streissand in rogen's attempts to sell his cleaning productthroughout the film he's bombing at his various sales presentations where he's supposed to be enticing the store buyers including Costco and KMart into wanting to know more about his new productand its only at the end when he finally gets over himself long enough to actually listen to what his mom had been telling him earlier in the film that he starts to actually change his sales tacticsand again i think this was just a very nice and effective way to show the character growth without hitting you over the head with the fact that the son managed to learn a couple things from his mom after all despite the very annoying tendencies of his mom to couch the actual valid arguments in rather nagging tones that would of course lead him to discard anything she might actually have to say. Its a sweet little film and thankfully it doesn't hit you over the head with its own sweetness or hostility or mawkish sentiment going down smoothly and pleasantly enough. well maybe the big grand speech at the end overdoes it with the sentimentbut again its barbara streissand in the central roleif she can't get a nice somewhat big moment to play then what's the point in having her right?".

You will want to get out as soon as you can and you will feel guilt for wasting 95 minutes.Not that more of that clichd Jewish guilt wouldn't have been welcomed after the first act's slow setup Andy asking mom to join him on a trip out West. Not even those stops along the way would relieve your boredom given the pedestrian set pieces in a strip bar a steak house and a casino among other seemingly random choices except that inventor Andrew visits those cities to hawk his edible cleaning product.You can amuse yourself by counting the number of product placements They know me at The Gap! some from K Mart Costco Budget Rental Cars and other businesses. For those companies their products come off very well from Andrew's tepid pitch. Only when he finds his selling voice does the film come alive and Rogen awakens from a sleepy first hour for him.Making comedies is a Las Vegas gamble Witness the uneven but far more amusing This is 40 a Judd Apatow production that at least tries to be witty about social issues for aging youngsters. The Guilt Trip tries one bitthe overbearing Jewish mother and wimpy sonand doesn't get it right Whatever happened to that Oriental girl?. Now I'm feeling guilty.".

Only when he finds his selling voice does the film come alive and Rogen awakens from a sleepy first hour for him.Making comedies is a Las Vegas gamble Witness the uneven but far more amusing This is 40 a Judd Apatow production that at least tries to be witty about social issues for aging youngsters. The Guilt Trip tries one bitthe overbearing Jewish mother and wimpy sonand doesn't get it right Whatever happened to that Oriental girl?. Now I'm feeling guilty.";

	schema:reviewBody "When I first saw previews for The Guilt Trip I actually got pretty excited for it. I usually enjoy road trip movies when they're done well and I thought the concept of an overbearing Jewish Mother embarrassing her son throughout had the potential to be very humorous and relatable especially with Rogen and Streisand in the very appropriate roles. I found the preview to be very funny too. Unfortunately they pretty much used up most of the funny moments in the preview it's not actually that spoton witty for the whole hour and a half.The main problem with the movie despite it's potential is it's very flat and underwhelming. The dynamic of Rogen being annoyed by his nagging mother Streisand is established in the very beginning and is just repeated and repeated for an hour and a half with little to no progression for nearly the whole film. The road trip scenes are all under 10 minutes long with Rogen and Streisand moving from place to place with no extended interaction with characters or people in these brief settings and as a result nothing really spectacularly funny interesting or memorable happens. Like for example in a roughly 35 minute scene where Rogen's car breaks down and they go to a strip club despite the potential there is hardly anything that happens. There is a somewhat humorous awkward discussion of Rogen's Penis in public for a short bit and then a couple minutes later a stripper fixes their car and they are off. They could have done so much more with that situation! True the movie is definitely not an outrageous gross out comedy which is fine I actually respected it for that but it almost feels TOO low key like more situations should be arising for what the concept calls for. Even Rogen despite playing the character of Andy well lacks his typical adlibpop culturestoner insight banter that you would see in any Apatow endeavor. I was looking for some more Rogen rants towards his mother but his role was surprisingly restrained and serious. Sometimes the dynamic does kind of work into funny moments such as many of Rogen's lines and reactions to Barbara some of their smaller interactions reminded how I act with my own parents and were relatable. There is also a sweet sincerity to the movie despite the flatness of the actual plot you do feel some care for the characters. There is a scene where Rogen walks in on Streisand fallen asleep to baby videos where she tells him how much she loves him and he means to her. It is actually really touching you almost feel sorry for Streisand. Despite her nagging attitude you can see she is a very caring and loving mother who means well.With sincere performances and such potential you really get the feel at the end of the movie they should have pushed it further. It's a movie that definitely has heart some humor and potential but really ends up unsatisfying. It's a bit of a shame. Not a terrible movie to watch with your mother on netflix but definitely not worth the money or theater trip in my opinion.".

	schema:reviewBody "If all the kids in the world were lined up and I was to pick one kid for myself Andy it will always be you.The Guilt Trip had several things going for it considering it was directed by Anne Fletcher who in my opinion has made some decent films like The Proposal 27 Dresses and Step Up. They may not have received a lot of love from the critics but I appreciated those films and especially liked The Proposal. The script was written by Dan Fogelman who in 2011 wrote Crazy Stupid Love a movie which was in my top 20 films of the year list. And to top it all off the film was teaming up the always hilarious Seth Rogen with the beloved Barba Streisand. Despite being really famous Streisand hasn't made many films recently so fans were really looking forward to this film. I was very disappointed with The Guilt Trip because it was pretty predictable and plain. This road trip movie between a mother and a son won't appeal to a broad audience especially considering that Rogen plays a much more serious and restrained role than he usually does. I can only imagine an older target audience enjoying this film and Streisand fans will be pleased. She gives a strong performance and Rogen does a decent job as well but in my opinion the script was just too weak and it really hurt the movie. This is one of those movies that everyone will forget about by the end of the month.Andy Brewster Seth Rogen has just invented a safe cleaning product but is having a lot of issues trying to pitch it to important sales companies. He may have invented an innovative product but he really doesn't know how to market it. His mother Joyce Barbra Streisand constantly calls him and tries to keep up with him although he gets a little annoyed by her involvement in his life. When he discovers that his widowed mother had a past lover he decides it would be a good idea to hook her up with him in order to get her less involved in his own life. He doesn't tell her this of course but brings up the idea that they should take an 8 day road trip together across the United States while he meets up with different companies to sell his product. Along the way they experience new things and meet some interesting people.The Guilt Trip isn't a laugh out loud comedy instead it tried to be a more serious and dramatic film building on a mother and son relationship. It has its touching moments but for the most part the film is very predictable and seems to be heading nowhere. A more mature audience might enjoy this film but it is being pitched as a comedy which it really isn't. Don't get me wrong the film has several funny moments but it isn't your typical buddy comedy. Streisand and Rogen give strong performances but it's not enough to save the film. I prefer Rogen when he plays his usual wacky character but here he still manages to deliver a credible performance and has great chemistry with Streisand. At the end the film is about these two people trying to connect with each other and build on their relationship. As usual a road trip seems to be the best way for these two people to get over their differences and fix their problems. This could have been a much better film if the script was better but I was disappointed. Don't go see this film unless you are a Barbra Streisand fanhttpestebueno10.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of those films where I really don't have a lot to say. Basically the film is about a mother and son on a road trip to try and sell a newly invented product. There were no surprises to be had in this film and it turned out to be pretty corny although I do think that there is a demographic that will enjoy it. Barbara Streisand Joyce Brewster is the overbearing mother who totally dotes on her son. If I had a mother like her she would absolutely drive me crazy. There were times during the film that I just kept thinking to myself I wish she would just shut up. I am not sure if this was a tough script for Barbara to learn but I do know that there was a lot of it. There is one scene in the film that involves Barbara that is just so absurd and really unbelievable that it had me shaking my head. Seth Rogan Andrew Brewster was the typical son that is generally embarrassed by his mother's behavior. He did have some funny moments but not enough to make me laugh out loud although there were other folks in the audience that did. Most of the parts that did get a chuckle were in the trailer so there was really nothing new to laugh at. I just felt like I was watching reality television about a Jewish mother and son on vacation. I do have to say that I think Barbara and Seth both nailed their characters pretty well I just don't think that they had a whole lot of depth to them. There really aren't any other roles to talk about since the other actors were only on screen for a few minutes. The only other actor that I really recognized was Kathy Najimy Gayle who was one of Barbara's friends in the film. I have to say that I do support female directors whenever possible but I think that choreographer turned director Anne Fletcher is probably better at putting together dance numbers then directing. I don't want to be too hard on her since this film is her directing debut so hopefully she will get better at it. I didn't hate the film and like I said before there is definitely a demographic for it. All that being said I am giving this film an amber light.".

Our copilot on the road trip is Barbra Streisand playing Andy's widowed mum Joyce a stereotypical Jewish mom. This she does well it would have been easy to be completely OTT and annoying in the role but to Streisand's credit she keeps a lid on it. The movie begins when Joyce tells Andy the story of how he is named after her first love who ultimately rejected her to which she settles for second best with Andy's father. Andy traces his namesake down via Google to a company in San Francisco and decides to invite mum on his business trip so as to reunite them without telling her.With the setup established I settled in waiting for the hilarity involving drunkenness sex drugs fights etc. to ensue. This is after all a Seth Rogen flick. Instead we are treated to a quieter more gentle and thoughtful comedy drama were the sauciest scene involves Streisand tackling a four pound lump of meat  a steak that is. The interplay between the two leads feels very natural and you believe in their relationship. The script kept me involved throughout but there were too few laughs for me. I could envisage this produced by BBC 1 as a Sunday evening one off starring Julie Walters and Rob Brydon I'll never be a casting director.

	schema:reviewBody "Spy School is a really good movie. Although it doesn't share the science fiction special effects of Spy Kids it has a similar appeal. The camera work and the lighting are excellent. The plot is not predictable there is actually a mystery going on here that kids and adults will enjoy. The kid actors are wonderful. There's even some cool music including two renditions of Macho Man. Of course what would a teenage spy caper be without some crawling through the ducts but that's forgivable. This is a great movie to share with your children. Nothing less than innocent here don't worry. The most violence is a gun than never shoots and a guy falling a few feet off a ladder. Otherwise this is perfect entertainment for the entire family.".

	schema:reviewBody "Boy oh boy does Spy School suck. Watching it was the most unpleasant moviegoing experience I've had in a long time. It seems to be attempting to ride on the success of Spy Kids and other kid agent movies Catch That Kid etc. but having been made in 2008 it arrived too late on the scene as the public had already tired of that type of film. Even if it had been released in the right year it still wouldn't have stood up to the aforementioned Spy Kids because despite it's title Spy School the main character in the film is not a spy nor does he attend a school for spies. In fact there are no cool or interesting spy gadgets or software in the entire movie. There are a few horribly choreographed action scenes and that's about it in terms of excitement. In the beginning of the film we are introduced to Thomas the main character who is a complete jerk with no charisma whatsoever. He uncovers a plot to kidnap the President's daughter and so on. There are some pointless and tiresome love triangles subplots and moral pontificating that divert attention away from the story and I'm using the word story here very loosely. Perhaps you think I'm battering this film too hard. It's just kids movie after all right? Well I don't see how any kids would be entertained by this film. It has a convoluted plot that would be hard for a young child to follow and barely any exciting sequences throughout. It's not engaging on an emotional level plus the romance parts would probably be too mushy for children. There are so many better films for children out there. A big problem in the movie is the casting. The redhaired boy who plays Thomas is so unlikable that I grew to hate him by the end of the film. The President's daughter is played by this pudgy little girl who looks like the Honey Boo Boo child. The adults are all stereotypes and forgettable. The one bright spot in this movie is AnnaSophia Robb. They should have given her the leading role. Perhaps then this film would be more watchable.Anyway the plot builds to a climax that is so dumb when you think about it that it's almost funny. Almost. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone but a diehard AnnaSophia Robb fan and even then it'll take some willpower to get through this piece of trash.".

The movie was kinda good I guess for a kid's movie i'm giving it 910 stars because Rider Strong was in it it probably deserves more of a 710. I like that the Winn Dixie chick acknowledged the fact that Rider is cute he not only cute for a teacher he'd be hot for a rockstar! They probably only put Rider Strong in the movie because they needed somebody to play the hot teacher of course Rider is the best one for the job. The movie title doesn't really make sense it makes you think it's about kids who go to a school to be trained to be spys kinda like Spy Kids. But really it's about this kid who lies a lot and when he is finally telling the truth nobody believes him. Also the kid likes this British girl I'm pretty sure she is Cindy Loo Whoo from the Grinch but the Winn Dixie chick likes the lying kid instead even though they've been friends forever. I actually enjoyed this movie and I liked that they made Rider Strong a big character in it and that he helped the main character out with stuff and he always had his back.".

	schema:headline " Odd surreal and almost terminally slow paced this hard to find film may not be worth finding except for die hard Connelly fans.";
	schema:reviewBody "A subtle slowpaced Italian horror film where the horror is mostly implied rather than overt about a ballerina who flies to Italy to try out for an exclusive ballet school and instead becomes lost in a surreal world where time stands still for a hundred year old ballet company it's long closed theater and it's diabolical director.WARNING DESCRIPTIONS CONTAINS NUMEROUS SPOILERSJason Gary McCleery who is working for his cantankerous uncle Joshua Charles Durning sees the hauntingly beautiful Claire Jennifer Connelly as she climbs the stairs to her hotel room and drops a single ballet slipper behind her. In a Cinderella moment Jason hands her the slipper introduces himself and from that moment on he becomes obsessed with her to an almost unhealthy degree. Jason is so distracted by her that he abandons his uncle in the middle of an important auction of antique clocks when he sees Claire sightseeing in the auction hall the clock theme is obviously a reference to the idea that time has stood still or has become at the very least fluid here in this town an idea further underscored by a scene where Jason wakes up late for work because the array of antique clocks in his hotel room all have the wrong time. In a scene which almost looks as if it was plucked or borrowed from the film Flashdance Claire arrives for her ballet audition looks at all the other girls nervously peeks through the audition room door and sees how difficult its going to be then becomes even more nervous when she hears the rejected ballerina's tearful account of how poorly she was treated. Claire freezes when they call her name and does not respond. She then gathers her things and leaves quickly. Unfortunately in her panic and haste she becomes lost in the theater and ends up standing in the gloom of the main stage where she puts on an impromptu performance done by a double not Connelly which is witnessed by the tormented and haggard looking Marius Balkan Laurent Terzieff. He says the name Natalie and Claire freezes. When he drops his cane she runs away. And so is set in motion a new and strange turn of events where Claire becomes haunted by a past that is not her own or is it?. When wandering the city with Jason she finds an old mansion that seems familiar. She knows exactly where the spare key is hidden and enters the house where she discovers numerous effigies of swans and paintings all of which reference Swan Lake the ballet which she has told Jason is her absolute favorite. The next time Jason sees her in the park by the mansion she is sitting alone in an old fashioned dress watching the swans swim on the pond. She no longer responds to the name Claire. And in a moment of unintentional humor the otherwise brilliant composer Jurgen Knieper makes the most unfortunate choice to use a tremolo string motif that sounds exactly like the Twighlight Zone theme just as Claire reveals that her name is not Claire but Natalie.From this point on the story focuses on Jason's struggle to bring Claire back to reality and his eventual discovery that she's not as he first thinks confused or insane but rather there are powerful and dark supernatural forces in play. He discovers Natalie was a dancer who died long ago after she fled a performance of Swan Lake and the ballet's director Marius has been alive for at least a hundred years. Jason must now try to save Claire from the sinister ballet.There are many scenes in this film that could have been cut to make the movie flow better and there are many edits within scenes which could have been made to make the flow tighter. And there is one bizarre and surreal moment during the climax of the film which I will not reveal which will either leave the viewer in riotous laughter from the unintentional humor of the situation or will leave the viewer confused and ripped out of any sense of any kind of reality or subtle surreality that the film had maintained to that point.Overall the film is pretty much a failure. It's too slow too vague and too unfocused in its mission. Other Italian horror directors suffer this same problem i.e. Argento and Bava but those directors make up for the lack of focus and clear direction by drenching their films in artistic style. Etoile lacks this style and so everything rests on the shoulders of the story and the actors. Unfortunately the story is flawed and the actors are all sorely lacking in strong direction from the director. Gary McCleery as Jason is too over the top in his obsession with Claire and comes off a little bit stalkerish at moments. Connelly is trying to play her character as dreamy and almost childlike but with no apparent solid direction from Del Monte she ends up looking lost in her part. Horror fans and fans of Italian horror will probably be more likely to at least partially enjoy the experience of viewing this film but the casual film viewer will most likely be bored to tears. Fans of Jennifer Connelly might enjoy it purely because she looks so ethereally beautiful throughout the film her features caught here inbetween her earlier lolita looks and her later refined beauty. And good luck finding a copy. Thus far it has only been released in Japan on VHS.".

	onyx:emotionText "A subtle slowpaced Italian horror film where the horror is mostly implied rather than overt about a ballerina who flies to Italy to try out for an exclusive ballet school and instead becomes lost in a surreal world where time stands still for a hundred year old ballet company it's long closed theater and it's diabolical director.WARNING DESCRIPTIONS CONTAINS NUMEROUS SPOILERSJason Gary McCleery who is working for his cantankerous uncle Joshua Charles Durning sees the hauntingly beautiful Claire Jennifer Connelly as she climbs the stairs to her hotel room and drops a single ballet slipper behind her. In a Cinderella moment Jason hands her the slipper introduces himself and from that moment on he becomes obsessed with her to an almost unhealthy degree. Jason is so distracted by her that he abandons his uncle in the middle of an important auction of antique clocks when he sees Claire sightseeing in the auction hall the clock theme is obviously a reference to the idea that time has stood still or has become at the very least fluid here in this town an idea further underscored by a scene where Jason wakes up late for work because the array of antique clocks in his hotel room all have the wrong time. In a scene which almost looks as if it was plucked or borrowed from the film Flashdance Claire arrives for her ballet audition looks at all the other girls nervously peeks through the audition room door and sees how difficult its going to be then becomes even more nervous when she hears the rejected ballerina's tearful account of how poorly she was treated. Claire freezes when they call her name and does not respond. She then gathers her things and leaves quickly. Unfortunately in her panic and haste she becomes lost in the theater and ends up standing in the gloom of the main stage where she puts on an impromptu performance done by a double not Connelly which is witnessed by the tormented and haggard looking Marius Balkan Laurent Terzieff. He says the name Natalie and Claire freezes. When he drops his cane she runs away. And so is set in motion a new and strange turn of events where Claire becomes haunted by a past that is not her own or is it?. When wandering the city with Jason she finds an old mansion that seems familiar. She knows exactly where the spare key is hidden and enters the house where she discovers numerous effigies of swans and paintings all of which reference Swan Lake the ballet which she has told Jason is her absolute favorite. The next time Jason sees her in the park by the mansion she is sitting alone in an old fashioned dress watching the swans swim on the pond. She no longer responds to the name Claire. And in a moment of unintentional humor the otherwise brilliant composer Jurgen Knieper makes the most unfortunate choice to use a tremolo string motif that sounds exactly like the Twighlight Zone theme just as Claire reveals that her name is not Claire but Natalie.From this point on the story focuses on Jason's struggle to bring Claire back to reality and his eventual discovery that she's not as he first thinks confused or insane but rather there are powerful and dark supernatural forces in play.

To start with in order to enjoy this film I recommend that you watch a performance of Swan Lake beforehand. Jennifer Connelly's characters OdetteOdile will be told and danced with better understanding. She plays two different women Claire Hamilton and Natalie Horvath. In my opinion Claire is Odette innocent and graceful and Natalie Horvath is Odile seductive and sadistic.When Jason Gary McCleery Claire's new boyfriend and Claire are together we hear beautiful soothing music. But when Jason and Natalie Claire are together we hear that perfect melancholy melody by Jurgen Kneiper.Claire's character suddenly changes when she takes on the persona of Natalie Horvath mentally and physically. It is always a challenge for an actress to take the role of a ballerina. She does do a bit of the dancing herself and looks beautiful while doing it. As Natalie she holds her head higher walks gracefully sits up straight is more calm and also has no memory of who she really is.I won't give the entire plot away but it's basically a story of suspense mystery ballet love supernatural powers and a race against time itself. If you are a Jennifer Connelly or a Swan Lake fan send for this. It is now on DVD.".

I wont say any more regarding the plot because it's pretty thin one more sentence about it would pretty much tell you everything that happens in it. This is not the worst film I have ever seen but it's also far from the best. Stuff happens without explanation and it's not easy to figure out for yourself why said stuff happened. Connelly looks like she would rather be somewhere else at times and so her performance lacks charisma. So considering the film rides on her performance it would probably be quite apt to say that the whole film lacks charisma. I gave it 4 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have to admit that I wouldn't have seen this film were it not for the fact that Jennifer Connelly is in it. However in spite of the fact that was the only reason I saw it there certainly is an opportunity for a good film here...but unfortunately it wasn't taken. The film takes on a very arty style and it's clear that director Peter Del Monte has a higher opinion of the film than he has any right to. The story reminded me somewhat of the Dario Argento classic Suspiria with regards to it's setting although the film is not stylish enough to carry off something nearly as good. The plot focuses on Claire a ballerina who travels to Italy in order to attend a dance school. Upon her arrival she meets the rather strange Jason who immediately falls in love with her the attraction being somewhat mutual. However soon after strange things start happening and Claire gets it into her head that she is actually called Natalie! Thus leading Jason to get to the bottom of the mystery in order to save Claire.Jennifer Connolly looks nice as always but doesn't give her best performance in this film. The material is not great and that is certainly a contributing factor however. The film really lacks direction and it's never clear where it's going to go. This can be a great asset for a film but it isn't in this case because the film never moves in any direction that is interesting and as such we end up with a meandering mess. The fact that the pace of the film is very slow does not help in the excitement stakes and I'm sure I'm not the only one who was bored well before the film's conclusion. Peter Del Monte inserts all kinds of symbols and points into the film and while some of them do hit home most of them don't. I can't say I'm much of a fan of Ballet but I do appreciate the grandeur of it. The director seems to as well but while the ending borders on being memorable the Ballet scenes generally aren't used particularly well. I really couldn't care less how the film would turn out and unsurprisingly the film ends on a confusing note. Overall since this film is very hard to find I somehow doubt it will find an audience and only the real hardcore Jennifer Connolly fans should go to the trouble.".

	schema:reviewBody "Thanks to a poor script and the woeful direction of Peter Del Monte ETOILE was a flop in 1988 never released to this day in the U.S. despite being filmed in English with American leading actors. Suddenly it takes on new interest as a direct forerunner of the current hit BLACK SWAN.Jennifer Connelly who gives a glazed performance especially compared with the allstopsout tour de force of Natalie Portman plays an American ballerina named Claire traveling to Budapest to further her career. She is possessed by the spirit of a ballerina from 1891 who danced her final performance there in Swan Lake.A chilling early scene has Claire receiving a bouquet of black flowers with a note Welcome back Natalie. This refers to the 1891 ballerina named Natalie Horvath but today gives off an eerie note with the coincidence of actress Portman's first name some 22 years later in such a similar role.Both films deal with loss of identity but ETOILE adopts a very cornball Gothic romance style which falls flat. In fact everything about the film is flat except Connelly's torso see her in CAREER OPPORTUNITIES made a couple of years later and you'll see what I mean. The romantic male lead Gary McCleery whose career went nowhere is terrible  a blank space on the screen and an endless subplot concerning his uncle played hammily by Charles Durning obsessed with buying rare clocks merely kills time.The ballet master was wellcast with Laurent Terzieff a wonderful creepy looking French actor better casting than Vincent Cassel in the new film but unfortunately Terzieff has little to do. Similarly scarily beautiful Olimpia Carlisi is wasted as an evil black queen figure.In the '80s I watched all of Del Monte's films that were in fact imported to America watching them in 35mm I can give a fair appraisal. SWEET PEA was merely cute I greatly enjoyed INVITATION AU VOYAGE which was an arthouse flop here when released by Columbia's Triumph Films subsidiary and JULIA  JULIA was a disaster a millstone on Kathleen Turner's otherwise booming career at the time. With ETOILE Del Monte comes off as just another hack.".

'Beat' Takeshi was just brilliant in the role of Aniki. It's a sign of a great actor when he can command your attention without really doing anything.I loved its thoughtful pace and purpose and how there was a real symmetry in the story. In terms of introduction of the characters and their interactions the story closes in reverse really nicely. I won't say much more as I don't want to spoil it it's not major just nicely done.All in all I highly recommend it. It's quite violent at times but if you're okay with that and hell perhaps even like it in a Kill Bill kind of way then definitely check this out.".

It's a sign of a great actor when he can command your attention without really doing anything.I loved its thoughtful pace and purpose and how there was a real symmetry in the story. In terms of introduction of the characters and their interactions the story closes in reverse really nicely. I won't say much more as I don't want to spoil it it's not major just nicely done.All in all I highly recommend it. It's quite violent at times but if you're okay with that and hell perhaps even like it in a Kill Bill kind of way then definitely check this out.";

This entertaining and surprisingly fast moving picture for a Kitano film release date was delayed in the United States by more than a year. When it was finally released the film played mainly in Art houses and was heavily edited by the old cronies that sit on the M.P.A.A. board. It's impossible to see this movie how it was original meant to be show. Sadly prior releases even on video were the same old prints that were used during it's theatrical release. Hohum.

	schema:headline " Another masterpiece from Kitano";
	schema:reviewBody "Takeshi Kitano's Brother is Kitano's masterpiece among his other films. I really haven't seen bad film from him. Brother is set in America as Kitano's character travels to US from Japan and starts new life there. He has his half brother living there so he has a place to live in. Soon he starts to have new friends and become a leader and member of their new gangyakuza. Violent confrontations with other gangs and mafia take place as everyone is willing to use violence and vengeance in order to settle things.Brother has all the usual and breath taking Kitano elements we've learnt to see. The flashbacks of events long shots without editing character's faces that say more things than 100 words images of beauty and peace and wry humor among others elements. The main theme in Brother is loyalty and friendship that becomes even love. The last scene is fantastic and very unusual for Kitano never has he underlined his message this clearly as he does in Brother's finale. It is so purifying scene and really makes the point clear but still most people don't understand anything about Kitano's films because they are so personal and different compared to Western mainstream films.Brother is like a combination of Violent Cop and Hana'Bi. It has Violent Cop's bleakness and HanaBi's beauty and sadness. Brother is very sad film at times and only last scene gives something really positive and also optimistic. HanaBi is very sad and beautiful film and these two Brother and HanaBi have much in common. Both were composed by the same guy Joe Hisaishi who did fantastic job especially in HanaBi and also Sonatine. Violent Cop is very gritty and also pessimistic film and is very similar to Brother in its overall look of life. Both films are also very calm and restrained and not as visually stunning as HanaBi and Sonatine. All these films are masterpieces of Japanese cinema and it is interesting to see how Kitano mixes elements from his other films and creates always something new and immortal. The violence is very brutal and challenging but definitely not gratuitous or exploitative. Kitano's violence is always very symbolic and sudden and not necessarily realistic. These films analyze many aspects of violence as a tool of communicating for weak souls. Kitano definitely doesn't justify violence or praise it he just shows what most people or film makers probably wouldn't even dare to think of and once the viewer may be thinking yeah kill that brd! the film turns against the viewer and makes him think what he just said and accepted. The more emotionally challenging film is the more noteworthy it becomes and Kitano's films are perfect examples of that. Brother is also occasionally filled with Kitano's wry and personal humor which was at its taunting in his Boiling Point. Brother has many great personal touches of its creator and every time Kitano's character laughs here there is something very twisted in his mind and going on. Brother is not thoroughly cynical film after all and these humoristic touches only add to the great purification of the last scene. The film criticizes yakuza also pretty much and with the director's personal style as there are numerous scenes involving yakuza rites and codes of honor. Also there is a great scene involving basketball and yakuza member's attempt to get the ball and be king of the game and have a feeling of being somebody. Boiling Point has plenty of these scenes and tones as the gangsters play tough guy with big guns and thus try to get acceptance. These films really should make yakuzas ask themselves why?I am totally stunned by cinematic styles Kitano uses in his films. The editing and photography is so incredibly smooth and stylish and creates the atmosphere of the film. The faces are among the most important details in Kitano's films as there are so many things to be read from characters' faces. For example there is awesome scene in Brother's beginning where Kitano sees the death of a yakuza boss. Kitano has totally unique sense of beauty sensitivity and expressing emotions that has no comparison from other films. His character doesn't talk too much in his films but anytime he says something he says and expresses more than thousand words. His films are immortal and can be seen over and over again and still they have plenty of things to offer for the lover of this unique cinema.Brother is among Kitano's greatest films and I definitely give this ten out of ten because there are absolutely no negative aspects in this film and this proudly stands in Takeshi Kitano's filmography.".

But when I watched itI was completely blown away. It was intelligent without being terribly confusing and it was violent without being overly gross. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen and is quite possibly one of the greatest films ever made. The story concerns Aniki Yamomoto Takeshi kitano under the name Beat Takeshi who joins a very welltodo yakuza family in japan. But when a price is put on his head he flees to America to set up shop there with his younger brother Ken kuroudo Maki under the name Claude Maki and his gang which includes a black man named Denny Omar Epps. They run into trouble with other mobs in the city but Aniki's style of war brings them on a steady inclination to the top. Underrated and underappreciated this little gem is definitely a good one to own as it is truly a cinematic masterpiece.".

The body count is higher than in all Quentin TarantinoSam Peckinpah films together and even some gore like cut off fingers and heads is brought on here and there. Once more the violent pictures are laid under with beautiful piano music what gives some disturbing aspects as well as emotional rollercoasters to this film.

Of course Brother does have Kitano's trademark scenes even if not nearly as elaborate as those in Sonatine or Fireworks a brief longshot scene at the beach and a GREAT roof scene with the paper airplane...LOOK OF COURSE FOR SOME CHOPPED FINGERS ETC.I am perhaps rambling a little. It shows you how ambivalent my feelings about Kitano in fact are. On one hand I like him a lot and consider him a rarely gifted film maker. In fact one of the finest. On the other hand I deeply deplore his basic premises death and misogyny. I can't make up my mind. I keep wanting to stay away from his films and I end up seeing them one after another.

	schema:reviewBody "I am a huge fan of the brilliant cinematic genius Takeshi Kitano his films HanaBi 1997 and Violent Cop 1991 are two of my alltime favorites and I also found several other Kitano films such as Zatoichi 2003 excellent. Brother of 2001 is in my opinion Kitano's weakest film up to date which does not mean that it's bad. It is just not quite as brilliant as Kitano's other work. Kitano is once again director and leading actor and he once again delivers a great performance in the lead. Yakuza Aniki Yamamoto Kitano flees to America after his death is ordered by a Yakuza clan. Yamamoto goes to LA where his younger brother Ken is supposed to study. Instead of studying however Ken deals drugs with some American friends. And it doesn't take Yamamoto long to plan some drastic improvements for his little brother's gang...Takeshi Kitano's performance is once again superb this guy certainly is one of the greatest cinematic multitalents who ever lived. I found the Japanese characters great in general and if it was only for them Brother would have probably almost reached Kitano's masterpieces in brilliance. I personally didn't like the American characters though. Omar Epps certainly is a good actor but his character of Denny is just not very deep simply the very stereotypical African American street gangster seen in two out of three cheesy Hollywood blockbusters. And that counts for the other American characters too. It wasn't actually that bad with Omare Epps simply because he is a very good actor. Besides the flatness of the American characters I found the movie very good. It is once again beautifully and imaginatively filmed in typical Kitano style and it has the typical Kitano humor that I love. The movie is also very violent so it's probably not for people who are easily offended by brutality in films. What I also really like about Brother is the fact that at least half of the movie is in Japanese. The Japanese characters also talk Japanese when they are in the US.Brother is arguably Kitano's weakest movie and definitely my least favorite of his movies but that doesn't mean it's bad. We're talking about a great cinematic genius here and Brother certainly is a good suspenseful entertaining stylish and interesting film. In case you don't know Kitano yet i recommend to watch Hanabi or Violent Cop before watching this but in case you're already familiar with Kitano Brother is certainly worth watching. My fellow Kitano fans should not miss this. Recommended 710".

I won't spoil anything but will say the violence is very unforgiving and will just make you stare at the screen openmouthed. The cinematography is great and it had patience scenes like you would in much western cinema including over half a minute of Kitano walking up a street after arriving in America. Everything Kitano does is a joy to watch. His facial expressions are often subtle just minor changes but you tend to get it. The movie did not glorify the Yakuza in any way and although I'm not very educated on the subject may have made them out to be worse than they are although it did stress their code of honour.

	schema:headline " Comparing this to the likes of Goodfellas and The Godfather is a disgrace pure and simple.";
	schema:reviewBody "Brother is  Kitano's first picture financed by western production companies and produced on American soil. It centers on Yakuzamember Yamamoto Kitano being exiled from his home country by rival gangs. He travels to the U.S. where he teams up with his brother formes his own Yakuzaforce and climbs the ranks of the underworld by violently disposing of his enemies. Kitano is known for using extreme violence in his pictures and Brother is no exception. On the contrary Brother features some of the most graphic scenes in recent film history. Unfortunately Kitano fails to create any sense of direction or unity in his effort. Brother consists of consecutive scenes depicting violent assasinations of rivals followed by scenes featuring retaliations by the aforementioned rivals. The is no sense of allegiance or even alignment with Yamamoto and his associates including Omar Epps in one of his worst performances yet. We never get inside the mind of Yamamoto and Kitano leaves us with a ruthless stoic unendearing zombie wearing sunglasses all day long hardly talking and thus failing to make us care about him or his actions. I have no problems with scenes of people cutting of their thumbs as long as they serve somekind of purpose in the plot. Kitano seems to have no motivation whatsoever for showing us these images beside maybe shocking us. Furthermore he includes various scenes that don't have any purpose in the movie at all. It all makes for a very confusing and uneven piece of work. Actingperformances in Brother are bland and very poorly delivered with the actors saying their lines without any sense of conviction or purpose. Kitano's poor writing only makes matters worse. Also cinematography in this picture is handled very poorly just as every other aspect of Brother. There is no direction in most of the shots beside making sure the actors appear in them. All in all it makes for a very tiresome and unsatisfying viewing. I've heard Brother being compared to the likes of Goodfellas and The Godfather and i have to say it's a disgrace as Brother doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence with these masterpieces. Not recommended to be sure.".

Violence is obviously key to the director's style but it is neither slick nor clever despite being presented in short horrific bursts. The story is poor loosely strung together and collapses at the end in a heap of selfpity. I am confused as to how anyone can find merit in this film.

	schema:reviewBody "Wow. According to IMDb the body count in this film is a whopping 78! Had I known this ahead of time I probably wouldn't have watched this film. I am usually turned off by overly violent films as too often there isn't much of a story and it's just an excuse for grossout special effects that appeal to our lowest instincts. So did the film win me over or was it just another bloodfest? Well it did impress methat's for sure.Takeshi Kitano also known as Beat Takeshi wrote directed and starred in this film. It begins in Japan and two rival yakuza clans are at war with each other. Eventually to end the conflict the surviving members of one clan officially join the otherall but one hard guy Kitano. Instead of killing him however they send him overseasto an exile of sorts.Kitano arrives in America to stay with his younger halfbrother. However the younger guy is a punk drug dealer hanging with lowlifesnot a yakuza bigwig like Kitano. One of the younger halfbrother's friends Omar Epps meets Kitanoand the meeting is very memorable! In fact EVERYTHING about his dealings with Kitano turn out to be memorable. Kitano soon decides to take out the halfbrother's enemies and starts a gang war with the Mexican gangs thanks to his crazy macho waysand Kitano seems not the least bit concerned during all this as his face is quite deadpan and cold throughout. After all in his mind if people hurt you just kill them...as well as their friends. He is truly a scary guy here! And a scary get bent on taking over everything. At least it's nice to see a man with ambition! Following Takeshi's example his small band of punks quickly grows. And so does their ambition and love of violence. Among all this is a weird suicide scene in fact there was another really weird one later. I guess it makes sense in a way...but man is it weird. And so the body count rises...very quickly. And the younger halfbrother soon sees himself as a really really bad guyand it's easy to see that he and his friends are setting themselves up to fall.After seeing this film I noticed it bore some resemblance to an earlier Kitano filmSonatine. Both have very similar themes a similar deadpan performance by Kitano and feature some oddly surreal scenes of mobsters at work and play. And both have ENORMOUS body counts. While good films and I certainly could respect how they were crafted they also were both pretty unpleasant viewing and I can't imagine watching more of these! Well made but yuck! By the way it was nice to see James Shigeta in this film. He was once a very popular actor but hasn't been as active in recent years. Also during the course of all the killing did you notice that NEVER did any police respond to any of the gunfire?! Maybe it's just too common an occurrence in LA...or the film just forgot about this.".

People hanging around bonding over a game of basketball or throwing ball in a beach. It's what Johnnie To has been doing over in Hong Kong. But To builds with an eye for elegy for tenderness about to be swept away by carnage and the carnage ennobled as ballet of violence.

Why do Bollywood directors have to copy Hollywood when they are doing a project which is different from any typical Bollywood film this movie is just another example of how Bollywood can make a good Hollywood film not only look bad but rip off totally.I cannot remember ever seeing a Bollywood remake of a Hollywood film and actually make it enjoyable rather than annoying this movie is just another one to add to the list of unoriginal Bollywood films and another directorwriter to add to the list of unoriginality. there are many bad Bollywood films out there but when it comes down to movies like this it really is embarrassing to the industry that they even got the budget to make the movie.In the industry today there are only two directors which have made Bollywood proud and these two directors are Ashutosh Gowariker and Sanjay Leela Bhansali who are not only great directors but also great writers. The director and writers really need to take notes from these two directors.Overall I wont really recommend this movie to anyone even though it may have the best special effects for a Bollywood movie.p.s. I wont be surprised if the directorwriters try making there own version of Swades after reading this comment.".

I am an unabashed admirer of Indian creativity in this context.Take the case of movies like 'Alag' or 'Benares' or 'Encounter the Killing'. What is notable about these movies is that every frame of these movies is pulsating with action the makers of these movies grip your attention from the word go and keep you enthralled for the entire duration of the movies and yet Indian movie goers as well as critics give them lukewarm reception. On the other movies like 'Fanaa' 'Kabhi Kushi Kabhi Gham' or 'Ham Aapke Hain Kyon' take such a long time to make a point that one can go for a game of tennis while watching the movie and come back and you would not missed any of the action except for a few songs. Such movies receive raves from the BoxOffice as well as accolades from critics as well  as if what matters most in the final analysis is that every movie shall be a chick flick.It just goes to prove a point that market success and genuine creativity in most cases reside on different planets.

	schema:reviewBody "I always like movies with actorsactresses who are not famous and who have to prove themselves to be worthy in a bollywood movie. I really liked Akshay Kapoor as an actor. He is like all the other male Kapoor's a born natural actor. Alag is a sort of super hero movie. It is about a bald boy who cannot stand the light and has to stay inside the house his whole life. He is very smart and has some super powers. Then his father dies and he has to face the world on his own.The story is not new but for bollywood a nice try to make a super hero movie. When you put a good new actor like Akshay in a movie with bad actors like Diya Mirza or the man who plays her father. For instance her father is the head of the school where Akshay Tejas what a stupid name! goes. Tejas does some stupid things because of his powers. The head of the school is in important man no one can meet him. But Tejas can! He tries to tell Tejas not to do such things and not always to tell the truth but first to think what to say. Tejas doesn't like this he wants to tell the truth always. Tejas is very angry. Then Diya Mirza tries to explain her father is hurt and she takes Tejas to the hospital to let him see that her mother is in coma. When a man is important not every one can just come into the room and listen what he is saying because at the point Tejas is seeing Diya's father in hurt her father cries near the bed of his wife talking about Tejas! How unrealistic like the whole world has been turning around Tejas already.At that point you already know Tejas is going to make his wife better so that was predictable. As sudden Tejas is dreaming about moments he has hair. Then you see a man dancing. I don't know if this was Akshay also but if he was it really is a different look! Akshay was not suited for this role. This because Akshay is very muscular. When Akshay takes of his shirt I don't see a boy who has been at home behind the books for 18 years but I see a man who has been in the gym every day! Then you have a really good actor in the movie like Sharat Saxena. Then he has to be a police man AGAIN! It is so boring this man can do so much more he has been a police man for ever. His role is very small unfortunately.The movie was worth seeing special effects were great. Acting of the small actors and actresses was boring and not realistic. Story was predictable. It was a little bit stolen from The green mile. If Diya Mirza had been alive at the end of the movie there could have been an Alag sequel with their son to be a masked super hero like Krrish HA HA!The special appearances at the end was a surprise but was it necessary? No it wasn't. It was an expensive way to put a lot of Bollywood character into the movie in just one song. That was not a cherry on the icecream. On the contrary Alag was about to be a movie on itself like Krrish. A good movie without the stupid actors like Sharukh and Preity Zinta. It was about to become a rocket from an airplane. But with the stupid famous actors and actresses in the last song is was a rocket who had to crash back on earth. A pity.".

	schema:reviewBody "It appears that many critics find the idea of a Woody Allen drama unpalatable. Interiors gets slammed as a forced awkward heavyhanded and cheapened imitation of Bergman most noticeably Cries and Whispers and usually discussed in context of Annie Hall that preceded it and Manhattan that followed.Well Annie Hall was funny as hell and I love Manhattan  it's directed with an authority that I don't think was matched in another Woody Allen film Crimes and Misdemeanors had touches of such visual elegance. With the exception of course of Interiors which preceded it.Interiors is Woody Allen putting aside his neuroses and directing with unshakable confidence. Granted Bergman has already cleared the path for him to some degree but Interiors stands on its own. Visually and aurally it's a quiet film permeated with silences dark offwhite colors beige and grays mostly despair and sadness. It's the existential hell and it's a lot quieter than the descriptive terms make it seem.Narratively Interiors has the fluidity and grace of any other of Allen's more successful films. Like the multicharacter Hannah and Her Sisters or the parallelism of Crimes and Misdemeanors the stories relationships and situations rise and build naturally.Interiors is essentially the story of an upperclass family shattered if not exposed and tested by the divorce of the parents and the ensuing collapse of the mother. The title of course refers not only to the profession of the mother who is arguably the central character and definitely the emotional and psychological catalyst for the events of Interiors but also works on a metaphorical level. Interiors that Allen implies are those that shatter when the mother phenomenally played by Geraldine Page is forced to face the separation from her husband. The neat world constructed by her starts to crumble revealing not only the painful truth to her but also to her daughters who are greatly affected by this as well. The truth of course is that nothing was perfect in the first place  the interiors were simply created to shelter from the reality of family crisis bottledup emotion undue expectations selfishness synthetic love and conflict.The conflicts that arise or rather expose themselves bring to light themes that are quite frankly very Allenesque. Allen explores the burdens of existence namely the inevitability of death and the question of the immortality of art loneliness the failure of relationships and thus violation of trust and the search for meaning in life. Interiors however differs from his other films in that it takes a distinctly psychological approach to these problems. It does so by not exposing its themes through situations like Woody Allen finding out that he might be dying in Hannah and her Sisters and attempting suicide but rather through realistic psychological observation of familial relations  particularly motherdaughter ones.Like many Bergman films Interiors is psychological to the core even though I don't recall a single shrink in the film. It's also dramatic and quieter than all other Allen films. Finally it would be a shame not to mention that while obviously very Bergmanesque the film is seeped in the atmosphere of many Chekhov plays bordering on the psychological darkness of Ibsen. Interiors is the American film version of early20th century European theatrical drama  the problems of the welloff upperclass families not being able to survive social emotional and psychological instability that they themselves contributed to creating. We are talking of people with intellectual and monetary resources  resources that we treat as essential to happiness. Interiors like many of the darker of Allen's comedies is a quietly terrifying questionmark  it is directed at our lives and our values. And the answers are nothing but perturbing. Little to laugh about really.".

On the surface layer it presents an inside look at a dysfunctional family that is coming to terms with themselves the divorce of their parents and finally the death of their mother.  Under this quite but strikingly sorrowful first layer is a second layer of insight of considerably more importance.  The underlayer is about the interaction of the principal characters and how they attempt to manipulate each other in generally destructive patterns that are even now becoming more and more prevalent in our socioeconomic culture. Not surprisingly after a second or third look this film should be included as part of the curriculum for medical residents working towards the specialty of Psychiatry. It is definitely a film about the destructive and continuing decaying family structure with which we are becoming more and more aware.  It is not a film about morality so important an issue in the 1990's but about the simple misunderstanding of parenting in families that leave so many in our society emotionally crippled.  The result is seen in the three daughters representing the generations of bored and depressed young and middle aged middle class people that spend great amounts of time and money trying to prove to themselves that they are happy and cope with the idea of real happiness that has eluded them. Of the films that will survive as anthropological glimpses of the 20th and possibly 21st Centuries in the United States this film will be on the short list.".

Critics at the time however to their credit gave the film a fair reading and for three brilliant excerpt of period reviews I recommend the Wikipedia entry on the movie.So watch this film thinking it's by someone else if you have to. take it in on its own subtle terms as three sisters watch their own deficiencies bloom when their parents abruptly separate. There is some familiar territory here actors Allen has turned to many times including Diane Keaton of course who he was once in 1970 involved with.

In short Interiors was and is appreciated but always with a feeling that it isn't quite complete that it isn't what it could have been. It's easy to see that it is unremittingly dour almost to perversion. And you might say that it plays the Bergman card too hard without overt appropriation which makes it merely derivative that worst of echoes. It is fair I suppose to say that Allen really has succeeded but not in the remarkable ways he had succeeded so clearly in his earlier films including his previous nugget Annie Hall which is in my view his first true drama but which has the benefit of also being funny.Or you can just sit back and take it in for what it does do so well letting the interior lives of these people seem as shattered and pathetic as they really seem. The photography by Gordon Willis is admirable for being beautiful and inventive without being distracting. Allen and Willis make clear this intention with opening shots a series of fixed camera views of rooms and then views out windows all framed with classic proportions but sequenced to pull you in. But look how often the camera follows two people as they walk and talk either up close in front of them or along the beach through an irregular snow fence. Its pace and tastefulness of the photography almost seems designed by one of the main characters the troubled interior decorator mother played with uncanny effectiveness by Geraldine Page.Expect nothing in particular here except a tourdeforce that works on its own depressing terms.".

For me Interiors is not one of Allen's best filmsAnnie Hall Crimes and Misdemeanours Manhatten Hannah and Her Sisters Husbands and Wives with some dialogue monologues that ramble on a bit too much but when it comes to his most underrated films Interiors is very high on the list. It is very easy to see why people wouldn't like it with how bleak it is and how it's different from much of what Allen has done but those are hardly reasons to dismiss Interiors because apart from the occasional rambling it is a great film. It is very stylishly shot with good use of locations probably Allen's second most visually striking 70s film after Manhattan. Like Annie Hall there's no music score and that's not a bad thing at all Interiors is a very intimate and intricate film and having no music added to that quality. Much of the dialogue is full of insight and pathos to me it did have dramatic weight and it is one of Allen's most honest films along with Husbands and Wives. The screenplay is not funny as such and is not as quotable as Annie Hall but it wasn't ever meant to be. The story is paced deliberately but how Interiors was written and performed ensures that it isn't dull it was very movingpersonally it didn't topple into melodrama and layered storytelling didn't notice any convolutions deftly handled. Allen directs assuredly in one of his more restrained directing jobs. The characters are neurotic and not the most likable but are written and performed with such compelling realism that in the end there is some sympathy felt for them. The cast was a talented one in the first place and none of them disappoint. Especially good are Geraldine Page in one of her best performances in very frightening and heartbreakingly tormented form and Mary Beth Hurt the centrepiece of the story and is very affecting. Maureen Stapleton is a breath of fresh air as the most lively character an anti thesis to the rest of the characters but not an out of place one and E.G. Marshall brings a great deal of quiet dignity. Diane Keaton when it comes to Woody Allen films is better in Annie Hall and Manhattan but plays a purposefully shrill character with gusto. Richard Jordan and Sam Waterson are fine. Kristin Griffith is good too but her part seemed underwritten. All in all won't be for everybody but a great film from personal perspective and one of Woody Allen's most underrated. 910 Bethany Cox".

Much of the dialogue is full of insight and pathos to me it did have dramatic weight and it is one of Allen's most honest films along with Husbands and Wives. The screenplay is not funny as such and is not as quotable as Annie Hall but it wasn't ever meant to be. The story is paced deliberately but how Interiors was written and performed ensures that it isn't dull it was very movingpersonally it didn't topple into melodrama and layered storytelling didn't notice any convolutions deftly handled. Allen directs assuredly in one of his more restrained directing jobs. The characters are neurotic and not the most likable but are written and performed with such compelling realism that in the end there is some sympathy felt for them. The cast was a talented one in the first place and none of them disappoint. Especially good are Geraldine Page in one of her best performances in very frightening and heartbreakingly tormented form and Mary Beth Hurt the centrepiece of the story and is very affecting. Maureen Stapleton is a breath of fresh air as the most lively character an anti thesis to the rest of the characters but not an out of place one and E.G. Marshall brings a great deal of quiet dignity. Diane Keaton when it comes to Woody Allen films is better in Annie Hall and Manhattan but plays a purposefully shrill character with gusto. Richard Jordan and Sam Waterson are fine. Kristin Griffith is good too but her part seemed underwritten. All in all won't be for everybody but a great film from personal perspective and one of Woody Allen's most underrated. 910 Bethany Cox";

What a pretentious ponderous and painfully boring piece of 70's wine and cheese tripe. Woody Allen is one of my favorite directors but Interiors is by far the worst piece of crap of his career.

The film intentionally has no comic relief no music and is drenched in shadowy pathos.

Everyone is lost and struggling desperate to find direction or understanding or whatever and it just goes on and on to the point where you just want to slap all of them. It's never about resolution it's only about interminable introspective babble. It is nothing more than a psychological drama taken to an extreme beyond the audience's ability to connect. Woody Allen chose to make characters so immersed in themselves we feel left out. And for that reason I found this movie painfully self indulgent and spiritually draining. I see what he was going for but his insistence on promoting his message through Prozac prose and distorted film techniques jettisons it past the point of relevance. I highly recommend this one if you're feeling a little too happy and need something to remind you of death. Otherwise let's just pretend this film never happened.".

	schema:headline " to me more than just a Bergman homage it's deeply felt and superbly acted tragic theater";
	schema:reviewBody "It has been an easy observation or criticism of Interiors Woody Allen's first break from acting and comedy as a filmmaker is an homage of the bleak spellbinding films of despair of Ingmar Bergman's films. It's not without a point that critics note this homages of Bergman have shown in many of his films Love  Death Husbands  Wives Deconstructing Harry etc. But one must not neglect that if Woody connects to Bergman Bergman connects with the masters of naturalistic drama like Ibsen and Strindberg and that as a writer Woody has been influenced by dozens and dozens of authors of literature and theater. With Interiors his script and direction is is observant and is able to get under the skin of a viewer by giving the characters under the upperclass veneer attributes that aren't too oblique or cold. It is definitely not one of the Woody films I would recommend to someone first getting into his films the comedies are best for that but it is a great start to the sort of section of films that Woody does there are two I consider his entertaining sophisticated comedies which he often is the star of being one and the other being his dramas.One thing is hard to dispute the cast that is assembled is all pro who physically look the parts and emotionally sink into them as real people not caricatures. Flyn Joey and Renata are daughters of a wealthy wouldbe lawyer EG Marshall and her perfectionist needy and mentally troubled homemaker Eve Geraldine Page perhaps her best. After their separation Eve tries to make it on her own still controlling still clinging to the children who will stay around her which is Joey but has a breakdown and attempted suicide. Soon after this Marshall's character finds love elsewhere played by Maureen Stapleton also a very good performance a fascinating outsider in the midst of the family's reaching for real love and happiness. This brings even more turmoil on the sisters who each deal with their own emotionalpsychological problems with themselves and their significant others.It's hard to point out who's performances are the 'best' in the film as each contribute something different and intense. Keaton is particularly interesting as a writer with a drunken writer husband who can't seem to come to grips with herself amid the looming presence of her mother. Hurt's character is similar in this vein but dealing with something a little more existential I think. Most of the characters curiously not Eva who for this reason is a little more affecting and arresting in her quiet disturbed qualities talk out what they are thinking or feeling and because of this the audience gets clear ideas of who these people are and their struggles but also leaves room for interpretation for analysis. Even Stapleton's character is hard to judge or classify outright she is the quasiintruder but she doesn't mean to be she's just fallen for the Marshall's character. And like the best of Bergman and other naturalistic theater greats Woody gives long striking extremely wellwritten passagesmonologues of dialog.Lest I forget to mention the incalculable contribution of Gordon Willis. Responsible for the cinematography of all of Woody's late 70'searly 80's films he helps to bring out the intricate detailed and sometimes obvious angles and prolonged shots of the rooms of the houses and apartments giving minimal or nexttono light in the darkerthemed scenes and really giving a boost to the subject matter. Some may see this and almost take it for parody and it could have been if the actors played it just a step wrong or if the writing wasn't as honest. But by the last shot of the film the three sisters in profile and in complete mourningcontemplation one senses Willis bringing out the fullon artist of Woody. It's a beautiful shot a little selfaware but engaging after a film that has done that just right.".

It's not without a point that critics note this homages of Bergman have shown in many of his films Love  Death Husbands  Wives Deconstructing Harry etc. But one must not neglect that if Woody connects to Bergman Bergman connects with the masters of naturalistic drama like Ibsen and Strindberg and that as a writer Woody has been influenced by dozens and dozens of authors of literature and theater. With Interiors his script and direction is is observant and is able to get under the skin of a viewer by giving the characters under the upperclass veneer attributes that aren't too oblique or cold. It is definitely not one of the Woody films I would recommend to someone first getting into his films the comedies are best for that but it is a great start to the sort of section of films that Woody does there are two I consider his entertaining sophisticated comedies which he often is the star of being one and the other being his dramas.One thing is hard to dispute the cast that is assembled is all pro who physically look the parts and emotionally sink into them as real people not caricatures. Flyn Joey and Renata are daughters of a wealthy wouldbe lawyer EG Marshall and her perfectionist needy and mentally troubled homemaker Eve Geraldine Page perhaps her best. After their separation Eve tries to make it on her own still controlling still clinging to the children who will stay around her which is Joey but has a breakdown and attempted suicide. Soon after this Marshall's character finds love elsewhere played by Maureen Stapleton also a very good performance a fascinating outsider in the midst of the family's reaching for real love and happiness. This brings even more turmoil on the sisters who each deal with their own emotionalpsychological problems with themselves and their significant others.It's hard to point out who's performances are the 'best' in the film as each contribute something different and intense. Keaton is particularly interesting as a writer with a drunken writer husband who can't seem to come to grips with herself amid the looming presence of her mother. Hurt's character is similar in this vein but dealing with something a little more existential I think. Most of the characters curiously not Eva who for this reason is a little more affecting and arresting in her quiet disturbed qualities talk out what they are thinking or feeling and because of this the audience gets clear ideas of who these people are and their struggles but also leaves room for interpretation for analysis. Even Stapleton's character is hard to judge or classify outright she is the quasiintruder but she doesn't mean to be she's just fallen for the Marshall's character. And like the best of Bergman and other naturalistic theater greats Woody gives long striking extremely wellwritten passagesmonologues of dialog.Lest I forget to mention the incalculable contribution of Gordon Willis. Responsible for the cinematography of all of Woody's late 70'searly 80's films he helps to bring out the intricate detailed and sometimes obvious angles and prolonged shots of the rooms of the houses and apartments giving minimal or nexttono light in the darkerthemed scenes and really giving a boost to the subject matter. Some may see this and almost take it for parody and it could have been if the actors played it just a step wrong or if the writing wasn't as honest. But by the last shot of the film the three sisters in profile and in complete mourningcontemplation one senses Willis bringing out the fullon artist of Woody. It's a beautiful shot a little selfaware but engaging after a film that has done that just right.";

Look the boyfriend's mother remarks The shiksa's baked us a Presbyterian Pie! Ladies and Gents this is Woody Allen's Presbyterian Pie. In Interiors we see but only through his direction for once Allen on stilts attempting to reach the stature of a truly great director Ingmar Bergman. It's interesting to think that while Bergman is said to be one of Allen's favorite directors so much of the Swede's influence at least in this movie seems to have proved indigestible or incomprehensible to Woody. At least that's the only way I can explain the clumsy aping pastichelike quality to the to the long drawnout silences and the improbable intellibabble dialogue. I live in a college town and I never sat through a dinner like that. Geraldine Page makes what was at that time a rare appearance as an icegreyclad snow queen in her ice palace in Allen's sexobsessed Freudian universe her problems stem from this frigidity first and the same lack of any real feeling extends to her daughters. I would suggest that not only has this character lost her lifeit seems to have been stolen from her in some mysterious way by her husband and daughtersbut the character itself down to mannerisms and hairstyle is simply a late Bibi Andersson impersonation and as such is enough to throw even the most avid student of films into a tailspin since the character doesn't derive so much from the plot such as it is as from the directorwriter's idea of what a Bergmanesque matriarch should look and sound like. So there is no real explanation for her actions or her character. Ms. Page's Oscar nomination for the role can be traced to the rarity of her film roles and her stage reputation coupled with Hollywood's obsessive need to legitimize itself as Real Theater. Diane Keaton Mary Beth Hurt and Sam Waterston give delectably pained and studied performances. There is much sighing clenching of jaws and twisting of heads as if the characters' neuroses had somehow translated themselves into virulent forms of neuralgic palsy. They can't think the cricks out of their necks however just as they can't make the dialogue sound real. This movie was a step forward for Allen in that normally his characters did little more than talk copulate think about it and talk some more. Here they cut out the sex part and simply think think and talk and talk. About nothing you or I would be the least bit interested in. Since Allen in long view seems to be something of an anomaly a deep thinker inside a basically shallow person the characters say things like of someone's cologne It permeates the house. Honestly has anyone ever sat in your presence and used the word permeates in conversation? But what can you expect of characters who show more emotion over the breaking of a vase than they do while fending off being raped attending their father's wedding or their mother's funeral? And notice every single review of this film you'll ever read mentions that vase it's almost the only thing that happens in this film. Maureen Stapleton as others have mentioned is the salvation of this movie and as a vulgarian is completely outdone probably unintentionally by Page what could be more vulgar than smashing the prayer candles in a church or appearing at the scene of your exhusband's wedding in order to commit suicide? I have to admit I was really rooting for the old girl to catch that undertow since the gaspipe hadn't done the job. I vote for typing this movie as a kind of fantasy one where a New York comic is transformed into a Northern European auteur making yet another memorable filmwhich this film some 20 years after the buzz has worn off simply is not. Keep trying Woody but try to be more like yourself.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are no excuses for this trite and excruciating examination into the lives of a mentally and emotionally imbalanced family poorly served up as a serious film.Watching Interiors is like watching a painful therapy session of the disintegration of a dysfunctional family behind oneway glass. You as the viewer have no say about the things that they do. At times the film goes at such slow pace it's like watching paint dry.There really isn't much of a plot here. Critics and 'high intellects' may try and dress this up in praise and fancy words but when you remove all the frills and fancy wrapping there's not much left but an empty dusty room with a few dead flies.The plot or what there is of it concerns a recently separated wealthy couple E.G. Marshall and Geraldine Page their three spoilt brat daughters who are now grown up Mary Beth Hurt Diane Keaton and Kristin Griffith their spouses Richard Jordan and Sam Waterson and their father's new lover and wifetobe Maureen Stapleton.That's the plot. Geraldine Page in her most boring and onedimensional role throughout her elegant film history parades around on the screen in New York socialite fashions murmuring constantly like a blithering idiot about designs and colors while clinging to a false and rather stupid hope that E.G. Marshall will return to her.E.G. Marshall on the other hand has been driven away by her psychotic isolation and crumbling dementia into the arms of a 'lower class' lady portrayed by the always dependable and talented Maureen Stapleton. Why Stapleton has always shone in 'supporting roles' and never a main one is beyond me. She totally stole the movie here.She appears in one scene wearing a striking red dress clashing against the sterile antiseptic and clinical tones that Page applied to the beach house where she once lived. As artistic Woody Allen may have intended this vision to be it was the only scene in this entire trash that actually made me appreciate anything about this movie.The daughters themselves are on an entirely different page altogether. Not one of them were worth feeling any bit sympathetic for. They were all selfindulged spoilt egotistical vile brats that made you wish very bad things upon them. Mary Beth Hurt's character was the worst. She was just a very disgusting and ugly being revolting on the inside and not very attractive on the out. She spends most of her time pacing back and forth spouting wit and wisdom like she were quoting from the book of high intellect itself seriously as someone else pointed out I have never heard ANYONE talk like she does in this movie.Diane Keaton is surprisingly wasted in an unsympathetic role where she feels that Mary Beth Hurt is the favorite daughter and that she herself is just a foil to absorb all of her mother's misfortunes and bad luck. Whenever her mother suffers a nervous breakdown Diane Keaton receives the brunt of it. Whenever her mother needs to complain about whether or not their father will be driven back into her arms Diane Keaton receives the brunt of it. It never ends. Keaton herself is supposed to be some sort of a struggling poet with a onehitwonder author for a spouse. Between the two of them they sit around waxing fancy words and witty dialect you're not sure whether you've just stumbled upon a reenactment of the last days of Socrates.The third daughter Kristin Griffith is the youngest. She is a struggling actress relegated to thirdrate television shows. She is barely around hence the reason why Keaton and Hurt receive most of their mother's anguish. When she does make an appearance she doesn't offer anything to the film other than to appear in a ridiculous scene where she is nearly raped by Richard Jordan's character during a drunken confrontation.For about an hour and a half Keaton Hurt and Page spend most of the time talking out of their behinds concerning their feelings and anguish about why they are the way they are and how screwed up their lives are. Hurt's character especially is the most grating as an unemployed nohoper who takes out all of her misfortunes on her poor deranged mother and anyone else who has the misfortune of being around to listen to her whine and whine and whine.My hopes were brightened when Maureen Stapleton enters the picture. She is a kind lady caught in the middle of this psychotic mess along with E.G. Marshall who is rather clueless to his children's unbalanced emotions and their despise towards both him and their mother. I actually never grasped why they were so angry. They didn't have a poor upbringing their parents gave them everything they ever wanted except maybe a hug? and yet they're convinced that it's the end of the world and that their lives have been screwed up forever. Give me a break!The worst part about all of this is the fact that despite all the anger anguish hopeless despair and sadness Woody Allen manages to drag it out for nearly two hours and it feels like it too every second of every minute. But between every overexaggerated emotion that is acted out there is at least a 10 minute boring part in the middle that you have to sit through.That is how the DVD should have been made. Each chapter could be skipped via 'scene of emotion' ie. Chapter 1  When Mary Beth Hurt screams. Chapter 2  When Diane Keaton wails about why she's got it so bad. Chapter 3  When Mary Beth Hurt whines about etc.There is small satisfaction in the final scenes where Geraldine Page's character expires by taking a walk into the ocean but other than that  I was so glad when the closing credits appeared. The movie just never seems to stop. There really is no pleasure in watching Interiors unless you get your kicks out of watching rich dysfunctional families cry about why the world is so unfair.Please. It may be the year 2004 but I can guarantee you that times weren't THAT different in 1978. This movie is an exercise in patience. The acting is overdone and the direction is just cheesy. Woody overdoes the 'artsy fartsy' crap by trying to see how many times he can artfully shoot a scene with the heads of the three sisters in the one scene. It's laughable really and that's the only slightly amusing thing about this boring drivel.How this film got all those Oscar nominations and critical applause is beyond me. It's almost like the critics felt that if they didn't praise this movie they would be thought of as either unhip or they just didn't get it. Sad really.My Rating  2 out of 10".

	schema:headline " A Dysfunctional Family Wrapped in Frigid Austerity Makes for Allen's SoSerious Drama";
	schema:reviewBody "It's pretty obvious that Woody Allen was so resistant in being confined as a comedy filmmaker that in the throes of his success with the wondrous Annie Hall he felt a need to make an berserious drama in the Ingmar Bergman mode. This 1978 Chekhovian family drama is the result and it is alternately affecting and exasperating. The key problem is that Allen presents such a hermetically sealed world of intellectuals and artistic souls that the interactions among the characters feel pointed and selfconscious. He has obviously since learned that his best films Manhattan Hannah and Her Sisters are served most by his particular balance between comedy and drama.The story concerns an upscale New York family reacting to the news that patriarch Arthur wants to leave his psychologically unstable wife Eve just released from a sanitarium. They have three daughters all of whom are grappling with their own problems. Eldest sister Renata is a successful poet stuck in a volatile marriage to Frederick a fellow writer whose lack of commercial success has merely heightened his jealousy and paranoia. Middle daughter Joey is Arthur's favorite but she is unable to figure out what to do with her life and her constant flailing frustrates everyone around her in spite of the patience of her boyfriend Michael. Youngest daughter Flyn is the beautiful emotionally isolated one who moved to Hollywood to become a semisuccessful actress.They all respond to their mother Eve's neediness in different ways and the inevitable turning point comes when Arthur finalizes the divorce and remarries this time to a passionate funloving widow named Pearl. Even though Gordon Willis' beigedominated cinematography and the frigid almosttooperfect art direction by Mel Bourne and Daniel Robert lend the extreme austerity for which Allen seems to be striving the acting is what makes this film dramatically effective. Mary Beth Hurt gives a brave performance as Joey capturing all the inadequacy and wounded rejection her character feels. Maureen Stapleton is a breath of fresh air as Pearl lending an amusing earthiness and colorful indifference when she arrives late in the story.With her severe look Geraldine Page effectively lends unrelenting humorless intensity to her heavily mannered portrayal of Eve and turns her character into a hopelessly desperate victim as the story moves toward its conclusion. As Renata Diane Keaton removes all traces of the lovable Annie Hall but unfortunately comes across as the most contrived especially when her character cannot help but be patronizing to Frederick and Joey. Richard Jordan plays Frederick in broad strokes that make it difficult to empathize with his plight. Making lesser impressions are Sam Waterson as Michael Kristin Griffith as Flyn and a surprisingly understated E.G. Marshall as Arthur. Just the original trailer is included as an extra on the 2000 DVD.".

Middle daughter Joey is Arthur's favorite but she is unable to figure out what to do with her life and her constant flailing frustrates everyone around her in spite of the patience of her boyfriend Michael. Youngest daughter Flyn is the beautiful emotionally isolated one who moved to Hollywood to become a semisuccessful actress.They all respond to their mother Eve's neediness in different ways and the inevitable turning point comes when Arthur finalizes the divorce and remarries this time to a passionate funloving widow named Pearl. Even though Gordon Willis' beigedominated cinematography and the frigid almosttooperfect art direction by Mel Bourne and Daniel Robert lend the extreme austerity for which Allen seems to be striving the acting is what makes this film dramatically effective. Mary Beth Hurt gives a brave performance as Joey capturing all the inadequacy and wounded rejection her character feels. Maureen Stapleton is a breath of fresh air as Pearl lending an amusing earthiness and colorful indifference when she arrives late in the story.With her severe look Geraldine Page effectively lends unrelenting humorless intensity to her heavily mannered portrayal of Eve and turns her character into a hopelessly desperate victim as the story moves toward its conclusion. As Renata Diane Keaton removes all traces of the lovable Annie Hall but unfortunately comes across as the most contrived especially when her character cannot help but be patronizing to Frederick and Joey. Richard Jordan plays Frederick in broad strokes that make it difficult to empathize with his plight. Making lesser impressions are Sam Waterson as Michael Kristin Griffith as Flyn and a surprisingly understated E.G. Marshall as Arthur. Just the original trailer is included as an extra on the 2000 DVD.";

The results? Oscar Wilde said it best in reference to Dickens' The Old Curiosity Shop One would have to have a heart of stone not to laugh out loud at the death of Little Nell. Pretty much the same thing here. Interiors is chock full of solemnly intoned howlers. I'm afraid of my anger. Looking into the middle distance I don't like who I'm becoming. The directorial quotations to use a polite term from Bergman are close to parody. The incredibly selfinvolved family keep reminding us of how brilliant and talented they are to the point of strangulation. I read a poem of yours the other day. It was in  I don't know  The New Yorker. Oh. That was an old poem. I reworked it. Far from not caring about these people however I found them quite hilarious. Much of the dialog is exactly like the funny stuff from Allen's earlier films  only he's directed his actors to play the lines straight. Having not cast himself in the movie he has poor Mary Beth Hurt copy all of his thespian tics intonations and neurotic habits turning her into an embarrassing surrogate much like Kenneth Branagh in Celebrity.The basic plot  dysfunctional family with quietly domineering mother  seems to be lifted more or less from Bergman's Winter Light the basic family melodrama tricked up with a lot of existential angst. It all comes through in the shopworn visualaural tricks the deafening scratching of a pencil on paper the towering surf that dwarfs the people walking on the beach. etc etc.Allen's later serious films are less embarrassing but also far less entertaining.

	schema:reviewBody "Woody Allen assembled one of the most brilliant casts ever for his first serious film Interiors made in 1978. The stars are Geraldine Page Diane Keaton Mary Beth Hurt E.G. Marshall Maureen Stapleton Sam Waterston Richard Jordan and Kristin Griffith. There's great acting and there's great acting. This was GREAT acting.The story concerns basically two young women Renata Diane Keaton and Joey Mary Beth Hurt who must cope with the separation and ultimate divorce of their parents Arthur and Eve Geraldine Page and E.G. Marshall their mother's emotional and mental instability and their father's remarriage to a very different woman Maureen Stapleton. They also must deal with their feelings toward each other and toward their spouses Richard Jordan and Sam Waterston.Arthur and Eve's marriage was a cold one and one can clearly see that any happiness Eve brought Arthur had ended long ago. She's a rigid domineering woman who raised her children in an icy atmosphere where everything was in its place and perfect. As is normal in dysfunctional families the children escaped by using their imaginations  Renata is a successful poet and Joey dabbles in painting and writing unable to find her way. Guiltridden over her feelings of anger toward her mother she has tied herself to her and become responsible for her care. As is also typical of dysfunctional families there is the family member who escaped  in this case it's Flyn who lives on the other side of the country in California and is a marginally successful actress. But she hasn't escaped she's just put some distance between herself and her family. She is unhappy with her career she snorts coke.Eve lives in a delusional world where she and Arthur will reconcile she never fully accepted the separation. An interior designer she furnishes Joey's home with furnishings that are much too expensive for Joey and her husband to afford. She continually works to create a sterile tasteful perfect atmosphere dressing in the same earthy tones she uses in her designs.When Arthur introduces his new girlfriend Pearl to his daughters she is completely unlike their mother. She's a round funloving fasttalking simple down to earth woman who has buried two husbands. Renata thinks her father should be happy. Joey is furious and afraid her mother can't handle it. When Arthur asks Eve for a divorce it's in a church and Eve so quiet and measured as they talk at last goes ballistic destroying the votive candles.The end of the film is extremely powerful as Joey fights for her life  literally as well as figuratively  and is given life by her new stepmother. Perhaps now Joey can really live.This film would have made a magnificent play  in fact it still would  with its intelligent dialogue and character studies. It is a purely characterdriven script. Geraldine Page one of the greatest actresses who ever lived delivers a tremendous performance as Eve a woman who can't face reality  the death of her marriage and the anger and resentment of her children. Her disturbed character has very rapid mood swings and Page flips in and out of these peaks and valleys with ease. Everything about her is held in  her jaw is clenched her hair is tight and neat her smile is forced  you can't imagine her ever being a loving mother as indeed she wasn't.Maureen Stapleton is great as the outgoing Pearl a loving woman who can give Arthur the happiness he has long missed. She listens to a highly intellectual conversation not understanding what the heck they're talking about  Arthur's daughters can only relate on an intellectual level they know nothing else. She is incredibly out of place in the family but as the earth mother she might actually make this family a real one at last.Diane Keaton always excellent is no less excellent as the shining star Renata who must cope with an alcoholic novelist husband who believes his talent is less than hers. At the wedding reception he drunkenly attempts to rape Flyn who has been doing coke when he approaches her.Mary Beth Hurt whose last name is Hurt because she was married to William is a longtime stage actress. As Joey she is very nondescript unable to find an identity let alone a look. She is stuck in a dull marriage to a dull political scientist Waterston. It's not what she wants she seems to want Renata's creative life but with her identity so tied to her mother she can't break free. Finding out she's pregnant she becomes angry and terrified determined to get rid of it. Hurt gives a wonderful performance her big moment at the end of the film when she confronts her mother.As much as I love Woody Allen's comedy his dramas always seem to strike the right chord  Crimes and Misdemeanors and Match Point come to mind immediately. Interiors is brilliant made at a time when special effects were just starting to rule. Leave it to Allen. Not one to follow trends.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1977 Woody Allen reached new heights with his academy award winning hit Annie Hall and was rewarded with 2 Oscars. He followed it up with Interiors a dark melodramatic film with virtually no comedy without Woody Allen in front of the camera. It was rewarded with 5 academy award nominations but received ultimately terrible reviews and flopped.But the reputation Interiors has earned through the years doesn't mean it's not a masterpiece of sprawling proportions. The movie Interiors is certainly the most uncompromising drama I have ever witnessed from any American director. It's honest dark characters randomly stare into oblivion and it's just bluntly realistic without any remorse. This all came from the same guy that had Gene Wilder having sexual relationships with a sheep 5 years prior and a reputation as a pure comedic director.It's hard to recommend a film like this even to Allen fanatics. If you don't admire ART it could resemble paint drying. Allen takes an uncompromising route with these characters never letting an ounce of remorse drip from his story. But it works quite well as a study on Human behavior and what can happen to families with materialistic possessions without love. The scene with Diane Keaton's character in the analyst is one of the finest scenes from an Allen film. She confesses her own obsession with immortality through her work a huge theme in Interiors. Characters to genius to enjoy the simple things in life. They're all way too concerned with immortality. Interiors is not really a classic but it is one of the best dramas ever made. It's so bleak and melodramatic but I loved every minute of it. Allen's a genius when it comes to analyzing his characters. Unlike Annie Hall Manhattan Hannah and her Sisters Crimes and Misdemeanors etc Interiors doesn't contain enough mixture of comedy and drama to keep you interested in the characters development. The pure melodrama dooms these characters from the beginning leaving you without any hope in them changing. I still give Interiors 9 stars for the blunt honestly but I refuse to give it classic status on account of the relentless melodrama. I'd recommend Hannah and Her sisters for a more optimistic view on family life and immortality. Still an underrrated masterpiece.".

He was so callous to his wife. He made that speech where he said that he had done his job as a husband and father and that he was finished and ready to live alone? What a jerk! Then again maybe he was just ready. That amazing DIANE KEATON proved to the Earth that she is amazing and Woody Allen's primary actress for ALL of his movies. I would suggest this movie to anybody who wants to see a nice sad yet interesting movie about sadness.";

I do know however that just recently there have been a couple cute French spy films starring Jean Dujardin. Neither film makes a lot of sense but they are entertaining and fun. Previously OSS 117 went on a mission to Egypt. Now he's being sent to Rio to track down an exNazi and obtain a list of French collaborators. Oddly this film is set in the 1960sand the previous one was set in the 50s. No matter it's the same silly old spy character.As I said above the film makes almost no sense at all. The Nazis have two Mexican luchadors wrestlers in hoods who run about Brazil in suits! This is an obvious nod to the silly Mexican luchador films where you see characters like el Santo going on dates fighting crime or monsters or making loveall in the silly hood. There are also some black Nazisagain this film never tries very hard to make sense! While it is all silly fun this is still a rather adult moviemuch more so than the one set in Cairo. There is some nudity a lot of blood and a CIA agent named Bill who uses the most amazingly colorful language I've seen in a long time. Also while it makes fun of OSS 117's racism sexism and overall arrogant xenophobic manner the easily offended might still blanch at the film. But considering he IS supposed to be an idiot his comments about Jews women and the like are all intended to point out his idiocy.In many ways this film is like an Austin Powers and Matt Helm film put together. Like Helm there is the Dean Martin music and OSS 117's manner is pure Helm. Plus like Helm Dujardin is a nice looking guy. It is a bit Powerslike....but much much more subdued and subtlesomething you'd never call a Powers film! Cute and entertaining in a very lowbrow sort of way.".

But when you have something almost as good as something really terrific it's still enough. This is enough for sure even with the novelty of the situation worn thin.The main reason is lead actor Jean Dujardin who continues his parody with aplomball the same suave selfeffacing sexist racist ridiculous mix. Instead of Muslims taking the brunt of the jokes it's Israelis. But the impossibly short skirts and general parading to a male audience is still in place for better or for worse. And lots of wonderful facial expressions and doubletakes.The rest of the production team is intact here director cinematographer composer. The time period is something like 1968 a few years later than the Nest of Spies 2006 version which is more 1963ish. So there is an entertaining but less stylish move from Mad Men territory the drinks the music the high style into counterculture territorymost notably the hippie orgy stuff. The hilarious flashbacks of the first movie on the beach have been updated to a dramatic but unfunny circus act. And so on. Which is to say this is a slightly different and slightly less movie.But it is still filled with fast and ridiculous and comic situations. The cars are great and Rio is great it seems to have been largely filmed there or some impressive CGI stuff is at work. The campy final scenes at the big Jesus statue overlooking the city is purely a Hitchcock spoof mostly Suspicion on the Statue of Liberty with a little North by Northwest at Mr. Rushmore. Oddly this is a kind of parody of something so specific a kind of postmodern reference it distracts slightly from the more generic parody that makes up the whole. However I have to quickly add that it's really well done very visually astonishing.So see this movie if you've seen the first by all means. If you have a choice and currently both are streamable on Netflix I'd start with the start and then see if you're ready for more. And hang in there because it seems there almost has to be a third. Success is hard to repress.".

Comparing this film to it's predecessor is like comparing IN LIKE FLINT to the superior OUR MAN FLINT. Of course Dujardin is still great in his very humorous and hilarious portrayal of Hubert Bonisseau De la Bath aka French Secret Agent 0SS117. I find that Dujardin's comedic style similar to Peter Sellers in which he plays OSS117 in the same way Sellers played Clouseau. I might even say Dujardin would make a better Inspector Clouseau than Steve Martin. Some of the jokes work while others feel labored and forced but Dujardin's amusing performance as well as the on location Brazilian cinematography is great. I especially liked the fact that the Nazi top villain Von Zimmel had two Mexican masked wrestlers named after Blue Demon and Santo the famous masked wrestlers of 60's Mexican Cinema. Even with it's weak spots this is a fun sequel to the original.".

I had recorded however about one year ago one of the previous films made by director Michel Hazanavicius with Dujardin in the principal role as well. Now I included it in the holidays season viewing package and it was one of the most pleasant and holidaysuited choice that I made.Lost in Rio the English title or Rio ne rpond plus happens in the 1960s when most of the novels of Jean Bruce were written. Bruce's hero Hubert Bonisseur de la Bath was a replica of James Bond one of the many created in the decades after the apparition of the novels of Jan Fleming but he had a French touch and Gallic humor which is the focus of the interpretation of director Hazanavicius. At no moment does he try to be politically correct actually under the cover of making a film about the 60s he allows to himself to mock and exaggerate stereotypes of French German and Israelis Nazis and Nazihunters macho men and babeshaped women. The result is pretty funny.Do not invest too much into probing the credibility of the story sit relax and prepare for a few good laughs. If you follow this path there are good chances to enjoy this film. Jean Dujardin is certainly a great actor and watching his work is a delight. An eyebrow a faint smile or an hysterical laugh can sustain a full gag. He is in good company. I remember some of the French comedies of the 60s and they were really good not only because they were blessing by actors such as Louis de Funes Fernandel and Bourvil but also because they allowed themselves to be crazy and ignore the social conventions. Everything was fair game for laughing. Films like this one even if they do not hit gold as The Artist contain the promise of starting to build another significant lot of comedies in the French cinema.".

I remember some of the French comedies of the 60s and they were really good not only because they were blessing by actors such as Louis de Funes Fernandel and Bourvil but also because they allowed themselves to be crazy and ignore the social conventions. Everything was fair game for laughing. Films like this one even if they do not hit gold as The Artist contain the promise of starting to build another significant lot of comedies in the French cinema.";

But here the many racist jokes towards asians called chinese Germans but mainly Jewish and Israel are just plain awful and unacceptable.Why ? Cause the movie is not in Israel China or Germany unlike the first one in Cairo Egypt.So you can't see how great Israel is as a country and Jewish people and their culture.They can't defend themselves against the main character stupid behaviors and awful racism here...And don't tell me I have no humor at all I grew up with those racist jokes that are supposed to downplay any ethnicity and color of skin but here it's anything but funny.The fact that he keeps insisting to insult Jewish and Israel people a country where they are a lot of christians and muslims as well living here in their parliament too should rejoice any anti Jewish people and is an awful propaganda for more racism towards this great country and people.By turning a racist but finally not that racist and charming character from the first movie into an absolute unfunny and disguting piece of a human being in this sequel Michel Hazanavicius shot a ball into both of his feet and ruined it forever.Do like me and buy the original adventure In Cairo Nest Of Spies and watch it again.

But there were also deep sighs a lot of bored slouching in seats and even murmurings of disgust.I liked the first film Cairo Nest of Spies. It had novelty value a zany likable hero and for a Bond fan its sendup of early Connery Bond films were uncannily accurate. It was also a masterstroke to send the suave French hero de la Bath a colonialist and sexist to the Middle East to mix with dignified locals Arab nationalists and religious zealots. It's one brand of chauvinism meeting another a comedy clash of cultures.I guess I don't have to explain why it's not so funny to have de la Bath make comments about Jews to Mossad agents referring to their beaky noses and tightness with money. But okay I will the former was more about imperialist condescension whereas antisemitic attitudes usually comes from a far nastier place. Plus there's also that thing called the holocaust. I know we're meant to be laughing AT the guy but even so.What's more Jean Dujardin lacks that innocent sparkle that made his offensiveness less obnoxious in the original film. In the first film the hero was an appealing counter to today's PC behaviour. Here as he's such a boor you start to realise why such attitudes went out of fashion and you sympathise with the Jewish heroine who rolls her eyes.It doesn't help that a fair number of the gags especially at the beginning are based on wordplay and puns that don't travel well despite the best efforts of the translators. Why is his code name Flantier so hilarious? To be fair the film acknowledges that the French never really won World War Two that it was a myth put about to bolster national pride and that many Frenchmen were collaborators  in that context the movie matches the revisionist French attitude seen in films like Cache Hidden. There's some lovely scenery and the climax on Christ the Redeemer is worthy of a real Bond film. But for long stretches it's not spoofing Bond films rather the awful Bond spoofs that dogged the 1960s. And the jokes are so lame that the thin line between spoofing awful Bond spoofs and being an awful Bond spoof is virtually nonexistent. As for the hippie culture clash well it's all a bit Austin Powers.My advice is wait for the DVD if you must see this it's not 9 well spent.".

Many intricate flashbacks lead the viewer through the family's history up to the present importance of the gathering.  Ironically everything turned out exactly the opposite of what earlier years promised to bring.  When the mother an opera singer dies both son and daughter are faced with the reality of what they have become.  This not only puts stress on them but also challenges their relationships.

	schema:reviewBody "Zurdo seems to be one of a kind in Mexican's film history. Or at least a film of a kind that had not been seen for a long long time. It is a fantasy movie aimed to all audiences without being dumb or preachy without stereotypes or vulgarity it is an intelligent and original movie that delivers nothing but fun and good entertainment.Carlos Salcs a young director with a solid career as an editor of other wellknown Mexican movies makes a simple thing like playing marbles the topic of his first feature with amazing results. Alexandro lex Perea nicknamed Zurdo is a young kid in a futuristic fantasy version of a Mexican small town. He has an extraordinary ability to play marbles and his great skill at the game doesn't go unnoticed. A mysterious stranger Eugenio Derbez from a neighbor town challenges Zurdo to a duel against the champion of his town with a enormous prize in cash. The town makes Zurdo to accept and soon he becomes the center of the town's attention as everyone wants to make a profit of Zurdo's ability.With big influence from Japanese comic books and Mexican folklore Salcs paints his futuristic world with great care for details and despite its low budget he creates a captivating world that also mimics Mexico's sociology. The always present theme of the corrupt government in Mexican movies is here too in the shape of Romo Alejandro Camacho a man who pretends to use Zurdo's talent for evil purposes while he abuses Zurdo's community. As one would expect marbles play a great part in the movie not only as a plot device but also as a metaphor. While the movie is aimed to kids it raises good points to the adult audience.Alx Perea is great as Zurdo as well as the other child actors something noteworthy as it is kind of rare to find this on a movie. Alejandro Camacho does his usual good take on an evil character like the parts that made him famous on Mexican TV soap operas and Eugenio Derbez surprises with a subtle serious performance far away from his usual overthetop comedy.Probably because of the background the cast the movie at times feels like a fantasy version of a soap opera and while this only noticeable in a scene or two it shows that Salcs has a bit of too much influence from that kind of TV shows. Other than that the movie is flawless even its CG effects look very good for the budget and while I'm not a fan of electronic music Paul Van Dyk's soundtrack fits the movie perfectly and has a soul that most music of this kind doesn't have.Zurdo is the perfect movie to watch with the family and one that sadly has been overlooked when speaking of recent Mexican cinema. It is very entertaining and never gets boring. The story is very original and well constructed with characters that are likable and believable. It is a different experience to common Latin American movies and definitely one of the best Mexican movies ever made. 910".

The key is as follows Zurdo is essentially about two years worth of weekly Mexican futuristic soap opera compacted into featurelength format. The plot and the setting are nominally fantastic but this structure is entirely filled with classical soap opera content. The beauty of this setup has dawned on me only towards the end of the film. Every soapoperatearjerkingscene every sob every clich have been compacted at a ratio of about 51. There are no pauses between the closely intercut scenes sometimes the viewer is rushed between three different locations within a minute. The effect is that every scene gesture and word become a reference to themselves. What allows the director to do this is that the elements soap opera are immediately recognizable no time need be spent on the development.If not only a postmodernist treatment of the soap opera genre it might well be that Zurdo is the highbandwidth soap opera of the future.".

	schema:reviewBody "Its saddening that a lot of people have just voted '1' just to ruin the rating of this film on IMDb. I doubt if anyone really believes it is that bad as there are very few films that I have chosen to watch I would give ratings below 2. Equally a few people have given it 10 to counteract the 1's sadly they are out numbered. I have rated it 7 as I believe it had its highlights but also a few shortcomings.I don't think you need to be a Christian to watch the film and not even black I can remember seeing only one white character that spent more than two seconds on screen what a change. One requirement might be to enjoy music though.The film starts with a very good mass choir rendition of a popular gospel tune 'Our God is an Awesome God' has about 5 minutes of screen time over the opening credits and later there are at least 2 other performances of equal duration. Sadly the performance by Fred Hammmond of Commissioned fame was interspersed with acting. There was also singing from Yolanda Adams and Tamyra Grey former American idol contestant.As the story opens Pastor Fred Taylor has a thriving church in Atlanta which his son David is leading in praise and worship. David's mother dies and he blames Fred for never being there for them. David leaves the church and 15 years later becomes a successful RB Singer with a hit on the charts called Let Me Undress You. David's friend Rev Charles Frank Idris Elbawho was also in youth ministry stays behind at the church becomes an associate minister and is now in line to take over the church which happens to now be having financial problems. Pastor Fred develops cancer and David returns home to be with his dad and the rest of the film focuses on his internal dilemma whether he should focus on his music career or the church and the leadership battle between Frank  who has now developed a great ego  and Associate Pastor Terrance Hunter Donnie McClurkin.Boris Kodjoe once voted as one of the 50 most beautiful people on the planet was very good in the lead role as David Taylor however there were a few areas where his acting came across as being stiff when he was out of his comfort zone. I was impressed by his acting when he was leading the choir. Omar Gooding was also excellent as the Managersidekick. Other members of the cast were very good including Idris Elba Clifton Powell and Donnie McClurkin.The movie attempted to explore church politics in a very realistic way however I was a bit disappointed at the sudden reversal of Frank. Perhaps it will be explored further in the deleted scenes on the DVD. And to the reviewer from earlier  yes some of us do want to see the deleted scenes.I must admit I don't see links to the fighting temptations as that was mainly a comedy and this was a powerful drama.My main criticism is that they tried too hard to give the film a happy ending that would please all but it didn't strike me as being very realistic. Overall though a very good film worth watching.".

If you want to learn what it really means to worship this is a very good film and worth seeing.I have to add one of the things that impressed me most in this film was how the people at the church and not just the choir worshiped with their whole body.

If you haven't been paying attention lately anything that comes out of Hollywood with any kind of a religious message is going to be attacked no matter the quality of the movie.We should all remember the savaging of The Passion before it even hit the theaters. People were tearing that movie apart long before they had even seen it. The experience of this movie is no different.Jim Rohn said many years ago that good will always be attacked by evil. Always. There is absolutely no reason for this film to be rated 2.9. While I wouldn't give it a 10 I would have rated it 7 or 8. But the story that this movie tells is that of good people struggling with their faults and trying to rise above them. But they try to do this rising by calling on Jesus for strength and there are a lot of people in this country and around the world for that matter that can't stomach the thought of anyone turning their hearts towards God and asking for His help.Those who were expecting some big budget glitzy Hollywood blockbuster were going to be disappointed. The budget on this film was five million dollars. That kind of budget wouldn't even buy twenty minutes of screen time from someone like Jim Carrey or George Clooney let alone shoot the whole movie. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was budgeted at twenty million which is ultralow budget by current Hollywood standards. Does that mean that it was four times better than The Gospel? Not by a long shot. I'll watch The Gospel again but I don't think I'll feel any remorse or loss if I never see Eternal Sunshine again. And a lot of Jim's current movies will leave me quite satisfied just not that one.So you ask why this film is rated so low here? This is your answer. Good will always come under attack from evil. Always.".

People were tearing that movie apart long before they had even seen it. The experience of this movie is no different.Jim Rohn said many years ago that good will always be attacked by evil. Always. There is absolutely no reason for this film to be rated 2.9. While I wouldn't give it a 10 I would have rated it 7 or 8. But the story that this movie tells is that of good people struggling with their faults and trying to rise above them. But they try to do this rising by calling on Jesus for strength and there are a lot of people in this country and around the world for that matter that can't stomach the thought of anyone turning their hearts towards God and asking for His help.Those who were expecting some big budget glitzy Hollywood blockbuster were going to be disappointed. The budget on this film was five million dollars. That kind of budget wouldn't even buy twenty minutes of screen time from someone like Jim Carrey or George Clooney let alone shoot the whole movie. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was budgeted at twenty million which is ultralow budget by current Hollywood standards. Does that mean that it was four times better than The Gospel? Not by a long shot. I'll watch The Gospel again but I don't think I'll feel any remorse or loss if I never see Eternal Sunshine again. And a lot of Jim's current movies will leave me quite satisfied just not that one.So you ask why this film is rated so low here? This is your answer. Good will always come under attack from evil. Always.";

However this movie was a positive all the way around.It was great to see the restoration of the bishop's son as well as the restoration of his friendship with his old friend.The ambition of Frank which almost destroyed him withered when he found his faith again. It was a tremendous positive to see his wife and him adopting when unable to have children by blood. Contrary to what some may think this happens a lot but church people tend not to make a big public deal of it. I know of several Christians including a pastor who have chosen to adopt when they found they could not conceive children.When you compare this film to those that usually come out with drugs violence and other trash you will find that this movie is such a breath of fresh air and pleasing to God.".

I must admit when I went to this movie I was not expecting much but this movie is incredible.It is a modern day retelling of the story of the prodigal son. The acting and the script of this movie are just incredible. The whole stage is set around a son played by Borris Kojo who faces the death of his mother and he turns his back on God and turns to RB music. Just at the pinnacle of his career he gets news that his father is sick. This is where the plot thickens.The movie starts off with just great music and very interesting handheld camera shots. The movie is packed with uplifting gospel music from all of today's hottest artists. One of my favorites from this movie is Victory by Yolonda Adams. You can check out The Gospel website. Which is GospelMovieDotCom Because you can't put links in your reviews. But check it out.This movie is surprisingly good and it's just one of those family films you want to watch over and over again. I give this movie and 8 because it had some areas they could've tighten up but I do believe the goal of this movie was achieved.WARNING Bring some Kleneex with you to this film!".

However the twist in this is the fact that even though Frank is now the the head of his church he has forgotten that his main mission is to spread the word of the Lord. However he uses his position to pretty much alienate everyone including his wife. This film pretty much looks as if it pretty much speaks to a lot of people on a lot of different levels. One is obviously the music and the other is the moral dilemmas that many of us face in our lives. It also takes a hard look at a lot of preachers out there who like Frank use their positions to promote themselves and don't care about the needs of their congregations.

I felt the anointing of God's spirit coming off the theater screen while I was sitting in my seat. I raised my hands Praising God right along with the movie.There were moments I did cry  especially during the time that the son David was at the bedside of his dieing Father! I felt like I was in church. I praise God that years ago though raised in a Jewish Family at age 19 my then boyfriend took me to an a Holiness Church in South Central all African Amercian church! A few months later I got saved.! Still living for Jesus today! Thank you for a great movie. Be sure to get the word out in ALL CHURCHES that believe Jesus is Lord!

I raised my hands Praising God right along with the movie.There were moments I did cry  especially during the time that the son David was at the bedside of his dieing Father! I felt like I was in church. I praise God that years ago though raised in a Jewish Family at age 19 my then boyfriend took me to an a Holiness Church in South Central all African Amercian church! A few months later I got saved.! Still living for Jesus today! Thank you for a great movie. Be sure to get the word out in ALL CHURCHES that believe Jesus is Lord! I pray that you get the movie distributed to more theaters.";

I do understand that everyone's entitled to their opinion and all...I mean I don't like everything Ebert says is good stuff...so with that in mind if you like music if you have an ounce of Christian faith you'll enjoy this film. If you've been to a church in the south I mean a full gospel church you'll be able to relate tremendously...enjoy!

	schema:headline " Glorious Gospel Music frames retelling of The Prodigal Son";
	schema:reviewBody "The Gospel tells a simple story that doesn't twist and turn but rather falls naturally from the believable characters created in Rob Hardy's screenplay and under his direction. Hardy has wisely filled his movie with absolutely glorious Gospel music created by electrifying choirs and real Gospel greats like Fred Hammond and Yolanda Adams. The movie is never more than one scene away from one with glorious music and as soon as I finish this review I'm going to order the soundtrack.The story is not difficult to follow. Clifton Powell as Bishop Fred Taylor has built a thriving church in Atlanta and he is a devoted Pastor. So devoted that his son leaves home as a young man when the Bishop's wife passes away while the Bishop is conducting church services. In the opening scene we see the son David telling the Bishop I hate you. You always have time for the church but you never have time for us on his way out of the hospital.15 years later we see that David Taylor has become a hiphop singer right on the cusp of megastardom. He's played by Boris Kodjoe as a handsome brooding man. He has a manager played by Omar Gooding with more than a slight resemblance to older brother Cuba named Wesley who keeps D.T. supplied with gigs and women. David gets a phone call from his father's secretary Ernestine played by Aloma Wright who tells him that the Bishop has become ill and could David come home.Against Wesley's wishes David interrupts his tour as it's gaining momentum to return to the church where he finds his teenaged friend Charles Frank has become a Reverend as well  associate pastor to the Bishop married to his cousin Charlene and the heir apparent to the church.The Reverend Charles Frank is an arrogant man who is quick with a discouraging word for his wife. Another associate Minister Hunter played well by singer Donnie McClurkin can't understand when the Bishop decides to turn the pulpit over to the brash Reverend Frank but agrees to stay with the church at the request of the Bishop.This is the part of the movie that builds sympathy for wayward son David who returns home with different eyes and sees the noble charitable work that his father has been doing for decades. He accompanies his father to a retirement home where he's told that the Bishop always comes at least twice a week even though everyone there knows he doesn't have time for it.The movie builds as a battle between the worldly David who returns home as the performer of sexy secular songs but builds in determination to not lose the legacy of his father and Reverend Frank who stayed true to the church and the Bishop but now seems to have lost the vision of anything except himself in the church spotlight.By the end of the film the words and body language of all the characters are that it's all good and that the strife that has filled the hour and a half preceding is resolved. We know that real life doesn't work that quickly but we can believe that in real life it may work out just as well. The music helps. It's reassuring to see a mainstream film made about people of faith and their realworld struggles. If not for the fact that the final scene seems out of place with several rapid changes of heart I'd give the film 5 stars. As it is it's well worth your time  I'd say mandatory if you want to hear some glorious gospel music.".

Now living with his veterinarian brother Fran in Buenos Aires he cannot get out of his mind a brief encounter he experienced at an airport. Nico a rather shy youth does not capitalize on the occasion by asking the girl her name. Her memory haunts him.As fate would have it Luchi the girl at the airport happens to bring her pet rabbit to Fran for a checkup. Nico makes all kinds of excuses in order to get near her. His only friend is Santi an aimless youth who loves stealing his mother prescription drugs to get high. What is the attraction between them? It appears Santi is what Nico is not. His boldness in stealing snacks from convenience stores does not even get him in trouble but Nico feels bad about what his friend is doing. Nico is dragged against his will as his friend steals CDs or even rob a drug store where he is in cahoots with one employee to get drugs that will be sold for a profit.The relationship between the brothers is not exactly a happy one. Nico would like to see the house in Valdivia their parents owned to be sold so the brother can expand on the vet's office and give them some badly needed cash. Fran is reluctant to do it. Nico has suffered the death of his parents in a small plane crash. Going now aimlessly with the only companionship of Santi does not satisfy him. Falling in love with Luchi is easy but his wish to be with her is short lived as she has the opportunity of going away to Switzerland.Fran suggests a trip back to Valdivia to Nico. That way he can paid what is owned and see about putting the house on the market. Fran even suggests to invite Santi along. His friend is too far gone into his own history of crime to fulfill his drug dependency. Sitting at a beach the two friends are trying to relax. Nico turns on his Walkman and Santi begins telling his friend how sorry he is for what he has put his pal through but it is too late Nico cannot hear Santi's painful confession. Directed by Ezequiel Acuna Como Un Avion Estrellado is a reflective film an ode to friendship and to love found and lost. This film surprises in that the creator has done wonders with what appears to be an extreme low budget limited resources but with a lot of love on Mr. Acuna's part. He knows the rhythms of the big city and the petty crimes young people get involved with. The other main theme is hopelessness for Nico in a situation he cannot overcome either at home with his pal Santi or even the love he feels for Luchi that gets nowhere.There are outstanding appearances by Ignacio Rogers Manuela Martelli Santiago Pedrero and Carlos Echevarria. The four young actors do an amazing job for the director. Mr. Rogers and Mr. Pedrero have the meatiest roles of Nico and Santi. Both are sensational. The beautiful Manuela Martelli is compelling as Luchi.".

The trip is a part of their psychological maturation. The main merit of this movie is in its psychologically unusually accurate and emotionally moving portrait of the intrapsychic teenage turmoil. The director Karin Babinsk is a master in this respect and the performance of the actors favorably compares to the majority of Hollywood films. The key protagonist played by Marie Dolezalov unsuccessfully attempts to overcome or firmly suppress her intense erotic attraction to women. In the first part of the film she vehemently denies her orientation when queried in this respect by a more experienced more mature and overtly lesbian lady. She experiences intense frustrations in her intrapsychic struggle even attempts suicide but remains kind to her friends even when these contemplate rejecting her after detecting her erotic preference. These other girls in her group also struggle with growing up pains and with adolescent impulsiveness and selfdoubts. The film excellently reflects their adolescent search for a fulfilling friendship and for a more satisfactory definition of oneself. The film culminates when the protagonist Marie Dolezalov finally again encounters and befriends the more mature and overtly lesbian lady this meeting helps her to develop a stronger selfacceptance.".

	schema:headline " Just because it's no Chinatown doesn't make this film bad";
	schema:reviewBody "The Two Jakes and The Godfather 3 were released in the second half of 1990 and both films proved that sometimes it's best not to tamper with classics. This is not necessarily because sometimes a sequel can't compliment a classic but because no matter what you do there's no way to avoid comparing the new versions to the old. And the final chapter of the Godfather trilogy is vastly inferior to the first two. And Two Jakes is vastly inferior to Chinatown. But since Chinatown and the first two Godfathers are among the best films every made that's a pretty pointless comparison. Just as The Godfather 3 stands on its own as a very sturdy and interesting piece of filmmaking Two Jakes also works on its own merits. It's confusing overlong a full ten minutes more than the original and never fully gels but it's also passionate intelligent filmmaking. Go figure.In his autobiography producer Robert Evans refers to Robert Towne's script for Two Jakes as basically only halffinished. It was halffinished when they started shooting halffinished when they made it halfway through the shoot and it pretty much feels halffinished in the final product.  This is a movie where characters wander in and out and a full twothirds of the storylines go essentially unresolved. The grand climax of the film and trust me I'm not spoiling anything is an evidentiary hearing for heavens sakes! And I couldn't really explain the plot if I wanted to but here's the quick summary It's fifteen years after Chinatown and Jake Gittes Jack Nicholson has become older fatter and a good deal more bitter. He's now an Investigator respected throughout LA but he's still haunted by his experiences with the Mulwrays especially the late Evelyn. The film begins with a jealous husband Jake Berman Harvey Keitel storming into a hotel room and killing his wife's lover with Jake listening in the next room. Of course you know the crime probably wasn't entirely about love or lust and that money probably had something to do with it. Money history and oil actually. And it spins in circles from there. It's easy to notice that the film slacks off at around the halfway point. It's then that you realize just how tight Robert Towne's Chinatown script was. Even at a shred over two hours every word counts every gesture every twist. Two Jakes is flabby in comparison. The dialogue is pleasantly hardboiled and the actors enjoy delivering it but the resolutions of the various mysteries mostly fall flat. You either see them coming or don't understand when they arrive. It's to Towne and director Jack Nicholson's credit that the film ends on a number of satisfying grace notes.Nicholson's direction is almost never the source of the film's flaws. And this is legitimately high praise in a film as twisting and convoluted as this. Of course he again makes you appreciate the brilliant economy of Roman Polanski's direction of Chinatown a film with an immeasurable amount of class. Nicholson produces several wonderful moments including a beautiful pull shot from the ocean to a teatime conversation with Kahn who Chinatown fans will avidly remember. Nicholson and director of photography Vilmos Zsigmond capture a Los Angeles of burnt out dreams on the brink of overdevelopment and overexpansion. The film has noir stylings but it respectfully looks different from Chinatown.Nicholson's performance is more a study of what has happened to the actor since Chinatown rather than what has happened to the character. Because Jack was less of an icon when Chinatown was made the original Jake Gittes is one of his least iconic performances. By the time he won his Oscar the next year for One Flew Over The Cuckoo's nest Nicholson had already become JACK in all caps and he hasn't looked back. In Two Jakes Jake Gittes has become JACK. There's no getting around it. However there's also no getting around the fact that Nicholson is a great actor and even if his performances are frequently variations on a theme it's a pretty super theme.Two Jakes is peppered with supporting performances of varying degrees of depth. Harvey Keitel has never been better as the second of the two Jakes. His character is emotionally complicated and perhaps the only person in the film besides Gittes who gets to go through a character arc.  He plays it wonderfully. The femmes fatale in the film as played by Madeline Stowe and Meg Tilly are less and more complicated than they seem. Ruben Blade Richard Farnsworth and Eli Wallach provide capable support when they're given anything to do.The fact is that like the Godfather 3 if you came upon Two Jakes with a completely open mind you'd find it a complicated thriller vastly more substantial than most films of the genre. The fact that it's got its flaws that it'll never compare to Chinatown are the basis for a 710 rating.".

	schema:headline " A Surprisingly Underappreciated Sequel";
	schema:reviewBody "Knowing this Chinatown sequel's detested reputation I was too interested in seeing a movie directed by Jack Nicholson to turn away. I was surprised to find that it is very underappreciated. Nicholson is quite an inventive if a little showoffy director. His confident helming of the very late sequel to a highly revered contemporary classic is full of interesting shots and his performance realistically portrays an older wiser Jake Gittes who has been seasoned with philosophies on the pain and importance of the past.It is not simply on account of Nicholson. Robert Towne's own continuation of his predecessor is quite creative. Harvey Keitel plays the second Jake who has hired the initial Jake to catch his wife cheating on him redhanded. In the course of the sting Keitel up and shoots the adulterous lover who turns out to be his real estate partner. Nicholson is now under intense scrutiny for his unwitting part in the crime and has to figure out if it was justifiable homicide or straight murder. The case proceeds to elude to California's booming oil industry as well as his own past after he stumbles upon a wire recording during the investigation that mentions the daughter of Faye Dunaway's illfated character in the last film.The Two Jakes to me can stand on its own with Chinatown. Polanski directed the first film much much differently than Nicholson addresses this followup. I don't believe in the case of Chinatown a sequel needs to be a comparable continuation. Making a second installment sixteen years later allows a lot of license for it to be its own beast. Some such sequels done that way are disasters. The Two Jakes stays afloat.

	onyx:emotionText "Knowing this Chinatown sequel's detested reputation I was too interested in seeing a movie directed by Jack Nicholson to turn away. I was surprised to find that it is very underappreciated. Nicholson is quite an inventive if a little showoffy director. His confident helming of the very late sequel to a highly revered contemporary classic is full of interesting shots and his performance realistically portrays an older wiser Jake Gittes who has been seasoned with philosophies on the pain and importance of the past.It is not simply on account of Nicholson. Robert Towne's own continuation of his predecessor is quite creative. Harvey Keitel plays the second Jake who has hired the initial Jake to catch his wife cheating on him redhanded. In the course of the sting Keitel up and shoots the adulterous lover who turns out to be his real estate partner. Nicholson is now under intense scrutiny for his unwitting part in the crime and has to figure out if it was justifiable homicide or straight murder. The case proceeds to elude to California's booming oil industry as well as his own past after he stumbles upon a wire recording during the investigation that mentions the daughter of Faye Dunaway's illfated character in the last film.The Two Jakes to me can stand on its own with Chinatown. Polanski directed the first film much much differently than Nicholson addresses this followup. I don't believe in the case of Chinatown a sequel needs to be a comparable continuation. Making a second installment sixteen years later allows a lot of license for it to be its own beast. Some such sequels done that way are disasters. The Two Jakes stays afloat. And Madeleine Stowe remains the most insatiably attractive woman of any superlative comment that I've made within the past month at least. And I've made a lot.The film's theatrical trailer is actually incredible. It's narrated by Gittes telling us how the war was good for Los Angeles in so many different ways that contribute to his business as extremely dry bits of humor throughout the film punctuate it here and there and provocative often voyeuristic shots from the movie are included.";

	schema:reviewBody "This sounded pretty good... Nicholson is mostly fun to watch and I enjoyed Chinatown immenselyTowne returning to write this sequel was a treat as well. I enjoyed it for a while but not too far past the halfway point I realized that it had run out of steam... the film kept rolling but it no longer kept the viewers' attention. Jack Nicholson is no director and it shows... while he is a skilled actor he should stay in front of the camera instead of trying his hand behind it. The cinematography is close but doesn't quite make it to being good... we have shots that linger and wasted opportunities aplenty. Polanski's loose involving camera is sorely missed here. The pacing is also off... the film ends up seeming heavy as a result. The writing is quite good. The acting varies but is mostly on the positive end. The tone isn't entirely sure what it wants to be but does create some great noir moments. Jake's monologues are occasionally spoton. The mystery varied some... parts of it I had figured out before the lead whereas others only became clear to me just as they were revealed. This is a hit and miss scenario... and unfortunately it misses more than it hits. This is worth watching as a continuation of Chinatown for those that want more of the plot and can compromise with the drop in style and finesse of the filmmaking values. I recommend this to big fans of Jack Nicholson and those interested in seeing what occurred after the events of Chinatown. 610".

	schema:reviewBody "In The Two Jakes just as in Chinatown private investigator Jake Gittes Jack Nicholson finds himself in a tight spot after having been misled by one of his clients. The deception in Chinatown related to a client's identity whereas in this case it's hidden motives that lead to big problems for Jake. The subsequent investigations in both movies soon mushroom into something far larger than originally anticipated and eventually uncover serious corruption involving California's valuable resources.The similarities between the two plots are not untypical of what's normally seen where a successful movie is followed by a sequel but in order to establish its own value convincingly a sequel needs to provide something different or better than the original. In this case something different is attempted as due to the passage of time since the original film Jake has evolved significantly as a character and his preoccupation with past events fills him with sadness and regret as well as a profound sense of loss.The events in The Two Jakes take place in Los Angeles in 1948. Eleven years have elapsed since Evelyn Mulwray was shot in Chinatown and Jake is now considerably more prosperous. His business has expanded and been relocated to an impressive new building and despite the often sleazy nature of his work he's gained a certain degree of respectability as well as some extra weight.A property developer who's convinced that his wife is having an affair approaches Jake with what appears to be a routine job to gather evidence against her. Jake supplies the recording equipment and cameras to record what transpires when he and his client Jake Berman Harvey Keitel go to the motel where Mrs Berman Meg Tilly is expected to be with her lover.On the night when their plan is put into action Berman breaks into the motel room and on finding his wife with another man simply shoots him dead. Jake is shocked to discover that the dead man is Berman's business partner and his wife Lillian Bodine Madeleine Stowe thinks that what transpired was a planned murder. Furthermore Lillian's attorney Chuck Newty Frederic Forrest tells Jake that it appears that he was an accessory to murder and that unless he can prove that Berman planned to kill his partner he will see to it that Jake is sued and financially ruined in the process.Mysteriously the recording made at the motel included a couple of mentions of Katherine Mulwray's name and Jake decides to find out their significance as well as pursuing his investigation into what lay behind the killing of Mark Bodine John Hackett. He discovers that Berman and Bodine were involved in selling houses in a subdivision of the San Fernando Valley and that in the event of Bodine's death Berman and his wife would inherit the whole business. As it seemed possible that there may be oil deposits on the land the business could in fact be more valuable than first realised and in that case whoever held the mineral rights could potentially become very rich. Jake pursues the various strands of his investigation with limited success until he eventually finds the answers to all his questions from someone who like him is haunted by the past.An important prerequisite for fully understanding and enjoying The Two Jakes is an ability to recall the complicated plot of Chinatown and the names of its various characters. As this sequel was released 16 years after the original film it's obvious that a high proportion of cinemagoers at that time would not have been able to appreciate it sufficiently to enjoy it themselves or to recommend it to their friends and consequently it's also not surprising that it wasn't a box office success.In a very empathetic performance which is both measured and subtle Jack Nicholson conveys just how jaded world weary and cynical Jake has become since his experiences in Chinatown and also how deeply he's haunted by the past. The remainder of the cast also contribute strong performances with Keitel Stowe and Tilly being particularly good.The Two Jakes falls short of the brilliance of its classic predecessor but there's still much to commend it. Its story of adultery greed blackmail and murder is intriguing throughout and extremely well written. The inclusion of Peggy Lee's song Don't Smoke In Bed some eyecatching art deco surroundings and Vilmos Zsigmond's stunning cinematography also contribute immensely to the wonderful atmosphere of the piece which seems to evoke late1940s L.A. so convincingly. The only caveat however is to make sure to see Chinatown before watching this movie.".

Robert Towne's screenplay is smart but Nicholson's direction lacks the creativity and overall brilliance of Roman Polanski's.  Meg Tilly is adequate in the film.

Before the war the valley was largely orange and walnut groves and before the big boom the government built many Defense plants here to build and develop most of it's planes. To accommodate the many employees of these plants housing developers moved in and there were many power grabs of which these 2 movies revolve around. After the infusion of the water that was brought in via the Mullholland Dam Project part of the plot of Chinatown the population of the Valley grew in leaps and bounds! What was a pleasant drive in the country as Los Angeleans referred to the SFV as before the late 40's became the largest housing boom the country has ever seen before or since! Currently there are at least 3 million people living heremany undocumented immigrants live here uncounted. Anyone who owned land became wealthy including the late Bob Hope who owned vast amounts of Valley acreage! Many of the farmers from back then  like Van Owen and Van nuys sold thier land and became very rich. I think that the John Huston character from Chinatown was based on one of the Van characters. They even named major avenues in the Valley after Van Nuys and Van Owen. I think that the actual filming of the movie was shot north of the San Fernando Valley because it is all developed now. I am too young to remember the era of this movie but i can appreciate since I live in LA and can see many of the buildings seen in the Hollywood and downtown scenes that still stand and look just like they did then! I loved this movie for the many ways it captured the era. One scene where Jake is driving you can hear on the radio the serial The Whistler which is still played among others on the Oldtime Radio Hour on a local AM station 1070.  True this town isn't as old or historical as a Boston or New York or Philadelphia but it has had it's moments and it's moods are reflected well in this movie. If you don't at first understand the plot maybe it isn't as complex as it may seem. It's about a part of our country that exploded with growth and opportunities perhaps like none other and of course there will be visionary people trying to capitalize on that and make a fortune.".

If you don't at first understand the plot maybe it isn't as complex as it may seem. It's about a part of our country that exploded with growth and opportunities perhaps like none other and of course there will be visionary people trying to capitalize on that and make a fortune.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Two Jakes is probably the most perfect example of why no one should ever make a sequel to a masterpiece 16 years later Godfather III anyone?. It's very easy to say that it suffers unfairly in comparison to the masterpiece that was Chinatown  that one should take it on its own terms. Fair enough but to anyone who hasn't seen Chinatown the plot of The Two Jakes is completely  utterly incomprehensible as opposed to extremely confusing to those who have. The film can only be understood as an addition to the story that began in Chinatown  as such can't avoid savage comparisons when placed alongside such a vastly superior film.It picks up the story of Jake Gittes ten years or so after the events of Chinatown. He finds himself embroiled in another seemingly straightforward infidelity case gone wrong which leads to corruption  treachery in the highest corridors of power this time over oil rather than water. The twist such as it is involves Katherine Mulwray the incestuous offspring of Evelyn Mulwray  her father the vile Noah Cross the heroine  villain from Chinatown.Sounds good but this interesting idea is buried within a labyrinthine mess of a plot that jumps all over the place with real estate scams terminal diseases petty hoodlums earthquakes gay bars  most irritating of all Jake's overdemanding fianc.What buries the film is the fact that it doesn't ever really know what sort of film it actually wants to be. Chinatown was a twisted detective story that got darker  darker every minute  left the viewer in a world where evil triumphed nothing was certain  no one could be trusted. The Two Jakes however is constantly veering between Jake's depressing musings over the past screwball sex comedy with Madeleine Stowe's loopy widow vague hints at conspiracy theories over who really runs Los Angeles  a general air of cuteness around the character of Jake Gittes. Rather than being regarded by his peers as the disruptive  sleazy bedroom peeper that he is he tends to be popular among just about everyone cop  criminal alike. You can just hear them saying Oh that Jake he's such a character tsk tsk...There's no terrifying villain to even approach the demon that John Huston created with Noah Cross  no real villain at all come to think of it. Harvey Keitel's Jake Berman is the architect behind the whole scam but ends up as some sort of herovictim who was acting with good intentions all along despite shooting a man in cold blood Mickey Nice Ruben Blades is more like a cartoon character waving weapons around  never using them  Earl Rawley Richard Farnsworth is never exactly made out to be doing anything REALLY immoral or illegal despite being the man who seems to be in charge of absolutely everything i.e. the successor to Noah Cross.The great twist regarding the identity of Katherine Mulwray is the final nail in the coffin. Given Jake's obsession over the past  over her in particular it's not convincing at all that he wouldn't have recognised her immediately even though he meets her 'alterego' several times before finally realising her true identity in one of the most poorly executed revelation scenes I've ever seen. You're left thinking Um so who's she really meant to be? Oh that's right Katherine Mulwray  but wouldn't he have known anyway er are you sure she's Katherine Mulwray he didn't actually say maybe she's someone else...For the psychotic Chinatown fan  yes I do count myself as one there's plenty of cameos  references  Joe Mantell as Jake's offsider Walsh Perry Lopez as a handicapped Lou Escobar James Hong as Kahn Evelyn Mulwray's butler the snotty clerk in the hall of records makes an appearance the same orange groves are used as a location complete with the exact same 'No Trespassing' sign  it just happens to be lying around old photos  newsclippings are used ad nauseam despite the fact that they're stills from Chinatown that couldn't possibly have been taken as photos  even Faye Dunaway pops up in a brief voiceover.Plenty of things to remind the fans what it's a sequel to  there are some wonderfully haunting echoes of the past that constantly torments Jake Gittes but ultimately The Two Jakes is just a big disappointing mess. Loads of talent no direction.Chinatown's writer  creator Robert Towne had originally envisioned a trilogy of J.J. Gittes films chronicling the history of Los Angeles one set in the 1930's about water one in the 1940's about oil  another in the 1950's about the freeway system apparently to be called 'Cloverleaf' after a type of freeway exit configuration. He along with Robert Evans  Jack Nicholson set up a company in the 1980's called TEN Towne Evans Nicholson to continue the endeavour  Towne was slated to direct The Two Jakes but he walked away long before the production actually started. The one reason that's most often cited was his objection to the original casting of producer Robert Evans as Jake Berman.

Someone gets shot and the case unpeels more layers of a larger issue involving money and land and more people.

	schema:reviewBody "I really wanted this film to work better than it did. Jack Nicholson's Jake Gittes character from Chinatown deserved a better sequel than this however. That said Nicholson is still a treat to watch as the resourceful private eye and he even shows some skill behind the camera. The cinematography by Vilmos Zsigmond is as wonderful as ever. Problems come mostly from the fact that Robert Towne's script can't let go of too many elements from the original film and we the audience are left with one of those could have been great films.The story picks up about a decade or so after the events in Chinatown. WWII is now over and Jake Gittes has become a much more successful investigator yet he still does the occasional adultery case. In the opening scenes of The Two Jakes Gittes gets himself involved in one such case with deadly consequences. A man we are led to believe is a jealous husband Keitel hires Gittes to stake out a motel with him where his wife Tilly will be meeting her lover. The lover turns out to be Keitel's business partner and Keitel shoots the man dead! This leaves Gittes as a possible accessory to murder! It's up to Gittes to clear his name and figure out if Keitel's fit of anger was just that or if there are bigger things going on in the background. Well of course there are! This is a Robert Towne script! Before we're done we've got the housing industry the oil industry and a sexcrazed widow in the mix as the story wildly jumps the tracks and eventually leads to an explosive conclusion.That plot I have just described actually would have been enough for a great new film about Jake Gittes. Trouble is Towne makes the mistake of digging up elements from Chinatown that seem awfully contrived as they are woven into the current plot. We learn early on for example that Gittes is still haunted by the memory of Faye Dunaway's character from Chinatown. Too much time is wasted digging up memories of her even at one point having Gittes find her old butler and rehash old memories with him. In the last fifteen minutes we also learn that Keitel's wife is really Dunaway's daughter from Chinatown. Yes the one she had in an incestuous relationship with her father. This is just too much of a contrivance to swallow. There is simply no need to bring the Mulwray family back and try to weave them into this story! There are other problems with the story. We are told that Gittes in engaged but we never really get to know his fianc and she is all but forgotten until a scene where she ends the whole affair with him. Richard Farnsworth is introduced as an unscrupulous oil man who may be doing great damage to the countryside with his illegal drilling practices. Yet once this is revealed to us nothing ever comes of it! I think the film probably suffered from too many rewrites. Trouble with Towne is he knows he's a gifted writer. So he likely feels he needs to make things needlessly complicated in order to put his name on a script.This film bombed badly in the theaters. this is probably due to the long production delays as much as anything. Too many people probably forgot how good Chinatown was to want to go see this film. It's too bad that The Two Jakes keeps trying to remind us.6 of 10 stars.The Hound.".

This is just too much of a contrivance to swallow. There is simply no need to bring the Mulwray family back and try to weave them into this story! There are other problems with the story. We are told that Gittes in engaged but we never really get to know his fianc and she is all but forgotten until a scene where she ends the whole affair with him. Richard Farnsworth is introduced as an unscrupulous oil man who may be doing great damage to the countryside with his illegal drilling practices. Yet once this is revealed to us nothing ever comes of it! I think the film probably suffered from too many rewrites. Trouble with Towne is he knows he's a gifted writer. So he likely feels he needs to make things needlessly complicated in order to put his name on a script.This film bombed badly in the theaters. this is probably due to the long production delays as much as anything. Too many people probably forgot how good Chinatown was to want to go see this film. It's too bad that The Two Jakes keeps trying to remind us.6 of 10 stars.The Hound.";

	schema:reviewBody "Unquestionably inferior to its predecessor and shockingly mediocre the Jack Nicholson directed The Two Jakes is the sequel to Roman Polanski's nearperfect film noir Chinatown. With several familiar characters and a storyline that eventually ties into some of the twisted events of the first film The Two Jakes still manages to be horribly bland and excruciatingly boring. Originally a third chapter to the Gittes story was intended but The Two Jakes was so overwhelmingly disappointing that the franchise was stopped dead in its tracks.It's fifteen years since the events of Chinatown and Jake Gittes Jack Nicholson is still haunted by his encounter with Evelyn Mulwray Faye Dunaway. Jake Berman Harvey Keitel hires Gittes to protect him after he shoots his wife's lover during a recording of evidence being conducted by Gittes in the adjacent room. More suspicious perhaps wiser and definitely fatter Gittes struggles to get to the heart of the murder which leads him headlong into a torrid affair with Lillian Bodine Madeleine Stowe the wife of the murdered man. During his investigation the bitterer private eye runs into a plot to obtain mineral rights from property that might be rich in oil and a trail of deceit that could reunite him with Katherine Mulwray Evelyn's daughter.Also written by Robert Towne The Two Jakes has lost just about every aspect that made Chinatown sensational. It ultimately no longer resembles film noir. A courtroom drama blended with a complex murder mystery this halfhearted followup leaves much to be desired in almost every department. Jake's office has grown bigger and he now owns the entire building. But the adulterous scum twotimers doubledealers and lowlifes still frequent his profession and show no signs of slowing down as he immediately picks up another equally dirty case. This time however Gittes appears to fearlessly interfere with evidence and police matters beyond the extent that he did in Chinatown. He is a much less likable character and all of his smarmy smartmouthed smoothtalking sarcasm has been replaced with sour vindictiveness.The story is just as intricate as Chinatown but the characters are so quickly and poorly developed that we don't care about them and quickly discontinue bothering with figuring out who's who and what's what. This murder mystery is so drawn out and lengthy that we actually don't attempt to solve the crimes before Gittes does. Striking deals with criminals and fistfighting cops Gittes has become an antihero we can't easily root for Stowe is a frenzied nearly psychotic widow and Keitel is shrouded by mystery all the way through. As uninvolving as the story is its complexity only serves to annoy the viewer who halfway through the film has given up trying to sort out the overabundance of characters and events that don't make much sense and don't amount to anything significant.The Two Jakes adopts a monotone narration by Nicholson which was thankfully absent from Chinatown. Lou Escobar Perry Lopez returns as does Kahn the butler James Hong but it couldn't feel less like the fulfilling and disturbing noir Polanski flawlessly crafted 16 years earlier. With flashbacks and unnecessary reused lines of dialogue including I wouldn't extort my worst enemy  that's where I draw the line this snailpaced convoluted excuse for both storytelling and filmmaking is a pathetic way for the revered Jake Gittes to fade away.Mike Massie".

This movie connects the original and is called  The Two Jakes.  In this follow up story which dealt with water rights and was filled with a twisted and scandalous family is back with an even more confusing signature of who wants what and where. Jack Nicholson not only directs but also stars as J.J. 'Jake' Gittes the introspective but sophisticated Private Eye. Harvey Keitel plays Julius 'Jake' Berman the rich and futuristic housing developer who has several schemes with which to grow wealthier but to secure his wife's future. Eli Wallach plays Cotton Weinberger the high price attorney. Rubn Blades plays Michael 'Mickey Nice' Weisskopf who is out to solve problems despite whom it may hurt.Perry Lopez returns as Captain Lou Escobar with David Keith as an ambitious Dectective out to nail Gittes. Richard Farnsworth Earl Rawley Tracey Walter and James Hong add to the list of great stars in the movie. Though the story is as deep as a fifties novel if one pays close attention the outcome is inevitable. Seen is this retrospective and the modern problems arrayed in the future this dramatic movie should lay the foundation for the third in the series. All in all the movie should be listed as second in a trio of Classic movies for Nicholson. Recommended for anyone who loved the oldies movies with the hard bitten Private eye spinning a tale. ".

It's not as good as Chinatown few films are but Nicholson is right back in stride as the laconic Philip Marlowe like private eye from the Raymond Chandler era of fictional detectives.In fact repeating their roles from Chinatown besides Nicholson are James Hong Joe Mantell and Perry Lopez. And the plot is a continuation in many ways of Chinatown and the case that we knew would haunt Nicholson the rest of his days.It's now post World War II in Los Angeles and Nicholson has been retained by real estate mogul Harvey Keitel whose first name is also Jake in a divorce matter. He's hoping to catch wife Meg Tilly en flagrato with his partner whom he's been thinking has been two timing him with his wife. Nicholson keeping up with the times as a good gumshoe has now the latest recording device and he's got the trysting place bugged with he and Keitel in the next room.But when at one point Keitel produces a revolver and bursts into the two of them and shoots the partner it looks at first like a case of Keitel acting on the unwritten law. But appearances are quite deceiving as deceiving as they were in Chinatown. And a lot of people want that recording of the event Nicholson most of all because it has a mention of the child of Faye Dunaway from back in the case he Nicholson was involved with in Chinatown.The rest of the film is Nicholson stalling everybody while he tries to find out just what all this is about. Along the way he meets criminal attorney for Keitel Eli Wallach a Mickey Cohen like mobster in Ruben Blades and the widow of Keitel's partner Madeline Stowe who is ready and willing to make Nicholson an offer he will find it hard to refuse.Nicholson directed himself in this version taking over for Roman Polanski whom as we know was in exile from the USA back then. He knew his character well and smoothly continued the saga of J.J. Gittes. The atmosphere of the Forties Los Angeles is well done. It's mentioned that a third Gittes film was planned. Hopefully those plans are not scrapped and we'll get to see Nicholson once again in one of my favorite roles of his.".

This is the only one of three films that I saw that were directed by Jack Nicholson himself and I really wonder how much help he got. Some cinematography is dazzlingly beautiful but did he really  for instance  find that exact location the one with the wooden poles at the Californian coastline where Rawley and Gittes have their conversation by himself? Maybe that's not what directing is all about and I'm a bit of a laymen in that respect but isn't directing also about keeping an eye on the development of the story and coaching your actors? The story is not uninteresting but it's a somewhat uninspired carboncopy of its predecessor with rather mediocre acting and I guessed straight away that the 'mystery lady' was indeed Miss Mulwray... And that soundtrack could have been toned a bit couldn't it?Then there are some really odd scenes seemingly thrown in for the 'good measure' of simply trying something different like the sex scene with Stowe and the 'suck my gun' scene with Keith. They culd have worked but they felt way out of tune here.I can't say that 'The two Jakes' is a bad film it is much too easy on the eyes and the story and acting are entertaining enough but  unsurprisingly  it has almost none of the magic of its predecessor 'Chinatown'. The cinematography is pretty much impeccable the story was worked out pretty well and the overall atmosphere was more than doable but that's about it. By the way did anyone notice Jack rambling on an on he could talk the balls off a... while that one tune set in that same tune that the Coen brothers used in the film noir parody 'The big Lebowski'? Another fun bit was when Jake broke into a house when an oldtime commercial was on. I hope it was an original but I really don't know.Well entertaining for sure but also quite bleak compared to the original. 6 to 7 out of 10.".
