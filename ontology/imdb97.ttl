Obviously the movie is ripped from a VHS source with the highly bleeding reds and hue saturation that would make a drag queen toss out his makeup bag.The audio is pretty lofi except for the odd instances where glass breaks and it magically turns into a lifelike experience.Brandon Lee reminds me of a young Bruce Campbell in this movie believe it or not. Lots of corny dialogue and oneliners throughout. He gets beat up and shot at and actually takes a few of the hits once in a while. There's TONS of continuity errors with the editing.The accents are hilarious as well as the spoken and written Spanish that was so poor I thought that I might have written it. Since I don't remember the movie actually saying they were in Cuba it's funny to just imagine some fictional land of VW vans with unlimited fuel supplies disappearing camels and 400 mile deserts that are very easy to navigate through as long as you find a horse after it ran away a day ago.The movie is actually somewhat fastpaced unlike most of the garbage that was intolerable even while inebriated that I've grabbed up from the 1 bins.Next time you run by it pick yourself up a copy then pour out some of your 40 in memory of the late great Brandon Lee.".

Bad News it appears the Russians are on some kind of LAZER MISSIONOk so the Russians are on a Laser Mission... for a huge diamond and Ernest Borgnine... in Cuba.... which doesn't have a desert but still manages to appear as part of the scenery. This film has more than you could ever ask for ALL STAR CAST quality stock footage crazy dialogue a budget of 32 and a case of Schlitz beer. I can't say enough despite that of how great this movie was to watch. This movie is so bad that lines from this film have actually entered my daily vernacular!

After their rendezvous on the beach both Brandon and Borgnine are captured. This sets up the daring escape by Brandon after which he volunteers to go back and find the professor.This movie is classically bad. It seems to take place in Africa with Soviet Cuban and German soldiers involved. Debi Monahan rounds up the cast as the professor's daughter. She is thoroughly annoying in this role as her voice seems to increase in pitch as she gets louder and is also very whiny. The only redeeming qualities of her character is her push up blue dress which seems to be the only thing she wears during the movie she does wear a white jump suit at the beginning and a bed sheet after the sex scene.Brandon Lee is suppose to be the star of this movie however he comes off quite flat. Its not just the acting thats bad but also the action. I haven't seen so many dropkicks since Star Trek  The Original Series. He also tries to emulate his father by doing characterizations see Chinese Connection. The slapping Manuel sketch is a good indicator how bad his acting is. It is funny though. He also seems to pull off an Arab beggar.To complement Brandon other than Debi Monahan we get Mr. Borgnine whom we see actually sleeping during a scene a crazy Soviet Colonel who refuses to die a white big game hunter and a pair of bungling Cuban soldiers a female Sergeant and the beloved Manuel.Nothing sums up this movie more completely than the theme song of the movie Mercenary Man which seems to be playing in either muzak form or the 80's bad rock form and the dialog.Dialog such as  Brandon I did my job. Pay me and let me get the hell outta here.CIA suit Kiss ... my ... ass !!! Brandon NO !This movie was definitely worth the 4 I spent on it. RIP Brandon.Celluloid Rehab".

	schema:reviewBody "This is an awesome low budget Action Film that does not deserve the 2.510 rating it gets on this site!. All the characters were really cool and the film is action packed and it also had a really cool story to it as well. There are a lot of action films that are much much worse that this that deserve to get this rating in my opinion and hey it helps if you got Brandon Lee as the main star!. it had a lot of cool fight scenes and the prison escape was exciting however there was one moment that i found a bit too corny  and that's when the main villain Col. Kalishnakov survives 3 or 4 gunshot woundsand being hit by an explosion until they finally kill him. This is an awesome action film extremely low budget but i enjoyed it very very muchsure it has lots of flaws but it's tons of fun and i feel it's a great film. The Direction is very good . BJ Davis does a very good job here with stylish action scenes some cool shots doing awesome with the low budget he had and he kept the film at a very fast pace!. There is some blood. we get quite a few bloody gunshot woundsknife in the chestslit throatsevered heads and a gory impaling. The Acting is surprisingly very good. Brandon Lee Was AMAZING as he always was he is extremely likableexcellent in the acting department hilarioushad great chemistry with Debi A. Monahan kicked that ass and was tons of fun to watch he also had some great one liners!Brandon Ruled!. Debi A. Monahan is GORGEOUS! and does very well here a little annoying at first but she quickly grew one me and became very likable i also enjoyed the chemistry between her and Lee great job! where is she now?. Ernest Borgnine is good as the Prof and added class to this. Graham Clarke is excellent as the main villain and was very menacing he was an interesting character. Pierre Knoessen and Maureen Lahoud are okay as the comic relief. Overall don't believe the 2.5 rating it got on here i say it's a must see!  out of 5".

	schema:headline " At least it only cost 1!";
	schema:reviewBody "While roaming the dollar DVD bin recently I picked out this 1990 action movie that stars the late Brandon Lee Bruce Lee's son. The only movie from Brandon that I had previously seen is probably the only movie of his that you've seen 1994's The Crow which made him a star but cost him his life. He was shot to death during filming of that movie by an improperly loaded gun. I knew that he had done a few minor movies before that but had never seen any.I'm not endorsing Laser Mission. From the opening credits I could tell that it was very cheaply done. And at least on this DVD the audio is about a full second behind the visual! The movie is about a maverick government agent named Michael Gold played by Lee who goes on a mission to save a scientist named Braun Ernest Borgnine who is being forced by the Soviets to build a nuclear weapon combining a laser with a huge diamond. Great stuff! Brandon's acting is okay as is Borgnine's. I like Brandon's sarcastic wit. But much of the rest of the acting is pretty amateur especially that of his character's love interest Alissa Debi Monahan who might pass for a decent porno actress.The action scenes aren't bad for a low budget movie but the script is weak and loaded with '80s action movie clichs. And it's especially humorous to see Alissa  who looks and acts like a typical blonde air headed bimbo  joining Michael in blowing away dozens of bad guys! She also does some pretty impressive driving  in a peace wagon no less  while Michael blows away still more bad guys from the back seat!But there are two things that make the movie worth the dollar for me. One is that parts of it are so bad that they're hilarious including one time when Brandon and a guy who he's fighting both fall off of a building about 30 feet high and Brandon lands just gets up and walks away! The other guy wasn't so lucky falling on the spikes of a fence and dying.And the other thing I love about the movie is the music done by none other than David Knopfler of Dire Straits. He has one straight ahead rocker that is played during the opening credits closing credits and several times in between. I guess they were either on a tight budget so they could afford little music or they really loved that song! I think it's played six times during the movie!I'm pretty sure that's the only vocal song in the movie. The instrumental stuff is great too. I detect a little Pink Floyd influence in David's music.One other note of unintentional humor from Laser Mission in the movie Brandon's character wants the mission so bad that he's not doing it for the money. Yet the aforementioned song that's featured over and over is titled Mercenary Man! 310".

	schema:reviewBody "Laser Mission in and of itself has everything required of a Bmovie bad acting a plot of small significance and that overall feeling that this movie should have ended an hour ago. Perhaps the most hysterical part of the movie is its lack of a distinct location. The movie itself claims all the happenings are in Cuba. When Michael Gold arrives at the customs window he even cracks a joke saying Where can I get a good Cuban cigar? However later in the movie when Alyssa and Gold are driving the hippie van after their big chase scene Gold speaks of driving to a border. Cuba... is an ISLAND. Islands don't border anything. Secondly I don't recall Alyssa and Gold in a plane ever so how would they get to Africa to drive into Namibia? Add to that all the KGB running around trying to thwart Gold and the absurdly Germansounding Eckhardt and you start to really get lost wondering where these people are and what they are doing there. Also the sign that says Murto ou vivo in the hotel is Portuguese.As far as the acting I love some parts like the Cuban camp Gold parachutes into with Manuel and Roberta. Their accents resemble that of people doing Spanish movies for their classes on YouTube. I also like them in the chase scene Manuel Sergeant? You are no sergeant! You are a woman! Roberta Loco! I have ALWAYS been a woman! It also cracks me up when Alyssa is driving the hippie van in the chase scene and she is making faces and driving like she's driving a Maserati one of those My car and I ARE gorgeous looks.Anyway the video is definitely worth the 50 cents you pay for it... at least for me it was because it was a doublefeature 1 DVD with another trainwreck...

Well you knew nothing bad was going to happen to him when Kalishnakov inexplicably removes the handcuffs and allows himself to be overpowered.A couple people speculated that the film's fictional setting was Cuba. I believe it opened in some madeup subSaharan nation  I'm not going back to look up the name  but it was stated during one of the briefings that the bad guys were on their way to Namibia a real desert country in southwest Africa. I only make note of it because I traveled there a couple years ago and I swear I recognized one of the street scenes they used as well as the distinctive color of the Namib desert sand. It makes me wonder if they blew most of the filming budget on a boondoggle to Africa for a few location shots.".

	schema:headline " In memory of Brandon Lee 19651993";
	schema:reviewBody "Today he would be 50 if still alive. Take this review as a tribute to the legacy of Brandon Lee. Lee plays as Michael Gold who is mercenary and on a mission in Cuba he talks with professor on beach and then bad guys shoot sleeping dart to Gold and same kind of dart to professor as well. When Gold wakes up hes in prison cell and he is about to be executed. Dumb guards let Gold escape and that scene was really impressive Gold alone kills 30 guys and escapes to United States. In States Gold is furious because his boss didn't tell what kind of mission it was. But still Gold agrees to save professor and his daughter. As a fake outfit Gold once again goes to Cuba and he meets Alissa who pretends to be professors daughter but in the very end of this movie shes not. I remember car chasing scene involving Gold and Alissa and Alissa is driving and she drives like mad girl. Meanwhile Gold is shooting bad guys. It was some kind of mini van full of ammunition. Next scene I remember was in desert and Gold and Alissa are walking there and still 1 bad guy notices them and Gold goes under sand and surprises bad guy and they have small fight involving Alissa as well. Other sand scene was in destroyed building there was guy with crossbow and he nearly hits Gold or Alissa duo quickly shoots guy but he jumps off pillar and goes back tries to use knife but duo shoots him pretty fast. The final scene was professor being kidnapped and Alissa being tied up as well so its Michael Gold for rescue. He first saves professor and professor knows where mines are Alissa was prisoner in mines so final fight scene takes place in mines. Leader of mines kiss Alissa and when he hears gun shooting he joins them and manages to shoot Gold in back. Then Gold goes to hole and leader goes there as well with Alissa. Gold shoots leader but he had bullet proof vest so in ending leader goes again and nearly shoots our heroes but tunnels explodes and so does our leader. You thought leader was still dead? No he is still alive but this time Gold drives and hits leader who also hits brick wall and doesn't move after that. Movie ends. I was surprised how good this movie was.".

The German bad guy here is Werner Pocath who somehow must have got lost trying to find the latest Italian production and ended up in this film instead. Brandon puts us through our paces by doing impressions of beggars and military officers before hooking up with Borgnine's lowcut dress wearing daughter and tearing off looking for Borgnine who can somehow use lasers and diamonds to make nuclear weapons all done to the tune 'mercanary man by David Knopfler over and over again.To hell with the plot. You've got many impossible gunfights even Borgnine gets involved things blowing up real good terrible banter between our heroes lots of standing around laughing bad guys that won't die and other bad guy who do really stupid things like releasing Lee from handcuffs and getting immediately killed.You've also got a punch up filmed from underneath a horse's stomach editing that makes no sense especially a fist fight with Pocath where they randomly teleport onto a roof and the battle at the end while have you going how did they? and Why did he? to yourself or friends if you have any of those. There's even a spelling mistake at the end credits by the people who did the end credits in their own credit!This SCifi free film is part of Mill Creek's 50 Sci Fi Classics box set.

End of plot synopsis.This laughably and lovably inept movie is just out and out silly  so take that as a solid recommendation. One of our readers Gap suggested we review this movie and we always try to listen to our followers. Brandon Lee is charming as the CIA agentmercenary who is a master of disguise named Michael Gold. There is a 526carat diamond at stake called the Verbeek ? diamond which will enable whoever gets it to build a powerful laser to take over the world. Naturally many bad guys are after him as he tries to rescue Professor Braun Borgnine who has been kidnapped. His journey takes him from Cuba to the Namibian desert with Braun's daughter Alissa Monahan in tow.There are inane action sequences involving shooting blowups guard tower falls evil Germans fruit cart chases and many other clichs all done in what seems to be an unintentional cartoonish style. The help the daughter find the kidnapped father is a very American Ninjastyle plot and Ernest Borgnine's accent comes and goes. The unnamed song which repeats many times throughout the film plus all the nonsensical goofiness reminded us of White Fire. The song is musically very reminiscent of There's No Easy Way Out and the singer sounds drunk. Apparently it was done by David Knopfler and his husky amazingly slurred singing makes Bob Dylan seem like someone with perfect diction.Laser Mission was done in the golden year of 1989. It was directed by BJ Davis who has a long history in the stunt world. It has since fallen into the public domain and thus can be found in gas stations all over the world for about a dollar. If you see it we strongly suggest you pick it up as it is well worth that meager investment. Sure the quality is blurry even the SOUND is blurry but it will provide entertainment and laughs. And isn't that what movies are all about? Laser Mission is a silly great time. We'd love to find more movies like this.for more insanity please visit comeuppancereviews.com".

	schema:reviewBody "I've considered Brandon Lee to be one of my favourite actors for a while. Of course I'd never seen 'Laser Mission'. I may be a blind fan boy most of the time but even I can't accept 'Laser Mission' as a Brandon Lee movie. Then again I never intended to as it was my first foray into a pack of fifty classic scifi movie and obviously one of those movies that are amazingly and amusingly bad.'Laser Mission' would have made a whole lot more sense if it DIDN'T have a plot. Unfortunately there is a plot. A plot that lacks any coherence and some 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' style plot holes and continuity blunders.Brandon plays Michael Gold a freelance spy a mercenary perhaps? working for the CIA. Gold's mission is to get to Professor Braun Ernest Borginine I've been told he was a real actor sometime before appearing in this before the bad guys do. It seems Professor Braun has come up with plans for a doomsday device but not actually built it yet ensuring his status on the border between normal scientist and mad scientist. Prof. Braun is hiding out in a fictitious African country being chased by what are either German or Russian spies  headhunters and Cuban soldiers being the comic relief. In order to find Braun Gold must make contact with Braun's daughter an American veterinarian and KGB spy. That's all I understood. I stopped trying to make sense of things after a while. We all know plots are generally neglected in action movies right from the Hollywood blockbuster to the bmovie with a tiny budget. That doesn't mean that a plot has to be so mind bendingly stupid that all you can do is laugh. A simple revenge story will suffice not some crazy story that would probably be suited to a James Bond movie if it made a little sense. On the other hand judging by 'Die Another Die' it won't be long before 007 ends up in a 'Laser Mission' remake. In fact this does reminds me a lot of Jackie Chan's 'Armour of God 2 Operation Condor' both in story and location.I think director BJ Davis assumed that lots of explosions would make up for the lack of any quality fight scenes in the film. It sure looks that way but I'll give Davis credit It must have taken tremendous talent to get Brandon Lee to look absolutely terrible in a fight scene. Half of the fights consist of stunt men diving in Brandon's general direction and Brandon doing something to make it look he is actually fighting with the waves of diving stunt men. How symbolic is the fact that the best fight scene in the movie a very ordinary scene by normal standards is partially obscured by a horse's ass I thought they used camels in the desert and just where did that horse come from anyway?. Again all you can do is laugh. Or cringe. At least the car chase is almost exciting.As much as I hated 'Blind Vengeance' I have to admit that even 'Blind Vengeance' had better production values than this. However 'Blind Vengeance' didn't have any rock ballads. Rock ballads make anything better. In this case we have a rock ballad called 'Mercenary Man' that is played nearly nonstop throughout the whole movie. Apparently it was composed by none other than David Knopfler once the guitarist of Dire Straits. 'Laser Mission' is a terrible incredibly cheesy bgrade action movie. It'll either make you laugh or make you cringe. For what it's worth I laughed  210".

	schema:headline " The Return of the Intelligent Stalker Boyfriend Roach";
	schema:reviewBody "Series Note see main body of review.Elementary school teacher and noted author Remy Alix Koromzay has man problems. Unfortunately they're getting worse as the men she has problems with are ending up dead and she's the prime suspect. At the same time we see that at least one of the superbugs from Mimic 1997 has survived. Remy her wannabe boyfriends a couple students the police the superbugs and some XFilesish mysterious government types are on a collision course in this film.I usually try to write my reviews within 24 hours of watching a film at most. The fresher the film is in my mind the easier it is to record my feelings about it. I also have a tendency to forget films fairly quickly if I haven't seen them a few times. If I wait too long the review is not likely to make it even past the larval stage. Mimic 2 I watched a couple days ago already. The main reason that I'm bringing this up is that the more I think about it the more I can't remember why I didn't give it an even higher rating I jot my rating down immediately. It seems in retrospect that this film should have been at least a 9 for me. But usually my first judgment is right at least at the time and so an 8 it is on this viewing.Of course even an 8 is a lot higher than most folks are giving this film. A large part of the reason why is that Mimic 2 is completely different in tone than the first Mimic. Although Remy is a returning character she had a very minor role in the first film there's no reason that you need to watch the original before this one unless you just want more background on the superbugs.I suspect that the other reason why most folks are rating Mimic 2 much lower than I is because writer Joel Soisson and director Jean de Segonzac couldn't care one whit about making the film realistic. Mimic 2 is a campfest a cheesathon and a frequently absurdist celebration of filmic artificiality for its own sake. I happen to love those qualities. If you don't you'll likely hate this film.The embrace of artificiality is beautifully present in the production design and lighting. An early indicator is near the end of the opening sequence as species extinguisher Lincoln Trahm is making his way out of the subway system. He emerges onto a New York City street amidst glowing neon and other lighting in strong primary colors straight out of Dario Argento's Suspiria 1977. The film takes place primarily on two sets the outside surfaces of which are covered in attractively garish graffiti. The school set has an architectural style of retrodilapidated and there are unusual touches such as the desk nest which blocks the hall during later pivotal scenes.Much more bizarre and frequently funny are the characters plot and dialogue. Remy is a noted entomologist and author of at least a popular scientific account of insects yet she teaches elementary school. She is a serial onetimedater apparently with commitment aversions but she doesn't seem very choosy with her dates. Afterwards she takes Polaroid photographs of herself making grotesque faces mimics? and then writes the name of the dategonewrong beneath the image before adding them to her wall of shame. It a behavior that not unsurprisingly resembles a serial killer to Detective Klaski Bruno Campos.As for the superbug Soisson and Segonzac decided to take the human mimicry from the previous film more literally. In Mimic 2 the main bug is clearly sentient becoming just another psycho boyfriend for Remy. It's delightfully goofy although not without precedentto an extent it resembles the alien insect from InvaderLifeforce 1996.Delightfully goofy couldn't be more apt for this film overall. It seems as if Soisson and Segonzac couldn't take the premise quite seriously so in lieu of the intense highaction dingy glum of Mimic they went the tongueincheek route and gave us something not that far removed from say a later Frank Henenlotter film. Another angle which is probably the reason for the stressed artificiality is that it parallels the superbug's attempts which are far from perfect to mimic humankind. It's as if the sets the lighting the characters the plot and everything else is mimicking reality at the same time it's superficially mimicking the previous film.Segonzac still achieves an alienating gloom beneath all of the camp and the film is routinely suspensefulit's difficult to not be suspenseful when you're dealing with bugs. An important story point on that end is that Mimic has its share of smaller bugs toothe kind that can easily be behind your desk in the back of your shelves in your closet under your bed or right outside your door or window. The creature effects are all excellent. It's also wonderfully gory in some parts although it's mostly bug gore but that tends to have a higher ewww factor for me than human gore. Even more powerful there are some instances where the two types of gore are effectively mixed.While I'm sure I won't help resell the film to viewers who have already seen it and hated it hopefully I can help sway those on the fence and help guide those who don't know if they'd like to bother. It's important to develop a taste for camp and for the purposefully unrealistic and ridiculousit's a common approach from filmmakers. Films like Mimic 2 do not tend to have their odd differences because of incompetence. Rather there is usually an artistic reason for making particular decisions. That fact won't help you acquire the taste for these kinds of films but at least it can help you understand why they exist as they do.".

The story here is simpler not a bad thing in a horror flick as the plot stays on a straight course with good effect.  For those looking for bigtime special effects Mimic 2 might not satisfy.

Slashboombang! Predictable and stereotypical are key words for this movie. Anyone who can't see what's coming next must either be very naive or new to at least this genre. The actors just plow through the script not doing a bad job but I don't think they spent too much time on indepth characteranalysis. The only one who is a delight to see is the guy playing the leader of the bughuntingteamrecognize him but don't know his name.As for the ending don't worry I'm not gonna give this piece of art away  that was the final yank that flushed the movie down  it was as if they didn't have enough time money energy or whatever left and just fastforwarded the whole thing. It was full of logical glitches superpredictable and just mega sucking.To sum it up  I don't think too much effort was put into this movie or that anyone pondered upon what the end product would actually convey.

This helps the film because instead of focusing on the some of the obvious plot holes the viewer is sucked in to this rollercoaster ride of a movie.

Among those running with her are two of her students Nicky Will Estes and Sal Gaven E. Lucas and an NYC detective named Klaski Bruno Campos. What's more this particular creepy crawlie seems to have a real sexual interest in Remi.That's pretty much it for story in this moreofthesame sequel to Guillermo Del Toros' adaptation of the Donald A.

Some people will be pleased to note that the script contrives a way to get Koromzay out of her clothes. So Mimic 2 delivers fairly well on a sex and violence quotient. The cinematography is appropriately murky and a lot of the locations look pretty damn decrepit. There's not really much in the way of gore but there's a lot of slimy stuff. The visual effects are overall reasonably well done.Koromzay does alright in this leading role and the supporting cast likewise fares well enough. That includes Edward Albert Galaxy of Terror as an unnamed government operative who naturally wants things run a certain way. However the movie makes a shameful waste of character actor Jon Polito Miller's Crossing The Crow by giving him nothing interesting to do.Lovers of killer insect cinema may be able to do better than this but they could conceivably do worse. At least Mimic 2 has an excellent forward pace and a sufficient amount of action. Plus it only runs 82 minutes.Five out of 10.".

Plus it had Guillermo del Toro at the helm directing which injected some quality into the movie. It also had a nice horror setting the underground subway system.This movie has one major problem it doesn't know how to create any tension. It's build up is totally wrong. Things just happen in this movie and they happen way too quickly after each other. The movie always cuts right to the chase which is also the reason why the movie itself is only 82 minutes short. The build up also certainly isn't helped by its at time weak editing and stupid camera positioning.It's not like the concept of this movie is any less silly than that of the first movie but at least the first movie still somewhat worked out since it was a fine formulaic though fine crafted simple piece of horror.And no of course having the movie set inside of a school at night is something totally different than a dark subway system. It's not the same horror atmosphere. Otherwise the atmosphere within this movie is quite good. At least it does a decent job at recreating the same dark atmosphere as within the first movie.The acting is unfortunately also below par. Alix Koromzay is fine and she is also definitely helped by her looks but Bruno Campos is horrible as an extreme stereotyped New York cop. The movie also makes some odd choices with its characters. Having 2 kids walk around at the school trying to escape the mutated cockroaches just wasn't a great idea because you just know that they are not going to get killed off for the obvious reasons.The special effects and makeup effects on the other hand are real good. Especially when you consider that this is a straighttovideo flick. I remember that the first Mimic movie was quite fake looking in parts but I believe that also has to do with Guillermo del Toro's own unique style.All in all I just can't believe that they actually made a third movie after this. Oh well at least that one apparently has Lance Henriksen still in it.410httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Whelp two out of three ain't bad.Yes it may be shocking to some but after the delightfully underrated gem that is Guillermo del Toro's original 90's creaturefeature Mimic I also very much enjoyed the third entry in the series quite a bit. Mimic 3 Sentinel was an early feature from director J.T. Petty a filmmaker who is always at least consistently interesting even when his work has it's ups and downs. Mimic 3 was the little movie that could a directtovideo feature that fought an uphill battle against a cripplingly low budget and somehow came out moreorless solid and enjoyable with a fascinating take on the series that combined the original's ooeygooey monsters with a plot very much akin to Hitchcock's classic Read Window.But before that fascinating little third entry in the series there was one other... this flick Mimic 2. Brought to us with a script courtesy Joel Soisson and direction via Jean de Segonzac this 2001 release has quite a bit to live up to thanks to the two other entries in the series. And just how does it hold up? Does it compare to the grandiose and almost operatic nature of the original? Does it fill itself to burst with slowbuild intrigue and mystery like the misunderstood third film?Well unfortunately the answers are no and no.Mimic 2 is one of those weird instances where so much seems to going so well yet it never comes together to form a singular cohesive experience. It's stylish but vapid. Tightly paced but confusing. Methodically plotted but disjointed. Everything presented to the audience is almost paradoxical within the confines of its 80ish minute runtime. A series of jigsaw pieces that never quite come together leaving you with only portions of the finished product.Alix Koromzay stars as our lead Remi allegedly a returning character from the original but evidently she didn't make much of an impression because she's the only character I can't seem to recall an entomologist with a bit of a problem on her hands in the form of a stalker... a stalker that also happens to be one of the Judas Breed! Now she must try and save herself from this creature before it well... mates with her.To get it out of the way I have to address the cast who I feel are a big stepdown from the original. I hate to be so mean but Koromzay is a chore of a protagonist who is so bizarrely overthe top and eccentric you really can't identify or even sympathize with her. She's so bogged down with constant onthenose attempts at injecting delightful quirks Koromzay at times seems like she's literally losing her mind onscreen. Bruno Campos falls flat as a detective who is essentially every cool guy clich balled up into one person. He looks far too young for the sort of character he's meant to be portraying and his constant snazzy smooth delivery of dialog is grating. The only actors who emerge relatively unscathed are Edward Albert and Jon Polito in smaller supporting roles and I can't help but wonder if this is because they actually give realistic performances or because they are classy actors who already have a degree of builtin good will from the audience?Jean de Segonzac's visual direction is competent and even wickedly stylish at first but it quickly unravels as it reveals itself to be nothing more than a pretty crutch to cover for the subpar storytelling. Segonzac takes every opportunity to swoop spin tilt angle and fly the camera about seemingly in an attempt to build off of Guillermo del Toro's slick camerawork in the original but it all feels a bit pointless. It feels too manufactured and false. Like a music video gone tragically out of control. It also doesn't help that editor Kirk M. Morri seems to have gone a bit nuts in the editing room with the camera cutting constantly and scenes having little to no flow in between them. It's all so jarring and it feels like the film is giving you whiplash with the majority of scenes lasting maybe 30 seconds at most before it hastily cuts to the next one. It all just makes for an awkwardly confusing jumble of images that has little meaning.Writer Joel Soisson is a veteran of the cheesy directtovideo sequel market having worked on everything from Hollow Man 2 to Hellraiser 8 to The Prophecy 5. And that clearly shows here as the script is very much in line with the worst of this strange little subgenre in the world of sequels. Like many of the poorer directtovideo features of its era the script is an interesting idea executed poorly... a slapdash attempt at cashing in on a franchise name by taking a highconcept idea that could make for a great followup in this case a sortof twisted take on a lovestory and a gory creaturefeature but only giving it the faintest of thought and development. All so it could be rushed onto store shelves in 2001 in time to capitalize on the booming sales on DVD's of the early 2000's. The script is a cynical effort from a cynical writer.Combine all that with inconsistent set design often generic and flat cinematography lowerquality visual effects work and a smaller sense of scope and scale and you have yourself yet another bad sequel destined to be forgotten and left in obscurity with 99 of the other bad directtovideo sequels of its time.Mimic 2 barely manages to climb it's way to a 3 out of 10. Do yourself a favor skip this one and check out the far more interesting third film instead.".

The only actors who emerge relatively unscathed are Edward Albert and Jon Polito in smaller supporting roles and I can't help but wonder if this is because they actually give realistic performances or because they are classy actors who already have a degree of builtin good will from the audience?Jean de Segonzac's visual direction is competent and even wickedly stylish at first but it quickly unravels as it reveals itself to be nothing more than a pretty crutch to cover for the subpar storytelling. Segonzac takes every opportunity to swoop spin tilt angle and fly the camera about seemingly in an attempt to build off of Guillermo del Toro's slick camerawork in the original but it all feels a bit pointless. It feels too manufactured and false. Like a music video gone tragically out of control. It also doesn't help that editor Kirk M. Morri seems to have gone a bit nuts in the editing room with the camera cutting constantly and scenes having little to no flow in between them. It's all so jarring and it feels like the film is giving you whiplash with the majority of scenes lasting maybe 30 seconds at most before it hastily cuts to the next one. It all just makes for an awkwardly confusing jumble of images that has little meaning.Writer Joel Soisson is a veteran of the cheesy directtovideo sequel market having worked on everything from Hollow Man 2 to Hellraiser 8 to The Prophecy 5. And that clearly shows here as the script is very much in line with the worst of this strange little subgenre in the world of sequels. Like many of the poorer directtovideo features of its era the script is an interesting idea executed poorly... a slapdash attempt at cashing in on a franchise name by taking a highconcept idea that could make for a great followup in this case a sortof twisted take on a lovestory and a gory creaturefeature but only giving it the faintest of thought and development. All so it could be rushed onto store shelves in 2001 in time to capitalize on the booming sales on DVD's of the early 2000's. The script is a cynical effort from a cynical writer.Combine all that with inconsistent set design often generic and flat cinematography lowerquality visual effects work and a smaller sense of scope and scale and you have yourself yet another bad sequel destined to be forgotten and left in obscurity with 99 of the other bad directtovideo sequels of its time.Mimic 2 barely manages to climb it's way to a 3 out of 10. Do yourself a favor skip this one and check out the far more interesting third film instead.";

	schema:headline " The BEST grindhouse film. PERIOD.";
	schema:reviewBody "12 out of Eisener's exploitative 80's grindhouse throwback Hobo with a Shotgun showcasing its brutality shamelessly is easily the best grindhouse film to ever grace the silver screen. Grindhouse Machete and Drive Angry 3D are all strong staples to the beloved subgenre but Hobo is where its at. It's bigger louder and prouder. In all honesty this is one of the goriest films I've seen in a while and it takes a lot for me to say that because even the goriest Saw film doesn't fulfill my bloody craving. The best part about Hobo is not only doesn't it play it safe but there's so much meaning and depth underneath it and is executed so strongly that the message never becomes lost or preachy. Hobo revolves around well... a hobo. An anonymous one at that who witnesses the catastrophes of the city and decides to fight back. First of all the plot is just ingenious. A hobo who's tired of getting picked on and besmirched by the townspeople decides to take a stand. Not only is it a badass story but can't we all relate to the plot? Haven't we all been pushed around too long and just wanted to do something. To be something truly special. Also while the deaths are pretty sick there's more meat on these bones. The film relies on what a film should rely on. Its characters. The relationship between Abby and the hobo is a strong one. I actually cared about these two. What does it say if a film of the title Hobo with a Shotgun has more character development than 95 of the garbage being released today? To put the icing on the cake the production values are sweet. This film has a superb nostalgic look and it's one of the most colorful and vibrant movies projected on screen. But why are we here? For the deaths! And boy do they not disappoint. Eating glass decapitating heads and shots to the head are not even the goriest segments. Actually they're the tamest. Not only that but almost every five minutes there's blood. Whether a dead body in a shot random blood or a kill occurring. This is just a huge blood bath. And a great one at that.Also what I loved about this movie is the lack of gratuitous nudity. I hate how almost every grindhouse flick has to have the need to throw in random boobs or sex in the film. I know it's part of the titillation but it's rather absurd and feels out of context. Hobo had one scene exposing those jugs and it actually fit the mood because of its humor. However it was just THAT scene and wasn't littered throughout the movie.Ignore those reviewers saying they were disappointed because it wasn't what they were expecting. If you're expecting a good time dammit you're going to get one. Two strong leads heaps and heaps of blood a slick story and some solid production values. You're going to tell me that doesn't even get you excited in the slightest? Hobo with a shotgun might just be the best movie I'll see this year. The others have just not delivered on what they promised. How sad is it to see a movie with this title can actually be the best movie of the year when probably half of the Oscar choices will be pretentious dribble. Don't even think about seeing this film. Just do it. Go ahead I'll wait.".

Hobo with a Shotgun is the story of... well the title pretty much says it all. Bad guys led by a enjoyably psychotic gang lord named Drake dominate the unnamed city that is the setting of the movie. Drake and his two equally messed up offspring Slick and Ivan terrorize the people of this tortured city uncontested until the arrival of Hauer's Hobo intent on using his saved nickels and dimes to buy a rusty old lawnmower that will surly start him on a honest rewarding career. Sadly for Mr. Hobo destiny has other plans and our hero uses his mower money to purchase a old pump action shotgun with the intent of cleaning up the city. Along the way he is aided by a prostitute named Abby a stunningly beautiful Molly Dunsworth who has an affinity for destruction. This films greatest strength is its oddball tone and freakishly beautiful bursts of violence that occur periodically through the movie. The chunks of the movie that involve crazy old Rutger Hauer blasting through waves of baddies in brutal fashion and the bizarre acts of violence perpetrated by the films antagonists are easily the highlights and they never fail to delight with their brilliant twisted gore effects. Director Jason Eisener is a master of cinematic displays of blood and guts and god bless him for it because it takes the film to a whole other level. I would love to provide an example for your reading pleasure but tragically spoiling any part of this movie is a crime to heinous to contemplate committing. Just know you will leave the theater feeling like a changed man after the brutal displays of carnage presented. Unfortunately the film is ultimately brought down by some poor scenes that stretched on for agonizing lengths. Many of these involve our homeless protagonist ranting senselessly to his lovely caretaker Abby others involve the already hyperbolically inflated villains plotting the death of the Hobo. Perhaps what is most tragic is that Hauer with the exception several brilliant lines in the films third act never gets a chance to truly shine as the shotgun wielding hero a huge disappointment considering the potential he possessed. Regardless of these flaws the film is still an incredible experience based solely on the incredible displays of creative gore.".

	schema:reviewBody "So you may have a while to wait if your living in the UK for this one to hit your screens with it not due to be released until the middle of the summer but will it be worth the wait? The movie title kind of hints at what is in store if you go and watch this and in that regard it does not disappoint at all. Although you will have to wait a little bit before hobo and shotgun are united in a cacophony of blood and guts.This movie is about a nameless hobo Rutger Hauer who rides the rail and arrives in a new town where the movies intentions are immediately made obvious. As he wanders the streets with robberies prostitution child abduction and hobo fighting occurring all around him we are introduced to Drake Brian Downey the twister ruler of the town and his two sons Slick Gregory Smith and Ivan Nick Bateman. When father and sons decapitate their brotheruncle with a car manhole cover and barbed wire rope we are left with the distinct impression that they rule the roost and are not to be messed with. After observing more obscenities Rutger comes to the aid of a prostitute in trouble Abby Molly Dunsworth and they strike up an unlikely friendship as the movie progresses.Now our hobo's dream is but a simple one he is intent on starting a honest gardening business and gathers his pennies to buy an old lawnmower. However fate conspires against him and he ends up with a pump action shotgun instead and sets about ridding the streets of crime definitely makes for a better story! With one liners as classic as Abby You can't solve all the world's problems with a shotgun! Hobo It's all I know. it's not hard to see the standard that this movie has set for itself! It doesn't take itself seriously but then neither should you.This movie is literally bubbling over with blood and gore left right and centre and leaves little to the imagination. In fact I don't think it leaves anything to the imagination whatsoever. Jason Eisener in his first proper movie as a director knows how to make a bloody scene even more gory than you could imagine. At times the gore looks quite convincing and at others less so but it comes so thick and fast that you won't have time to worry yourself with small matters such as that.If you don't have a strong stomach them I definitely recommend that you give this one a miss and that also goes for people who think that this movie won't involve children in the mayhem because it does and on several occasions as well. I also liked the way in which the movie was done with old school technicolor style credits and titles making the movie feel it was made several decades ago rather than in 2011.All in all this was what I was expecting but in some places it went further than I thought it would. If you are looking for a gore and guts fest with a couple of very cheesy one liners strewn about the place then this does it well and is for you. If your not then I'd give it a wide berth.For further reviews feel free to check out httpwww.fanaticalaboutfilms.com".

	onyx:emotionText "So you may have a while to wait if your living in the UK for this one to hit your screens with it not due to be released until the middle of the summer but will it be worth the wait? The movie title kind of hints at what is in store if you go and watch this and in that regard it does not disappoint at all. Although you will have to wait a little bit before hobo and shotgun are united in a cacophony of blood and guts.This movie is about a nameless hobo Rutger Hauer who rides the rail and arrives in a new town where the movies intentions are immediately made obvious. As he wanders the streets with robberies prostitution child abduction and hobo fighting occurring all around him we are introduced to Drake Brian Downey the twister ruler of the town and his two sons Slick Gregory Smith and Ivan Nick Bateman. When father and sons decapitate their brotheruncle with a car manhole cover and barbed wire rope we are left with the distinct impression that they rule the roost and are not to be messed with. After observing more obscenities Rutger comes to the aid of a prostitute in trouble Abby Molly Dunsworth and they strike up an unlikely friendship as the movie progresses.Now our hobo's dream is but a simple one he is intent on starting a honest gardening business and gathers his pennies to buy an old lawnmower.

	schema:reviewBody "Just by the title I could always tell that Hobo with a Shotgun was going to be a fun bloody action movie and I was completely right. Hobo is a tribute to the old exploitation movies of the 70's based on a fake trailer from the Grindhouse double feature. Another film based on a fake trailer from that was last year's Machete. But Hobo is so much better. The movie is insanely graphic so much that it begins to be a source of comedy. I can't see this film getting anything but NC17 if it does get submitted for a rating.The movie begins with a happy overly bright view of the hobo getting off of a train and entering an unnamed city looking for a new life. Immediately after however the city turns out to be full of crime and violence. The hobo soon buys a shotgun and goes out cleaning the streets of drug dealers pimps and pedophile Santas. The major crime boss of the city doesn't like this and fearing for his reputation he wages war on the hobo and his sidekick Abby.This was definitely one of the most fun movies I have ever seen. This film's ability to throw in a hilarious line in the middle of a heavily intense scene amazes me. There was not a single member of the cast who wasn't insanely good. Two of the best performances came from Gregory Smith and Nick Bateman as Slick and Ivan the hilarious and scary sons of the major crime boss. But Rutger Hauer completely steals the show as the nameless hobo. If this film was more popular I would say Hauer would be up for a Best Actor nomination. His lines are always either comedic or sad. Another thing I loved about this film was how in some moments of extreme violence the camera will tend to linger on small innocent things making the violence very tragic. And the ending it is amazing and you will never see it coming. One of the most powerful endings of a film I have seen in a while.Hobo probably won't be playing at a theater near you unless you live in California or New York City but it is currently available on iTunes for an exclusive rental. I strongly suggest renting it it is worth the 10 you would spend.".

	schema:headline " Hobo with a Shotgun";
	schema:reviewBody "Hobo with a Shotgun was one of the fake trailers in the theatrical release of the 2007 film Grindhouse which featured two films one by Robert Rodriguez and one by Quentin Tarantino as well as a bunch of 70's exploitationgrind house inspired trailers. The grind house films of the 70's were usually made for very little money and they looked grainy and were often over the top with sex violence and all other sorts of depravity and you would most likely see them at the drive in film circuits or late at night as a midnight showings at some cinemas. Several attempts over the past few years have tried to recreate the whole look and feel of the grind house films such as the two films in the Grindhouse feature from 2007 as well as Robert Rodriguez's Machete and now comes Hobo with a Shotgun. Much like Machete Hobo with a Shotgun was one of the fake trailers in the Grindhouse theatre experience and later was turned into a feature film. When I first saw the trailer along with Grindhouse I thought that it looked like it could be turned into an interesting film and then just recently I found out it was actually going to be a film and coming out soon. My anticipation peaked and I could not wait to see it having been a fan of cultexploitation and grind house films since by teen years having grown up on them and still having fond memories of them and even watching them now many years later I still enjoy them. Out of all the cult film experiences of the 70's and 80's that some of these newer films have tried to capture Hobo with a Shotgun is by far the best out of all of them. The plot if you want to call it that is very simple. A hobo comes to a town where it is controlled by a ruthless crime lord and his sons and everywhere you go people are being murdered and the town looks like something out of a post apocalyptic film and the police are not doing anything because they are just as corrupt as the crime lords themselves. Putting aside his dream of one day buying a lawnmower to start his own business the hobo goes and finds a shotgun and starts dishing out vigilante justice on the people who he thinks is ruining the town and the people there. Along the way he befriends a kindly prostitute named Abby and they go after and fight the evil lurking in this town. Right off I am going to say that if you are at all turned off by brutal and sadistic violence or if you are easily offended or grossed out by such things then do not even try watching Hobo with a Shotgun because you will be leaving the theatre and demanding for a refund. On the other hand if you have grown up watching gory horror films and other violent exploitation films from the past and nothing of this type of thing disturbs you one bit and you are a fan of said films then you are going to enjoy this film a lot. The story is simple but that is not a problem as most of the grind house and cult films from back in the day were and this one captures the visual style the dialogue and the over the top violence in a way that makes you feel as if you have time travelled back to the 70's and are watching a brand new film released from that era about a hobo and his shotgun. The film is extremely fast paced and has a kind of energy that I haven't seen in a mainstream release in quite some time. Despite what you think of the film you certainly can not call this film boring or slow. It is full of action and it's a very entertaining ride the whole way through. The film is very dark sadistic and gritty and this may sound weird but I am glad the director did not shy away from that. The old cult films used to show some very objectionable content and get away with it while today if your film comes close to getting an NC17 rating it causes a big stir and you will find it a hard time to get your film released. I am glad that this director and studio had a vision stayed with it and did not compromise to the studio system. Yes the film is extremely morbid sadistic and gross but it is done with so much style and raw energy and a lot of it is so over the top that it didn't bother me in the same way a more serious film would. The visual style of the film was also really interesting to look at and the musical score suited the film perfectly. Also Rutger Hauer who plays the hobo does a great job here. The film is very over the top but he goes with it and pulls the role off perfectly. This is exactly how a grind house movie should be so all other wannabe directors should take note of this film because it's certainly the best we have had in this genre in awhile. A true masterpiece of the genre and I hope it does well when it hits other parts of the world in May.".

	schema:reviewBody "Just because a movie is a grindhouse tribute that is what we're going for here right? the acting doesn't have to completely suck there actually can be some suspense the plot can be kind of coherent. Sure it can be cheesy it can be sleazy it can and should be downright disgusting at times.The one thing it must be is entertaining and HWAS just is not. It's a humorless bloodfest with a script that barely exists. It's what happens when people take the Grindhouse 2006 trailers too seriously. Yes this is funny sit for 2 or 3 minutes. It's unendurable for 87 minutes unless your idea of an action movie is a nonstop video game with all the realism and heart that goes with it.It's really a shame Rutger Hauer got corralled into this crapfest because you can tell in many scenes that he's desperately trying to construct a character where one just doesn't exist. He's really the only light here. The trio of villains are so lame they need to shout and scream laughter constantly to get across that they're badass. The Drake is about as scary looking as Uncle Fester on a bender.The defenders of this film constantly respond to all argument against it with something like it's supposed to be offensive it's supposed to be stupid it's supposed to look like crap... etc. Is it supposed to be incoherent as well? Again my problem with this film is its lack of quality. There's a scene where a villain after torching a bus load of school kids with a flamethrower brutal satire eh? later finds himself hauled away by the ghostly school bus. OK so now we're in the realm of scififantasy too? HWAS has no idea what it wants to do and fails at everything it tries to do.What is truly disturbing about this film is how many supposedly thoughtful critics are being wowed by its ridiculously aggressive hyperbole. If you want amusing tongue in cheek satire that's not badly made rent a Troma release if you want bloody fun go Tarantino Rodriguez or Corman. But if something as nihilistically grim and pointless as HWAS can only get your rocks off see a shrink and fast.".

HOBO is one of those gems.Hollywood as watered us down year after year with sequels remakes and just plain garbage and the true visceral hardcore cinema us Generations Xer's grew up on has been long gone unless you're a gen xer who dabbles in independent filmmaking.HOBO the new feature film based upon the Canadian Faux Grindhouse trailer attached to the Canadian prints of Grindhouse is now making waves left and right around the world.Rutger Hauer in top form is a homeless man who strolls on into to Hope Town a crime ridden haven that would most likely be compared to Hell on Earth.HOBO goes completely over the top and I mean completely over. It crosses plenty of boundaries that have made people standup and cheer or jeer depending on your particular stance on the subject matter at hand.Is HOBO a social commentary on today's world... Maybe. I didn't go into HOBO expecting some type of commentary I went into it hoping for some entertainment and it delivered. Now I will say that HOBO might not been as good without RUTGER... the film does meander at times and some of the other performances while cringe worthy do help this cheesy exploitation flick but it is RUTGER who really makes the film become rememberable.The film does have some moments that most people would immediately criticize as shoddy filmmaking but they in fact add to the indie nature of the film. A couple of times I did see some fundamental filmmaking rules broken but my response to that is... who decided these rules are in fact The Rules I myself break a lot of the rules 180 CU MCU establishing shots etc... why do I break'em... because I don't care and neither should anyone else.Genre film audiences I think will truly enjoy HOBO... however the more mainstream crowd is going to immediately switch this off because of the violenceexploitative nature of the material... which is a shame because HOBO is probably one of the best VIGILANTE films ever made. I kid you not. For any person who has been fed up with the day to day life of crime and other issues in their world HOBO helps you feel like you got the revenge you have so wanted but are unable to act upon because in reality... jail may not be your singular goal in life.HOBO is definitely not for the faint of heart. So those with weak stomach's should seriously avoid this film... but it will be a sad loss because if you enjoy over the top action you get your fill here frame after frame after frame.So from one indie filmmaker to another... thumbs up cast  crew of HOBO.

This movie is very gory rather meanspirited in some if not a lot areas and it's all around over the top. I remember thinking that Crank 2 High Voltage was one of the most over the top movies that I have ever seen but this one has that movie beat.Also I like how Rutger Hauer plays it straight in a movie that isn't so serious to begin with. He did a good job as the title character and he shows that he still has it.All I can say is that if one wants to watch it the person should feel free to but heshe should know what heshe is getting himselfherself into.

What else would you expect from a movie called Hobo with a Shotgun? The filmmakers of this movie in my opinion have created their own genre kind of like Metallica did with Thrash Metal Thrashploitation maybe?. Hopefully we can see a trend going on with this genre because with constant CGI and Hollywood formula it's nice to see a movie that is really different.I thought the crew could have made this movie a bit better but it's their first feature. I hope the filmmakers go on the comment section of this movie and read what they could do to improve their filmmaking as they should progress their talents further.

The plot or lack thereof sorta reminded me of the Death Wishmovies but the atmosphere is very different. Death Wish went for dark realism while Hobo With A Shotgun looks more like a comic book to me. There's so much going on in the way of blood and guts that it's hard to take it seriously but it still has its disturbing moments the school bus scene is an instant classic. In my opinion the main attraction is Rutger Hauer though it's been so long since he's been in anything I wanted to see. Seeing him kick ass again in one of the best roles of his life is just awesome.

You are sure to have fun with this movie if you want to have a good time with a movie check it out. It is sure to be a lovable movie for all ages and by that I mean maturemale audiences. I watched the unrated trailer and it pretty much sums up the movie. The plot is pretty much explained in the title A Hobo With A Shotgun. I really enjoyed listening to the soundtrack to this movie it fit the time of emotion from feeling sad crazy action lots of gore or even watching the hobo on a train in the opening credits. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the plot played out well throughout the movie.To like this movie you can't be offended by extreme violence and lots of gore. May I also warn you that there are some disturbing scenes in this. It was a funny movie and plotwise it was pretty odd. It wasn't all I expected wondering how they could make a movie about a hobo running around clearing the streets of crime with his shotgun to think about this you don't really think that much dialogue could be achieved but they succeeded pretty well. It was very entertaining and good as an allaround movie. If you like action thrillers or just want to have a good time see this movie and you will certainly get what you paid for. It shows a good feeling of hatred toward the bad guys who you really hate. In some movies they try to make you feel like you don't like them but this one did a good job at that. Allinall it was good in it's own strange way unexplainable by words. Watch it if you can get by the excessive violence like having a good time or like action go to the movies or you can even wait for it's release on DVD it will be a great movie either way.".

	schema:reviewBody "OK OK I have seen bad movies but this isn't one. Sure its ridiculous. Some of the acting is way over the top and cheesy but that is the point of it. I enjoyed this film because it didn't try to be serious at all. It had fun and so did the people in the theater I attended with my buddies. People laughed and it got a huge round of applause at the end. We were happy to see a few canucksit was filmed on the east coast so I am biased so for this Canadian it was a plus. The effects look like special effects no CGI. I like this. As someone who is tired of CGI taking over plot dialogue and character a little corn syrup and toilet paper makes for a more enjoyable movie. The movie was so over the top that they even roasted kids in a school bus. There were some plot things that made you scratch your head..like a tentacle monster for no apparent reason? But the movie was a fun B movie that didn't in anyway take itself too serious. There is also a guest spot of David Brunt who was in the original grind house trailer. The two main starshobo and abby did a good job. I have seen Rutger in Omega Doom which was far worse in every aspect than this film.The sound was good and the music and hair styles were reminiscent of the 80swhich I think was the target despite being a grindhouse movielighting was good including some blue lights in the right spots plus the ever gratuitous neon we saw through that decade. Production values were good for what was most likely a low budget film.Now if you want to see bad see Troll 2 The Room Manos The Hands Of Fate or more recently birdemicor any asylum film those are truly bad movies. Bad sound bad acting bad dialogue bad editing. So if you don't agree with my score just compare Hobo against actual bad movies. This is a decent made popcorn flick for the horroraction genre so take it for what it is.".

	onyx:emotionText "OK OK I have seen bad movies but this isn't one. Sure its ridiculous. Some of the acting is way over the top and cheesy but that is the point of it. I enjoyed this film because it didn't try to be serious at all. It had fun and so did the people in the theater I attended with my buddies. People laughed and it got a huge round of applause at the end. We were happy to see a few canucksit was filmed on the east coast so I am biased so for this Canadian it was a plus. The effects look like special effects no CGI. I like this. As someone who is tired of CGI taking over plot dialogue and character a little corn syrup and toilet paper makes for a more enjoyable movie. The movie was so over the top that they even roasted kids in a school bus. There were some plot things that made you scratch your head..like a tentacle monster for no apparent reason? But the movie was a fun B movie that didn't in anyway take itself too serious. There is also a guest spot of David Brunt who was in the original grind house trailer. The two main starshobo and abby did a good job.

I mean come on it's got Rutger Hauer in his usual form oodles of ultraviolence and a general sense of fun perversity. In many ways this film is a throwback to those 70s Rough Justice films the types that Charles Bronson and Clint Eastwood used to star in. Now the story A hobo Hauer hops off a train into the worst city in America overrun with gangs hookers and vigilante civilians. After a couple brushes with the local color which includes two sick puppies who videotape homeless people fighting the hobo buys a shotgun and goes on a rampage taking out gang members unruly civilians and the occasional corrupt cop. The editing and camerawork is stylish. Most of the acting could be put in the gifted and enthusiastic amateur category. But clearly everyone had a blast making this film. So if this is your cup of tea check it out. Also I'd like to take note and mention the company that released it MAGNET. If you see their emblem it means watch this film at once. So far I've seen three of their works THE PERFECT HOST RUBBER and this one. And all three are brilliant!".

He makes Nostradamus a living breathing human being a Christian Jew who is seeking to understand his place in the Universe and is an openminded seeker of truth and a true scientist and physician a dedicated man of science who invented the first chewable Vitamin C tablet made with rose hips as an effective cure for the Black Plague in its early stages. Of course there was no cure once the plague had spread in the body so it must have been especially a cruel twist of fate for Michel when his dear first wife Marie and their two children died of the plague and he could not even save them! The casting acting production story and script and lush cinematography at fascinating locations filmed in Romania and Europe in 1993 are all firstrate. All aspects of this production are extremely wellhandled. Especially good are flawless performances by Julia Ormond Assumpta Serna Amanda Plummer Rutger Hauer Anthony Higgins and F.

The visual effects are a bit shaky here and there but in all everything works well to a satisfying look into the life of one of the greatest mystery men of the early Renaissance. His prophecies are fascinating and penetrating as a latterday prophet. One thing I would love to know is where that beautiful mansion of Dr. Scalinger is and more about it. If it was built during the life of Nostradamus it certainly was one of the most modern structures in the world in its day! An interesting site with its ornate topiary garden.The music score by Barrington Pheloung is captivating and should be available on CD. This film deserves a widescreen DVD release!

	schema:reviewBody "Most Nostradamus movies have him as an older man a gloomy sort constantly predicting doom.  This movie doesn't.  Tcheky Karyo plays a very involved interesting and engaging version of Michel de Nostredame.  I particularly liked the vision sequences where he suddenly is dropped into the future to observe.  I thought the part of the movie where he is confronted by the Inquisition was effective as well.  The movie is flawed it moves slowly and finicky history buffs will find a few bumps.  But overall this features a fine performance by Tcheky Karyo beautiful photography and sets and I have to say a sex scene with Julia Ormond that manages to be really hot and very tasteful at the same time.  Summing up Nostradamus has some strong performances and a good if slow story.  It kept my interest all the way through.  I'm looking forward to getting it on DVD.".

	onyx:emotionText "Most Nostradamus movies have him as an older man a gloomy sort constantly predicting doom.  This movie doesn't.  Tcheky Karyo plays a very involved interesting and engaging version of Michel de Nostredame.  I particularly liked the vision sequences where he suddenly is dropped into the future to observe.  I thought the part of the movie where he is confronted by the Inquisition was effective as well.  The movie is flawed it moves slowly and finicky history buffs will find a few bumps.  But overall this features a fine performance by Tcheky Karyo beautiful photography and sets and I have to say a sex scene with Julia Ormond that manages to be really hot and very tasteful at the same time.  Summing up Nostradamus has some strong performances and a good if slow story.  It kept my interest all the way through.  I'm looking forward to getting it on DVD.";

	schema:reviewBody "Michel de Nostredame generally known as Nostradamus was a sixteenthcentury French physician but is better known today as a reputed prophet and seer. His fame rests on a series of gnomic quatrains which it has been claimed contain predictions of future world events including wars political changes and natural disasters. The problem is that his quatrains are written in a language so obscure that they can be interpreted to mean virtually anything. Those who seek to interpret them generally do so with the benefit of hindsight seeking to prove that Nostradamus predicted World War II the atomic bomb 911 or whatever those seeking to use his works to foretell events which have not yet happened tend to come badly unstuck. Even when a particular quatrain can be proven to have predicted a particular event this is normally done with the help of some creative rewriting or creative mistranslating of his words. Anyone with any knowledge of the French of the period can find some spectacular examples of this on the internet particularly those interpretations which try to prove that by Hister a Classical name for the River Danube Nostradamus meant Hitler.The obscurity of Nostradamus' prophecies was quite deliberate had he clearly and unambiguously foretold specific events which then failed to occur his reputation as a seer would have been destroyed for ever. The film however would have us believe that he deliberately obscured his meaning in order to ward off the attentions of the Church although in the sixteenth century attempts to foretell the future were not forbidden and indeed astrology was regarded as an intellectually respectable and theologically permissible science.As might be clear from my opening paragraph I personally do not believe that Nostradamus possessed a supernatural power to foretell the future. Indeed I do not believe that any human being possesses or has possessed such a power. In the original French his verses have a certain surrealist inventiveness but I have never seen any reason to attribute any other significance to them. This film however is quite openly made on the assumption that its hero did indeed possess prophetic gifts I was left with the definite feeling that Roger Christian was asking me to accept that Nostradamus really was a man tormented by horrifying visions of the future and whose prophecies were intended as warnings to mankind of the fate that awaited them.Now I normally leave my scepticism about the supernatural at the cinema door I have never for example allowed the fact that I do not believe in witchcraft to prevent me from enjoying the Harry Potter films. Suspension of disbelief however is something I find easier to accomplish in the context of a wholly fictional story than in the context of a biography of a real individual. Neither J K Rowling nor the makers of the Potter films are after all asking me to accept that witchcraft has any existence outside the realm of fiction but when a filmmaker asks me to give credence to the writings of a sixteenthcentury charlatan I find it difficult to take his film seriously.Nostradamus has other weaknesses quite apart from its flawed central premise. Unlike many period dramas this one is not particularly visually attractive with dull muddy colours. The action is slowmoving and at times difficult to follow. I understand that Tchky Karyo is a wellknown and respected actor in France indeed the winner of a Cesar Award so I presume that he can act in his own language far better than he can in English. I have never seen any of his Frenchlanguage movies apart from Le Retour de Martin Guerre in which he only had a small part. In the leading role here he is absolutely horrible dull and wooden without any convincing attempt to convey emotions. Some of the supporting cast are better including Julia Ormond as Nostradamus' wife although I was left with the feeling that F. Murray Abraham had come down a long way since Amadeus and Rutger Hauer equally far since Blade Runner. This was the first of Roger Christian's films I have seen and I cannot say that it has inspired me with any great desire to explore his work further. 410".

'Star' of the production Tchky Karyo does not even seem to be able to act in the conventional sense. He is completely expressionless throughout the film and portrays Nostradamus as a rather dislikeable arrogant person who seems to inexplicably attract the ladies at will. Why anyone would deign to talk to him let alone screw him is a genuine mystery. At one point Nostradamus is in a carriage having visions of WWII shouting 'Stop Stop!' over and over. I wonder if the real Nostradamus could indeed see the future and if so could have foreseen this horrible film and been suitably upset by it. Perhaps he was really shouting at the director and writer in this scene. There are some very clumsy moments such as when our visionary shows a pal a symbol that has been perhaps tormenting him  difficult to tell with Karyo's complete lack of facial expression  which is of course a swastika. Cue ominous music etc.Each scene is also longer than it really needs to be with lots of silence and blank expressions supposedly conveying  well what exactly? The film has the feel and style of a made for TV movie just made longer with these pregnant pauses. In fact I think the film is so bad that any change made to it at all could only improve it.If I could take anything away from this film it's that Nostradamus could not see the future at all and was perhaps interested only in promoting himself at any price.

Karyo is a good casting in the title role but he struggles in a fairly flat role. Director Christian who was art director for Ridley Scott's Alien gives the film a handsome old world look but he just ambles through the script that rambles on and on and tells us nothing that we did not know about the future and nothing even about the Nostrodamus himself. The performances and occasional moments of interest keep one's eyes half open but this is missed opportunity on such an interesting subject matter.".

The scenes between old chums Finch and William Holden are some of the best written scenes in any American movie until the Coen brothers emerged. Finch is superb superb! and Holden at the end of a legendary career gives a performance of such ferocious sincerity that I rediscovered the man the actor and felt the need to revisit some of his opus. From Golden Boy to Sunset Boulevard Holden was a man who carried his own discomfort as a weapon. Extraordinary! However the most alarming character in the whole thing is Faye Dunaway's. She is magnificent in her thin nervous braless attitude. She is a monster of commercial amorality. Everything in this incredible movie moves with the precision of an inspired clairvoyant's vision. Duvall's executive Beatrice Straight's betrayed wife and Ned Beatty's god like big shot makes this one of the most frightening entertaining funniest remarkable film from the 70's.

Turn on the news and you see videos of how horrific the war on terror is and how horrific American society has become but it stays on the air because people don't want to see the good things in life. They care about the bad and the corrupt. People must have laughed it off back then but it was such a foreshadow to the near future. The performances are just as brilliant as the social commentary. Each actor becomes so absorbed into their characters that you can't even tell they're acting. It feels like you're watching these people in their daily lives interacting and becoming more and more corrupt. Finch and Dunaway easily give two of the greatest performances of all time.

	schema:reviewBody "Groundbreaking is the term for this movie...It is considered one of the hundred best movies ever made and for very good reason...Director Sidney Lummet has a reputation for the director of the nonconventional!!...A cogency for making the absolute truth a guileless villain a rude awakening for television viewers and a stubborn scripture for facts is what purports a film like Network as a masterpiece for the prolific and intellectual!! You could not ask for better acting!! The acting in this movie is second to none!! Robert Duvall William Holden Faye Dunaway Peter Finch Ned Beatty and a whole list of others...Perhaps the best acting in any film made whatsoever!! It starts with Howard Beale Peter Finch a victim of his own human pitfalls...Ossified and dejected from his declining years going from bad to worse he becomes isolated desultory morbid and morose and feels his life has no meaning he threatens suicide on live television and is discarded as being a wacko!!...At first!!..but guess what!! he's a hit!!...So the ratings crazed cutthroats make him an instant success by labeling him The Angry Prophet Denouncing the Hypocracies of Our Time...As long as we've gone this far let's break all of the rules...Bring on the terrorists the soothsayers the insurectionaries the financial gurus the faith healers and the para military radicals to reduce the severity of hard bitten news to a side show of carnival freaks!!! William Holden plays the old school business man with primal doubts about his life in general...male menopause with defineable features He is happily married yet after being bombarded from all sides in the autumn of his years he is frightened that the new generation is impervious to basic tenets of human morality such as ethics and compassion...The woman with whom he gets involved is callous not because she is vindictive but because she is emotionless!! This woman Faye Dunaway is the Television Incarnate Ice Queen who reduces time and space to split seconds and instant replays the daily business of life is a corrupt comedy and the only redeeming quality to modern marvels and a radiant eruption of Democracy is that it gets a 32 share!!...This acting performance is perhaps the best acting performance I have ever seen...The type of person Dianna Christensen was supposed to be was played out perfectly...The delivery of the elaborated monologues and diatribes were absolutely remarkable....She was ideologically explosive yet personably obtuse. You knew why she wasn't the drinking type...she was too emotionally detached...In the thick of women's liberation whereby a woman wanted to be just like a man this movie portrayed how being just like a man had it's drawbacks!! Arousing quickly consummating prematurely and suffering from the cumbersome fate of being crippled by ineptitude at everything else but your work made Dianna Christensen perennially wistful of testosterone laden aggression!! Aggregately she invoked societal demise through channels of deductive reasoning!! Director Sidney Lummet was insistent that Dianna Christensen be utterly devoid of vulnerability!! Mr Hackett Robert Duvall played the hatchet man for the CCA...A rough around the edges errand boy for Mr Jensen Ned Beatty who viewed this network as his big chance and that whatever worked worked ..Scruples were never an issue and ratings were pending exchange!! Howard Beale Peter Finch the Angry prophet denouncing the hypocrisies of our time surprised even himself with his charismatic clout with the naive television audience!!! He was the UBS starlighted Mad Prophet of the airways...He could arouse anger and counterculture overzealousness just by appearing crazy!!! One speech Mr Jensen Ned Beatty was a bit role but incredibly powerful in his delivery of the basic concept that ideology is for sale and that television is the ultimate vehicle for manipulation!! Paddy Chayefsky is pioneer with this film as an acrimonious depiction for making world phenomena such as the fall of Communism and landing man on the moon to be minimized to a market share!!!..The terms entertainment and egalitarianism now became pejorative!!!! The movie audience is hit with the terrifying reality that a societal caprice will induce the avaricious to capitulate to human catastrophe...Give Paddy Chayefsky and Sidney Lummet credit for unveiling the revelation that ratings and the dollar take precedence over humanity!!! Howard Beale the decrepit alcoholic euphemistically transformed to the prescient paragon of intuitiveness was alright so long as his innocuous chastisements did not disrupt worldwide pecuniary acquisitions!! Once they did he was quelled and thus deemed a total ratings chart disaster!! Ultimately Howard Beale the once disheveled dipsomaniacal curmudgeon turned Messianic Savonarola becomes the typification of the corporate guinea pig!!!!This movie is avantgarde in it's ability to convey the message of greed first democracy second or third depending on the sponsors of the Howard Beale Show... An incident was determined traumatic or not traumatic by it's lucrative marketability potential!! Terrorism is not terrorism if it means ratings!!! The character assassination of all the people in this movie was at the grass roots level!! Their avoidable flaws were entrenched as irreconcilable!! Any people with any conscience whatsoever William Holden  his wife were decimated by reveille with selfishness now it is imperative that they pick up the pieces!! How many imitations of this movie have there been...thousands!! Network however was the first movie of it's kind to effectively portray the concept of dying Democracy and dehumanization probably the best movie of it's kind as well... This is an illustration of how heinous tragedy has to be stomached by the television audience their response to clinical trauma transcends the impact suffered by the actual victims involved!! It is a proverbial case of ratings eclipsing reality!! The film Network resonates itself to a point whereby the American people are reduced to meager byproducts of the Fortune 500!! I wish there could be a movie of this caliber made again!! I am angry that there has not been a sensationalistic masterpiece to come around for some time and I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!!!".

	onyx:emotionText "Groundbreaking is the term for this movie...It is considered one of the hundred best movies ever made and for very good reason...Director Sidney Lummet has a reputation for the director of the nonconventional!!...A cogency for making the absolute truth a guileless villain a rude awakening for television viewers and a stubborn scripture for facts is what purports a film like Network as a masterpiece for the prolific and intellectual!! You could not ask for better acting!! The acting in this movie is second to none!! Robert Duvall William Holden Faye Dunaway Peter Finch Ned Beatty and a whole list of others...Perhaps the best acting in any film made whatsoever!! It starts with Howard Beale Peter Finch a victim of his own human pitfalls...Ossified and dejected from his declining years going from bad to worse he becomes isolated desultory morbid and morose and feels his life has no meaning he threatens suicide on live television and is discarded as being a wacko!!...At first!!..but guess what!! he's a hit!!...So the ratings crazed cutthroats make him an instant success by labeling him The Angry Prophet Denouncing the Hypocracies of Our Time...As long as we've gone this far let's break all of the rules...Bring on the terrorists the soothsayers the insurectionaries the financial gurus the faith healers and the para military radicals to reduce the severity of hard bitten news to a side show of carnival freaks!!! William Holden plays the old school business man with primal doubts about his life in general...male menopause with defineable features He is happily married yet after being bombarded from all sides in the autumn of his years he is frightened that the new generation is impervious to basic tenets of human morality such as ethics and compassion...The woman with whom he gets involved is callous not because she is vindictive but because she is emotionless!! This woman Faye Dunaway is the Television Incarnate Ice Queen who reduces time and space to split seconds and instant replays the daily business of life is a corrupt comedy and the only redeeming quality to modern marvels and a radiant eruption of Democracy is that it gets a 32 share!!...This acting performance is perhaps the best acting performance I have ever seen...The type of person Dianna Christensen was supposed to be was played out perfectly...The delivery of the elaborated monologues and diatribes were absolutely remarkable....She was ideologically explosive yet personably obtuse. You knew why she wasn't the drinking type...she was too emotionally detached...In the thick of women's liberation whereby a woman wanted to be just like a man this movie portrayed how being just like a man had it's drawbacks!! Arousing quickly consummating prematurely and suffering from the cumbersome fate of being crippled by ineptitude at everything else but your work made Dianna Christensen perennially wistful of testosterone laden aggression!! Aggregately she invoked societal demise through channels of deductive reasoning!! Director Sidney Lummet was insistent that Dianna Christensen be utterly devoid of vulnerability!! Mr Hackett Robert Duvall played the hatchet man for the CCA...A rough around the edges errand boy for Mr Jensen Ned Beatty who viewed this network as his big chance and that whatever worked worked ..Scruples were never an issue and ratings were pending exchange!! Howard Beale Peter Finch the Angry prophet denouncing the hypocrisies of our time surprised even himself with his charismatic clout with the naive television audience!!! He was the UBS starlighted Mad Prophet of the airways...He could arouse anger and counterculture overzealousness just by appearing crazy!!! One speech Mr Jensen Ned Beatty was a bit role but incredibly powerful in his delivery of the basic concept that ideology is for sale and that television is the ultimate vehicle for manipulation!! Paddy Chayefsky is pioneer with this film as an acrimonious depiction for making world phenomena such as the fall of Communism and landing man on the moon to be minimized to a market share!!!..The terms entertainment and egalitarianism now became pejorative!!!! The movie audience is hit with the terrifying reality that a societal caprice will induce the avaricious to capitulate to human catastrophe...Give Paddy Chayefsky and Sidney Lummet credit for unveiling the revelation that ratings and the dollar take precedence over humanity!!!

Fox News reality TV even the OJ chase Network anticipates every vile bit of it.Now it's ridiculously overwritten  NO ONE is as articulate as the characters in this film and most certainly no one who works in television is as literate as Diana Christensen the Faye Dunaway character. I doubt that poet laureates or even Eminem could spew as witty an aside as muttering mutilated Marxism. But damn if that isn't part of its charm. Plus outside of Max Schumacher William Holden the characters are pretty much archetypes instead of real people the Robert Duvall character might as well wear a black cape and top hat but their twodimensionality works as a good metaphor for Max's seduction into the shrieking nothingness or television. Plus the actors are so superb they make screeching caricatures into almostsympathetic characters Duvall is a credible and charismatic villain Finch is a fine mad prophet and Faye Dunaway manages to make a shrill manipulative soulless neurotic so damn cute and sexy you'll want to leave your wife for her too just as long as she promises to keep sitting crosslegged on your desk and hitching up her skirt. Therein lies the real eroticism forget the intentionally mechanical unerotic coupling later in the flick. Anyway this is complex high art masquerading as popular entertainment go rent it now.".

	schema:reviewBody "Network. If there was ever a film that foreshadowed to events of the future it would be Network. Much like Midnight Cowboy seven years earlier Network was hailed because it took risks and it was like nothing that the cinema had ever experienced before. Both films were great when they were initially released but few great films become so much better with time like Midnight Cowboy and Network. The fictional fourth network of 1976 is UBS. Ratings are bad and the network desperately needs some new show to give them a boost to challenge NBC CBS and ABC. Enter the network's national news anchorman Peter Finch in his posthumous Oscarwinning role. He like the network is going through a crossroads. His wife has just passed away he is about to be fired and he is slowly losing his mind. The firing is imminent and he decides that he will announce to the world that he will commit suicide on his last evening news broadcast. Of course a national frenzy starts but Finch surprises all by showing just how crazy he is. Instead of committing suicide he goes on the air and becomes a modernday Moses to some with crazed ravings and outlandish statements that really are just the ramblings of a man slowly spinning outofcontrol. Faye Dunaway Oscarwinning and Robert Duvall are the key people at the network who find a way to market Finch and boost anemic ratings. Finch is given a variety show which could be best described as The Tonight Show gone starkraving mad. He gets on stage and basically says whatever is on his mind and the crowds love it. Coworker and close personal friend William Holden Oscarnominated knows that Finch is out of control but cannot do anything and eventually is let go due to his disapproval and interference. Holden though has fallen in love or lust with the unfeeling Dunaway. Wife Beatrice Straight in an Oscarwinning performance in which she has less than 10 minutes of screentime learns of what is going on and more trouble ensues for Holden on the homefront. Finch meanwhile continues his ravings as he hears voices in his head telling him what he must do each time he is asked to perform. Soon his act grows stale as the public tires of his antics and the network must always defend speeches that they themselves do not really understand. Finch's 15 minutes of fame eventually come to an end but not in the conventional way that one may think. Network is a cinematic masterpiece because it is so strong in the major elements of the industry. The acting is exceptional. There were five performing nominations from this film Ned Beatty was the fifth and three wins. The only other film to accomplish that was A Streetcar Named Desire from 1951. Sidney Lumet was great before this film but he became even greater afterwards. This is arguably his greatest directing job. The screenplay by Paddy Chayefsky is one of the smartest ever written. It is insightful and has a real depth to it. Network was looked upon as a sort of farfetched black comedy in 1976. However Network is a film that is all too realistic 25 years later. In many ways the fictional UBS station is much like the FOX station which came on the air in the late1980s and stole audiences with wild shows that were quite different from the other three networks. Reality television perverted talk shows and other types of variety programming run wild today. Network did not have much to do with all this occurring but it is like those who worked on the film had a crystal ball into the future. A great movie that becomes greater as time passes. 5 stars out of 5.".

Today media is all the rage and televises even a fart if it deems it interesting and guarantees more viewers. Today shows like 2020 or 60 Minutes bring us 'exclusives' even if it's at the cost of journalistic integrity. And now with 'reality TV' still the dominating novel trend even in littleseen cable channels creating stereotypes in leaps and bounds while claiming authenticity of the events depicted there hasn't yet been a need to create a lunatic who could sermonize everything and make us Mad as Hell. On this aspect alone NETWORK has dated the 70s were all about counterculture antiestablishment revolution leftists Patty Hearsts Lennon and Yoko Nova the Mansons the hippies the Earthlovers the militants. Nowadays buff bodies parade themselves in shows containing outlandish competitions where eating the most grotesque concoctions are the norm or enduring a barrage of extreme insults has become entertainment i. e. American Idol and the very concept of dignity flies out the window. Of course after signing an extensive release form in which they free the network of all responsibilities if something goes wrong because we all know networks can't be held liable for any faux pas. In short nowadays people from all over try to become the next It person and outlast their 15 minutes of fame. Nowadays everyone has their own reality TV show depicting their 24 hour day activities. I wonder if Diana Christensen isn't alive and well and exerting absolute control over the networks in general bringing anything and everything that can garner a little bit of shock value Boy Meets Boy or any reality TV selfmade villainvillainess and eventual ratings taking over actual scripted shows with real actors.NETWORK is a powerful movie of which I can't praise enough about even if its screenplay by Paddy Chayefsky is a little too verbose. No one talks the way he makes his characters talk using impassioned speeches with big even archaic words and more than once the script makes the characters go completely over the top but even then it makes its point. Of the actors William Holden's quiet portrayal of a former television exec Max Schumacher who has a conscience but still feels some attraction to danger and risks his own family to experience is who is at the heart of this crazy story who was ahead of its time. Peter Finch's Howard Beale never comes through enough as a real human being just someone who was pushed too hard and decided to shut down for the remainder of his life. But Holden holds the moral glue of the story and interestingly enough is wise to know that his affair perfectly scripted as he even states will end on a high note  he'll return to his sanity and his wife and Diana Christensen will bask in her own executive madness since this is all she knows and holds dear. In her last words  Let's kill the son of a bitch.  she informs us this is all she is about without so much as batting an eye. Who comes who goes is irrelevant to her as long as the network can be number one. And that is the inhuman reality of television  a media directed to entertain humans.".

This film is shocking and eyeopening also showing executives' mad quest for ratings.The acting in this film is superb. Peter finch stars as the TV anchor who becomes an angry prophet who denounces the hypocrisies of our time. We gradually see how he first preaches to the common everyman but is then exploited by the slick executives to achieve their one goal Ratings. Faye Dunaway also shines as the Vice President in charge of programming who finds herself becoming less aware of the difference between television and reality. William Holden also lends fine support.As the acting and directing in this film are exquisite the message it portrays is a very strong one. This scathing indictment of TV is necessary for everyone to see.".

	schema:headline " A Great Film About 20 Years After  Before It Was Needed";
	schema:reviewBody "This film though not noticed enough now is one of the great films. Peter Finch put just about everything he has into Howard Biel. In fact he died of a heart attack after the film was released and he was out promoting it. Certain films have impact and this one still does.In a way this is a higher budget bigger star update of the 1950's film A Face In The Crowd starring Andy Griffith and Patricia Neal. Howard Biel is very much the character Lonsome Rhodes was in that film. The difference is that while the earlier film went totally off the deep end this one stops at just the right spot. The issue Howard Biel highlights here of Foreign Money and Big Corporations and Big Government taking over the world and screwing the little person well let's fast forward to when it happened after the movie was made.When Government decided it had to tax Senior Citizens Social Security benefits for starters as this requires some Senior Citizens as high as in their 90's to have to file income taxes. Then they are paying taxes on top of benefits they earned that were already taxed.Then in the 1990's Howard Biel would have come in handy when NAFTA passed by a corrupt Federal Government which had started in 1986 to offshore jobs by changing the Federal Tax Code the working man needed someone to stand up and say We're Mad As Hell and we're not going to take this anymore! Black people needed it when a huge Federal Program threw thousands of blacks in jail during the 1990's too. Then when the Big Banks talked a willingly corrupt government in the 1990's into deregulating them removing restrictions FDR put in place to prevent the system from another 1929 meltdown we needed Biel again.Then in the 2000's when big drug companies bribed a government into passing a drug law that made them wealthy and then allowed them to put out dangerous new drugs like opoids without regard with what they do to the public? Of course then 2 political parties who have disregarded any chance of term limits and have made themselves rich by sucking the taxpayers dry like kittens do their momma cat?Could a real Howard Biel have really done anything about that? Unfortunately the answer is no because the big corporations big money mass media and corrupt governments appear to have won since this movie was made. Even though there are 2 great films warning us this could happen we are at a point today where a whole lot of little people are no longer counted in a system that is rigged.Yes we should be Mad as Hell about it but the out of touch media and those kittens living in a glass bubble still have not woken up as reality is being more hidden today than it was in 1976.With William Holden Faye Dunaway and a huge cast Sidney Lumet brings off a classic here that even has cameos from John Chancellor and Walter Cronkite. This movie portrays things as they are. Heed the warning and educate yourselves as to what has happened since 1976. Even today's protesters need to watch this to really understand what they are doing and why.".

	schema:reviewBody "1 Best Film of 1976'Network' is Paddy Chafesky's riveting and grim tale of the sleaze surrounding the American television industry. Winner of the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay 'Network' is without a doubt one of the most powerful influential and meaningful films ever made. One of the reasons 'Network' was so well received by both film critics and moviegoing audiences was because it possessed a certain quality that most films unfortunately lack  intricate and involving characters in realistic situations. 'Network' definitely makes my list of the top 10 films of the 70s and it's an absolute shame it didn't pick up the welldeserved 'Best Picture' Oscar at the Academy Awards ceremony in 1976.The film follows a lowrated television network trying to keep it's head above water. The network UBS has decided to fire an aging veteran news anchor Howard Beale Peter Finch in an act of desperation to boost ratings. Beale is given a twoweek notice and instead of going out with his tale between his legs Beale announces on live television he was fired and is going to kill himself. This raises panic and chaos at UBS until they get the memo that Beale's crazed rant just bumped the ratings significantly. The UBS execs Diana Christensen Faye Dunaway and Frank Hackett Robert Duvall decide to give Beale his own show where he complains and screams bout the problems with the world while Beale's best friend William Holden feels it's inappropriate for the network to take advantage of a mentallyill man. Besides exploiting a mentally unstable man the company execs also work out a weekly program with a antiestablishment AfricanAmerican communist Laureen Hobbs Marlene Warfield following political terrorists and their violent outbursts.The film also stars Beatrice Straight as Schumacher's boring wife Conchetta Ferrell was an assistant working for the network and Ned Beatty who plays the sinister boss of the UBS television network who always gets what he wants.'Network' boasts one of the finest and most intricate screenplays ever written that rightfully earned Paddy Chafesky the Oscar for Best Screenplay. Sidney Lumet's directing is absolutely incendiary and the movie has an incredibly strong cast. Faye Dunaway gives what is perhaps her very best screen performance as the cutthroat Network executive while Robert Duvall is just as brilliant as the ruthless Frank Hackett which should have earned him an Oscar nomination period! Beatrice Straight is solid in her role not quite Oscarworthy if you ask me though and Marlene Warfield is just as great as the sassy pinko sistah excuse me for that phrasing. The two performers who really steal the show however are William Holden and Peter Finch. Both nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role at the Academy Awards in 1977 Peter Finch gives a startling and powerful performance as the 'madashell' not to mention crazyashell Howard Beale while William Holden gives a subtle but nonetheless outstanding performance as the conflicted Max Schumacher. It's hard to say who was better but if I absolutely had to decide I'd choose Holden's nonOscarwinning performance slightly over Finch's sympathy Oscarwinning performance he still was extraordinarym though. I honestly believe if Finch hadn't died just after the film Holden would have taken home the Oscar gold for Best Leading Actor both were still magnificent though. The only player in the cast that I felt wasn't that great was Ned Beatty. In a role fardeserving from an Oscar nomination which he for some odd reason received Beatty plays the angry little man role he always does. Besides Beatty's performance and marginal pacing problems towards the middle you are gonna get that in any 70s film that isn't a Kubrick film the movie is utterly perfect.I can't recommend you seeing 'Network' highly enough. If you want a carefully made motion picture that makes you think and reflect on how cutthroat our society has become especially TV broadcasting 'Network' is a absolute must. What are you waiting for go out and rent 'Network'! It might just alter your perspective on things. Grade AMADE MY TOP 300 LIST AT 46".

William Holden and Peter Finch should have both received Oscars for their performances instead of just Peter Finch. Faye Dunaway pulls of the most dynamic and emotional characters she has ever played.The true brilliance of this film is that all elements of it fade appropriately behind the actors and their messages. The film is completely a work of storytelling and at least for the writer stunning clarity of message and purpose. Political films come and go but few remain in the annals of film because of their effectiveness at their own message. The cinematography editing sound costume design art direction and production design are all quite simplistic. In some scenes the film can be accused of being almost ugly. However this all lends to the backwashing of the film so as to allow the message to ring loudest. In my opinion Sidney Lumet took this just a little too far and thus I give it a 9 instead of a 10.This is certainly a film for the history books. Every connoisseur of film should be exposed to this movie at some point in their life. If you happen to be cynical then you will love every minute of this movie as its stark view of life in the 1970's and onward touches the hard of even the hardest of cynics.

	schema:headline " Eerily prescient classic";
	schema:reviewBody "I'M MAD AS HELL AND I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE IT ANYMORE!One of the most famous lines in film history is as impactful today as it was when it was first uttered by fictitious news anchor Howard Beale in Paddy Chayefsky's seemingly parody of where TV and TV news is heading 1976's NETWORK.The astonishing thing about this terrific motion picture is how prescient it is. News is now entertainment. Appeal to the disaffected masses. Drive our message to the viewers. Be provocative. The 600 news had less than 1 minute of hard news the rest was sex scandal brutal crime sports children with incurable diseases and lost puppies.Sound familiar? This isn't from today it came from this movie that was made 42 years ago as a cautionary tale of what might happen.Besides the social ramifications how does this film hold up? Quite well indeed. A rare 10 star BankofMarquis film. Starting with the great Paddy Chayefsky's Oscar winning Screenplay. This was the capper on a brilliant career from Chayefsky  who also won Oscar's for his screenplay for 1972's THE HOSPITAL I'll have to check that one out and 1956's MARTY.What does a terrific screenplay do? It attracts toplevel talent clamoring to be in this  and they all deliver. Start with Faye Dunaway who won the Lead Actress Oscar for her role as Entertainment Head Diane Christensen  a driven work hard play hard individual who has the idea to make news entertainment. Lost in the fog of time and MOMMIE DEAREST is the fact that in the mid1970's Dunaway was perhaps the greatest leading actress of the day and her skills are in sharp display in this film.Joining Dunaway in terrific supporting turns are Robert Duvall following his turns as Tom Hagen in GODFATHER I and II as network head Frank Hackett Ned Beatty as Ned Jennings President of the company that owns the network  he has a speech towards the tail end of this film that is as good  both in performance and in the way that it is shot  as anything put upon the screen  it was masterful. Speaking of masterful Beatrice Straight won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress in one of the shortest performances to ever win. She is in this film for about 6 minutes in total  but she won her Oscar for a 5 minute scene that is most definately Oscarworthy.And then there are the leading men. William Holden gives one of the last great performances of his extraordinary career as the voice of reason in this film. He is our everyman caught up in the bizarre absurd circumstances that evolve around him. It is his effort to try to make sense of this insanity that jumps off the screen. Holden was deservedly nominated for a Best Actor in a Leading Role Oscar but lost rightfully so to Peter Finch's turn as crazed newsman turned prophet Howard Beale. His maniacal but not over the top turn is one for the ages. If you do nothing else see this film for his performance but there is so so much more to love here. Unfortunately Finch passed away from a heart attack in between his Oscar nomination and win and was the first posthumous winner in an acting role sadly Heath Ledger would join this club years later.Finally enough cannot be said about Sidney Lumet's direction. A movie like this would not succeed without a sure steady and seasoned hand at the helm  and this is how I would describe Lumet's direction. He lets the camera roll and lets the actors and the screenplay take center stage not drawing attention away but adding to the themes of the film throughout  especially in Beatty's speech at the end.NETWORK was nominated for but did not win the Oscar for Best Film of 1976. Did it lose out to other nominees ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN or TAXI DRIVER? Nope it lost to ROCKY.Let that sink in.If you get a chance to watch or rewatch this film I highly recommend you do so. For me it was GREAT to watch this on the big screen with an audience one of the reasons I love  and will continue to attend  the SECRET CINEMA series of films.Letter Grade A10 out of 10 stars and you can take that to the BankOfMarquis".

	onyx:emotionText "I'M MAD AS HELL AND I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE IT ANYMORE!One of the most famous lines in film history is as impactful today as it was when it was first uttered by fictitious news anchor Howard Beale in Paddy Chayefsky's seemingly parody of where TV and TV news is heading 1976's NETWORK.The astonishing thing about this terrific motion picture is how prescient it is. News is now entertainment. Appeal to the disaffected masses. Drive our message to the viewers. Be provocative. The 600 news had less than 1 minute of hard news the rest was sex scandal brutal crime sports children with incurable diseases and lost puppies.Sound familiar? This isn't from today it came from this movie that was made 42 years ago as a cautionary tale of what might happen.Besides the social ramifications how does this film hold up? Quite well indeed. A rare 10 star BankofMarquis film. Starting with the great Paddy Chayefsky's Oscar winning Screenplay. This was the capper on a brilliant career from Chayefsky  who also won Oscar's for his screenplay for 1972's THE HOSPITAL I'll have to check that one out and 1956's MARTY.What does a terrific screenplay do? It attracts toplevel talent clamoring to be in this  and they all deliver. Start with Faye Dunaway who won the Lead Actress Oscar for her role as Entertainment Head Diane Christensen  a driven work hard play hard individual who has the idea to make news entertainment. Lost in the fog of time and MOMMIE DEAREST is the fact that in the mid1970's Dunaway was perhaps the greatest leading actress of the day and her skills are in sharp display in this film.Joining Dunaway in terrific supporting turns are Robert Duvall following his turns as Tom Hagen in GODFATHER I and II as network head Frank Hackett Ned Beatty as Ned Jennings President of the company that owns the network  he has a speech towards the tail end of this film that is as good  both in performance and in the way that it is shot  as anything put upon the screen  it was masterful. Speaking of masterful Beatrice Straight won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress in one of the shortest performances to ever win. She is in this film for about 6 minutes in total  but she won her Oscar for a 5 minute scene that is most definately Oscarworthy.And then there are the leading men. William Holden gives one of the last great performances of his extraordinary career as the voice of reason in this film. He is our everyman caught up in the bizarre absurd circumstances that evolve around him. It is his effort to try to make sense of this insanity that jumps off the screen. Holden was deservedly nominated for a Best Actor in a Leading Role Oscar but lost rightfully so to Peter Finch's turn as crazed newsman turned prophet Howard Beale. His maniacal but not over the top turn is one for the ages. If you do nothing else see this film for his performance but there is so so much more to love here. Unfortunately Finch passed away from a heart attack in between his Oscar nomination and win and was the first posthumous winner in an acting role sadly Heath Ledger would join this club years later.Finally enough cannot be said about Sidney Lumet's direction. A movie like this would not succeed without a sure steady and seasoned hand at the helm  and this is how I would describe Lumet's direction.

	schema:reviewBody "This satirical masterpiece is considered by experts to be one of the greatest movies ever made. This website ranks it 197 out of the top 250 movies ever created. AFI American Film Institure ranks Network one of the top 100 American films 66 to ever be produced. The phrase I'm as mad as Hell and I'm not going to take it anymore is ranked the 19th most famous quote ever in the history of the cinema by AFI. Last but certainly not least the script for Network is rated as the eighth best script ever written according to discerning critics of the Writer's Guild of America East. This last accolade is one for which I wholeheartedly concur with. Originally the film Network was inspired by an incident which involved a possible corporate takeover of the ABC News Division back in 1970. The entire matter of a corporate takeover of a network news division initiated an outburst of creative genius from Paddy Chaefsky The writer of Network to address the dubious repercussions of such a corporate megalomaniac's scenario. Should a corporation take over a major network's news division the ultimate goal of huge profits would compromise the journalistic integrity of the news as well as the news' tenacious objective for hard bitten accuracy! The film Network became a cult sensation which fascinated the movie audience. The traumas of terrorism and apocalyptic catastrophe are reduced to numbers on a conceptualization analysis chart which crossed the table of a Madison Avenue boardroom! Their degree of doom and despair is measured in terms of marketability potential! Tummultuous radicalism became relegated to the mundane process of contractual consent decree. Basically Howard Beale was a deteriorating news anchorman for UBS whose neurotic compulsions escalated into a Nielson ratings bonanza. Within the realm of exaggeration all occurrences in this movie were acrimoniously plausible! The unprecedented talent in Network is unbelievable. Sidney Lumet was a director who was driven by the uncompromising efforts of New York Theatre. Peter Finch and Faye Dunaway were performers who had an enormous amount of theatrical experience this was advantageous to the support of their roles in Network. Other performers in this film William Holden and Robert Duvall were actors who were known for their straight shooter intensity and their ability to cogently focus! Network was a film which depicted a bevy of left wing coups and wanted criminals to be an auspiciously cunning carnival show for caricatured reprobates. Each character in the movie had their own brand of emotions William Holden Max Schumaker was always afflicted with one sordid conundrum after anotherthis always left him ethically challenged. His wife Beatrice Straight Who won an Academy Award for best supporting actress with her characterplayed the part of the proverbially injured party.Peter FinchHoward Beale who won the Oscar posthumously for best actor with this role became an overnight pop culture icon who was perpetually agitated. Howard Beale belonged in one of three places Bellvue Believe it or Not or the third one which wound up being his choice Prime Time Television. Robert Duvall Frank Hackett was the corporate yes man who thought everything could conform to a Fortune 500 pie chart. Ned Beaty Arthur Jensen was the dictatorial disciple who explained to all parties involved that euphemistic phraseology and showbiz buzz words were simplistic subterfuges which corporations used to accommodate their precarious quest for the almighty dollar. Finally Faye Dunaway Diana Christensen was the television induced purveyor for ratings popularity.. For her corporate callousness was a by product of lucrative business decisions. Faye Dunaway's performance as Diana Christensen was perhaps the single greatest performance that I have ever seen in any movie whatsoever. A performance like this has the potential to spoil the writers of a movie script! Such esoteric dialog that Network possessed straddles the fence of liability which can be made or broken on a performer's delivery. Such a stellar delivery of the lines in this movie by Faye Dunaway could very well be perceived as a windfall of reassurance to the writers directors and produces of this film. Suffice it to say Faye Dunaway won for best actress in 1976 with her role in Network. The single greatest attribute which an actor or actress can garner with a part is the quality of having a totally comprehensive control of the part in which they are playing.Prime examples of actors with this quality are Al Pacino and Kevin Spacey Faye Dunaway's performance in Network indeed epitomizes such a remarkable feat! The ability to detach yourself from the mechanical persona which you have assumed in a movie cultivates a zenith in professionalism with it emanates an idealistic state of mind! This performer's dichotomous isolation establishes a necessary bluntness for their character thus making it easier for that character to be effectively entertaining! Faye Dunaway's portrayal of Diana Christensen was one whereby the utterly heartfelt responses of a human being were very derivative for her realizing that she confined herself to her work. The fact that she was impervious to compassion devoid of vulnerability and insensitive to joy was what made Diana Christensen's stilted demeanor vicariously devastating to any decent individual with whom she encountered! Director Sidney Lumet was vehement about requiring that the character of Diana Christensen remain academically ruthless all throughout the entire film. His purpose for doing this was to see to it that she would purport an essential mass media concept which made this movie extremely powerful. This omnipotent concept advocated a sub humanoid philosophy that unfortunately establishes rudimentary ground rules for the disconcerting and virulent world of television. This film was spectacular! Why Network lost out for best picture to Rocky is very inconceivable to me! Paddy Chaefsky and Sidney Lumet were brilliant! All of the actors and actresses were magnificent!! The fact that it did not win for best picture in 1976 leaves me with only one thing to say I'm as mad as Hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!!".

	schema:headline " everything anyone would want from a movie";
	schema:reviewBody "I loved this movie. It totally blew me away. My roommate recommended it and it was beyond amazing. The writing perfect and just created a world that was utterly insane but more real than a lot worlds created by the movie industry. The whole world of network television is just put in another light when watching this movie. I was not alive for the heyday of network news but it had to be so much better than it is today. Watching current news programs it is exactly like watching the Howard Beale show. It was scary and sad but still managed to be funny. Funny in an uncomfortable way. There are a lot of layers to this movie and I have only watched it once but I am sure a lot more would be revealed as I watched it again. First of all lets comment on the acting. Top notch and I see how so many Oscars were given out. At first Faye Dunaway's performance seemed too flat but by the end of the movie one sees why it was acted like it was and it was perfect. The perfect tragic figure that did not change and did not learn a lesson just because it was easier for her to continue her life like she always have even knowing it was wrong and would never give her happiness. Nothing needs to be said about Peter Finch's performance except wow. The next performance that stood out was Ned Beatty and his whole scene was film perfection. As he starts his speech to Beale the shot is perfectly crafted and even being such a small spot on the screen he fills and it and gives a damn memorable speech that almost evokes Emerson maybe not in tone so much but it was still there. As he calms down the camera moves in but he is no less engaging. I like how they managed perhaps by accident able to convey the racism of the time and in the media. The fact that the movie started out as a movie about a news network and managed to turn them into terrorists and murders in such a short period of time was amazing.

Top notch writing and one of the better scripts I have encountered in a while. I am going to seek out more of his movies and see what else this guy is capable of.

	onyx:emotionText "I loved this movie. It totally blew me away. My roommate recommended it and it was beyond amazing. The writing perfect and just created a world that was utterly insane but more real than a lot worlds created by the movie industry. The whole world of network television is just put in another light when watching this movie. I was not alive for the heyday of network news but it had to be so much better than it is today. Watching current news programs it is exactly like watching the Howard Beale show. It was scary and sad but still managed to be funny. Funny in an uncomfortable way. There are a lot of layers to this movie and I have only watched it once but I am sure a lot more would be revealed as I watched it again. First of all lets comment on the acting. Top notch and I see how so many Oscars were given out. At first Faye Dunaway's performance seemed too flat but by the end of the movie one sees why it was acted like it was and it was perfect. The perfect tragic figure that did not change and did not learn a lesson just because it was easier for her to continue her life like she always have even knowing it was wrong and would never give her happiness. Nothing needs to be said about Peter Finch's performance except wow. The next performance that stood out was Ned Beatty and his whole scene was film perfection. As he starts his speech to Beale the shot is perfectly crafted and even being such a small spot on the screen he fills and it and gives a damn memorable speech that almost evokes Emerson maybe not in tone so much but it was still there. As he calms down the camera moves in but he is no less engaging. I like how they managed perhaps by accident able to convey the racism of the time and in the media. The fact that the movie started out as a movie about a news network and managed to turn them into terrorists and murders in such a short period of time was amazing. The directing was amazing but with such a good script and with such quality actors it cannot be hard to make such a masterpiece. Not to belittle with Lumet did because he made the movie from the start feel flat and by the end of the movie made it perfect. the best part of the movie was the writing.

	schema:reviewBody "One thing you got in 70s cinema as the 60s generation began to grow up and relaxations on content stopped being threatening and started being normal was that the message movie went mainstream. Understandably the eloquence of the message was always going to be more important than its real importance.Network was scripted by Paddy Chayefsky who was less the angry young man of the antiVietnam generation and more the grumpy middleaged man of any and every generation. Appropriately enough the picture is a cynical and grouchy rant. It is preachy hysterically so in places and yet it is so pessimistic offering no solutions to the problems it builds up to ridiculous proportions that watching it is a rather draining experience. Its message is not as clever as it thinks it is conflating a new technology with ongoing social problems as shortsighted cynics have done for centuries. There is even a nonetoosubtle dig at women who take on masculine roles which just goes to show how bitter and reactionary Network is. And the idea of someone so obsessed with an idea it causes them orgasm prematurely is simple a sad mix of bad psychology and playground puerility.And yet the 70s were also a time in which Hollywood was starting to regain some semblance of professionalism after the unevenness of the previous decade. Network seems to have been made by a highly consistent production team. Sets and costumes are designed to perpetuate a pattern of regular black and white shapes arranged in rows. Not just ceiling lights or skyscraper windows but filing cabinets radiators all conform to this same style. Director Sidney Lumet with his usual mode of subtle stylisation even keeps it up in the few outdoor daytime with the even framing of the treelined boulevard in the scene after Ruddy's funeral. Lumet also often has opposing shots of two actors with one in bright white and the other in black so the switching backandforth between them is like a light flicking on and off.The 70s was also a time in which acting really started to successfully reconcile dramatic realism with theatrical exuberance and here we have some great examples of both. William Holden looking decidedly weary and craggy seems to have entered the age which suits his style best and he brings a layer of genuine humanity which Network sorely needs. Beatrice Straight gives a small yet impassioned performance as his wife and though barely five minutes long her performance is among the more memorable. Another excellent bit performance is that of Ned Beatty whose glorious hamming is the complete opposite of Straight's straightness but nevertheless provides one of the most entertaining scenes of the whole picture. Of course any more than a few minutes of screen time and these two performances would unbalance the entire thing. Which brings us onto Peter Finch who again is pure ham but of the classic Charles Laughton variety putting every ounce of strength he has into a compelling act. Had it not been Lumet's policy to ensure the realworld cinema screen never becomes the same as the filmworld TV screen we in the audience would be truly mesmerised by those mad prophet speeches.And thus Network delivers its message with great force and power. And of course the film has now gained a new raft of fans because this banal grumble about TV was supposedly ahead of its time except that TV never has been and never will be quite that way because audiences  human beings  are not as stupid as Chayefsky thinks they are. In fact the thing that Network probably best predicts is the wave of movies like Fight Club that didn't really say much but said it with an original twist and thus became cult hits. Which is a pity. And now if you'll excuse me I'm off to watch the new series of XFactor which though lowbrow at least makes good entertainment.".

	schema:reviewBody "An unusually restraint film for a Fulci picture made in the early 1980s.  A picturesque vision of gothic horror that's done in the style of an Italian gothic or Hammer horror film from the 1960s.  I think Fulci's attempt here was to make a film in the manner of Hammer horror or Corman's Poe pictures which would involve little of the director's usual gory antics.  There are some violent scenes and the most brutal scene in terms of gore or death is the one involving Lillian Grayson.  Il Gatto NeroThe Black Cat1980 relies more on atmosphere mood and tension than gory set pieces which was a change of tune for Fulci after the bloody violence of Zombie1979 The Smuggler1980 and City of the Living Dead1980.Its not one of his best works but it is a beautiful looking film with some gracious camerawork and impressive visuals.  Based loosely on the Edgar Allen Poe short story of which this film has no direct relationship to the plot of that horror story.  The closet the film comes is during the sequence that comes near the very end of the picture.  The climax is an encore of the climatic moment in Sette Note in NeroSeven Notes in Black1977.  The POV of the cat prowling around during the opening credits scene is handled with visual spectre by Sergio Salvati.The casting of Patrick Magee as Robert Miles is one of the best parts of The Black Cat1980.  Magee gives a performance that shows why he was a master in playing eccentric and mentally troubled characters in films like A Clockwork Orange1971 and MaratSade1970.  One of five or six excellent actors to have a role in a Lucio Fulci film.  He portrays in his character emotions of fear hate and menace just by his expressions of his face and eyes which are more effectively presented when viewing the film in widescreen.  Atmospheric and eerie use of its British locales that rivals that of Jorge Grau's Let Sleeping Corpses Lie1974.One scene which reaches the dreamlike style of Fulci's other gothic pics from the early 80s is the moment when the house that Jill Travels lives in shakes and rocks around in a frenzy after the hanging Miles cat.  Its an eerie sequence that is one of the best in the film.  Daniela Doria once again plays a character who comes to a gruesome endseems to be her only function in a Fulci film.  David Warbeck does ok as Inspector Gorley but his performance here is nowhere near as good as in The Beyond1981.  The Mrs. Grayson death scene borders on the effective and ridiculous without moving totally into the realm of the latter.Mimsy Farmer gives a bland performance here that is short of the good performances given by Catriona MacColl who was better at making a Fulci's heroine a little more dimensional.  The editing is smooth looking and fluid compared to the erratic editing of City of the Living Dead1980 which was a weakness for that film.  The death of Ferguson is crafted with hand shaking suspense and a creative payoff.  Fulci's director is flamboyant and yet simple in the same time.  Overall an entertaining horror film that is one of Fulci's most underrated films and one despite its flaws is worthwhile for anyone that loves Eurohorror Fulci horror or just horror films in general.".

Il Gatto NeroThe Black Cat1980 relies more on atmosphere mood and tension than gory set pieces which was a change of tune for Fulci after the bloody violence of Zombie1979 The Smuggler1980 and City of the Living Dead1980.Its not one of his best works but it is a beautiful looking film with some gracious camerawork and impressive visuals.  Based loosely on the Edgar Allen Poe short story of which this film has no direct relationship to the plot of that horror story.  The closet the film comes is during the sequence that comes near the very end of the picture.  The climax is an encore of the climatic moment in Sette Note in NeroSeven Notes in Black1977.  The POV of the cat prowling around during the opening credits scene is handled with visual spectre by Sergio Salvati.The casting of Patrick Magee as Robert Miles is one of the best parts of The Black Cat1980.  Magee gives a performance that shows why he was a master in playing eccentric and mentally troubled characters in films like A Clockwork Orange1971 and MaratSade1970.  One of five or six excellent actors to have a role in a Lucio Fulci film.  He portrays in his character emotions of fear hate and menace just by his expressions of his face and eyes which are more effectively presented when viewing the film in widescreen.  Atmospheric and eerie use of its British locales that rivals that of Jorge Grau's Let Sleeping Corpses Lie1974.One scene which reaches the dreamlike style of Fulci's other gothic pics from the early 80s is the moment when the house that Jill Travels lives in shakes and rocks around in a frenzy after the hanging Miles cat.  Its an eerie sequence that is one of the best in the film.  Daniela Doria once again plays a character who comes to a gruesome endseems to be her only function in a Fulci film.  David Warbeck does ok as Inspector Gorley but his performance here is nowhere near as good as in The Beyond1981.  The Mrs. Grayson death scene borders on the effective and ridiculous without moving totally into the realm of the latter.Mimsy Farmer gives a bland performance here that is short of the good performances given by Catriona MacColl who was better at making a Fulci's heroine a little more dimensional.  The editing is smooth looking and fluid compared to the erratic editing of City of the Living Dead1980 which was a weakness for that film.  The death of Ferguson is crafted with hand shaking suspense and a creative payoff.  Fulci's director is flamboyant and yet simple in the same time.  Overall an entertaining horror film that is one of Fulci's most underrated films and one despite its flaws is worthwhile for anyone that loves Eurohorror Fulci horror or just horror films in general.";

	schema:headline " It may not be Fulci's best but I like it";
	schema:reviewBody "Fulci's The Black Cat is freely adapted from Poe's story. I suppose that freely adapted means that the last 10 minutes might bear a vague resemblance. The Black Cat is the story of a man who uses his psychic abilities to force his cat to kill for him. But the tables soon turn when the man tries to kill the cat. The cat becomes master and uses the man.The more Fulci I see the more impressed I become. I started out with a couple that many people list among their favorites The House by the Cemetery and City of the Living Dead and neither did anything for me. But now that I've seen The Beyond The Black Cat A Lizard in Woman's Skin and Don't Torture a Duckling my opinion has changed. I now see the genius of Fulci that I've heard others rave about over the years. The Black Cat may not be his best but it's an enjoyable Gothic thriller with loads of atmosphere. While the gore quotient may be turned down there's still a few scenes that are undeniably Fulci.Patrick Magee in one of his final roles gives a very solid performance as the mad psychic. He effectively displays a wide array of emotions and is generally believable in each. Magee really was in the same class with the likes of Karloff when it came to portraying menace. Mimsy Farmer costars as a photographer who is as dull as dishwater.The cinematography is another area that stands out. Sergio Salvati presents some very noteworthy camera work. Chief among the scenes that stand out are the ones shot from the cat's point of view. The way the camera moves through the grass just as a cat would are very nicely done.The weakest point of the movie as is so often the case with Italian horror is the plot. Much of it makes little sense. For example why does Magee really want these people dead? There's no clear motivation from what I could tell. Also there are several plot threads that look interesting but are not explored in any detail. The example I'll cite here is the exploration of the ruins. They look interesting but we learn nothing about them and only see them in one ten minute stretch of the movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is without a doubt my all time favorite movie about a homicidal cat. The cat is the main masterpiece of this movie it is personified beautifully Lucio Fulci gives the cat it's own character which makes the whole piece very eerie indeed. The idea of having a cat especially one that looks as evil as the one in this movie doing the killing is different fun and strangely it works! The murders that the cat commits are inventive and imaginative and overall this is a very decent movie which deserves a lot more praise than it's getting.Lucio Fulci has directed a few movies that have won high praise among horror fanatics The Beyond and Zombie Flesh Eaters most notably but this movie easily deserves equal praise. Unlike the majority of Fulci's repertoire The Black Cat is low gore and relies more on the Gothic and eerie atmosphere to deliver it's scares  and it works a treat. The film based on a story by the master of Gothic horror Edgar Allen Poe is set in a quiet town in England and follows the story of Professor Robert Miles Patrick Magee that is able to control the mind of his cat in order to take out his vengeance on various people. One of the best things about this movie is the way that the relationship between man and cat is presented. We can almost feel the antagonism between the two characters shown by the cat attacking Magee and him saying that the cat will eventually kill him. This movie features some sequences that are at the very top of horror cinema most notably the very creepy and atmospheric sequence in which Magee attempts to strangle the malevolent animal. Lucio Fulci is able to direct this scene so it both believable and frightening. His direction throughout this movie is competent and throughout the movie it is surprising that this is a movie by the same man that brought us the disgusting zombie gorefests due to it's level of constraint.Overall The Black Cat is an excellent slice of horror cinema that is unfairly criticized and criminally overlooked. Fulci fans may not like it because of the lack of gore but if you like creepy atmospheric horror films you will love The Black Cat.".

	schema:reviewBody "Featuring as it does as homicidal and nastytempered a feline as has ever been shown on screen Lucio Fulci's The Black Cat 1981 is certainly not a film guaranteed to appeal to the average ailurophile. Although the picture jettisons most of Poe's 1843 short story from which little but the title remains it still tells an interesting tale indeed. In it we meet Robert Miles intensely played by veteran actor Patrick Magee in one of his last roles a crusty eccentric living in a small English village whose two main hobbies seem to be recording the voices of the dead in a local cemetery and avoiding being mauled by his pet the titular black tabby. American photographer Jill Trevers the attractive Mimsy Farmer investigates after a wave of homicides sweeps through the small town. Along for the ride in a small part is Dagmar Lassander here sporting a good deal more avoirdupois than in say 1970's Forbidden Photos of a Lady Above Suspicion but still giving a blazing performance nonetheless. Fulci's direction here is typically stylish replete with stalking cat's eye POV and more closeups of eyes in general than you've ever seen probably in excess of 100 such closeups I'd guesstimate and Pino Donaggio's intriguing title tune does set the baroque mood nicely. Many events in the film go unexplained that levitating bed for instance and that hangingcat etching and a repeat viewing did not help me understand things any better than the first. Though hardly a giallo per se the picture does feature any number of grisly murders even if there is never a mystery for the viewer as to who the fourlegged culprit is. A rampaging bat sequence late in the film seems almost a direct lift strangely from an earlier Fulci film 1971's Lizard in a Woman's Skin. Still any movie with cats rats AND bats can't be all bad right? And oh...another greatlooking DVD here from the always dependable Anchor Bay.".

Miles should have known that the black cat had nine not one lives and that it would soon come back to get even with him for what he did to it with a wild and ferocious fury that even heit's former master couldn't even in his wildest dreams imagine or comprehend.Hard to find but very effective killer cat movie with Patrick McGee in his last movie role playing the crazed Professor Robert Miles who together with Mimsy Farmer as the American photographer Jill Trevers have some of the most extreme and mindboggling close ups ever put on film. The black cat itself is also very scary as it moves towards and stalks it's victims and you forget for a while that it's really a common house cat.You look at the killer feline as if it were an instrument of death and terror conjure up by the Devil himself straight out of hell. The movie Black Cat has a very hypnotic feel to it maybe because of it's many unusual and almost microscopic closeups and the ending is anything but a letdown like you would expect from a movie like it.

That being said this film is not for the faint of heart. If you watched it with your grandma or someone who has not been jaded by the blood and guts in Italian horror films you'd see it from a different side. A dude gets impaled a girl burns to death rotting corpses are found in a hot boat shack and a cat repeatedly rips the flesh off a guy's face goring him up. I mean it's not New York Ripper but it's not a slasher film. It's more like a giallo.This film is most notable for the brilliant cinematography. The shots from the cat's point of view are awesome. And then there's the excellent acting for a Fulci film. Mimsy Farmer is decent! And the other dude Patrick Magee from Clockwork Orange isn't bad either. Better than other Fulci stuff for sure.The fact that the acting is above par and the fact that there isn't a constant onslaught of gore has contributed to the low rating on here. The film is a good giallostyle horror movie and it oozes with old school ambiance and mood. The soundtrack is great and all in all it's a great adaptation of the Poe story.I recommend it to Italian horror fans who can stand to be entertained without seeing people get disemboweled.7 out of 10 kids.".

Better than other Fulci stuff for sure.The fact that the acting is above par and the fact that there isn't a constant onslaught of gore has contributed to the low rating on here. The film is a good giallostyle horror movie and it oozes with old school ambiance and mood. The soundtrack is great and all in all it's a great adaptation of the Poe story.I recommend it to Italian horror fans who can stand to be entertained without seeing people get disemboweled.7 out of 10 kids.";

The sequence in which the feline stalks and kills a drunk villager who saw too much is almost like a lesson in genuine tension. Bravo Lucio! Patrick Magee A Clockwork Orange and multiple Bhorror classics looks familiar with his role of crazy cat owner and Mimsy Farmer Autopsy is very good as the American photographer unraveling the supernatural mystery. To finish up there are some neat and unexpected plot twists a moody score and some very imaginative camerawork.

All clues point to an eccentric local mediumPatrick Magee but the real mystery is the connection between the psychic and the black cat that seems to show up at the scene of each crime.Lacking the trademark Fulci gorewhat there is is very brief the film focuses on atmosphere. There are a few nice touches in widescreen format the cat's eye view stalking scenes and the close ups of character's eyes to show emotion work very well but what keeps the mood from ever really taking off is the cat itself. Given enough screen time to be billed as a full cast member Fulci never really succeeds in making the animal look possessed or menacing.In most of its close ups it looks like your average house cat albeit a bit peeved that you were late with the kibbles and bits. The cheesy snarling sound effects every time it attacks don't help either.The humans leads are no better across the board wooden acting with Magee forced to carry viewer interest in the film by hamming it up as much as possible. Helped along by the overly zealous score it's amazing that this movie manages not to be as silly as Touch Of Death.Overall an amusing trifle but those looking for gore are better served by just about any other Fulci horror film and those interested in atmosphere are much better served by watching The Beyond where the director truly mastered the form.4.5 stars".

The work of Edgar Allan Poe has been brought to screen on many occasions most brilliantly by Roger Corman with seven films starring the great Vincent Price in the early sixties. Poe's story The Black Cat in particular has been filmed on various occasions most memorably probably by Sergio Martino with his 1972 Giallomasterpiece Your Vice Is A Locked Room and only I Have The Key. While it has hardly anything to do with Edgar Allan Poe's story Gatto Nero aka. Black Cat 1980 is a creepy and unusual film by Lucio Fulci which is especially interesting for its uncanny Gothic atmosphere.A small English village has been struck by a series of bizarre murders. After the investigating Scotland Yard Inspector Gorley David Warbeck asks Jill Mimsy Farmer an American photographer for her help it soon becomes clear that the black cat of the local psychic Professor Miles Patrick Magee was involved in all the crimes. Miles who has psychic powers is suspected of being responsible for the murders but it seems as if his cat is also committed to killing her owner... In this rare case a vengeful or evil character of a cat is not merely suggested but the cat is actually a murderous key character of the film. The storyline may not always be 100 logical but it is definitely intriguing and the film maintains a creepy atmosphere from the beginning. The English village is a great setting and the murderous black cat is actually a villain far more vicious and interesting than one might imagine. Partick Magee A Clockwork Orange Masque Of The Red Death... is great as always in his creepy role. Beautiful Mimsy Farmer a regular female lead in Italian Horror films Four Flies On Grey Velvet Autopsy The Perfume Of The Lady In Black... fits in her role well and is nice to look at as always even though she keeps her clothes on this time. The cast also includes David Warbeck and Al Cliver both of whom are regulars of Italian HorrorExploitation productions. This is not nearly one of Fulci's goriest films but there are still a bunch of welldone and pretty nasty gore scenes. The best aspects of the film are doubtlessly its stylish Gothic looks genuinely creepy atmosphere and brilliant score as well as the incredibly sinister Patrick Magee and the premise of a murderous cat. Overall The Black Cat is not one of the absolute mustsees by Fulci but it is definitely an original creepy and highly atmospheric flick that should not be missed by lovers of Italian Horror. Highly recommended!".

It's a supernatural thriller made with more restraint on Fulcis' part than usual not that there isn't any gore there's still some nice gruesome bits to enjoy. It's full of familiar faces and is filmed on a variety of real English locations and sets.Set in England it's freely adapted from the Edgar Allan Poe tale as it tells of mysterious deaths occurring in a small country village populated by people such as snooping photographer Jill Trevers Mimsy Farmer and Professor Robert Miles old pro Patrick Magee in one of his final roles a crotchety old man attempting to communicate with the dead. As Jill and the intrepid Inspector Gorley David Warbeck also of Fulcis' The Beyond work the clues she can't help but notice the cat scratches left on more than one victim. Could a demonic little feline really be the culprit?Beautiful cinematography by Sergio Salvati extremely impressive camerawork by Franco Bruni and Roberto Forges Davanzati wonderful music by the prolific Pino Donaggio and a pervasive weird atmosphere are all assets of this well told reasonably absorbing mystery. It's certainly fun to watch the cast in this thing. Warbeck is a delight as the cop Mimsy is very sincere in her performance Magee is excellent as always and Fulci regular Al Cliver Zombi 2 The Beyond sexy Dagmar Lassander The House by the Cemetery and the lovely Daniela Doria recipient of a lot of abuse in Fulci films round out the cast.The Black Cat is entertaining stuff that finds its director in fine form always keeping his audience on edge. He does go for the closeup of human and feline eyes an awful lot but this doesn't distract too much from the various spooky goings on including one absolutely harrowing scene of a house and person catching on fire.Recommended to Fulci fans.Eight out of 10.".

The locals are wary of a medium named Professor Robert Miles Patrick Magee who claims he can speak to the dead  owns an ominous black cat. Two teenage lovers Maureen Daniela Doria  her boyfriend Stan disappear without trace since local bobby Sergeant Wilson Al Cliver isn't up to the job Scotland Yard send Inspector Gorley David Warbeck to sort things out.

Inspector Gorley realises he has a real case on his hands  enlists the help of photographer Jill to record the crime scenes  help out to add to the growing list of 'accidents' it's not long before the bodies of Maureen  Stan are found. When Maureens mum Lillian Dagmar Lassander dies Jill  Gorley are convinced that these are not random accidents  discover strong evidence to indicate that Professor Miles black cat was present during each incident...Cowritten  directed by Lucio Fulci I liked Il Gatto Nero even if it doesn't make a lot of narrative sense. The script by Fulci  Biagio Proietti based on the short story by Edgar Allen Poe is a bit of a mess to be honest none of the victims are really connected to each other or the killer  as a whole Il Gatto Nero feels a little unfocused  loose jumping from one murder setpiece to another without much regard for what happens between them the script could have been a bit tighter. The characters are undeveloped  are nothing more than cardboard cutouts but I personally didn't mind that much as there is just about enough there to keep things moving even if it's not particularly coherent. The end  the eventual revealing of all the motivations behind what's going on  the unmasking of the villain is too spread out it would have been more effective if it all came out during the last 10 or 15 minutes rather stretch it out over 20 odd minutes  I must admit that the end wasn't exactly a great surprise. Il Gatto Nero has to be one of Fulci's best looking films  I love it's atmosphere location cinematography  style. The quaint idyllic English village is great whether it's during the day with it's fresh greenery  cottages or at night with it's darkly lit streets enshrouded in thick fog. From Professor Miles Gothic mansion with terrific dungeon type crypt underneath  richly decorated rooms to the old house the drunk Ferguson wanders into with it's exposed brickwork  peeling plaster. From cobweb strewn corridors  tombs to spooky graveyards Il Gatto Nero is a wonderful looking film throughout. In fact my score  liking for Il Gatto Nero is probably based more on the look  feel of it rather than it's somewhat weak  thin storyline sometimes it felt like a teen slasher film with a cat as the killer murdering random people. Technically the film is solid director Fulci uses light  dark extremely well as he composes his shots he films certain scenes from various cool angles  he constantly uses closeups on peoples  cats eyes for some reason  I'm glad he did he throws in plenty of cat pointofview shots too. Il Gatto Nero is a visually impressive film much more so than I was expecting  I think cinematographer Sergio Salvati deserves a mention. The gore  violence is toned down compared to Fulci's Zombi films but there are still some good kills here a car crash victim is shown someone is impaled on spikes in the films best gore scene shots of a burning woman  her body  a few cat scratches  mauling plus an old skeleton. The acting is as good as one can expect from a Euro horror  familiar faces Magee Warbeck  Cliver are fun to spot  watch. I liked Il Gatto Nero a lot  I would probably watch this again over most of Fulci's gore films for which he is most remembered for. It's a splendid looking film but it would have helped if Fulci had fleshed the script out a bit more maybe he could have connected the victims together better  perhaps come up with a slightly stronger ending. Still Il Gatto Nero is definitely worth a watch  much better than I was expecting!".

	schema:reviewBody "Italy's 'godfather of gore' Lucio Fulci serves up less splatter and more atmosphere than usual in this surprisingly enjoyable movie loosely based on a story by Edgar Allan Poe about a malevolent moggy murdering people in rural England.Fulci's directorial decisionmaking is sometimes questionable just how many closeups of eyes do you need in one film? but with a reliable cast that should be familiar to fans of Italian horror some nice cinematography several creative deaths which whilst not as quite as gory as in other Fulci efforts are still quite horrific and a wonderful score from Pino Donaggio this often overlooked Gothic tale is actually pretty good.Set in a small English town The Black Cat sees the titular feline causing a series of deaths after tapping into the suppressed hatred of its psychic owner Patrick Magee. When the crazy medium finally cottons on to what is happening he tries to do away with the cat drugging it and then stringing it up from a tree. But the whiskery menace is no ordinary puss returning from the dead to exact revenge on its ungrateful owner.Mimsy Farmer also stars as a pretty American photographer caught up in the supernatural mystery along with David Warbeck as a police inspector from the city who is called in to help solve the mystery and Al Cliver as a local rozzer.A lot of Fulci fans might be put off from watching this effort by the fact that it doesn't contain graphic scenes of eye impalement head drilling or gut vomiting preferring instead to concentrate on generating an eerie vibe. I suggest even if your love of Fulci is purely down to his usually overgenerous servings of gore that you still give The Black Cat a chance.The death scenes in this one might not be as violently OTT as in his better known films but Fulci doesn't entirely wimp out on the nastiness there are a couple of burnings an impalement and one unfortunate couple get nibbled on by rats. Plus you get a story that mostly makes sense.And in a Fulci film you can't really ask for much more than that.".

	schema:reviewBody "One thing I often have a problem with when watching Fulci is not his gifted truly blessed stylish touch particularly how well he can film faces and use the dark so ominously and effectively..it's his unfocused often incredibly peebrained plots. This plot has this bizarre idea that a man named Robert Miles fueling with a repressed hatred for others such as a past ladylove can force a cat through hypnotic suggestion to attack otherswhile as we see in the opening kill the cat itself possesses a driver to send his car straight into a parked vehicle..which means that Miles possesses the cat which possesses another man. Alrighty then.. Then the story shifts where the cat can make Miles do it's bidding after the exprofessor attempts to kill it. Now I didn't understand how this mumbo jumbo works so maybe you can tell me. Anyway various victims fall prey to the cat such as a local drunk who falls on a pitchfork a womanMiles ladylove who gets burned alive in her house a young couple who are seen on the floor with foam coming out of their mouth?! and Inspector GorleyDavid Warbeckof Scotland Yard who is forced by the cat to walk in front of a moving car!. JillMimsy Farmer a topnotch photographer is in the village to lense old ruins. She comes in contact with both Miles and the cat when she hears men chatting about the mad psychic professor in a pub. Immediately her life is in great danger especially after she's asked to take crimescene photos and notices several cat claw gashes on a victim's handthe drunkard who receives the pitchfork in his torso. And the young couple found deaddue to information Miles provides his former ladylove begging for his assistance in finding her missing daughterhad locked their door from the inside of the shack where they were found leaving only a tiny duct as the only entrance in..for which Jill sees cat footprints in sand within that duct exit. So the cat's identity is threatened. But as Jill seeks after the truth will she be able to survive Miles' wrath or be trapped within a mortared wall never to be seen again?In this film Fulci uses a really cool camera trick by lensing from the eyes of the cat as it heads for a particular destination suggesting to the viewer that possible death was imminent. Fulci also loves to focus the camera in on the crazed..and at times focusedeyes of Patrick Magee a really intense actor who has the ability to show facets of madness so incredibly and convincingly. Fulci creates some really foreboding shots of his mad face within the dark. The film is quite Gothic with Fulci very dependent on fog as a mood piece. Not overtly violent but gets it's point across. There are some nasty moments when the cat attacks the hands and face of certain victims. But this is at it's best an exercise in style..which Fulci can give to us in abundance.".

Pino Donaggio's score is perfect making this one truly atmospheric film. As for the performances they're a mixed bag. Leading stars Patrick Magee and Mimsy Farmer are excellent and probably way to good to be appearing in these sort of films but their presence really helps. David Warbeck on the other hand gets too little to do even though he too is good. As for Dagmar Lassander she still looks as unearthly divine as she did in the 1970s. Too bad her role isn't big enough. The other actors are not particularly interesting.THE BLACK CAT lacks the amount of gore that can be found in Fulci's other early 1980s efforts but it is still a very good film that should not be missed by serious admirers of European horror cinema.".

One of its better features here is the fact that this one really goes for the exceptional Gothic atmosphere which not only belies its source material but also works for the film as a whole. The general concept of the socialist investigating the dead in the manner depicted here using the different paranormal instruments in a quest to unlock the secrets of life after death feels incredibly Gothic in origin while also managing to work in a typically Gothic reasoning that ultimately ties them together. As well that forces the film into the scenes of him into the fogenshrouded graveyards tampering with his tools or walking along the streets as it rolls along making for a wholly chilling atmosphere for this one. Another enjoyable feat here is that their connection to each other also gives this one some really enjoyable attack scenes featuring the cat which for the most part are pretty shocking in concept and rather realistic in execution. The opening attack in the car gets this one going along nicely the ambush of the couple inside the boating house comes off as really chilling once they've realized they're trapped and the stalking of the lone victim on the town streets as it continually leaps out of the darkness all give this one quite a lot to really love about this one by employing really fun action scenes. Still the film's best scenes here are the cats' stalking of the drifter into the abandoned warehouse where it chases him onto the upper floors before leading to a spectacular death and a great scene of it intentionally starting a fire in one victims' house while they're still inside leading to a grand finale which is quite actionpacked here which makes for rather impressive scenes here. As these scenes not only give off some nice gore effects and the ability to see the cats' impressive skills at work these here hold this one up over it's few flaws. One issue with this one is the excessive use of closeups throughout here which gets tiring very quickly as character's eyes and nose ridge are onscreen more than the cat is. There's an extremely alarming amount of them spread throughout by just about all of the characters and they become distracting after a while. Another big problem is the almost incredulous plot. The fact that the cat is never really dismissed as a potential suspect is quite troubling as the fact that a little cat can take out large victims is passed off as being plausible from the very start. Strangely in a film like this it needs to hedge the doubt about it a little more especially from the police inspectors to make their contributions a little more believable. The film's biggest problem though is the pacing which spends a lot of time doing nothing in particular which leads to a lot of downtime in here. Otherwise there's not much to dislike here.Rated R Graphic Violence Brief Nudity Language and violence againstanimals.".

	schema:reviewBody "The reason for a sequel says Bullock is that Marc Lawrence writer and producer and I found ourselves on numerous occasions imagining what Gracie would have gone on to do after her big triumph at the pageant and how all the media attention would have affected her. Yeah. I'm gonna take a wild one and say the fact that the original made over 300 million including domestic AND worldwide gross rentals and DVD sales probably had a little something to do with it as well.Let's be honest here do you really need a review to convince you of whether or not you want to see this? Seriously if you watch the trailer and read this review and STILL see the movie then I don't want to hear any complaints. Walk out of the theater with a smile on your face or I'll put one there OK? Otherwise don't see it. Come on you're not really expecting something fresh and original are you? Have you read the plot line? Miss Congeniality 2 obviously runs a predictable path. Gracie is originally reluctant to become Ms. FBI Barbie but then she embraces the role and becomes a wee bit too wrapped up in it. But wait! William Shatner and Miss America are kidnapped! So it's off to Las Vegas to run a little PR. Enter Treat Williams as the Las Vegas FBI supervisor Collins who has ambitions of writing his own book and doesn't care for Gracie coming in and stealing his thunder. You might as well have cued the sinister music and given him a Cheshire cat to pet and a handlebar mustache to twirl.It'll come as a shock to approximately three sub70 IQ viewers that Collins disregards Gracie's attempts at helping and begins to steer the investigation in the wrong direction. You know what that means right? Time for Gracie to shed the FBI Barbie image and go back to her old ways! Somebody call up Memento and let it know that a new master of unpredictability is here and its name is Miss Congeniality 2 Armed and Fabulous! OK so not really. But who cares? The movie ramps up the cheese the stupidity the silliness and the camp and it revels in it. The best thing I can say about this sequel is it knows exactly what it is it knows exactly what its audience wants it knows exactly how ridiculously overthetop everything is and it doesn't care one whit what the critics think. There's no shame to be found here and for that I tip my hat.I'll be honest if you try to put a movie like this on the shoulders of Julia Stiles or Kirsten Dunst then I'm running screaming for the exit like I'm Haley Joel Osment at Neverland Ranch. But I love Sandra Bullock and she has the charm and the personality to make me smile at the stupidest stuff. She trips about 24 times dances at a drag club in a ridiculous outfit lays a beatin' on a 6'7 behemoth to the tune of Spiderbait's Black Betty and she forces me to be entertained by it. Admit it she has a knack for making insanity absolutely adorable.Oh and who can forget the addition of a partner! Regina King the girl from 227 is an FBI transfer with anger management issues. She's assigned as Gracie's bodyguard and she has a bad habit of overextending herself physically. Yep you guessed it they don't initially get along. Can you see hijinks and shenanigans ensuing? I think you can! Is this a great movie? Not by any means. It's not even as good as the original a big reason being that William Shatner is regretfully underutilized although he does have a great line about his friend being run over by a milk truck. Oh and go ahead and make sure you bring your little yellow bucket to puke in during the final scene. A producer somewhere obviously spoke up and said Hey we're one awwinducing scene short of our quota and thus the final scene was born.But you just have to accept that and the fact that this is a comedy that'll have you shaking your head and rolling your eyes more than once. In fact I should be ashamed to admit that I let myself enjoy it as much as I did. But if you go into the movie expecting to have a good time then you should walk out satisfied. The screening audience absolutely loved it. Granted proclamations such as That is the best movie I've seen this year! are a bit much but this is indeed a movie that knows its audience and plays to it effectively.Are you expecting high art? If so then you really need to learn how to better analyze movie trailers. You also need to learn how to better analyze movie titles. Armed and Fabulous? One of the great absolutes in life is any time a movie tries to be cute and makes a play on words with a common phrase in this case armed and dangerous in its movie title then you better have a tent with you because mama it's time to set up camp! The only thing missing here is a cameo by Adam West.I think I'm gonna follow the trend. I'm gonna write a script about baseball called America's Pastime where the home team loses the championship. However they will get their revenge in the sequel  America's Pastime 2 Payback's a Pitch. It's gonna rule. You know it and I know it.Bottom line America  how often in life will you get the chance to see Sandra Bullock in boxers and a tshirt all while sportin' some long shiny straight hair? At the very least there is entertainment value in THAT! sighs wistfully Rating 3 out of 5".

	schema:headline " Bullock shines in a comedy that lacks laughs";
	schema:reviewBody "Sandra Bullock returns as Gracie Hart the federal agent who went undercover at the Miss United States pageant four years ago. When the pageant emcee Stan Fields William Shatner and Miss USA Heather Burns are kidnapped in Las Vegas Gracie needs to put aside her cushy lifestyle on the talk show circuit to go back into action taking on a very unhappy new partner in Sam Fuller Regina King.Miss Congeniality 2 Armed and Fabulous isn't as good as the original but it still manages to deliver some funny scenes. The original was a fun harmless movie though nothing memorable. The sequel falls under the same category but it's not nearly as much fun as the first film. Actually the fun factor is only seen in Bullock and King everything else was poorly handled. Sure there were some fun moments but certainly not enough to sustain the really long running time. Also Michael Caine and Benjamin Bratt don't appear in the movie. I miss Caine since he was pretty funny in the first one. I don't really miss Bratt because he's not that good of an actor.The acting is pretty good and it's the best thing the movie has to offer. Sandra Bullock gives a funny and enjoyable performance as Gracie Hart. Her charm is what carries this sequel and she proves to be a delight on screen. Regina King also gives a funny performance and she's a nice addition to the series. The chemistry between Bullock and King is great and their scenes together is what drives the movie. William Shatner and Heather Burns don't really do anything special. Diedrich Bader gives an annoying performance as Joel. Treat Williams and Enrique Murciano just play their roles as much as the screenplay allows it and they don't really do anything special.I think the main reason why this sequel isn't as good as the original is because the premise is nearly the same. They could have been a little more creative with the story. Also the original movie wrapped up nicely and it didn't demand a sequel. So this movie seems like a cash in on a popular film and little time was actually spent on the script. The running time is 115 minutes and this could have been edited. There were a bunch of pointless scenes and the movie just doesn't contain enough fresh material to keep the film funny or interesting. Also the film is very predictable and sitting through a long predictable movie wasn't that much fun. I need to question the point of making a sequel. It seemed like a lazy attempt and the film was only average because of Bullock and King. In the end this unnecessary sequel isn't really worth watching unless you're a fan of Bullock or King. Rating 510".

EVERYTHING was predictable and you knew what would happen the moment the movie startednot like in the first movie which was more inventive and unpredictable to a certain degree.Also I was a bit disappointed with the cast especially Benjamin Bratt not returning. Shatner whom I looked forward to seeing was hardly in itso that was another disappointment. The other actors and actresses were OK. Sandra Bullock was great though and she really held the film together with her comedic attitude. A 10 for her performance! Besides getting some very huge laughs from Diedrich Bader who played Bullock's personal stylistShatner and Sandra Bullock there wasn't much else to offer in the acting department.However I will say most of this movie was hilarious even if it lacked in other things. I definitely recommend seeing it as it will probably be the funniest movie of the year. If you're in the mood to see a very funny laugh a minuteride you should definitely check it out in the theater!

The lead's transformation into a glamor queen just wasn't psychologically or dramatically convincing. There was true talent in this film. Real charisma. But it was lazy.

Not only did Gracie pick up from the last story and run there was a great enhancement with the addition of Regina King as Sam in the story. Gracie and Sam were incredibly different but remarkably alike.Of course bringing back the majority of the original supporting roles  characters was excellent  as well as the tiein to Eric with the tearful telephone breakup.Do not hesitate to see this film for you will be pleased with some great lines and equallygreat physical humor. I believe that Sandra Bullock is developing a physical humor persona in the style of Lucille Ball.Great job Sandra. Now if only you can get your personal life in some sense of order?!".

The guy satin front of us turned around at the end and was like I can tell you enjoyed that we could hear your snorting laugh!!! lol Its got some HILARIOUS moments and some incredibly touching moments verging on tear jerking depending on your mood at the time! some super sweet moments. Sandy was superb Regina was amazing Heather kicks booty hehe... thats part of the movie... you'll get the joke when you've seen it! Will Shatner was... Will... the bad guys were bad.... the ugly guys were ugly... the Bigbird scenes are HILARIOUS and go on for like 30mins.the movie went so quickly at the beginning. Like 30mins into the movie most of the trailer footage is gone and then it moves slower  but still at a good pace! It didn't matter that it wasn't a romcom  it wasn't missing  the movie worked really well without it! Sandy and Regina are so good together  they have some great Kickderiere scenes!!! and play off each other so well.Wardrobe is so good! When sandy's dressed as the old woman that bits so funny!! and there are so many other great costumes to summarise MC2 ... 910 ... there were a few very brief boring moments near the beginning... but it was all building up the story! .... go see it... everyone!!!! Its funnier than the first. More moving than the first.. and just all round a brilliant movie!!".

First of all Sandy looks gorgeous and so damn young she looks older in Murder by numbers. When I got in the theatre my first thought was I pray to god that this is nothing like Speed 2. And it turned out It isn't. This movie has a much depths than the first film. The character of Gracie Hart is so wonderfully portrayed by Bullock that I enjoyed every second of her performance. I'm totally honest in this review so I have to tell you that for me not everything works. So here's my list.What works Sandy is amazing in this thing and highly enjoyable to watch Regina King is a wonderful partner and a great actress Her chemistry together is a wonderful center for the film Dietrich Bader Sandy's stylist is just hilarious The scene with the fake Dolly Parton is one of the funniest I've ever saw they show us much more of Gracies character and motivations than in the first one Enrique Murciano is so damn cute they don't go for cheap jokes except one or twoWhat doesn't work Sometimes there is comedy just because it's a comedy movie and not because the story needs it Heather Burns and William Shattner are less more interesting in the sequel. WARNINGSPOILERThe scene before the last scene is truly heart touching but the very last scene in the classroom is a little bit tacked on. Michael Caine is not in the movieBut all in all it's a damn great enjoyable film with a superb Sandy. Some of the press people had to admit that the film is much better than their expectations. So I hope you liked my review and one big sorry for the mistakes I made in writing this. My English isn't perfect.".

	schema:reviewBody "I always enjoy watching a Sandra Bullock film despite what critics may say about it. Despite a decade and a half in the limelight she is still as fresh and new and as witty and talented as she was when I first noticed her in films like Demolition Man or Speed. Believe me when we watch Bullock we are watching not only a movie star but a movie star who will be remembered long after she she is dead and gone as one of the best.Miss Congeniality 2 was not what I was expecting at all. The billposters and cover art entice us into believing that the beautiful FBI agent Gracie Hart is once more thrown into the backbiting world of an all new beauty pageant but this is not the case.I suppose to recreate the situations of the first movie would have been a mistake anyway so I was pleasantly surprised at the change and am half glad my first expectations were not realised. It is also interesting to note that where Miss Congeniality is by all intents and purposes a RomCom Miss Congeniality 2 is not. There is not even the slightest sniff at a romance so it is safe to say that this is purely ....Com.Gracie due to her televised heroics at the beauty pageant is now too famous for her undercover Field work. Much to her chagrin she is given a new job as the glamorous face of the F.B.I. where she is forced once again to 'doll up' and travel the country in a cavalcade of television shows book signings and guest appearances all to promote the bureau in a positive light.However when her friend the newly crowned Miss United States is kidnapped and held to ransom Gracie is once again chomping at the bit to draw her gun kick some ass and break the rules to rescue her.All this is well and good but when she has a world famous identity a tough new female partner with anger management issues and the entire F.B.I. hampering her every effort Gracie realises that the rescue is going to be a lot harder than she had first thought.This movie is fantastic and very funny. Bullock once again shows us why she is the best female comedy star in the world as she goes from one chaotic scene to the next. One scene that stands out in particular is where she dresses up as an old woman with a large overbite in order to infiltrate an old folks home. Hilarious.Its true that this film is not on par with the original but with all honesty most sequels aren't and I was under no delusions that it was going to be but it is enjoyable and fun all the same.Only two complaints No Micheal Caine. He was hilarious in the first movie and would have been a welcome return to this one. The other complaint is William Shatner.I like William Shatner very much and his hasbeen compare character in the original was a joy to watch throughout but there was no real reason for him to have been in this one at all. Even his lines fail to raise a laugh. He is the only truly redundant character in the movie but to be fair bad characterisation and weak dialogue writing is hardly Shatner's fault is it?On the whole this is good old fashioned comedy executed in a way good old fashioned comedy should be made. Another Bullock beauty.".

When I first heard that Miss Congeniality 2 was coming out I was disappointed because I really liked the original and was afraid that the sequel would ruin it or detract from it. But it didn't I actually enjoyed it and laughed out loud several times. Diedrich Bader does a very good job as Joel Gracie's stylist. I think he'd be my favourite character. It was funny to see Abraham Benrubi as someone other than ER's Jerry. Anyway I digress. All in all it was an enjoyable movie not the best ever and not better than the original but definitely worth seeing. I'd give it 6.5 or 7 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "The reviews of this film have ranged from high praise to intense dislike. Such an extreme range calls for some reflection on how reviewers look at films and how movie lovers may differ in their expectations. Reviewers by and large hate sequels movie lovers by and large flock to see them. This suggests a crucial difference reviewers tend to want something new to reawaken their jaded palettes movie lovers feel comfortable being reintroduced to characters they already know. Many reviewers attacked Miss Congeniality 2 because it seemed to them to be more of the same not something new and exciting. This rule does not hold for Quentin Tarantino movies which seem to be praised for revitalizing old dead conventions mostly by rejecting a sequential narrative by scrambling sets of old clichs from pulp fictions Tarantino we are told revitalizes them though they seem to me to be essentially old clichs still. The question of course is whether the basic premise is valid. The NY Times reviewer who blasted the opening night presentation of Bringing up Baby starring Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant condemned it in much the same terms that are still used for movies that feature both comedy and romance clichd tedious predictable. Audiences however who tend to like happy endings when they go to a comedy have demonstrated their preferences in theaters on TV and on video and DVD. Subsequent critics have ranked Baby as one of the best of the screwball comedies and one of the best romantic comedies ever.Instead of demanding noveltywhich reviewers frequently reject when they find it as in the case of Bullock's Practical Magic which for some reviewers unforgivably mixed love witchcraft and vengeful spirits of the dead making it difficult to classify was it a children's movie? A family movie? A horror flick? a romance? reviewers might do better not to let their expectations freeze out anything on the screen not preprogrammed by the title but to actually think about the movie they are watching. Bullock who participated in what she has declared one of the worst movie sequels ever produced Speed 2 might be expected to be especially shy about being involved in a sequel unless it could do something the first one didn't. I think this one does instead of a romantic comedy it is an action movie with no romantic interest for the star unless it is her initially reluctant partner Sam Fuller a woman Regina King enraged at pretty much everything but especially macho men whom she delights in tossing about the FBI physical combat workout room like dolls who ends up saving her life and becoming her partner no one else will work with either in the same way that Briggs and Murtaugh became an odd couple in the Lethal Weapon series an example Bullock has cited in some interviews. Bullock an ex America's sweetheart presents Gracie as a STAR whose ego is blown up by the adulation she receives as America's newest celebrity when she becomes the PR Face of the FBI. Many reviewers tried to personalize this though the standard litany about the actress is that she is easy to get along with personable helping caring etc. I haven't seen any attempts to blame the movie on her greed perhaps if she hadn't donated a million dollars after 911 and another million after the tsunami that could have been a handy brush with which to tar her and the movie as well. As the references to other celebrities like Dolly Parton Regis and Wayne Newton suggest though critics don't like celebrities the buyers of US People and the tabloids clearly do. Bullock's comment seems to be clear at the end Gracie will write no more books nor offer any more comments all she wants to do is her job. A final theme in the movie seems to arise out of Sam Fuller's propensity for violence a propensity Gracie shares at moments when she isn't being a talk show version of FBI Barbie. Yet at the end of the movie when Gracie threatens a class of elementary school students unless they quiet down it is clear that violence appeals to her at the same time that she wishes it didn't. Miss Congeniality made when Bill Clinton was still President and the greatest threat to government was unrestrained sexual desire ended with Gracie newly crowned as Miss Congeniality insisting that like the other contestants whom she had mocked earlier she really did want world peace. Miss Congeniality 2 made after the invasion of Iraq ends with Gracie looking directly at the audience and affirming that indeed we really do need world peace.I imagine that having to sit through several movies a week could get tedious but I'm not sure this entitles reviewers to rain down their ire on good and bad movies alike. Certainly a little more tentativeness and a bit less certainty about the worth of movies they see only quickly and whose plots they frequently summarize incorrectly might make them less liable to the judgments of those who will be blessed with hindsight and the chance to think about movies before they are required to come to judgment upon them.".

	schema:reviewBody "They say there's nothing new under the sun and that's especially apt in sunny Hollywood.  So it's tempting to ask merely as a theoretical exercise can you make a movie that is essentially a model kit assembled from other movies and still make it effective?  Don't Say a Word proves that the answer is Yes.  WHY you would want to set out to do such a thing is another question you'll have to ask the producers about it.In the movie Michael Douglas plays an affluent happily married psychologist who has to contend as Michael Douglas does in every movie with a seriously disturbed woman.

At one point Douglas makes the kidnappers relocate to meet him a nice twist on the usual kidnappers run the bagman all over town scene.  And the bit with the mental patient well it beats canweraisethemoneyintime?  For his part Michael Douglas does well though he is a little too slick to portray besieged decent men.  My hunch is that Harrison Ford was first choice to play this role.  Famke Janssen is good as his wife.  Though the script gives her little to do she is really the one who makes us feel the panic and despair that attend the abduction of a child and though it's a familiar movie scenario it is still able to play on the nerves quite effectively.  The little girl playing Douglas' daughter does well too cute but not cloying smart but credible there is an amusing scene where she attempts to make conversation with the hulking tattooed murderer who is guarding her eventually cajoling him into making peanutbutter and jelly sandwiches.  And carrying on the proud tradition started by Alyssa Milano in Commando does her level best to foil her captors.The Bad Guys are a little disappointing.  They are assigned quirks rather than characters one never appears to have a name.  As the head villain Sean Bean makes what he can of his feral charisma but he literally phones this performance in.  I think the poor guy is doomed to spend the rest of his career playing Hibernian heavies in leather jackets.  Their operation seems a little too wellorchestrated especially since the movie supposedly take place less than three weeks after they've been sprung after doing a dime in Attica where one guesses they studied electronic eavesdropping in between lifting weights.  And while the movie doesn't say how much the priceless rock is worth by my estimation after splitting the proceeds and covering their overhead surveillance equipment and tattoos the gang should have just enough left for a celebratory lunch at the IHOP.The best performance is by Brittany Murphy as the twitchy wary Elizabeth. With her weird hand gestures and tuneless singing this character could have been really annoying.  But Murphy makes her guileless and affecting. Watching her stare out her barred window at the tugboats in the river your heart breaks just a little.The story is not always credible especially the parts involving Jennifer Esposito as the detective who is really a sideshow anyway.  We also see several New Yorkers who are surprisingly pliant when deprived of everything from cell phones to speedboats.  And the parents adhere blindly to the don't tell the cops rule even after it is laughably impractical to do so.The thing that really makes the movie work is the setting and the way it is shot by director Gary Fleder who made the underrated Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead.  Fleder puts us in claustophobic oppressive places from underground morgues to pukegreen institution hallways with prison doors and disturbing graffiti to the fogshrouded darkness of Potter's Field graveyard of the anonymous dead of New York City.  Even Douglas' luxury apartment seems at tight quarters and these places are filmed in such a way to make this close to a horror movie.  The dark climax is formulaic but give a neat twist in location.  The number incidentally doesn't refer to an uplink code or satellite designation or encryption key or any of the usual millenial McGuffins of late.  What it represents is something surprising sad and refreshingly oldfashioned.  Which kind of goes for the rest of the movie as well.".

So it's tempting to ask merely as a theoretical exercise can you make a movie that is essentially a model kit assembled from other movies and still make it effective?  Don't Say a Word proves that the answer is Yes.  WHY you would want to set out to do such a thing is another question you'll have to ask the producers about it.In the movie Michael Douglas plays an affluent happily married psychologist who has to contend as Michael Douglas does in every movie with a seriously disturbed woman.

I can't quite agree with that but the level of intensity and the fast moving plot really impressed me even if it all didn't quite add up in the end.  I can't remember a movie that I've seen in awhile that just MOVED along so well and had so little downtime. Given the 'deadline' it felt like it was in realtime for the second half of the movie. I was a little bothered by Michael Douglas having a wife the age of Famke. I love her and its not a knock against her but there was no need to keep up Douglas' legacy of attracting wives under 35 for him.  Gwyneth Paltrow Demi Moore and Daryl Hannah have all been love interests for him  why?  Because its the male fantasy?  Reeks of insecurity to me.  Plus I don't see Dame Judi Dench romancing Leo do I?  Meryl Streep and James Franco?  Anyway this is not important just slightly annoying.  There are questions I'd like to ask the screenwriter because there are inconsistencies along the way and about one or two things that are totally out of the question.  However as I mentioned the movie moves along so fast that you might not have time to dwell on anything for too long. I don't think it was speeded up to cover anything up either.  The best part is the acting especially by Brittany Murphy.  I didn't enjoy her in Clueless but really loved her in Girl Interupted and thought she was the best thing about that movie.  Here she gives it all in a part that could have been laughed off the screen if it weren't played exactly right. Jennifer Esposito is also very believable as a cop Sean Bean as a kidnapper and as mentioned Famke as a trophy wife.  Worth watching for sure.  710.".

Murphy seemed so into her character that it was almost spooky to watch her. She was extremely convincing. Douglas I thought also offered up a good performance as did Sean Bean as Patrick the head kidnapper. Young Miss Bartusiak was commendable but to me didn't seem to portray the range of emotions I would expect a young child to be feeling in Jesse's circumstances. She just seemed altogether too calm. The same could be said for Famke Janssen as Jessie's mother Aggie Conrad. I realize the character had a broken leg and apparently couldn't get out of bed but again she just seemed to take the whole thing too calmly and when her own life was threatened she seemed able to move around well enough broken leg or not! As for Oliver Platt as Conrad's colleague Dr. Sachs? I find that depending on the movie I either like Platt or don't no middle ground and I didn't care for him in this movie.Overall though the movie was quite good as a vehicle for Douglas. I'd rate it as a 710.".

And it doesn't really matter.As a side note when is the last time Michael Douglas had an onscreen wife within 20 years of his own age? I mean come on. Do you really think that in real life the man could...oh wait never mind.As for everything else Brittany Murphy scores some points for playing a schizophrenic disaster of a girl who you'd still like to nail. Oliver Platt who is getting fatter faster than Aretha Franklin shows up for some day playerlevel acting work. Famke Jannsen looks sexy in a cast but isn't given much to do. And as for the cop played by Jennifer Esposito she is so irrelevant to the plot that she's practically in a different movie altogether.The plot?

	schema:reviewBody "Highly overdone thriller with a slew of subplots that confuse instead of enhance the story that in the end seems like a big wast of time unless you see it for it's unintentional comedic values.A bank robbery ten years ago in Brooklyn NY to steal an expensive ruby from a safe deposit box goes astray when one of the crooks ends up stealing it from his fellow robbers. A short time later strolling with his eight year old daughter Elisabeth Brittany Murphy on the subway he's chased beaten and thrown to the tracks by the crooks whom he doublecrossed where he's then run over by a train and killed before the eyes of his terrified daughter. Just before Elisabeth's dad is buried in Potter's Field his daughter puts her doll Miska in the Coffin with him not knowing that he hid the sought after ruby in it. Ten years later the crooks who killed her father who were arrested on the scene and sentenced are released from jail. The first thing that they do is go looking for Elisabeth to get the number of the grave that here father is buried in to get a hold of the ruby. Now how does Michael Douglas Dr. Nathan Conrad come in to all this? It seems that Dr. Conrad is a top hot shot psychiatrist who's associated with the mental hospital where Elisabeth is a patient. This is after she recognized one of the crooks who killed her father and went bananas and slashed him to death.The crooks want Dr. Conrad to find out from Elisabeth the number of her fathers grave by him getting her to talk to him. To make sure that Dr. Conrad cooperates they kidnap his eight year old daughter Jessie Skye McCole so that he gets the massage. The movie Don't say a word goes on with at least a dozen more subplots that would take a good size book to explain them all. The final scene in Potter's Field goes on for what seems to be an eternity.Under normal conditions you should have concern and sympathy for Dr. Conrad his wife and daughter as well as young Elisabeth but you just can't. The movie is so contrived that the characters didn't seem real so why even bother to care about them. The most absurd part in the movie with so many absurd parts was the hard as nails all pampered and polished detective Sandra Cassidy Jennifer Esposito. Cassidy in the end of the film takes on the whole batch of hardened criminals singlehandedly without even bothering to call or wait for backup. Even Dirty Harry Callahan wouldn't do that and ends up wiping out almost all of them! even after taking a bullet in her gut! Cassidy is so though that she seems ready to get back on duty the next morning! And to think that there are some people who say that women can't cut it as policemen.".

This is after she recognized one of the crooks who killed her father and went bananas and slashed him to death.The crooks want Dr. Conrad to find out from Elisabeth the number of her fathers grave by him getting her to talk to him. To make sure that Dr. Conrad cooperates they kidnap his eight year old daughter Jessie Skye McCole so that he gets the massage. The movie Don't say a word goes on with at least a dozen more subplots that would take a good size book to explain them all. The final scene in Potter's Field goes on for what seems to be an eternity.Under normal conditions you should have concern and sympathy for Dr. Conrad his wife and daughter as well as young Elisabeth but you just can't. The movie is so contrived that the characters didn't seem real so why even bother to care about them. The most absurd part in the movie with so many absurd parts was the hard as nails all pampered and polished detective Sandra Cassidy Jennifer Esposito. Cassidy in the end of the film takes on the whole batch of hardened criminals singlehandedly without even bothering to call or wait for backup. Even Dirty Harry Callahan wouldn't do that and ends up wiping out almost all of them! even after taking a bullet in her gut! Cassidy is so though that she seems ready to get back on duty the next morning! And to think that there are some people who say that women can't cut it as policemen.";

The plot is daft  every single part of it is silly from the idea of a girl being unreachable is daft the idea of the gang doing this is daft and the way that with very little notice the gang manage to set up cameras everywhere.That said it has it's moments  the opening robbery is good and some of the drama works well.  However for too much of the film you feel like the director is really trying to make it feel more tense than it is  witness the scene where Conrad first finds talks to Patrick Koster on the phone the camera spins wildly all round him.  Similarly he uses a lot of handheld stuff to give the impression of more action than is really happening he also uses other lazy tricks like having everyone shouting their lines at times and making everyone squeal their tyres etc when they drive!  These combined with the silly plot make it hard to get into.Douglas is OK but he doesn't convince as the strong father figure that saves the day  he looks too old to take on Bean in a fight.  He also looks far to old to have a beauty like Famke Janssen.  She does well despite being stuck indoors all the time  the only problem with her is that she is far to warm and perfect a character.  Murphy is good although she has moments where she's too hammy.  Bean and his gang are good but they are distant from the action and never feel like a real threat  in fact you could almost sympathise with Bean having been doublecrossed at the start and wasting 10 years of his life.  Esposito is OK but she doesn't really have a character  she tries to be tough and slightly sassy a role she did so well everyday in Spin City but she comes across as nondescript as her black leather coat. Victor Argo is a pleasure to see but he's wasted here with nothing to do in a really small role.  Fans of Abel Ferrera will know him while he's been in other things notably the two Smoke films and know how good a character actor he can be.Overall this never manages to rise above it's silly plot.

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS  DON'T READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE YET. The current IMDb average rating of 6.5 is a pretty accurate number. The story is simple. A crook Patrick Irishman Sean Bean just out of 10 years in prison needs to find the valuable red jewel that got him there in the first place. The daughter Elisabeth played by Brittany Murphy of the doublecrossing partner he threw in front of the NYC train in 1991 is now 18 the jewel was in her doll which she placed in his casket buried on an island with only an 8digit number identifying the burial plot. Having gone from one hospital to another as a mentally ill child she knows the number but won't tell anyone. So famous child shrink Dr Conrad Michael Douglas is forced to find out in 7 hours on Thanksgiving Day or they will kill his kidnapped daughter Jessie cute talented Houstonian Skye Bartusiak.Put that into a straight story and it wouldn't be too exciting. So we see the 1991 robbery and doublecross at the beginning then the caption says ten years later. We see thugs break into an old woman's apartment no idea why. Dr Conrad gets a 911 call from his associate Oliver Platt. Dr Conrad's daughter shows up missing. Patrick tells Dr Conrad he has to get an 8digit number from the patient by 5PM or his daughter will be killed. They don't give him any idea what the number is supposed to represent no reason other than to create some audience suspense. We don't yet have any idea why she would know the number or what significance it might have.As the film unwinds we see the crooks have set up elaborate surveillance of Conrad's home where his wife Famke Janssen is immobile in a cast from a skiing accident. However near the end she gets on her crutches and puts them to good use battling one crook. Early in the movie we see her scratch her leg under the cast using a long pointed stick which she then stores in her cast. We know it will come into better use later and it does as she shoves it through the heart of the bad guy.Through a series of somewhat improbable actions everyone ends up on the little island at night where all the anonymous graves are. Liz wants to help save Jessie and recalling herself on the ferry 10 years earlier writes the number on a dusty plate of glass. As we watch it looks like she is writing it backwards and when they dig up the grave it's the wrong one. Dr Conrad turns the glass upsidedown they dig up that grave and presto! the doll and the jewel. In a somewhat innovative ending Conrad fights a bad guy a policewoman shows up shots are fired Conrad ends up with the jewel and a gun at Patrick's head throws the jewel into a big pit shored up by wood bracing pushes Patrick into it more shots are fired the pit caves in Patrick is buried everyone else lives happily ever after.A good movie is hard to write especially writing a good ending.  I know I couldn't do it and this author can't either. The whole movie pretty well follows typical Hollywood thriller formulas but it is pretty entertaining anyway especially since the story is told in a way that you don't really know what is going on until the very end. However there is ultimately no good story here nothing to take away or to compare to our experiences. That's why it's rating is between 6 and 7.The acting is uniformly good and this role is the kind Michael Douglas has played in most of his movies. The real star is Brittany Murphy as Elisabeth. She is nothing short of awardcaliber. The DVD extras are among the best if you enjoy aspects of filmmaking. There are several behindthescenes extras that take you through various phases of making this film. Also included is the original screen test of Brittany Murphy and it is hard to believe how fully she put herself into the character.  This is a case where many will find the DVD extras actually more interesting than the film itself. The sound is selectable to either DTS or Dolby Digital. I listened to the DTS track and it is welldone indeed.".

The whole movie pretty well follows typical Hollywood thriller formulas but it is pretty entertaining anyway especially since the story is told in a way that you don't really know what is going on until the very end. However there is ultimately no good story here nothing to take away or to compare to our experiences. That's why it's rating is between 6 and 7.The acting is uniformly good and this role is the kind Michael Douglas has played in most of his movies. The real star is Brittany Murphy as Elisabeth. She is nothing short of awardcaliber. The DVD extras are among the best if you enjoy aspects of filmmaking. There are several behindthescenes extras that take you through various phases of making this film. Also included is the original screen test of Brittany Murphy and it is hard to believe how fully she put herself into the character.  This is a case where many will find the DVD extras actually more interesting than the film itself. The sound is selectable to either DTS or Dolby Digital. I listened to the DTS track and it is welldone indeed.";

	schema:reviewBody "This thriller certainly is a good enough one to watch and it also is a very professionally made one but it however offers very little new or refreshing enough material. It makes Don't Say a Word nothing more than a standard thriller with some good actors in it.The cast is really the saving grace of the movie. It still provides the movie with some good moments and characters and also give the movie an extra sense of professionalism involved. Sean Bean is a great as the main villain and delivers an absolute fine performance. Michael Douglas is also great as the leading man mainly because he doesn't play him as an 'hero' but an ordinary everyday person instead. Douglas is always fine in these sort of roles. Some other excellent actors play some smaller parts in the movie. Actors such as Brittany Murphy Oliver Platt Victor Argo and last but not least Famke Janssen. They all help to make the movie look better and more interesting than it in fact really is. Most of the characters are however pretty flat. Why does Famke Janssen even play the wife? It's a role basically every actress could had played. This movie just didn't seem like a very challenging or original project to get involved with. And I also have the feeling that the movie would had been better of without the Jennifer Esposito. Just think about it was she really necessary for the movie and its story? Her character is not engaging enough since it's not she we need to care about or cheer for but the Michael Douglas character instead who is the main lead of the movie. Her character is distracting from the movie its main story.The movie is certainly stylefull and it does have its moments. But in the end it just really falls flat as a really good or original thriller. All of the moments in the movie are just too predictable and the movie doesn't offer any real surprises. Therefor this movie just isn't anymore than a well made but standard formulaic thriller.It's a movie that does serve its purpose and the movie certainly is watchable as a simple standard thriller. Fans of the genre will probably still be the most entertained by it but even they have to conclude that this movie is far from being one of the best thrillers released in recent years. It's the sort of movie that is only quite good enough to watch it just maybe once. Don't expect too much of this and you might end up liking it good enough.Nothing too remarkable just a well made simple thriller with some great actors in it.610httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

But those two songs Marvin Gaye  Pride and Joy and Louis Prima  Fee Fie Foo. These songs got so into me. And afterall the jazz adds more of this New York feeling to me.The other day when I watched it it was cloudy and not very good whether. This movie fit very nicely into that evening.About the acting part. I'm not very good at judging people's acting but I do recognize when somebody acts bad. Not in this movie though. Everything was great. Sean Bean is very good at playing bad guys. Skye McCole Bartusiak did also a nice job.This movie rocks in every way.".

A political backdrop is either entirely absent or implicit in the other examples of the genre I've mentioned but Chaplin makes it explicit and some might say that to some extent this unbalances the last reel of an otherwise utterly brilliant film. Others perhaps will be more sympathetic to the historical context. For me while completely supporting Chaplin's observations concerning the business of war the heavy underlining of his message does seem a flaw when viewing the film today.All the same Monsieur Verdoux is a magnificent achievement not least in its wonderful gallery of characters many played by character actors rarely seen on screen. Two in particular stand out both playing wives of the muchmarried Verdoux dour unsmiling Margaret Hoffman who goes to her death in an extraordinary scene of darkness followed by sudden light and Martha Raye in her best cinematic role as the wife Verdoux fails to kill. Raye is such an explosion of energy and personality that the screen can barely contain her. To watch her and Chaplin in their scenes together is sheer joy.The script is witty the photography excellent and Chaplin's penchant for sentimentality is held well in check.

Chaplin softened his character by making him a lifelong bank clerk who was laid off at the age when it was already too late to start life anew meanwhile he has a family to support a small son and an invalid wife. He's caught and put to trial where he accuses a hypocritical society of sanctioned mass murders and describes himself as an amateur in the field. Originally the idea belonged to Orson Welles who wanted to make a movie based on the story of a notorious murderer Henri Landru a Frenchman who was executed in 1922 for murdering 8 women. Welles asked Chaplin to star in his film but the latter refused as he thought it was too late for him to play in a movie directed by someone else. But he bought the original idea from Welles and made what could have been a detective story or a thriller into a black comedy. It was certainly provocative and its sarcastic and ironic gravity was astonishing for the time. There is a scene for instance when Verdoux while waiting for the execution talks to a journalist and pronounces the words that still fill me with horror as they are as true nowadays as they had been fifty years agoWars conflicts  it's all business. One murder makes a villain millions a hero. Numbers sanctify. Yet Monsieur Verdoux which is generally known as the most pessimistic of Chaplin films is not devoided of humour.

	schema:headline " a black comedy of manners stunning performance from Chaplin";
	schema:reviewBody "It would be hard to imagine anyone else playing Monsieur Verdoux Charlie Chaplin was the only one who could pull it off in any form or style or way that wouldn't make the character as just an unlikeable killer of women. As it's written on the page the character if played by someone with less charisma or charm or comic timing would just be another character actor playing a villain. But Chaplin taking the part is inspired on his part and it's a good thing too and I never thought I'd say this that he didn't let Orson Welles direct. With Welles it obviously would have been a visually awesome picture but would the comedy be the same? Or the emphasis on the social message blending in with the ultimate sanctimonious attitude of the character? It would be interesting to see Welles script if it exists but as it stands he's mostly a footnote in his tale if a thankful one.Under Chaplin's direction and writing Monsieur Verdoux is timed with finesse and glee and with a repetitive transition of the train going by quickly with Chaplin's piano key strokes and it's often devilish fun to hear how Chaplin's Verdoux gets around and about or sometimes not killing and robbing his victims. And yet I'm inclined to say that it's above all else a triumph for Chaplin as an actor a performer who's iconic appeal even past the Tramp character makes us or at least me almost cheer him on or feel awkward or cringing during a scene leading up to a murder or as does happen once or twice not. He knows how to put on an air that's genuine even as it's the most blatant con and he does it with a gentleman's manner hiding his desperatetimescallfordesperatemeasures exbank clerk. While I wouldn't go as far as James Agee in calling it the greatest male performance ever it might just be my favorite Chaplin performance full of ranging subtleties and overthetop expressions and just lingering looks of contempt and malaise and sorrow and outright lying and etc that are just a knockout.Monsier Verdoux is a peculiar character as his crimes are meant to be for the good of his wife and child who of course have no idea of what he's really doing in an acidic touch his wife is also crippled. Is it wrong what he's doing? In the legal sense of course. But Chaplin sets up a moral code for this character that makes things trickier a little warped in thinking. If the woman has lots of wealth stored away and maybe as with the one who keeps getting away via wine glass and fishing trip almost deserving in the perception of the character why carp? But then there's the woman who's just out of prison her husband's gone nothing to her name and... he just can't bear to do her in especially as should be noted as a test run for another victim. It becomes curious to see her later on sort of as the notquite Chaplin heroine of the story and how saving the right one for Verdoux is what counts despite forgetting her until she reappears.So there's this twisted logic but in the setpieces that Chaplin sets up are some of the finest most brilliantly timed comic moments of his career filmed for a dark suspense tinged with a near sweetness that we know and love from him. It's satire on a level that is no more or less sophisticated than Chaplin's major silent works and yet it's just a little sharper more pointed at the ills of man in turmoil than a simple psychopath all in the realm of delightful crimes in the upper class. While the end may seem derivative of the Great Dictator with a speech and message chocked forward like spraypaint on a wall it's a mixed reaction one might have the sanctimonious attitude of being accepting and pointing the finger back on society is haunting and obvious and also importantly speaks to the nature of the character. Would a man somewhat comfortable in his own mortality face the end any other way?".

As it's written on the page the character if played by someone with less charisma or charm or comic timing would just be another character actor playing a villain. But Chaplin taking the part is inspired on his part and it's a good thing too and I never thought I'd say this that he didn't let Orson Welles direct. With Welles it obviously would have been a visually awesome picture but would the comedy be the same? Or the emphasis on the social message blending in with the ultimate sanctimonious attitude of the character? It would be interesting to see Welles script if it exists but as it stands he's mostly a footnote in his tale if a thankful one.Under Chaplin's direction and writing Monsieur Verdoux is timed with finesse and glee and with a repetitive transition of the train going by quickly with Chaplin's piano key strokes and it's often devilish fun to hear how Chaplin's Verdoux gets around and about or sometimes not killing and robbing his victims. And yet I'm inclined to say that it's above all else a triumph for Chaplin as an actor a performer who's iconic appeal even past the Tramp character makes us or at least me almost cheer him on or feel awkward or cringing during a scene leading up to a murder or as does happen once or twice not. He knows how to put on an air that's genuine even as it's the most blatant con and he does it with a gentleman's manner hiding his desperatetimescallfordesperatemeasures exbank clerk. While I wouldn't go as far as James Agee in calling it the greatest male performance ever it might just be my favorite Chaplin performance full of ranging subtleties and overthetop expressions and just lingering looks of contempt and malaise and sorrow and outright lying and etc that are just a knockout.Monsier Verdoux is a peculiar character as his crimes are meant to be for the good of his wife and child who of course have no idea of what he's really doing in an acidic touch his wife is also crippled. Is it wrong what he's doing? In the legal sense of course. But Chaplin sets up a moral code for this character that makes things trickier a little warped in thinking. If the woman has lots of wealth stored away and maybe as with the one who keeps getting away via wine glass and fishing trip almost deserving in the perception of the character why carp? But then there's the woman who's just out of prison her husband's gone nothing to her name and... he just can't bear to do her in especially as should be noted as a test run for another victim. It becomes curious to see her later on sort of as the notquite Chaplin heroine of the story and how saving the right one for Verdoux is what counts despite forgetting her until she reappears.So there's this twisted logic but in the setpieces that Chaplin sets up are some of the finest most brilliantly timed comic moments of his career filmed for a dark suspense tinged with a near sweetness that we know and love from him. It's satire on a level that is no more or less sophisticated than Chaplin's major silent works and yet it's just a little sharper more pointed at the ills of man in turmoil than a simple psychopath all in the realm of delightful crimes in the upper class. While the end may seem derivative of the Great Dictator with a speech and message chocked forward like spraypaint on a wall it's a mixed reaction one might have the sanctimonious attitude of being accepting and pointing the finger back on society is haunting and obvious and also importantly speaks to the nature of the character. Would a man somewhat comfortable in his own mortality face the end any other way?";

	schema:reviewBody "Charlie Chaplin is Monsieur Verdoux in this 1947 film based on the reallife serial killer Henri Landru. Verdoux is a bank clerk who is laid off late in life and turns to marrying and killing women for their money in order to support his invalid wife and child. Sounds brutal and when you think about it it really is but Chaplin as usual manages to couch his message in comedy. While we see that he is successful in knocking off a couple of women and getting their money though we never actually see a murder Verdoux has a couple of failures as well and there the fun begins. One of his women Annabella Bonheur is played hysterically by Martha Raye as a vulgar loudmouth eternally suspicious of Verdoux who is posing as a boat captain. He tries some different ways of killing her but no matter what he does nothing works. He then turns his attention to another woman he's been chasing for some time Marie Grosnay Isobel Elsom. He's about to walk down the aisle when who does he see as a guest at the wedding  Annabelle. His attempts to get out of the house are priceless.Despite some genuinely comical scenes the speech that Verdoux makes gives its deeper message  Verdoux was in it for the money. To him the women were business propositions to be exploited. His point is that what he has done on a smaller scale is being done by dictators worldwide people are not treated as human beings but merely for economic gain for power and for exploitation. Though Verdoux's argument doesn't absolve him of responsibility or justify his actions the warning is a good one  people need to care more about each other and about what's going on in their world and put their attention on really important matters like suppression of the masses. Why he asks are the headlines full of Verdoux and not of what is going on around the world? The film's ending takes place in 1937. It's interesting to consider what would have happened to this story in the hands of Orson Welles whose idea it was originally. He wouldn't have made it a comedy. It would have been a drama or a detective story. Only Chaplin would think of making the story of a serial killer into a comedy of sorts. Certainly 1967's No Way to Treat a Lady takes a page or so from this script.Monsieur Verdoux wasn't well received by the public  at all  and by 1947 people were questioning Chaplin's politics instead of reveling in his genius. It possibly was ahead of its time it certainly wasn't appreciated as it is today. The movie is not without some problems the biggest one being what the heck happened to Verdoux's wife and child? It is never explained.Wars conflicts  it's all business. One murder makes a villain millions a hero. Numbers sanctify. Charlie Chaplin as Verdoux said that 61 years ago.".

First and foremost it is a pleasure to hear Charlie talk.  I also venture to say this is the best of his soundera films wellmounted and shot meticulously in black and white in which he not only produced and directed but provided the music.  Who but the loveable Chaplin with that everpresent tinge of pathos could play the role of a methodical unrepentant human wifedisposal who kills purely for financial reward and have the audience rooting for him!Our titular hero is a charming fop of a fellow who operates his deadly deception by a precise timetable  he fastidiously charms marries and eliminates his unsuspecting victims with keen attention paid to banker's hours!   But it's Monsieur Verdoux's motive that gains the viewer's empathy. Our boy is not the mad demented twisted coldhearted monster one must think.  He carries out his dastardly deeds out of selfless need.  His outoftown business is conducted solely in order to support and tend to his wheelchairbound wife a hopeless cripple and invalid and family. His devotion in fact is so honorable he succeeds in wrapping you around his little wedding finger.  As much as you sympathize for the dowagers he does in you can't help but think at least the old dears died having been graced by such a noble gentleman.Brash loudster Martha Raye often considered a bust in films for being intolerably largerthanlife has one of her best roles here grabbing her share of laughs as one of Verdoux's intended victims  a shrill obnoxious but verrrry wealthy dame whom nobody would really mind seeing knocked off. The problem is Charlie can't seem to off her!   Every industrious attempt fails miserably.  In one truly madcap scene that directly parodies Theodore Dreiser's classic novel An American Tragedy Charlie takes Martha outlandishly bedecked in silver fox furs out on a crude fishing boat excursion in the hopes of drowning the tenacious harridan.  Two comic masters in vintage form.Of course Charlie does get his comeuppance but its all done in grand sophisticated style.  The whole movie is in fact so precise and polished that one must forgive him given his controversial subversive leanings at the time for tacking on an interminable outofcharacter piece of political diatribe at the finishing line.  The movie's theme and bitter irony  did not even pretend to disguise his great personal anguish and bitterness at America when political conservatives were breathing down his neck.  Forgiven he is for this black comedy a sublime eloquent retread of an old familiar creeper comes off refreshingly original.".

All his polished charm and oily flattery just slide by her obnoxious silliness. Raye makes a perfect foil and an inspired piece of casting.Of course some of the beguiling Little Tramp remains in Verdoux's character as when he befriends the penniless girl Nash or in that supremely ironic moment when he ambles Trampstyle toward the guillotine. All in all it's a strange little movie that was apparently shelved for years for obvious reasons. Nonetheless it was rather gutsy for Chaplin to take such chances with his established character and at Cold War's outset.

But it's an uncomfortable one and Chaplin proves unable to stay metaphorically seated for any amount of time.The film depicts an outofwork banker's unique way of obtaining income to support his wife  child he fraudulently marries wealthy widows and murders them. The film is maddeningly episodic in that once he finds a few widows that compromise his plans most notably by continually coming into contact with one another the film just sort of bounces back and forth between the bland and forgettable Marie Grosnay Isobel Elsom and the spectacularly annoying Annabella Bonheur Martha Raye. The film never truly achieves anything resembling an interest level until its final reels which are at least sort of intriguing making a satirical query of why when men order wars that kill hundreds of thousands they are heroes but one man kills a small amount he is severely punished. The sequence is a jarring switch in tone from the previous 90 minutes but at least it's interesting.The other problem is that his character and thus the film has no bite to it. Where Arsenic was all about the clash of overplaying and underplaying and Kind Hearts made me cackle malicious Verdoux is very matteroffact and workmanlike completely to its detriment. Just because the acts are hohum to its character should not mean they are to its audience.And that's the problem with the film as a whole it never gets up enough energy and invention to distinguish it from similar contemporary and above all far BETTER films. From its comedy to its macabre to its romance to its setpieces everything feels overly familiar and done with less verve and ultimately less interest.Grade 510 C  13 of 13 of 1947".

	schema:reviewBody "Charles Chaplin's blackest comedy by far 'Monsieur Verdoux' was released seven years after the phenomenal success of 'The Great Dictator' to considerable controversy. How after all could the legendary actor and director who brought us The Tramp have suddenly set his sights on playing a serial wifemurderer? Originally conceived by Orson Welles  who had envisioned a film about reallife Bluebeard and serial killer Henri Dsir Landru  Chaplin purchased the idea for 5000 and fashioned it into the darkest of dark comedies. Interwoven into this farcical comedy of murders is a tragic portrayal of the effect of the Great Depression on struggling families and Chaplin's own indictment of wartime conflict.Chaplin leaves us in no doubt that had it not been for the devastating recession of 1930 Henri Verdoux would never have acquired his wifekilling tendencies. A bank clerk for over thirty years Verdoux Chaplin lost his job at the first signs of economic trouble. In order to sustain his disabled wife Mady Correll and young son both of whom he loves dearly Verdoux turns to charming lonely old women marrying them within a few weeks murdering them and escaping with their savings leaving barely a trace for detectives to follow.Despite the dark subject matter the film is itself a critique of violence and warfare. When finally brought before the court to plead his defence Verdoux delicately labels himself a minor hero satirising America's apparent fascination then and now with developing more advanced and devastating weapons of mass destruction. It's just business. That's the history of many a big business. Wars conflict it's all business. One murder makes a villain millions a hero. Numbers sanctify my good fellow. The film ends with one of the bleakest images of any comedy as Henri Verdoux is led slowly towards the guillotine to be executed.Though Chaplin certainly doesn't condone Verdoux's actions we are invited to sympathise fully with his plight and our inclination to see him succeed subtly implies that we ourselves are somehow complicit in the crime. In his Notes for Verdoux Chaplin wrote it is more important to understand crime than to condemn it. 'Monsieur Verdoux' was produced during a difficult time in Chaplin's life. After America entered World War Two Chaplin expressed his favour for an alliance with the Soviet Union leading him to be branded a Communist or a Communist sympathiser. Due to Chaplin's dwindling popularity the film was boycotted in a number of states and was his first commercial flop in decades though it fared better in Europe. Chaplin wrote of the film I lent my characters my own embittered reflections. When there are no facts sentiments prevail.My description thus far has made the film itself sound awfully depressing and thoroughly unentertaining but the opposite is actually true. Though Chaplin abandons the comedy in the final few minutes in order to drive home his message much as he did with the Jewish barber's speech in 'The Great Dictator' 'Monsieur Verdoux' certainly contains his trademark slapstick comedy in great abundance. His character's antics may be a little less wellintentioned than those of The Tramp but we can only laugh as Verdoux attempts vainly to assassinate his latest wife Annabella Martha Raye  first by poisoning her wine with a tasteless traceless mixture he concocted and then by trying to drown her whilst rowing across an isolated lake in a small rowboat. From beginning to end 'Monsieur Verdoux' proves that in 1947 Charles Chaplin was still at the top of his game.".

	schema:headline " Far from the Little Tramp";
	schema:reviewBody "As Charlie Chaplin put it when the tramp finally talked in The Great Dictator the magic was gone. Chaplin felt he had to come up with another character in order to continue his career and he got away from the lovable Little Tramp as far as he could with Monsieur Verdoux.A whole lot of people were shocked when Monsieur Verdoux came out and instead of the Tramp we got a Bluebeard murderer. Black comedy was not a genre popular in the USA at that time and a lot of people hated this film. None more so than Hollywood columnist Hedda Hopper who as a good conservative Republican cheered on the coming blacklist and beat the drums for Chaplin's deportation. No accident that Chaplin was hauled before the House UnAmerican Activities Committee at the time Monsieur Verdoux came out.Based on the famous French mass criminal Henry Desire Landru Monsieur Verdoux tells the story of a bank clerk who lost his job and to support his family started marrying and murdering rich women. Verdoux keeps quite a schedule because he's marrying several of them at the same time. But always returns to wife Mady Correll and son Allison Roddan.Funniest marriage is to Martha Raye who not only is he unsuccessful in killing she nearly does him in on a couple of occasions strictly by accident. That raucous laugh might elicit sympathy from a jury if anyone ever heard it and was condemned to live with it even part time.With the marriage to Raye comes the film's funniest sequence Chaplin trying to kill Raye when they were in a boat on a lake in Switzerland. It will not escape your attention that the sequence is borrowed from Theodore Dreiser's An American Tragedy which was already filmed in 1931 and would shortly be filmed again in 1951 as A Place In The Sun. Ironic indeed how the same plot gambits can be played for laughs or deadly serious.Second funniest is Raye showing up at Chaplin's wedding to Isobel Elsom whom he has targeted. It forces him to leave her at the altar not knowing at that time how lucky she was.Truth be told some of Chaplin's left wing political views are grafted into the film somewhat forcibly. It's what got Hedda Hopper's undergarments in such a twist. Still this an amusing film and not fairly judged by a lot of people at the time it came out.".

	schema:reviewBody "With the exception of a handful of early shorts Charlie Chaplin took responsibility for every possible aspect of his creative process not only starring in his pictures but also writing producing directing editing and even scoring them himself. In the silent era this worked very well because he was a master at the comical ballet of slapstick. When sound arrived however he found himself struggling with verbal comedy and the inelegance of dialogue.Monsieur Verdoux is a comedy of murders developed from an idea by Orson Welles. It's a decent little story with a dark theme for both Welles and Chaplin but one they have melded to a more humanist end. In adapting Welles's outline Chaplin shows his flair for creating intriguing characters making his hero a murderer who will rescue a caterpillar from being stepped upon and is filled with love for his wheelchairbound true wife and their young son. As with Chaplin's other talking pictures the biggest problem in the screenplay is his trite dialogue peppered with a touch of the awkward such as the son in the first scene describing his mother or sister it's not entirely clear as having feet like submarines.In his earlier movies Chaplin's style as a director tended towards simplicity eschewing closeups and camera moves for long static takes for the action to unfold in. Now perhaps in an attempt to appear modern he is being a bit more adventurous with the camera but it appears clunky and misguided. Luckily Chaplin still has his eye for beautiful iconic moments. His murder of one wife disappearing into a room offscreen as the sunset shines through an upstairs window combines the sinisterness of Hitchcock with the grace of Griffith. In another quite lovely moment he uses a flower shop telephone to call a wouldbe wife but in the foreground we see the overwhelmed reaction of a young florist utterly convinced of his sincerity.Chaplin remains in attempt at least a slapstick comic and he tries here and there to grease the narrative of Monsieur Verdoux with a bit of physical comedy. It bears some resemblance to his silent work but is always accompanied by verbal commentary from the characters which makes it seem flat almost mechanical. This is something Chaplin himself feared when the talkies first arrived but nevertheless he ploughs on with forced routines that seem at odds with the film world going on around them. At least the star himself is still good enough able to slide from cheeky and comical to stern and serious with ease and credibility.I think the unfortunate truth is that with the added complications of sound the entire process of making a movie was beyond Chaplin's capabilities. If only he had had the humility to allow someone else to cowrite with him and come up with some decent dialogue or handed over directing duties to someone who could better reconcile the comedy and drama. Essentially Monsieur Verdoux is still a very good movie  Chaplin's genius is still tucked away in there  but it lacks the overall brilliance of his earlier works.".

	schema:headline " I Think Than Henri Desire Landru Would Have Approved";
	schema:reviewBody "There is a constant effort by the fans of Orson Welles to pinpoint films of importance that he had a hand in even if he did not appear in them or direct them. The two most notable ones are AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS which was based on a 1946 Broadway musical flop that Welles directed and starred in and MONSIEUR VERDOUX. The former had a score a bad one by Cole Porter and elaborate sets and tricks  and folded after a few months plunging Welles into bankruptcy. He had to live in Europe afterward due to tax problems. Welles sold his interest in the musical to his producer Mike Todd. And Todd turned around and made his one great film out of AROUND THE WORLD in 1955 without even offering Welles a cameo in it. In 194546 Welles also sold a screenplay and idea for a movie about the career of the French Bluebeard murderer Landru to Charlie Chaplin. Chaplin would have been directed by Welles but instead ended up doing the film himself  and only remembering on giving Welles any credit when Welles pointedly reminded him about it. This was MONSIEUR VERDOUX.Henri Desire Landru was a criminal and second hand furniture dealer. He was married legitimately and from most accounts was a good husband except for having a mistress and a good father. But starting in 1917 Landru began romancing a series of middle aged women he met through the matrimonial columns of Paris newspapers sweeping them off their feet and then marrying them. He used several country locations most infamously a nice looking country villa at the town Gambais to take his brides for disposal he would take them to the villa kill them probably by poison or strangulation and then burn their bodies in a large stovefireplace in the house. He may have chosen the villa too because it was near a convenient cemetery  a perfect place to hide corpse remains like bones.From 1917 to 1919 Landru as best the authorities figured out married 12 women and killed them and the son of one of them. He was caught when members of several of the families went to the police about the sudden disappearances of these ladies and one of the families ran across Landru and tipped off the police. In arresting him they found he had a remarkably exact accounting system regarding the expense of each marriage including the cost of tickets to Gambais significantly two tickets going but only one coming back. His trial in 1922 was an international event and he did not disappoint. An exceptionally clever and even witty man he actually made the court laugh frequently until the evidence of mass murder became too evident. He was convicted and guillotined.Henri Landru was bald headed and wore a spade beard. Charlie Chaplin as Landru's screen clone Henri Verdoux has white hair a fancy little mustache and wears butterfly collars and homburg hats. He is a total dandy  and quite the charmer. He also is able to thrown himself into each different personality and role he plays as the husbands of the various victims. In actual fact he is a bank teller who lost his job  and had a crippled wife and sickly child to take care of. He pretends to be among other things a furniture dealer a retired sea captain an expert on jewelry he does show some knowledge of jewelry with one of his wives and several other types of professionals.Chaplin wisely made most of the women Verdoux romances pretty obnoxious. But he is defeated by one of them  Annabella Martha Raye in arguably her greatest comic role. Annabella is a wealthy ex  theater person who has a zest for life is fairly guileless she is cheated by two old friends at one point and has some gross physical habits that disgust the fastidious Henri. But every time he tries to kill her including a hysterical attempt at drowning her in a rowboat he gets injured or frustrated. She and only one other one of his wouldbe victims escape his murder plans.So does a young woman Marilyn Nash whom Landru picks up one night to experiment with using a new poison. But the young woman is so full of promise and shares some of his ideas that he lets her live. Later she will be the last woman he shares a good evening with but by then she has become the mistress of an arms manufacturer.Chaplin used the film to rip apart the hypocrisy of modern life  we condemn the Landrus and George Joseph Smiths and Al Capones who use murder for money purposes but we have a society that insists that building large armed forces are good ideas that rewards arms manufacturers and perverted scientists making weapons with money and glory. Made after two world wars shattered Europe and after the Great Depression showed the emptiness of greed MONSIEUR VERDOUX indicted modern society as nothing else in Chaplin's work had ever done before. It is the most hopeless of his greatest films  for it ends with it's hero going to his doom and welcoming that doom. For Verdoux knows that unless society can change and he doubts it will we will all be following him soon.".

Annabella is a wealthy ex  theater person who has a zest for life is fairly guileless she is cheated by two old friends at one point and has some gross physical habits that disgust the fastidious Henri. But every time he tries to kill her including a hysterical attempt at drowning her in a rowboat he gets injured or frustrated. She and only one other one of his wouldbe victims escape his murder plans.So does a young woman Marilyn Nash whom Landru picks up one night to experiment with using a new poison. But the young woman is so full of promise and shares some of his ideas that he lets her live. Later she will be the last woman he shares a good evening with but by then she has become the mistress of an arms manufacturer.Chaplin used the film to rip apart the hypocrisy of modern life  we condemn the Landrus and George Joseph Smiths and Al Capones who use murder for money purposes but we have a society that insists that building large armed forces are good ideas that rewards arms manufacturers and perverted scientists making weapons with money and glory. Made after two world wars shattered Europe and after the Great Depression showed the emptiness of greed MONSIEUR VERDOUX indicted modern society as nothing else in Chaplin's work had ever done before. It is the most hopeless of his greatest films  for it ends with it's hero going to his doom and welcoming that doom. For Verdoux knows that unless society can change and he doubts it will we will all be following him soon.";

Nope. Instead he was a horrible but extremely glib and wellmannered serial killer! The Little Tramp was definitely dead and buried! I liked the blackness of this comedy very much but I also found that the longer I watched it the less I enjoyed the film. Now it didn't become BADnot in the least. Instead it just started to drag and this is one of the few movies I've recently seen that probably should have been significantly shorter. But because the movie dragged we are treated to longwinded speeches by Verdoux about the awfulness of the human raceprobably mirroring Chaplin's own distaste for life following his fall from grace after fallout concerning his Socialist leanings AND affairs with underage women. If the film had just ended 20 or 30 minutes earlier we would have been spared thisplus ending the movie with Verdoux being guillotined isn't exactly a great ending eitherthere's just nothing humorous about that! Maybe having him get away with the murders or being murdered himself by one of his many wives who herself turned out to be a serial killerthat would have been a much better way to wrap up the movie.I would like to add a few comments about the technical aspects of the film. Once again Chaplin starred produced directed wrote and did the musical score for the film. An amazing accomplishment indeed. The music while decent is very reminiscent of the music from LIMELIGHT mad a few years later but not quite as refined. Everything else was topnotch.Finally while I have never been a particular fan of Martha Raye she was great in the film. That's because of all the MANY wives of Verdoux I kept rooting for him to kill her!! She was AWFUL and really ANNOYINGso much so that it really added to the film because you found yourself wanting her to be murdered! Now THAT'S an interesting little twist.".

	schema:reviewBody "A prissy bank clerk is made redundant during the Depression and turns to courting and murdering spinsters and widows for their money.Apparently Orson Welles suggested the idea of this film to Chaplin and may even have outlined the story.  The screenplay is Chaplin's own and contains his characteristic shortcomings. He also directed the film and composed the music quite apart from starring in it.  His achievement is considerable but the film's weaknesses are also very much attributable to him.A preliminary point needs to be made.  Chaplin is irredeemably oldfashioned.  This film was made in 1947 the year of modernspirited films like Brighton Rock and Germania Anno Zero.  Yet here is Chaplin in what is essentially a silent movie with sound.  Caption cards say things like A small villa somewhere in the south of France.  The settings are very stagey and static being a succession of boxy theatrical sets linked by establishing shots sometimes poorquality archive film.  Chaplin ventures out on location only once  in the boating scene near the end.  The humour belongs back in the silent era too  as when Verdoux's pianoplaying is interrupted by the knocking of Louise the maid on the window or Verdoux swats an imaginary bee and falls through the window.The film is outmoded not just in the way it's put together but in its 'feel'.  The blocking of the actors is stodgy and static and the acting is hammy.  Chaplin plays Verdoux as a stereotype Frenchman with beret imperiale moustache and artist's smock.  He even says Oh la la.  Chaplin worked in Paris during the bel epoque and in Monsieur Verdoux he is psychologically fixed in that earlier era.The plot creaks dreadfully.  We start with the Couvais family railing against the absent Verdoux.  They lay down plot points in the crudest fashion saying things like Look what he's done already and enumerating Verdoux's ploys.  Verdoux's intentions regarding Mme. Grosnay are tediously predictable and horribly longwinded.  On a cafe terrace in Paris Verdoux meets a former banking colleague then takes his leave immediately.  This clumsily contrived scene happens so that the banker can tell another man and therefore the viewer about Verdoux's past.  Verdoux gives the viewer information about his plans via the unsubtle device of thinking aloud. There are enough ludicrously convenient coincidences to make even ardent Chaplin fans cringe.  His neighbour in the country just happens to be a talkative pharmacist who has been conducting experiments into an untraceable poison.  The Belgian girl a pretty but wooden Marilyn Nash is released from prison on the exact same day as Verdoux needs a rootless derelict on whom to test his poison.  The jailbird just happens to have with her a copy of Schopenhauer leading to a discussion of his treatise on suicide.  She just happens to have an invalid husband the only thing that could soften Verdoux's heart because he too just happens to have a disabled spouse. Annabella is saved from murder by the arrival of a ridiculous band of unseen yodellers at the boating lake.  And when Verdoux finally arranges a wedding with Mme Grosnay Annabella just happens to be a wedding guest.The film is annoying in other ways.  Chaplin insists on giving Verdoux the behavioural tic of pursing his lips effeminately.  This wears thin after a few seconds but we have to endure it for two hours which is about twice as long as this movie needed to be.  When Verdoux strolls along Parisian boulevards people are sporting the fashions of 1947 even though Verdoux was guilloutined ten years before this.  Chaplin cannot resist a cliche cancan scene and stages it badly with the girls performing at the same time as the customers are dancing with one another.  Once he has prepared his poison wine Verdoux suddenly and inexplicably speaks directly to the camera  And now for the experiment!  This is a flagrant breach of the film's conventions to no good effect.  On the second meeting with the Belgian girl Verdoux is cold towards her for no discernible reason.  The sidestep which allows Verdoux to lock his pursuers in the broom closet is plain silly.  The avoidance of Annabella at the wedding is an example of Chaplin's tendency to stretch a weak joke to maddening lengths of obviousness.  And of course Chaplin just has to fulminate against Hitler and Mussolini even though the Second World War had finished two years earlier.Chaplin didn't know what he wanted to do with Verdoux.  The black comedy elements are never strong and Chaplin being Chaplin he cannot resist big 'dramatic' scenes like the death of Lydia and the walk to the scaffold.  The final proposition  that Verdoux is a nice guy compared to the Nazis  is an insult to the viewer.  Verdoux is an ogre but Chaplin is pulled as always towards maudlin sentimentality.In his final speech from the dock Verdoux opines that ... to be successful in anything one must be wellorganised.  It is a shame that Chaplin didn't heed his own advice.  The film is subtitled A Comedy Of Murders.  Perhaps it should have read The Murder Of Comedy.".

	schema:reviewBody "For this one Chaplin mostly ditched his old slapstick antics and went for more of a dark cynical tone. That idea really works out well in the first half because it's just really intriguing to watch Chaplin play a coldblooded killer. It's just so out of the ordinary. Sadly the movie starts dragging from then on because the pace is so slow and there is virtually no variation in the scenes. Every scene is Chaplin courting women and occasionally trying to kill them. Also he gets in some funny situations that are not really very funny. Especially the wedding scene goes on for way too long and seems really out of place. Perhaps I would have laughed if it was in a different Chaplin movie but what is it doing in here? The usual social comments are also involved but while they were spoton in Modern Times and The Great Dictator here they're just weird. Apparently our protagonist kills people and takes their money because the economy is so bad and he has no choice fair enough and also the real mass murderers are actually the world leaders. To me that doesn't really justify killing bunches of innocent people but I guess I shouldn't judge. This is an odd thing to see but the overall style and Chaplin's performance makes some parts worthwhile.".

	onyx:emotionText "For this one Chaplin mostly ditched his old slapstick antics and went for more of a dark cynical tone. That idea really works out well in the first half because it's just really intriguing to watch Chaplin play a coldblooded killer. It's just so out of the ordinary. Sadly the movie starts dragging from then on because the pace is so slow and there is virtually no variation in the scenes. Every scene is Chaplin courting women and occasionally trying to kill them. Also he gets in some funny situations that are not really very funny. Especially the wedding scene goes on for way too long and seems really out of place. Perhaps I would have laughed if it was in a different Chaplin movie but what is it doing in here? The usual social comments are also involved but while they were spoton in Modern Times and The Great Dictator here they're just weird. Apparently our protagonist kills people and takes their money because the economy is so bad and he has no choice fair enough and also the real mass murderers are actually the world leaders. To me that doesn't really justify killing bunches of innocent people but I guess I shouldn't judge.

	schema:reviewBody "Charlie Chaplin is of course best known for the slapstick work he did in the silent period. He however made some equally good and also equally funny talky movies of which this movie is perhaps his greatest moment as a talking actor.In a way the movie got made like and old fashioned Chaplin movie in terms of the character's approach the story and also the humor. This movie has still some slapstick moments in it but it foremost is a comedy that relies on its story and acting performances. It's a more subtle and darker comedy without being an heavy one. I still wished the movie would had some more slapstick humor in it since the movie begins so incredibly well and promising with this. Perhaps this was done on intention to let people think this movie was going to be simply like a classic Chaplin movie.The movie foremost is a great accomplishment from Chaplin himself who hadn't made a movie for 7 years before completing this one. As always he didn't just starred in it but also wrote and directed the movie. With The Great Dictator he had already shown before that he could come out of the silent movie era and still make some great comedies and with this movies he shows his talents once more. He also with this movie shows that he can play other comedy characters just as effectively without portraying the tramp with his cane and bowler. You also have to remember that Chaplin was close at being 60 years old already at the time of this production but his never ever showed on screen. Instead it looked liked they had to use heavy makeup in the later scenes to really make him look like an 'older' guy.Basically Chaplin's performance is what makes this movie such a great one to watch. He shows that he was a real great actor and not just comicalwise. It's a great role and he also brings out the best of the other actors. Martha Raye was for instance also real enjoyable in her role.The movie its story itself got based on true story and the first script for it got written by Orson Welles. It still seems like a quite odd thing to set a comedy around a ladykiller who seduces widows for their money before killing them off. No surprise that the movie had some controversy surrounding it at the time. But that's what makes black comedies also often such strong ones. It doesn't use everyday normal characters but instead focus on the more downsides of life and the true nature of people and their struggle for survival in a tough world.A late Charles Chaplin movie that is perhaps his greatest talking moment actorwise.810httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

Each of these movies are great on their own but they lack that extra touch of wild imagination that only Buuel could deliver.Watching Los Olvidados more than half a century after it was made it's very clear to see why Buuel remains a oneof akind filmmaker in movie history as he combines social commentary political concern artistic invention wild creativity ferocious sarcasm daring eroticism acid humor and unique visual style all present here. Buuel was 50 years old when he directed this film as his understanding of human nature shows but it has the vigor boldness and freshness of a young man's work. It must be mentioned how anticlich Buuel's films were and how faithful to his surrealistic beginnings he remained and maybe that's why his films have survived so well through the years  they're still so surprising! His characters are never taken for granted they're never black or white but always fascinating and disturbing. Think of the twisted characters in Los Olvidados the blind man the mother Ojitos the girl the grandfather and all the kids...Some unforgettable sequences the young girl Melche pouring milk over her bare legs to a very sensuous effect Pedro throwing an egg at the camera at us sadistic voyeurs of his misfortunes wow!

Any movie director would be very happy to have just one of these great finales but Buuel got them both !!!It must be mentioned that the DVD at least the one distributed in Brazil brings the alternative happy ending which would have partially destroyed the impact of the film. In sticking to the crude and pessimistic ending Buuel retained his artistic integrity which helps explain in part why Buuel had been out of mainstream cinema for 20 years. He wouldn't compromise  can you think of just one handful of filmmakers today of whom you could say that? And just for the record Buuel's salary as a writerdirector for this one was a staggering U 2000 and no percentage. Enough said.INTERESTING FACTS as told in Buuel's autobiography Mon Dernier Soupir  a mandatory book for all interested in artistic creativity Los Olvidados only got made because Buuel had had a financial success the previous year with his second Mexican film El Gran Calavera. As a preparation for Olvidados and wearing his worst clothes Buuel circulated for five months in slums and poor areas around Mexico City to get the right feel and language for the characters. When the film was released in Mexico it was attacked by everyone as an insult to the country and its people  and remained just 4 days in theaters. Buuel was threatened and attacked an exiled Spaniard showing those filthy lies about Mexico!. Only after the triumph in Cannes the film became internationally recognized as a masterpiece and went back to theaters in Mexico winning the respect of critics and intellectuals an array of awards and allowing Buuel to continue his career there.Don't miss this one!! It will impact you on multiple levels and strike you as astonishingly daring and contemporary. My vote 10 out of 10 a definitive revolutionary masterpiece that may also be a lifechanging experience.".

Histories about brave Mexican machos riding horses singing songs to beautiful girls and drinking a lot of tequila were produced with success. By that time actors like Pedro Infante Jorge Negrete and Pedro Armedariz were real idols and people were in line to see the most recent productions. Then Luis Buuel wrote the story about the poverty and conditions of street children in Mexico City. No matter that the production photography direction and even the performances of relatively unknown actors were most than good no matter that for the first time in Mexico someone produced a film totally different with the influence of the Italian Neorealism No matter that someone had the guts to film the reality of the majorities living in big cities Buuel was severally criticized and even censored. The film produced a lot of reactions in the prosper Mexico. How is possible that someone could say that this is the reality in this country? How is possible that a person from another country filmed a Mexican history about something that really he didn't know? At that time most of the persons were against the movie but then something happen. In Cannes Festival 1951 Los Olvidados received the award for best direction and all reviews and comments about the film and Buuel were positive. When the international festival ended Mexican authorities decided to release the movie again to the cinemas and the success was immediate. By the end of the year 1951 Los olvidados won 11 Ariel awards Oscar equivalent for Mexican productions including the golden Ariel for best picture and three different awards for Buuel directing screenplay and adaptation. Why is important to mention this? Fortunately for the good of filming industry worldwide Buuel received the support and budget to continue with his projects. Probably the history had been very different if Cannes festival didn't recognize the work of one of the greatest directors ever. Now this movie is considered as a cult and classic and a reference for many film makers world wide. Directors like Kurosawa Bergman Fellini Godard Kubrick and so many more talked about this film and Buuel work in general as magnificent superb brilliant. That's why this film is so important. Talking about the movie and the history we can stand out the surrealist images along the entire movie. The scene of Pedrito's dream is nothing but brilliant. Then when the blind man is assaulted by the young kids there is a reference with the chicken in front of him. When El Jaibo is killed by the cop we see the image floating around with a dog. This is the first FREE work of Buuel since the the golden age in 1930. He made a totally new concept for Mexican films. He told the audiences that real life is not a happy history is made of common people with problems passions misery and even in that conditions is possible to have the most deeply emotions. He showed on screen the impacting endings beautiful images and shakes the conscience of thousands. Los olvidados is one of his finest films and with no doubt the first great Mexican movie fair to mention Emilio Fernadez' Maria Candelaria 1944 and Publerina 1948 as it closest contending. Recently and alternate ending for the movie was released to the public. In that sequence we saw Pedrito returning to the children house after he bought the cigarettes to the principal. A happy end. He was forced to shoot it but again fortunately the crude and strong outcome prevailed for the good of the history to show us that a lot of times real life is not necessary a happy conclusion that sometimes there are children with good intentions in wrong environments that poverty is a monster that is consuming the majority that horrible crimes could be committed with apparently cold blood that sometimes someone like Buuel could shake our conscience once a while. Los Olvidados a must see movie and reference.".

	schema:headline " A Masterpiece";
	schema:reviewBody "Please right now take away the featured user comment that calls Los Olvidados a nice short drama. This is perhaps the worst assessment of any movie I have ever heard and whoever said it cannot recognize how masterful the film is because his or her senses have been dulled by too many action movies. I say that because this film from surrealist master Luis Buuel is as admirable as nearly any portrait of poverty and crime with the probable exception of DeSica's The Bicycle Thief. In fact though Los Olvidados is much much more brutal and harrowing than The Bicycle Thief not to say that this assures it to be a superior film.  Buuel mostly takes a break from his surrealist tendencies in this film with the exception of a few remarkably effective dream sequences and creates a ultrarealist portrait of Mexican slums that is uncompromisingly frank. All the characters including a young boy caught up in a dangerous gang his harsh mother the gang leader and vicious bully and a bitter old blind man among others and what transpires among them are expertly captured by Buuel's camera.  To characterize this movie I would call it a much more bleak and brutal Neorealist film with a touch of surrealism. I would also characterize it as a masterpiece. Why this film does not show up on more top film lists I am unsure but all I can say is that it should not be missed by any serious film connoisseur.".

	onyx:emotionText "Please right now take away the featured user comment that calls Los Olvidados a nice short drama. This is perhaps the worst assessment of any movie I have ever heard and whoever said it cannot recognize how masterful the film is because his or her senses have been dulled by too many action movies. I say that because this film from surrealist master Luis Buuel is as admirable as nearly any portrait of poverty and crime with the probable exception of DeSica's The Bicycle Thief. In fact though Los Olvidados is much much more brutal and harrowing than The Bicycle Thief not to say that this assures it to be a superior film.  Buuel mostly takes a break from his surrealist tendencies in this film with the exception of a few remarkably effective dream sequences and creates a ultrarealist portrait of Mexican slums that is uncompromisingly frank. All the characters including a young boy caught up in a dangerous gang his harsh mother the gang leader and vicious bully and a bitter old blind man among others and what transpires among them are expertly captured by Buuel's camera.  To characterize this movie I would call it a much more bleak and brutal Neorealist film with a touch of surrealism. I would also characterize it as a masterpiece.

	schema:reviewBody "Where do I start? Perhaps by writing WOW a few hundred times in a row...The very opening shots and voiceover warn us that this was not an optimistic movie. It instantly made me believe this would be Las Hurdes in Mexico something like a fictionalised version of Buuel's 1933 fauxdocumentary about the extreme poverty of the peasants in the remote Spanish Las Hurdes region. In the first half hour Los Olvidados's mood and style remained faithful to the influence of several Italian neorealist movies I'd seen namely De Sica and perhaps some early Pasolini namely Accattone. In a looser sense maybe also Mira Nair's Salaam Bombay! seemed to have gotten some inspiration from Buuel's movie. And finally I could also and more obviously see that Fernando Meirelles's Cidade de Deus City of God owed more than a little to this 1950 masterpiece. I love it when I finally get to see the movie that has influenced so many other usually minor but more famous films that have followed it even several decades after its release! Los Olvidados would still have been an excellent film even if it had remained Italian neorealisticlike till the end. But to my delight and wonder it became something much more unique and memorable as soon as its own distinct Buuelian flavour kicked in halfway through IMO elevating this picture to something more than just powerfully gritty and cinematically honest as can be said and admired in the works of De Sica Rossellini et al. To be honest though I AM Italian and the spirit of neorealism is somehow deeply embedded in my cultural subconscious my problem with the Italian neorealists has always been their lack of vision or refusal to also venture into the otherworldly the spiritual the dreamlike the allegorical. Though I bow before the greatness of the Italian neorealist masters I will never feel completely conquered by their otherwise mesmerising pictures. Before watching Los Olvidados I was never quite sure of the reason for this. With this movie Buuel has finally put his finger on exactly what I've always found was missing in pictures like Sciusci Accattone and Roma Citt Aperta for them to truly get not just under my skin but into my wildest dreams and imagination as well  an ability to interweave the fantastical in something that couldn't be more grounded in reality. Yet why can't the lives of the underprivileged underbelly of the world in this case a Mexican shantytown of the late 40s also evoke magic? Is the fantastical only a privilege of the bougeoisie? I think not! Thank you Buuel for inspiring me into thinking about this...".

	schema:reviewBody "Los Olvidados translated as The Young and the Damned is a treatise on the streetlife of kids in Mexico City. There are at least three characters who are of focus here and three others on the sidelines with equal importance El Jaibo a rough young man who's grown up on the street his whole life and who's picked up more than his share of wicked egodriven habits Big Eyes as he's called by a Blind Man he's credited as Lost Boy on this site is a kid whose lost his father and is taken in by the oldfashioned hardened old man who lives next to the girl Meche and Pedro the hero is deep down a good soul but with a side that just wants to roam the streets at the carelessness of his estranged mother who like her son is poverty stricken. Pedro one day witnesses Jaibo commit a killing of a squealer and this puts him in a bad position as his relationship with his mother unfolds and so on. All through Los Olvidados based on real events and real people from the streets I kept on feeling for these people in the same way I did for the characters I saw in the neorealism movies like La Terra Trema and Shoeshine. Here are people who are so starkly depicted who can practically smell the streets coming off of them. That they are nonprofessionals in real settings like in those movies and the stories are such simple yet heartfelt goes to show the mastery of Luis Bunuel. While he became infamous for such films in the thirties like Un Chien Andalou and L'Age D'Or and later for such originals like Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie and the obscure Phantom of Liberty the climax in that is something that could've inspired most grossout comedies of late this film displays his worth as a writerdirector outside of the reputation he garnered in that he tells us the story with the little details and complex emotions that the Italian directors were able to bring forth while every once in a while reminding us that it is his brand of moviemaking at work. And unlike his other works he does this everso fleetingly that I only caught his style creeping in twice the first was a tip of the hat to his surrealistic roots when Pedro has a dream that seems to correspond perfectly to his truths and the truths of the neighborhood as he asks her why in an earlier scene she didn't give him any meat. She brings over a large piece of meat and as she brings it to him a hand creeps up Jaibo that grabs at him to take it away. There is just enough imagery and just enough message that the dream works as one of Bunuel's best sequences. The second time was a very brief moment when Pedro is working with some chickens and eggs and at one point Pedro looks at the camera and throws an egg at the lens. Indeed this could be seen as out of place for such a straightforward drama on torrents of youth that resonate generation after generation this is inspired by neorealism to an extent yet probably inspired the likes of Clockwork Orange and even the recent City of God however we get an inkling of what Bunuel is trying to tell us these are real people in real settings and in a somewhat melodramatic story set in times of economic drought and such and feel for them as I do  but don't forget it's only a movie. In my opinion Los Olvidados should be discovered by movie buffs since it is possibly Bunuel's most accessible work but perhaps Discreet Charm would still be the first to see if wanting to get the Bunuel vein.".

Everything in this meticulous film has a purpose nothing is left to coincidence and 10 seconds missed is fatal the brilliance we're only used from Kurosawa and Eisenstein.  Buuel uses his intuitive graphics and metaphoric sequences rather than fancy lighting and cocky cinematography to emphasize his concern with the boys the protagonists the 'forgotten ones' and his aversion to the apathy of the fathers who haven't much screen time who mindnumbed think about sanctions rather than the causes of the delinquency.'Los Olvidados' deals with the distance between two generations especially the distance between fathers and sons.  Where that distance in 'a Clockwork Orange' and 'Fight Club' leads to virtually unbridled violence and in 'les Quatre cent coups' 1959 Truffaut to other misdemeanors not to mention the innocent mischief in 'les Mistons' 1957 Truffaut short here it leads to callousness and abuse of whatever is in the way.  But in the way of what?  Do the lives of 'the forgotten ones' have a direction at all apart from trite survival?Although M 1931 Fritz Lang already focuses on the psychological problems that delinquents can have first serial killer on celluloid ever the other movies mentioned above are all younger so I tend to believe that Los Olvidados was a groundbreaking film and inspired the other filmmakers. Correct me if I'm wrong.  Los Olvidados deals with the distance from the apathetic parents in Clockwork the parents are petitbourgeois populace in Fight Club seem to exist no parents at all generation x and in Quatre cent coups the parents have their own problems and not enough persuasiveness to create a solid ground.  Finally Los Olvidados reminded me of 'Rocco e i suoi fratelli' 1962 Visconti where a family moves to the city too and a disciplinary father figure lacks.This is another Buuel film that seems to have no precise beginning and no end.  It's just there with all its brilliance to raise a matter and should not be missed for it demands a distinguished place in film history somewhere between M and A Clockwork Orange.Why o why can't we vote 11 ".

	schema:reviewBody "Review contains mild spoilers.Watching Los Olvidados for the first time one gets the feeling that this is a film way ahead of it's time. Made nine years earlier than the critically acclaimed Truffaut classic Les Quatre Cents Coups The 400 Blows Los Olvidados is a much more powerful and realistic portrayal.

The DVD version does contain an alternate 'happy ending' which I'm glad wasn't chosen as it would have completely destroyed the whole impact of the film.Throughout you cannot help but think 'There but for the grace of God go I'. While set in 1950 this film could have been made last week. 50 years later we have films like City of God and very little progress has been made in terms of the society in which these kids live. The streets are dirty the fighting dirtier and there is an overwhelming sense of desperation throughout. It is evident that Pedro is trying and for various reasons failing to be a more educated and well behaved young man and the sadness of this is deeply echoed in the ending. At 80 minutes this is a comparatively short movie however it manages to get its message across very clearly. There are a few people who seem to dislike the dream sequences. I have to admit I found them unnerving as opposed to dislikeable. They added well to the overall ambiance of the film which in itself is a very disturbing piece of cinema history and very violent for the 50's when so many 'happy' Hollywood movies were doing their inevitable roundsMake no mistake this is no easy film to watch. The animal cruelty is particularly noticeable and while I stand to be corrected there is one scene in which a pair of chickens are literally clubbed to death by a frustrated and angry Pedro. Combine this with the general attitude to the animals some portrayed and some very real and it makes for uneasy viewing. Scenes like these would never be allowed nowadays thank God and yet the scene in question actually highlights our own misplaced loyalties While we are busy thinking about the atrocious way in which these animals are massacred we are also busy forgetting that this film is REALISM. There are children across the world living in exactly the same conditions as this film from 50 years ago and many of them are forgotten souls destined to the same fate as young Pedro. I am NOT condoning the use of the violence against the animals but it does give one food for thought on just where our priorities lie.This is sad brutal and dramatic film and one not to be missed. This is everything that '400 Blows' should have been. Sure it was a reasonably capable film but this is a true cinematic masterpiece with stunning imagery and a powerful insight into the world of 'The Young and the Damned'..".

Pat O'Brien isn't around to shepherd the boys back into the good graces of society.

Thinking Julian was responsible for sending him to jail Jaibo sets up an ambush and kills him.  Pedro is there when it happens and Jaibo tells him to keep his mouth shut or the same will happen to him.Pedro lives with his mother but she resents him for his father having gotten her pregnant when she was just 14 so she is cold towards Pedro and pushes him away.  Pedro wanders the streets sleeping and eating as catch can.  He runs into a young country boy Ojitos whose father has abandoned him in the marketplace  one less mouth to feed as the blind man says.  They find a place to sleep that night the barn of a friend's family.When Pedro gets a job to help out with expenses Jaibo shows up and steals a knife from the shop.  Pedro takes the blame and his mother turns him in to the police.  He's sent away to a state run farm.  Jaibo thinks Pedro's gonna rat on him for Julian's murder so he shows up and steals some money the farm director has given him to test his honesty. Jaibo flees back to the city and Pedro follows him.  A fight ensues and Pedro blurts out in front of a crowd that it was Jaibo who killed the other boy.  When Pedro returns to the barn to sleep that night he runs into Jaibo and is killed by him.  Meche the young girl rushes in and finds Pedro's body. Her grandfather tells her they don't want any trouble so they load the body onto a donkey and take it to a garbage dump outside town.  Jaibo is gunned down by the police moments later when he returns to his own hiding place.I told you this wasn't angels with dirty faces.The realism in this film is right there completely without sentiment.  When Pedro's mother signs the papers to send him away she tells the police officer she doesn't care to see her son before he goes off.  When Pedro is wandering the streets an older man comes up to him and offers him money for sex.  Julian's father is a drunk who staggers through the streets with a knife looking for his son's killer.  The blind man abuses Ojitos and throws him out.  When Jaibo is shot the blind man screams they should all end that way be killed before they're even born.The direction of this film is as sparse as the story it tells.  It's shot in black and white and there are no fancy backdrops just the streets of a poor Mexico City neighborhood.  Yet it is one of the richest films I know of  the characters are haunting and will stay with you long after the movie is over.  The end scene when Meche and her grandfather toss Pedro's body down the hillside through a pile of garbage is one of the most memorable images from any film I've ever watched.".

	schema:headline " One of cinema's masterpieces and still one of the most shocking films ever made.possible spoiler";
	schema:reviewBody "Last week 21st Feb was Don Luis' 100th birthday and I was privileged to see this masterpiece at the Irish Film Centre introduced by Neil Jordan. Bunuel is always considered one of the giants of cinema even though his reputation is outrageously in terminal decline.  Maybe because it's such an unmanageable oeuvre.  Take this film for instance usually considered one of his five best films.  It is one of the cruellest most vicious and unwatchable films ever made as well of course as one of the most brilliant.The film treats of the titular heroes the young and the damned as the subtitles quaintly translate them the real translation is the far less censorious 'The Forgotten Ones' young hooligans messing about rubbled shanty towns in Mexico City.  Two of these boys are foregrounded Jaibo a murderous lout just escaped from reform school who behaves like a hounded animal lashing out at everyone who gets in his way hero of all the younger boys and Pablo a sensitive child craving his mother's love who comes to see Jaibo's subversiveness for what it is.In these unshockable times it's hard to believe that a film half a century old  in black and white mind  can have the power to assault the viewer so relentlessly.  The catalogue of violent horrors are endless  a blind man is firstly robbed than mugged this victim turns out to be a fascist paedophile a legless man is robbed and his cart is kicked away this sequence is uncomfortably funny Jaibo stones a friend in the back of the head and then clubs him to death a frustrated Pablo caged in a reform school violently dispatches some chickens etc.In the hands of a reactionary director this ghastly material could have been used to expose the terrors of liberalism and the slipping of moral values.  Bunuel the great Surrealist atheistic leftwing auteur shows that it is those moral values that are the problem.  He has great sympathy with his deeply unpleasant heroes revelling in their energy and invention never patronising in one scene they actually attack the camera while never flinching from their cruelty.  Even the most irredeemably vicious of them all Jaibo is granted moments of explanatory tenderness and an epiphanic death of sublime beauty denied to the pinched victimaveugle who urges that all the young toughs are shot.Bunuel's documentary approach is continually rent by 'breaching' subjectivity and it is to his outcasts he offers this privilege Jaibo and Pablo the latter's haunting dream mixing guilt motherdesire and the reality of meaty dead animal flesh is one of the great achievements of the cinema.

	onyx:emotionText "Last week 21st Feb was Don Luis' 100th birthday and I was privileged to see this masterpiece at the Irish Film Centre introduced by Neil Jordan. Bunuel is always considered one of the giants of cinema even though his reputation is outrageously in terminal decline.  Maybe because it's such an unmanageable oeuvre.  Take this film for instance usually considered one of his five best films.  It is one of the cruellest most vicious and unwatchable films ever made as well of course as one of the most brilliant.The film treats of the titular heroes the young and the damned as the subtitles quaintly translate them the real translation is the far less censorious 'The Forgotten Ones' young hooligans messing about rubbled shanty towns in Mexico City.  Two of these boys are foregrounded Jaibo a murderous lout just escaped from reform school who behaves like a hounded animal lashing out at everyone who gets in his way hero of all the younger boys and Pablo a sensitive child craving his mother's love who comes to see Jaibo's subversiveness for what it is.In these unshockable times it's hard to believe that a film half a century old  in black and white mind  can have the power to assault the viewer so relentlessly.  The catalogue of violent horrors are endless  a blind man is firstly robbed than mugged this victim turns out to be a fascist paedophile a legless man is robbed and his cart is kicked away this sequence is uncomfortably funny Jaibo stones a friend in the back of the head and then clubs him to death a frustrated Pablo caged in a reform school violently dispatches some chickens etc.In the hands of a reactionary director this ghastly material could have been used to expose the terrors of liberalism and the slipping of moral values.  Bunuel the great Surrealist atheistic leftwing auteur shows that it is those moral values that are the problem.  He has great sympathy with his deeply unpleasant heroes revelling in their energy and invention never patronising in one scene they actually attack the camera while never flinching from their cruelty.  Even the most irredeemably vicious of them all Jaibo is granted moments of explanatory tenderness and an epiphanic death of sublime beauty denied to the pinched victimaveugle who urges that all the young toughs are shot.Bunuel's documentary approach is continually rent by 'breaching' subjectivity and it is to his outcasts he offers this privilege Jaibo and Pablo the latter's haunting dream mixing guilt motherdesire and the reality of meaty dead animal flesh is one of the great achievements of the cinema.  But Bunuel's surrealism shapes the whole film the dreamlike nightscapes in the streets the prisonlike houses etc.Much of the film's anger is aimed at the sheer inhumanity inflicted on los olvidados.

The great usage of lighting in this black and white movie is fantastic. The camera angles with the different sources of lighting helped enhance the dramatic elements and storyline. The dream sequence is the most memorable because the scene has many techniques used in it. The shot with the mother going toward the son's bed is slowed down in slow motion with wind blowing around her. This creates a stunning visual and draws importance to what Pedro the son is thinking about his mother.".

	schema:headline " Sensational neorealist film with a moment of great surrealism";
	schema:reviewBody "After his exile from his native Spain director Luis Bunuel moved to Mexico in 1946 gaining citizenship in 1949. It was here where he would make his more generic films by his standards as he honed his own directorial skill while never straying too far from his surrealistic background. After the success of his comedy The Great Madcap 1949 he was commissioned by producer Oscar Dancigers to make a serious film about child poverty in Mexico City and out of it came Los Olvidados or The Young and the Innocent to give it it's American title. Bunuel apparently spent months disguised as a homeless amongst the poverty stricken children of the slums in order to research and if that tale is true it certainly came off as Los Olvidados is one of the best and most realistic depictions of the innocent turning to crime in a fit of desperation.The film follows three children in the same slum. Pedro Alfonso Mejia is a young tearaway who wants to change his ways and work in order to help out his mother who neglects him due to her constant work. 'Little Eyes' Mario Ramirez has been abandoned by his father and is adopted by the blind beggar Don Carmelo Miguel Inclan a bitter man who frequently voices his opinions on the young criminals of the city. El Jaibo Robert Cobo has just been released from prison and immediately sets about gaining revenge of the boy he thinks ratted him out. Jaibo and Pedro corner the boy only for Jaibo to bludgeon him to death and the two boys flee. Pedro struggles to keep himself out of trouble and leaves home after being accused of stealing a knife only to find his and Jaibo's paths repeatedly crossing.At its heart this is pure neorealism sharing its tone most obviously with Vittorio de Sica's masterpiece The Bicycle Thieves 1948 in exposing poverty and class divide as the main cause of criminality due to the ill education and the hopelessness of the young. Although out of nowhere comes a surrealistic dream sequence so beautiful and so haunting that you know you're watching Bunuel and his artistic creativity seems to bulge from the screen. Best known for his mocking of the upperclasses the bourgeois were clearly as fascinating to Bunuel as they were repugnant here he stays in the slums promoting as much sympathy for its filthy lead characters as hatred.Jaibo is a true monster raised without parents he bullies his way through life grasping any opportunity that presents itself he even manages to seduce Pedro's lonely and overworked mother and rob a legless man. It is Pedro who is the beating heart of the film especially when he leaves home and we witness the state of the lower classes from his eyes and how they are viewed in one powerful sequence an upper class man obviously propositions him for sex but we only see their exchange as we watch them through a window. Bunuel then manages to deliver not one but two sensational endings that manage to move and shock as much as the famous and upsetting climax to Bicycle Thieves. Bunuel would go to France to create his greatest works but Los Olvidados displays many of the attributes that made Bunuel one of the most important directors in the history of film as well as being a great film in its own right.www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com".

Without proper role models the children turn to El Jaibo who has just escaped from reform school. One of my favorite scenes is when Pedro breaks the 4th wall by throwing an egg at the camera.

But for me Young and damned is special  because Buuel managed to unite an important topic of poverty human cruelty to each other and surrealism. This film is truthful because Buuel showed on the screen everything that he saw on the streets of Mexico and it's relevant because much of what is shown in it happens nowadays in a lot of countries all over the world. This movie teaches you to appreciate things that you have by showing childhood in poverty .".

A timeless movie. What we see on the screen as a reality of Mexico in the 1950s continues to be a reality today in many places of the world I who recently worked in African countries for 6 years do not forget the reality that I saw day by day well close and that is very close to the one we see in the movie. Yesterday as today society continues to corrupt individuals here personified in the character of little Peter. His intentions were good but sometimes it is very difficult to fight against a kind of destiny that already seems to have been traced. It is even very difficult for many to oppose or evade a kind of propagation of evil which seems to be and increasingly instituted and rooted in society and which ultimately destroys or corrupts individuals even those endowed with a kind of magic purity or at least some. The pessimistic tone of the film although it may not please many has every reason to be for this is the reality of things.

	schema:headline " A young ethics student uses esoteric martial practices to foment rebellion against a foreign occupying force.";
	schema:reviewBody "Perhaps cultural differences prevent understanding the significance and excellence of this film.The original title The 36th Chamber of Shaolin refers to San Te requesting from the Head Abbot of Shaolin permission to teach Shaolin martial skills to Han Chinese to give them the tools needed to fight the occupying Manchus of the Qing Dynasty 16441910 who were seen as outsiders. Chinese today still generally hate the Qing and wish that dynasty never happened as their corruption and shortsightedness in the 20th Century was perceived to have weakened the country leading to some regions being colonized by many foreign powers at the time. Hong Kong was a colony taken by the British after humiliating the Chinese in a resounding defeat in the Opium Wars.The fact that the Hong Kong film industry made films about rebellion should be understood within this context of Hong Kong as a British Colony. Master Lau is Cantonese as was Wong Feihung so has a particular closeness to the problematic colonial relationship with the occupying British. This is why I consider this film to be an interesting example of post colonial film.This background is essential to understanding the significance of the statement made by Master Lau in this film. It is not just a simple revenge tale but the revenge is the moral and ethical response in Chinese the technicalphilosophical term is righteousness or in English best described as justice for the brutal murder of his classmates ethics teacher and his family. In the first part of the film Master Killer played by Master Lau's adopted brother Liu Chiahui Master Lau's real brother plays the rebellious General Yin who fights with the ax is studying Confucian ethics. After all their friends and family are ruthlessly slaughtered for participating in a revolt against the occupying Qing Manchu forces Master Killer's friend laments that it was pointless to study ethics as it was useless for them to save their loved ones and resist the Qings. No Master Killer replies ethics has taught us to be loyal another Confucian term to our loved ones so we must get revenge. If either of us survive we MUST make it to Shaolin learn martial arts and get revenge! This political message is what makes this film more than just an arbitrary action film. In the West actioners typically don't embed violence in such a bitter context. Here the violence holds deep meaning within the context of foreign invasion and occupation. Here it is seen as the ethical action which is how San Te responds to his first victim of revenge where he meets Hung Xiguan when his victim demands You can't kill me you're a monk! To which San Te replies Even Buddha punished evil! Though HK cinema had just a fraction of the budget enjoyed by the glorified garbage of most Hollywood actioners it makes up for in dangerous political messages unparalleled martial arts mayhem and real martial skills of the actors. The actors in these films like Bollywood films where the actors have to display dancing skills actually have to do something skillful on screen as opposed to just prancing around like primadonnas. If you think the acting is overdone this results from HK cinema arising out of Peking Opera traditions like Sammo Hung Jackie Chan Yuen Biao and Corey Yuen came out of which has a particular style of acting that has its own idiom.Some background This film is directed and choreographed by Master Lau Liu Chialiang or Lau Kar Leung. His father and grandfather were disciples of Butcher Wing as depicted by Sammo Hung in The Magnificent Butcher who was Wong Feihung's toughest disciple. Wong Feihung's style is Hunggar named for Hung Xiguan Donnie Yen plays him in the Hong Kong TV show released in the US on DVD as The Kungfu Master and Revenge of the Kungfu Master the only disciple to survive the burning of the Shaolin Temple there was more than one temple.For this legendary story these stories form a sort of oral history in martial arts circles but may be doubted by Western historians who specialize in rejecting oral histories such as the Hemmings' family oral histories of Thomas Jefferson's habitual raping of his wife's half sister Sally Hemmings a good movie to see is Heroes Two and its sequel Disciples of Death starring Chen Kuan Tai a real master of Monkey Kungfu as Hung Xiguan and Alexander Fu Sheng the kungfu genius who tragically died in an auto accident in his prime around 1984 as Fang Shiyu aka Fong Saiyuk also played by Jet Li in two movies of the same name. This film is the beginning of all these movies as it shows the history that produced San Te the first Shaolin monk to teach outsiders.I hope some of this history background and perspective will help viewers appreciate the greatness of this film. Other films Lau made or helped choreograph that I recommend is The Deadly Duo The Heroic Ones Shaolin Mantis Mad Monkey Kungfu Executioners of Death Heroes Two its sequel Disciples of Death Five Masters of Death Shaolin Martial Arts Legendary Weapons of Kungfu 8 Diagram Pole Fighters Disciples of Master Killer Master Killer III 19845 Legend of Drunken Master Drunken Master II etc. Many of the movies he is involved with are worth watching at least for their action even if sometimes the plot lines are a little weak.This film has it all action drama good characters great plot and some of the best fight scenes put to celluloid. DON'T SLEEP ON THIS! Though I've literally seen thousands of the best films from all over the world of all different time periods this one is one of my alltime favorites!! I hope you enjoy it even a fraction of how much I do!".

This movie started the whole goodguygetshisbuttkickedandundergoesmartial artstrainingtoexactvengeance storyline that's been used so many times in the martial arts movies since i.e. the American Karate Kid movies. In it antiManchu patriot San Te Gordon Liu is a humble country boy who is cast out of his village when Manchu soldiers led by the villainous Lo Lieh slaughter his parents orphaning him. He manages to make it to the famous Shaolin Temple where he is nursed back to health by the monks living there and soon undergoes a rigorous and dangerous regiment of training to master the 35 chambers styles of kungfu. In seven years he completes his training mastering all 35 styles invents a brandnew weapon the threesection staff and suggests creating a 36th chamber  to spread kungfu beyond the Shaolin Temple's walls and bring it to the masses. The whole story is pretty formulaic what martial arts movie from the '70s doesn't have a formulaic plot? but what gets this movie going is its rousing training sequences. These are not the runofthemill stuff we're used to seeing in these movies. San Te's quest to become a martial arts warrior is a tortuous journey of selfactualization a kind of virtue commonly lacking in the genre San Te actually becomes a better person as a result of his experiences at the Shaolin Temple. Most grindhouse cinema aficionados love this movie WuTang Clan cofounder the RZA in The WuTang Manual does an entire section on the martial arts movies that influenced his development of the WuTang Clan and much of their underlying philosophy. Finally I'm glad to see an oldschool martial arts movie that has its heart and brain in the right places.1010".

Finally I'm glad to see an oldschool martial arts movie that has its heart and brain in the right places.1010";

Following the fortunes of a young rebel as he escapes from the tyranny of the government to a Shaolin temple where he hopes to learn superior kung fu techniques we see his development from an inexperienced boy to an unrivalled master.It is wonderful to see the rigours of training in each 'chamber'. The water crossing scenes are a delight. And some of the pain these students go through to perfect their bodies and art is impressive indeed.I cannot recommend this enough. Indeed everyone should attempt to snap up any Shaw Brothers movie from around that period. The 36th Chamber stands head and shoulders above the rest and is what all Martial Arts directors should aspire to.Thanks Shaw's and Chia Hui Liu for a truly great experience EVERY time.".

To be fair I have to give notice that every movie with him and the director who I understand is a relative is good.  Now let me tell why.  Liu gives effort and emotion to his parts. Every part and every movie I have seen him in this has been the case. When there is anger you see it in his face.  When there is despair you see it. He makes it almost tangible.  Plus he has skills.  Also this movie has plot and believability.  It's interesting and absorbing.  The one I watched was English dubbed but the dubbing was good.  Even the sound track was complimentary for the scenes.I's unfortunate that the asian movie industry has been in the past just like the American sports industry was.  The take talented young people chew up their juices and then spit them out all used up.I wonder if Liu even suspected that he had attained Classic status with this movie as far as old school KungFu fans in the Northeast USA are concerned?".

	schema:reviewBody "Most people who watched old Kung Fu movies know this movie simply as Master Killer. This is one of a select few non Chang Cheh directed Kung Fu movies that I really really like. This movie is a reference point of the old training kung fu flicks.This movie is famous for its rigorous training scenes performed by Chia Hui Liu Gordon Liu. Somehow you get a feel for how being a student in the Shaolin Temple was really like. All of the teachers are Monks and they sport the usual bald heads accompanied with almost mysterious wisdom.  Master Killer seems to be a well directed movie so you become engulfed in the students plight.Noteworthy about this movie is how as a viewer at first you don't take Master Killer seriously as a fighter he just doesn't look tough. When he struggles with his kung fu as he goes from one chamber to the next it is uplifting as he slowly becomes better. Master Killer starts off as a huge underdog in this movie and as much as you laughed at him when he first started to learn you are amazed at his skill as he progresses. This I feel is what makes Master Killer stand out as one of the best training kung fu movies.There are many memorable training chambers. One chamber tests his sight there are 2 burning posts on each side of his head. If he moves his head even the slightest the sides of his head will be badly burned.  He watches an object move from side to side faster and faster the object is to move your eyes and not your head eventually Master Killer master all of the chambers.Before he can leave the Temple he has to fight one of the Head Monks at the temple initially he is no match for the monk but Master Killer invents a new kind of fighting weapon and takes on the head monk again and is able to be victorious. The fight scenes with Gordon and this monk are very good. Many different weapons are used as well as hand to hand combat this is an excellent example of the essence of Shaolin Kung Fu.Anyone who loves old kung fu flicks will certainly be taken in by Master Killer also called Enter the 36 Chambers. I can't explain it but this is certainly Gordon Liu's signature film he certainly was made to play..... the Master Killer.".

The goal is the 36th Chamber which participants have to endure a previous 35 to get to with a series of increasingly impossible disciplines.

Knowing that any video that said Shoalin Master killer or just Master killer would be a English dubbed atrocity I decided to wait.Perhaps the best geek news of 2003 for me however was Celestial pictures releasing region 3 versions of old Shaw bros classics. Original language subtitled well subtitled bonus features Dolby surround Beautifully remastered and packaged. Director Liu Chia liang's masterpiece the 36th chamber was my first purchase in the series. The new reissues have some of his other classics like executioners from shoalinwhich Kill Bill 2 paid direct tribute to8 diagram pole fighter and soon  Legendary weapons of China. 36th chamber tells a fictionalized tale of the shoalin monk who broke rank with his temple and taught Kung Fu to the people. While the true story probably did not have the elements of revenge that make the story of the film that hardly manners this is a movie not a history class. It is a lesson the nonviolent resistors of the world need to here again and again. When Gordon Liu and his fellow students ask them selves how can they defeat their violent enemy words of logic.They decide that if they are going to effectively fight back what they learn at the university is not enough. So they travel to the shoalin temple. At the shoalin temple they are masters of martial arts but they stay out of worldly affairs. The 35th chamber of shoalin is the highest level and it is not a measure of strength of combat ability. It is enlightenment mastery of oneself.So this epic film a 2 hour chop socky flick that's story takes place over 10 years has a interesting plot. Can this man driven by anger complete training in Buddhist temple where his motivations are against the very basics of there teachings. It is impossible to imagine Hollywood making movie that includes forty minutes of Buddhist philosophy training and no love story. Well lets face it I not sure a woman is in this movie at all.The martial arts in this film are amazing and every bit as impressive as stuff done today. The training parts while probably not realistic are entertaining and don't bore. The acting is all well done. The direction is steady the story well told.For fans of this film note that the director star and studio teamed up last year to make a film called drunken monkey. Shaw bros big return to Kung Fu movies has been well received. It's next on my list to rent.".

	schema:reviewBody "I think this is the very best martial arts movie ever made. Kung Fu Gong Fu in modern Pinyin just means a man who has a great achievement in skill after much hard and wise work. Wu Shu in Mandarin. Mou Seut in Cantonese means MARTIAL ARTS. Many Americans rave about Bruce Lee movies but they have seen few or no Chinesse movies that star men much more skillful than Lee Sinsaang. The movie takes us inside a Shao Lin New Forest this Lin is my surname in Mandarin or Siu LamSil Lum in Cantonese temple to see the severe training monks underwent. They would not be allowed to eat without performing some exercises properly for instance. Liu ChiaHui or Gordon Liu plays a youth who wants to learn martial arts to use against the Manchu oppressors who ruled China 16441912. As was the case with Bhodidharma Da Mo in China he has difficulty being admitted. He wants to start at the top in the 35th Chamber but he quickly learns it is best to start at the bottom in Lo Yat Ho Chamber 1. Beautiful Chen SzuChia also stars in this film. He masters the training and at the end he opens a 36th chamber to teach people outside the temple some martial arts to use against tyrants. About 25 years later Gordon Liu was in the two Kill Bill movies in two roles.".

The village is oppressed by the manchus so San te a student joins a revolution The Manchus destroy the city and San Te wanders to Shaolin temple. There he learns kung fu and goes back to his home town to help fight the manchus.I love San Te's character change. He goes from a scholar to a martial artist into a savior for his people. The middle 40 or so minutes is one big training montage. Its awesome. Very few movies make you feel as good as this movie does. It makes you feel happy in the same way Rocky does that if you set your mind to something you can accomplish anything. A great great film.".

Here in America the people walk through their daily lives as if mandatory cogs in the wheel of social and economic progression. We take risks if necessary but otherwise lead completely safe lives under the wing of democracy and police surveillance. A lot is taken for granted and not all of us ever would have stepped into the World Trade Center as it crumbled to the Earth but the donations were all left with neat and tidy care packages as the firemen walked around in a glass haze of destruction. There is not much that America holds onto as far as risks.China has always been a mainstay of American idolism with the aspects of KungFu science and Buddhism that trickle in across the oceans that separate us. Needless to say there are many sharp contrasts between our cultures even in today's modern age. For one the Chinese adhere to Communism whereas our government only takes advantage of the loopholes to create an illusion of Republic.I should have learned kung fu instead of ethics. If I could fight I could've stopped them! KungFu another mainstay of cinematic culture in America had its beginnings in the ancient days of Buddhism when teachers at select schools of thought allowed their students to take up boxing. It began as Karate and quickly evolved to contain a more fluid motion and movement in fighting style. Buddhists were not allowed to actually hurt other people so the reason for their training remained mysterious until the WuTang or Southern revolution that caused the burning of the main temple in Shaolin.Master Killer or The 36th Chamber Of Shaolin is based on the legends that stirred around after the Southern farming lands of China reclaimed their unity across China. The ideas that were based in Shaolin at the time were based on a 35 Chamber training session that culminated in a mastering of physical movement to ultimately understand all of the major forms of fighting that could be used in battle. As we see in the film this was not at all constrained to the average stuff that is taught today at modern KungFu schools in America. In fact many of their practices would be made illegal if introduced these days in America.Gordon Liu by far one of the most underlooked and best KungFu actors in the business shines like a star in this film. From the opening credits' grunting display of superior KungFu to the humbleness of his approach to the temple we see a young man struggling against the oppression of China's police state known as Manchu. This was the idea of the film no doubt to show that even a young apprentice with limited expertise could ideally become one of the grand masters in a trade. Nonetheless the end sequence is so moving that we feel as though the American Rocky series owes more to it than anything ever done in American boxing.This is the greatest training film ever made surpassing anything I've ever seen in the way of showing how a young man can be transformed over time to an archetypical master of trade. Martial arts films were at one time real as this demonstrates for us and not whimsical artfests of CGI graphics. The results are stunning amazing awestriking and worth the time of every view. The direction is superb and the writing is hardhitting to the point of sublime reaction.After all those who are in charge must be very humble MASTER KILLER 1978 1010 Actors Chia Hui Liu Lieh Lo Chia Yung Liu Norman Chu Yang Yu Producer Mona Fong Run Run Shaw ChiaHsi Huang Cinematographer Huang YehTai Music YungYu Chen Editor Hing Lung Gueng Yen Hae Li".

	schema:reviewBody "This is considered an alltime classic and after seeing it for the first time I more than see why. It's focused most of all on the training of martial arts specifically the Shaolin style if there is one I could be wrong on that. We get the set up that the movie needs  a warlord crashes into a village takes over and called 'Tartars' no less and a young man who is the son of a seafood shopowner runs off to get training with the Shaolin monks.For me this may be the greatest action movie I've seen having to do with training. I don't know if it's a completely great film overall  by the third act some of the characters are a little over the top in their mannerisms who the new San Te the masterful Gordon Liu later utilized by Tarantino in the Kill Bill movies wants to recruit for his 36th Chamber which is only to train new monks.Of course one will have to wait for the sequel to see how the entire 36th Chamber operates. But for now with this film I'd say about over an hour in the middle probably more is just dedicated to showing how San Te grows through each and every Chamber. Every obstacle is gripping and wonderful to watch some of them we see how rigorously he has to practice walking across small logs on a small body of water is one of them a highlight for me and some of them are nearly ridiculous how the older monks keep tapping for a wristtapping exercise on a gong which reaches a frenzied pace.I think though certainly if one is in the mood for it this is what I love seeing in a martial arts movie growth experience gaining not always so much full attack strength but just the ability to focus or moving your eyes really quickly from one point to the next. Does the hero use all of these skills in the climax? Eh maybe he will later if not now. It's just a lot of fun and it's exciting and almost kind of enlightening in a wholly Bmovie way to see this guy become tougher and stronger and ready to be ready to defend AND attack.Oh and the fights are badass to be sure when they do finally come as the director Liu ChiangLang also the choreographer cuts and shoots his fight scenes so that there's total intensity but really it's all on the performers to make it work not relying on the equipment. So if you like some fastzooms and some wicked sound fx and most importantly a story that is simple enough you can follow it a problem sometimes with kung fu flicks for me is the plots are needlessly complex not all but a good portion of them 36th Chamber hits the spot. It's the kind of action flick that gave me energy after I watched it like I wanted to do 100 pushups or something. But I digress.".

After he finishes the first stages of training in record time he is now highly respected and moves onto learning actual fighting styles. He breezes through this and becomes a great fighter in only 5 years or so. This is not one of those movies that has 1 or 2 training sequences. Gordon is shown in at least 13 of the chambers and half of the movie is spent at Shaolin. So after he has become a master fighter he is given a high honor and told that he can become second in charge of any of the 35 chambers. A senior monk played by the great Lee Hoi San objects to this and says that he can't have this honor unless Gordon defeats him in a weapons duel. Lee Hoi San does not play a villain but he does not think that Gordon is a good enough fighter to receive so much praise. His plan works better than he could have ever imagined. He ends up helping Gordon improve as a fighter and as a person. Gordon is told he can leave Shaolin now and he goes to take revenge on the evil General who killed his family.One thing that sets this movie apart is that it tries to be a real movie and it succeeds. Watching Gordon grow up into a man is remarkable to see. The commentators didn't notice but a lot of the stuff in this movie is very real. When Gordon has to use the pole with the wieght on the end to hit the bell over and over again that is a real weight on the end of the pole! Gordon talks in the interview included on this disc about how the sabres that Lo Lieh uses in the final fight are real and it just makes the movie that much better. Don't expect your average tale of revenge. I was touched deeply when I first saw this and there are not many kung fu movies that have as much meaning and feeling making it one of the best if not the best kung fu movie of all time.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have watched this about 5 times and it never gets old. There are so many great things about this film that makes it stand out among all the other martial arts films of its time. It carries a seriousness to it and has a good message.I know there is a true significance to this film if you are from Asia and know more about the history and culture but that is irrelevant when it comes to seeing the beauty in this film.After a man's village and family is destroyed he goes to the infamous ShaolinTemple to learn the art of fighting know as KungFu. The monks at Shaolin don't let outsiders in but give this young man a chance to prove himself and puts him underway through the 35 chambers of training. He goes way beyond their expectations and becomes a true master at all he does.Once he gets to the end he is given a chance to be the head teacher of any of the 35 chambers he chooses but asks to start a 36th chamber allowing him to teach the art to outsiders helping them learn to fight and protect themselves. He is told that such a thing is unheard of and the Shaolin monks do not teach outsiders. Ultimately he goes back to his old village and stands up and fights and takes charge of his old village and then proceeds to teach the people there how to fight.This movie's plot has been done a lot even as far back as David Carradine in Kung Fu in 1972 but there's something about this film that makes it great. Other films have had the Shaolin training aspects but none have focused as well and been as relevant as this one was.Brothers ChiLiang Liu and Gordon Liu are a nice package. Chi Liang's direction is simply beautiful. From his trademark solo technique training shots his movies often begin with to his wide long shots capturing tons of action in what appears to be a small frame. His closeups are intense and his long shots are breathtaking and haunting at times. Gordon Liu is the star and my all time favorite guy to watch fight. He has the look I like he has an appropriate body and he looks so superhero like yet normal and believable at the same time. Liu's style and techniques are unmatchable. His choreography is eye popping goodness. I could literally watch him fight all day. Between his 70's classics all the way to his double roles in KILL BILL he is just an actor and fighter that I have the highest respect for.The Shaw Brothers never let me down and I am so pleased and entertained with their films. The production is wonderful here the acting is superb. The Music is fitting and it's a nice film. One of the best you will find in the genre.With all that being said I must say I give it 8 stars. I loved the movie but it's still not completely original enough for me to place it higher. It didn't have the comedy aspect these kung fu films do and I am very happy about that but it also went by a bit quicker with story telling than I liked.. its very close to perfect film wise but martial arts wise it would get a solid 10 from me.".

	schema:reviewBody "The 36th Chamber of Shaolin is the movie of any kung fu fan's dreams. It was the movie that earnestly ignited my interest in martial arts movies when I first saw it about three years ago. I had been wowed by Jet Li in Fong Sai Yuk way back in 1995 but not done much about it until I saw 36th Chamber and several other Shaw Brothers movies at a film festival in I think 2002 might have been '01.This movie contained all the serious and arduous physical training that is so fascinating about martial arts and which so many movies  incl. kung fu movies  never show. The truth about martial arts is that you have to train very hard all the time in order to approach and maintain any kind of excellence and most movies never show the training. That's one of the main reasons I'm so beholden to what I call the better '70s kung fu movies like for instance Jackie Chan in Young Master because they make a point out of showing the training.My personal approach to martial arts is that it is the moves that are beautiful. I don't care that much about the violence. If I were to practice martial arts it would be to make all those wonderful moves I wouldn't want to hit anybody much less get hit by anybody. That's no fun!  So I appreciate kung fu movies that focus on demonstrating the serene beauty of the techniques without any tedious and unsavory violence. This is why I'm such a big fan of 7 Grandmasters also from 1978 where a master simply travels around and amicably fights other masters entirely civilly pretty as you please! Granted there's also a bad guy and a seriously violent finish but that's just for the popcorn audience.So a movie like 36th Chamber is a real gem to me. Again we do have the violence killing etc. since there has to be some kind of conflictdriven plot but it's the training and the techniques that it's really about. Gordon Liu does a fantastic job of it as the intensely driven Shaolin student and his career is worth following all the way up into the 1990s with such masterpieces of kung fu comedy as The Last Hero In China and others.I give 36th Chamber of Shaolin the nearstellar rating of 9 out of 10. Its only shortcoming is that while entertaining and great to look at it isn't exciting or suspenseful. It doesn't have the breathtaking and engrossing action of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon nor the extravagant visual spectacle or pensive depths of Hero  two movies that have both received 10 ratings from me.".

Films from 1964 seen in 1988 looked a zillion years apart.....how can a 1980s film like this one still be so new and play so fresh in 2014? ...Apart from it being funnier and truly inspired I really now appreciate more the legacy of John Hughes in his series of films that were released in that 5 year span 198489. Anthony Michael Hall is rightly celebrated and gorgeous Molly Ringwald deserves her fame in the teen hall of Stardom. Whatever happened to Michael Schoeffling Jake....anyone know? It seems incongruous that so many future stars got their start in this film yet he seemed to go nowhere. I am also very surprised it got a PG rating.......given the swearing and the nudity..but I guess in the spirit of it all it was a perfect pic for anyone 12  112. Very clever and very funny.".

Films from 1964 seen in 1988 looked a zillion years apart.....how can a 1980s film like this one still be so new and play so fresh in 2014? ...Apart from it being funnier and truly inspired I really now appreciate more the legacy of John Hughes in his series of films that were released in that 5 year span 198489. Anthony Michael Hall is rightly celebrated and gorgeous Molly Ringwald deserves her fame in the teen hall of Stardom. Whatever happened to Michael Schoeffling Jake....anyone know? It seems incongruous that so many future stars got their start in this film yet he seemed to go nowhere. I am also very surprised it got a PG rating.......given the swearing and the nudity..but I guess in the spirit of it all it was a perfect pic for anyone 12  112. Very clever and very funny.";

Didn't we all know a person like 'Farmer Ted' or a hot queenie like the blonde he hilariously gets.  It was every young freshman's fantasy.  This funny flick is also a relic of the 80's that is not all that dated.The jokes still work as long as you see it uncut and it is neat seeing things of the not so distant past be on display.  Floppy disks headgears leotards etc...  Time has not been so good to the featured stars. Ringwald and AnthonyMichael Hall who was born to play this role and this one only have all but disappeared.  The biggest stars now are blips on the screen here Joan in a headgear and John a geek  Cusack.  The film is like a toy you can't put away.Some situations are beat but at least Paul Dooley adds an extra dimension to the father.  Too many of John Hughes' teenangst comedies of the era feature tissuethin parental figures.  This was the first and best of the socalled brat pack movies and will always hold a place in 1980's filmmaking history.  Girls learned never to lend their underwear to a geek and we all learned that high school is just a phase easily forgotten as time goes on.".

Both Ringwald and Shoeffling are sitting Indianstyle on a tabletop facing one another. They both have to lean forward presumably using their wrists for leverage while their lips meet over the flaming candles on her birthday cake. A difficult kiss indeed.Sixteen Candles is one of the best films John Hughes gave us in the 1980s. The young cast full of so many extraordinary talents gives us one memorable scene after another. Anthony Michael Hall is particularly effective as the leader of the nerdiest students on campus. Listen to his voice crack as he reads many of his lines and try not to laugh. Good luck! The plot as many of us know centers around a young girl Ringwald whose parents forget about her sixteenth birthday in the midst of the chaos surrounding her older sister's wedding. At the same time she tries to win the affection of the most popular guy in school who happens to be dating the most beautiful girl in school. Ah the trials and tribulations of high school.The film is wellpaced never drags and has its characters pegged pretty well. The obnoxious grandparents are particularly welldrawn. Of course things are eventually resolved in a manner that could never possibly happen in real life but that's why we go to the movies.I miss those destructive house parties!!! 9 of 10 stars.The Hound.".

She is 3 dimensional as main characters are meant to be. She is also pretty funny and relatable. The second was the wedding scene that was pretty funny. But that's about it in terms of good stuff.Now the bad stuff. I had to watch this film for media studies and it made me feel physically sick it was a completely revolting film. Now I'm gonna tell you why there are two MAJOR issues with this film first off it is RACIST and homophobic but not as glaringly. The exchange student was there simply to add to the chaos of the household but was just walking semi stereotyped walking gag. The big rat that topped this super coated cake was believe it or not RAPE. Yep the geek character takes advantage of the drunk popular girl at a party it is not shown but the morning after she is apparently fine with it! completely unrealistic and also what the insert ten thousand super bad swear words kind of message is this sending to young people especially males. Now something else that made my blood boil was that the romantic interest was the one who suggested and helped this geek guy date rape his girlfriend. Apparently the audience is still supposed to be looking forward to seeing said guy kiss the girl. So for an alternative ending I imagined Samantha jumping in Jake's car then repeatedly running both Jake and the geek over while eating her cake. This helped me keep my lunch inside the lining of my stomach.I understand people saying to watch film in the context of the time and place they were made I certainly managed to keep that in mind when watching Rebel without a cause. However Sixteen Candles cannot be watched with this in mind it has no excuse whatsoever.so please please please do not let anyone old or young male or female ever see this film".

The big rat that topped this super coated cake was believe it or not RAPE. Yep the geek character takes advantage of the drunk popular girl at a party it is not shown but the morning after she is apparently fine with it! completely unrealistic and also what the insert ten thousand super bad swear words kind of message is this sending to young people especially males. Now something else that made my blood boil was that the romantic interest was the one who suggested and helped this geek guy date rape his girlfriend. Apparently the audience is still supposed to be looking forward to seeing said guy kiss the girl. So for an alternative ending I imagined Samantha jumping in Jake's car then repeatedly running both Jake and the geek over while eating her cake. This helped me keep my lunch inside the lining of my stomach.I understand people saying to watch film in the context of the time and place they were made I certainly managed to keep that in mind when watching Rebel without a cause. However Sixteen Candles cannot be watched with this in mind it has no excuse whatsoever.so please please please do not let anyone old or young male or female ever see this film";

I watched Sixteen Candles for the first time and i enjoyed it. I liked Pretty in Pink better though. Sixteen candles is a really funny yet in a sweet romantic sort of way....the geeks and the Duck guy hilarious! i enjoy watching classic movies eg. dirty dancing ghost gremlin pretty in pink ghost busters.... I wouldn't recommend this movie to kids 14 especially if you don't like watching classic movies. But to those out there who were teens in the 80s this might bring back your high school memories. Truly hilarious you can predict the ending the geeks took the spotlight for me".

	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers herein.Most films are about other films and few invent new stuff in the film world. So when something new comes around it is remarkable. The big deal with this film is that it DOES add something to the cinematic vocabulary that wasn't there before.It references the movies we invent and carry in our minds from high school. Fast Times at Ridgemont High' was the originator of this idea but the manner used there never caught on unless you could Kevin Smith. Here the idea is to be fantastic so amazingly so that we agree with the direction of the fantasy. It is precisely the direction we were already going with the exaggerations we play with in our own memories.A house is not just trashed by a party it is decimated and defiled. A foreign student isn't just out of touch he is from outer space and this Earth just gobbles him up. All this frantic fantasy wouldn't work without an emotional anchor. The rule of twos' says that you need a girl and a boy here Molly and Hall. These are characters who live in that chaotic mess and who you can see knowing it and devising strategies to get by.Michael Hall is terrific but Molly Ringwald interests me more. Nowadays a director would find a 20's something actress to play a teenager like dePalma had with Carrie'. Molly was actually younger than her character but understands the notion of trying to find a lighted path in a funhouse.She is only asked to do one thing here. Her subsequent career shows she is limited as an actress to this one thing but she does it so extraordinarily well it anchors the fantasy. We relate to her and use her a springboard for our own remembrances. No shrinking redhead can appear in film now without referencing her in some way. I'm thinking directly of Lauren Ambrose here.It is a touch of genius. This is her best work and that of Hughes as well. It added something something that stuck. Now many movies are about this one.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

How can it be so revered I wonder? Crude sexjokes overthetop humour cringeworthy Asian stereotypes... yikes. Most offensive is the scene where Molly's olderman crush hands his unconscious girlfriend over to The Geek and encourages him to have his way with her while she's passed out. What the hell? Is this movie actually condoning RAPE?! Unbelievable. And we're supposed to root for an innocent young girl to hook up with this creep?I know many teen comedies from the early '80s still had that '70s sensibility and nudityvulgarity was common. But I just didn't expect Porky'sstyle hijinks from John Hughes movies which are often acclaimed for their realistic portrayal of teen life. This particular film seems to get many positive reviews for being groundbreaking in it's realism. But this ain't my version of reality.I dunno maybe Sixteen Candles was at the time a step up from previous teen movies. Still it's definitely my least favorite Hughes film and I wouldn't recommend it to any impressionable youngsters out there who might pick up some very bad messages...if they have a better memory than I did.".

	schema:headline " It may look like cheesy teen romance but it was the birth of teen comedy as we know it";
	schema:reviewBody "As weird as it may sound Sixteen Candles is an important film. It's true a film about a high school girl who has a nightmarish sixteenth birthday played a significant role in shaping movie comedies as we know them today.To start with Sixteen Candles was written and directed by John Hughes. Hughes had written a couple films prior to this one for the group National Lampoon's namely the classic comedy National Lampoon's Vacation. Candles marks the directorial debut of Hughes his first complete film. Why is this of any significance? Well Hughes followed up this film a year later with a little movie called The Breakfast Club. As if that wasn't impressive enough in the 1980s Hughes produced more hit sequels to the Vacation series a movie called Ferris Bueller's Day Off and created some of the finest films of the careers of Chevy Chase and John Candy. He's the father of 80s comedy and the grandfather of comedy as we know it today.So how does this all ring true in Sixteen Candles? To start the film takes place in the span of 48 hours. That seems insignificant but how many classic teenage comedies take place in a short time span? The model even holds true with today's films like the praised Apatow Productions film Superbad. That's just one small example. The real contribution of this movie is its depiction of the teenage lifestyle. Samantha is a typical teenager with typical teenage thoughts and problems on her 16th birthday. Molly Ringwald is a name no one forgets despite her only major films being this and Breakfast Club because we see a little of our teenage selves in her candid performance. With Hughes help to create such a real concept getting neglected by her family on her birthday Ringwald communicates all those dizzying 16yearold emotions and issues like selfconfidence being misunderstood and of course hopeless romance.The comedic genius plays its way in to all the things that happen to Sam and the completely relatable andor goofy characters that surround her. The film is one of the first to take what Animal House did for college movies and apply it to the high school scene being unafraid to handle the sex and drinking and generally irresponsible behavior. While this idea has since exploded into untold number of movies both good and awful what makes it stay fresh today is that it doesn't overstereotype. There are nerds and popular girls and what have you but Hughes doesn't play up that hierarchy. Sam's love interest the seemingly unattainable Jake Ryan doesn't have jerkoff friends pressuring him not to fall for the unknown quiet girl. them coming together is the film's goal not it's plot. While the believability there isn't the film's strong suit it's not as weak and cheesed up as similar films that followed it.The best part of Sixteen Candles is how unmistakably real it is. The family drama and goofiness that plays out the story takes place the day before and of Sam's sister's wedding and the family's in town is so dead on. We all have grandparents like Sam's that treat us like they treat Sam. We all have embarrassing but necessary conversations with our parents even if we don't like seeing them on the screen either. Hughes taps into our inner or depending outer teenager with sacrificing the humor of the whole situation. If nothing else Sixteen Candles could provide anyone with a camera and some confidence to create a movie. This is proof that movies about life in the suburbs can in fact be done well.Complimented with a killer soundtrack freshmen who look like 12yearolds paying money to see women's underwear some great cars and plenty of empty cans of Old Style Sixteen Candles is classic in every sense of the word. There's no denying that it's cheesy and most of the acting is poor outside of Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall also of Breakfast Club as the socially courageous geek who is a sweetheart of a troublemaker. Oh and appearances by the young Cusacks. At the same time it's the nostalgic lost but hopeful teenage feeling the movie evokes that makes it timeless. It can't be underestimated how much of an impact this film really did have on the future of comedies.".

The scenes that were supposed to be poignant and heartfelt were instead mawkish and completely fake. Who's to believe that a handsome high school senior disillusioned by the party life would ever take a second glance at a gawky sophomore? I couldn't even bring myself to feel sorry for the main character whose constant 'woe is me' asides at the audience made me want to slap her and tell her to grow up.In all a lot of eyerolling went on. I only watched it for some hope that the film would redeem itself. It ended on the worst note possible.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is a John Hughes teen movie so even during the opening scenes many will have sketched a good idea of how Sixteen Candles will conclude. The usual archetypes are all there the prissy older sister the bratty fast talking younger brother the mopey middle child the high school power couple and so on. Hughes would build a career from these  in fact he subscribes to these roles so much that he would later cast Hall in practically the exact same role a year later in Breakfast Club as the brain or as he is constantly referred to here the geek. The two would have the climatic scene in the car where they realise they are more than their labels. Conventionally we expect that they will somehow end up together romantically after Jake is found to be less than the noble pretty boy you know the whole 'what you were looking for was right beneath your eyes' shtick. But Hughes doesn't fully commit to these expectations but flips them around winking slightly. The father is not stuffy or stuck up and remarks that it is good that his son is being educated in the areas of female sexuality albeit crudely. The whole film seems to conspire against Sam with even the grandparents forgetting her birthday. She shows a sarcastic awareness They live for that sht!.So there is decent groundwork. Hughes sprinkles these little knowing touches which are familiar and make sense the sex quizzes that teenagers pass around still all the rage these days and in the way that two jocks can only hold an even slightly indepth conversation whilst alternating on the pullup bar. Even the geeks the lowest of the low on the proverbial food chain make crude sexual wagers amongst themselves. Sexuality for them is a strange scary and curious thing and Sam's laughter is a gentle mockery of sorts transcending the boundaries of the screen. The audience too can giggle at how inexperienced they are and how they are completely ruled by these expectations of them. But we also understand and sympathise which is what Hughes is known for. The secondary character however are a different story. The queen bee is predictable enough a blonde bombshell that holds the star quarterback type in her claws and smiles sweetly to the rest of the world. But the mistake is to afford Jake the exact same personality. He knows nothing of Sam except for a little note she wrote in and the phonecalls to her grandfather whilst humorous ultimately just confirm our suspicions that this power couple is exactly as they appear shallow as a kiddy pool in both characterisation and attitude. So no one cares when they breakup amicably. The worst of the film is easily the Asian exchange student Long Duk Dong whose every word is followed by a loud and distracting gong and whose broken English hideous haircut and lack of social etiquette immediately brands him as the designated punching bag. This is not only lazy stereotyping yelling Banzai as he falls from a tree the way he flits from Chinese to Japanese but also Hughes contradicting his own mantra. Characters are more than their labels except when you need to make vulgar derogatory jokes. Dong is immediately shackled with another similar stereotype the large unattractive manbeast. The act is supposed to be eyeopening and subversive but only reinforces the respective stigmas. Even Hall lowly as he is barely gives neck brace girl a second thought. There's something very meanspirited about the whole thing.".

Early on I spent most of my time fantasizing about Jake Ryan and now I get most of my kicks from laughing at Long Duk Dong. John Hughes is by far the most talented director of all time. He has a knack for striking the chords of youth and presenting teenage material in a way that anybody can relate to. I mean how many of you can remember loathing the bus? or knowing a geek somewhat like Farmer Ted? My favorite part of the movie is when Samantha's parents and grandparents find Dong passed out on the front lawn stinking of Canine Cologne and giving grandpa a rendition of what happened to his autombile. It is too funny for words!! The party scene where Farmer Ted and his friends knock on the door and Dong answers it while hanging on the door with his legs wrapped around the frame saying come on in and party hard dudepeople his new AllAmerican girlfriend then proceeds to pick him off the door frame and carry him into the party is absolutely hilarious! The entire movie is full of humor that I can appreciate. I also could relate to the Jaws or Twilight Zonedepending on what movie version you have musical theme that played as Samantha came across her grandparents raiding her bedroom to stay for the weekend. You will laugh as her grandpa eyes her chest and says to grandmaLet me go get my magnifying glass!  And what girl doesn't love a happy ending especially with the eversohandsome Jake Ryan? If you grew up in the eighties and need a good love story or a good laugh rent this movie. Just be sure to keep an eye out for Dong because he uses his forks as chopsticks while eating his American meals.......too cute!".

	schema:headline " A striking film with a Highsmith flavor and vintage Chabrol";
	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the best Chabrol films I have seen. It's interesting to note that it's based upon a novel by Nicolas Blake pen name of C. Day Lewis at one time Poet Laureate of England and father of Daniel Day Lewis. From the movie it seems BlakeLewis was writing very much in the spirit of the great and very cinematic mistress of psychological crime writing Patricia Highsmith. Though she never wrote anything exactly like this the similarity is in the firstperson narrative of a potential murderer and in the way the story approaches an utterly evil person in an everyday upperbourgeois setting even the account of a man having an 'affair' with a woman he isn't necessarily attracted to is typically Highsmith and there's attempted murder on a sailboat and a man is almost bludgeoned on the head with a rock  Highsmith devices. The journal of the man contemplating murder which is then found out is something Highsmith might have liked.Though as some have noted the narrator finds his way to the hit and run killer of his son a little too easily the movie by allowing that is able to take us headlong into an astonishing almost shocking situation. To get so close to evil  this man who everybody hates who would kill and cover it up and make his sister collaborate who is abusive to everybody and everything yet lives in bourgeois splendor is so unusual it takes a while to realize how hairraising it is. Events move quickly after that. This is more understated than most of Chabrol and the greatest violence consists of a few slaps on the face of a lover or a boy and words of abuse hurled by a boorish man and his nasty mother but those moments are all the more disturbing for coming in such a buttonedup world and the action is very fast and economical compared to some of Chabrol's films. The scenes between the narrator and the boy Philippe where the boy says he wants his father dead and wishes MarkCharles were his father are very touching. The references to the rich variety of death descriptions in the Iliad are particularly resonant as is the one at the end to Brahms quoting Hebrew scriptures with the Brahms song sung by the great Kathleen Ferrier. The style may be neutral but the film is elegant and its look has not dated. The repugnant family scenes and the nightmarish dinners are typically Chabrol. The simplicity of the style is the more impressive seen in terms of possible followers like Ozon. They don't make them like this any more they can't.Michel Duchaussoy makes a good contrast to Yanne because he is so bland. He's an intentionally neutral figure whose moral status is meant to be ambiguous. Is he a hero out of Greek tragedy or is he just an escaping villain? Has he brought about justice  has he even done it since the son claims responsibility  or has he merely been sucked into a whirlpool of evil? In the detective's office he finally begins to look for the first time like a sensitive writer. Before that he looked like a bland actor but his opacity is just what Chabrol wants. Maybe he's one of Chabrol's most appealing heroes but in the end what are we admiring?".

	schema:headline " Brooding and interesting revenge movie from the great Claude Chabrol!";
	schema:reviewBody "Claude Chabrol made a lot of films during his career and while I've only really scratched the surface so far  I have to say that this one is right up there with his very best! Chabrol's films aren't thrillers in the same vein as those made by the likes of Alfred Hitchcock in spite of the fact that he is often known as 'The French Hitchcock' with Chabrol the thrills don't come from moments of suspense or tension but from the interest generated in the lead characters and the situation put forward and that was never truer than with this film  perhaps the most sombre revenge movie ever made! The film starts off with a young boy returning home from the beach. However his stroll is interrupted when a car comes out of nowhere and runs him down. The boy's father a man named Charles Thenier is distraught following the accident and vows to track down the man who did it. His thirst for revenge is great but his hatred towards the murderer is so immense that he decides one he finds him to befriend and lure him into a false sense of security before killing him...Since there's not a great deal of excitement in the visceral sense it may seem on the surface that This Man Must Die does not do its job as a thriller. However this couldn't be further from the truth. Chabrol's film is brooding and intriguing throughout and has a great sense of realism in the way that the wronged father goes after the man who killed his son. It has to be said that the film somewhat hinges on coincidence but this is actually addressed within the film itself and the events that take place are largely logical. Once again Chabrol's production values are high and the film is incredibly beautiful and it bodes well with the sober tone of the movie. The acting is fantastic with Michel Duchaussoy doing well in the lead role and receiving excellent feedback from the lovely Caroline Cellier and the brilliant Jean Yanne who steals every scene he's in as the villain of the piece. The film boils down to an excellent conclusion that both comes as something of a surprise and adds some Greek tragedy into the mix. Overall this is another big success for the great French director and comes highly recommended!".

	schema:reviewBody "A car runs over the boy Michel Thenier while he is crossing the street in his calm village in Bretane and the hit and run driver flees without any witness. His grieving father Charles Thenier Michel Duchaussoy becomes obsessed to find the reckless driver that murdered his only son to kill him and spends his time writing his diary and running his own investigation in garages and junkyards. One day he learns by chance that the actress Helene Lanson Caroline Cellier might be the responsible for the death of Michel. Charles travels to Paris posing as screenplay writer introduces himself using his pseudonym of Marc Andrieux and seduces Helene with the intention of killing her. However Helene tells that her family is from Brittany and her brotherinlaw Paul Decourt Jean Yanne owns a garage in Quimper. When Helene invites Charles to travel to her sister's house to know her family Charles finds that Paul is a despicable man with a disease in the intestine hated by his family and his own son Phillippe Decourt Marc Di Napoli wants to kill him. Que la Bte Meure a.k.a. This Man Must Die is an ambiguous story of hatred and revenge with an open conclusion where it is not clear who really killed the detestable Paul Decourt. The odyssey of Charles to find the killer proves that he is a manipulative and Machiavellian man therefore it is impossible to conclude what is his final destination. One point that intrigues me and may be a clue to the truth is when Paul calls Marc by Charles when they are preparing to sail. Neither Claude Chabrol nor Charles Thenier would be capable to commit such mistake and then in the boat Charles tells to Paul that the entertaining is just beginning. This sequence corroborates with the deduction of the detective and associated to the profile of Charles that should be incapable to neglect his journal may indicate that Phillippe is really innocent but I can not assure that my interpretation is correct. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Not Available".

	schema:headline " The makings of Greek tragedy but Chabrol has more up his sleeve in revenge flick";
	schema:reviewBody "In taking a slight cue from Alfred Hitchcock one of Chabrol's heroes but going another step further This Man Must Die follows a logical turn of events for a single father who's son is run over in a hit and run by some cruel man in a fast car. In Hitchcock's hands this might be led by elegant stars have even moments of scathing wit. But Chabrol's vision is a little darker more that is seething under this surface with the bourgeois as much of the commonplace as just the backdrop for the theater of revenge about to take place. But like the old master Chabrol takes a twist with the material as the father Charles Thenier going by an alias as a writer of children's books gets more than acquainted with a woman who is the sisterinlaw of the killer gets to know the family more and gets to know slimy shrewd businessman and bigtime garage owner Paul Decourt more he's not really the only one out for his head.As Chabrol goes further it becomes a tale of Greek tragedy or some variation on it. Paul's son Philippe a character as played by jean Yanne as if almost out of Bresson hates his father with a passion as his father has no respect for or tries to encourage his son with what he's got going on at school perhaps conventionally every scene with the father and son is a tense and violent outburst from father towards innocent son. One might think a collaboration might happen between the secretive diarywriting Charles and the kind but frustrated kid but this too isn't that simple. Chabrol also takes a smart tactic with that diary of Charles's it could be just a narrative gimmick and at times it feels as just that maybe one of the film's only drawbacks if only only on but it does start to probe into a mindset that is onetrack and not without some reason in the genre sense. We're pitted on Charles's side as he sneaks his way into Helen's heart and then through her sometimes nice and other times i.e. Paul's mother savage in their verbal brutality.But this same diary works as a something of a stepup from a psychological MacGuffin. Chabrol twists around with plot into motivation and he pulls it off with his shooting and editing style which applies just small precise touches of the good old French New Wave into the proceedings the occasional jumpcut as any filmmaker knows can't hurt under the right circumstances. What Chabrol's brilliant achievement is to transcend the trappings of a revenge film and to explore what the nature of malevolence brings past a simple crime certainly these bastards have families if they have the capacity to clear up their crimes with such skill like an owner of a hugely profitable autobodygarage and at the same time put a human angle into a plot that requires it. The actors do what they can the man playing Charles who I have not seen in other films is very good in the lead as is in his own right the man playing Paul Decourt adding some layers to this rotten being and despite some clunky scenes that do have to deal with the plot there's some wit thrown in under the surface It's not a needle in a haystack more like a needle in a box of needles.If This Man Must Die isn't a great film and I'm not sure it is it is at least a very successful example of finding some of the cracks in a revenge mystery of adding that superlative mix of character into plot and seeing what makes things like a diary or a slip off a cliff or an ambiguous ending tick.".

It does not directly concern the murderousness of bourgeois marriage although it deals with that too.  Most radically we gain access to the main character's emotions and motivations revealed through diary entries  usually Chabrol's characters reveal themselves through action or reaction and then motives are often obscure.These are only really differences if we read Chabrol's film literally superficially which it is always fatal to do.  The status of this diary must be questioned especially when it moves outside the narrative explaining Charles's motives into it as it becomes a barrier to his achieving a revenge and is the only piece of evidence against him.  We remember that he is a writer in a sense he creates the narrative the film we are watching  he lives his life like a plot with heroes villains romance and catharsis.  In this way like so many Chabrol heroes and villains he is linked to the director at one point he stands by his homemovie camera a voyeur an intruder while his lover is an actress.  He writes childrens' books  as in many Chabrol films 'Bete' is about the death of innocence the film opens with the killing of a child a second child is abused by his father to the point of contemplating murder.  And yet even when his son is killed Charles wants to make believe it didn't happen wants to live a different story.So the film is full of stories centred on brought together and interpreted by Charles.  In another 'story' concluding the film his letter to Helen he explains these stories their purpose even the meaning of the title as he does so he is effacing himself escaping France the past his identity. The Greek and religious elements structuring so many Chabrol films are made overt here the equation complete in this most mathematical of films that began with such a terrifying sum  or a law of physics with two contrary principles colliding.And yet the last third is a babble of so many conflicting stories we don't know who or what to believe how to filter lies from truths.  This centres on the diary its status as personal testimony confession coldblooded plan or an author's fiction.  The neatness with which Charles' plot is tied up as much as how it is engendered the 'coincidence' of Paul's car getting stuck on a country lane defies credibility and the move from grim revenge thriller to hilarious bourgeoisbaiting cartoon comedy is disarming to say the least.  Is this simply a moving film about grief about the patterns and fictions we create to help cope with what is essentially meaningless and horrifying?  After all if the beast must die so must the man  and Chabrol like his hero Hitchcock is obsessed with doubles.This narrative duplicity is matched in a rare Chabrol film of this period by a dour naturalism verging on ugliness with deep muddy colours and harsh landscapes as pitiless as the revenger's quest.  Yet another endlessly fascinating enigma from Chabrol.".

This centres on the diary its status as personal testimony confession coldblooded plan or an author's fiction.  The neatness with which Charles' plot is tied up as much as how it is engendered the 'coincidence' of Paul's car getting stuck on a country lane defies credibility and the move from grim revenge thriller to hilarious bourgeoisbaiting cartoon comedy is disarming to say the least.  Is this simply a moving film about grief about the patterns and fictions we create to help cope with what is essentially meaningless and horrifying?  After all if the beast must die so must the man  and Chabrol like his hero Hitchcock is obsessed with doubles.This narrative duplicity is matched in a rare Chabrol film of this period by a dour naturalism verging on ugliness with deep muddy colours and harsh landscapes as pitiless as the revenger's quest.  Yet another endlessly fascinating enigma from Chabrol.";

The impact jolts the woman who lets out a horrible scream but the man couldn't care less about what he has done.Charles Thenier the father of the dead boy Michel is shattered by the discovery of his dead son. He goes into a deep grief ordering to get rid of the boy's possessions. On a visit to the house in Brittany he questions the old servant if she discarded everything but she breaks down and tells him she couldn't part with Michel's toys. Charles vows to avenge Michel's death. He will not stop before he finds and kills the person who caused the tragedy. Charles begins to write all his findings in a diary that he fills with details about the murder.Just by accident Charles learns about the woman who was a passenger in the car. She happens to be an actress and he follows her. It's easy for him to fake he is in love with her. Charles who has begun a diary about his findings is interested in knowing all about this beautiful woman. Helen tells Charles about a sister that lives in Brittany. As it turned out her sister lives not far from his own town. As Helen thinks her involvement with Charles is getting serious she invites him to go with her to visit her sister and her family.Helen's sister is married to Paul Decourt a boorish man who makes fun of his wife's artistic temperament. Paul who owns a large garage fits the description of the killer of Michel. Charles finds an ally in Phillippe Decourt the son of Paul an intense young man who is ridiculed by his own father. Charles who has planned to take Paul for a boat ride in order to kill him but he finds a formidable foe. Decourt tells him he has given the diary in which Charles has written his feelings about Paul Decourt. As Helen and Charles are driving back to Paris they are surprised to learn about Paul's death by poisoning and they go back.When confronted by the police inspector Charles tells all he knows but his interrogator doesn't believe in what he has to say or his alibi. It seems that Charles contributed to the suspicion that now falls on him as the possible murderer when he had nothing to do with it. When Phillippe confesses about doing his father in it appears he is covering for Charles. The last scenes of the film have a calming effect as we see Charles in his boat in the middle of the sea sailing to an unknown destination.Claude Chabrol is an excellent adapter of other people's material. This film is based on a Nicholas Blake novel we read some time ago. As he did with Ruth Rendell's A Judgment in Stone he wrote a magnificent screen treatment of this complex novel. Chabrol is not interested in keeping the killer's identity from his audience. We know throughout the narrative who was the one responsible for young Michel's death yet there is suspense in watching Charles preparing for his revenge carefully.Jean Yanne who was seen in Chabrol's Le Boucher returns as Paul Decourt a far more colorful character without any redeeming qualities. Michel Dushaussoy who plays Charles goes from the despair at the start of the film into a quiet man who is biding his time to do the right thing to avenge his son. Mark DiNapoli is another asset to the film. He is a calculating young man who hates his father and sees in Charles a kind soul that shows him the attention he never got from his old man. Caroline Cellier appears as Helen Lanson a beautiful woman who falls in love with Charles. Raymone who plays Paul Decourt's mother has two great scenes in which she reveals her true nature she is just the female version of her son. Maurice Pialat the director is seen as a police inspector.The musical score is by Dominique Zardi who also has a small part in the film. Brittany's landscape is captured by Jean Rabier. The film is one of Claude Chabrol's best directorial efforts.".

Michel Duchaussoy is looking to find the hit and run driver who killed his son and has almost no clues to assist him. However after a little searching the first important clue is almost magically given to him! Now if you ignore this inconsistency the rest of the film is great. This silly clue leads him to the passenger in the carwho turns out to be a rather decent person though you must admit she is very weak because she let the driver bully her into silence. Duchaussoy initially fakes interest in this woman to find out if SHE was the driver or if she would reveal who it was though along the way is seems he really does being to fall for her. VERY slowly he is able to gather that the driver was her brotherinlaw. A little bit later they get an invitation to stay at the sister and brotherinlaw's home and he is eager to go and confront the murderer.Fortunately for Duchaussoy the man is completely horrid in almost every way unlike the sweet girlfriend. It's easy to hate him and want revengeheck almost everyone around this man wanted him dead it seems. However revenge isn't something rushed and along the way he gets to know the familyparticularly the decent but woefully abused son of the murderer. One of the most poignant scenes in the film is when this boy comments that he wishes his father was dead and would like to have Duchaussoy for a dad instead.Finally the hero plans to drown the evil murderer since the villain hates water and apparently can't swim. However when they are out on the rough seas the jerk informs him that he found and read Duchaussoy's diary and KNOWS he's planning on killing him so he gave the book to his lawyer JUST IN CASE! Well the plot is over and Duchaussoy and his girlfriend are thrown out of the house. BUT Duchaussoy is happy and goes out to celebratepresumably because he can now prove who the murderer is. At the restaurant where he is celebrating the TV news reports that the killer was himself poisoned and the police were looking for Duchaussoy. Duchaussoy returns and is the prime suspect. BUT considering that there is the diary that discusses his plans to kill the man police are unwilling to arrest him because the diary was now known to allplus nearly everyone had a motive for killing him! Well at the very end the police inspector reasons that Duchaussoy STILL is the murderer. However the dead man's son then admits to killing his father with rat poison. However in the next scene he leaves his lady friend a note admitting he REALLY was the man who was the killer. HOWEVER the way this was done where it appears Duchaussoy is about to kill himself and the strong possibility that he only finally admitted to the killing because he cared for the boy and wanted to provide him with an alibi are brilliant. This uncertainty and the plot twists really made the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Que La Bete Meure aka The Beast Must Die  This Man Must Die is an absorbing thriller about a man who following the death of his son in a hitandrun accident decides to track down the killer and execute him.

	schema:reviewBody "Claude Chabrol passed away this September. Considered the French Hitchcock  but the same was said of HenriGeorges Clouzot  this director made countless mysteries and thrillers and worked with many fine actors during his prolific career. One of his most famous movies is The Beast Must Die which I've watched in his honour.The movie opens with a panoramic shot of a beautiful beach in Brittany where a lonely boy catches mussels by the sea. Then it cuts to a mustang driving at a reckless speed. After a few scenes cutting back and forth between the boy and the mustang they finally meet in a hitandrun accident that leaves the boy dead. Chabrol' talent for creating atmosphere is evident from the start giving the scenes with the boy a deadly calm whereas the speeding mustang is accompanied by tragic music. He also demonstrates subtlety in showing violence. A lingering shot of the boy's chalk outline with a stain of blood says everything about the monstrous crime.The boy's father Charles Thenier Michel Duchaussoy vows revenge. In a little black notebook he writes down in dramatic red ink of the failures of the police investigation to track down the driver and of his own investigation which through intuition persistence and chance leads him to an actress who was in the mustang. Pretending to be a screenwriter he gets close to Helen Lanson Caroline Cellier and after ascertaining her innocence  he was ready to kill her if she had been at the wheel  he pretends to fall in love with her in order to get close to the driver.Paul Decourt the driver Jean Yanne is a rich man and completely loathsome hated by his entire family except by his mother who's as nasty as him. He insults his son and wife flirts with women in front of her and reads her embarrassingly bad poetry at dinner in front of guests. This caricature of an evil man as Charles lovely puts it in his notebook is so nasty even his son wants to kill him and he and Charles even talk about it.The story moves in a languorous pace towards its thriceshattering conclusion. The last fifteen minutes must have more twists than the runtime that precedes them. They spring naturally from the story however and don't exist just to wow the viewer like is commonly done in contemporary thrillers. It all begins when Charles takes Decourt for a boat ride to drown him in an accident and the first of many surprises is waiting for our protagonist and us viewers.For a revenge movie The Beast Must Die is surprisingly calm if we judge it by the frantic pace of movies like Oldboy and Kill Bill. Charles writes in his notebook that revenge is something that must be slowly savoured. Charles takes his time insinuating himself in Decourt's family building friendships and developing his relationship with Helen. Duchaussoy does a great job portraying his character without ostentatious displays of emotions. He's reserved patient and precise.Jean Yanne who plays a very onedimensional evil character does the best he can with him. But whether Yanne contributes anything of himself to make Decourt so despicable or whether it's all in the screenplay already is a difficult question to answer. If I can point out a flaw in this enjoyable movie is that it has a very blackandwhite vision of revenge. There are villains we love and villains we hate to love and then there are those we just hate from the first scene they're in.Nevertheless even if its moral simplicity might offend our modern cynical attitude The Beast Must Die remains a brilliant exercise in tension and coldblooded revenge.".

	schema:reviewBody "It may take six months writes Charles Thenier in a diary he has begun or one or two years but I'll find him. I'll make friends with him. I'll wait patiently. When he's trapped I'll look at him with a smile directly in the eye. And I'll make him deserve his death. Thenier a widower has just seen his young son killed by a hitandrun driver. The car was speeding through the narrow streets struck the boy and didn't pause. When the police cannot find the driver Thenier Michel Duchaussey is determined to do so himself. Then he'll kill the driver. This Man Must Die is one of Claude Chabrol's most elegant and tensest thrillers with a conclusion that some might find ambiguous but which I found sad but emotionally satisfying. Thenier begins his search with a description of the car. He visits every garage he can think of. Almost by chance he learns of a car that had a fender repaired by the man who most likely was driving the car the man who owns a repair garage. Thenier arranges a chance meeting with the other person in the car the actress Helen Lanson Caroline Celler whose brotherinlaw he finally learns was the driver. He seduces her and then arranges to accompany her for a few days visit to the man's home in Brittany near the coast. Paul Decourt Jean Yanne is the man and his wife is Helen's sister. Decourt and his wife have a teenaged son Phillippe Marc Di Napoli. Paul Decourt is a loathsome bully. If anyone should believe in evil Decourt would be an example. He's not just loud coarse and contemptuous of others. He amuses himself by humiliating his wife in public and dominating his son. He beds the maid and his partner's wife openly. He ignores anyone's feelings and opinion's but his own. His wife is intimidated...and his son wants him dead. During the time Thenier spends in Decourt's home he comes to know Phillippe and the boy can sense that Thenier wants to kill Decourt too. Lovers often hesitate Thenier writes in the diary not out of shyness but to prolong their awaiting happiness. I full of hatred am savoring what awaits me. His killing will only be a gesture of a man throwing away the used peel of a fruit slowly enjoyed to the pit. Ah yes...the diary. Decourt discovers it and keeps it and a crucial question is whether or not Thenier set him up to find it. What at first was an obsessed and understandable pursuit of revenge and murder on the part of Charles Thenier now also is complicated by Phillippe's own determination. The diary may be Thenier's outlet for his thoughts but it also could be a clever tool of selfprotection. What we know for sure is that Decourt shortly after dies in agony. The police investigate and decide Thenier is probably the number one suspect. Yet when Phillippe intervenes we're not so sure. We're left with a satisfying tale of revenge and retribution but also of sacrifice and of a kind of morality. After all once a person has exacted his revenge what's left? The title of the movie comes from Ecclesiastes by way of Brahms titled Vier Ernste Gesange. Here's a part worth thinking about... For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts as the one dieth so dieth the other yea they have all one breath so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast for all is vanity. All go unto one place all are of the dust and all turn to dust again.".

	schema:reviewBody "Following a number of fairly mediocre efforts from the early to late sixties Chabrol got right back on track with the excellent Le Biches and followed that film with Que la bte meure an intensely involving revenge drama with the emphasis on psychology and character over action and violence.The film opens like any revenge thriller would albeit probably bettershot and acted than most of them with a child being killed in a hit and run and his father vowing to track down and kill the perpetrator. The tale slowly becomes more and more psychological however and ends up being a variation on a Greek tragedy as others have noted. Chabrol is rarely content with following the expected routine when he is his films can be dismal and Que la bte meure is far from routine as we end up spending more than an hour with the all the main characters in place and even together most of the time. The script is carefully written to avoid plot issues outside of the contrived and silly first clue the main character gets I can't think of any major issues I had with the script and the dialogue is as deliberately orchestrated as Chabrol's direction is building the suspense and drama gradually.After the nearly continuous camera motion in Les Biches Chabrol takes a different approach to this film. It's less stylized and more natural with the shot composition never feeling contrived as it sometimes did in Chabrol's immediately preceding effort although there is some very good and very deliberate work around when we first meet the villain. Chabrol also uses closeups to great effect particularly in the scene late in the film with Paul and Charles on a sail boat.What is striking about Que la bte meure is that while it deliberately builds suspense it also refuses to work as a thriller and this is most clearly seen towards the end of the film when we get the standard twists but they're so subtle and lowkey that one barely pays attention to them. The plot doesn't really matter here the film is about much more about the moral implications of revenge about the nature of man and it does well to apply these preoccupations to its characters so that we are never far removed from the emotions they are going through in particular the main character Charles played by Michel Duchaussoy.After a string of disappointing features the last two years of the sixties saw two strong efforts from Claude Chabrol which helped keep him as relevant to cinema as he is. Que la bte meure is not a perfect film and it may not even necessarily be a great film although I think it qualifies but it is engaging and enjoyable and far from empty. It leaves one thinking about it well after it has finished playing.8.510".

As Charles' struggles with the idea of killing him he must deal with the fact that he may be falling in love with Helen.The revenge film is a subgenre that has been done to death. Lazy film makers and the generally uninspired can see it as a relatively simplistic premise that can be tampered with and altered to an endless degree. They range from the genuinely brilliant Memento Oldboy The Virgin Spring to the genuinely horrific Taken Death Wish and the exploitation genre made very grisly use of it The Last House On The Left Thriller  A Cruel Picture. The fact is that it's starting to get a bit boring. Which makes it all the more refreshing when you stumble upon a gem from the past that takes the idea and spins out something fresh.

But does this mean that he truly deserves to die? As Charles sets in motion his plan of murder he becomes noticeably uncomfortable yet fiercely determined.Chabrol's filmmaking style comes across as mixing the tensionbuilding thrills of Alfred Hitchcock with the philosophical ponderings of Ingmar Bergman and the result is often astonishing. Charles almost mirrors the doomed film noir detective with Duchaussoy putting in a fantastic performance. From this to La Femme Infidele the other Chabrol film I've had the fortune to see it seems that he is relatively uncelebrated compared to his French associates Godard Truffaut Renoir and Cocteau amongst many others which on the basis of this film alone is wholly unfair.www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "When we head into Claude Chabrol's 1969 French revenge thriller The Beast Must Die and observe within the opening scene the young son of man Charles Thenier tragically struck down by a driver going far too fast in his sports car we assume the labelling of the titular 'beast' to be of the sort that sees the film's lead attribute the particular tag to him because of what he's done. In a blind rage this mysterious and unknown killer whom is not brought to justice has we presume to have been formulated as a kind of deathly monstrous and animallike persona by that of the grieving Charles as he embarks on his quest for revenge. What later transpires is in fact that the titular beast is close to all but as literal to the title and was not merely a representative word for the sort of mythical image the lead had formulated within his own mind. This in itself brings about further complications and more studious nuances the film might not have had when it comes to resonate later in the story. It is one of a number of clever twists and engaging turns director Chabrol implants onto us throughout his mediation on vengeance and the grieving process Que la Bte Meure coming to represent a really finely crafted thrillercomemediative piece on the thirst for blood in order to bring about parity.Michel Duchaussoy plays Charles the film beginning on his small boy playing alone on an empty beach before leaving for some stone steps which lead up to ground level. Tragically ground level is public road level and a sports car harbouring the titular beast as well as a young woman later transpiring to be Caroline Cellier's actress named Helene Lanson knocks Master Thenier down to the tune of a funerallike orchestral score amidst an empty street and a pretty desolate looking coastal town. Nobody saw the act nobody can help and the police seem disinterested at the best of times all the ingredients Charles needs to move off into an incarnate scociopathic rage leading to the taking of the law into his own hands. The first half of brooding menace as Charles struggles with the reality of the situation is really well captured by Chabrol grief and anger combining into a dangerous cocktail as our lead narrates to us what it is he'll do if he comes face to face with the killer by making notes in a diary providing us with a measure of the hatred and resentment. On another occasion small nuances such as the entering of a room and recognising that a glass cabinet needs repairing and it's probably the first time he's noticed this since 'the event' offer simplistic but stark insights into a frustrated and grieving mind as he little things just seem to resonate more and bother him.Charles' operating outside of the law leads him to solve things and deduce things the police otherwise do not a journeying through the countryside leads to the getting stuck in a patch of mud on the road which in turn propels him towards the woman whom was in the car that fateful day. When he eventually catches up with Helene the thrill of the chase beginning to mutate into the joy of the kill appearing to rear itself within Charles as that promise seemingly nears something Chabrol catches with a certain amount of guile during Charles' use of a faked name and his narration highlighting to us how much he detests Helene despite the on screen action being of a polar opposite in its politeness and friendliness. Chabrol places a chess set within Helene's place of dwelling after Charles has effectively enough seduced her into thinking he's rathera fan of her work drinks and socialising lead on to certain bonds the waking up in the morning after a night together seeing the chess pieces in this indelible game of catandmouse the lead has going on with everyone now scattered and confused nicely echoing the overall situation regarding Charles' stance as a scattered new order makes itself known and the lovemaking to the woman beside the driver of the car which killed his son causing this.The new order sees Charles garner further access to the prospect of carrying out his mouthwatering denouement the titular beast none other than a certain Paul Decourt played by Jean Yanne a man with a large family and stately house on the coast in which he rules with rathera hateful fist of iron. The building up to Decourt's big reveal sees Charles first having to interact with his extensive family the destroying of one man seemingly the symptomatic destroying of all of this largescale family unit consisting of rather nice and rather intelligent people. Chabrol dangerously even agonisingly tempts us to side with the lead and will him on to kill Decourt his attitudes and the way he treats these people sitting around the table positively shocking the sense that they themselves have wished for some while that harm might come to him clearly present.The film is sharp enough to refrain from rendering Decourt the greater extent or larger representation of anything more sordid it is not as if the lead is suddenly fighting a extensive portrayal of evil in the form of child pornography rings corrupt police officials or domestic abusers as seen in other such revenge thrillers including 1971's Get Carter or 1999's Payback. Rather Decourt remains grounded the biggest crime he is guilty of outside of the hitandrun is oafishness but that is never a crime punishable by death. Instead Chabrol's film darts along at its own studious pace a later study in duality between Dacourt's son Phillippe Di Napoli as the male child Charles no longer has and Charles as the father Phillippe should have had growing up given ample attention. The film is a rather unnerving but humanely played revenge thriller rich in substance and certainly worth checking out.".

So Mallory and Miller being the only ones who can positively identify him are sent along with a unit called Force 10 which is led by Colonel Barnsby who objects to their presence. It seems that Force 10 has a mission of their own which Mallory and Miller know nothing about. When their plane is shot and most of the team is killed they mistakenly believe that some of the locals they meet are Partisans but in reality are German Allies so they are taken prisoner and have to convince the German commander that they are not spies or else they will be killed.";

	schema:reviewBody "If you love the Guns Of Navarone as one of the greatest and more importantly most literate WWII action films of all time then this sequel is really going to cause some painful moments and I wouldn't recommend watching the two films backtoback under any circumstances.   Owing to the fact that it took original Guns producer Carl Foreman a decade to get the Force 10 film project off the ground Gregory Peck and David Niven were both  Social Security eligible by the time the film was ready to go and that meant we'd have to see a new cast.  And for the most part despite the borrowing of footage of the first film's climax at the beginning you might as well watch this film pretending the first one never happened.   The Nicolai connection to the first film is weak and barely explored and we probably could have done without that plotline altogether.  And whereas Guns was deadly serious in tone filled with some rich character studies and literate exploration of the moral questions that get raised even when fighting a good cause Force 10 is really more of an escapist war film punctuated with moments of light comedy and with no depth whatsoever in the characters and script.  If one is willing to accept the film on that level then it can be enjoyed as an entertaining diversion but no more.   It is interesting to see Harrison Ford in his first postStar Wars role working alongside the great Robert Shaw in his last film and Edward Fox appears to emulate most of David Niven's mannerisms quite well.   Carl Weathers though was an annoying distraction and the scene where he demanded answers while the enemy was approaching was just plain dumb.   By it's very title though Force 10 is always going to have the problem of it's magnificent predecessor hanging over it.  Too bad the sequel possibility wasn't cashed in on sooner when Peck Niven and Quinn could have still done their parts I always hoped they'd lead a new mission to rescue Anthony Quayle!".

To get there they are attached to Force 10 led by Col. Barnsby who have their own mission to destroy a vital bridge. From the outset things go wrong as they steal a Lancaster from an airfield in Termoli are joined by Sgt. Weaver escaping US MP's then get shot down bail out and are captured by Chetniks who are loyal to the Germans.   By the time this sequel to 'The Guns Of Navarone' was made 17 years had passed. Gregory Peck and David Niven were too old to reprise their roles so Robert Shaw and Edward Fox took over. Harrison Ford fresh from 'Star Wars' played Col. Barnsby Franco Nero signed on as Nikolai and Richard Kiel Barbara Bach and Carl Weathers all came from recent box office hits  the former two from 'The Spy Who Loved Me' the latter from 'Rocky'. Guy Hamilton was hired to direct Goldfinger Battle of Britain Live and Let Die etc.   This film has been much maligned over the years somewhat unfairly. It could never hope to emulate its predecessor and therefore takes a different approach. While 'Guns' had a taut serious tone this adopts a more tongue in cheek feel. Some of the interplay between Shaw and Fox is quite deadpan and amusing with the actors obviously not taking proceedings too seriously. Harrison Ford looks uneasy at the start but settles into his role as things progress. The use of the stunning Yugoslavian countryside gives the film a unique feel and it appears to have had a decent budget. The score harks back to the type of Boys Own adventures that were so popular a decade earlier.    There are some flaws yes. Possibly more tension could have been injected at some points and Mallory seems to have lost the ability to speak fluent German since 'Guns'. It's not in the same league as that film or the marvellous 'Where Eagles Dare' but it's an enjoyable way to pass a couple of hours on a cold wet winters' night.".

Honestly I think Force 10 from Navarone was more fastpaced actionpacked and hilarious as it's predecessor The Guns of Navarone but then it also lacks the stronger elements that made its predecessor better. But it seems unfair to compare a sequel to its predecessor when the film is a sequel in name only. Other than the opening which retracks the memorable final scenes from the original FORCE 10 FROM NAVARONE mostly flies solo. The cast was excellent. Robert Shaw and Edward Fox are good replacements to Gregory Peck and David Niven in the roles of Keith Mallory and Major Miller. Harrison Ford absolutely amazing as Lt. Col. Barnsby. Carl Weathers is usually out of place but he's fine enough. While Barbara Bach and Richard Kiel offer fine performances after their roles in The Spy Who Loved Me.There will be a few hate remarks from fans of the original but seeing it as not a sequel to the classic film and more of a film that uses 'Guns' as its inspiration this sequel is fun exciting and occasionally excellent.

Also Robert Shaw good in anything and Edward Fox have a great rapport trading lines with impeccable timing.

Harrison Ford gives a solid performance as a young overachieving officer helping the subplot of the new blood clashing with the old veterans. Barbara Bach is beautiful but not much other reason for her to be around. Carl Weathers actually gives a nice performance as the rebellious black soldier implausibly brought along by weirdly improbable circumstances. Facing the fact that the Armed Forces were segregated during WWII it seems like the makers wanted to have a black included in the movie and had to make up some way to do that coming up with a ridiculously contrived way to have him along.  It's unfortunate they couldn't come up with something better because though Weathers is likable and his character brings something to the party they way they did it undermines the plotline.The action is okay though the payoff at the end clever as it is ultimately fails because of the special effectsthey just weren't that well done they seemed like they came from a grade b movie. If you've seen some WWII movies like A Bridge Too Far Kelly's Heros Battle of the Bulge the Devil's Brigade or Where Eagles Dare and liked them definitely give this one a try.

Robert Shaw From Russia With Love is the star. Barbara Bach The Spy Who Loved Me is a love interest. Even Richard Kiel Jaws in The Spy Who Loved Me is here as a heavy. Unfortunately this film is not as enjoyable as a typical Bond film not to mention equaling or surpassing the Gregory Peck classic The Guns of Navarone to which it is a followup. The film is not an entire waste however. A young Harrison Ford is very convincing action star even here and is almost enough to save this disappointing effort. The only really gripping part of this film was the racial tension between Keil's character and Carl Weather's Predator character. Average film 610. This review was based on the widescreen version on the DVD which had a few extra minutes.".

Thrilling and rousing film is set about two years after the events of Guns of Navarone  in which a valiant and skilled trio  Harrison FordRobert ShawEdward Fox  is dispatched to a dangerous mission during World War II in Yugoslavia . This powerful  dramatic story from the Alistair McLean novel starts when the commanding staff assigns a mission to several oddly assorted military experts as Mallory  now been promoted to the rank of Major played by Robert Shaw in this sequel and was his last film completed  he was called Captain Jack Mallory  in the original was played there by Gregory Peck and Miller who has now been promoted to the rank of Sergeant played by Edward Fox who replaced Ian Bannen here was called Corporal Dusty Miller  in the original performed by David Niven . They are teamed to discover a traitor and destroy a bridge vital to enemy strategy . The outfit must destroy a huge dam and a bridge that threaten the Allied . To do so  they must sneak throughout the Nazis' noses disguised as German soldiers.It is one of the most thrilling and moving films set on the years of the Second World War . This interesting wartime picture contains highpowered actionpacked  shootouts  explosions  floods  mass slaughter and lots of fun . Fairly decent acting by the starstudded  a traditional allcast  this Box office hit is a funny  exciting WWII actioner . Common production personnel who worked on or were credited for both this movie sequel and the original The Guns of Navarone included novelist Alistair MacLean  producerscriptwriter Carl Foreman production designer Geoffrey Drake editor Raymond Poulton and production supervisor  production accountant Sidney G. Barnsby . Highlighted by a stirring and thrilling climax with overwhelming action scenes proceeded by a good technician and artistic team. The picture is well set in Yugoslavia and results to be a great superproduction with allstarcast  impressive scenes  shimmer photography and a vibrant sound  the time has increased its value  despite its releasing was panned by critics . The acting of the interesting characters is believable and convincing  furthermore and enjoyable support cast as Carl Weathers  Franco Nero  Alan Badel  Michael Byrne and it's one of three movies all made during the midlate 1970s that actress Barbara Bach and actor Richard Kiel both appeared  it includes The humanoid  Spy who loved me and Force 10 . Director Guy Hamilton uses a clip from his earlier film Battle of England when the Messerschmitt attacks the Lancaster bomber and the socalled German Panzer tanks shown at the end of the movie are actually Soviet T34s  a medium tank produced from 1940 to 1958 . The screenplay has eloquent dialogue  humor  doublecrosses  continuous tension and surprising twists that keep the viewer's attention . Sweeping wartime movie epic from the director of 'James Bond's Goldfinger' presents the historic events of hokey manner but it does so fascinatingly . All in allit's a successful piece of warlike fluff. Although overlong has good battle footage  solid acting  breathtaking scenes which help offset a sometimes farfetched plot but suffers on television  as the small screen damages its really spectacular images. The soundtrack by French composer Maurice Jarre  Jean Michel Jarre's father  is full of vibrant sound  brings a solemn score cutting edge played by an orchestra of wind . Colorful cinematography in glimmer color by Christopher Challis  being filmed on location in Jersey Channel Islands  Mediterranean Film Studios Malta  studio Montenegro  Plymouth Docks Plymouth Devon EnglandShepperton Studios Shepperton Surrey England UK . Guy Hamilton' filmmaking is absorbent and entertaining  a good job  and the production shoot for this movie went for sixteen weeks . Rating  good but inferior to original  wholesome seeing . This picture should please most actionwaradventure buffs.Interesting screenplay by Robin Chapman based on a novel by Alistair MacLean . He wrote many bestselling action novels that were turned into often successful movies. When asked to comment on why his stories were so popular he remarked that he always wrote stories that were visual. Since they were easy to imagine when the books were read they were easy to film . This flick is one of several movies based on an Alistair MacLean novels set in rugged battles during WWII  the first was  Guns of Navarone  after that  it would be  When eagles dare by Brian H Hutton . And subsequently post World War and Cold War as Bear Island by Don Sharp and River of death by Steve Carver  in addition  two adaptations directed by John Sturges  Ice Station Zebra  The Satan Bug.".

While hardly a masterpiece of cinema Force 10 is a wellpaced war adventurebuddy picture that doesn't take itself too seriously and really tries it's best to entertain the audience. It's just an awful lot of FUN.The plot concerns a mismatched group of commandos who are sent into Nazioccupied Yugoslavia in order to kill a very elusive enemy agent and destroy a strategically vital bridge. There are lots of enjoyable plot twists and the action scenes are very wellstaged. Given that this was released in 1978 the special effects are decent too.By 1970s standards the cast is also pretty highpowered including Robert Shaw R.I.P a postHan Solo Harrison Ford Seventies uberbabe Barbara Bach and the wonderful Edward Fox as the aristocratically eccentric explosives expert Miller definitely my favorite character in the film. If you are looking for deep and meaningful ponderings on the nature of war and suchlike then go someplace else. If you want a topnotch WW2 popcorn movie then you really can't do much better than this. BTW the original book by Alistair MacLean is a good read also.".

These 'specialists' are nothing of the kind and seem to belong to a movie like Stripes or Police Academy.

Despite a big budget and a great cast Force 10 From Navarone will probably go down as one of the worst films of Harrison Ford's career.";

	schema:reviewBody "Everything that can go wrong for the heroesdoes go wrong for themin Goldfinger director Guy Hamilton's Force 10 from Navarone an aboveaverage atmospheric 10million dollar World War II tale of espionage and adventure based on Alistair MacLean's exciting bestseller. Remember MacLean wrote Where Eagles Dare. Unfortunately Force 10 from Navarone isn't as superlative as its source novel and many of its problems spring from the unfortunate fact that 20 years elapsed before the filmmakers brought it to get it to the screen. Force 10 features a firstrate cast with Robert Shaw taking over the Gregory Peck role Edward Fox replacing David Niven as the explosives expert both of whom are joined by Carl Weathers of Rocky fame Barbara Back and Richard Kiel from the James Bond movie The Spy Who Loved Me. The Long Ships lenser Christopher Challis captures all this largerthanlife action with his widescreen photography. Where Eagles Dare  633 Squadron composer Rod Goodwin supplies an exhilarating as well as suspenseful orchestral score.The instant that Robert Shaw and his commandos parachute into the Balkans the British R.A.F. Lancaster bomber that they commandeered after a hardknuckled fist fight with M.P.s blows up. No sooner than they land behind enemy lines than they find themselves prisoners about to be shot as spies by the villainous Nazis. Only at the last possible moment do our valiant heroes triumph over wellnigh impossible odds. They confront the same perilsin a sensethat Hercules faced when he hacked off the Hydra's head only to see two more heads grow back to replace the one that he'd cut off.Aside from a decapitation scene and the sadistic beating that Richard Kiel gives Barbara Bach Force 10 from Navarone is a stylized fantasy in the superb tradition of the World War II propaganda combat movies that Errol Flynn made at Warner Brothers between 1942 and 1945. Although scores of men die bloodletting is kept to a minimum. Take the heroes a stout bunch of lads with clenched jaws and uncompromising virtue. Or the villains a ruthless pack of devils that outnumber the good guys 100 to one. Nevertheless despite the suicidal odds our resourceful heroes carry out their mission but not without considerable trouble. Sadly Alistair MacLean's thrilling novel loses much of its panache in Robin Chapman's script. While Chapman's script keeps most of the plot intact yes they destroy a bridge by blasting a dam to smithereens he has rewritten many scenes eliminated several important characters and added somelike Carl Weather's AfricanAmerican sergeant.Director Guy Hamilton encores explosive footage from director J. Lee Thompson's The Guns of Navarone to remind us that Force 10 qualifies as a sequel. The movie opens with a map to establish the geography of the setting accompanied by stirring narration Deep in the heart of the Aegean Sea lies the island of Navarone. In 1943 it stood poised like a knife in the Allies' side. Hamilton keeps the action crackling and never allows the clutter of the plotMajor Keith Mallory Shaw and Corporal Dusty Miller Fox must identify a traitor as well as help out Lieutenant Colonel Mike Barnsby Harrison Ford of Star Wars and his survivor blow up the bridge. In the book Mallory and Miller were sent in to destroy the bridge and there was no Lt. Colonel Barnsby.To his credit Hamilton has enlisted a persuasive cast convincing special effects and the actual setting of the action scenic Yugoslavia. In his last role Robert Shaw gives a hearty performance as Mallory. Edward Fox is simply delightful as the 'vetty' British explosives expert. When he observes the bridge that Barnsby has been sent to blow up he observes that the force of the charges won't seriously inconvenience the Nazis.Force 10 from Navarone is a seriously underrated World War II feature film.".

A pointless argument ensues which culminates in the driver saying You don't care a damn about me do you?  No says Harrison Ford evenly.  I don't.  The driver bursts out laughing says That's the first straight answer you've given me and gets back to work.If you find the driver's motivations opaque throughout all of this don't expect that the rest of the movie will render them transparent.  Instead expect lots of other scenes every bit as idiotic as this one.  The screenwriters clearly favour the kind of lines that ring out across a stage. What they and many thirdrate playwrights have failed to discover is that such lines never sound other than stupid unless the characters have some reason to utter them.  To be or not to be is a fine thing to say but it needs a context in which it is not nonsense.The pointlessness of it all infects the movie to its very core.  A group of people are tramping out to blow up a bridge that's right they're travelling on FOOT to blow up a BRIDGE but why this matters either way to the war effort is hard to remember even while you're watching.  Few people behave rationally or even comprehensibly.  And the sudden detour upstream to destroy a dam in order to destroy the bridge is one of the most silly aboutfaces I think I've seen capped with weak special effects that only serve to make us ask How can a bridge which is impervious to all explosives be knocked over by a small flood?All the essential trappings of the original are missing.  The inessentials Dmitri Tiomkin's trumpeting fanfare harsh Mediterranean coastline David Niven's performance are missing as well.  But it's the kind of old war movie which you can watch and even enjoy watching while you marvel at its stupidity and wonder why you don't have anything better to do.  I'll give it that.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rarely have I seen a film that can deliver the texture or climate of its subject. Whether by chance or mere coincidence Force 10 was able to transcend the nature of war and the continued intersecting forces that were at play during the WAR. The mood and the feel of this film depicts the greater neurosis and desperation of the English trying acclimatize there place in history. With guerrilla tactics infiltrating allied army posts before the truth of what they did was exposed. You saw as Major Malory's characterRobert Shaw was defiantly gregarious in contrast to Sgt Miller'sEdward Fox whose subordinate intelligent nature led to a believable typecast. While Malory couldn't dismiss his admiration for Leskovar it was tempered by only by his ill will for Leskovar Franco Nero. At this time of the war Germany's infrastructure was still in tact. As it was LT. Barnsby Harrison Ford was interested only on his commands directive despite the odds. Leskovar was able to portray the subtle magnificence that Germany possessed. Although surrounded and outnumbered he stood fast to duty and was unmoved by any peripheral motivations of Malory to stop him. Conversely it was this same menacing quality that was greatly misunderstood and undermined by a bewildered British Parliament.The remarkable leadership Malory portrayed the way this special forces groups and were able to maneuver weaving through the German forces. This was the brilliance Guy Hamiltondirectorcaptured in was in direct juxtaposition of what the Wehrmacht were going through in this film circa 194243 everything seemed quite routine propagandized as if this part of the war was just a larger part of the endgame. This was the climate of the time you could feel the condensing push of allied forces tightening there grip by blowing this bridge would cause a bilge in the German forces creating a forced hemorrhage within Army group.The unsettling dampness of Unasylva Forest woven through slumbering Corsican pines that elbowed there way over an uneven earth plump with unforgiving terrains that would of allied the Axis at this time. This late Autumn feeling emanated throughout the film the precipice of change was completely missed on the critics. So as the Wehrmacht regrouped amongst the Bridge head and silver firs that spiked curving bridgehead the terrain helped to sustain the Wehrmachts march. It felt as if you were in the EAST in 194243 when hope for Germany was still a plausible horizon. So it was the death of Leskovar that represented the turning point as the rise of the American Hero significantly allowed for Britain's role to be inwardly reserved albeit an antinomical position. And the advent of any resistance was carried out with an seemingly all do or die attitude. This translates through the film and resonates better than any other war film I have seen on this topic. Because it dealt with precisely the indifference of war while other battles were being fought. The a cataclysmic battle of wills and what one side was willing to do on every level and even this highlighted in the railway car where Leskovar had attempted to stop the saboteurs and forbade the plans of Barnsby and Malory. This was a polarizing moment when all could of been won or lost. Why had Leskovar gotten back on the train car he had to of known by then he would be found out. He might of ordered another division to shoot the traincar and warned the bridge ahead. These are the speculative questions of war the in this film I feel are overlooked by some this film is magnificently real and I feel people wanted a more Hollywood feel.Then at last the fuses to be lit Miller Barnaby and Malory are anxious to boggle the whole deal and get caught but again the weight of German Tanks are again their undoing the symbolism in this film are uncanny. Even if they weren't the real Tigers or Panzer corps.The Tigers albeit monster were unsuited for most every terrain and battlefield in which they fought. This magnifies advanced thought process but also the egotism that over thought and fought useless battles one after the next. And the greatest battle was with the weather while this film brings this into the perfect backdrop. All the while the useless battles of division and armored divisions raged on that would of been better suited and served in the greater offensive or defense that Germany was later faced with. And the long stem irony of this film that one bridge destroyed could of ended the war.But this underscores the greater example of symbolism in this film. Perhaps an ethereal bridge of atonement might of better explained that in the end it was the bridge of communication that was that would need to be crossed time and time again. This is why the balance of leadership must be one voice restrained by reason and when these lines are broken or intercepted it is hard to sustain any chain of command. And so the Force 10 from Navarone's The guns of Navarone are left for the Victorious ones and their books of fiction. Humanity and the historical texts that in reality written as revisionist history books well we can see what we have done with that history of humanity.".

Even if they weren't the real Tigers or Panzer corps.The Tigers albeit monster were unsuited for most every terrain and battlefield in which they fought. This magnifies advanced thought process but also the egotism that over thought and fought useless battles one after the next. And the greatest battle was with the weather while this film brings this into the perfect backdrop. All the while the useless battles of division and armored divisions raged on that would of been better suited and served in the greater offensive or defense that Germany was later faced with. And the long stem irony of this film that one bridge destroyed could of ended the war.But this underscores the greater example of symbolism in this film. Perhaps an ethereal bridge of atonement might of better explained that in the end it was the bridge of communication that was that would need to be crossed time and time again. This is why the balance of leadership must be one voice restrained by reason and when these lines are broken or intercepted it is hard to sustain any chain of command. And so the Force 10 from Navarone's The guns of Navarone are left for the Victorious ones and their books of fiction. Humanity and the historical texts that in reality written as revisionist history books well we can see what we have done with that history of humanity.";

From the blue Aegean Sea to the nasty back alley Balkan partisan war in Yugoslavia the characters played by Gregory Peck and David Niven now played by Robert Shaw and Edward Fox are sent back into the fight on another undercover mission. Or on a pair of them.This time they're joined by Americans Harrison Ford and Carl Weathers on the team. And the boys have two missions to accomplish. Ford and Weathers have to get a bridge blown up so the Germans can't move heavy concentrations of troops. Colonel Alan Badel of the partisans has some limited forces at his disposal to stop them if they don't. But there's also an agent in the partisan camp and that's Shaw's job to kill the traitor.If you remember The Guns Of Navarone best try and put it out of your mind because this film isn't nearly as good. If you remember that film Gregory Peck's character was that of a mountain climber and his part in that mission was to get that team up the steep face of a cliff where the Germans wouldn't be looking. He was not a trained assassin as Shaw is. But I'm guessing the screenplay authors forgot that little detail when they wrote this film.The Sixties and Seventies were the decade when black players began to get all kinds of roles and stopped being in the stereotyped parts that they had been relegated to before. In fact though in some cases they were shoehorned into situations that just wouldn't have applied. Such is the case for Carl Weathers who there is no way a black man would have been on this kind of mission back in the day. The Armed Forces weren't even integrated until after World War II. But the script went through all kind of hoops to make sure Weathers was kept well hidden while the rest of the team blended with the surroundings.But beyond that Force 10 From Navarone resembles one of those propagandistic films from the World War II era where the Nazis were often played as incredibly stupid. It most resembles that Errol Flynn action film Desperate Journey one of the dumber A films to come out from that era. Harrison Ford was fresh from his breakthrough starring role as Han Solo in Star Wars and I guess this was kind of training for his later Indiana Jones films. But Force 10 From Navarone doesn't have the color and lan of any Indiana Jones pulp film. The force was not with this movie.".

I guess I just have to learn to accept it and move on. But it makes me wonder why a movie such as this with big stars from the day like Ford Shaw and even Weathers gets made with so little commitment to authenticity. I think you could probably allow some creative license for westerns where the characters have long hair but come on World War II?!! The whole deal about armed forces discipline and the fashions of the time dictate that a 'fro is just out of place. Period. Reminds me of Donald Sutherland's hippie tank driver from Kelly's Heroes.

Some of the aged inhabitants recall their childhood experiences and these experiences are shown as separate short films. Lurdes tries to corelate all their stories in order to do which she slowly becomes a part of Obaba. The village is perhaps meant to be treated as a consciousness as suggested by the director by his brilliant use of the myth of green lizards as a metaphor.The film excludes all the typical and clichd camera angles and shot sequences. For using visual themes it does many brave experiments. Some of the acting performances are worth mentioning too for example the actress who played the schoolteacher or the boy who played Esteban.

She is soon drawn to some of the stories of the residents all of which are told in flashbacks. These stories help Lourdes to understand the town its people and its secrets.Montxo Armendriz who wrote the screenplay and also directed has put together a fine film that blends the past and the present. Rather than use Lourdes simply as a device for prompting the villagers to tell their stories she is an integral part of the movie. Lourdes is intrigued by the tales and the town's superstitions and she soon begins to wonder if she has been caught up in and affected by it all. However the film takes only a few of the stories from Axtaga's collection and any political overtones don't seem to be present. The movie takes a more realistic tone and lacks any fantastical elements other than the mysterious bluegreen lizards that seem to be indigenous to the area.".

Viewers can't help but fall deeply in love with Lourdes played by Barbara Lennie. She is impossibly perfect for the role and in it both because of her incredible natural beauty and because of her flawless ability to make us believe that she isn't acting. But something is missing in the film. As the other reviewer commented there are a few stories going forward in parallel but you feel there may have been more that weren't included. So it feels somehow incomplete. The other reviewer knew about the missing parts from the book and the missing political overtones. I didn't but subconsciously I was hungering for them near the end of the film. This is one of those films where you feel they may have had or could have had a perfect 3 hour movie but had to edit it down to two hours and perhaps cut out some of the most interesting parts. Lourdes carries the burden of three romances the romance between her and her lover in the film the one developing between her and the audience and finally the one with Obaba. The nude scenes of the actress early in the film may have been as important in breaking the tension between her and the audience as they were breaking that between her and her lover. It's my personal biased opinion interpretation that the director of the film was only able to make us fall that deeply in love with her because we were looking through his eyes his and those of Obaba the town's itself! So what's the point? Are we from this point on able to be as seduced by Obaba as she was? With her seduction of her lover and us complete... the story can shift its emphasis onto the love affair between her and Obaba the town which covets her as much as we did. But how can a town seduce a beautiful successful film student? In any case this film is charming and a very fascinating portrayal of the heart of Obaba a character with a complex personality that in the end is the principal character in the film.".

The film idea was going nowhere... I was sure it would have a foggy end and of course... it did! Nothing exceptional... Not even the landscapes I hopped that being placed in a mountain village at least the landscapes would be nice.. but no. Just a lame story about a crazy teacher and of course her crazy students... now all grown up each of them.. with hisher own fixed ideas. And boy some of those ideas were stupid.. like the lizard story for example. At a moment I thought I was watching x files.. with the lizard entering in the ear and all. No.. from my point of view this movie is a waste of time not to say money if U pay for the ticket The only part that I did like was the acting of the young blue eye german kid... He played very well and convincing for his age... The rest... nothing! I read the previous review and I think the script writer and the director were both on drugs when they came up with those ideas. Well considering that there are a lot of people that enjoyed this film... I think to myself again.. Maybe I am the crazy one. Advice.. Don't waste your time with this!".

She plays an aspiring and highly idealistic actress from Franklin Vermont who will suffer anything in all innocence to reach her goal of celebrity in the New York theatre. Hepburn instantly grabs the viewer's attention and sympathy as she gabbles earnestly about the letter from Bernard Shaw she keeps under her pillow or her resolve to commit suicide on stage at the height of her fame. The viewer understands that she is one of Nature's fragile flowers and needs protection from life's cruelties. At the end of the film in what should be her moment of triumph we are left uneasily troubled over what will happen to her next.Able support is given by a trio of fine male costars. Douglas Fairbanks Jr is the successful playwright who slowly comes to develop deep feelings for Hepburn. Adolphe Menjou plays the powerful and slightly caddish theatrical manager who takes advantage of Kate at a very vulnerable moment. Best of all marvelous old Sir C. Aubrey Smith plays Kate's first New York friend a gentlemanly English actor reduced to performing small roles who is bemused by Hepburn's zeal.Mary Duncan scores as a selfish manipulative stage star. Tyler Brooke as an alcoholic author and Richard Carle as an important newspaper critic have a couple of good scenes especially when they get Kate drunk at Menjou's fancy party thereby loosening her inhibitions and giving her the courage to very ably enact some lines by Hamlet  Juliet.Early on when Ms. Duncan compares Menjou  Fairbanks to 'Wheeler  Woolsey' she was referring to RKO's comedy team of Bert Wheeler and Robert Woolsey. Although from 1929 to 1937 they starred in a series of 22 often hilarious movies they are now sadly almost forgotten.".

Adolphe Menjou plays the powerful and slightly caddish theatrical manager who takes advantage of Kate at a very vulnerable moment. Best of all marvelous old Sir C. Aubrey Smith plays Kate's first New York friend a gentlemanly English actor reduced to performing small roles who is bemused by Hepburn's zeal.Mary Duncan scores as a selfish manipulative stage star. Tyler Brooke as an alcoholic author and Richard Carle as an important newspaper critic have a couple of good scenes especially when they get Kate drunk at Menjou's fancy party thereby loosening her inhibitions and giving her the courage to very ably enact some lines by Hamlet  Juliet.Early on when Ms. Duncan compares Menjou  Fairbanks to 'Wheeler  Woolsey' she was referring to RKO's comedy team of Bert Wheeler and Robert Woolsey. Although from 1929 to 1937 they starred in a series of 22 often hilarious movies they are now sadly almost forgotten.";

	schema:reviewBody "MORNING GLORY RKO Radio 1933 directed by Lowell Sherman stars Katharine Hepburn in her third feature film and one she was born to play. The story involves Eva Lovelace Hepburn an aspiring actress from Vermont who comes to New York City in hope to get an acting job in the theater. While at an employment office she comes across a veteran actor C. Aubrey Smith a theatrical manager Adolphe Menjou and a young playwright Douglas Fairbanks Jr. who at first thinks she's daffy. Eventually the leading lady Mary Duncan of the upcoming play walks out on opening night because the producer refuses to meet her salary demands. Then Eva the understudy is given her big opportunity to take her place. After her stage performance which is not presented on screen Eva steals the show and becomes an overnight success. Now in love with the playwright Fairbanks Eva comes to realize then and there that a career and a relationship cannot mix which places her in a dilemma.While Hepburn won her first Academy Award for her performance here I personally feel her role as Jo March in LITTLE WOMEN RKO 1933 was far better suited for her and should have gotten the award for that one instead. And like the character of Eva Lovelace no one can be Jo March but Kate Hepburn. The story elements to MORNING GLORY does echo Kate's early stage origins. In spite of some scenes where she at times overacts this is HER movie from start to finish. In a TV documentary on Kate's movie career it was said that Constance Bennett was scheduled star as Eva Lovelace but when Kate read the script she saw herself as that character and got to play her instead. Kate is however convincing when she changes from naive youth to a mature woman. The movie includes some very witty dialog to help the story along. Great bit The exchange between Mary Duncan and Geneva Mitchell outside Menjou's office You've gained. Response I'll soon be your size my dear! Another memorable scene is Kate's reenacting the Romeo and Juliet balcony scene at a dinner party. Kate and Adolphe Menjou later appeared in STAGE DOOR RKO 1937 with Ginger Rogers which improved over MORNING GLORY. Both have the elements of looking like a filmed stage play but the 1937 production presented more characters and a plot that moved at a faster pace.MORNING GLORY which was distributed on video cassette in the 1980s first by Nostalgia Merchant and later through RKO Radio Home Video played regularly on the American Movie Classics cable channel prior to 2000. MORNING GLORY was remade in 1958 as STAGE STRUCK with Susan Strasberg and Henry Fonda but while both versions can be seen from time to time on Turner Classic Movies it appears that MORNING GLORY happens to be the better known of the two. 12".

	schema:reviewBody "How Katharine Hepburn won an Oscar for Best Actress of this film is a bit mystery. I mean she's okay but nothing special. This was only her third film. Many think it would have been more appropriate had she won for Little Women her second film also done in 1933. Frankly I liked her better in Alice Adams her one of three movies she did in 1935.Whatever. Her character in the movie is better than the story which totally runs out of steam in the second half so much so that I frankly didn't care at that point what happened to country girl Eva Lovelace in her quest to be a big actress in New York City. Those who like stage plays will like this movie because that is what it is based on Zoe Atkins play. Some may find it dated but that's not unusual considering the date. I find many early 1930s films very dated but still a lot of fun. Hepburn plays a charming girl in this and had a beautiful face when she was young so I can tolerate her snobby accent. In this story she was a delight compared to Mary Duncan's role as the spoiled actress coddled by Adolph Menjou. And speaking of actors Hepburn may get all the attention but Douglas Fairbanks Jr. is every bit as good as her if not better in this film. Why didn't he win an Oscar?One complaint it's hard to understand a sizable amount of dialog in here. Words are slurred or breathlessly delivered I really hate that and you find yourself saying what did she say? It's ridiculous. I saw this on VHS. However the good news is that it is now available on disc as part of the Katharine Hepburn Collection and has the subtitle option if one is interesting in seeing it. There is a catch you have to pay 50 since it is part of a set.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sometimes I get irritated at how narcissistic Hollywood is even on the subject matter of its films  there's an obvious Hollywood bias in favor of stories about show business especially show business people.  It seems as if even if the main story isn't about show business there's  inevitably a girlfriend who's a nightclub singer or someone's putting on a skit or having a talent show.  However there are some exceptions to this tiresome selfpromotion.  The Gaynor and Garland versions of A Star is Born What Price Hollywood Stage Door and Sunset Boulevard come to mind.  Here's another film about becoming a star that I love.  Morning Glory is about a stagestruck young girl who makes it to the top.  Sound familiar?  Yes but there's a charming little variant here  she achieves her stardom with her naivet intact.  This proposition would seem hard to swallow if it weren't for the fact that the young ingenue happens to be a very young Katherine Hepburn.  You don't need gauze over the lens with Hepburn before the camera. She seems to generate her own nimbus.  It also helps that Adolphe Menjou is present as the worldly wise cynical yet in the end kind impresario.But for me the biggest treat is that Hepburn was directed in Morning Glory to her first Oscar by the great Lowell Sherman whose untimely death deprived movie lovers of a great talent both behind and in front of the camera.  What is so eerie about Sherman is his almost autobiographical endlife in film.  In Morning Glory he was directing a brand new star playing a brand new star.  And in What Price Hollywood the prototype of A Star is Born Sherman actually played a director who discovers and develops a new star a director who's at the end of his rope  as Sherman actually was!  What Price Hollywood was Sherman's penultimate film  he died worn out two years later. Sure Morning Glory is dated to modern audiences but even if you're unable to get over yourself and make allowances for pass cinematic styles which are inevitable in films not far removed from the pantomime of silents let yourself get a kick out of watching this story behind the story.".

And a subdued Fairbanks is just a fairly attractive face and not much else to him.Adolph Menjou is sexy worldlywise and offhandedly kind in this film. Unlike other reviewers here on IMDb.com I can see why Hepburn's character falls for him. I would have too. When you're feeling vulnerable an attractive daddy figure can sweep you off your feet.C.

	schema:reviewBody "The plot is simple obsessively starstruck Eva Lovelace comes to Hollywood and tries to get a role onstage. She's 'a bit of a character' amusing producer Lewis Easton and charming writer Joseph Sheridan right away. One of the best scenes in the film is when she introduces herself to the two of them her incessant stream of chatter is a wonder to behold some of the things she says funny and chilling at the same time. Eva for example has envisioned her own death by her own hand while onstage at the 'xenith' of her career. She is childish in her earnestness and so romantic and imaginative that she is deeply stricken by the disappointments that pile one on top of another be it tanking in a role or being unceremoniously 'dumped' by Easton after a onenight stand. The ending of the film is both chilling and puzzling is Eva a character to be sympathised with then?In other words the film itself is certainly nothing special. It would be forgotten except for the fact that Katharine Hepburn screen legend won her first Academy Award for it. Was it deserved? Much as I love Hepburn I hesitate to say it isthere are roles she has played that are indubitably worthier than that of Eva Lovelace. Tracy Lord in The Philadelphia Story comes immediately to mind. Of course the Academy never does seem to reward real merit perhaps this award was as much for Little Women released in the same year as it was for Morning Glory.This is not to say of course that Hepburn was bad. Far from it. She does a delightful job of portraying the obsessively earnest Eva and she's a delight in her inebriated scenes. While drunk her Eva displays undoubted signs of both the comic genius and the dramatic ability we've come to associate with Hepburn. Her reading of Shakespeare is both dark and evil and light and lovely. Even the last ambivalent scene is a triumph for her.Even so if you want to see Hepburn giving a masterful portrayal of a stagestruck actress however may I recommend the infinitely more entertaining and qualitatively superior film STAGE DOOR. She is unreservedly excellent in that.For all we know of Eva Lovelace she might well have been a morning gloryan overnight star whose fame and fortune disappears almost as quickly as it began. We know far more about the actress who played Eva of course and we know for certain that Katharine Hepburn is no morning glory. Her career has lasted six decades her impact on American film and the role of women therein is immeasurable... and oddly enough Morning Glory is how it all started. Perhaps given Hepburn's unique and unconventional life and career that is in the end most fitting.".

Usually I love old black  white movies and have no problem if they are a bit dated but this was laughable annoying and simply bad. Don't know should we blame the script director or Katherine Hepburn  we see her first waiting with other hopefuls in front of producer's office talking and introducing herself to strangers so far so goodshe is obviously not sophisticated and very naive but during the next five minutes we realize something is wrong with this girl she talks to much she is too eager in fact she never listens anyone and talks constantly about herself without pausing for a breath. Again maybe this were director's instructions  Hepburn is so annoying that today we would classify her as deludedderanged and definitely off balance.

Now this is all very confusing  I have seen lots of old classics from 1920s1930s and 1940s and from what I have seen these old movies reflect atmosphere and public morals of the timeshowever this is simply bad case of overacting. All the other characters including obvious comical cameos have certain human normal touch to them but Hepburn is simply mad. I mean I would press help button under my table and call for the ambulance to sedate her and get her away. That Hepburn actually won Oscar for this movie is absolutely mystifying  just look at the acting of Mary AstorJoan Crawford Jean Harlow not to mention Bette DavisGarbo or any other actress of the 1930s and underneath obvious Hollywood cellophane we can see natural acting or at least attempts to appear human.

	schema:reviewBody "When Katharine Hepburn first appeared on cinema screens she was deemed a great new star even winning an Oscar  for the film under review  almost instantly however before long audiences had grown tired of her particular brand of histrionics and the actress was quickly declared boxoffice poison! She then wisely changed pace to screwball comedy with Howard Hawks' BRINGING UP BABY 1938 was subsequently handed a onceinalifetime part on a silver platter by playwright and personal friend Philip Barry no less! with The Philadelphia Story superbly filmed by George Cukor in 1940 eventually became an institution when she teamed up for 9 films and in real life with Spencer Tracy and ultimately grew into the First Lady of Acting  going on to win 3 more golden statuettes a record several years after her first! But for what it is worth it all started here...Truth be told I have never been much of a fan of Hepburn's  though I concede that she has appeared in many a fine film throughout her lengthy career. Anyway the role she plays here fits her like a glove i.e. that of an ambitious young actress rising to the top out of pure chance and sacrificing stardom for love indeed the title is a trade phrase for such meteoric members of the profession.

	onyx:emotionText "When Katharine Hepburn first appeared on cinema screens she was deemed a great new star even winning an Oscar  for the film under review  almost instantly however before long audiences had grown tired of her particular brand of histrionics and the actress was quickly declared boxoffice poison! She then wisely changed pace to screwball comedy with Howard Hawks' BRINGING UP BABY 1938 was subsequently handed a onceinalifetime part on a silver platter by playwright and personal friend Philip Barry no less! with The Philadelphia Story superbly filmed by George Cukor in 1940 eventually became an institution when she teamed up for 9 films and in real life with Spencer Tracy and ultimately grew into the First Lady of Acting  going on to win 3 more golden statuettes a record several years after her first! But for what it is worth it all started here...Truth be told I have never been much of a fan of Hepburn's  though I concede that she has appeared in many a fine film throughout her lengthy career. Anyway the role she plays here fits her like a glove i.e. that of an ambitious young actress rising to the top out of pure chance and sacrificing stardom for love indeed the title is a trade phrase for such meteoric members of the profession. Actually the narrative is not quite as maudlin as it appears from this plot line  and yet the brief 74minute runningtime does not give it much of a chance either we are told that Hepburn seeks acting lessons from aged luminary C.

However when seen today Morning Glory seems incredibly antiquatedand much of it is due to Miss Hepburn's rather bizarre performance. At times she is likable and engaging while at others I just cringed at her overacting. And yet oddly she received her first Oscar for this uneven performance. It's an obvious example of how times and tastes have changedsuch a performance would never be allowed today. It also might help to put these early Oscars in some perspective. They were NOT chosen like they are today but at that time picked by a small group of studio owners and their pawns. So if the bigwigs decided to award an Oscar they did. Surely some actress did a better job in a movie in 1933! Perhaps it was just a slow year but could it have been THAT slow?! Hepburn plays a young lady who has come to Broadway to make a name for herself. However she is not at all polished and VERY full of herself so it's not surprising that the going is rough for her career. The only thing that saves her is a strange waiflike quality that makes some men want to look out for her and help her....though she isn't a particularly distinguished actress on stage. However later in the film the nasty diva refuses to go on and the writer of the play convinces the producer to give his protg a chance. Naturally and magically it is Kate and naturally she's inexplicably a huge success...and the film soon ends after Hepburn GROAN muses about the fleeting nature of success.The plot isn't bad though the way Hepburn goes from nobody to leading lady is a bit clichdeven for 1933. 42nd Street and many other musicals have done the exact same bit so seeing it once again was a bit disappointing. The main problem with the film was clearly Hepburn. I am not sure if the blame can be entirely placed on herperhaps the director wanted this campy and uneven performance. The writing too cannot be ignoredsome of Hepburn's lines were pretty tough to believe. All in all I see this as a mildly interesting but way way overrated film. Much as I said might be due to changing tastesall I know is that I would put this in my Top 10 list for least Oscarworthy Oscar winners.".

	schema:headline " A true artist only has one marriage to their career.";
	schema:reviewBody "Katharine Hepburn a little woman with a long career certainly believed in one marriage and for her life on stage and screen there was no bill of divorcement. Here she's a newbee from Vermont anxious to make her New York debut. Showing up at producer Adolph Menjou's office she is very determined. Sort of like Miss Hepburn herself she doesn't seem to take no for an answer and for those who only know the shaky voice and head of the older Kate this is a great way to see the real her. It's not her first film or first lead that came with her first film and it's easy to see why even as a young lady she was an imitator's delight.As this was during the depression it was a difficult time for established stars let alone undiscovered promising actresses so it won't be easy. Mentions of still open Broadway theaters gives this an exciting yet historical tone to theater aficionados and for those discovering their passion for the stage this is a great way to get a sense of what went on behind the scenes during the golden age of the American theata. RKO gets a plug in by dropping contract player names Wheeler and Woolsey as well as mentioning the legendary Katharine Cornell. C. Aubrey Smith stands out in a major supporting part as Hepburn's self proclaimed mentor. Hepburn is fascinating to watch so affected eccentric egotistical but desperate and absolutely delightful. Less memorable is Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as a rather dull playwright more a publicity stunt cast due to headlines concerning wife Joan Crawford and made the same year he costarred with the not yet famous Bette Davis. I would have preferred she have more scenes with Menjou whom she would play a similar part opposite in the even better Stage Door.There's some delightfully bitchy dialog between Mary Duncan and Geneva Mitchell playing friendly one moment and finding the tender spot in the other's back to insert the knife. Hepburn gets several lines that have become legendary and ironically she returned to Broadway this year in a flop where she muttered a certain line about calalillies.

	onyx:emotionText "Katharine Hepburn a little woman with a long career certainly believed in one marriage and for her life on stage and screen there was no bill of divorcement. Here she's a newbee from Vermont anxious to make her New York debut. Showing up at producer Adolph Menjou's office she is very determined. Sort of like Miss Hepburn herself she doesn't seem to take no for an answer and for those who only know the shaky voice and head of the older Kate this is a great way to see the real her. It's not her first film or first lead that came with her first film and it's easy to see why even as a young lady she was an imitator's delight.As this was during the depression it was a difficult time for established stars let alone undiscovered promising actresses so it won't be easy. Mentions of still open Broadway theaters gives this an exciting yet historical tone to theater aficionados and for those discovering their passion for the stage this is a great way to get a sense of what went on behind the scenes during the golden age of the American theata. RKO gets a plug in by dropping contract player names Wheeler and Woolsey as well as mentioning the legendary Katharine Cornell. C. Aubrey Smith stands out in a major supporting part as Hepburn's self proclaimed mentor. Hepburn is fascinating to watch so affected eccentric egotistical but desperate and absolutely delightful. Less memorable is Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as a rather dull playwright more a publicity stunt cast due to headlines concerning wife Joan Crawford and made the same year he costarred with the not yet famous Bette Davis. I would have preferred she have more scenes with Menjou whom she would play a similar part opposite in the even better Stage Door.There's some delightfully bitchy dialog between Mary Duncan and Geneva Mitchell playing friendly one moment and finding the tender spot in the other's back to insert the knife. Hepburn gets several lines that have become legendary and ironically she returned to Broadway this year in a flop where she muttered a certain line about calalillies. This doesn't just focus on Kate but drops the camera on several typical theater archetypes often smashed and overly dramatic. For Kate this is really a top drawer example as to why she started off so well even if she needed to tone down certain mannerisms to become different in each part she played.";

As luck has it a comet nears the earth and causes a time rift sending the two groups of soldiers back to 1572. The two sides are now in confusion as to where their nuke has gone to and how to return home.While in years past they're robbed by what appears to be a common thief but then they all realize the person is General Lee a famous general who kept Korea from being invaded by japan. The war film now becomes a comedy trying to find different ways for Lee to prepare for battle and how modern weapons can somehow be carried over to ancient times. Meanwhile the brilliant scientist might have found a way to travel home given the comet's time cycle is 433 years but what about the Nuke and who win wind up victorious in the oncoming battle against the barbarians that threaten the lives of them and General Lee? Its very gripping and leaves you wondering what the outcome will be.The movie would have to be considered war comedy mostly as the clash of different things in time is what most of the humor focuses on but its not just that. Some moments like the big battles are very intense with bloody sword fights. The story is great and while its got some serious moments its easy to follow and anyone can enjoy it. Go to see this if you're looking for something different and new. Its an original and clever idea thats pulled off nicely.".

The story centers on a group of North and South Korean soldiers who find themselves flung back in time just as their respective countries are locked in a tense standoff with the United States over the status of a jointly produced nuclear warhead. The film kicks off with stock footage of the historic meeting between the two Korean leaders in June 2000 using this real life moment as a springboard for the film's fictional premise that North and South Korea secretly formed an alliance agreeing to coproduce their very own weapon of mass destruction! But when the two Koreas decide to hand over the warhead to the United States North Korean military officer Kang Min Gil Kim Seung Woo decides to take matters into his own hands and not only steal the weapon with the help of a band of private soldiers but kidnap the female South Korean scientist Kong Hyo Jin who helped create it as well! Things get even more difficult for Kang as South Korean Navy Officer Park Jeong Woo Hwang Jung Min is sent by his superiors to capture the rogue soldier and reclaim the weapon.

	schema:headline " Get Lost";
	schema:reviewBody "Back in 1995 Barry Sonnenfeld directed a movie that ended up on many  critics best of lists by the time the year's recaps were being printed  in entertainment publications. The movie was Get Shorty and it gave  lead star John Travolta his second big hit in as many years after Pulp  Fiction put him back in front of the paparazzi's lenses. Based on a  novel by Elmore Leonard the film focused on wise guy Chili Palmer  Travolta and his attempts to break into the movie business.  I for one was completely captured by the diverse characters and crisp  dialogue of the original. So much so that when I heard there was going  to be a sequel I seemed to forgo my usual shivering that occurs when a  studio tries to rehash what was a good idea over ten years later.  The sequel also based on a novel by Leonard is this time directed by  F. Gary Gray who's Italian Job in 2003 was one of the years highest  grossing films. Couple that with the cast now expanding to include Uma  Thurman Harvey Keitel Cedric the Entertainer The Rock Vince Vaughn  and James Woods and you have all the makings of a great continuance in  the exploits of one of the more interesting characters of the 1990's.  This time round we pick up as Chili Travolta is leaving the movie  business after being disappointed in both himself and the industry for  participating in the making of a sequel to his successful first film.  Thanks in small part to his friend Tommy Athens Woods and the  misfortune of his death Chili decides to look into the lucrative and  dangerous music industry.  This first leads to the famous Viper club where Chili meets singing  sensation Linda Moon Christina Milian who as lead of an upstart trio  can belt out tunes like Whitney Houston that is the Whitney before  Bobby Brown started bringing home the small packages of sugar.  Linda is under contract with Raji Vaughn who with his overly  apparent gay bodyguard Elliot Wilhelm The Rock plan to ensure Linda  fulfills the final five years of her contract even if that means  putting Chili on ice.  So with Linda's future in the balance Chili weaves an interesting web  which will include a record producer Thurman a gangsta sound mixer  Cedric the Russian mob the police Aerosmith's lead singer Steven  Tyler and a whole lot of angry gun pointing. WooWheee! That sounds  exciting. So why wasn't it? Be Cool tries too hard to well be cool.  But the result is a film that unlike the original has no heart and no  soul. Be Cool feels instead like it was directed by a Saturday Night  Live producer as there are individual scenes or skits that don't string  together over a whole movie. Take for example the scene where Travolta  and Thurman dance together for the first time since Pulp Fiction as  Black Eyed Peas performs live in the background. The scene is forced  and should have ended up on the cutting room floor. Instead it is  coupled between two other needless chapters that do nothing to push the  story forwards with any real thrust. The Aerosmith concert and The  Rock's trip to a boot shop are also prime examples of individual  moments that don't amount to much of a movie when put together.  But those aren't the only issues with the sequel  which could probably  be renamed Product Placement with the amount of 2Ways and Diet Pepsi's  that seem to stare at you more intensely than Chili's serious look. The  story contains just about every stereotype imaginable and each one has  just enough screen time to become slightly offensive or embarrassing.  Whether it is the gangsta entourage or the gay muscle guy that has a  movie poster of Sylvester Stallone's Rhinestone on the wall no  characters is above offering us anything we haven't seen many times  before and in much better films.  With the magic all but gone from the first film we end up with an  inferior product that is the second film in the past six months  Ocean's 13 being the other that cram a bunch of stars onto a marquee  only to end up as a movie that no actor would bring to an open  audition.  Be Cool was a major disappointment. I so wanted it to be the Get Shorty  of the new millennium and I ended up with a film where the outtakes  must have been a gas but experience left me with a stinker.".

He plays it like he's a bored movie exec rather than a bored movie exec who used to be a Shylock. Uma Thurman great in nearly every role she's ever played comes off as strained and confusing. Is she supposed to be ditzy or clever? The chemistry between her and Travolta is strained and uncomfortable. Other than that just add every movie clich you can think of. A welleducated rap producer by Cedric the Entertainer an inept gangster wannabe in Andre 3000 the girl with heart soul and a good set of pipes in Christina Milian a gimmicky black dude wannabe in Vince Vaughn and a stupid celebrity cameo by Stephen Tyler. The only funny part was the Rock who invents his own new clich as a gay Samoan bodyguard actor wannabe. Probably the biggest crime is the plot IT MAKES NO SENSE. Get Shorty was clever with Chili playing one group against another and coming out on top. But this film tries that with about a million different characters. And even Chili doesn't seem to know what's going on. Fans of Get Shorty be warned this is a very different very worse movie.".

This movie is bad. I wanted to enjoy it and I just couldn't. With all of this talent you'd think this would've been at least watchable right? Wrong.Let's play Sucked and Didn't Suck! John Travolta Very likable. Though obviously buried under too much makeup I found him to be enjoyable to watch. Didn't suck.Uma Thurman After Kill Bill 1 and 2 the girl deserves more than this atrociously written character. This character's big moment was showing someone how to operate a TMobile Sidekick. Sucked.Vince Vaughn The done to death role of white guy who thinks he's black goes to Vince Money Vaughn. Is this character template still considered to be funny? I love the guy but I want to see him in something better than this. It felt like he was slumming. Sucked.Cedric the Entertainer This guy is good. He delivers a great monologue after being called a racial slur you can probably guess as to what it is that was probably the best part of the movie. He was funny and truly elevated the material he was given just with his presence. Didn't suck.Harvey Keitel Sucked due to a phoned in performance.James Woods Sucked but not his fault. Actually yes it was. Reminded me of his role in Casino for some reason. I don't like manic James Woods I like slow burn James Woods. Victim of bad writing maybe? Andre 3000 Sucked but he went down swinging. I think he has potential as long as he's not being directed by a hack on his next picture.Christina Milian She's absolutely beautiful and obviously talented but this movie isn't going to make her a star. Didn't suck but needs a better vehicle for her talents that isn't directed by a hack.The Rock This should have been the role that catapulted him to movie stardom but as directed by F. Gary Gray winds up sadly mishandled. In this movie the Rock projects this charisma that makes him so likable that I wound up feeling sorry for him. He tries really hard and while he doesn't succeed completely he gets an A for effort from me. This guy is not afraid to embarrass himself and go completely against type playing a gay bodyguard with his eyes on stardom. I really want to see him make it big. He has what it takes as long as he's not being directed by a hack.Which brings me to what I feel was the weak link in this production. I might as well just come out and say it right? F. Gary Gray's direction was about as solid as really bad diarrhea. Wow it was bad. Who had the bright idea of letting this guy direct? The Negotiator was good but what else on his resume convinced people that he was the man for the job? Between his direction and the atrocious writing I'm willing to chip in for both culprits to get a nice lead salad to the knees. Wanna see John and Uma dance? I might be able to think of another movie with those two that I could recommend watching instead of this. Not worth the ten dollars and fifty cents it cost me to get into the theater.This movie could've been okay and it wasn't even just okay.RATING  out of .P.S. Fergie from Black Eyed Peas is noteworthy to mention. Sizzling!".

	schema:reviewBody "This is no Get Shorty but it's full of so much selfdeprecating humor that you can't help but cut it a break. I laughed quite a few times and there's a lot of fun moments. However the film is a bit uneven. It's a comedy but then how funny is the Russian Mafia? The movie tries hard to find the humor in hit men and quirky characters but it often seems to be trying a bit too hard. The movie is so crammed with celebrities that it's distracting and the parade of glitterati takes you outside the film more than once. It's less brutal than Get Shorty and the language is much milder but it also lacks the freshness and irreverence that made Get Shorty so much fun. As sequels go it's a pretty good movie and John Travolta and others in the film are so obviously having a good time it's impossible not to get into the groove. There are many charming performances including The Rock and Andre 3000 both showing a real knack for comedy. Definitely worth a visit to the multiplex as long as you keep your expectations in check.".

However the film is a bit uneven. It's a comedy but then how funny is the Russian Mafia? The movie tries hard to find the humor in hit men and quirky characters but it often seems to be trying a bit too hard.

Christina Milian was not really used to her potential as an actress but displayed her ability to sing very well. The other performances from the actors in the movie you would probably expect without any surprise.

Using his negotiation skills he tries to run an independent record label with the wife of a murdered friend played by Uma Thurman and try to get his young singer Christina Milian a hit record.Before I saw this sequel I had heard that it was a terrible film. However Be Cool is still an enjoyable comedy even if it's not as good as the original. The movie focuses on the music industry this time around instead of the movie industry. The music business is portrayed very poorly in the movie and they use a bunch of lame stereotypes. I can't tell if this was the intention or not since Get Shorty did a nice job of spoofing the movie industry. The same can't be said for the sequel and the attempts just come as lazy.An impressive cast is what saves the movie from sinking. The best performance is given by The Rock and it's nice to see him in a different type of role. Vince Vaughn also gives a funny performance though he started to get annoying before the end. Surprisingly Uma Thurman gives an average performance and I was expecting more from her. John Travolta returns as Chili and he does an okay job. His performance is kind of dull though. Christina Milian gives a horrible performance and she's also not that good of a singer. Cedric the Entertainer gives a good performance though he isn't in the film for very long. There are also a bunch of cameos including Steven Tyler and James Wood.F. Gary Gray directs and he does a poor job. He just doesn't handle the film very well and the movie is kind of a mess. There was also a ton of product placement and it got annoying after awhile. Also at 118 minutes the film is too long and there are a lot of slow spots. The film needed to be edited badly and it clearly wasn't. Fortunately for the film the actors are able to rise above the weak direction and script and they deliver some funny scenes. Sometimes the film tried too hard while other times it was actually pretty funny. Compared to the original the sequel doesn't measure up well. However Be Cool is a fairly harmless and forgettable comedy. In the end Be Cool is worth a rental and that's it. Rating 610".

Gary Gray is at the helm for this film that is clearly a sequel of Get Shorty a much better film than this mess.Elmore Leonard's novels are filled with interesting characters from the underworld. As seen in better adaptations of his books some of those guys have been given life by among others Samuel L. Jackson who has made the most out of those foolish mobsters.Even John Travolta who repeats his role of Chili Palmer is not as effective as in the previous film. In fact his character doesn't resonate with most of the viewers. Uma Thurman a beautiful woman is not at her best either. The most obnoxious characters in the film are played by Vince Vaughn and Andre Benjamin who clearly appears to take an urgent trip to an acting coach to help him if he wants to stay in movies. Mr. Vaughn is not funny as Raji who acts black without having a clue of how to go about it.

	schema:reviewBody "Sometimes when I hear an Alist cast will be bunched up together for 2 hours in a movie I hope and pray that it is good not for the sake of my 10 bucks or 2 hours but for the sake of these actors' careers. In the case of Be Cool everything went to waste.In the beginning of the film John Travolta aka Chili Palmer and a music executive played by James Woods are driving in a car talking about movie sequels and how most aren't good. If you look passed the fact that this scene was shot the same way Quentin Tarrantino filmed his car scene in Pulp Fiction and listen to the dialogue you can't help but ponder whether this is 1 a disclaimer to the audience that this movie is going to suck or 2 an attempt to get the audience laughing at the sheer humor of 2 people talking about sequels in a sequel. Oh the irony! In case you were wondering choice 1 is correct. The cool and slick Chili Palmer from the first and good film Get Shorty is revived to play a mobster gone music business pro. He steals a young hot singer Christina Milian from her ghetto pimped out Jewish manager Vince Vaughn and turns her into a singing sensation. Of course a movie about an exmobster can never be complete without new mobsters causing havoc. This time around the mobsters of choice are Russian played by American actors who cannot act Russian if my entire family hit them upside the head with their Russian bare hands.As a Russian I wasn't so much offended by the way this film portrayed Russians but instead as a writer I was more offended by the horrible dialogue. This film tried too hard to get the audience to laugh. It turned potentially good lines into a redundancy. The Russian black and gay jokes were the same ones only reworded a couple of hundred times. After calling The Rock's character a f he plays a gay bodyguard to Vince Vaughn and Cedric the Entertainerer's character a n he played a black rapper with an entourage who threaten those who don't play his tracks with guns I wanted to walk out of the movie theater because it was painful to sit through. If this was Get Shorty none of this would've even needed to be in the film to build up drama or a really bad laugh.What lacked in this film that didn't in Get Shorty was Chili's hot spicey attitude. He's a completely different person in this sequel. For one thing the old Chili would've had more dialogue. John Travolta doesn't have more than 20 speaking lines in Be Cool because he is out staged by the repetitive lines and the hundred and two cameo appearances by the most random celebrities. I won't ruin the shock by revealing all of the cameos for those who actually plan to see this movie PLEASE DON'T!!! but I will say that it will forever amaze me that these people agreed to be in a film of such inanity.What was even more stupid was the very lame dance sequence with Travolta and Uma Thurman she plays the widower of James Woods who LUCKILY gets killed in the first 10 minutes of the movie. Tarrantino never made Pulp Fiction for an idiot like the director of Be Cool to mess around with. This dance number was boring long and just plain throbbing. The Black Eyed Peas playing in the club with a total of 10 people didn't make the scene any memorable.There were so many plot holes that I left the theater asking myself WHY?! Everything about this film was a big question mark. I just didn't understand the point to anything. I couldn't even explain to you why the Russians were after everyone or why this film was ever made because I'm baffled. All I took out of this movie was that everyone in L.A. has a sidekick and the only way this movie was probably funded was through all of the advertisements by Diet Coke Yahoo! Honda Insight Hybrid TMobile Trimspa even the spokeswoman herself is in the movie and the Bad Screenwriters Guild. Plot holes stupid dialogue too many random cameos horrible acting even by the pros and a notsoentertaining attempt to mimic Pulp Fiction makes this film the worst movie of 2005 and it's only the third month of the year.".

The only credit I can give it is going far beyond my expectations of that hatred.I find that there are absolutely no redeeming qualities about this film. It is two hours worth of nothing happening. I think more happened in that Aviator movie even when nothing was happening in it. All I gathered from this film was that the key to success is buying a Tmobile phone and drinking diet pepsi. If I wanted to spend 10 watching coked out rock musicians try their last hurrah... I could go see Whitesnake right here in town. In Get Shorty Dare I mention that film here the characters actually had.. well character and fresh dialog. In this steaming coil of cinema they have well.. The same dialog sans character.As far as the acting is concerned I whole heartedly believe that no one in this film was trying. John Travolta the forlorn star of days past reduced himself to playing a lesser version of a character played by a real actor decades ago. Uma Thurman who dazzled us all a while backwas obviously reading her terrible candy machine dialog off of the back of her large check. But to her credit she didn't have much to do what with there being no plot and all. Aside from the two leads I think the rest of the ensemble did a bang up job with the amazing screenplay courtesy of Peter 'Euripides' Steindfeld of 'Analyze That' fame masterpiece.Get Shorty had 2 things that made it above the rest Barry Sonnenfeld and Elmore Leonard. As far as directing goes all I can say is... F. Gary Fuing Gray!!!! C'mon! In summary If I had the intent of watching two hours of bad music and mind numbing commercialism I would have stayed home and watched MTV. Avoid this film at all costs.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first film was good record producer Tommy Athens James Woods tells Chili Palmer John Travolta in the opening minutes of Be Cool. Sequels stink they're merely made for corporate profit Chili adds.Tommy and Chili of course refer to Get Leo the film Chili helped produce in Get Shorty 1995. Now when we see Chili he's recovering from the lambasting the sequel Get Lost received a sequel he didn't want to make. It's a cute joke to start Be Cool. But it doesn't excuse director F. Gary Gray and writer Peter Steinfeld for making a horribly turgid and miserably unfunny sequel.Gray and Steinfeld have successfully stripped all the humor and attitude out of Elmore Leonard's novel which provided many laughs. Chili's involvement in the music business was his way to also get back into the movie business as he went about making a movie of what he was doing. All that has been omitted from the movie Be Cool. The problem undoubtedly is Steinfeld's script. Leonard's characters have attitude charm charisma verve. Screenwriter Scott Frank brilliantly captured the essence of those people in Get Shorty. Frank also found similar success adapting Leonard's Out of Sight for director Steven Soderbergh in 1998. Frank's impressive filmography includes Dead Again 1991 and this year's The Interpreter. On the other hand Steinfeld's contributions to cinema  Drowning Mona 2000 and the horribly unfunny sequel Analyze That 2002. And in Be Cool he doesn't get a single character right. The dialogue falls flat too.No one seems to be having any fun in Be Cool. They all seem to be taking themselves far too seriously and trying too hard to be funny. There's an embarrassingly lame dance sequence between Chili and Edie Athens Uma Thurman as if the filmmakers are trying to rekindle the magic the two actors generated in Pulp Fiction 1994. But this scene goes nowhere as does a pointless cameo by Danny De Vito. His appearance only reminds us what a gem Get Shorty was and how we longed for Gene Hackman Rene Russo and James Gandolfini in Be Cool. Thurman looks sensational in a bikini but there's nothing more to her character. Travolta such a joy in Get Shorty seems thoroughly bored and even the usually reliable Harvey Keitel is dull.We're also saddled with Cedric the Entertainer Andre Benjamin The Rock and Vince Vaughn who has rater speedily become one of the most annoying actors. The other day I realized I've enjoyed him in just two films  Swingers 1996 and Clay Pigeons 1998. In Be Cool a miscast Vaughn plays a Jewish manager who acts black. This could be funny if Vaughn didn't grate on us. This chap doesn't know how to act anymore  every character he plays turns into an irritating caricature with no depth. Vaughn's fast becoming a reason not to see a movie.The charm of Get Shorty was that Chili realized the skills he gained being a mobster fit ideally into him becoming a movie producer. But the music business doesn't provide him with such comedy. In Leonard's novel Be Cool Linda Moon the young singer Chili befriends was sassy smug vivacious and fun. She had character charm. In the film Linda's Christina Milian as pedestrian and forgettable as every American Idol performer. There's nothing unique about her absolutely nothing charming. Why she would captivate Chili is a mystery. And in the film's biggest mistake Steinfeld treats Linda's rise to stardom seriously. What was he thinking?Everything that's wrong about Be Cool is crystallized when Chili waxes poetic about the reasoning behind one of Aerosmith's classic songs. The moment isn't played for laughs it's treated as serious and emotionally heavy. Right there you realize Steinfeld and Gary had no idea how to approach Leonard's novel to give it the touch it required. I very well might see a worse film than Be Cool this year. But I doubt I'll be as disappointed.".

I'm usually a fan of clever reference but in Be Cool they mostly fell flat. This movie had four music numbers a dance sequence and a montage. It was less a whole film and more a meaningless parade of cameos. The writing was pretty bad and most of the performances were desperate and awkwardnotably Steven Tyler. Duane Johnson stood out in a movie full of celebrities as he obviously had a really good time acting and he was fun to watch. All told I would have a hard time recommending this film.".

He is not happy with how his career in the movies is going and decides to branch off in the music industry. It is in a somewhat seedy bar that Chili discovers Linda Moon Christina Milian working in a trio. Linda has a strong singing voice but is obviously going nowhere within her group. The movie is basically centered around Linda and her contract. Everybody seems to want it now that Chili has plans and knows what a talent she is.Getting all the characters onscreen spread them all out a little bit thin with some barely getting any screen time at all. Most of the better characters got more screen time than I thought they would have. Thankfully the great chemistry between Vince Vaughn and The Rock gets quite a bit of screen time. Another newcomer who delivers a surprising performance is Andr Benjamin or Andr 3000 as Dabu. Dabu is one of the many in Sin LaSalle's Cedric The Entertainer entourage along with many very large men.There are many more actors and actresses in this cast but the best characters were those mentioned above. Dustin Hoffman pulled off a great performance as usual but even he seemed overshadowed by the rest of the cast. Uma Thurman Steven Tyler Danny DeVito James Woods Harvey Keitel and many others round off this great cast. I doubt all these actors would commit to something as horrible as we are all led to believe.The Rock is starting to branch out with his acting range. His big gay bodyguard routine was hilarious as I doubt I'll ever forget his rendition of You're Not Woman Enough To Take My Man. Rock and Vince Vaughn as the wannabe pimp complimented each other perfectly and along with Cedric they are the highlights of the movie. Also Christina Milian looks to be one of the hotter new actresses on her way up and I was impressed by what I assume was her lipsyncing performance with Steven Tyler. Look for her to be around for awhile.This was a large cast and for the most part they all held their own. My honest review is that this movie is better than it is being given credit for possibly due to the incredible amount of hype put into it turning many viewers against it. I went into this movie with an open mind and not expecting a great movie and I came out entertained. Because of this I can recommend this movie with a clear conscience.".

While dismissive in the moment the director is haunted by the idea and a journalist friend suggests the film could take off from his experience interviewing a very young prostitute. We then enter the prostitute's story and it's intentionally never fully clear if what we're seeing is the film that arose from the concept or the truth of the girl's life. Beautifully photographed and full of inventive touches the main credits are spoken not seen over a long tracking shot of a dark cobblestone street I was also surprised that it contained more of a dark sense of humor about itself and the world then most critics acknowledge. In turn that keeps the film's occasional youthful overobsession with despair from ever feeling unbearably sophomoric. I will admit it lost steam for me in the last third some of the performers aren't quite up to the heavy burdens of the script and a few sequences are awkward and bespeak Bergman's comparative youth.

They thankfully did not remake this original film because this film stands on its own as extremely entertaining and as a fascinating glimpse into the last carefree days of filmmaking in the Weimar Republic.  It is an incredible record of its era. Much of the dialogue is spoken in verse and very cleverly I might add! and there are musical numbers that make one reflect on both the Busby Berkeley musicals of 1930s Hollywood and of the film CABARET made decades later.  The cast is exemplary.  Renate Muller should have been a bigger star than Marlene Dietrich and it's exciting to see Anton Walbrook looking younger and more dashing than ever.  The film doesn't go into the same risque sexual identity antics that VICTORVICTORIA went into but it still provides some amusing turns on gender roleplaying including a hilarious scene where Viktoria gets a shave.  It is just a pure delight all the way through and fans of VICTORVICTORIA will enjoy making comparisons.".

The singing is from the 30's so they have that warble that you heard in Disney's Snow White. And the movie has a lot of slapstick filler. Many times Viktor is unnecessarily a dufus. I have a sparse German vocabulary and am lucky most of the characters spoke slowly or at least used basic statements. There is also a smidgen of English including a song about Spain. The film would have been easer to follow if Deutsch subtitles were available. The DVD I Watched is region 2 from Black Hill Pictures GmbH.

After all the plot has a lot of elements of tranvestism and possible homosexualitysubjects the new Reich would never allow in theaters. But in 1933 the Nazis just came to power and were slowly consolidating their power and were not yet a dictatorship so such a movie was released to theaters and was a success. In fact the director ALSO filmed a French language versionwith the same sets but with different leading actors. In fact the film worked so well that the Brit made their own version First a Girl just two years laterand of the three I definitely prefer the British remake. And speaking of remakes Hollywood remade this decades later as VictorVictoria.Vikor und Viktoria is a musicalbut not in the way the British film was made. Instead of having a lot of kitschy musical numbers which I loved like the British film much of the song consisted of sung dialog. It worked okaybut the lyrics lacked the humor of the British ones. Additionally the gay aspects of the film were REALLY deemphasized perhaps to kiss up to the new Nazi regimemaking Viktor somehow more 'butch'.The film begins with Susanne trying unsuccessfully to get a job as a singer. Though she has a lovely job it doesn't seem to mater. And after she and Viktor both lose jobs the same day they meet up and become friends. Unfortunately soon Viktor loses his voiceand this is a serious problem since he had another interview. So he has an idea Susanne should try out in his place. What's the role? He's trying out as a man who dresses and pretends to be a womanonly Susanne now has to pretend to be a man pretending to be a woman! It's all confusing...and rather cute. But the characters and plot to me were missing something. It wasn't only the music but the British version was just more likable and sweet. This one in contrast looked a bit flat.

One of the characters says to Jessie Mathews Victor as a man At first you didn't strike me as the type of man who'd be interested in that sort of thing meaning marriage you know in girls. to which Jessie Victor replies Oh! But I am! The premise of all three of these films is quite complex and truly funny. A real woman falls on hard times and meets a somefilms gay somefilms not man who shows her how to work the circuit and get a meal or two for free etc.Then the man who is by day a gentleman an by night a female impersonator gets sick and his new friend has to go on in his stead. She does a smashing job and they are quickly offered a contract they cannot refuse  now all they have to do is convince the world that out of that dress and that wig SHE'S really a HE... and calamity ensues.I hope you enjoy!

I disagree with another reviewer who said that the UK version doesn't have any hint of homosexuality in it. One of the characters says to Jessie Mathews Victor as a man At first you didn't strike me as the type of man who'd be interested in that sort of thing meaning marriage you know in girls. to which Jessie Victor replies Oh! But I am! The premise of all three of these films is quite complex and truly funny. A real woman falls on hard times and meets a somefilms gay somefilms not man who shows her how to work the circuit and get a meal or two for free etc.Then the man who is by day a gentleman an by night a female impersonator gets sick and his new friend has to go on in his stead. She does a smashing job and they are quickly offered a contract they cannot refuse  now all they have to do is convince the world that out of that dress and that wig SHE'S really a HE... and calamity ensues.I hope you enjoy!

	schema:reviewBody "Viktor und Viktoria or Viktor and Viktoria is a German blackandwhite sound movie from 1933 so this one will soon have its 85th anniversary. The writer and director is Reinhold Schnzel a really successful and prolific actor as well and it is probably his most known work behind the camera. Same can probably be said for lead actress Renate Mller and this may also have to do with her very early death. Hermann Thimig who plays the male title character appeared in a couple other pretty wellknown films and lived until into his 90s. The rest of the cast I cannot say I am familiar with. Nonetheless this film or this story was successful enough for this film to be remade on many occasions in all kinds of countries including a Hollywood movie that was even a big player at the Academy Awards many decades later.But lets take a look at this one here. I cannot say I am too impressed unfortunately. I found it a very mediocre movie overall in terms of music acting and most of all the plot. The story was maybe good enough for 40 minutes but not for almost 1 hour and 40 minutes. Apart from that the crossdressing humor becomes repetitive at some point I have to say because there is nothing else to it they just rely on the costumes and makeup to be enough and it is not especially not in the days when we can't see color which is of course a factual description and you cannot blame anybody for it. I can see however how the Nazis probably have not liked this film a lot as they certainly did not see any fun or comedy in the issue of men dressing as women or the other way around. In my opinion it is simply not enough for me to like a film just because the Nazis hated it and I believe that's the approach many people are giving it. I am also looking for interesting character development and real depth when it comes to the story and character backgrounds. So yeah all in all this film is not a failure but it is also quite a bit away in terms of quality from a level where I would recommend the watch. I give it a thumbsdown and suggest you watch something else instead maybe unless you really love another version of it and are curious about this 1930s approach to the subject.".

First of all I must say I don't speak a word of German Jawohl and two or three other words so right there I'm totally handicapped to dare to judged this film since the copy I saw didn't have any kind of subtitles.I saw years ago the American version with Julie Andrews A Goddess Lesley Ann Warren the funniest Gun Moll in the history of movie making and that unique immense actor Robert Preston although to be fair with that production EVERYBODY in it was sensational!! and more or less it gave me some hints of what was going on in this 1932 version. But let's consider the acting and the situations at least as a silent movie The whole thing looks extremely dated exaggerated gestures almost circus like acting a girl Renate Mller so curvaceous that will make her impossible to pass for a boy Impressive knockers the one in the middle was her head an alien way to tell the story almost unbearable to a contemporary audience etc.Again I hate to offend a German audience that maybe delighted just in listening to their mother tongue no doubt full of exquisite nuances and as several mentioned spoken in metric verse. I would feel the same if the actors were speaking some of the few languages I command but unfortunately German is not among them.To me it's a very old fashion film that doesn't compare at all with the newer Julie Andrews version and her sensational interpretation.

They tend to do as many things wrong as right. Godsend has some admirable script characteristics a good to great cast and some very good technical aspects. But it also has negative script characteristics and some questionable directing and editing.Overall I believe Godsend is worth watching so let's look at the positive points first. It's rare that filmic science fictionand this is just as much as science fiction film as a thriller or horror filmtries to tackle hard science as exposition and motivation. Although Godsend also mixes some strong fantasy elements into its twist and the consequences that lead to the film being a thrillerhorror picture the basic idea is one rooted in actual genetics. De Niro is given quite a few mouthfuls of scienceoriented dialogue that are fairly sound and for my money he delivers them well.I'm a big fan of De Niro's so I tend to be gracious in my evaluation of his work. But I could see where some viewers less enamored with De Niro overall might find his performance here questionable. It's certainly a bit different than normal being oddly restrained and almost emotionless for much of the film. For me that approach fit the character given his profession and eventual revelations about his personality. The other three principlesKinnear RomijnStamos and Brightwere good in my view but again I can see where some viewers could interpret their performances negatively. To me however all of the obvious problems stem from direction and editing not the actors' work.The biggest problem seems to stem from director Nick Hamm's comments about the horrorthriller genre. He has stated what was interesting to me about Godsend was that the horror and the suspense had nothing to do with anything supernatural or spiritual. Hamm isn't a very big fan of the fantasy aspect of horror which to me translates into not being a very big horror fan. This led to trying to create a horror film where suspense arises out of realist drama and psychological situations. The realist drama in Godsend tends to be very slow and relatively uneventfuljust as one might expect from someone not really wanting to make a horror film. Psychological horror is barely approached. There just isn't enough that happens. There are two potential villains but neither does much. It would be very difficult to call either evil.Kinnear and RomijnStamos aren't given enough to work with. They don't have anything very meaty to react to. Hamm seems too afraid to leave realist drama territory at least in terms of the overall plotaction. That makes some of their horrified reactions seem shallow or false. Worse Hamm doesn't seem to know how to cut horror films very well. Scenes go on far longer than they should and occasionally almost seem as if we're seeing a bit of the footage either before Hamm said Action or after he called Cut. A prime example of this is the scene near the end when RomijnStamos is walking through woods toward a shed.Godsend is also one of the few cases where copious DVD extras may have hurt the film more than helped. The DVD contains four alternate endings averaging about 12 minutes long each. These occasionally deviate strongly from the theatrical ending but none seem quite satisfying all of the more nihilistic endings that Hamm described on his commentary but which apparently weren't shot would have done the trick for me I also liked the filmed tag suggesting a sequel. They all tend to drag on an impression that isn't helped by the lack of a score and a sound effects soundtrack.Also curious given Hamm's dislike of the fantasy aspects of genre films is the fact that the crux of the twist in Godsend is extremely loopy. What's happening with Adam makes little sense from a realisticscientific standpoint and how it happened just isn't possible. Of course I'm not averse to fantasy and I don't subtract points for elements in film that are wildly divergent from our beliefs and understanding of the actual world. But if Hamm is going to abandon realism when it comes to important plot points why not abandon it wholesale so that we can maybe see a film that deserves an A instead?".

	schema:reviewBody "I liked the premise although the character development was pretty nonexistent. Even affable ever likable Greg Kinnear came off as completely onedimensional. You just couldn't empathize with anybody in this movie.The only thing I'll say about Rebecca Romijn Stamos is that I really wish this useless piece of fluff would stop getting acting roles just because she's pretty.I did enjoy some of the symbolism ie. the little boy's name being Adam the fight in the church where the Bible gets burned etc. But I felt the ending was redundant. They had a perfect opportunity to end it with a great final statement but instead they chose to drag it out another minute. The final closeting of whatever remained of the boy Adam would have been perfect. If you've seen the film you know what I'm talking about.The moral question posed by the film is just because we can do something does that mean we should? In fact Robert DeNiro's character actually utters this albeit in reverse. If I'm not supposed to do it then how come I can? he says. But this question is ultimately obscured by the film's reliance on horror movie conventions. In short this could have been a great movie about the moral problems posed by human cloning. Instead it's a C movie about a creepy mad scientist and a creepier kid. Worth seeing but only for a three dollar rental.".

You just couldn't empathize with anybody in this movie.The only thing I'll say about Rebecca Romijn Stamos is that I really wish this useless piece of fluff would stop getting acting roles just because she's pretty.I did enjoy some of the symbolism ie. the little boy's name being Adam the fight in the church where the Bible gets burned etc. But I felt the ending was redundant.

	schema:reviewBody "I mainly decided to see this movie because Robert De Niro is in it.  He's on my top ten list of alltime favorite actors.  Having seen the movie though I now believe that De Niro really needs a new agent.This is a truly awful film I find it hard to say anything good about it at all.  The acting is terrible.  Greg Kinnear turns in one of the most cardboard performances I've seen in a cinematic release leaving what should be a sympathetic character absolutely devoid of life.  Stamos brings about as much flavor to her role as one would expect from a slice of white bread. Even De Niro appears to be phoning it in for most of this flick which is perhaps the most disappointing aspect of this dreck.  I kept waiting for De Niro to break out but it never happened.  I haven't seen every one of his films but this is the worst performance of any that I have.  Such a great talent put to such obvious waste!  He really is completely unconvincing as a scientist.  Even the child actor who portrays AdamZachary seem flat and off the mark throughout the film.Luckily the actors involved with this mess can at least blame the writers who have certainly given us a swiss cheese film full of plot holes and some of the most clichd lines one could imagine.  The bit with Zachary Clark's former nanny is a particularly terrible example of this.The story itself betrays a tremendous or perhaps willful misunderstanding of cloning and genetics.  It isn't possible to clone things like personality cognition and memory.  None of those things are genetic in and of themselves.  Morality cannot be reproduced on a chromosome.  This is perhaps the biggest flaw of the story it's all based on something so absolutely ridiculous that anyone who paid attention in high school biology class should be able to see clear through this fundamental plot device.POSSIBLE SPOILER FOLLOWSThere are likewise a few glaring continuity problems.  For example in one scene we see Greg Kinnear lying on the floor in a burning church.  He's unconscious having just had the back of his head smashed in enough to produce a rather copious flow of blood.  Moments later he's rescuing his wife in the cellar of their home.  How does a man with an obviously fractured skull simply get up get into a car and drive home and not even look a little woozy?  Why isn't he covered with soot from the burning church?  In fact if the smashedin skull didn't kill him he should certainly have died from smoke inhalation.  Furthermore the church was filled with people who were about to leave for a funeral nearby.  Where'd they all go?  Didn't any of them notice the plumes of smoke rising from the church at the end of the De NiroKinnear scene?  Did they all simply vanish like any possible credibility in the storyline?There is not a single strong element to this movie.  The cinematography is mediocre the soundtrack is bland and there really is no reason to spend good money seeing it.  Without a doubt this is the most disappointing major film I've seen so far this year.  It's certainly no Godsend for anyone who was involved with or who has seen this terrible terrible movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "We've all lost somebody close to us at some point in our lives whether it be a parent a grandparent cousin a friend a wife or a girlfriend it's happened to everyone. But for a parent to lose a child especially in the prime of their life has to be one of the most horrible experiences a parent can endure. The whole concept of the parent outliving the child is just so radically outrageous that no normal human being could ever fathom how such a person would feel unless they themselves lost a child. In years past one would lose a loved one the time of grieving would take its course and then that would be that. But times have changed and so have the methods of science where a person would lose a loved one forever now the deceased can be brought back to life through the experimental method of cloning or at least that is the thought. Sounds more like some ungodly sciencefiction novel right? Not anymore. Now that scientists have experimented on everything from sheep to mice to rabbits they now want to move on to humans with some radical and inscrutable groups claiming they have already achieved the unthinkable  the birth of the first clone human being. Sooner or later the moral convictions of mankind will contend with radical science to determine whether or not man can conquer death.The story centers on a couple who decide to take the advice of a radical scientist and have their dead child cloned in order to return to their once happy life. Jesse and Paul may not have the most high paying jobs the best house or even the best neighborhood but there is one thing in there life that they would never be able to live without their son Adam. Things within the Duncan household seem to be looking up with Paul being offered a better job which would require the family to move to a better quality neighborhood. But life takes a tragic turn when just a day after his eighth birthday Adam is fatally injured in a car accident and dies practically in his mother's arms. With their whole world turned upsidedown and memories of their dead son everywhere in their home the couple turn to Dr. Richard Wells a radical genetics researcher who claims to be able to take cells from the body of their dead son place them in an egg from Jesse and produce an identical version of Adam. All the couple would need to do is move into a new house graciously provide by Dr. Wells himself and promise not to tell anyone about the controversial procedure they are about to embark on. Once Adam is reborn' the couple's life returns back to way things were before the accident  that is until young Adam crosses the age at which the original Adam died. From there the child has sleepless nights a sudden lapse in emotions and disturbing nightterrors that both frighten and confuse his parents. Could this be their just punishment for venturing into the realm of God or is there something else behind Adam's bewildering behavior? The story of Godsend is nothing more then a halfassed attempt at copying true a horror classic Rosemary's Baby and even The Others. What starts out as an intriguing insight into the moral and ethical complications behind the concept of cloning turns into an uneven and flat attempt at cheap thrills that leaves you with more question then when you started with.The cast is mainly centered on only four characters and unfortunately for the film only one performs up to the standards expected of the moviegoing public. Despite the fact that Robert DeNiro's character is a great opportunity for the outstanding veteran actor to add madscientistresearcher to his resume the audience doesn't get as much of him as they would want which is sad since he is the only truly interesting character in the film. The filmmakers could have done a much better job at providing more information on character even if it was just revealed at the end of the film but they don't even do that. It is an absolutely pathetic sight to see the best thing a film has going for it based on the cast leave you totally confused based on his actions since no motivation or reasons are given to you for him doing what he has done within the course of the two hour feature. Rebecca RomijnStamos who has really built up her film career over the past couple of years is once again reduced to the secondhand eye candy is this film including a scene where she is walking through the house in a white seethrough sweatshirt that clearly shows her without a bra which is just an absolute embarrassment to see in a film now adays  Come on people! Grow up! Greg Kinnear is pretty convincing as Paul Duncan but the character itself is a problem. He's a biologist but it takes him the longest time to figure out the thought that what may be wrong with the new Adam may be in his genes. Where did he get his college degree from? And Cameron Bright who plays both the original and cloned version of Adam Duncan attempts to come off as a creepycute kid but there nothing creepy or cutesy about him he's just plain annoying. His possessed' child voice and deep stares into absolutely nothingness feel like complete ripoffs of classic horror films and not good ones at that.Overall what should be a film attempting to answer the moral and ethical issues brought up the revolutionary concept of human cloning only leaves you with the question of why you would pay eight dollars for an unimaginative and bewildering horror knockoff. Even if you go into this film giving the filmmakers the benefit of the doubt for rippingoff Rosemary's Baby you'll still have problems with the film's uneven and utterly confusing second half. There are so many things wrong with this film that it is hard to decide where to start. Let's first focus on the reason why the couple would want to clone their son in the first place. The subject is brought up early in the film but the wife refuses to have another child and pushes the husband toward the cloning concept. If they had left it at that then that would be fine but later on in the film they show the couple having sex before being broken up by the screams of their cloned son. Oh! You're opposed to the having a child through moral methods but not to having the occasional winkwink'? Another problem is that the film tends to throw bits and pieces of religion into the film's background the most obvious being the Godsend Institute' and yet the question of morals and ethics within a religious context are clearly excluded from almost any conversations. And how unsatisfying and completely confusing can you make an ending for a film that was practically a waste of time to begin with? Somehow the filmmakers managed to screw that up as well without giving anything away practically nothing is answered. What prevented this film from getting an absolute failure would have to be its intriguing first half and engaging performance from Robert DeNiro but not even those things can resurrect this beaten and bloody horse picture.My Rating  out of 5 Grade D".

An exercise in how to completely antagonise an audience. The thing appears to be the result of almost dailyrewrites and a veritable congaline of replaced directors It wasn't In support of the theory the makers had no idea what they were trying to achieve the DVD itself has no less than FOUR alternate endings  three of which are better than the theatrical release.The end result is neither scary horrific edgy...or even interesting! Up until the Hey have I got a cloning offer for you? sequence the flick had possibilities  not many admittedly...but some at least! You've got De Niro spouting epithets of medical babble but at least looking purposeful. Kinnear with all the charisma of a dead lemur and the ever statuesque Rebecca RomijnStamos taking up the slack as Adam's mom. Speaking of Adam Cameron Bright...has any kid ever had less cinematic appeal? When all is said and done.....nothing much is explained and the film simply stops rather than ends. Personally I think the IMDb's 4.7 is overly kind!".

	onyx:emotionText "If you want to watch the Godsend go dig out the original 1980 flick. Although not quite the same story  it leaves this for dead! An exercise in how to completely antagonise an audience. The thing appears to be the result of almost dailyrewrites and a veritable congaline of replaced directors It wasn't In support of the theory the makers had no idea what they were trying to achieve the DVD itself has no less than FOUR alternate endings  three of which are better than the theatrical release.The end result is neither scary horrific edgy...or even interesting! Up until the Hey have I got a cloning offer for you? sequence the flick had possibilities  not many admittedly...but some at least! You've got De Niro spouting epithets of medical babble but at least looking purposeful. Kinnear with all the charisma of a dead lemur and the ever statuesque Rebecca RomijnStamos taking up the slack as Adam's mom. Speaking of Adam Cameron Bright...has any kid ever had less cinematic appeal? When all is said and done.....nothing much is explained and the film simply stops rather than ends. Personally I think the IMDb's 4.7 is overly kind!";

In fact 'Godsend The' brings to the cinema a very special and delicate question is the genetic research a good option to mankind or a disaster in an ethical point of consideration? The question is a good one but the answer suggested by the movie is full of prejudice and simpleminded considerations. As a movie 'Godsend The' is a trifle material.

He's nowhere near as bad as I expected him to be after reading all the reviews though.Kinnear and Stamos try their best but the movie just isn't up to par at all. Nick Hamm is a really worthless director and the DVD's ten gazillion special multiple endings are each more insulting than the last.You know a movie is in trouble when it has separate endings  this one has about twenty too many.

However tragedy strikes when Adam is killed in a car accident right in front of Jessie leaving the couple broken and lost. At their lowest point they are met by a former tutor of Jessie's enigmatic doctor Richard Wells. Infamous for this genetic work Wells claims that he can use DNA from the dead Adam to essentially produce a clone. With Jessie no longer able to have children the couple agree to the illegal and experimental procedure which also involves moving to a big empty house and the new born is soon with them. All is great until Adam reaches eight years old and suddenly the nightmares starts and Adam's behaviour changes.A few years ago cloning became a hot topic and produced several interesting debates over the moral and ethical issues surrounding it. There were no easy answers and it wasis a topic that is hard to hold a clear view on unless you happen to have it decided for you by your religion. Writer Bomback takes this interesting hotbed of ethical debate and churns out a modern twist on the Omen with few original ideas and nothing of any real interest. The plot just tries to engineer plenty of creepy moments with the thinnest of ideas behind them and as a result I didn't really care that much about any of it. Hamm's solid direction is OK but he can't add much in the way of real chills.Kinnear and Romijn make for an unlikely couple and they don't have a very convincing relationship. Neither of them have much to work with they do the basics with the script but they can't raise it and don't even suggest that they would produce the sort of emotions you'd expect from a couple seeing their dead son recreated in front of them. Bright is suitably creepy and he does what is asked of him  the rest isn't his fault. De Niro phones in his performance he isn't terrible but you can't help feel that he is worth more than this and that he surely can't need the money that much.Overall then a roundly poor chiller that offers very little other than unimaginative and unoriginal ideas. Not chilling in the least and it just plods its way towards a pointless and annoying conclusion.".

Sure far more academic subjects have been made into riveting dramas. Could it have attracted a cast as usually talented as this? Certainly. But no instead they went for a rehash of 1950's fear of science gone awry fluff cinema. This marks yet another low point in De Niro's career. Did his house need a new coat of paint? Why did he take this role and why then did he choose to sleep walk through it?The bottom line is movie audiences aren't stupid give us some real issues in realistic situations and we will reward you for it. This film opts to do neither and then even fails as a mindless thriller since the audience can see the ending coming 45 minutes into the picture.".

Warning people that are offended by SPOILERS in advance I will discuss plotpoints that may not be fun to know of before viewing the film. Zachary spelled correctly is where the film starts to fall. As soon as the clich ghost story elements of it takes off you're in for something you've seen many times before. Come on! This is so lame you're asking yourself if the original writer was fired because of creative differences and then replaced by Ehren Kruger to finish the job. The film now changes from cloningthriller to splitpersonality horror without the horror. Everything goes wrong here trust me. The DVD has four alternate endings to prove it.Should I have had the power to influence the director's choices before final cut had I been given the chance I would have preferred a variation of ending number three here! Why not just have the father strangle the damn kid? Can I say that? Nothing against Cameron Bright he was great so was the rest of the cast but did they read the whole thing before they signed on? I don't know. Having father strangle son and then go directly to end credits would be a totally satisfying way to end it. Think about it! They go through all the trouble of cloning their dead son and then watches him grow up to be a freak sneaking up behind his parents scaring them and killing classmates left to right. I'm telling you this should never had been done and the only way to make it right would be to slip that rope around his neck. The funny thing is that even this feels like a bad clich.Having said that what did I like about it part from the first 40 minutes or so of the film and the terrific cast? How about the music! This score is sooo great! I love this!! Brian Tyler is the most competent guy on the crew here. Fantastic! Brians music set to the opening credits by the VFX crew really got me!In short Great film great cast great music great VFX opening credits but not so great script. Did they do test screenings at all?".

	schema:reviewBody "Following the death of their eight year old son on his birthday Jessie RomijnStamos and Paul Kinnear are befriended by a doctor on the forefront of genetic research DeNiro at the height of their mourning. He leads the couple in a desperate attempt to reverse the rules of nature and clone their son. The experiment is successful and under Richard's watchful eye Adam grows into a healthy and happy young boy until his 8th birthday. As time goes by the Duncan's gradually start to see small subtle differences between the new Adam and the Adam they lost. At the time of the new Adam's eighth birthday the changes in character are more pronounced. Adam grows distant and fearful as a palpable sense of menace settles within the young boy. This Adam begins to suffer from night terrors and frightening flashbacks as a sinister personality begins to emerge. Paul and Jessie cannot escape the fact that this Adam is different. Terror settles on the couple as they try to come to terms with just what they have done or what has been done to them. I rented Godsend on DVD this afternoon expecting the worst. I was pleasantly surprised.Fantastic performances an intelligent script beautiful photography unpredictable plot twist after the next. A very pleasant surprise indeed and a very positive step in the world of horror! Sure it wasn't the least bit scary and the fright scenes were entirely generic but it was a very intelligent film and really kept my attention. Good for anyone looking for a smart thoughtprovoking film that doesn't rely on special effects 810.ABOUT THE DVD Lion's Gate has given Godsend a very good treatment. The 2.351 widescreen presentation is flawlessbeautiful colors virtually NO compression artifacts sold blacks no grain or dirt. Audio is equally impressive. For extras we get a commentary by The director and director of photography. This is an informative track but it's very drab. Perhaps a couple of cast members could have livened it up a bit. Next up are 4 alternate endings all of which have their pro's and con's though it's obvious why they were cut. A commentary buy the writer and director is also available for all 4. last of all are some storyboards which I didn't have time to watch. The film is also adequately closed captioned. My rating for the DVD 710.".

Then we have Rebecca Romijn and Cameron Bright. Neither are fine or particularly notable for any reason other than being bad actors.A movie fails utterly when you feel no emotional attachment to any of it's characters and that is one of the huge flaws in this movie. Adam acts way too cutesy. if he was my kid i would be inclined to hit him occasionally to put some meanness in him. Seriously.Don't read any further if for some reason you actually want to see this movie and don't want to know what happens.At any rate by the time he gets hit by the car i was Begging for something to happen. Rebecca is a terrible mother who lets her 10 year old go mincing about outside near a busy street unsupervised. yes I'm one of those people who snickers at the trailerpark resident who lost their house to a tornado. What did you expect? You live in Indiana and have no basement....Deniro shows up out of nowhere to offer them the chance to resurrect their kid via cloning. Predictably the kid somehow starts to grow up JUST LIKE the one he was cloned from completely throwing out the fact that nature AND nurture determine how a kid will develop.I'll skip through the rest of it. It has an ungodly long build up to NOTHING. Deniro gets pissy with Kinear for him suggesting that what he did was wrong and then chastises him for doing it in the first place like he knew it was a bad idea but offered it to them anyway.We find out the kid has been hallucinating and is maybe a reincarnation or something of Deniro's dead kid who was a rotten little psycho. by the end i was just begging for it to be over.it has a very What the hell? ending where we see that all of the build up in the movie led up to nothing. the filmmakers here should be slapped with an old dead fish for this.".

	schema:reviewBody "Swades was released in December 2004 and since then this project was said to be considered by the director Ashutosh Gowariker. The director of movies such as Laagan and Swades has once again left no stones unturned and proved that he is also capable of directing a movie related the colossal personality  Akbar the Great also known as Jalaludin Mohammed Akbar. A young Akbar sets out to conquer Kingdoms and those who don't join him are brutally executed but after a while he begins to pardon them and that's when many of his opponents begin to realise that they had and have misunderstood him. One particular Rajput Raja Bharmal instead of facing the Moghul's mighty army decides that it would be better that his daughter Raj Kumari Jodhaa Bai who is be throned to another Rajput Prince marries Akbar. The couple do unite in marriage but only after Akbar agrees to the two conditions which the Rajput Princess has put forward. At the same time he has to win her heart as well as to look after the interest of his public.Jodhaa Akbar which stars Hrithik Roshan Aishwarya Rai Bachchan Khulbhushan Kharbanda Suhasini Mulay Digvijay Purchit and Punam S. Sinha is a romantic biographical and historical movie which is set in a era of revolt conspiracies and war. It also deals with intercaste marriage which at the time was not heard off due to the fact that when the Mughals invaded India the Rajput Princesses and Queens became Sati when their husbands the Kings were killed in battle so as not to be captured and or forced to live with the Invaders.Hrithik Roshan son of the director and producer Rakesh Roshan and nephew of the music director Rajesh Roshan was offered this role as the director Ashutosh Gowariker who had seen him in Koi Mil Gaya. believed that he was capable of doing justice to this part and also because of his physique. His natural choice for the lead of Jodhaa Bai was Aishwarya Rai Bachchan not only just because of her beauty but talent as well. He has proved to be correct with the cast  brilliant as they have done justice to their respective parts.This is a well written story by Haider Ali and co written directed and produced by Ashutosh Gowariker which has gone into great details with research and choosing sites for filming. The cinematography by Kiran Deohams is excellent and some cases breath taking. The music by A.R. Rehman is pleasant and suits the genre movie and the songs though a few are good as well and especially the wedding night song. The costumes and jewellery which I am sure that a lot of the members of the audience will be looking out for designed by the famous Neeta Lulla is elegant. The stunts and the fight sequences which are well timed and though they look dangerous at times are worthwhile watching. In one scene where Akbar is seen fighting an elephant actor Hrithik Roshan did get injured but continued with the filming. His injuries were related to those of when he was filming for Krissh. But really pushes the fight and stunt sequences is the special effects by Pankaj Khandpur which are worth to watch.Conclusion This movie has all the ingredients to become a classic epic movie in the future even though it is three and a half hours in duration. It is worth it.For those interested in a bit of gossip. Hrithik Roshan who has been offered to work in some Hollywood movies may not have to go over to in at least one of them. The reason being is that actress Penelope Cruz may be working with him in a yet untitled Bollywood movie which is said to be directed by his father Rakesh Roshan. Could it be that this is just the beginning of a merger between Hollywood and Bollywood? I wonder! Elsewhere Aishwarya Rai Bachchan is soon to be working in a movie with the Mahatama Ben Kingsley with whom she has worked with before in an English version of Taj Mahal. It seems like that she can't keep away from the family.".

She emotes superbly with them and it only enhances her performance. This will go down as one of her career best performances. Also the Hrithik and Aishwarya chemistry is as flawless as ever. They sizzle every scene they are in together.My advice to the audience is to not miss Jodhaa Akbar because doing so would be a huge mistake. It is a masterpiece and a definite must see.

	schema:headline " Jodhaa Akbar  Paro Grows Up But She's Still A Little Girl Oh and Thank Goodness for Subtitles";
	schema:reviewBody "Ashutosh Gowariker's Jodhaa Akbar is the most ambitious film to emerge from Bollywood's stables in quite a while. Based on the historical alliance between India's greatest Mughal emperor and a Rajput Hindu princess Gowariker models his film on the Shakespearean mould of palace intrigue with its collection of warring power brokers plotting princes distant queen mothers bitchy but loyal eunuchs and concubines galore. It's also something of a gamble Gowariker has never treaded the historical epic in his earlier features especially one about India's first attempt at religious pluralism. The results are mixed but laudable largely because the script adheres to the golden rule about bringing historical episodes to film know the history but print the legend.Romeo and Juliet Hamlet and Pocahontas were all real people whose life stories have been told and retold in popular Hollywood films each retelling adding and embellishing elements of the story which have helped the stories attain the status of pseudoreligious myth. India certainly has a rich history of quasihistorical legends Anarkali HeerRanjha Umrao Jaan Devdas and now JodhaaAkbar.Let there be no doubt this is not a documentary nor do the filmmakers make any overt attempt at a documentary characterization of Akbar. History tells us that he was a unique and even megalomaniacal emperor he had many wives and untold numbers of concubines in a harem which depending on which account you believe included a few male lovers invented his own religion in which he was divine and held court with atheists Jews and Jesuits a practice which would become decidedly less common with future emperors.Hrithik Roshan puts up what is probably his best performance as Akbar though he is hindered by the sheer volume of activity making up the plot an absent queen mother sinister foster mother devious brothers and above all a reluctant wife all demand his attention. Roshan is at his best when Akbar is wooing a banished Jodhaa and when he ventures off into his kingdom in many ways Akbar remains a symbol of tolerance and benign authoritarianism throughoutdespite the fact that he is the one who sets much of the narrative's action into play surprisingly few scenes give us insight into his inner workings the opposite is true for Jodhaa.In the last decade since Aishwariya Rai was introduced to moviegoing audiences she has grown tremendously as an actress. Jodhaa Akbar is not her best work but it offers ample evidence of her growth along the spectrum of Parotype roles she has enacted since Bhansalli's Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam  Nandini of HDDCS Paro of Devdas the eponymous Umrao Jaan and now Jodhaa are essentially different interpretations of the same feminine archetype a Lady Beloved of the Legends who having been robbed of all agency because of her gender comes to embody beauty suffering fidelity and of course love.Nandini was a flighty romantic Umrao Jaan a forlorn romantic and Paro a languishing fool who settled for survival when love literally slashed her away. Jodhaa is decidedly not romantic being that she is an emblem of her family's honor. She is given away as a peace offering to an emperor who demands alliance and submission only to find that he wants to become her ally in love.Rai plays Jodhaa as a torn victim but she is not without her own inner steel she sets her own conditions for marriage challenges palace customs and steps on more than few royal toes along the way notably those of the unforgiving Maham Anga. She's not as wishywashy as Paro or as flirty as Nandini but she is undoubtedly cut from the same cloth. And speaking of cutting she's first rate in the fiveminute sword fight between Jodhaa and Akbar a scene which goes from swordplay to foreplay.Rai is slated to play Anarkali opposite Ben Kingsley's Shah Jahan in an upcoming film and has yet another role as the pining courtesan in Bhansalli's next Bajirao Mastani. Normally I would accuse her of selftypecasting but it seems that filmmakers themselves are unwilling or unable to see her differently. Jag Mundhara did with Provoked extracting an emotionally naked performance from her which is without question her finest work to date. Will others be as daring to cast her in similar light? Probably not.The film works best when the narrative focuses on the interaction between its two leads who are more similar than they perhaps ought to be both are icons of physical beauty sexuality and glamour but thankfully this has been tampered down by Gowariker's interpretation of the characters. True Akbar probably didn't have Roshan's sinewy physique and Jodhaa whose existence continues to be challenged in certain historical readings probably couldn't write in Arabic and likely never set foot in a kitchen. But such considerations are immaterial when you're telling a love story.The other striking thing about the film is that for nonnative Hindi and Urdu speakers the dialogue is virtually incomprehensible without the subtitles. The old fashioned Urdu recitations are especially difficult to ascertain though sometimes the subtitles only further your confusion. One line in In Lamhon Ke Daman Mein which is literally translated as Beauty is imbibed in cherished blandishments. What??? Gowariker makes a valiant attempt at a film that is war epic love story and costume drama all in one but never does Jodhaa Akbar approach the charm or finesse of Lagaan. The main flaw with the film is that it is overly ambitious Akbar may have been a polymath but there's no way a single film could encompass all of his endeavors. Gowariker's script strays into too many quarters looking for the historical Akbar and ends up offering what is an unfortunately shallow characterization. Jodhaa conversely has less to occupy her and is more clearly defined.And so in the end it turns out that Akbar the Great is in celluloid terms at least Akbar the Pretty Good.".

Probably not.The film works best when the narrative focuses on the interaction between its two leads who are more similar than they perhaps ought to be both are icons of physical beauty sexuality and glamour but thankfully this has been tampered down by Gowariker's interpretation of the characters. True Akbar probably didn't have Roshan's sinewy physique and Jodhaa whose existence continues to be challenged in certain historical readings probably couldn't write in Arabic and likely never set foot in a kitchen. But such considerations are immaterial when you're telling a love story.The other striking thing about the film is that for nonnative Hindi and Urdu speakers the dialogue is virtually incomprehensible without the subtitles. The old fashioned Urdu recitations are especially difficult to ascertain though sometimes the subtitles only further your confusion. One line in In Lamhon Ke Daman Mein which is literally translated as Beauty is imbibed in cherished blandishments. What??? Gowariker makes a valiant attempt at a film that is war epic love story and costume drama all in one but never does Jodhaa Akbar approach the charm or finesse of Lagaan. The main flaw with the film is that it is overly ambitious Akbar may have been a polymath but there's no way a single film could encompass all of his endeavors. Gowariker's script strays into too many quarters looking for the historical Akbar and ends up offering what is an unfortunately shallow characterization. Jodhaa conversely has less to occupy her and is more clearly defined.And so in the end it turns out that Akbar the Great is in celluloid terms at least Akbar the Pretty Good.";

	schema:reviewBody "Period films when well made are a visual treat. Right from the likes of MughalEAzam till the recent Jodhaa Akbar these flicks have the power to transport one back in time to relive those ages. What might disconcert many viewers of this genre is the excessive directorial license used by some movie makers to blur lines between fact and fiction. Nevertheless I would still say that Jodha Akbar is a great effort and a well made film! Based on the popular folklore the story is about young Mughal Emperor Jalaluddin Mohammed Hrithik getting wedded to the princess of Amer Jodha Aishwarya a match arranged for political gain. But little do both know that this marriage would spark off a fiery romance in the backdrop of young Jalal metamorphosing into an all powerful Emperor Akbar thwarting pressures from familyreligious heads  administrative issues.As such the story neither has a beginning nor an end that any average moviegoer would look for. In fact there is a little bit of everything. You can find romance action including both human and animal duels large scale wars songs great looking lead pair and most importantly the opulence and glorification of Akbars reign. But it wouldnt qualify as a documentary either since the concept of Jodha in Akbars life is in itself fictitious.The highlight however is one man who stands out the most in the movie Hrithik Roshan who has once again proved his star prowess. His talent and hard work is visible in every frame that he is in be it romancing Jodha or on the battlefield. You would really believe him to be ShahenshahEHindustan Emperor of India. His shirtless scene with the sword and the sparring contest between the lead pair are extremely praiseworthy.The HrithikAsh chemistry seen in Dhoom 2 has not just been continued here but has taken to a different level altogether. Aishwarya made a great choice to play a proud and defiant princess. The chemistry and the directorial genius can be seen in scenes where Akbar acknowledges his ignorance to read and write his confusion when offered arati the sparring and scenes when the couple have their private moments.With a three and a half hour runtime and lots of subplots Jodha Akbar at times seems dragged. A tighter script chopping off at least half hour from the film could have helped. The songs JashnEBahaara AzeemOShaan Shahenshah and the sufi Khwaja mere Khwaja stand out. If not a blockbuster the movie will definitely go down in history as a well made movie. Recommended for a very patient audience only!".

The part with the sword fighting and the irony of what how she lost to Akbar was funny. The line where he reminds her he is her husband going along with the sword fight. Many eye contact gestures between the two that were so touching and at times comical.I really loved the Sufis and their singing in the movie. It was a nice blend of action and romance. I like the fact they kept it in good taste and did not dwell on bloody battles or steamy love scenes between the Princess and the Emperor when they finally admitted their love for each other. It got the point across very romantically but tastefully and you don't see that much anymore in most movies. Kudos to those who made this great great movie. It is well worth anyone's time to watch.

	schema:reviewBody "The movie is made on the scale of a classic but it falls short of the mark because it needs crisper editing. On the whole it surely leaves a mark! No doubt.I am not a historian so I cannot mention how accurately history was depicted in the movie but the feel of the movie  ah the feel!  is surely something that takes you to that Era. The clothes the sets the jewellery! Let me get rid of the flaws first Ashutosh Gowariker is not an action director so the battle scenes and even the action sequences lack panache  when they could have been executed brilliantly  especially since Hrithik Roshan can do action fabulously well. The first battle scenes are reminiscent of The Lord of the Rings down to the swinging of the swords in linear movement much like the Elves did when the Orcs attack. The march of the elephants is much like the Mumakil that come out to crunch the riders of Rohan in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields.Some of the lesser character actors have terrible dialogue delivery. And in most cases the dialogues themselves get weighed down by verbosity  and surprisingly the characters who speak Hindi sound more uncomfortable with it then the ones who have to deal with Urdu diction.Sonu Sood who plays Sujamal Jodhaa's cousin enacts his part with restraint and he kept reminding me of a young Amitabh Bachchan. Suhasini Mulay as Jodhaa's mother Padmavati is apt for the role in fact her stature was wasted in Lagaan and Ashutosh finally casts her perfectly. Kulbhushan Kharbanda as Jodhaa's father Raja Bharmal does what he did in Lagaan. This felt like an offshoot of the same character he played there.Nikitin Dheer who plays Mirza Shariffuddin Hussain has done a good job for a newcomer and he suits the role of a solid warrior who thinks Akbar unfit to rule. Mrs. Punam S. Sinha who plays Akbar's mother surprisingly carries off the role with poise  despite a strong accent in her voice that interferes with the use of the Urdu dialect. But Ila Arun performing the role of Maham Anga is someone to watch out for. Her intensity vibrates from the screen as she plays power games with the new woman in Akbar's life. The jealousy she exudes is almost tangible and the pathos of the character's end is touching indeed  she truly deserves a reputable mention.Aishwarya RaiBachchan is  well Aishwarya RaiBachchan. She fits the role because she is usually stiff and aloof. If anyone was to play a queen she would be it  so her role was wellcast. She has worn brown contact lenses for the role which shows that Indian filmmakers are now thinking of certain details that need to be thought about.Though I am a fan of Hrithik Roshan I felt that the role of Jalaluddin Mohammad Akbar did not suit him to a tee  like say for instance a Krish or an Aryan Singh. I cannot pinpoint the reason for this maybe it was the bad moustache sitting above his lips or maybe because I never pictured Jalaluddin Mohammad Akbar to have such a beautiful body. Maybe. But I did say 'did not suit him to a tee'  which leaves me room to add further that he tried his best and that shows in his acting. Also the director's vision was to show the Mughal Emperor as a sensitive soul and that is what Hrithik evocatively brings about either in the vulnerability he portrays while apologising to Maham Anga or the passion tinged with restraint he exhibits when dealing with his distant wife.The cinematography by Kiran Deohans is fabulous. The scope of most shots is allencompassing  but somehow the feel of an epic lags behind. The feeling that one gets is something that closes inward rather than something that opens outward. And in some scenes the lighting could have vastly been improved upon. Neeta Lulla's costumes are fabulous too  and the jewellery provided by Tanishq is aweinspiring. They combined bring about the look and feel of the movie more than what actually should be created by the story the actors and the director.What touched me most within the entire movie was the picturisation of the song Khwaja Mere Khwaja. It was completely surreal  the melody and rhythm in this Sufi song mixed with the pristine costumes and depiction of the scene completely enraptured me. Much like the character of Akbar I felt like standing up and joining the singers in this moment of rhapsody! Truly a delight! Apart from this I cannot say for certain I liked this part of the movie or that part. They are parts which have been put into a whole and made coherent somehow but yet I will go back to see this movie one more time. I feel it is a movie that needs to be viewed more than once in order to grasp the different nuances that are spread throughout. It ebbs and flows with its own life and at places the creators of the movie themselves lost control over it and that is noticeable. But one cannot blame them for that for that is the wont of any creative process. Although perfection comes when restraint is used over unnecessary unravelling and digression.In a way I am glad that the director hasn't used much restraint within the movie because it would kill this feeling of 'je ne sais quoi' that flows through my enjoyment of this movie.".

The movie grabs the viewers attention throughout so that should be a good enough reason to go and watch it. Coming to the performances Hrithik as Akbar has done a wonderful job. He looks the part and his portrayal of a commanding but considerate and tolerant Moughal Emperor looks natural. It is a very controlled performance from his part. Aishwarya looks gorgeous in the movie and she truly does suit the character of a Rajput Princess. As far as her acting goes she is just about average. The onscreen chemistry between the lead pair is sizzling. It is one of the highlights of the movie. Both of them look great together.The supporting actors are good especially Sonu Sood as Jodhaa's cousin Sujamal and Ila Arun as Akbar's wicked foster mother. The songs are few and not much can be said about them apart from the fact that they are well picturised. The costumes and jewelery are quite spectacular. The cinematography is good too.

	schema:reviewBody "I'm extremely disappointed with Ashutosh Gowariker because Lagaan is one of my most favourite films. Jodhaa Akbar was beyond slow dull and boring that I felt like that I could complete a world tour and the film would still be left uncompleted. The story is not interesting and wasn't told well because they took 30 minutes to show a scene that could've been made in 10 minutes. So it is difficult to follow the story. I mean you can't follow a turtle for 4 solid hours! Other than that the film is not even visually impressive like Om Shanti Om  Saawariya. The costumes are not even good although it is supposed to be a big costume drama. Personally I don't mind how long a film is as long if it's watch able e.g. Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna was 3.5 hours and I seen the whole movie in one go and I really liked it. I would not recommend it to anyone but I would advice doctors to use the film for the cure of insomnia since it's so boring.Asoka was also historical like Jodhaa Akbar but that was good because it had a fast moving story and gets to the point. Overall I think that Jodhaa Akbar is specifically made for old people and youngsters should avoid it. Hrithik Roshan's impressive acting and moustache couldn't save the film.".

Personally I don't mind how long a film is as long if it's watch able e.g. Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna was 3.5 hours and I seen the whole movie in one go and I really liked it. I would not recommend it to anyone but I would advice doctors to use the film for the cure of insomnia since it's so boring.Asoka was also historical like Jodhaa Akbar but that was good because it had a fast moving story and gets to the point. Overall I think that Jodhaa Akbar is specifically made for old people and youngsters should avoid it. Hrithik Roshan's impressive acting and moustache couldn't save the film.";

	schema:reviewBody "The director and writer Ashutosh Gowarikar could have done a much much better job of making this movie more interesting had he 1 included the character of Emperor Akbar's Prime Minister Birbal 2 stayed away from the same old boring 'singing and dancing' Bollywood pattern and 3 limited the run time of the movie to at the most 2.5 hours. The movie is at a ridiculously boring length of 3 hours and 28 minutes. And that is sans the last credits for which I did not even stay back as I had to rush to the pharmacy as fast as I could before my head exploded with headache I got by going to this movie. I usually make it a point to stay back until all the credits are over.The first hint of the treacherous movie ahead came when Emperor Akbar joined the Sufi Quawwals to dance at the end of the first song. I am still wondering after 24 hours of watching this movie if this song by people of Sufi sect was to supposed to reflect on Akbar's spiritual inclinations or if it was part of a comedy. With choreography of this song and Emperor Akbar joining the dancers it looked nothing but comic.The romance scenes between Jodhaa and Akbar didn't seem to be that romantic. Definitely they were stretched like a rubber band. The limitations put forth on Ashutosh Gowarikar by Aisharya herself and by the rest of the Bachchan family must have played a role here. Hollywood director actors and actresses do a much better job in this department. One would think that the limitations put on both Jodhaa and Akbar by being part of the Mughal royalty may have something to do with it. But it didn't seem so later as they were shot singing and dancing to this century's tunes. At some point I almost anticipated Hritik Roshan to act like Rajesh Khanna or Dev Anand. I think Ashotosh Gowarikar and all of us would have been in a much better position if Gowarikar had used the old and proved Bollywood trick of using two flowers or two birds or one flower and one bee while shooting these scenes.There were at least 34 places in the movie where the script andor the situation suddenly became very weak. For example when the character of 'Maham Anga' uses a Hindi word 'Naataa' for relation rather than using an Urdu word 'Rishta' or when an ordinary maid servant completes a sentence accusing 'Maham Anga' of exploiting Jodhaa's letter to her brother. Since 'Maham Anga' was held in very high esteem by Emperor Akbar it would have suited if the maid servant would just leave her sentence halfway being afraid of 'Maham Anga'.I have watched other period movies made by nonIndian directors. They never seemed to be so boring even though they didn't have lavish sets and lavish costumes. And you know what some of them like 'Gandhi' have won Oscar awards for Best Film Best Actor etc. Now some people may start arguing saying that 'we should not attach much importance to Oscar awards...' etc. But the same people were tremendously happy when 'Lagaan' was nominated for Oscar awards and the same people were heartbroken when 'Lagaan' didn't win.That apart I won't be surprised if 'Jodhaa Akbar' becomes India's official entry for 2009 Oscar Awards. Afterall there is someone from the Bachchan clan in this movie.On an average this movie is just another piece of Bollywood trash.".

Even after when I came to know that Ashutosh Gowarikar is directing this movie one who gave us amazing experience in Lagaan and Swades I was still skeptical to watch it.But as a movie critic when I got an invitation to watch first day first show with a guest my mother convinced me to go and take her too. The movie was just what I expected twisted history glorifying the Mughals who looted raped destroyed Mandir temples mass converted and openly carried out pogroms. The movie was long boring and repetitive. For the whole 3.5 hrs I could not figure out where is the story heading and what is the director trying to convey. I can't believe it is from Mr. Gowarikar who gave us Lagaan and brewed the love story between BhuvanGauriElizabeth so beautifully even when the plot was about getting rid of the lagaan tax.But in Jodhaa Akbar I was cringing in my seat thinking when the movie will end and what the end would be as the story was not developing any climax. It was so twisted sometimes Sujamal is with Akbar sometimes he is not sometimes Maham Anga is nice sometimes she is not hey Ram oh God so confusing. The love story if there was any between Jodhaa and Akbar was like making a mountain out of mole. The war scenes were average. There were few good comic one liners from the eunuch. Only the acting of Sonu Sood Rajesh Vivek and Ila Arun stood out. The director was unnecessarily bent about showing Hritik Roshan's muscles and Aishwarya Rai's pretty curvature. And yeah do take a Urdu to Hindi dictionary because most of the dialogs were just going over most of the audiences head as everyone was asking each other to decode what the actors just said. At least they could have put some Hindi subtitles for the complex Urdu words they were throwing here and there.Overall underaverage one time watch movie. Be ready to spare 3.5 hrs as it is a very very long movie. Even after the movie finishes it is hard to decide if the movie is about Akbar's war with Rajput clan or a so called love story between Jodhaa and Akbar. I am tired and bored I need some refreshments.".

The movie is technically dazzling with its costumes period jewelry war sequences and eyecandy capture of formidable Rajastan forts it leaps way forward from current Bollywood cinema. But there it ends and the huge letdown is the story that's inaccurate and clichd with delivery straight out of masala movie concoctions. Hira was Akbar's third wife and was converted to Islam on their marriage as was the custom though she kept her idol of Krishna in royal harem. The only notable feature of this marriage was their son Salim who was to become Jahangir Akbar successor. The movie shows Akbar as monogamous who allows Kunwar to stay with her tradition at her request in full public declaration bravado.  Akbar was a multitalented prolific ruleras you can read from Wiki. He slept only three hours a day and worked tirelessly to bring together an empire and keep it working. I don't think he would have had time to play soap opera with his personal life including being drawn to celluloid feud between his regent mother Maham Anga and Hira.  That over too familiar inlaw petty fights are actually Hollywoodcorrect formula that the producers might be hoping would work with cinema going takenforgranted Indians. Maham Agna schemed against Akbar's guardianthe Shia Bairam Khan and wanted her son to involve in realpolitikshe's far too complex and important than a onedimensional villain as in the movie. Depiction of such reality would have brought freshness and tension to the proceedings. Actually contempt for audience's sensibilities is so much that 16centuray royal intrigues are translated into lines that are straight ripoff from TV serials.Thankfully Akbar doesn't run around palace gardens to A. R. Rahman's beats holding his pious defiant supple strong and what not Aishwarya Raisque queen. Instead when he gets an arrow lodged in his chest after an assassination attempt Hira goes singing to Lord Krishna's idol all night with tears streaming of course and the day breaks through the window behind the idol to explain the halo effect I guess and tell you what Akbar wakes up from the dead. In another instance of cinematic genius Akbar goes to bazaar in disguise and hears about Jazya tax levied on nonMuslims and gets shock of his life how can this happen? You cannot have a more puritan moment than that. Oh I got that thank you for your history lesson!Will they ever learn? How can they waste such a mammoth effort on a lame recycledtodeath screenplay? The best movies are those who challenge your senses and preconceptions. I don't think the producers and director were fools. Since investment for production is so huge they didn't want to take risks and thought that playing it by regular cards might get them returns. They missed a chance to make it big and make it memorable. I guess such movies don't happen often.".

I don't think he would have had time to play soap opera with his personal life including being drawn to celluloid feud between his regent mother Maham Anga and Hira.  That over too familiar inlaw petty fights are actually Hollywoodcorrect formula that the producers might be hoping would work with cinema going takenforgranted Indians. Maham Agna schemed against Akbar's guardianthe Shia Bairam Khan and wanted her son to involve in realpolitikshe's far too complex and important than a onedimensional villain as in the movie. Depiction of such reality would have brought freshness and tension to the proceedings. Actually contempt for audience's sensibilities is so much that 16centuray royal intrigues are translated into lines that are straight ripoff from TV serials.Thankfully Akbar doesn't run around palace gardens to A. R. Rahman's beats holding his pious defiant supple strong and what not Aishwarya Raisque queen. Instead when he gets an arrow lodged in his chest after an assassination attempt Hira goes singing to Lord Krishna's idol all night with tears streaming of course and the day breaks through the window behind the idol to explain the halo effect I guess and tell you what Akbar wakes up from the dead. In another instance of cinematic genius Akbar goes to bazaar in disguise and hears about Jazya tax levied on nonMuslims and gets shock of his life how can this happen? You cannot have a more puritan moment than that. Oh I got that thank you for your history lesson!Will they ever learn? How can they waste such a mammoth effort on a lame recycledtodeath screenplay? The best movies are those who challenge your senses and preconceptions. I don't think the producers and director were fools. Since investment for production is so huge they didn't want to take risks and thought that playing it by regular cards might get them returns. They missed a chance to make it big and make it memorable. I guess such movies don't happen often.";

And in short Jodhaa Akbar was nothing short of beautiful. It was more than worth the risk we took to watch it.Starting with the signature Gowariker style with Mr. Bachchan narrating to the map of India in the time of the Mughals the movie was unlike any Bollywood movie I've ever seen before.Admitted we still have a long way to go when it comes to making war scenes which will look anything nearly like a Kingdon of Heaven or Lord of the Rings but still it was an attempt and quite its worth. The battlefield looks wow! The story a pleasant surprise. The acting grand. Aishwarya Rai gives us a glimpse of her acting skills. Her voice sweet melody. Here I must bow to one Hrithik Roshan who gives the performance of a lifetime. He looks royal sounds grand and acts the part with flawlessness to glory. The only amount of helplessness we ever hear from him is when he asks his beloved to forgive him and return home with him. The expressions show how much he has matured as an actor. It is truly a role that is made FOR him. He shines just like the room that did the same while sunset. Watch out for it.The music. Not merely the songs. Khwaja mere khwaja turned out to be surprisingly lovely with two pairs of twins behind the one lead singer making it look sweet if not anything else. Azeem o Shaan Shahenshah looked like a song on which the director worked tirelessly to get done. It was perfect.The way Akbar's administrative observance was shown. In a time when the common people had never seen the Emperor he mixes with them as a mere peasant to crack open the flaws in his system.At three and a half hours the movie never gets boring and that in itself says a lot for a Bollywood flick.Jodhaa Akbar is visually stunning. The battlescenes the Shahenshah's anger expressed to greatness the last onetoone fight between Akbar and his brotherinlaw the mirror in the room of jewels reflected the light of the setting sun Khwaja.. The movie has countless sequences which makes one weak at heart.Jodhaa Akbar is epic storytelling. One of the best ever made.".

The reason the 7 is lost is because he used history to his convenience and imagination. If you want to bring out a classic why not just do that ? Pick a story that doesn't tell the kids that this was what Akbar was like. Why not SheelaRizwan or something that doesn't tell the kids stupid false stories about their country's history. It is a known fact that Akbar was a war monger and plunderer. His relatively liberal religious tolerance compared to his predecessors and ancestors does not make him the greatest ruler of India. It was nowhere mentioned about his warrior abilities. He is known for his administrative and political skill. Yet we are made to believe that he was a great warrior. He had 30 some wives in his harem and they are not mentioned anywhere in the film. Jodhaalmost all historians agree thats not her real name was not his first wife nor his last. We don't even have an account that says she was his favorite. Akbar didn't mention her name in his autobiography AkbarNama. So now a movie with an attractive starcast with great music is being thrust down our throats with history lessons embedded. Bollywood's director's may not be the smartest of the lot but these showmen do a disservice to history and reality by painting everything rainbow when India's past is filled with loot and murder by crusaders and native Moguls. It is sad that everyone is happy with false history and lies in the nation that was founded by a man who spent his life finding the power of truth.".

Also you'll notice inconsistencies with the usage of language jumping back and forth from Hindi to Urdu. Also there is definitely a bias when it comes to the religious aspect of the film It shows that the Mughal empire was very negative about the marriage of Jodha which is believable but the Hindu Rajputs are extremely happy about the whole situation which seemed very unrealistic. This movie was also very anticlimatic. Every miscommunication every evil deed every misunderstanding was addressed and cleared up right away making it seem like all the conflict was very forced in the story and really unnecessary. I'm surprised this movie has such a high rating. I will however praise the cinematography which I think Ashu focused on more hoping he would create and epic film but sadly failed.

It is Turkish music of course and I was fascinated by Turkish music ever since I bought my first record long time ago. The movie features different singers instrumentalists and bands. Spoken comments from the musicians nicely illustrate the music being played and the social context in modern Turkey. For my perspective the most interesting comments were from Orhan Gencebay. Furthermore the movies shows urban scenery mainly from Istanbul which is very pleasant to watch.Crossing the Bridge is listed as a documentary and it includes music from minorities e.g. Kurds and Roma. Other important topics are omitted such as Turkish jazz music or music of the Armenians and Greeks.This movie is strongly recommended for lovers of the music and culture of Turkey the Balkans the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East. It may also be worthwhile for those with a keen interest in the global effects of musical styles such as Rock and Roll or Hip Hop.".

	schema:reviewBody "Akin's prizewinning 2004 movie HeadOnGegen die Wand depicted the appealingly chaotic world of a selfdestructive but dynamic TurkishGerman rocker named Cahit Birol nel. This documentary is an offshoot of HeadOn and explores the range of music one might find in Istanbul today if one were as energetic and curious as German avantrock musician Alexander Hacke of the group Einstuerzende Neubauten who arranged the sound track and performed some of the music for HeadOn and had the assistance of a film crew and Turkish speakers provided by director Akin. You get everything from rap to the most traditional Turkish classical song with rock Kurdish music and Turkish pop in between. It's as chaotic and openended a world as Cahit's one where East is East and West is West but the twainsomehowdo meet.Like Istanbul itself which sits on the edge between Europe and Asia and brings the two worlds together while remaining sui generis this is a mlange that includes Turkish pop Turkish traditional songs Kurdish laments Roma jazz musicians and group of street buskers Siyasiyabend lively and offbeat shots of Istanbul street life and some talk on camera about synthesis and some personal and musical history by singers and musicians. Working out of the Grand Hotel de Londres in Istanbul's Beyoglu quarter where Cahit stayed at the end of HeadOn while looking for his beloved Hacke roams around the city with crew and equipment interviewing people and recording their music.He begins with some loud rock by the neopsychedelic band Baba Zula  these are musicians he bonded with while putting together HeadOn's score and he stands in here for the absent bassist  and by Turkish including brave female rappers  thus causing some oldsters to walk out of the theater early on and miss the predominantly tuneful and easytolistento sounds that makes up the bulk of the film. HeadOn's narrative excesses were tempered periodically by musical interludes performed by a traditional Turkish orchestra sitting outdoors on the other side of the Bosphorus. Hacke gives us the opportunity to meet and hear performances by some of the best known living Turkish singers including Mzeyyen Senar a lady in her late eighties whose aging elegant musicians remind one of the way the great Egyptian songstress Umm Kulsoum used to perform. Hacke gets songwritermovie star Orhan Gencebay to do a striking solo on the longnecked oud he's written all his songs on and persuades the now elusive great Sezen Aksu.to do a special performance of one of her most famous songs Memory of Istanbul. This is a coup and so is the lament by a beautiful Kurdish songstress Aynar recorded in a bath whose acoustics are spectacular if only they could have turned down the heat  singer and musician's faces stream with sweat. There is also a young Canadian woman Brenna MacCrimmon fluent in Turkish who sings Turkish traditional folksongs with expression and fervor. The sound mix is of high quality throughout. One would like to see a sequel many great exemplars of Turkish popular and classical music have necessarily been left out.Film released summer 2005 and shown at festivals in 2005 and 2006.

Do not expect a compilation of Turkish folklore or anything like that. Alexander Hacke a German musician and member of the cult band Einstrzende Neubauten travels to Istanbul to get to know the music scene. His sparse voice overs of what he experiences are a guiding line through the film. But mainly GermanTurkish director Faith Akin lets various artists from Istanbul do the talking  and of course their music. You meet a variety of personalities big stars and street musicians young and old people playing many different musical styles. But this movie does not only introduce you to the sound of Istanbul. It also draws a compelling picture of Istanbul today and how Turkey has forged ahead in the last decade. The film characterises its protagonists with subtle humour but never without respect. All of them share a passion for music and the belief in its power. Akin again shows his talent to portray diversity lightheartedly when he brings you close to completely different musical scenes. After his award winning feature film Gegen die Wand Head on Faith Akin proves with Crossing the Bridge that he is equally able to touch entertain and guide his audience in a documentary. If you have never been in Istanbul you will want to go there after having seen the film.".

It is nice to see you all at a small cinema in Wood Green.";

Even now a month later I remember the footage of Aynur singing in an acoustic auditorium and I try to remember the music as it echoed in the cinema.

But Faith akin being an Turkish oriented guy who probably knows about that country more than an ordinary European falls into the trap of orientalism that other western artists usually fall. But come on man you are Turkish blooded and your movie could be deeper and could describe what's beyond beyogluold town It's a missed opportunity for Akinfor that reason. Performances by Muzeyyen Senar and Orhan Gencebay are peek of the movie and Ceza a very talented and bad ass Turkish rapper makes some trash talk about American gangsta rappers which I totally agree. I will recommend this movie to my American friends.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Crossing the Bridge The Sound of Istanbul' is one of the best music documentaries that I have seen lately and is more than a film about music. It is also a musical love declaration about a fabulous city one of the greatest city in Europe and the world one of the most important cities for Europe history and for Islam the city that may bridge in the future Europe and the Middle East or may signify once again as is already happened in history the precipice between two worlds.Then there is the music. The interesting approach that the film takes with regard to music is that it starts from modern music and we hear a lot of good rock and rap in the first third of the film. An then like a backwards move in time the soundtrack takes us to the roots to Turkish traditional music to commercial romances and to the exotic instruments that are basic elements in the landscape of Turkish music. In such a complex and conflict ridden country as Turkey is the film does not avoid some of the political aspects like censorship introduced by the military rule in the 80s or the relevance of the songs of the minorities especially the Kurdish one. One of the best musical moments is actually provided by a Kurdish singer with a fantastic voice singing in a cathedralshaped hamam Turkish bath.One gets to love the city and its music by the end of the viewing and hearing of this film. I have never been to Istanbul but after having seen this film I am sure that I want to visit this place soon.".

Boyd has to funnel money to the Russians using a prisoner switch as an excuse but it all goes awry when during the exchange he realizes the prisoner the Russians are sending over is someone he just saw at the airport. He aborts the switch immediately. He and his Russian Baryshnikov are directed to a safe house but when it blows up Hackman realizes the CIA wants both of them dead. So they go on the run with 2 million.This film had a light breezy atmosphere to it and the two stars play it sort of like an I Spy episode. It's not an out and out comedy but it's pleasant and implausible enough. Someone thought that the big reveal about the young the woman helping the two in France made the thing truly ridiculous  I don't know why. Baryshnikov at the time of the filming was 43 and the young woman Geraldine Danon was 23. What's the problem? Great locations in Berlin and France good acting and some exciting scenes. Fun if you're not expecting The Spy Who Came in from the Cold.".

I figured what the heck and rented it anyway.  I was quite surprised to find myself really enjoying this film even though you sometimes have to really work at suspending your disbelief. I'm still trying to figure out how exactly Baryshnikov could have been successful as a mole with his accent.This film has two things really working for it though  the dialogue and the stars.  The dialogue is wonderful.  Throughout the movie there are great one line bits that leave you chuckling.  Mind you most of those lines wouldn't have worked if Hackman and Baryshnikov hadn't had such great chemistry.  You really don't watch this film for the plot but for the interaction between these two.  It certainly wasn't a pairing I expected but it worked.With all that said my one complaint about the movie has nothing to do with whether or not it was a believable plot but where it left off.  I wanted more resolution.  My husband agrees.  We got to the end of the film and he looked at me and said That's it?  It was just getting good.  It leaves too many things up in the air.All in all I would say if you are expecting a spy movie don't bother. If on the other hand you want a fun little buddy movie rent it and enjoy.".

Baryshnikov is also quite good in one of the few if only film roles where he isn't a dancer. The plot isn't a total dud by any means and has a lot of twists and turns even if you don't want to examine any of this too closely along with a least one doublecross. The action is entertaining the contrast between Hackman and Baryshnikof and the typical James Bond secret agent is clearly defined. These guys are basically over the hill has beens just trying to survive. Sort of like an end of the Cold War Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.Underrated and often overlooked this has all kinds of things going for it. Spies old guard verses new humor chases escapes double and triple crosses globe trekking and so much more. The name of Gene Hackman certainly may be enough to sell you and he's in topnotch form in this film but add to that the surprise addition of Mikhail Baryshnikov turning in a marvelously credible acting job and you have the beginnings of a thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Cold War type spy films may seem pass to some but this film totally captures the excitement and intrigue of the genre. The script is a bit silly but it is a tradition for USSR vs. USA spy films. I think it is a classic oldschool cold war movie with two brilliant main heroes.Overall rating 8 out of 10.".

They seem to grow at random angles out of his gums but he so rarely smiles that it's hard to get a good look at them. Kurtwood Smith does his Kurtwood Smith number capably. And the musical score is disarming a plucked balalaika backed by a base fiddle.The story is something about a doublecross by the CIA the company and some remnant of the KGB during an attempt to deliver Michael Baryshnikov to his homeland. Baryshnikov and Hackman find themselves pursued through Germany and France by both sides. They trade wisecracks but the wisecracks aren't funny. Well there was one I enjoyed. The duo approach a cheaplooking car they are considering stealing and Baryshnikov pronounces it Eastern. Is it alarmed? asks Hackman. Only when you frighten it.There isn't much action either for those looking for temerarious propulsion and what there is of it is sometimes confusing.The chief problem I think is with the disjointed script. It doesn't seem to know for certain where it's going or why. Hackman was in a similar movie  Target  which was more successful given the limits of the genre.

The all star cast of supporting actors came as a pleasant surprise. What I liked bout the film is that the story seemed real the characters were inspired by the real world rather than the world of moviewriting. Hackman's character ekes out a living doing petty Industrial Espionage and not very successfully from the look of it. The bad guys aren't twodimensional they're doing what they believe is best. Neither side stays one step ahead they simply wing it. The European setting gives the film a little extra character eg. seeing one of those Trabants with their horrible 2stroke engine in action. The film is rough around the edges however with some shots given significance for no reason and some important plot elements that if you blink you'll miss. If I had watched this in the cinema I would have been confused by the whole thing.I think David Mamet could take a few lessons from this film his characters in Heist seem to possess a telepathic level of anticipation. Company Business is nowhere near as polished as Meyer's Star Trek films but it is enjoyable if you're willing to rewind when it stops making sense.".

It would be too easy to just get the two cars to pull up in a supermarket car park the guys get out and swap places the cars drive away. So an elaborate process is gone through using the Berlin underground. The trains stop the guys walk towards each other along the track but then... Sam calls the swap off and bullets fly.Now Sam and his spy Pyotr Baryshnikov are hunted by both the CIA and the KGB. All across Europe they go and then Paris where Pyotr's girl real cute too conveniently works at a bank and it is dead easy to transfer the money to a Swiss bank account even though the notes are numbered.We know what will happen but the way the movie progresses is fun to watch except for the shootouts. Do the CIA and KGB never teach their guys to shoot accurately? It seems not. But if they did a lot of movies would be a lot shorter. Maybe scope for a new movie Gunfight at the top of the Eiffel Tower?A goodenough story good characters good acting not much in the way of special scenes some great lines but spoiled by the shooting so I subtract a rating or two to an 8.".

Sam calls the swap off and bullets fly.Now Sam and his spy Pyotr Baryshnikov are hunted by both the CIA and the KGB. All across Europe they go and then Paris where Pyotr's girl real cute too conveniently works at a bank and it is dead easy to transfer the money to a Swiss bank account even though the notes are numbered.We know what will happen but the way the movie progresses is fun to watch except for the shootouts. Do the CIA and KGB never teach their guys to shoot accurately? It seems not. But if they did a lot of movies would be a lot shorter. Maybe scope for a new movie Gunfight at the top of the Eiffel Tower?A goodenough story good characters good acting not much in the way of special scenes some great lines but spoiled by the shooting so I subtract a rating or two to an 8.";

	schema:reviewBody "One of the delightful sides of Company Business is that it shows some of the seedy side of the espionage game especially when things are being run as games within games and by people with whom you not only could never identify but you are unsure as to what they really are representing. The theme is simple People are born on one side or another and become part of the turmoil long after the ideals have been laid to rest. This was certainly done better in various Jon Le Carre' books but the result is the same. This was a movie about how time was bypassing the Cold War. I was surprised to read that Mikhail Baryshnikov hated this movie and would do no publicity for it. While he didn't do such a great acting job in it he did remind one of the characters he was playing jailed nervous and unsure of where he was going. Hackman's acting was much lower key than normal his ability to deliver short bursts of power and that machine gun forced laughter notwithstanding. He gave you the image of an overthehill agent who couldn't resist another shot at the action. I especially liked the idea of them escaping from both sides back to the universal idealistic dream. My only great criticism is how silly it is to portray being shot in such an insouciant manner. The fact that a country might not have extradition also isn't really an issue for the CIA KGB or even the Columbian drug czar. The scenery is beautiful in Berlin and I howled at them being in one of the clubs which made Berlin famous. Paris was also beautiful and the Eiffel Tower scenes were majestic especially the Eiffel Tower elevators. Geraldine Danon was hauntingly beautiful especially when she shows up at the caf to meet Hackman. I am disappointed that she did not show up in any other Hollywood movies.".

Supported with passionate music and photography this film is a kind of Iraqi elegy with some truly haunting and heart wrenching scenes. Rather unique as a war film or rather quite the antiwar film this is not an action movie nor is this a romanticisation of war or patriotism. When there is war action it's shot in unconventional ways and Fahdel the director gets his message across without any long speeches. Many of the effects are conveyed indirectly but so effectively that some scenes compete in intensity to a film like Apocalypse Now. Highly recommended. 1010".

The performance by the actress playing the older sister is pretty good and there is some nice dramatic tension between her and Robert Logan's character.  The card game between Logan and the horse traders was pretty amusing.Bad stuff  I thought the film ended rather abruptly.  While there is a resolution of sorts it would have been interesting if the film could have gone on for maybe another 15 minutes.  In addition Robert Logan seems far too pleasant to play the selfcentered gambler character.Overall not a great film but one good enough to keep your attention and the attention of the kids.".

It's also my peeve in the Genre but one must be capable of a more emotional response to fully appreciate what is being said in a film like this. Cue the imagination. What the movie gives up in believability regarding the animal scenes it more than makes up for in filming locations. I was surprised to see the Peyto lake scenes as this is a very rugged and remote area of Alberta to shoot. Some real hiking may have been necessary for these shots but they are spectacular. A few good stunts like a man and cougar fall from a cliff add to the appeal. Overall this is feel good 70's movie material.".

I would say this film is more interesting than the prior film. It features a friendly runaway crooked gamblerLogan as Coop being chased by an angry party. He encounters a couple of kidsperhaps 11y.o. Holly Smith and her perhaps 7y.o. brother Jason said to be on their way to Oregon to claim a 400acre farm. Everyone seems woefully prepared to survive such a trek! Virtually nothing is said about food through the film. They shot one deer but had to give it up due to interference by a bear. This was the first of 3 lifethreatening encounters with a grizzly. They are also attacked by a partially grown cougar and by a pack of howling wolves. Of course they suffer minimal injuries in ferociouslooking encounters. Don't know how they staged these? In between there are various nonthreatening encounters with wildlife especially young animals. Their dog sometimes plays with them including a herd of bison. At one point they encounter a friendly Indian tribe and spend a night with them. They maneuver a canoe through some rapids before ditching it. Now they need horses again. They happen upon a group of trappers with some extra horses. They try to buy 2 but lack enough money for one. Thus Coop suggests a card game. With trickery he keeps winning until they have enough money for the 2 horses. Unfortunately the mountain men are sore losers and are ready to dispatch Coop when Holly comes to the rescue.......In all a great family picture especially for kids who can identify with the kids in the film and be wowed by the animal encounters. The majestic mountain scenery and verdant foreground make for a relaxing environment between animal emergencies.".

They are also attacked by a partially grown cougar and by a pack of howling wolves. Of course they suffer minimal injuries in ferociouslooking encounters. Don't know how they staged these? In between there are various nonthreatening encounters with wildlife especially young animals. Their dog sometimes plays with them including a herd of bison. At one point they encounter a friendly Indian tribe and spend a night with them. They maneuver a canoe through some rapids before ditching it. Now they need horses again. They happen upon a group of trappers with some extra horses. They try to buy 2 but lack enough money for one. Thus Coop suggests a card game. With trickery he keeps winning until they have enough money for the 2 horses. Unfortunately the mountain men are sore losers and are ready to dispatch Coop when Holly comes to the rescue.......In all a great family picture especially for kids who can identify with the kids in the film and be wowed by the animal encounters. The majestic mountain scenery and verdant foreground make for a relaxing environment between animal emergencies.";

	schema:reviewBody "Created by photographer James Bidgood PINK NARCISSUS is a lush exotic and remarkably beautiful erotic fantasia that explores the face and body of model Bobby Kendal as he slips in and out of erotic fantasiesfantasies which range from bullfights with himself as a matador and the bull as a leatherclad motorcyclist to being held captive for the pleasures of an Arabian ruler. Both the the apartment in which the character lives and the daydreams into which he slips are remarkably designed recalling such artists as Parrish and Klimt and the film emphasizes the tactile nature of everything it displays one of the most memorable moments in the film for example are photographs of beads in motion that eventually segue into an erotic dance. The camera also explores Kendall's exceptional face and body in the same tactile manner and whatever his actual virtues as a legitimate performer might be he is perfectly at ease with the camera's voyeuristic joy and the resulting images are powerful memorable and virtually define the term erotic art.It might be supposed that this film appeals primarily to a gay audience but over the years I have shown it to a great number of friendsmale female gay straightand their response has always been one of fascination the film exerts a hypnotic allure that few can resist. At the same time however I must note several things about the film that some may dislike.If you expect a purely skin show type film or simple pornography PINK NARCISSUS is likely to frustrate for it works its magic more via tantalization than blatant nudity at the same time however there is enough graphic behavior in the film to give it an X rating even today. It is also a purely visual film there is no dialogue of any kind and it is very much an experimental underground 1970s film as such it actually does require a certain degree of intellectual effort and interpretation. These aspects of the film may leave some viewers cold but those able to enter into its sensual world will find it a powerful bit of erotica. Recommended.Gary F. Taylor aka GFT Amazon Reviewer".

And he's unclothed for most of it a Caravaggio boy.The film is a good example of ingenuity on the director's part  it's a smallscale melodrama not unlike those of Guy Maddin if Maddin was more lushly sensual and less manically comic. It's not a porno but it is extreme gayness and the mere essence of that is enough for some people to get it up. But regardless it is very erotic a number of scenes stripping the boy's undies off sucking his own fingers slowly humping the ground in nature push the right buttons. There are some inventive scenes like the boy getting a beejay from a leather man swimming in a milky liquid and then after that a urinalfetish scene. I haven't seen Un chant d'amour so I don't know the degree to which this is influenced by Genet but it does have its parallels to the Genetinspired third of Poison. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "Mindblowing colour and rampant symbolism are splattered across the screen in James Bidgood's oneofakind Pink Narcissus. At a casual glance this milestone film can appear as little more than a series of beautiful erotic and obscure imagery. But it is much more than that. Model Bobby Kendall portrays a male prostitute trapped in a surreal hell an environment that is artificial manufactured and unnatural. The city outside of his door is even more devoid of nature or life with it's zombielike creatures stumbling around looking to either buy or sell sexual favors. The pretty hustler retreats into a surreal candycolored fantasy world where his customers become beautiful storybook heroes Arabian Sheiks matadors Roman Emperors and their slaves. The hustler being the ultimate narcissist uses his own idea of beauty when imagining what these characters look like himself. Kendall is featured in most parts as slave  master prince  peasant etc. His imaginings are realized onscreen in blazing fantastic color accompanied by an eclectic and haunting array of music. As each fantasy set piece plays out a familiar image returns repeatedly scenes in nature trees and flowers and living creatures drenched in sunlight soaked in rain an environment that is the polar opposite of the concrete  neon hellhole in which this beautiful man seems to be imprisoned. His fantasies of nature which are the most beautiful and truly erotic sections of the film suggest a desire to return to something natural and real in other words a return to innocence. A scene where Kendall's character is literally penetrating the Earth by lying on the ground and sticking his penis into the soil is symbolism that is not that hard to understand. And the dark apocalyptic climax where the same ground swallows him into it's underground depths in an inferno of driving rain and thunder and he finds himself.. back in his pink and gold apartment as a new customer lets himself inside to be serviced. Does the apartment represent some kind of hell? The great thing about this film is that it raises questions like that and forces it's audience to think and to wonder. When a film can accomplish that it transcends entertainment and becomes art. Pink Narcissus is a film that needs repeated viewings to get the full picture. After being dazzled by it's jawdropping imagery the first time around one can settle into the world and the mindset of this man whose own physical beauty has alienated him from reality. With a bit of an imagination you will not need LSD to relate to him...".

Oversaturated color pink blue and yellow gels and every object gilded and bejeweled within an inch of its life. Add chiffon satin and skintight chinos and almost any still from this movie could be misconstrued as Pierre et Gilles.As much as those French artists have borrowed from PN the film itself reaches for a lot of gay iconography of the time. The street scenes seemed to be trying to animate Paul Cadmus canvases e.g. with a pinch of Tom of Finland thrown in.Another reviewer mentions that while the film is dated 1971 images from it appeared as early as 1964. I was a teenager in 1964 and the first thing that struck me was how early 60s Bobby Kendall the lead looked vis a vis hairstyle and clothes. And the props such as they are would now be called Hollywood Regency and that wouldn't be far wrong. From our current perspective I would say it's a good look back at what openly gay men looked likeor aspired toimmediately before Stonewall and before the hippie aesthetic took over the 60s.Correct the film is freeform nonlinear yet seems to be trying to get some point across. I'm not exactly sure what that point is. It's pretty much fillintheblank it's so generalized. Something about gayness and selfrevelation but perhaps it was too early in the century for the filmmaker to be able to give us something with more emotional impact.This isn't especially a good film but it is an ambitious one. And it's early in gay culture. For that reason I think it deserves to be seen but keep your expectations low. If it had been trimmed by at least half of its 110 minutes it probably would be more highly respected today as a work of art. But then a 45 minute film wouldn't have made it into the art houses of the 70s....".

He envisions himself as a Turkish prince a Roman slave a wood nymph a matador and even a kept boy in some far off sheiks harem. Everything is so incredulously heavy on the design front bejewelled and stylised to excess.

	schema:reviewBody "Donnie Yen is a long time favorite of mine although this is mainly due to his martial arts skills and screen presence rather than his acting skills. In Ip Man or Ye Wen as they were shouting in the seats next to mine he delivers a truly solid performance on the acting side carrying the burden of a nation on his shoulders with gravitas at least that's what he conveyed to the audience at the cinema. They were actually applauding at times. Then again moviegoers might be more absorbed over here on a regular basis. I digress.I'm not going to delve deeper into plot details. The basic stuff is already outlined above and I also feel the historical accuracy of certain events depicted can be debated. That's a bit of a moot point though since most people will watch this for the action scenes. Nobody will be disappointed. Donnie kicks twelve kinds of ass in this movie and it is all accompanied by some of the meanest sound design I've ever heard. Every one of his rapid punches can be felt as he pummels the poor bastards in his way with the Ip Manstyle of martial arts imdb won't let me spell out the name for some reason. The final bout is epicbut for me it was one scene about halfway through that got my heart beating faster. It involves Donnie ten Japanese karate practitioners and some of the most furious fighting I've ever seen on screen. You can really sense the anger of his character in this scene. Great stuff.The film moves forward at a brisk pace and contains a surprisingly large amount of fight scenes. It totally lacks the vintage overthetopaesthetics of Donnie Yen's films of the 80's and 90's but for some people that's a good thing. I personally think this is his finest performance to date. Highly recommended for fans of martial arts cinema!".

Every Wing Chun instructor today tries to make a lineage connection to Yip Man to legitimize their teaching so he is a very important figure in Kung Fu. Donnie Yen portrays the master with intense reserve and is possibly the best acting in his career. It surprised me for sure.The story line of this film is invented as historical accounts show Yip Man to have been a police officer in the time frame this film covers not staying at home and only practicing kung fu as depicted here. Also the film claims that he refused to teach anybody but that is also not true. He left for Hong Kong a few years after WW2 not in the middle of it as this film presents. The plot with the Japanese army seems invented although they did ask him to teach the troops which he refused. However the film muddies up the historical record that is not to say it isn't a great film. Sammo Hung's choreography is exceptional and a throwback to his great kung fu films of the early 1980's. The martial arts are done with great respect to traditional styles although some wire work is used to assist the actors with the difficult acrobatic moves. No flying across the room in this film. Although the ending is a little abrupt this is one kung fu film that can be recommended to people who don't like these films. Highly recommended.".

Wing Chun is best depicted without the flamboyant ballet of acrobatics often seen in other wushu films.The movie doesn't dwell on historical accuracy but rather use that settings to set the mood deliver the message and simply tells you the life journey of a Grandmaster in an fun and entertaining way.I remember that Richard Attenborough said regarding Gandhi that there was no way a directormovie maker could encompass and depict a person's life journey in only a 2 or 3hour movie.

Taking on the common martial artsKung Fu Movie theme of what can one martial artist do against a turbulent worldtime? one of the movie's promotional taglines the story hook is not whether Ip Man will win but rather when he will be forced to fight and what would happen when he does. And the notable level of acting scripting production etc. highlighting not only Ip Man but also the plight of his family friends and townsmen really ramps up the drama and heart for audiences who might not care for the genre. One evidence for this is how Ip Man garnered 12 nominations for the 2009 HK Film Awards in both the actingdirecting and technical categories though it really stands out as a killer KungFu Film and consequently won for Best Action Director and Best Film.In short Ip Man is quite a good mainstream movie but a great martial artsKung Fu not action as Donnie Yen points out during interviews movie. And some telling numbers explain whyThere are around 12 fights or so depending on how you count them evenly spaced throughout the film with Donnie Yen in almost half of them with 3 or so weapon fights not counting guns and 5 or so group fights anything with more than 2 people which is why this is a martial arts movie and not an action movie no explosions chases shootouts etc.. The shortest fight takes about 10 seconds and his longest runs around 2 minutes which gels with Donnie Yen's belief that real people fight to win and don't pose talk fight run and... pose talk fight run and.... Together with the miscellaneous violence guns etc. the audience is virtually given an adrenaline shot every 5 minutes or so to give audiences something to laugh cry or even cheer about.Of course it also inspired in me a newfound respect for Wing Chun Ip Man's school of martial arts as well as action director Sammo Hung's tight choreography and camerawork in ChinaHK action directors control the camera as well as direct the actors. The closetomid range shots make it easier to catch the stunt doubles... but just like everything else in the movie blink and you'll miss it!For much like Wing Chun everything in this movie get to the point quickly so that at over 100 minutes the movie feels much too short.... But thank you Wilson Yip the director for respecting the audience and not belaboring the message for a movie that is basically a war nationalist melodrama it manages to unfold as elegantly as Ip Man's character  Donnie Yen's acting.But for those who care about the downside this movie is only loosely based on Ip Man's life in that the earlier parts is a dramatization of various accounts the middle section is highly exaggerated 1to1 vs manyto1 sparring and the end is completely fictional read lead to an endfight. And as a World War II sidestory about a simple people in a small place Foshan China there are only a few lines of text and transitional scenes depicting the Japanese invasionoccupation of Foshan the director didn't have the budget to show how Foshan lost 34 of its population though it manages to be quite effective especially for those already familiar with the history. But those craving more creativity complexity or completeness in this movie will be disappointed especially by the rather haphazard way the movie wraps up Ip Man's life at the end when it wasn't certain whetherhow a sequel would be made.Whatever the quibble Ip Man heralds a breakthough in realism for grounded martial arts Wushu movies the way Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon heralded a breakthrough in surrealism for floating martial artsWuxia movies. It is clearly made for fans of Wing Chun and Kung Fu Movies and it makes no apologies for that thank goodness for no foreign investors though it means that this movie is unlikely to get foreign distribution.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Ip Man";
	schema:reviewBody "I shall now proclaim unabashedly that I absolutely love this movie! It's been some time since we last saw a biopic on one of the Chinese's martial arts folk heroes with Jet Li's Fearless being the last memorable one to hit the big screen. While Li lays claim to three of such roles in the iconic Wong Fei Hung in the Tsui Hark movies Fong Sai Yuk and Huo Yuan Jia in Fearless after which he felt he had to hang up his martial arts roles because he thought that he had communicated all that he wanted about martial arts through these films. And thank goodness for Donnie Yen still being around to pick up from where the genre left off and presenting a memorable role which he truly owned with Ip Man being the first cinematic rendition of the Wing Chun martial arts grandmaster.In this biopic Ip Man one of the earliest Wing Chun martial arts exponents credited to have propagated its popularity gets portrayed as the best of the best in 1930s Fo Shan China where the bustling city has its own Martial Arts Street where countless of martial arts schools have set up shop to fuel the craze of kung fu training. With each new school the master will pay their respects to Ip Man and to challenge him to a duel. Ip Man an aristocrat who spends most of his quality time developing and perfecting his brand of martial arts will take them on behind closed doors so as not to damage his opponents' reputation nor embarrass them in public. His humility is his virtue and his style is never violent or aggressive which often gets assumed and mistaken for being effeminate since Wing Chun after all was founded by a woman.The bulk of the story gets set in the outbreak of the SinoJapanese war and it's not all fight and no story. Witth this historical setting at times it does seem that there is an air of familiarity with the type of stories told with how the Japanese Imperial Army had made life really miserable for the Chinese and how the Chinese being fragmented in spirit fail to unite during dire straits. More often than note martial arts become a unifying force and this aspect of the narrative might seem to be a walk in the usual territory. But with its array of charismatic supporting cast with the likes of Simon Yam as Ip Man's best friend and industrialist Quan and Lam Ka Tung as a cop turned translator there are little nicely put sub plots which seek to expand the air of respect that Ip Man commands amongst his community. The story by Edmond Wong did not demonize all the villains often adding a dash of empathy and sympathy to the likes of the Japanese General Miura Hiroyuki Ikeuchi a highly skilled exponent from the North called Zhao Fan Siu Wong as well as Lam's translator character who is deemed as a traitor for being in the service of the Japanese. Ip Man the family man also gets put under the spotlight where his passion could sometimes leave him neglecting his wife and kid and through the course of the story this focus often leaves one quite exasperated for his family's safety as he puts his countrymen above self and family when going up against the oppressive Japanese forces.So what's the verdict on the action? Action junkies won't have to wait too long before watching Ip Man in action and to Sammo Hung and Tony Leung Siu Hung's credit they have intricately designed some of the most varied martial arts sequences in the movie such as private fights in his home a factory mle a Japanese dojo battle as seen in the trailer which I know has actually sent some positive vibes amongst moviegoers mouth agape at that incredible scene of Yen continuously beating down a karateka being somewhat of a throwback and reminiscent of Bruce Lee in Fists of Fury and a ringside duel amongst others. And it's not just Ip Man who gets in on the action but specialized martial arts moves designed for the various practitioners as well. It's so difficult to name any particular one as a personal favorite though I must add that you definitely won't feel short changed by the time the inevitable final battle comes rolling along and gets delivered with aplomb.I'm no Wing Chun practitioner but Donnie Yen has this marvelous calm and zen like approach with his Ip Man taking out his opponents quite effectively with the minimal of moves. Like Huo Yuan Jia he doesn't deliver the killing blows to friendly opponents but rather simulates the various hit points which actually calls for some astonishing control of strength and precision. This approach will change of course as the opponents become anything but friendly. And unlike the usual martial arts stance of crouching low here we see him standing tall and striking with such precision and efficiency it's like poetry in motion with some astounding closed quarter combat utilizing plenty of upper limb strength. With Wong Karwai at one point also declaring interest in making a Ip Man movie I thought that this effort will be hard to beat just like how Tsui Hark has crafted some of the more definitive movies in modern times about Wong Fei Hung and Jet Li benefiting from a major career boost I'd say Ip Man just about cements Yen's reputation as a martial arts leading man which I guess the cinematic world these days severely lacks. This has to go down in my books as one of my favorite movies of the year and I'm already setting some money aside to get the best available edition of the DVD when it gets released. Highly recommended so make a beeline for the box office now!".

	onyx:emotionText "I shall now proclaim unabashedly that I absolutely love this movie! It's been some time since we last saw a biopic on one of the Chinese's martial arts folk heroes with Jet Li's Fearless being the last memorable one to hit the big screen. While Li lays claim to three of such roles in the iconic Wong Fei Hung in the Tsui Hark movies Fong Sai Yuk and Huo Yuan Jia in Fearless after which he felt he had to hang up his martial arts roles because he thought that he had communicated all that he wanted about martial arts through these films. And thank goodness for Donnie Yen still being around to pick up from where the genre left off and presenting a memorable role which he truly owned with Ip Man being the first cinematic rendition of the Wing Chun martial arts grandmaster.In this biopic Ip Man one of the earliest Wing Chun martial arts exponents credited to have propagated its popularity gets portrayed as the best of the best in 1930s Fo Shan China where the bustling city has its own Martial Arts Street where countless of martial arts schools have set up shop to fuel the craze of kung fu training. With each new school the master will pay their respects to Ip Man and to challenge him to a duel. Ip Man an aristocrat who spends most of his quality time developing and perfecting his brand of martial arts will take them on behind closed doors so as not to damage his opponents' reputation nor embarrass them in public. His humility is his virtue and his style is never violent or aggressive which often gets assumed and mistaken for being effeminate since Wing Chun after all was founded by a woman.The bulk of the story gets set in the outbreak of the SinoJapanese war and it's not all fight and no story. Witth this historical setting at times it does seem that there is an air of familiarity with the type of stories told with how the Japanese Imperial Army had made life really miserable for the Chinese and how the Chinese being fragmented in spirit fail to unite during dire straits.

Telling the story of Yip Man the man believed to have popularized the martial art of Wing Chun before and mostly during the SinoJapanese war.Yen caught my attention after seeing him in SPL. Then in Flashpoint I was stunned by his moves and thought he was the next Jet Li. Well after this I think he may very well be the next Bruce Lee. I mean it! Not only injecting humanity and superb characterization Yen also demonstrates his brutality when it comes to fighting. And boy it does not get more brutal than this! Seriously Yen's fists move like machine gun bullets. And he makes sure that his opponents are down for the count... at their expense and our enjoyment. Definitely Yen at his bruising best.Other actors worth mentioning Simon Yam and Hiroyuki Ikeuchi as Ip Man's business partnerfriend and the Japanese General respectively. The former portrays Ip Man's comrade with heart while the latter performs with steely resolve and honor. This is a film that is not just made with action but a good story as well.The fight scenes here are arguably Yen's best so far and the best in over a decade. People are getting beaten martial arts duels are taking place and blood is spilled. This is not an action movie it's a kung fu movie. And it shows. Legendary kung fu star Sammo Hung brilliantly choreographs the fight scenes to perfection and it looks like he's not going to slow down any time soon. The direction by Wilson Yip is slick and gripping as always and he also gives the film a nice sepia tone to give feeling to the film.In short great. This is a mustsee for kung fu film fans to get their adrenal glands pumping. It's one of the best kung fu films of the decade. See it if you have the chance.Overall 710".

	schema:reviewBody "Directed by Wilson Yip Killzone Flashpoint This movie is a portrayal of the famous Wing Chun master Yip Man credited as being the guy that taught Bruce Lee kung fu. The movie starts of a bit slow and seems a bit awkward imo. The dialogue didn't really work on me and I didn't quite feel the comedy or drama the dialogue was supposed to invoke. However troublemakers enter the city and the fighting shall begin. When that part began the movie immediately started to grow on me. The fighting is very well choreographed and the stunts are really amazing. I am very interested in martial arts and fighting and thus many movies loses me when I have to see a 300 pound muscular guy supposedly gets knocked out for 10 minutes by 1 jab from e.g. Jackie Chan or choked out by Angelina Jolie. However in this movie the fight scenes are so amazing that I easily accept that a knee to the body can send a guy a flying across the room. The fighting is of course unrealistic though not extremely so but they somehow make it seem legit in this movie and you actually start believing for the duration of the movie that Ip Man is capable of this stuff. As for the cast Donnie Yen is the one that stands out. He is a really great choice for Ip Man with a very calm and intelligent charisma and he shows in this movie that he is capable of being a diverse actor. The other actors did a fine job as well most notably his wife Lynn Hung and General Miura Hiroyuki Ikeuchi considering their acting experience. The cinematography soundtrack costumes and art direction are all well done. They got some fairly experienced people for that but not anyone really famous except for the movie buffs perhaps most notably Kenji Kawai and Kenneth Mak. My main critique lies in the fact that this movie markets itself as a historical portrait while this is clearly not so. Apart from the fight scenes that has probably never gone down in reality we also have the portrayal of the Japanese. While they definitely did invade China and committed some atrocities there I somehow doubt they had karate tournaments with Japanese vs Chinese. The movie also claims that the city population was reduced from 300k to 72k which I somehow doubt but I am unable to find any source that either disprove or confirms that statement. But since the movie is from China I guess a nonbiased portrayal of the Japanese invasion is too much to ask. But the thing that bugged me the most was the final part of the movie which show a fight scene with following events that I am 100 positive has never happened but the movie actually try to claim that it did obviously I can't explain the scene to you without spoiling. So all in all a great movie. The plot meets the required amount of relevancy that is needed to keep you interested but what really stands out is the fight scenes which is what lift this movie to great heights and what I assume has secured it a place on the IMDb top 250 list. I greatly enjoyed the movie but the fact that the movie tries to sell itself as being a historic portrayal really bugs me the wrong way and drags it down a point.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ip Man 18931972 is the expert in the Wushu fighting style of Wing Chun and is the master of the famous Bruce Lee. As there has never been any previous film record of Ip Man this film produced by Raymond Wong and directed by Wilson Yip will be the very first.The movie opens and dates back to 1935 Foshan with the city bustling with activities and various schools of martial arts are seen busy with the practice of their craft. In the people's mind however there would be only one martial artist who is the best. He however would have no interest in opening a school to teach his art. He is Ip Man played by Hong Kong action star Donnie Yen.Our introduction to Ip Man began on the day when Master Liu Chen ZhiHui visits Ip Man at his residence when the latter is having dinner with his wife and son. Being the typical martial arts enthusiast that Master Liu is he declined to leave when advised by Ip Man to come back at another time choosing instead to stay and wait until Ip Man have finished his dinner. He is eager to test his skills against Master Ip Man. The mood here is not of hostility but of a light hearted and humorous fashion. Ip Man even invited Master Liu to sit and have dinner with his family when he spots him restlessly waiting by the living room. We see here the humble and modest character of the protagonist.When the sparring finally got underway it ended as swiftly as Ip Man's strokes suggest. Because in three strokes and a set of quick fists he had Master Liu at his peril well defeated yet without injury as this was all but a friendly exchange in the spirit of martial arts. The essence of Ip Man's fighting style Wing Chun is characterized by its tall narrow stance with effectiveness demonstrated through speed and power. It reminds of the time when Bruce Lee had to slow his punches down during filming as they were just too fast for the cameras back then to capture.In the world of martial arts with all its attractiveness it also brings with it the competitive nature of those who practice them. With competitiveness taken the wrong way things can go awfully wrong when all one wants to achieve is to have the other beaten so as to prove who the superior fighter is. A thug in Kam Shanchau Fan SuiWong later arrives and challenges the various schools defeating their masters ruthlessly until he came face to face with Ip Man. Kam lost to Ip Man with a lesson he ought to have learn only that he did not and left Foshan with only disgrace in his mind. The people celebrate as they hail Ip Man the savior who brought glory to Foshan by sending the thug away.The fight ends but the story have only just began and with it a change of mood from lightness to heavy because war has broken. The Japanese have seized Foshan.What follows will be Ip Man's struggles and challenges as he has to make ends meet for his family in the dreadful time of adversity. It is here we see the true character of Ip Man who has captured the hearts of the people of Foshan and their respect. This is most notable among his friends in Chow Chingchuen Simon Yam his son Chow Kongyiu Calvin Cheng and Crazy Lam Xing Yu.To mistake this film as one of just good versus evil is easy because in a movie that has a hero there must be a villain. There are a few characters here befitting of the role. We have the Japanese general Miura Hiroyuki Ikeuchi. We have the aforementioned thug Kam Shanchau. We also have police officer turned interpreter Li Chiu Lam Katung who appears to be a traitor. The film here however should not to be seen as a fight against evil but rather of the depiction of humanistic values that Ip Man himself would possess.There are many meaningful messages encrypted in the various plots and subplots in this wonderful film that really is about virtues more than anything else. As producer Raymond Wong would suggest on why the production team had chosen to make this film it is that of really making a kung fu movie that is authentic and real moving away from past attempts at glorifying and stylizing violence on screen. The intention is to make a film that would reflect the spirit of Chinese kung fu and what better than to portray it through the virtuous character of Master Ip Man.I would have like to compare this film to Fearless aka Huo Yuan Jia 2006 starring Jet Li which strings from a similar root but at the very core the approach is different. While Fearless is written in a more dramatic nature with a more compelling story and edited with a creative dimension Ip Man is honest and direct because that is who our protagonist is.What stood out for me in Ip Man is when he ponders in introspection about what use his training and expertise in Wing Chun all his years would come to. It would appear that there is destiny waiting to be fulfilled. And he would also influence those around him with what he has and even lead those who have been wrong to do right despite the pressure of circumstances because to the very basis it is the right thing to do in humanity.History means nothing if its lessons are not learned.The film also stars the stunning Xiong Dai Lin as Cheung Wingsing Ip Man's wife and I must also not forget to mention that the acclaimed Sammo Hung directs the action.".

The people celebrate as they hail Ip Man the savior who brought glory to Foshan by sending the thug away.The fight ends but the story have only just began and with it a change of mood from lightness to heavy because war has broken. The Japanese have seized Foshan.What follows will be Ip Man's struggles and challenges as he has to make ends meet for his family in the dreadful time of adversity. It is here we see the true character of Ip Man who has captured the hearts of the people of Foshan and their respect. This is most notable among his friends in Chow Chingchuen Simon Yam his son Chow Kongyiu Calvin Cheng and Crazy Lam Xing Yu.To mistake this film as one of just good versus evil is easy because in a movie that has a hero there must be a villain. There are a few characters here befitting of the role. We have the Japanese general Miura Hiroyuki Ikeuchi. We have the aforementioned thug Kam Shanchau. We also have police officer turned interpreter Li Chiu Lam Katung who appears to be a traitor. The film here however should not to be seen as a fight against evil but rather of the depiction of humanistic values that Ip Man himself would possess.There are many meaningful messages encrypted in the various plots and subplots in this wonderful film that really is about virtues more than anything else. As producer Raymond Wong would suggest on why the production team had chosen to make this film it is that of really making a kung fu movie that is authentic and real moving away from past attempts at glorifying and stylizing violence on screen. The intention is to make a film that would reflect the spirit of Chinese kung fu and what better than to portray it through the virtuous character of Master Ip Man.I would have like to compare this film to Fearless aka Huo Yuan Jia 2006 starring Jet Li which strings from a similar root but at the very core the approach is different. While Fearless is written in a more dramatic nature with a more compelling story and edited with a creative dimension Ip Man is honest and direct because that is who our protagonist is.What stood out for me in Ip Man is when he ponders in introspection about what use his training and expertise in Wing Chun all his years would come to. It would appear that there is destiny waiting to be fulfilled. And he would also influence those around him with what he has and even lead those who have been wrong to do right despite the pressure of circumstances because to the very basis it is the right thing to do in humanity.History means nothing if its lessons are not learned.The film also stars the stunning Xiong Dai Lin as Cheung Wingsing Ip Man's wife and I must also not forget to mention that the acclaimed Sammo Hung directs the action.";

	schema:headline " A rousing historical uprising story";
	schema:reviewBody "There is a weird notion in the UK that says that teenagers learning history in school would rather learn about how people died due to poverty in some minor British cities in the 1800s than anything outside of Europe for the past 2000 years. I personally find Asian history far more interesting than anything the UK has ever done. Perhaps Dynasty Warriors and Samurai Warriors have somewhat skewed my view on the matter but compared to the utterly dull events of Britain's sparse history Asia just seems far more interesting to me. This film's true story seems somewhat to be proof of this idea.Ip Man sounds like a superhero name but alas he is but a man. Despite this he really may as well have fighting superpowers. He is a master of the martial art Wing Chun and no human in his town of Fo Shan can beat him in a fight. During the subjugation of his town by the Japanese in World War II he struggles to get even a bag of rice. Fighting also occurs.First and foremost the fights in this film are some of the most impressive in terms of filmmaking and straight up martial arts that I have ever seen. Dust is flying about after hits and when fighters get knocked down they seemingly defyphysics and push themselves back onto their feet. Not only are the actors impressive but also the way the fights are shot is incredible. The film uses speed ups and slow downs masterfully slowing down time is an important thing with Donnie Yen because he could likely unleash 1520 punches in a second  which he does many times. It strikes a perfect balance between being too slow to be exciting and too fast making it overwhelming and confusing. On a slightly unrelated note much like the Raid films I would like to disclaim some of the brutal shots in this film. If you don't want to see a guy's leg get utterly snapped you may want to brace yourself during the fight scenes.At the end of the first act of the film there is a violent shift from a pretty light hearted mood to a much darker tone. While the grimmer of the two atmospheres is fantastic and tense throughout the difference is far too stark between the two and moreover the first section very much overstays its welcome. All the fights while excellent in this section seemed purely expositional. The start in no way prepares you for what is coming next. While this may be seen as smart storytelling for maximum audience response you are somewhat left realising that the film instantly went from the people of Fo Shan chanting 'Master Ip' to a man getting shot in the face at point blank range by Japanese soldier. While the misstep of the tone of the first act seems minor after seeing the spectacle of the film's latter sequences it does exist and did certainly detract from the film overall.I mentioned earlier that the darker section of the film was rife with tension and atmosphere and it is what sets the film apart from other films in the martial arts genre. These films are often either entirely comic anything Jackie Chan has done or entirely visceral either of the Raid films. This film on the other hand takes both of the approaches and slams them together. While the seams stitching the two styles together are hugely apparent the film is made better by both being present. The part of the story during the Second World War totally conveys the horror that really occurred in true history. The setting is dank and the comparison between shots of downtown Fo Shan before and after the switch is incredible and the production value of this single street is vastly detailed and has clearly been laboured on for countless hours  which I am certainly impressed by. The use of colour is a huge shift in the film as well making the Japanese soldiers the only characters wearing anything other than shades of grey and I love smart use of colour in films. The second and third acts are incredible visually and conceptually.Ip Man is a meticulously produced film about the eponymous master of martial arts. The fights within the film are incredible from both choreography and cinematography standpoints. The first section is unexpectedly upbeat but the latter half more than makes up for it. It is undoubtedly one of my favourite martial arts films which is a difficult position to get to.".

	schema:headline " An extraordinary martialart film";
	schema:reviewBody "I'll start with the martial art aspect. The Wing Chun style is not the best material for popular action movies. Its characteristic is motion efficiency lighting fast movements and direct strikes an approach that inspired Bruce Lee in the creation of his own style. While deadly effective Wing Chun is not very exciting to watch. Furthermore its kicks are low profile both literally and figuratively not the flying kicks that have become almost mandatory for today's popular kungfu flicks. Ip Man's portrayal of this martial art style is quite authentic granting a certain creative liberty for cinematic effects understandably. Immensely satisfying for someone whose has some experience albeit modest with this style such as this IMDb user this movie may not satisfy those who are used to the usual Jet Li Wu Jing or indeed Donnie Yen stuff.Ip Man however is much more than an action movie. Like Fearless 2006 it is the biopic of a great martial art master. Interestingly and this parallel has just occurred to me as I write its richestorags plot line has some similarity to Cinderella Man 2005. But it has a loftier backdrop  survival with pride compassion and dignity under the atrocities of Japan's occupation of Southern China during WW II.The action scenes can be grouped into three segments which also serve to outline the story. The first group occurs during a time when Master Ip bathing in affluence leads a lowprofile life with his family lovely wife and little boy basically doing nothing other than perfecting the love of his life the Wing Chun style martial art. The fights fuelled by challengers both local and outsiders take place behind closed doors in his plush house so that the invariably beaten challengers are not embarrassed. The second arena is the factory of a lifelong friend Simon Yam when he trains the workers to defend themselves against bullies and later gets involved himself in helping them to beat off harassing goons. By this time he has been reduced to abject poverty house and possession confiscated by the occupying Japanese working as a coal miner. The last group of fights is set at the barracks of a Japanese general who being a martial art fanatic offers sacks of rice to lure coal miners who are exmartialart experts to duels with his people and himself. As expected the climatic final duel is between Master Ip and this general.Unlike in many other goodagainstevil movies Ip Man does not succumb to handing out onedimensional villains. Policemanturnedinterpreter Li Chiu's Lam Ka Tung agonized scream that he is not a traitor but just an interpreter struggling to survive does get a degree of sympathy. A bullying goon's outburst that he does not want to go hungry virtually echoes Scarlet O'Hara. Even the Japanese general is portrayed more as a martial arts fanatic than a bloodthirty villain.In Ip Man is a Donnie Yen that you have never seen before and it is not surprising that many consider this to be Yen's best cinematic performance todate. From the quietly confident gentle man who wants to avoid trouble to the impoverished husbandandfather finding himself suddenly quite useless but rising to the occasion to the fighter enraged by the senseless death of his martial art friends  Yen is right on pitch. In an interview bc Magazine of Hong Kong 85yearold Ip Chun who is Master Ip's little son in the movie asserts that Yen's performance finds the essence of his father. Yen's portrayal of Master Ip is indeed a source of pride to Wing Chun students all over the world.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had a choice of watching The Spirit or Ip Man. It is a tough decision and after a long while I finally makes the choice of watching Ip Man. The director of Dragon Tiger Gate makes his comeback with his usual star Donnie Yen. As expected the martial arts fighting scenes are amazing. This director is amazing he knows how to direct realistic martial arts fighting features in Dragon Tiger Gate. This guy can create I can say some of best martial arts movies.The story It tells about Ip Man's life the soontobe master of the famous Bruce Lee. I can't say much about the plot but the fighting and the music are great. The Japanese soon attacks China which affects Ip Man and his family. Soon he goes for a fight organised by the Japanese which can earn him rice. The Japanese General is impressed by his ability which leads to the final battle of all. It is fast paced with amazing fights in between and humour.Overall If you are a martial arts movie fan this is definitely stunning and not to be missed. If you get entertained by any form of action and want to know the facts of Bruce Lee's master this should also not be missed. Another good martial arts movie.".

The director of Dragon Tiger Gate makes his comeback with his usual star Donnie Yen. As expected the martial arts fighting scenes are amazing. This director is amazing he knows how to direct realistic martial arts fighting features in Dragon Tiger Gate. This guy can create I can say some of best martial arts movies.The story It tells about Ip Man's life the soontobe master of the famous Bruce Lee.

To add insult to injury it ends with a text crawl which tries to claim that the Japanese defeat in 1945 was due to the Chinese because Ip Man inspired them which is as shameless as it is ahistorical.".

This integrity is drawn through the hole movie and leads to a very boring character and a pretty black and white good guysbad guys scheme. Our hero never really has to struggle with himself and most of the time Donnie Yen looks like he doesn't know what to do with himself.

	schema:reviewBody "OK I realize I am out on a limb here. But I think I am onto something. First let me say I have seen 99.9 of all martial arts films released in the west in the last 50 years including entries from Japan Thailand and Korea. Also in my youth I used to go into Chinatown in Montreal and watch direct imports from Hong Kong no subtitles. So credentials on the table and already facing many disapproving glances from other martial arts cinephiles I want to respectfully draw your attention to a scene about 34 the way through where the corrupt local officials decide to make their beef with the Ip Man character personal and go after his family. Let's pause for second. First this is a biopic and as I have said in my other reviews on IMDb usually but not always for a biopic the rules are a bit different and the story is a little more constrained. In fact for this sequels to this excellent film they threw the rule book out the window with attendant consequences all bad but I digress I am not reviewing those films here. Second the casting. Some have complained that Donnie is too old for this kind of role but after spending so many years decades with Jet and Jackie I think he is a breath of fresh air and clearly his skills in the Wing Chun style are authentic. Now to the fight scene. It is short which puts me in double jeopardy because I have not only dared to pick a fight scene I think is a standout but I have picked a scene which is short. In the scene the character Ip Man who TO THIS POINT IN THE FILM has been a model of restraint reacts with true emotion when his family his wife is manhandled. He goes after those doing the attacking and his hands move so fast that for a moment it appears his opponents have been caught in a threshing machine. The reason I dare to compare this to other great scenes such as for example the marvellous early sequential fight scenes in Ong Bak also candidates for the greatest fight scenes of all time is the emotional setup. In these kinds of films you rarely see emotion when the Masters fight. Here Donnie allows his character to show passion as he turns the bad guys to hamburger and for that reason I think this film already iconic should get special mention.".

It tells the story of IP Man Yip Man a Chinese Martial Art Grandmaster who teaches Wing Chum. It is based on the life of Yip Man 18931972 whom taught many students throughout his life several of which became martial arts teachers in their own right. His most famous student was Bruce Lee. This movie has lots of action from martial arts training to big fight scenes interwoven with drama that makes you really feel for IP Man. It has a great storyline supplemented with top notch acting. Donnie Yen does an excellent job in his role as IP Man and in my opinion this is one of his best performances. IP Man 2 is also very good but lacking in story compared to the original. I would rate the original IP Man as being the better out of them. This is truly a must see for any actionmartial art fan.".

	schema:reviewBody "Starring Brian Dennehy an unusual actor for a Peter Greenaway film as Kracklite an architect a career we don't often see explored in cinema Greenaway's 'Belly of an Architect' is somehow bigger and more emotionally ambitious than most of his other works which lack human resonance. In his other films the characters are uniformly British and so Greenaway's coldness and archness toward them is indicative of a general misanthropy. Here it's aimed squarely at Romans whose loose morals and carnivorous practices contrast with the enormity of Kracklite's ego and generosity of spirit. His stomach is being eaten away by some unknown illness or cancer and this serves as a metaphor for his ego being eaten away by the carnivorousness of Roman culture. His wife his identity which is a vicarious one given his devotiondebt to his idol Boule and his work are being repossessed by the conquestful Roman carnivores who aim to destroy him simply for the material gain of taking what is so ostentatiously his. But his devotion to Boule his need to make Boule's work more widely known is not a singular or altruistic act the exhibition he is organizing will make Boule more commercial and accessible but it will also be an addendum to his own career a manifestation of his ego. His diary is written in the form of letters to Boule to whom he is almost praying as his own personal God. And his devotion to this God is not a selfless one since Boule is so inexorably an element of his own identity.Rome and its buildings are given a golden postmodern glow their clarity enhanced by Wim Mertens' musical score which adds its own sunlight to the proceedings. But the sunlight that glows throughout Rome and permeates the aura of the film is an impersonal one an indifferent one as ancient as the ruins of Rome which our Roman characters observe have been more useful and influential as ruins than they were prior. They're better as ruines a character observes. Your imagination compensates for what you don't see like a woman with clothes on. The Romans are depicted here as carnivores and the word carnivore is used multiple times who not only want to devour and repossess but want to strip. Brian Dennehy's performance here is indeed stripped larger than life fiery. He explodes on screen bringing the film into another realm introducing emotional dimensions not often seen in the films of Greenaway and in this the film has a power that inhabits the movie's symmetrical form mostly every shot is symmetrical its architecture and threatens to destroy it. The coldness that is typical of Greenaway that architecturized godlessness is at war with fiery human passion in all its flawed nakedness.Greenaway's movies in their arctic wit and obsession with symmetry are cinema as architecture more so than storytelling so 'The Belly of an Architect' contrary to the claim by many that it's his most mainstream and therefore weakest work is perhaps his most appropriate film and maybe his best".

The play is usually given to us by some sort of fiction passing as real or a charade within another a story within itself so that we may be directed from the confines of the narrow frame into a broader view that includes it.The idea is especially powerful in the context of architecture that we use form to project outwards a set of ideals but having understood ourselves eventually circumscribed by structures that describe us we can then use them to describe the inner landscape.So indeed we stroll around one such interior Rome where earlier decadence or glory or masks thereof greeting us from marble balustrades and rows of pillars reflect inside. A city so ornately decorated and cast in stone as though man would outlast his follies.Into this comes an American architect  the man whose folly is to build things that last  to stage an exhibition for some obscure French architect who died 180 years ago. Italians are not too happy that he hasn't picked one of their own but they oblige to finance nonetheless.There are two broad ideas that Greenaway is careful to lightly caress tease out their potential implications but finally circumnavigate. The film would have been lesser had it settled on either or is perhaps greater for encompassing both.One is the doubling the architect begins to imagine himself as his older counterpart writing letters to him in the form of private confessional then begins imagining himself as emperor Augustus trapped in the same ploy of marital infidelity and murder. He replicates these stories around him. So these people overlap and are mirrored with bellies bellies aching with the toll of creation. At this point you may think it is all going to be another film about the creative person losing himself in the mind merging life with narrative.The other is as always with Greenaway about all this as doubling for the making of the film. It's a filmwithin device make no mistake. So the visionary artist is increasingly frustrated by lackeys ignorant moneymen virulent antagonists scheming to usurp him energy is wasted in duplicitous dinner parties and idle but always more or less venomous chitchat until eventually finds himself embittered and alone in his own set.But it is not merely about the price of genius or a satire of the contemporary civilized arena that it has to bleed into.Look for the scene with his doctor in front of the busts of emperors each bust a face and story one decadent and evil another perhaps famed as wise but all inadvertently gone. A little further down is a bust without name it could be anyone's and whatever story will be inscribed upon it it's again only destined to join this gallery of fiction. It is important to see these follies but more important to see the continuity.So it is this acceptance on the part of the architect the man who builds things not only to last but to be beautiful in time of the turn of the wheel decline through rebirth. It is powerful stuff to see the scene in the police station near the end where he is simply asked name and age whether married or not. He is free to go then. He has been jotted down in the ledgers.The final scenes in the exhibition center echo with this casual dismissal of a life lived a casual but sweet relieving it would seem departure after so much grief with nothing to weigh on the shoulders. He attends the exhibition the work of a lifetime from the balustrade above from the vantage point of not being involved anymore. Everything looks like a small ceremony from there. So this is the nested world that matters not the exhibition but the creative life on the egoredemptive journey through life at large purging itself of itself after the painful struggle to master the world building pantheons finally submitting to be the mastered world transient as it comes into being and goes again.As he goes new life is born down below  and plays again and again it would seem before the colossal marble structures.It is perhaps the ideal Greenaway film the selfreferential tics are all present the framework ornate but instead of chaotic it is all mastered into a pillar that supports unifies vision.

Wim Mertens' musical accompaniment is brilliant and on par with any modern minimalist composition. After years of seeing his TV roles I was completely floored by the depth and authenticity Brian Dennehey brought to the main character. I've watched this film at least a dozen times over the years and enjoy it thoroughly each time. Unlike a previous reviewer I don't see the need to judge this film based on how much it resembles previous or subsequent Greenaway films. Belly of An Architect is not as abstract as some of the other Greenaway films but that shouldn't be viewed as a negative. The film is great and rich in its own right. I highly recommend it.".

	schema:reviewBody "It was a shock for me to discover having watched several of Peter Greenaway's films and having loved many that this for me is easily his best from what I've seen. I will temper that by saying that I saw this in the cinema and the cinema does wonders for many films. I find Greenaway's Baby of Macon for example has too much detail and visual complexity to be particularly accessible via home viewing. Greenaway has indeed been criticised for an overly painterly approach to detail in his films which some deem not fit for a medium with a moving image. His long time collaborator cinematographer Sacha Vierny for example considered Prospero's Books a failure for the overcluttering with visual detail that was cinematically indigestible.The late Sacha Vierny doesn't get talked about nearly enough other than Belly and most of the famous Greenaway films he shot Last Year in Marienbad for Resnais as well as the majority of the famous pre80s Resnais movies The Three Crowns of the Sailor amongst others for Ruiz Bof Anatomie d'un Livreur for Faraldo a marvellous though little seen film Belle de Jour for Bunuel La Femme Publique and others for Zulawski as well as collaborations with Chris Marker Maguerite Duras and Sally Potter. The critical part he played in these great movies is rarely sung. As Vierny was not interested in fame and rarely gave interviews how much direction he took and how much of his own artistry he plyed will forever remain an enigma. As with most of this work The Belly of An Architect is a really great looking film.The story of this film is about an architect played by Brian Dennehy called Stourley Kracklite if you can believe such an indigestible name hinting at gastric stagnancy and duodenal eructations. In consonancy with his name he spends the movie plagued by sluggish prickly guts. Kracklite has always admired an obscure 18th century French architect called tienneLouis Boulle a reallife architect who was famous more for his astonishing designs than for actual won commissions this has often been a hazard for architects I believe. Make good use of the internet or your library and look up his magnificently insane design for Newton's tomb which was never taken up or his sprawling design for the Bibliothque Nationale. Due to his overreaching ambition he therefore ended up making mostly private homes and there's only a handful of his built projects left in existence.So Kracklite has finished with making his own buildings and spent the last ten years of his life planning an exhibition on Boulle to be held in Rome. There are a lot of typical Greenaway features here obsession with food cuckoldry a battle between an older and younger man. Somehow Greenaway managed here to take his usual stuff beyond an academic game to a place where there is mythos and poesy. Greenaway for me is a director with a deep feeling for lifecycle he doesn't present children as small adults or middle aged men as ephebes with jowls and paunches.For me it's a film about lifecycle and meaning and homage to genius. I just adore it.".

	schema:headline " Beautiful and Moving  Not Typical Greenaway's Film";
	schema:reviewBody "Dreamlike beautifully shot by great Sasha Vernie and equally disturbing as all Greenaway's movies are The Belly of an Architect 1987 tells the story of an American architect Stourley Kracklite Brian Dennehy who came to Rome to work on the exhibition dedicated to the French architect of the 18th century EtienneLouis Boullee 1728  1799. Stourley brings with him his much younger wife Louisa with whom is passionately in love. Everything looks good for him  he's got a project of his dreams to work on his wife is with him and his Italian colleagues seem to be supportive and exited about the exhibit as much as he is. Soon though the things begin to change and look rather grim  Stourley's pregnant wife enters the affair with a younger man the work does not move as quickly as it was planned and on the top of all Stourley gets sick and perhaps more seriously than he thinks.When I watch Peter Greenaway's films I know they will be a feast for brain eyes and ears  his films consist of frames so perfectly composed that you want to capture every moment of them and exclaim like Goethe's Faust did Stay a while! You are so lovely!. The music in his films matches the visual beauty perfectly and his outlook at the familiar world is always original and arresting even if it lacks warmth and sentimentality. The Belly of an Architect is all that it is filled with symbolism and references to history Art and anatomy. It is also a social satire on difference between cultures but it is a compelling and moving story of one man's descending to chaos hopelessness despair and eventually death. This is the first Greenaway's movie since The cook The Thief His Wife and Her Lover that made me feel compassion for its protagonist. I believe it is due to the incredible performance by Brian Dennehy  quite unusual name for a Greenaway's film but was he great as the architect of the title. Dennehy creates a character that is not likable as the film begins but heartbreaking and tragic by the end.810".

However the project is not going well his wife has eyes for a younger Italian man and there seems to be a terminal ache in his guts I'm not a big fan of the work of the acclaimed artschool darling Greenaway but this film is brilliant. I think this is because there are three elements which separate it from the normal World Cinema stylings. The first and most important is the brilliant casting of Dennehy as Kracklite. Not only is he physically perfect  a big bear of a man but also a formidable intellect  but the radical departure from his normal US cop movie persona to a European art house film brings out a rich thoughtful performance. Kracklite is a man whose world is crumbling about him reincarnates others in himself is obsessed with his body and writes postcards to a dead man but his passionate defence of the exhibition and of the purity of Boule's work is at the core of the drama. Cult fans should also note the sultry presence of Casini the doomed friend from Dario Argento's Suspiria. Secondly there is terrific music by the Belgian composer Wim Mertens combining extraordinarily beautiful woodwind and piano melodies  the title piece Birds For The Mind is a hauntingly perfect accompaniment to many of the exquisite images in the film. Finally the film is simply crammed full of jawdroppingly gorgeous shots of Rome  the title shot of the twin churches in the Piazza Del Popolo a sumptuous opening banquet outside the Pantheon the oldest building in Rome the sequences at the Monumento Nazionale A Vittorio Emanuele II the typewriter the grey dawn when Kracklite visits Piazza San Pietro a bit at the Fontana Dei Quattro Fiumi in the Piazza Navona many others. It was shot by Sacha Vierny and contains many smart visual cues green figs and photocopier light for envy Flavia's photo montages Newton blowing away after Kracklite's final encounter with gravity the spinning gyroscope as well as more aesthetically pleasing symmetrical shots than perhaps even Stanley Kubrick's work. Vierny was one of France's most gifted cameramen Hiroshima Mon Amour Belle De Jour whose career was given a second wind by his association with Greenaway the two creating many remarkable images together. Even if you don't like arty flicks turn down the sound on this one and just drink in the beauty and scope of the visuals. Movies are pictures. This is Greenaway's best film by a long chalk although his subsequent two  Drowning By Numbers and The Cook The Thief His Wife  Her Lover  are also both worth catching.".

On to the film Shot in Rome it will thrill people with interest on architecture both visually but thematically as well well at least at some points. The musical score is stunning.

All the soundtrack songs together form a thriumph of visual and audio art suggesting my point about the importance of film soundtracks for an effective impact on viewer. This is a sad story but it features some light points where joy and lust for life is celebrated  at least for my eyes and ears.Those who criticise Greenaway for attempting only to shock the viewers have simply lost the point.

	schema:reviewBody "You always know going into a Peter Greenaway film that for better or for worse you are going to get something a bit leftfield. The Belly of an Architect is really no different in this regard. This one tells the tale of an American architect who travels to Rome with his young wife to supervise an exhibition celebrating the 18th century architect EtienneLouis Boulle. Very soon after arrival both he and his wife experience contrasting activity in their bellies for him it is severe abdominal pains while she falls pregnant. To complicate matters they soon begin affairs with other people. The film essentially then details the architects mental deterioration which includes writing postcards to his long deceased doppelganger Boulle.This one has to go down as one of Greenaway's more accessible films. It has an actual story that is underpinned by a good central performance from Brian Dennehy. But its maybe the very fact that it skirts so close to realistic drama that is one of the main problems as Greenaway is usually best when he does precisely the opposite. The story is really quite boring and the acting aside from Dennehy not all that good  Chloe Webb being particularly flat as his wife look out also for Stefania Suspiria Cassini sporting an unfamiliar cropped 80's barnet. The visuals while certainly nicely composed aren't all that memorable. Given that the setting is Rome there are many shots of that cities peerless architecture although that all gets almost a bit travelogue to a certain extent. I think this film therefore is one for Greenaway devotees almost exclusively as in order to get a lot out of it you have to be interested in his ideas. While I have liked several of his films I can't deny that even in the cases of the ones I liked most his films can be somewhat annoying. Dennehy really helps draw us in to events though and makes a good stab at involving us but it's difficult to care too much about these stiff characters populating a narrative that is both distant and very cold emotionally. Boulle himself is a typically absurd Greenaway figure in that very little of his architecture ever came to be built so it's difficult to ever imagine a high profile retrospective of his work ever happening. His rounded domed buildings mimic the belly of the title as does his name. So there are many links and symmetries in the story if you are at all interested in that kind of thing. But while some of the photography was nice and it did have a good score from one of the members of Kraftwerk it was overall a little tedious for me.".

Also the beautiful cinematography by Greenaway's trusty DOP Sacha Vierny makes the film very easy to look at. From the ancient architecture of Rome to a paintinglike bowl of figs it is pristinelooking. Michael Nyman is absent but the music by Wim Mertens is splendid.

	schema:reviewBody "This is possibly the most painful and yet bland lovedrama I've seen. It's also a film about clashes between cultures. Why? you ask.SPOILERSWell in the beginning when we see the happy couple making love on the train everything is so relaxed and comfortable. Then they arrive in Rome Italy. And ever so slowly the Italian sunbeaten culture with a whole different set of values start creeping in.At first both Senior Cracklite and his wife are met with great respect as if they were both filmstars or something. And then they start interacting with Italian people eating late beginning to get sluggish by the everyday heat being hit by the everpresent yadayada of the Italian language it's a beautiful language but still yadayada etc. And then Louisa meets the eversmiling and charming Italian men who takes her by storm. Mr. Cracklite is so immersed in his job that it's hard not to see where this is going.And so it goes the way we all fear. And I could really feel a strange recognition in this.

Why? you ask.SPOILERSWell in the beginning when we see the happy couple making love on the train everything is so relaxed and comfortable. Then they arrive in Rome Italy. And ever so slowly the Italian sunbeaten culture with a whole different set of values start creeping in.At first both Senior Cracklite and his wife are met with great respect as if they were both filmstars or something. And then they start interacting with Italian people eating late beginning to get sluggish by the everyday heat being hit by the everpresent yadayada of the Italian language it's a beautiful language but still yadayada etc. And then Louisa meets the eversmiling and charming Italian men who takes her by storm. Mr. Cracklite is so immersed in his job that it's hard not to see where this is going.And so it goes the way we all fear. And I could really feel a strange recognition in this.

We are fortunately spared Greenaway's trademark setups in which all the protagonists are approximately 12 miles away from the camera lens while rhythmic monotonous classical music accompanies their every distant move.I didn't find the movie particularly stunning visually I have no idea what fans of this movie are talking about when they praise the sets and the photography. You can see shots like this in any National Geographic documentary about Ancient Rome or the city's museums and architecture. Greenaway occasionally sets up scenes in an effective way certainly managing to get the maximum out of the rather thin plot but there is little here that deserves utterances of wow!. Let's not get overexcited here people just because the movie was made by a man who is considered avantgarde and whom it is hence forbidden to criticize too much an unwritten rule in the hypothetical Movie Buff's Guide Of Pretentious European Movies.This is close to a 2hour movie and yet very little unfolds. Dennehy predictably gets cheated by his ugly wife gets ill has a brief and predictable fling with the sister of the guy who is screwing his wife and then kills himself at the end. His death coincides with the birth of his child and we see Boulee's year of death right above his dead body. Frankly that kind of symbolism never gets me too excited. Dennehy's obsession with bellies and Boulee may hold some mysterious grip on Greenaway and maybe some of his more rabid followers as well but it doesn't exactly offer anything of significance or even depth. Tossing historical architectural and art references left and right does not a great movie make. Again I can get all that information on the internet by watching a documentary or reading. Not that I was annoyed by that but it boggles the mind why some film fans wet their pants over this kind of thing.It was predictable that at least one of the main three characters would die at the end. I was even a bit surprised that there wasn't more tragedy happening with perhaps a scuffle knives stabbing bellies people losing their noses heads rolling into bins... Greenaway never shied away from bombastic conclusions. Suicide rape or murder how else could the movie end? Greenaway was fortunate to have had someone like Dennehy because quite frankly the rest of the cast was miserably uninteresting and flat.This brings me to my main criticism. Dennehy comes to Italy  not Mars  and yet the behaviour that he encounters is that of a bunch of very rude stonefaced evil Romans that seem to have been shipped straight from planet Greenaway to our little Earth. Whether the director has something concrete against the Italian people or whether he was just being typically weird in the worst Europeancinema tradition I don't know. The interaction between the American guest and the Italians is usually illogical sometimes strange and often just plain silly. An example of the latter would be the way Dennehy punches some brash young Italians on two occasions. If you wanna be weeeeeird then be weird all the way instead of creating a movie that remains undecided whether it wants to be realistic or allout experimental.".

	schema:headline " Longing for his flat belly days?";
	schema:reviewBody "Perhaps it is a midlife crisis and a fear of death that simultaneously hits Chicago architect Stourley Kracklite Brian Dennehy. He has traveled to Rome to present an elaborate tribute to the French architect Louis Boullee. Kracklite is fiftyfour years old uncertain that he has fulfilled the promise of his youth. He is married to a woman Chloe Webb young enough to be his daughter. So when he begins to develop stomach pains perhaps due to a growing stomach tumor while working in Rome and gets no satisfaction from doctors he begins to believe his wife is poisoning him. Furthermore it appears that she is having an affair with an Italian architect named Caspasian Lambert Wilson who also desires to take over Kracklite's Boullee project. I think a lot of men in their fifties can identify with these sorts of threats to their wellbeing and perhaps be unable to tell the real from the unreal.So the human belly is a big deal in this film. At one point Kracklite prints out scores of photocopies of the belly of a Roman statue as if in scrutinizing mass copies of a flat belly he might somehow explain why he is in pain. Or perhaps the flat belly symbolizes his lost youth and the insecure feeling he has about the affection and faithfulness of Louisa his young wife. Maybe it is even the case that the belly is a euphemistic symbol of something else that is no longer as vital as it once was. When men in their fifties worry about such things they also worry about their ability not just to cut the mustard but the quality of their work. In short they worry about being superseded. One cannot help but feel in this case that Kracklite's growing paranoia is in part responsible for his declining power. Fear of something may give it strength.As for the way cinematic auteur Peter Greenaway directs this film I think his intent is to let the film reflect the subject matter in the sense that both are of artistic intent rather than the movie being a commercial enterprise. That is perhaps an understatement. He shows the beauty of the architectural ruins of Rome. He thinks in terms of tableaux in wide shots. He picks a backdrop and sets the camera at some distance from the backdrop Italian ruins a spacious lobby expansive steps in front of an impressive building. And then he plays the scene. Unlike most modern directors he mostly eschews closeups. I'd rather he didn't. The effect is like being in a theater watching a play. There is a certain appropriateness I suppose about this technique since it creates in the viewer a feeling of spying which is exactly what Kracklite finds himself doing in one scene looking through a keyhole to see what his wife and Capasian are doing and Greenaway has us see too at the same distance.In another sense there is a studied feel to this movie that suggests something a bit cold like marble which again is appropriate. Yet Brian Dennehy in an intense engaging performance makes us feel for him and his predicament.

	onyx:emotionText "Perhaps it is a midlife crisis and a fear of death that simultaneously hits Chicago architect Stourley Kracklite Brian Dennehy. He has traveled to Rome to present an elaborate tribute to the French architect Louis Boullee. Kracklite is fiftyfour years old uncertain that he has fulfilled the promise of his youth. He is married to a woman Chloe Webb young enough to be his daughter. So when he begins to develop stomach pains perhaps due to a growing stomach tumor while working in Rome and gets no satisfaction from doctors he begins to believe his wife is poisoning him. Furthermore it appears that she is having an affair with an Italian architect named Caspasian Lambert Wilson who also desires to take over Kracklite's Boullee project. I think a lot of men in their fifties can identify with these sorts of threats to their wellbeing and perhaps be unable to tell the real from the unreal.So the human belly is a big deal in this film. At one point Kracklite prints out scores of photocopies of the belly of a Roman statue as if in scrutinizing mass copies of a flat belly he might somehow explain why he is in pain. Or perhaps the flat belly symbolizes his lost youth and the insecure feeling he has about the affection and faithfulness of Louisa his young wife. Maybe it is even the case that the belly is a euphemistic symbol of something else that is no longer as vital as it once was. When men in their fifties worry about such things they also worry about their ability not just to cut the mustard but the quality of their work. In short they worry about being superseded. One cannot help but feel in this case that Kracklite's growing paranoia is in part responsible for his declining power. Fear of something may give it strength.As for the way cinematic auteur Peter Greenaway directs this film I think his intent is to let the film reflect the subject matter in the sense that both are of artistic intent rather than the movie being a commercial enterprise. That is perhaps an understatement. He shows the beauty of the architectural ruins of Rome. He thinks in terms of tableaux in wide shots. He picks a backdrop and sets the camera at some distance from the backdrop Italian ruins a spacious lobby expansive steps in front of an impressive building. And then he plays the scene. Unlike most modern directors he mostly eschews closeups. I'd rather he didn't. The effect is like being in a theater watching a play. There is a certain appropriateness I suppose about this technique since it creates in the viewer a feeling of spying which is exactly what Kracklite finds himself doing in one scene looking through a keyhole to see what his wife and Capasian are doing and Greenaway has us see too at the same distance.In another sense there is a studied feel to this movie that suggests something a bit cold like marble which again is appropriate. Yet Brian Dennehy in an intense engaging performance makes us feel for him and his predicament. We understand that he is realizing his mortality and we appreciate that his reaction is understandably confused and frightened. As for his wife she seems distant not only because of the camera work but perhaps because she is psychologically estranged from her husband and from what he is going through.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

The 80s were the times of the fiction films and 'the Belly of an Architect' is one of his best and most known.This is the story of an American architect coming to the eternal city to prepare an exhibition dedicated to the revolutionary 18th century architect Etienne Louis Boulee. He soon finds he is sick and his life and career go down on spiral as his younger and pregnant wife starts to cheat on him with one of his Italian assistants. The principal role is played by Brian Dennehy who plays probably the best role in his career of more than 140 films by now a role so far from the typical Irish cop roles he is usually cast in.The story line is quite linear but the quality of the acting and the special cinematography makes it stand in front of the crowd. Very few films succeeded to catch in image Rome so beautifully and certainly Greenaway is one of the few to have done so. The film is full of references to architecture and art and it is a delight to follow the composition of the scenes resembling paintings from the masters. It is not an usual film its unusual beauty asks to be discovered and lies in the details but it's worth exploring and finding it.".

The film manages to appear beguilingly simple and yet it deals with such issues as class aspiration loyalty identity and love.The way in which all the characters slowly but surely reveal their flaws and weaknesses is quite brilliant. Standout scenes include Arnie's bodybuilder character playing the fiddle yes the fiddle! with a bunch of hillbillies out in the woods Jeff Bridges' drunken jig and the sight of about a hundred pumpedup bodybuilders running almost naked through rush hour traffic which for me is one of the classic and most unexpected comic moments in cinema.I may think more of this film because I 'discovered' it almost by chance but I will always see it as an underrated classic and I urge everyone to seek it out.".

	schema:headline " Still quirky";
	schema:reviewBody "Although Stay Hungry feels like the filmmakers made it up as they went along it still gets you in mainly because of its overall quirkiness and interesting stars early in their careers. The story centres on Jeff Bridges' character Craig Blake and his attempts to buy a gym in Alabama in order to redevelop the site. However he is drawn into the lives of the people he meets including gym receptionist Mary Tate Farnsworth played by Sally Field and Joe Santo played by Arnold Schwarzeneger who is training for the Mr. Universe contest.The story meanders all over the place with many sub plots and characters while everyone goes to town on their Southern accents  all except The Austrian Oak of course.It's hard to place Stay Hungry in a genre it's a comedy of sorts but the humour is in the odd situations rather than in funny lines. To be honest it needed editing some scenes are interminable. For anyone watching it 40 years later the appeal must surely be in seeing the stars before their careers really took off.Arnie is arresting. This was his first speaking part he looks big chested and powerful but plays it low key he's a sensitive guy no Hasta la vista baby or I'll be back in this movie. His best scene is when he joins a group in the backwoods and indulges his passion for fiddle playing. Apparently he practiced the violin for months to look convincing.Sally Field was 29 when she made this a few years older than Jeff Bridges but looks as though she would have needed proof of age to get into a nightclub  it actually makes her brief nude scene slightly disturbing. Even now she still looks way younger than her real age check out 2015's My Name is Doris for confirmation.These days Jeff Bridges looks his years but like a bottle of Chteau Mouton Rothschild he simply improves with age. He has some good scenes in Stay Hungry including one where he does a little Appalachian flatfooting.With memories of Vietnam and Watergate still fresh filmmakers seemed affected by the mood of disillusionment and mistrust of the 1970's. They came up with some offthewall movies and the chaotic style of Stay Hungry fits perfectly into the era.".

The story is engrossing from start to finish and i was very surprised by how much i got into it. The only reason i rented it because it had Arnie and a good cast and thought it might be worthwhile and boy was it ever the characters were all likable and they were all developed well. There is no gore what so ever except when Craig gets a big gash in the back of his head other then that not a thing. This is a Drama i have not seen many Drama movies but this was a good one. there a re a few scenes actually that will make you giggle and plus Jeff Bridges and Sally Field have great chemistry together and it was really cool to see Arnie in a early role. The Acting AWESOME!!!!! Jeff Bridges is AMAZING here and gives a terrific performance i LOVED him!. Sally Field is was VERY cute and is a VERY good actress and it shows here good show!. Arnold Schwarzenegger cracked me up he did a heck of a job here in my opinion in his first major role other then Hercules in New York. Robert Englund does not have much to do here but it was also cool to see him in a early role also R.G. Armstrong does well here as the psycho he is in my opinion. Scatman Crothers does what he has to do very well here. Overall a must see if you can't find it at your local video store luckily i did then by all means track it down it's worth it!. 12 out of 5".

But up to that point I was a pure movie fan watching a young hot looking Jeff Bridges as countryclub son looking for his way after losing his parents I was fascinated as I compared him to the 2010 Oscar Winner for Crazy Heart. Catching Sally Field in one of her earliest film roles as an emotionally labile gym employee I was impressed and even blushed a little during a brief nude scene as I thought of the matriarch currently staring in ABC's Brothers and Sisters. Roger E. Mosley T.C. from Magnum P.I. was funny in a supporting role A young Robert Englund reminded me that he was an actor before he was Freddy Kruger and a host of other actors that I only know from old TV shows Fannie Flagg Ed Begley Jr. and Joanna Cassidy put me in trivia heaven. But it was Ahnold...Arnold Schwarzenegger who truly surprised me playing an attractive lowkey approachable role as an aspiring body builder. There was nothing overthetop or kitchy about his performance and I enjoyed every scene he was in. If you can forgive the hokey ending which made me think of a cheesy Gay Pride parade although I'm sure that was unintentional then you can really enjoy this movie.If you don't enjoy catching actors from the 80's in their early years might I suggest you be very bored busy with other household activities and catching it on cable first  or else you'll just hate yourself afterward and wish for that time back.".

Those who are acquainted with Arnold's career and his biography know that staying hungry was one of the main lifeguidelines in his whole life. A strongwilled persistent goaloriented perfectionist who was fighting all his life and guess what  he has won! Geez people stop looking at Arnold as just a Terminator and governor of CA  you have a great rolemodel right in front of you to learn from about how true persistence brings you to your goals. FANTASTIC is a MUST READ if you're looking for something truly inspiring and motivating I don't want to get too comfortable. I'd rather stay hungry. Keep this in mind a talent must be ALWAYS hungry.P.S. As for all those sexualabuse related scandals come one  in most European countries it's absolutely normal to flirt and hit on women compared to the U.S. where even an inappropriate look may get you in serious trouble which is absolutely ridiculous. Look at most of celebrities worldwide and the stuff they are doing on daily basis! Arnold is an angel compared to them plus consider what he has achieved in his life. As for steroids nearly EVERYONE was using them those days not something to really frown upon back then.".

FANTASTIC is a MUST READ if you're looking for something truly inspiring and motivating I don't want to get too comfortable. I'd rather stay hungry. Keep this in mind a talent must be ALWAYS hungry.P.S. As for all those sexualabuse related scandals come one  in most European countries it's absolutely normal to flirt and hit on women compared to the U.S. where even an inappropriate look may get you in serious trouble which is absolutely ridiculous. Look at most of celebrities worldwide and the stuff they are doing on daily basis! Arnold is an angel compared to them plus consider what he has achieved in his life. As for steroids nearly EVERYONE was using them those days not something to really frown upon back then.";

Doubtless that this is a correct assumption but is there any thing else out there something obvious that we are overlooking? Well the previous year we saw a United Artists release of CoWriterDirector Bob Raphelson's STAY HUNGRYUA '76. It had a great cast of character actors that made for a smooth coherent FarceDramaComedy that had competitive Bodybuilding as its central theme. Starring the future supersuccessful Trio of Jeff Bridges Sally Field and Arnold Schwarzenagger.But rather than concentrating on the Physical Culture aspects of the story our screenplay investigates some of our other virtues and vices which are universal to all mankind. And that's not to say that the background and peripheral happenings are documented. The out and out living agony of the daily grind is touched on. This alone is great evidence that these guys train as hard or harder than any athletes period. However the storyline investigates all of the Human Virtues and Vices that we see in every other walk of life. We examine loyalty betrayal love Sex envy selflessness desire and fulfillment. Whereras we have a Bodybuilding Story it is much more.The story implores us to maintain our enthusiasm to take what life offers no matter if it concerns Biceps Definition Separation Bulk Vascularity etc. etc...And as a final thought Miss Sally Field speaks very fondly about her participation in STAY HUNGRY. She recalled in some interview that it was her role as Mary Tate Farnsworth that led to acceptance and opened the door to better things. At that time there was a certain stigma about Television Acting especially Sitcom players. They were considered to be on a lower wrung of the ladder and not taken so seriously. But after this film she did so much movie work and won a couple o' Oscars in the process. If there is a message here it may well be as the Sneakers Commercial says Just Do It! Or maybe we should take the advice of The Bard of Avon Mr. William Shakespeare when he said Above all to thine own self be true! Now this is certainly a case for 'being one's self! And let's have less of putting on the Dog. And we remember that a young Roger Ebert was really enthusiastic about this long before he discovered 'Thumbs'! NOTE  There is no mention of Anabolic Steroids in the story not that they weren't there.

Jeff Bridges plays the agent of the giant soulless conglomerate trying to buy up the health club where Ahnuhld is in training and his girlfriend Field ! is the secretary so they can build a highrisebut gets sidetracked and has to reassess his priorities.

Armstrong also seen as the general in Predator Ed Begley Jr. Birmingham TV personality Fannie Flagg and others. Armstrong absconds with the bodybuilding exhibition gate receipts and ends up being chased from Boutwell Auditorium down 20th Street through downtown B'ham and Five Points by a hundred or so bodybuilders dressed in even less than Ms. Field's Bikiniabout enough material in all to halffill a bushel basket. Not bad if you're so inclined. Years later I was bicycling down Lakeshore Drive in Mountain Brook and went right by the house used as Bridges' residence. Recognized it immediately. I also suspect from the dialog that there were more nude scenes involving Ms. Field Mr. Bridges and a bathtub that ended up on the cutting room floor. At one point she says to him ...the bath's ready... Although nothing of this nature has appeared in 28 years I remain on the lookout. Bottom line an excellent puffpiece hardly of earthshaking significance but still highly recommended.".

Best Acting Debut In A Motion Picture. How that works when it isn't his movie debut I don't know but win he did. His performance is OK I don't think it's great but it's OK. The movie actually belongs to a charming turn by Jeff Bridges and the always cute Sally Field. I remember the joy of seeing Field naked in this as a kid!! I'd fancied her since Smokey  The Bandit. Future Freddy Kruger Robert Englund is here in a supporting role and future Sly co star Joe Spinell has a small role too. In his autobiography Total Recall Arnie talks about how director Bob Raffleson asked him to take acting lessons and drop down from 240 pounds to 210. This meant he had to retire from competing at bodybuilding competitions. Despite good reviews United Artists didn't know how to market the movie and it failed at the box office. Arnie was sent on The Mike Douglas show to promote it with Sally Field and to show the 50 year old how to excercise. It was advertised in gyms and gym magazines. Arnie felt it should have been advertised as 'A Bob Raffleson picture starring Jeff Bridges and Sally Field' and then let the bodybuilding be a surprise.I think sold differently Stay Hungry could have done differently. 610".

But that's a shell of the story only dealt with as the film winds down it's second half. Field America's TV sweetheart gets to show off her assets in a few nude scenes which doesn't besmerch her reputation or make me look at her any less but considering her meteoric rise to film immortality just a few years later this isn't a great switch for her from the to the big screen.Such familiar faces as Ed Begley Jr. Scatman Crothers and Fannie Flagg appear in smaller parts but it's mainly about Fields and Bridges with slice of life views of life in a small southern community. Really nothing happens to move the plot along. Talkie moments seem to try to manipulate the audience into thinking that something is happening but that's rarely the case here. Crothers comes out of nowhere to tell Bridges that he's quitting threatening to take an iron suit with him and Fields and Bridges get into fights at Flagg's elaborate gettogether. One of the gym's female instructors teaches women karate as self defense and later uses it on the thugs who break in. Eventually this gets boring and dismal seriously pointless making me wonder if the film was just horribly edited.

A lot of the traps are reminiscent of Home Alone with chemicals and bigger tech.Along with all the gadgetry one of the things that Rollie is known for is his avoidance of guns. He's a MacGyver in that way. However this can go too far. In one scene he grabs the assassin's gun in the aquarium while he's being drowned. Then for some reason he leaves it behind for the assassin to pick up and shoot at him. It's annoying when smart characters do stupid things. This is simply inferior to the original.

A Police agent  asks Rollie to help him to make a setup for chase a psychokiller . As Rollie accepts because the cop is the exhusband Tom Mason  of his new girlfriend Rachel Ticotin and he carries out the execution the phony work . The operation was going well when allegedly another murderer kills the cop . When corrupt agents double cross him on the staging the fake assassination Rollie finds himself embroiled in a deadly coverup and he uses his special effects to trap the corrupt agents . Obviously a chief police is involved with the death  but when the things get worse Rollie calls on Leo MacCarthy Brian Dennehy   confronting both of them a corrupt system . The whiz Rollie and Leo team up once more to use their special effects and advanced technology to find those responsible for the death of the cop . Rollie must use his movie magic and wits to discover the true guilty  survive and he becomes involved a mess that includes Mafia  Vatican and some golden medallions . As far as the story goes  it involves a bigger scale of corruption in the law enforcement circle .Entertaining but ordinary 1990'stype action thriller that has some nice parts as is fastpaced  well acted  engaging and thrilling film . It has exInspector Dennehy and FX wizard Brown in perfect form  developing an enjoyable relationship between the crimebusting buddies . Furthermore good secondaries as Rachel Ticotin  Kevin J O'Connor  Joanna Gleason  Philip Bosco  all of them make fine performances . Some moments were predictable  but for the most part  it was finelypaced with action scenes efficiently handed and some good intrigue and mystery . There are some very exciting scenes as well as some ingenious special effects including the final setup that resolves prominently the intrigue . The cinematography by Victor J. Kemper and editing are functional . Decent musical score fitting to action by Lalo Schifrin though excessive use of synthesizer . Action is pretty nicely done and fast moving with some engaging gimmickry provided by means of Animatronics and a telemetry suit  enabling the wearer to control a clown's movements via remote control that includes piloting a helicopter . The motion picture is professionally directed by Richard Franklin Road games  Psycho II Patrick. This is an acceptable if somewhat belated following to surprise hit realized in 1986 that was a Sleeper titled FX  Murder by illusion  the sequel FX2 however the entire thing is nowhere near as exciting and interesting . It's followed followed by an amiable TV series .".

	schema:reviewBody "FX 2 turned out to be a better sequel that I was expecting as a result of what I had heard people say about it over the years. I was glad to see Bryan Brown and Brian Dennehy share more scenes together this time around they only had one in the first film and I was also surprised that the story was pretty good in the same league as the first. Sure some parts were predictable nearly every film has got some predictability to it but for the most part it was nicelypaced with some good suspense and mystery. I was hoping for a better usage of special effects by the characters after all the series is called FX but Brown pretty much just MacGyvers his way through the film especially in the supermarket sequence one of the film's standout scenes. My personal favorite was the scene in Brown's apartment where he uses an animatronic remotecontrolled clown to handle an assassin who like Cliff DeYoung in the first film mysteriously vanishes from the movie without a trace and the battle at the mansion at the end of the film is pretty exciting with Brown making use of a bunch of effects equipment to stop the bad guys. Allinall a pretty decent sequel that has me torn between which of the two films I like more. I really can't decide. I know it's been eleven years and since this one apparently didn't perform as well at the box office as the first one did I doubt we'll ever see an FX 3 but I wouldn't mind seeing it.".

	schema:headline " Entertaining but Typical 1980'stype Action Thriller that Had Greater Potential";
	schema:reviewBody "The glaring shortcoming of FX 2 is that the main thrust of the plot i.e. the what and why of the baddies is not revealed until an hour or so into the film. At 109 minutes that's well over halfway. Certainly the point was to pop our main character Rollie Tyler reprised by Bryan Brown from the first movie into a life and death situation beyond his comprehension and not until several clues are followed revealed that he and we find out what these circumstances are.Briefly Rollie the Australian special effects wizard is hired again by the FBI to aid in cornering a serial killer. However the plan goes awry when the FBI man who was supposed to stop the suspect in his tracks is killed by another unknown killer. Rollie finds himself also caught in a web of intrigue. And of course when he is on the verge of getting snuffed out Dennehy as Leo McCarthy pops in to save his ass. Not a bad opening all things considered.Finally Leo uncovers the back story which I won't reveal lest I be accused of giving it away as they say. However the back story is described almost offhandedly without even a flashback. Unfortunately the downside is that with very little screen time left neither the history of what's behind the bad guys' motivations nor the bad guys themselves are ever fully developed. I found myself wanting to know more about the circumstances surrounding this back story the what and the why. Of course with these kinds of movies a lot of screen time must be devoted to the baddies chasing the innocent bystanders in shopping malls or in car chases. I guess it's a Hollywood law that American filmmakers must devote a specified minimum amount of time to choreographed running around and shooting so they can legitimately call their project an action movie.Still the film has its entertainment value. There is a strange chemistry that exists between Brian Dennehy reprising his role has Leo McCarthy and Bryan Brown and again I wish that had been milked for all its worth. Of course the most entertaining sequence like the first installment is the use of movie effects to thwart the bad guys which works very well. Maybe I appreciated it as a breath of fresh air from the typical cat and mouse chase with automatic weapons that typically climaxes most of these kinds of films.Still very much in the style of a 1980's action movie although this was 1991 with the typical rock songs spliced in for good measure. With the exception of the use of the special effects against the baddies at the finale storywise it is really the equivalent of a twopart episode of Simon and Simon with a larger budget.".

Truthfully the story is not very good and ultimately is only there to serve as a means to connect various action and jovial banter scenes together.

The director has only done one other thing that I'd even heard of at all Psycho II and that single fact sums it up so perfectlythough that one was considerably worse I almost don't want to add anything to it.

If you saw the original liked the concept but didn't enjoy the movie check out FX2 you'll be pleasantly surprised.

The witty banter between the characters is pretty much survivable. But under no circumstances should a person attempt to pay close attention to this movie.

	schema:reviewBody "Hard Boiled is my number 1 favorite Hong Kong John Woo action film that I love to death! I absolutely love this movie to death I love it. It is one of my personal favorite movies. Hard Boiled 1992 is literally John Woo's best Hong Kong action film ever made of all time! The movie is a hardcore action I have ever seen. It is actually the best Hong Kong action film for me. It belongs right up there with Terminator 2 Judgment Day 1991 the best action classic film of all time. Chow YunFat toothpick in mouth a gun in each hand. That's all of the plot you need to know. In fact this is THE best pure action epic ever filmed. This is my film my personal favorite Hong Kong action film of all time.Give the guy a gun and he's superman give him two and he's God.Not even Jackie Chan can mess with this film or beat it. The only Jackie Chan film that is close to this film is Police Story. In my opinion Hard Boiled is John Woo's best HK action movie from the 90's and a true masterpiece along with Hard Target 1993 his first American movie with JeanClaude Van Damme in the main role. Chow YunFat stars as Tequila a cop hellbent on bringing down the gun smugglers responsible for his partner's death. He teams up with an undercover cop Tony Leung whose secret identity as a Triad hit man hangs on thread.Hard Boiled is my favorite John Woo's HK action movies. This action movie with twists around The Hong Kong Cinema Hard Boiled has everything in it no CGI the stunts are real the explosions are bigger and the plot of the film is amazing you can get in to the story without guessing what is going to happened and what the plot is about. The warehouse scenes and a shooting a motorcycles in an explosions from Tequila is my favorite scenes in the movie. Sometimes to me it come for this movie is similar to Miami Vice when Tony Leung was undercover cop on a boat he remind me on Sonny Crockett but the shout outs in this film are awesome. Just Miami Vice TV series where more about drug cartels this is arms dealer weapons about triads. The stunts are real and very dangerous. There was a hospital siege which was actually Die Hard in a hospital. Hard Boiled is a classic action film from Hong Kong they don't make movies like this anymore. Phillip Chan is also in this film which I forgot to mention in my review Philip Chan was also in Van Damme's Bloodsport. You have a great action sequences in the tea house where the guns are hitting in the bird cage he shoots a dozen guys and saves a baby the hospital sequences are real. The first time I saw this film I had no idea that how great film it is the greatest movie of all time in the cinema. John Woo is also as a bartender in this film. The hospital sequences for me is real the action is real. The best Chow YunFat and John Woo movie ever made. Hard Boiled is a 1992 Hong Kong action film written by Barry Wong and directed by John Woo. It stars Chow Yunfat as Inspector Tequila Yuen Tony Leung ChiuWai1010 I love this movie to death it is my favorite Hong Kong Action film and it is my second favorite film that I love. It is also my number 2 favorite action film.".

	schema:reviewBody "When someone mentions action movie the first thing that gets in their minds is guns fighting blood and so on. The people who they instantly think are the likes of Schwarzenegger Stallone Willis even the hammy Seagal Snipes and Van Damme! Not until recently I found myself confused about which action movie is the greatest. For me the ultimate action hero is Arnold Schwarzenegger but I cannot seem to find a perfect action movie.Until I began checking up films of John Woo and stumbled upon this baby...Only a handful of action movies can compare to this but most fail to be better. This movie IS the epitome of an action movie it has neverending thrillaminute stylish action sequences that just make your jaw drop in amazement. It has a body count that can be compared to most epic movies and it has an excellent atmosphere to further enhance the story. The action sequences are a combination of outrageous unreal and cool at the same time.The story is weak but not very. It provides the basis for the action to unfold. And boy when it does you'll have a blast! I mean they took the premise of a basic cops and robbers tale and highly jazzed it up somehow to deliver this truly authentic and unique piece of movie making. This is not just a movie which action fans alone should see this movie deserves to be sought and recognized by other highlyranked film critics.The director John Woo ups the ante on this one. After glorifying the gangsters in his Better Tomorrow movies and The Killer which almost is as good as Hard Boiled he decides to glorify the cops and he does that but with bigger elements. He doesn't show realism and humanism in this film because he wanted to emphasize and slightly exaggerate on how big the elements can go. The criminals would kill lots of innocent people to complete their nefarious deeds and the violence is hyperstylized to the point where it becomes necessary to subdue the criminals using that technique. He combines unique Chinese Opera dancing techniques and dramatic shootouts to create stylistically significant and exhilarating gunfights for the eyes and ears to behold. The pace is hyper kinetic as Woo relentlessly dishes out whatever tricks he has up his sleeve much to our delight.Chow YunFat's status as an action hero is immortalized here in his performance as super cop Tequila who dodges bullets and shoot crooks while cooing a baby to sleep and covering his eyes from the ensuing violence. This scene also signifies the violence in Hong Kong back in the days but highly stylized to create a superb action experience. Tony Leung is also splendid as the disillusioned undercover cop who seeks to regain his humanity and reputation. The rest of the cast gave good performances with kudos to Anthony Wong as the sadistic villain who will do anything to get what he wants fully exampled during the film's climax and Cheng JueLuh as one of the most badassed villains ever Mad Dog.The atmosphere of the movie further improves its credibility. John Woo's interests are shown through Tequila's passion of jazz and the beautiful and dark cinematography of Hong Kong which when combined together gives an effect that signifies two different worlds that is the life of a cop and the life of a criminal. Also the music score by Michael Gibbs is great with a perfect melodramatic jazz score during dramatic scenes and to pumping synthesizers gritty and haunting scores during the majority of the action sequences. All of these add up to the amazing elements of the movie to make it even better.Overall I cannot think of any other action movie than this. This is THE action movie for filmgoers critics and action junkies alike. This perfectly shot ballet of blood and bullets is an example of how great and reliable Asian movies can be when we are finally tired of clich elements from Hollywood. Mr. Woo Your Midas Touch has its full effect here. This movie is one of the greatest action movies ever made. And I will stand by that decision for as long as I live.A must see.910Delton".

	schema:reviewBody "If you're the average IMDB reader you probably enjoy a good action movie every now and then but you approach action films with a certain caution and skepticism I can't blame you even though I am an action junkie myself. If you're that kind of viewer the score I would give for you for Hardboiled is a 6.5. To you this is a prototypical good action movie  intense perfectly executed original action shown to the tune of a forgettable and occasionally insulting story.To action junkies this movie is an easy 9 because the only thing that really matters is that the action is superb and the other elements if not stellar don't detract enough from the action to really make a difference.Splitting the difference we get an 810  an outstanding score.Hardboiled is the ultimate John Woo  ChowYun Fat collaboration. Chow plays an uncompromising HongKong cop who works together with an undercover cop an EXCELLENT Tony Leung in the triad gunrunning organization. Now when I say works I mean launches thousands of bullets slugs and explosive projectiles into HUNDREDS of mafioso baddies. This film has a RIDICULOUS amount of gunplay. Pretty much everyone you see on screen dies at some point. Those that don't die often come perilously close to dying before getting up and moving on as if nothing had happened. The gunmen in this film have magical powers that enable them to fire about 100 rounds from a Beretta clip without having to reload. And the top good guys seem only vaguely concerned about the loss of innocent life  at a teahouse or a large hospital  except for tiny baby life of course  as long as they get to kill the top triad guy. And the story... well... not incoherent but completely implausible at many points.Realistic? NO. Is the story good? NO. Is this relevant? Not particularly. You see one watches a John Woo movie for two things Strong lead characters strong lead characters shooting their way to success in surreally choreographed gunplay scenes. But what if I don't want to watch a movie just for that? Well this one forces you to! If you can stand action at all you'll be glued to the screen the entire time. Chow is a good actor and Tony Leung is probably even better here  they make the obligatory story sequences compelling and when they start firing their weapons you can't take your eyes away. Slowmotion highlights bullets explosions and plaster and sparks flying every which way even as the actors and stunt men acrobatically move through the air while evading enemy fire. It's a little hard to describe how great this really is so you just have to take my word for it. Suffice it to say that no one does gunplay like Woo although everyone and their mother tries. James Cameron's technique with heavy weapons and muscular guys is the other way to do gunplay and is great in its own more limited right. If you're a fan of FaceOff an American John Woo movie that actually does not suck you know what to expect  but multiply that by 100.The story and realism are not good but this makes no difference. Suspend disbelief and go with the flow and you're treated to primequality action. There ARE however elements of this film that drag it down quite a bit. Most of them to me concern Woo's depictions of violence. It's obvious the man revels in blood. Several times you see blood spurt copiously and unnaturally  onto a wall a desk even a man's or baby's face. While the action is generally frantic and quick these shots are slow deliberate and inyourface. Why? To cater to our basest instincts like a cheap slasher film. With action scenes and character acting done so well it's embarrassing to watch such gratuitous gore added into the mix. But that's not all! The script's good characters are not morally corrupt You can see them actively trying to avoid other cops or innocent bystanders. This is superficial. The characters aren't corrupt the final script is. At least 50 innocent people including patients at a hospital die violently. The film doesn't display this as a horrific event but rather as part of the scenery cannon fodder the film even gets pretty despicable amusement from this particularly in one scene involving a baby don't worry! the baby is not hurt.Technically speaking the movie is perfect. Aesthetically speaking the same is true with the exception of the music which is extremely cheesy at times the sax that suddenly kicks in during emotional moments is unbearable  is that some kind of HK movie thing or what?.Such negatives are distracting. Your ability to ignore such distractions will ultimately determine if you give this a 5 or a 9. Were it a little more humane I'd give it a 9. As it stands I give it 810.".

	schema:reviewBody "As far as gun battles go Hard Boiled is a good HK action movie in a Woo  Yun Fat style. I don't love the film to death like I used too. I like the film it is enjoyable it has ton's of action and multiple gun fire and explosions. The movie too me is way too long and become by time to time boring. I think the melodrama music slowdown the film. I thought Teresa Mo standing in the hospital watching babies really slowed down the film and hurt it. I didn't care seeing naked baby in the hospital and that hurt the film for me.Hard Boiled is the ultimate John Woo  ChowYun Fat collaboration is their fifth and last film they worked together. It is the last John Woo film that he worked in China before he moved to America making American movies. It is definitely American favorite film over The Killer. I would say Hard Target is a MILES way better John Woo movie a better action movie than Hard Boiled I have enjoy Hard Target much more than Hard Boiled that's my opinion. Hard Target is one man army type movie this is a buddy cop movie too me that I am not interested.Chow YunFat is Tequila Yuen a cop hellbent on bringing down the gun smugglers responsible for his partner's death. He teams up with an undercover cop Tony Leung whose secret identity as a Triad hitman hangs by a thread.I enjoy the gun fight in teahouse which is one of the best shootouts in the film during the opening sequence. Chow YunFat has a toothpick in a mouth and two guns in his hand and he looks like Marion Cobra Cobretti from Cobra but he is different type of a cop who is after a gun smugglers. Tequila slides down the stairs on the fence shoots two bad guys in the back with two guns. Goes against a hitman in the kitchen who fires an Uzi automatic weapon at him in the teahouse.The warehouse action sequences Tequila drops several smoke bombs into the warehouse than bungee jumps with a rope flying like superman firing with MP5A3 Heckler  Koch automatic weapon on a Johnny Wong's Anthony Wong thugs provoking a fierce battle. He engages them all like a one man army pure badass against 30 tycoons in the warehouse. Uses Mossberg 500 Cruiser shotgun killing dozen of badguys. Tequila shooting at motorcycles with his shotgun in which a motorcycle turns into flammable explosion is my favorite scene in the movie. The gunfire on Alan's yacht with Tequila and Alan against three assassins is another favorite action sequence of mine. Tequila comes facetoface with Alan with two of them pointing their guns at each others heads is a memorable scene in the film. These are the reasons that the movie is enjoyable good fun.The film also stars Tony Leung Philip Chan Phillip ChungFung Kwok and Teresa Mo. It is a 90's action film and I would say it is the best Hong Kong film ever. Philip Chan highranking police officer plays Supt. Pang says this was a real police work. Many criticized John Woo portraying only gangsters in his movies so this is dedicated to police and only to the police. I didn't like the hospital sequence that much at one point there is a sound of Alan Silvestri's famous Predator music score. Tequila and Alan been a buddy cops in the hospital sequence I didn't like that much. This movie should have been more one man army type I would like it more.I enjoy the Rambo movies much more all 4 films are better action movies Hard Target is a better action movie too me. Broken Arrow another John Woo movie get's criticism for trying something different it is a better action movie. Predator 1 and 2 are better action movies. John Wick 1 and 2 are better action movies I have enjoy them more. Cobra 1986 is much better action cop movie. Showdown in Little Tokyo Lethal Weapon Die Hard all 4 films I would put them over this film. The Last Boy Scout RoboCop Aliens Terminator 2 Judgment Day The Terminator Commando Demolition Man Double Impact Cliffhanger Death Warrant The Long Kiss Goodnight Beverly Hills Cop 1 and 2 there are more actioners I enjoy than Hard Boiled but this is a damn good HK action movie in a gunplay Woo  Yun Fat style.".

	onyx:emotionText "As far as gun battles go Hard Boiled is a good HK action movie in a Woo  Yun Fat style. I don't love the film to death like I used too. I like the film it is enjoyable it has ton's of action and multiple gun fire and explosions. The movie too me is way too long and become by time to time boring. I think the melodrama music slowdown the film. I thought Teresa Mo standing in the hospital watching babies really slowed down the film and hurt it. I didn't care seeing naked baby in the hospital and that hurt the film for me.Hard Boiled is the ultimate John Woo  ChowYun Fat collaboration is their fifth and last film they worked together. It is the last John Woo film that he worked in China before he moved to America making American movies. It is definitely American favorite film over The Killer. I would say Hard Target is a MILES way better John Woo movie a better action movie than Hard Boiled I have enjoy Hard Target much more than Hard Boiled that's my opinion.

During the film he come across a deadly assassin Tony Tony Leung who may or may not be an undercover police officer.The film's plot is pretty good considering with several double crosses good twists and the bonding relationship of Leung and Fat. However this is all about the action scenes and these are spectacular. Full of highly stylish violence double handed gunplay and exciting near misses. Fat and Leung are both excellent in their roles but the stars here are the action scenes.The only problem with this is that it is very violent and may be a turn off for some.

	schema:reviewBody "Master of Action John Woo delivers once again with his hardhitting actionpacked thriller Hard Boiled' starring Chow YunFat as a veteran cop known as Tequila' Hong Kong's answer to San Francisco's own Dirty Harry.' In this one an undercover officer infiltrates a gangland Triad dealing arms and when a rival gang threatens to take over Tequila joins in the melee and once it begins the action never stops until the last of the credits have rolled off into the recesses of the darkened screen.  Along the way there are tests of loyalty mistaken identities and a staggering display of superbly choreographed violence. There's a couple of plot twists but it's a rather straightforward story and as usual Woo melds it with the action with his trademark style and perfection.  The action sequences are incredibly well staged and delivered but so exceedingly violent that it passes beyond reality at times especially during the climax into a somewhat surreal state of being only to be ultimately drawn back in again by the grounded core of the story. It's a fine line that Woo treads successfully time after time in an arena in which many other action' directors have foundered.  A consummate professional Woo knows exactly what he wants and what works and he doesn't quit until he gets it.  Among the directors of the action' genre he is quite simply the best there has ever been. As the somewhat jaded and hard Boiled' cop the charismatic Chow YunFat demonstrates that if Jackie Chan can team up with Chris Tucker he most certainly could find a place at Eastwood or Gibson's side.  He has the attitude and the look that make his character credible which helps anchor Woo's art in reality albeit a rather violent one.  As with the Dirty Harry' or Lethal Weapon' movies it gives the audience someone to whom they can relate and root for.  And it's all buoyed with symbolism and metaphor and Woo's impeccable sense of timing and deft and sparing use of slow motion which in his hands becomes an extremely effective tool. The supporting cast includes Tony Leung Chiu Wai AlanTeresa Mo Teresa Chang Philip Chan Superintendent Pang HoiShan Kwan Mr. Hui and Philip Kwok Mad Dog.  The true brilliance of Woo's films lies in the fact that he never sacrifices story for action but instead blends the two together to create a whole that is artistically rendered his action sequences are something akin to visual poetry and  substantial rather than having an action film that like so many others of the genre is hollow inside.  Like his earlier film The Killer' which also starred YunFat Hard Boiled' pushes the envelope and will keep you on the edge right along with the characters in the film right until the very end.  As with all of Woo's movies this one is a satisfying foray into the intense cutting edge Action' world of one of Cinema's Master directors and a mustsee for any true film buff.  I rate this one 910.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you like movies with guns and action more guns and action this is your movie. Hard Boiled is simply the Best Action movie of all time. Hard Boiled is given the name Most Violent Movie by many critics when it first released. If you see this movie you'll know exactly why. John Woo is in my opinion the Best Action Movie director. If you see this movie carefully he does many Action Scenes in one camera take. One spectacular scene is the ending where the Hospital is hijacked and The Two Heroes are shooting there way out. Its like a computer game a shoot em up that reminds you of Virtual Cop. The scene shows both actors Shooting a dozen guys each and moving one place to another on the same floor of the hospital. This is a 2 minutes scene that was recorded in one take. This is one example of his great directions. Chow Yun Fat is brilliant as the hard boiled cop. Tony Leung is superb as the undercover cop and Hit man. This is a roller coaster ride of Violence and Entertains to the max.".

While the film generally has very positive reviews and a very good overall rating of 7.8 this is probably very deceiving as I ONLY think diehard ultraviolentultraaction loving people would enjoy this type of film and they traditionally flock to John Woo films. The average nonviolence junkie has probably never heard of Woo or if they have have no interest in such extremely graphic and violent fare.The first twenty or so minutes of the film I actually enjoyed though of course the film WAS megaviolent. At least there was some style and some sense of purpose to the killing. However after about 50 of the movie was past the rest of the film was one long long long extended scene of carnage. It was as if you took EVERY Rambo DieHard Death Wish and Steven Segal movie AS WELL AS THE KOREAN WAR AND WWII and combined them into one movie! There is no possible way to keep count but the number of good guys bad guys and assorted innocent bystanders killed in the movie seems like it must top 1000 and this is NOT an exaggeration. Initially this had a big impact on me however after a while it became downright boring. After all how many dead people fake blood and slowmotion death scenes can any NORMAL person take before they either turn off the film get sick or become bored.The bottom line is this is a wonderful film if you really could care less about plot and just want 100 carnage. Period. Oh and the plot device of having all the babies in the middle of the firefight near the end just seemed like a cheap way to build excitement. I mean think about it one minute the hero is cuddling a baby and the next he blows away a few bad guys then he nuzzles the little tyke. Is this meant to be tender or poignant?! Gimme a break. This movie is dumb and I really do wonder about the type of person who wants a steady diet of this. Okay now feel free to hit me with all your NOT HELPFUL commentsI am STILL right about this film!By the way although I hated the movie I really want to get a gun like the heroes had. You know the semiautomatic pistol that can fire 10 20 or even 30 times without needing to be reloaded!! And I want to find out where they got the hand grenades that when they blow up they only injure bad guyseven though the heroes might only be a couple feet away from the blast!!".

If you can turn that part of your brain off though and just approach the movie as pure imagery you will see some of the most creative action sequences ever caught on film.

Add to that Woo's moody Melvillelike camera work and the shadowy somber cinematography and you have a true action spectacle one that's even more effective if you're lucky enough to see it on the big screen.A classic one of the greatest action movies ever made.

	schema:reviewBody "When people start thinking that the United States is the only country with the directors that can make the great action flicks they can think again. John Woo is basically the James Cameron of China. And Woo's filmmaking skill is on the same level as Cameron's since he can make films that have great eyecandy action and a film that makes us identify and care about its characters.After seeing Hard Boiled I was completely blown away by the awesome gun fight scenes that were among the best my eyes ever witnessed. And there's plenty of it. The opening scene with the shootout at the teahouse is remembered for when Tequila Yun Fat Chow does a bunch of insane stunts like firing while jumping in midair and when he slides down the staircase handle and shoots the bad guys without getting hit. The warehouse betrayal will be known for the bad guys on the motorcycles shooting at the other bad guys and then Tony who is really an informant for the police betrays his gunrunner boss. And then that's when Tequila shows up and kicks a ton of ! There's even some shots of him shooting at the motorcycle engines and exploding them which is some of the coolest stuff I've ever seen. And last but not the least the climatic action scene at the hospital that lasts for over a halfhour and it displays a long continued shot that lasts for almost 3 minutes. And in that shot Tequila and Tony shoot every bad guy in sight and while talking some emotional lines I've never seen such a masterful shot like that until Children of Men. This movie has EVERYTHING grenades shotguns machine pistols and an entire arsenal of weapons that is shown in the hospital part. And we also have some suspense and emotional to along with the action since the hospital scene is very tense with all the babies in danger when Tequila tries to save them all while narrowly dodging bullets.And also the American audience probably liked the action because the setting was very different. We didn't see an American background or an American city like L.A but what we see is Hong Kong. And in the action sequences we see Chinese stuff getting blown up like in the teahouse for instance. We saw a bunch of Chinese pasta and tea of course getting smashed to bits. And it also works cause it's very unique compared to the same old American films that we get here in America.The acting also works YungFat Chow who is basically the Chinese Schwarzenegger due to his position as an action superstar is absolutely terrific as Tequila. Tequila is basically a maverick cop whose partner is killed during the teahouse shootout and seeks revenge against the Triad gang. However his boss is constantly pushing him over the edge and he has to deal with while disobeying orders to get to the Triads. And his character also delivers one of the most recognizable quotes in film history You're full of h!t you know that? There's a toilet over there. I bet that if it was an American film every person in the United States would be saying that in everyday situations next to Hasta la Vista baby and Yippiekiyay motherfker.And Tony Leung another Hong Kong superstar totally shines as the undercover cop who is infiltrating the gang of weapon smugglers. And his loyalty is tested on whether or not he'll be loyal to the Triads or to the cops. And also I'll remember his character for his faceoff with that bad guy with eye patch in the hospital forgot his name and then one scene they realize there are a bunch of innocent patients and they BOTH choose to let them go so they could finish their fight. But unfortunately the gang leader shows up and decides to kill them all and the eyepatch guy basically dies while standing up for what he believes is right that only the violent people should die. Very touching moment.If you're looking for a great foreign action film and if you're tired of watching too many Hollywood stuff then Hard Boiled is the film for you. The action is so insane that you'll probably see this over a hundred times before you die.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hardboiled. I just don't know where to begin except with that I just finished it. And all I can say is waaaaaaaa! Action!. Seriously the protagonist kills not one not two not three but eight people while holding a baby and that's shortly after rapping to it. The baby never cries but instead repays the favor later on it a most ridiculous way. At the rate people were dying in that movie I'm forced to conclude China simply has people to throw away. It pretty much hit every clich and all the characters were at least twice as accurate while involved in one of the million combat rolls that occurred.... even in the scenes without gun violence. It was the most actiony action movie to ever have action. Oh and the subtitles are pretty amusing in parts like when they conqueror the bad guys. Of the hundreds and hundreds of people slain in this movie the cops sustain the heaviest casualties rescuing babies! It didn't look like any of the seemingly limitless stockpile of babies was injured though. ACTION!!! So was it good? No not really but ACTION! I didn't even really enjoy the silliness until the second half but once I thought about it damn that would have been a fun movie to have been making fun of from the start. Maybe it's because it's early maybe it's because I just watched possibly more Chinese people gunned down than there were minutes in the film squared but my god I think you'll have fun watching this movie in the right mindset. After all what's better than grenade launchers acting like pump action shotguns? Or what about pump action shotguns that make whatever they hit explode? How about motorcyclists with uzis? Eye shooting? Blood splatter on babies getting mopped off in a tender moment?!?!?! Action. So... much... action... I won't believe people have to reload a gun unless they're shooting at good guys! for at least a week. On a website dedicated to movie body counts it's ranked 3 losing to two of the three lord of the ringses but I assure you Hard Boiled has none of that epic battle nonsense where kill count rains from the sky. Bullets fly people die especially if they come into contact with babies.".

Seriously the protagonist kills not one not two not three but eight people while holding a baby and that's shortly after rapping to it. The baby never cries but instead repays the favor later on it a most ridiculous way. At the rate people were dying in that movie I'm forced to conclude China simply has people to throw away. It pretty much hit every clich and all the characters were at least twice as accurate while involved in one of the million combat rolls that occurred.... even in the scenes without gun violence. It was the most actiony action movie to ever have action. Oh and the subtitles are pretty amusing in parts like when they conqueror the bad guys. Of the hundreds and hundreds of people slain in this movie the cops sustain the heaviest casualties rescuing babies! It didn't look like any of the seemingly limitless stockpile of babies was injured though. ACTION!!! So was it good? No not really but ACTION! I didn't even really enjoy the silliness until the second half but once I thought about it damn that would have been a fun movie to have been making fun of from the start. Maybe it's because it's early maybe it's because I just watched possibly more Chinese people gunned down than there were minutes in the film squared but my god I think you'll have fun watching this movie in the right mindset. After all what's better than grenade launchers acting like pump action shotguns? Or what about pump action shotguns that make whatever they hit explode? How about motorcyclists with uzis? Eye shooting? Blood splatter on babies getting mopped off in a tender moment?!?!?! Action. So... much... action... I won't believe people have to reload a gun unless they're shooting at good guys! for at least a week. On a website dedicated to movie body counts it's ranked 3 losing to two of the three lord of the ringses but I assure you Hard Boiled has none of that epic battle nonsense where kill count rains from the sky. Bullets fly people die especially if they come into contact with babies.";

	schema:reviewBody "Coeurs the latest achievement of French master Alain Resnais stands out as one of the finest European productions of 2006 a fact confirmed by the Silver Lion it was awarded in Venice. While the critics and audience at the festival were more anxious to see other films like The Black Dahlia or INLAND EMPIRE this small intimate bittersweet character study quietly moved towards well deserved recognition proving that the great New Wave director had lost none of his special touch.Like one of his best known films SmokingNo Smoking Coeurs is based on a play by Alan Ayckbourn. But whereas SmokingNo Smoking retained its untarnished Englishness Resnais makes it pretty clear that he's keeping his new work as distant as possible from its literary source the title is completely different as the French filmmaker thought Private Fears in Public Places was misleading in regards to the subject and the story is set in Paris with the inevitable and I might add quite brilliant changes in the dialogue that this requires.The film focuses on six people struggling to achieve or maintain meaningful relationships. There's the aging Thierry Andr Dussollier funny and heartbreaking at the same time who has to fight his feelings for his younger assistant Sabine Azma. There's his sister Gaelle Isabelle Carr who goes out on blind dates every night and always comes back hugely disappointed. There's Nicole Laura Morante a frustrated woman who's trying to find a nice apartment whilst dealing with her unemployed and increasingly detached boyfriend Dan Lambert Wilson. And there's Lionel Pierre Arditi a laconic revelation a lonely bartender who has to take care of his father the rude sexobsessed Arthur Claude Rich heard but not seen. Over the course of four days these characters will meet and affect each others'lives in unexpected amusing but also very touching ways.With this masterwork Resnais proves himself a true auteur telling us an apparently simple tale of love and longing with a direct honest approach from the hilarious beginning to the moving open conclusion. In adapting Ayckbourn's stage work he manages the impossible which is to make the movie look theatrical but not overly bizarre using subtle unpretentious tricks the speaking parts belong solely to the six leading actors plus Rich's priceless vocal cameo every single scene takes place indoors and the locations are always the same and most importantly sequences are linked by a metaphorical snowfall which gives the film a poetic almost magical feel.Those who thought Closer could have benefited from less swearing and more sympathy for its characters should watch Coeurs. It may not exactly end on a happy note but at least it doesn't risk sliding into misanthropy. Beneath the apparent pessimism there's a heart beating. The heart of an experienced director who hasn't stopped to amaze us.".

Artsy scenes not overused enrich the film throughout entire scene shot from overhead montage transformation of a conversation at a kitchen table to the snowy outdoors  just two most conspicuous examples. Nor does the movie shy away from clich comic situations when then are called for.This portrayal of ultimate loneliness in the urban alienation of the City of Lights is brought to the audience by an excellent cast of mostly director Alain Resnais' veterans.".

I like the way Resnais creates a whole universe half realistic half dreamlike with only six characters limited sets and omnipresent snow. These six characters struggle with loneliness butting against various obstacles  wrong match bad luck lack of will or perverse manipulation. The general atmosphere is kind of sad but in a cool and soft way snowy if I may say so and with humorous touches especially all that relates to videotapes and an invisible but perfectly audible grumpy old man played by Claude Rich which makes seven characters actually.

	schema:reviewBody "In seminal works such as Hiroshima Mon Amour and Last Year at Marienbad legendary French director Alain Resnais created a whole new vocabulary and grammar for film. His key innovation involved the creation of the timeshuffling narrative coupled with nearsubliminal quick cuts in the editing. Ironically his revolutionary style was appropriated so quickly by directors the world over that the technique became something of a cinematic clich almost overnight with even poor Resnais himself falling victim to his own success as his later films often felt as if they too were borrowing from the master. One can even detect Resnais' influence in such disparate American movies as Two For the Road and SlaughterhouseFive not to mention practically half of all the serious dramas that come our way these days i.e. 21 Grams Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Babel.Although his latest endeavor Private Fears in Public Places takes place pretty much in a linear time frame it still manages to tell three concurrently running stories of lost love each set in a slightly surreal Paris where people interact with one another in stylized settings and where snow falls relentlessly in the background. The cast of characters includes an exsoldier who has turned to alcoholism and indolence as a means of covering up a shameful event that happened to him while he was in the army his beautiful fianc who has grown increasingly frustrated by her boyfriend's indifference to her and the life he is leading a middleaged bartender who is having to cope with the increasingly violent temper of his irascible ailing father a compassionate deeply religious caregiver who forms a bond with the old man's son and a real estate agent who lives with his desperately lonely sister and who becomes fascinated by the pornographic tapes his seemingly primandproper coworker who is also the caregiver keeps loaning to him.As a longtime admirer of Resnais' work I wish I could say that I enjoyed Private Fears in Public Places more than I did. As a study of a group of lonely unhappy people trapped in a loveless world this extremely wellacted movie boasts a fair number of moving and even rather funny moments that perfectly capture the soulcrushing angst of modern life. The script is also commendably audacious in not providing a happilyeverafter ending for its characters. Yet for all its virtues the movie itself turns out to be less than the sum of its parts primarily due to its over length and the desultory pacing that drains much of the passion and energy out of the film. Resnais and writer JeanMichel Ribes  with Alan Ayckbourn's play as their blueprint  do a decent enough job making all the pieces of the narrative puzzle fit together into a grander scheme but the claustrophobic stage bound nature of the work ultimately makes us restless. And even though I acknowledge that it is probably that very iciness and claustrophobia that lie at the root of what the film is all about that realization doesn't make the movie any more entertaining to watch.Not a bad movie really just not one of his best.".

At first I must say I hadn't great expectations for this French adaptation of the British play Private Fears in Public Places by the acclaimed Alan Ackynbourn. I was wrong actor director screenwriter JeanMichel Ribes did a clever job with the script. The stories of the six characters intersect smoothly there are a few big laughs but the general mood of the film is bittersweet and pensive. The ending is in a way very pessimistic the very truetolife message is love is a dream and soon or later everybody has to wake up. The film shows remarkable acting. Italian Laura Morante was awarded with the Pasinetti award in Venice but the rest of the cast is very strong as well. Honorable mentions go to Pierre Arditi's sensitive performance and with lighter tones to Andr Dussollier's. Alain Resnais' direction winner of the Silver Lion at the latest Venice film festival left in the film a distinct theatrical feeling. The repeated image of the snowfall used between one scene and another is appropriate and poetic. Over all a good film  recommended. 810 in my book.".

	schema:reviewBody "I only discovered Resnais very recently when I saw the masterpiece Providence. Since then I've been keeping an eye out for his films so when this turned out to be showing as part of the French Film Festival I knew I had to see it.How would I rate it? At first I wasn't so sure. Although it had its hilarious moments right from the start I was starting to wonder if this was a film worth watching more than once. Indeed if it had been directed by anybody but Resnais it may not have been.It was in the second half though that the film really hit its stride. The meeting between Dan and Gaelle who up to that point were fairly uninteresting characters was superb and was quite realistic and engaging. This made the conclusion so much more heartwrenching even though the consequences did seem a little clichd. Also I immediately warmed to Andre Dussollier who is able to say so much with his facial expressions.Possibly the drawbacks were the characters of Nicole and Charlotte. It was hard to really sympathize with the former and I thought the latter was a little odd  it seemed like she was overacting for humorous effect which was fine but when it came to her making a serious point you weren't sure how to take it exactly. The whole porn thing was a little wacky as well and apart from creating some laughs seemed a little contrived.Those issues however did not seriously detract from the film. The dialogue was excellent and the highlight with the exception of the aforementioned meeting was the ending. It seemed like Resnais had been waiting to get to the end of the film just so he could pull off some artiness but there is no doubt that it worked. The scene with the snow falling in the house partly reminiscent of Tarkovsky's Solaris was great as were the final moments showing every character in familiar yet distorted places to show their loneliness andor unhappiness. The basic final sequence has been done many times before but the way Resnais directed it put it in a class above the rest. As anyone would tell you endings can be crucial to a film and this film's ending was superb.One final comment  this was a case where I thought the English title was a lot better than the French one. 'Couers' which I believe from my limited knowledge of French means 'hearts' is a little dull compared to the English title of 'Private Fears in Public Places' which while perhaps not perfectly relevant to the film is still an excellent title all the same.".

The cold and snowing Paris is a kind of metaphor to the frustration in the relationship of the uptight characters that are afraid to deliver themselves to their passions. However the hype surrounding this movie increased my disappointment with the melancholic story. The characters are charismatic and likable and it is easy to the viewer to sympathize with them. Nevertheless the gorgeous Isabelle Carr is miscast in the role Galle since she is younger and younger than her brother and she is so beautiful that I can not understand how she does not succeed in her blind dates. There are good dialogs but the conclusion is too open and frustrating for a 120 minutes running time feature that gives the sensation of so what? to the viewer.

	schema:headline " Formally dazzling film with some great characters";
	schema:reviewBody "There are several reasons why I chose Coeurs as the first Alain Resnais film I would see chief among them that it seemed interesting and was one of his more acclaimed recent films and I didn't want to start with films of his that were probably influenced very heavily by the 'Nouveau Roman' writers he worked with including obviously Alain RobbeGrillet on Last Year at Marienbad and Marguerite Duras on Hiroshima mon amour. Also I find myself very interested in the works of artists who have lived longer than most of us will but are still working as there is frequently a sort of experience and wisdom there which fascinates me. Also it was pointed out to me by more than one person that a screenplay I had written with a friend before either of us had seen or even heard of Coeurs was conceptually similar and according to the one person who had read it had some plot similarities too. Naturally I wanted to see it for myself.Ultimately aside from the format which is quite similar in its moving frequently between different groups of characters for relatively short scenes there was only one striking similarity which I could detect in both screenplays two characters go on a blind date using fake names. Other than that my approach and thought process was almost entirely dissimilar to Resnais' and naturally although I'd love to say otherwise it is his which is more interesting. I call it Resnais' approach but the film is based on an English play and translatedadapted by JeanMichel Ribes so due credit to them as well obviously. Still I was impressed after hearing from more than one person about Resnais being a generally unintellectual commercial filmmaker with not only the film's formally dazzling structure look and editing but with the impressive restraint shown at every step. There's no showboating here and Resnais does absolutely nothing with the film that is not important somehow to the story and characters. His constant use of partitions the emphasized staginess of the film though not the acting as well as the dissolves linking each scene to the next are all crucial to the thematic content of the film.I initially met the film with some resistance. Some of the humor was too cute and it felt like light fluff to me initially. However much like numerous other films Coeurs eventually came together making the whole experience worthwhile. Ultimately the only things which truly bothered me were some intrusive clichs all of which were linked directly to the character Charlotte who really singlehandedly keeps the film from reaching true greatness. Any scenes with her feel like a waste compared to the dazzling scenes with the other characters. Well to be fair not every scene the stuff with Lionel is quite strong but certainly not the nonsense with his father which isn't funny nor dramatically strong. When you have a mosaiclike structure of this sort it's natural that some parts will be less interesting and it's up to the individual which parts are less interesting but my personal reaction to Charlotte and her relationship with Thierry was not even mild amusement but a severe disinterest. The film is oddly distant surely to emphasize the loneliness of these characters but it's also wonderfully warm most of the time and most of the characters are extremely welldrawn. Then you have a caricature who is never truly explored to significantly lessen the quality of the film. It's just plain disappointing.A very interesting film certainly a formally excellent one but I was disappointed in the lesser sections of it. Still it gets a strong recommendation from me due to Resnais' direction thanks to the truly superb acting and obviously the parts of the film which is the majority of it which didn't get on my nerves. It's just frustrating that it falls just short of greatness. Also I think I'm in love with Gaelle now not the actress the character.".

	schema:reviewBody "Coeurs is Alain Resnais 16th feature which he made at the age of 84. This film proved that Alain Resnais still has the same master within he had in the 1960's. His brilliance and imagination sure didn't stop at Coeurs which he proved in 2009 by making Les herbes folles Wild Grass and apparently he is once again making a new film. Alain Resnais has always worked with incredible writers such as Marquerita Duras and Henri Laborit and this time his film is based on an English play 'Private Fears in Public Places' by Alan Ayckbourn. Coeurs is no blind visualization of an alreadytold story but an insightful look at the world of today relationships modern society and the conventional genre of romantic comedy.There is something incredibly sweet and beautiful in this simple storyline which at first sight might seem conventional and stereotypical with regards to romantic comedy. But the way Resnais builds dramaturgy is anything but conventional as we move from brief scene to another and observe the situations where the characters come across with each other. The themes of the film are common for the director  intimacy loneliness disappointment and getting old but new are the postmodern criticism for the mass culture of television and a superior way of dealing with the tragicomic fantasies of his characters.Coeurs features three of Resnais' standard actors Sabine Azma Andr Dussollier and Pierre Arditi but newcomers in the world of Alain Resnais are an Italian actress Laura Morante and a French woman Isabelle Carr. Dussollier plays a bitter realestate agent Thierry who has a dynamic fundamental Christian colleague Charlotte Sabine Azma. Lionel Pierre Arditi is a slightly frustrated bartender who listens to the worries of Dan Lambert Wilson whose relationship isn't going so well with Nicole Laura Morante who tries to find a perfect home for her and Dan. Galle Isabelle Carr is Thierry's sister who desperately tries to find a date and eventually becomes acquainted with Dan.The film has six protagonists and it wraps around certain threads of blind chance that seem to pull the characters together. It's a film about six people who come across with each other without really meeting or knowing each other. Each scene features a situation between two characters and we are quickly thrown from one situation to another but still never lose our track of what is going on. I think Resnais has found new emotional scales in Coeurs which he didn't have before in his political films 1960's nor in his philosophical films 1980's. The viewer actually cares and has sympathy for the characters portrayed  which is too rare these days. I love and prefer the earlier films by Resnais so I mean no disrespect for them. This elegant story about six people remind the viewer of Resnais' classic Last Year at Marienbad 1961 and a bunch of other films by him for example Mon oncle d'Amrique 1980  where there is a certain ensemble of protagonists.Coeurs is a very Resnaisian film in all its histrionics. The film is entirely filmed in a setting that is clearly a studio. For instance there are no roofs which is shown to the viewer in bird perspective shots. In the realestate office there are movable glass walls and we see that the characters don't notice it but the camera shows it to us  fiction knows that it's fiction the movie admits that it is only a movie. Strong pastel shades also characterize Coeurs  pink orange and white walls and lights.The characters make different interpretations of the same theme of sad melancholy life and the inability of man to see. The span of these themes is incredibly wide from tragic Lionel and his cruel father to pathetic Thierry and Galle. Snow is the most surreal Resnaisian element of the film. Throughout the film it snows  everywhere. Resnais had already used snow flakes in L'Amour a Mort where he wanted to tell about life death and hereafter. But in Coeurs the snow represents a wintry state of mind and the benumbed emotional lives of the characters.".

Throughout the film it snows  everywhere. Resnais had already used snow flakes in L'Amour a Mort where he wanted to tell about life death and hereafter. But in Coeurs the snow represents a wintry state of mind and the benumbed emotional lives of the characters.";

	schema:reviewBody "Alexander Kluge's Artisten unter der Zirkuskuppel ratlos has often been criticized as inaccessible. I've heard that at the time of the film's first release some cinemas allowed viewers to see the film twice while having them pay for only one ticket acknowledging that more than one viewing was needed to digest this complex film. Clearly the film's montage technique and its use of quotes from Hegel Nietzsche and others in often rather rapid succession doesn't help and may leave some viewers almost as clueless ratlos as the artists of the title. I've nevertheless experienced the film as a deeply moving attempt to deal with the question of the role of art in the face of historical catastrophe  the question of how art after Auschwitz is possible as asked by Theodor Adorno and other intellectuals and artists in postwar Germany.Ironically Leni Peickert the film's hopeful circus director and her production team is confronted with the same questions Kluge may have asked himself before making the film. After having solved the problem of producing art for the market which had caused the first artistic setback a deus ex machina solution all of a sudden provides Leni Peickert with money the team is pondering difficult artistic questions. Should we try to reach a mass audience popularize and simplify matters? Should the circus produce politically engaged tendential art  our would this reduce the issues at hand to mere slogans?That the circus is a standin for artistic production in general becomes clear when Leni Peickert and her team visit a writer's congress that triggers off a discussion of can there be art after Auschwitz resonating with Adorno's statement that writing poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric. Rather than endorsing this discussion however the film appears to exhibit its sterility and formulaic quality.The film's insistence on catastrophe violent historical upheaval and failed revolution through its use of historical footage implicitly makes a claim for the task art has to take on. Kluge's film begins with the recent past many Germans of the sixties wanted to forget a hilarious documentary sequence of a festival of art staged by the Nazis and featuring extras wearing unhistorical ancient Germanic costumes. The soundtrack ironically underlays this with an Italian version of Paul McCartney's song Yesterday. Against this yesterday against Nazi art with its blind celebration of a presumably glorious Germanic past Kluge's film critically reflects on the role of art in postwar German society.Most memorable are perhaps the scenes with the elephants  the animals that never forget. At one point scenes of circus elephants filmed by Kluge are cut with historical photos while Kluge's voice tells of elephants who died in a sensational fire in a zoo. We won't forget the elephants say and Kluge's voiceover mysteriously tells of a pain that had to be locked up in crates and submerged in the ocean the experience of trauma that can neither be dealt with and faced nor forgotten. Kluge's film is a plea for an art that enables us to work with historical trauma and to transform it into artistic production and political action. Unfortunately his film was not like for instance his earlier movie Abschied von Gestern Yesterday Girl a success with audiences but it remains a moving and intellectually engaging contribution to the discussion of the role of art in postwar Germany. Unfortunately to my knowledge Kluge's films are not generally available on video.".

It often exhibits a genuine empathy for the core tenets and consequent outward trappings of Catholicism. As a general examination of the Catholic faith it's accurate and probing capturing the unavoidable selfishness and vanity of us all even in the face of our own attempts at generosity or even piety.Yet I liked this film more because the omnipresent core of Catholicism recedes as subject. Quietly but surely the individuals become the focus of the film. Of course at the centre is Sylvie Testud's Christine a marvellous performance in which intellect and emotion is in perpetual discreet motion  but there's no selfpity and apart from a rather dislocated intonation of standard liturgical incantations no mention of God. Christine doesn't reject the theme park of piety revolving about her but she seems to find it a focus for a personal confrontation with her affliction. Key to the offsetting of this is a performance of equal discretion and focus that of the genuinely pious but equally worldly Gilette Barbier as Frau Hartl with whom Christine shares a room. The other satellite roles are all welltaken I did like that La Seydoux never overdid her turn as the immature nurse assigned to Christine.A well designed and paced film Lourdes also has a moments of wit. It not only examines the nature of devotion but does so in the appositely Christian context of an interesting yarn. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "Austrian screenwriter and director Jessica Hausner's third feature film film which she wrote premiered In competition at the 66th Venice Film Festival in 2009 was screened in the Contemporary World Cinema section at the 34th Toronto International Film Festival in 2009 was shot on location in France and is a FranceGermanyAustria coproduction which was produced by producers Martin Gschlacht Philippe Bober and Suzanne Marian. It tells the story about a young woman with Multiple Sclerosis named Christine. She is chained to a wheelchair and can only get out if she signs up for cultural or Christian trips. Christine has previously visited Rome but her next destination is Lourdes the iconic site of pilgrimage in the Pyrenees Mountains.This finely tuned fictional tale is set in the Christian pilgrimage town Lourdes in France a fine choice of location where the Virgin Mary apparently appeared to a 14yearold girl named Bernadette Soubirous in 1858 and Austrian filmmaker Jessica Hausner tells the story about a reserved though smiling and obliging woman who arrives at Lourdes hoping to be cured of her chronic illness. Jessica Hausner's quiet reflection of the intangibility concerning miracles and peoples individual relations to their faith is intellectually debated and asks several interesting questions that are also answered. All though her film has elements of divinity by it in the use of music and some remarkable scenes it is by no means an overly religious film. Lourdes is rather a concentrated study of an enigmatic theme and a film where the characters reactions and reception to the abstract is the core and where the existential converges with the mysterious and the distinct with the abstract.Austrian cinematographer Martin Gschlacht's skillful and structural cinematography compliments Jessica Hausner's clear vision and her steady stringent and partly static direction is at its best when she films the main character from versatile perspectives and creates describing portraits of an archetype character excellently played by French actress screenwriter and director Sylvie Testud in a vital and radiating interpretation of a character that only has her face and her words to express herself with.

	onyx:emotionText "Austrian screenwriter and director Jessica Hausner's third feature film film which she wrote premiered In competition at the 66th Venice Film Festival in 2009 was screened in the Contemporary World Cinema section at the 34th Toronto International Film Festival in 2009 was shot on location in France and is a FranceGermanyAustria coproduction which was produced by producers Martin Gschlacht Philippe Bober and Suzanne Marian. It tells the story about a young woman with Multiple Sclerosis named Christine. She is chained to a wheelchair and can only get out if she signs up for cultural or Christian trips. Christine has previously visited Rome but her next destination is Lourdes the iconic site of pilgrimage in the Pyrenees Mountains.This finely tuned fictional tale is set in the Christian pilgrimage town Lourdes in France a fine choice of location where the Virgin Mary apparently appeared to a 14yearold girl named Bernadette Soubirous in 1858 and Austrian filmmaker Jessica Hausner tells the story about a reserved though smiling and obliging woman who arrives at Lourdes hoping to be cured of her chronic illness. Jessica Hausner's quiet reflection of the intangibility concerning miracles and peoples individual relations to their faith is intellectually debated and asks several interesting questions that are also answered. All though her film has elements of divinity by it in the use of music and some remarkable scenes it is by no means an overly religious film. Lourdes is rather a concentrated study of an enigmatic theme and a film where the characters reactions and reception to the abstract is the core and where the existential converges with the mysterious and the distinct with the abstract.Austrian cinematographer Martin Gschlacht's skillful and structural cinematography compliments Jessica Hausner's clear vision and her steady stringent and partly static direction is at its best when she films the main character from versatile perspectives and creates describing portraits of an archetype character excellently played by French actress screenwriter and director Sylvie Testud in a vital and radiating interpretation of a character that only has her face and her words to express herself with. Most actors delivers convincing acting and Jessica Hausner's film has a strong humane warmth that shines through the heroine's being and an elusive atmosphere which is effectuated by the esoteric faces of the guests and employees at the place that has been called the Catholic Church's answer to Disneyland. An innovating and artistic film from a director with a recognizable personal style where one is left feeling like having seen something that lasted significantly longer than its running time.";

She travels to the pilgrimage site of Lourdes in the Pyrenees Mountains to both escape from her isolation and seek some kind of answers to her situation. Compared to the other pilgrims Christine has little faith in God. Yet while she's there she miraculously gains controls of her limbs and she rises from her wheelchair. The church are quick to jump on it as a 'miracle' but seek medical advice in order to confirm this.The film never takes a stance in regards to its attitude to either religion or spirituality to the point where the 'miracle' that takes place takes a backseat. This is a film that is more concerned with its characters' plight and how the people around Christine react to the possible miracle that they witness. It does if anything portray the Catholic faith in a positive light. The priest seeks all the medical advice he can get before he will believe it as a miracle and the helpers at Lourdes minus one rather selfinvolved girl are shown to have genuine love for the work they do and its importance. But it does also show the slightly ridiculous side as the Church will only recognise it as an 'official' miracle if it ticks certain boxes.it does not linger on the idea of faith as previously stated but instead how it corrupts bewilders and enchants the people around Christine. Some of the pilgrims talk bitterly between themselves and doubt her sincerity to the point where they begin to dismiss the idea of miracles which is the very thing that they went to Lourdes to experience. One of the male helpers initially shows an interest in Christine glancing and smiling at her every now and then. Yet when she begins to walk again he seems to almost completely fall for her much to the jealousy of one of the female workers. It's a startling commentary on how humanity can be corrupted and influenced by the idea of religion.Lourdes is a quiet gentle and ponderous portrayal of a woman desperately seeking an answer to her illness and finding it in the last place she would expect. It doesn't force its ideas down your throat but instead it lets it flow across the small interactions and expressions of its characters. The pace may sometimes come to a standstill but this is a richly rewarding experience from one of Austria's most exciting new directors.www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com".

The wheelchair bound Mr. Hruby and the mother of another disabled girl react with an uncomfortable but natural jealousy to the miracle. And we then get to the matter of faith for all the cynicism that surrounds Lourdes and the touristy nature of it which is undisputed the open displays of faith and the essence of hope cannot be underestimated. I found the scenes focusing on faith very moving for all the criticism of particularly the Catholic church of late one cannot dispute or try and detract from the faith of those who believe. This was the heart of the film for me. Although one could say that it is almost a parody of Lourdes and all it stands for the faith of those who make the pilgrimages there cannot be disputed. The film raised these questions without ever offering answers for such difficult and essential subjects that is all it can ever do. It certainly made me ask questions of myself which is exactly what a film should do.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am Roman Catholic. Lourdes is a blessed mystical place. I hear. The story goes the Virgin Mary appeared to St. Bernadette in a grotto near Lourdes several times. Word spread a shrine was built miracles occurred all in this small community in the south of France. Now millions travel to Lourdes every year looking for intervention from St. Bernadette and the Blessed Mother. While I've never been there I have been to shrines like Saint Joseph's Oratory of MountRoyal in Montreal. The relics for sale and presence of the pilgrims are a little scary but there was no denying the power of the place. So I was very interested to see a pilgrimage from the perspective of a pilgrim in Lourdes a movie playing at the Cleveland International Film Festival this week. Christine is a young woman from France who has multiple sclerosis. She's lost control of her body from the neck down. But her mind is vibrant she seems to accept the help of nurse volunteers at Lourdes with a pleasant demeanor. She tells a priest in confession that she gets angry over her diagnosis and feels envious of able bodied people like a nurse who is flirting with a man on the trip that she fancies. This is like a group tour with a different activity each day a hike through the grotto a bath in the water even an award at the end of the trip for the Best Pilgrim. Christine's mother is with her on the trip. Their relationship is one of the things that bothered me in the movie. While her mother accepts the role of caregiver they barely talk or interact except in a very distant fashion. I didn't get that. A couple of the older volunteers hang together at night and discuss deep topics of faith and spirituality. Juxtapose that with Christine confessing to her nurse that she is not really a believer she just goes on the pilgrimages because she can't really get out of the house for much else. When the inevitable miracle occurs within the group some are jealous others are skeptical others just wonder why some are chosen and others are not. Lourdes is a very quiet very slow moving film. I guess I was hoping for more of an epiphany but at the end I wasn't at all sure what I was supposed to take away from it. I was interested but not satisfied. I give Lourdes a 7 out of 10.".

But it was made in 2009 and the world has moved on in some respects at least. I live a couple of hours from Lourdes and people here in France simply don't talk and act as repressed any more as they do in the movie. The dialogue was incredibly stilted and full of clichs as were the characterisations. Some people write that the movie comments on life and religion on many subtle ways. Other than showcasing once again the cruelty and incompetence of the Christian mindset towards those that suffer I didn't see any deep meanings subtlety or anything illuminating making it worthwhile sitting through all this. I mean do we really have to listen again to people discussing that hoary old chestnut of how God can be all powerful and all good yet allows suffering in the world? Or the man walking away from the girl after she falls how much more clichd can you get? The film clearly is made with honesty and integrity but sadly with a great lack of originality. It looks as if Hausner tried to make a film in the tradition of social realism which is fair enough but it's far inferior to many other movies in the genre and her approach really is forty years out of date.".

One person brought that people wouldn't be violent on the day when the world ends but come together in a type of philosophical togetherness.  I was stunned by that idea assuming that the cynicism that permeates today's culture would have enforced that idea that violence will be around.  The end of the world is a violent thought as exemplified in films such as Armageddon and Deep Impact true they were stupid films. But that aside Last Night is a powerful and very introspective look at the lives of several people who's lives happen to be interwoven on the last day of the world.  It begs the question what would you do with the final six hours.  Many have remarked on the tone and I have to heap more praise on the subtle irony that is found throughout the film.  Why is the world ending?  The audience doesn't find out.  Whether one's appreciation of the film diminishes or grows for this ambitious step is purely personal.  For a ninety minute film it's ambition in depicting six lives is interesting and it's only mistake.  For the movie to do justice to all the characters it needed to be at least half an hour longer.  But that singular flaw does not negate the film's final achievement.  The entire cast is sensational even if they're on for short periods of time.  Rennie and Oh took home well deserved Genie awards for their brilliant performances but I felt McKellar's performance was the most intriguing.  He has a talent for not poignant drama but scenes of almost deadpantype comedy where Sandra asks him the favour.  Don McKellar has got to be among the most versatile writers around.  After writing ThirtyTwo Short Films About Glenn Gould the fragmented biopic about the famous pianist and The Red Violin another slightly fragmented story told through and about a violin he wrote directed and starred in Last Night and apocalyptic dramedy or an ironic tragicomedy and he does it with supreme style.  Last Night is a film not to be missed but to be pondered over and savoured.".

However because of the fact that the film saw limited release in arthouse theatres across the country and is just appearing on video now chances are good that Last Night will not be seen by a large majority of the public if not sent in to full release across the United States.This movie is Canadian  without shoving the fact that it is down your throat.Now on to the actual guts of the movie.  I find the understatement of the fact that the world IS ending in six short hours to be so uniquely Canadian. There is an odd somewhat macabre scene in the movie where McKellar's character is being harassed by his mother for showing up late for Christmas dinner.  Not once does mother mention the end of the world.  McKellar's response?  ... and in case you haven't noticed the world is going to end today and I've had a lot on my mind.Getting off my maple leaf wavinghighhorse I will say this  the performances by McKellar Sandra Oh and Callum Keith Rennie are nothing short of superb.  They portray characters you at times love hate and fear because there are times many times that we see ourselves in these characters.The soundtrack for Last Night available on the Sony Classical label is a mixture of both the corniest music on the face of the earth Burton Cummings' live performance of Glamour Boy to great oldies Last Night I Didn't Get to Sleep at All to songs few if any people have ever heard before i.e. the Defranco Family's Heartbeat its a LovebeatThe story moves at a graceful pace there are no surprise endings and the characters are humane.

McKellar's response?  ... and in case you haven't noticed the world is going to end today and I've had a lot on my mind.Getting off my maple leaf wavinghighhorse I will say this  the performances by McKellar Sandra Oh and Callum Keith Rennie are nothing short of superb.  They portray characters you at times love hate and fear because there are times many times that we see ourselves in these characters.The soundtrack for Last Night available on the Sony Classical label is a mixture of both the corniest music on the face of the earth Burton Cummings' live performance of Glamour Boy to great oldies Last Night I Didn't Get to Sleep at All to songs few if any people have ever heard before i.e. the Defranco Family's Heartbeat its a LovebeatThe story moves at a graceful pace there are no surprise endings and the characters are humane.  Last Night is a masterpiece.";

There's always something about each work that bugs me a bit but like the bit of gravel in your hiking boots that makes the trek that little bit more memorable that little bit more real I always wonder would I really have been happier without it?Last Night  a subtle oddly serene film about the world ending not quite with a bang not quite with a whimper  but with a gently rueful and very human shrug  is typical in this regard. I more than merely like this film  I believe I'd put it among my top ten favourite works and I've seen a lot of movies  but as a matter of honesty I have to warn anyone who hasn't seen it yet it does have more than a few rough edges.The acting's a bit uneven and ranges from borderline painful to actually stunning I find the occasionally hysterical mother played by Roberta Maxwell painfully cliched. Bujold on the other hand you just have to see. Oh is memorable surprisingly powerful. McMullen I still can't make my mind up about. McKellar is well McKellar. I can't help liking the character even if it does seem a manipulative kinda setup that makes it so.The script does amble a bit. It's kinda the nature of the story. And McKellar's fondness for clever throwaway lines sometimes gets the best of him in my view both in his own part and in McMullen's.But these are minor flaws forgivable or as above perhaps necessary in an otherwise actually brilliant piece of work.And overall the writing I have to say is the best I've seen from McKellar yet. This a very delicately balanced script marvelously restrained. Somehow McKellar has made a movie in which regret euphoria and dread circle each other warily for an hour and a half without melodrama once rising up out of the mix. There are believable moments of hysteria they generally punctuate the prevailing current of reflection resignation and quiet desperation entirely believably and appropriately.The ending... I'm not breathing a word about the ending.Apart from this it's flawless.My vote see it.".

An appropriate choice as the film showcases many scenes in the streets of Toronto. It's always a small thrill when watching a film that was shot on the street where you work or somewhere familiar.The reception for the film was extremely positive but I guess it's fair to say that the audience was fairly biased. Nevertheless it portrayed with equal amounts of seriousness and black humour the nature of humanity as it might act in the last hours of civilization as we know it. No fanfare no 'splosions  lasers no asteroids plummeting from the sky no glossy veneer in essence a breath of fresh air.Part of what made Armageddon so unbearable to sit through was it's choppy editing and utter refusal to sit in one place for a moment and see how events affected those involved. The filmmakers were more interested in the number of action sequences rather than focusing on the story. Quite simply compared to Last Night Armageddon just seems like a multimillion dollar joke of a movie. I'm sure all those involved in it were amply compensated financially but at what cost to their credibility?Deep Impact another endoftheworld epic on the other hand had a far stronger story element whose only weakness can be found in the contrived youthful love story that defies interest on many levels. To its credit Deep Impact features Morgan Freeman who is a stunningly gifted actor who brings depth and credibility to everything I've seen him in. But Deep Impact is in it's heart another action flick and therefore not in the same category as Last Night.Last Night dares to delve into areas of the human psyche that neither of the other two films explore Denial. Insanity. Lust. Loneliness. Suicidal tendencies. Embracing nihilistic impulses. Utter chaos. Depression. Compulsion. You know the finer things in life the magic stuff of huge box office receipts. I guess it's fair to say that this film is not an upbeat life affirming experience that is geared towards everyone.Last Night tackles an age old prophecy the end of mankind with an entirely fresh and innovative approach. It doesn't treat the viewer like a child that needs to have everything explained in detail. It really doesn't matter why or how the world is ending when nothing can be done about it anymore now does it? The film's fade to white at the end stands as a perfect example of the ingenuity exercised.Without question this film is more thought provoking and engaging than either of the other two aforementioned efforts. Given it's low budget and Canadian affiliation it's also unlikely to reach the kind of audience that Deep Impact and Armageddon enjoyed on their opening weekends. You've really got to hunt for the gems sometimes.".

Not since On The Beach has this genre shown us the dignity stubbornness compassion and yes sometimes rage that humans are capable of when faced with their own mortality. The fact that in this film it's happening to EVERYONE makes the imminent loss of life as well as the ending of the movie itself all the more affecting.

This is also the first time I've ever seen a movie end by fading to white and it was an excellent idea for an ending.I think the only weakness if it qualifies as a weakness is the wasting of Sarah Polley. I felt the film could have spent a little more time with Jennifer and her boyfriend. Sarah Polley is the kind of actor who can take an insignificant character and make her into something more.Other than that the performances were excellent all around. McKellar did a great job. When actors direct the films they're starring in they're usually pretty weak. If you didn't know he was the director you never would have guessed it. If Mr. McKellar makes a film half this good the next time he directs he might get a chance to thank the Academy that is if there is any justice.One final note I don't think I've ever thought this much after watching a film. Obviously everyone who sees this movie will be asking themselves what they would be doing on the last night.

We had hoped in vain as it turns out that we would learn some context as to whyhow the world was about to predictably end cleanly right at midnight one day.  When we left shortly after we got caught up it was a relief for me to leave behind this depressing and unbelievable film literally a welcome breath of fresh air.The plot is simple  for some unknown reason the whole world or at least all humans will come to an end at midnight and if you listen carefully for just a few offhand and quick lines in dialogue you will also note that this has been known for a few months and that night hasn't fallen in some time how could this be?  Has the earth suddenly stopped rotating?  Would India be in total darkness if Canada is in total light?  Is the Western Hemisphere coming to an end??  Have people really given up? Who knows..  What would you do if you knew for a fact that the world were about to end?  And had a few months to prepare for it?You have to abandon your credulity even further as the characters portrayed are largely 2dimensional and whose motives and actions make little sense. Some may choose quite contemplation a few of the characters pray some may go mad as one mother seems to have some may review their lives as a family does but is human character so evil and interested in senseless entropy as to engage in pointless violence and property damage crass behavior and the like?  I would think not  I would think that such a calamity would tend to make people introspective and to commiserate and hang together as a global community.Philosophical perspective aside the characterization had no depth.  The camera techniques were mildly interesting often involving shooting into hazy light but the camera was not kind to the characters making most of them look unflattering.  How could this have been called a comedic drama? It was depressing throughandthrough and the drama was very weak with there being no attempt portrayed to understandovercome the demise  instead all is just a rather ineffective depiction of individual reactions to the impending doom.Rating 3 out of 10 though I'm wondering why I rated it so high  maybe because of some of the great songs from the 1970s for example I was delighted to hear Jimmy Loves Maryanne by Looking Glass of Brandy fame  I didn't know anybody knew this other song of theirs!".

'Mona Lisa' follows a basically good guy whose made some bad choices George Bob Hoskins and his return from prison. Shunned from his wife and some of his old buddies George feels kind of unwanted but gets a job from his old boss Michael Caine chauffeuring a call girl Cathy Tyson around at night. The call girl and George form a bond while the story turns into violence crime and George and the call girl's search for a young innocent teenage girl forced into prostitution. In my opinion 'Mona Lisa' is one of Jordan's best films if not his best. Hoskins is absolutely amazing in his role while Cathy Tyson and Michael Caine provide solid performances as well. Clarke Peters who you may know as Detective Freeman from HBO's brilliant dramatic series 'The Wire' is also in this as Cathy Tyson's evil and psychotic pimp. For all you indie fans out there rush to the Blockbuster near you to rent 'Mona Lisa' make sure it's not 'Mona Lisa Smile' that movie is a tad bit different. Most likely you'll find a lot to enjoy andor admire about this little British indie gem. Grade B".

He has just been released from prison after 7 years for taking the rap for a crime committed by local gangland boss Denny Mortwell Michael Caine. Caine soon gets George back on the payroll as an exclusive chauffeur for high class call girl Simone Cathy Tyson. But George helplessly falls for Simone and gets sucked into her secret agenda for trawling London's seedy underworld  mainly prostitution. The film is a masterpiece from director Neil Jordan  easily his best work to date and has never been bettered  and the cast benefit greatly from an impeccable script. Jordan's ear for dialogue is never more evident than here  especially in Geroge's conversations with his only true friend Thomas Robbie Coltrane. Anyone who thought Hoskins couldn't better his performance in The Long Good Friday in 1979 should take a look at this. He is simply astonishing and your eyes never leave a single scene he is in. But no review would be complete without paying tribute equally to the unearthed gem that is Cathy Tyson. Bearing in mind she was barely 20 when this movie was shot she is incredible opposite Hoskins and whilst she has had more of a TV career since it is surprising and perhaps a shame that she has never had perhaps the vehicle or opportunity to scale such heights again. However Kate Hardie is also deserving of special mention as a fellow hooker and her great portrayal in this movie has shamefully been totally overlooked over the years. Caine's cameo appearance is also menacingly good and he plays the seedy villain with chilling ease. Throw in the great location work around London's Soho and Brighton and a great tune from Genesis and you get a presentation every bit as high class as Tyson's Simone is meant to be.".

The two couldn't be more at odds but there's an incremental softening with Hoskins slowly becoming taken with her sophistication. But the film's terrific noir story finds our smalltime crook plunging himself into the murky waters of the London underworld as he tries to unravel a mystery. And in true hardboiled fashion he's had enough of being jerked around as events turn ever more downbeat. There's a glimmer of hope in the closing moments of MONA LISA that happens just when you think things can't get any bleaker. It's not at all what one would expect but for once there's finally a note that's upbeat.Wonderful movie engrossing while it plays and hard to shake when it's done. The story is luridly captivating even when the seedy scenery isn't. And there's a nice break for a music video Genesis' In Too Deep that lays on the mood in the grand Miami Vice tradition. And the performances from Hoskins Tyson and Michael Caine who commands the screen during his scenes are remarkable. But it's Hoskins who makes this movie his own as a character who's usually clueless with an innocence masked by gritty toughness. We share his heartbreak when he's denied that which keeps him going and the film's emotional center is embodied by him. He really does an amazing job here. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "Mona Lisa is a moving and memorable combination of the British crime film and the character study produced by George Harrison's company Handmade Films and serves as a showcase for some very impressive performances. Top billed Bob Hoskins in particular in his Best Actor Academy Award nominated performance is the person we follow through a convincing depiction of the seamy underbelly of London a land populated by pimps prostitutes and mobsters such as the nasty Mortwell played by Michael Caine. Hoskins's George is a low level mob member getting out of prison after spending seven years there emerging into a world unfamiliar to him. He's given the initially thankless task of acting as chauffeur for high class prostitute Simone played by the lovely and amazing Cathy Tyson. But before very long they start warming up to each other and the balance of the movie charts their evolving relationship. Ultimately George decides to do Cathy a favour by finding a long lost acquaintance of hers but this leads to less than ideal circumstances for all involved. Director Neil Jordan who cowrote the screenplay with David Leland has created a compelling if deliberately paced drama that's much more character driven than action oriented although there are some brief bursts of violence here and there. The film also has quite the sense of humour at times much of it coming from the engaging Robbie Coltrane as George's good friend Thomas. Thomas likes to create art using plastic spaghetti ! and there is a nice light touch brought to all scenes with Hoskins and Coltrane which prevents this story from ever being too much of a downer although for the most part Mona Lisa is grim and gritty stuff with fairy tale and film noir elements emphasized. By the end George realizes how much he's been manipulated by his femme fatale Simone. Jordan completely pulls us into this vivid environment and gets nice supporting performances from Kate Hardie as Cathy Zoe Nathenson as Jeannie and Sammi Davis as May as well as a sufficiently slimy portrayal by Clarke Peters 'The Wire' as vicious pimp Anderson. Trivia note look for Kenny Baker always to be best known as R2D2 in the Star Wars franchise as a boardwalk busker. Fine music by Michael Kamen is a plus as well as soundtrack selections including Nat King Cole's performances of When I Fall in Love and the title tune. Worth seeing for fans of the crime film and of the cast  crew Mona Lisa is potent entertainment. Eight out of 10.".

Like The Crying Game I was left with no immediate impression of the movie but days after watching it I became haunted by the film's ingratiating reality.  You can tell you're watching a good movie when you can describe it as atmospheric without the film trying overtly to reach for that effect.Bob Hoskins stars as George and as we first see him he is lulling along a dismal London apartment neighborhood with a plastic bag and a fistful of flowers.  As he reaches his destination the audience soon realizes what a heartbroken journey this man's life has been.  Indeed his good intentions at seeing his wife and daughter are mired by the wife's stubborn yet understandable reaction of slamming the door in her exconvict husband's face.Soon George is hired by the callous gangster Mortwell Michael Caine as a chauffeur for the highclass call girl Simone Cathy Tyson.  He is at first repelled by the tall black tart as she remarks about his slovenly appearance.  In a subplot structured like a revisionist feminine Pygmalion George is made over by the prostitute into the appearance of a gentleman a contempestuous appearance which only magnifies his goodhearted nature in comparison with the coldblooded Mortwell.Soon however George and Simone strike a bond seemingly based on a mutual affection for the souls lurking beneath each facade.  Simone details to George an old blonde friend named Cathy still working the streets and implores him to rescue her.  Jordan builds upon the elements of Taxi Driver here and even pays homage to that film in one scene depicting the front end of George's automobile backlit by a seedy district filled with peep shows and pedophiles.Of course George is starting to fall for his elegant charge but his feelings are more of a fatherly nature than anything. Simone seems to feed off this affection as she states that she does no more than drink tea at the behest of her clients and even provides snapshots of her doing so.  This is why it comes as even more of a shock to George when he accidentally discovers a porn video featuring Simone at the provocation of things which her innocent demeanor had previously rendered him incapable of imagining.Much of Mona Lisa is built around human desperation and indeed one can sense that George like Travis Bickle or Jimmy Stewart in Vertigo is attempting to erroneously place the puzzledtogether image of the perfect woman into the jagged emotional contours of his love interest.  Of course the title implies this and Jordan reinforces this symbolization with not only the Da Vinci painting and the Nat King Cole ballad but with the incandescent statues of the Virgin Mary which his friend Robbie Coltrane collects.  This is unarguably Hoskins' best performance in a career entirely overlooked by even the most driven of film fanatics. After roles in The Long Good Friday Pink Floyd The Wall this Who Framed Roger Rabbit and the upcoming Felicia's Journey one can deduce the sheer emotional vicissitude which compelled him to aim for let alone attain the raw power that comprises his characters.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bob Hoskins made two widely popular movies in the 1980s and this was one of them. Having seen the other The Long Good Friday I wasn't expecting too much but was pleasantly surprised. Hoskins just out of the slams is hired to drive a highend black hooker Cathy Tyson from one wealthy client to another. He grows to care for her and when she asks him for a favor find a strungout young girl named Kathy a former roomie of hers he agrees. He searches the seedier places of London until he finally digs her up. She very young and very hooked. Robbie Coltrane is Hoskins' friend and Michael Caine is a sort of procurer. The ending is both distressing and violent  distressing because some of these characters are fully fleshed and we feel we've come to know them. The film is quite nicely done. The score makes much use of Nat King Cole's ballad Mona Lisa evoking mystery and it's appropriate. The composer has worked what seem to be endless variations of the first four notes of the theme into the score. We hear it in the background often in minor key or played exclusively on double bass or burnished by horns. Those four notes insinuate themselves into the incidental music so often that a listener loses the sense that they are the introduction to a pop song and they come to have an ominous functional autonomy disembodied from the simple tune that prompted it. They become their own song.The acting is fine. Bob Hoskins is an essentially moral guy short and unprepossesing who first shows up on screen wearing an echt1970s bellbottomed leisure suit he's been in for seven years remember and carrying a bouqet of flowers that his wife berserk with anger tells him what to do with. His gradual attraction to his passenger is nicely laid out as are the reasons for his occasional displays of violence. He's a sensitive guy but not too thoughtful. A lot of things get by him. But to be fair they get by the viewer too.There's an element of humor running through the film mostly expressed in the relationship between Hoskins and Coltrane who plays a writer and a sculptor of things made of plastic spaghetti. The Japanese have cornered the market. The dialogue is pretty funny in a lowkey way. Hoskins and Coltrane sit watching TV and Hoskins remarks something like Remember that guy who was murdered? Well I did it. Coltrane You're not joking? Hoskins turning and staring grimly I  never  joke. Coltrane You used to tell that one about the randy gorilla. And here is Hoskins describing his passenger telling Coltrane that she's not out to exploit him Hoskins because she's a lady. Coltrane A lady? I thought you said she was a tart. Hoskins Well  she is but she's a f lady too. And Cathy Tyson almost beggars description tall slender lithe not staggeringly beautiful or sexy but her appeal extends far beyond mere appearance. She's gorgeous in the most personal way. She tends to keep her face down and her eyes lowered almost demurely and her voice is soft and low just above a whisper although you never have to strain to hear what she's saying because her pronunciation is modulated and precise. It's soothing in control and at the same time reassuring the voice of an announcer on a latenight FM station playing nothing but classical music. You could listen to her for hours. You could look at her for hours too for that matter. Michael Caine doesn't have a big or showy part but he's so reliable that he's always a pleasure to see on screen. I can't think of a single film that has been damaged by his presence although he's been in a few bummers. The photography is perceptive. We get a good deal of local color not only from the London locations but from the seaside where everything comes to a head. There isn't a lot of violence. What there is of it is quick and pointed. See it if you get the chance.".

Well I did it. Coltrane You're not joking? Hoskins turning and staring grimly I  never  joke. Coltrane You used to tell that one about the randy gorilla. And here is Hoskins describing his passenger telling Coltrane that she's not out to exploit him Hoskins because she's a lady. Coltrane A lady? I thought you said she was a tart. Hoskins Well  she is but she's a f lady too. And Cathy Tyson almost beggars description tall slender lithe not staggeringly beautiful or sexy but her appeal extends far beyond mere appearance. She's gorgeous in the most personal way. She tends to keep her face down and her eyes lowered almost demurely and her voice is soft and low just above a whisper although you never have to strain to hear what she's saying because her pronunciation is modulated and precise. It's soothing in control and at the same time reassuring the voice of an announcer on a latenight FM station playing nothing but classical music. You could listen to her for hours. You could look at her for hours too for that matter. Michael Caine doesn't have a big or showy part but he's so reliable that he's always a pleasure to see on screen. I can't think of a single film that has been damaged by his presence although he's been in a few bummers. The photography is perceptive. We get a good deal of local color not only from the London locations but from the seaside where everything comes to a head. There isn't a lot of violence. What there is of it is quick and pointed. See it if you get the chance.";

Filling in a similar role as an excon looking for work in 1980s London I found his relationship with a callgirl to be highly effective in the character's exploration of a world he is simultaneously out of touch but all too familiar with. It is a story that moves along leisurely as he is soon employed by his employer's worker to find a vulnerable young girl on the streets and it is here that the film offers a disparaging outlook on urban prostitution through the annals of both high and low society. Hoskin's character becomes embroiled in an emotional investment beyond his control and like any Noir protagonist is very soon out of his league and receiving the short end of the stick.The ending revelation is effective but slightly underwhelming when one realizes that his journey was doomed from the beginning but this kind of set up is to be expected from these sorts of tales. The character development and progression between lead actor and actress is simple but highly effective.The cinematography comes across as drab sometimes but there are many beautiful moments in this film with some detailed choreography and impressive lighting of seedy smoke filled interiors as Hoskins navigates the Londonian labyrinths. The ending does feel slightly rushed but there are so many great moments and the film has a lot of untold backstory that gives its characters a lot of depth and very realistic insight into human longing. This is a great example of effective exposition that is relayed naturally and not a distraction or disservice to the film. A few choppy moments but overall 'Mona Lisa' is more than the sum of its parts and is an entertaining and atmospheric indie flick from Neil Jordan.".

They develop a working relationship of trust and soon Hoskins is asked to track down a missing girl. Hoskins is so perfect in this role. You can easily see him as a gruff and mean gangster but he adds a vulnerability which serves the romantic angle so well. He also has an endearing childlike naivety. Hoskins has great chemistry with everyone from Michael Caines villainous Mortwell to his conversations about crime novels with Robbie Coltrane. The soundtrack is ace with the opening and closing lyrics to Mona Lisa being all about interpretation which this film certainly asks you to find your own. Director Neil Jordan litters scenes with which allude to fantasy stories a white rabbit here performing dwarfs there etc. The dialogue is funny the relationships emotional and the themes disturbing. It's the full package and almost unique in its tone.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was completely blown away and amazed at how brilliant this film is and how underrated it's become since it came out. The title is based on the Nat King Cole song Mona Lisa which he sings about the famous Da Vinci painting and the mystery that surrounds it  and film revokes around that same painful mystery of a what a certain woman wants and what she has experienced.The film opens with that song with the male lead character George walking to his daughter's house after his release from prison. Looking for work as a chauffeur for his gangster boss he is appointed to a high class sophisticated black prostitute Simone to drive her around. She is annoyed at first by his appearance but slowly begins to trust him fitting him into new clothes. But as soon as she has faith in him she eventually drags him in to a dangerous pursuit and rescue of a young girl forced into prostitution. Led into the underworld of porn sleaze clubs and street mayhem George who unfortunately falls for Simone questions whether his job is worth it or not and will he or Simone could survive it. One of the many themes of this movie is the unrequited love of Simone a beautiful hooker who cannot be possessed that George develops and the difficult subject of underage forced prostitution and sadism. Bob Hoskins shines at the top of his acting game as George showing both fierceness as well as sensitivity to the role making it a perfect match and a well deserved Oscar nominated portrayal. Cathy Tyson was also perfect as the Mona Lisa  like Simone and Michael Caine appears as the ruthless king pin Mortwell.Adding to the mix is the great music the theme song by Genesis and the dark atmospheric look of London's night spots. All this made me want to see the film again and again thinking about something different that I saw in it each time. In my opinion the key to a good movie is wanting to see it again right after it finishes. It's just too bad Hoskins didn't win the Oscar and Cathy Tyson disappeared without a trace over the years. Although it's sometimes bleak it's a gorgeous piece of art just like the painting.".

Although based in London it could be any major city.Bob Hoskins heads a cast that never put a foot wrong. He's a stooge a schmoll a muggins. Fresh out of jail after a 7year stretch during which time he has done the honourable thing and kept schtum he is naturally seeking some payback. But his paymaster played by a wonderfully sleazy Micheal Caine is giving nothing. Indeed he has all but forgotten him. In an oleaginous exchange Hoskins' simple character is talked into settling for no more compensation than a driving job. And even then he has to use his own car. It's a good oldfashioned villains' Jaguar 3.4 saloon. He is driving a highend whore played by Cathy Tyson. Hers are a wealthy clientele to which she has worked her ticket from the street. Hoskins' character is a combination of tough worldly workingclass and at the same time untutored in good taste or the complex subtleties of human nature. His best mate is a strange character played by Robbie Coltrane. He's a sort of DelBoy constantly looking for the latest big thing but apparently getting nowhere. We meet him living in a trailer. He provides a cushion of levity which I found implausible and out of kilter with the brutal frankness of the other issues. There are plenty of other characters who also earn their cameo paycheques. But this is Hoskins' movie. His realisation of a simple eastend crook struggling to grasp the larger issues of the plot is an absolute tourdeforce. He is at once tough and vulnerable ruthless and humane smart and simple. And the shifting shades of personality and behaviour are absolutely seamless. He's a confessed murderer but you love him even so. He wouldn't 'top' anyone who didn't deserve it.There's so much to enjoy and admire in this movie that I could write all night but enough. It's flawed. Yet the story the shocks the camerawork and the topnotch acting set in the insidious stratum of human vice will stay with you long after.Very highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mona Lisa Neil Jordan 1986 is a fantastic piece of work a quiet touching love story framed against a sordid squalid London underworld full of underage prostitutes drug addicts and pitiless gangsters. Bob Hoskins is magnificent as a former mob driver and Nat 'King' Cole fan who gets out after seven years in stir and seeks a helping hand from his old bosses. What he gets is a job ferrying around high class call girl Cathy Tyson with whom he falls in love. So perhaps he's not thinking straight when he agrees to track down a friend the tall black tart promised to look out for years before taking him deep into the sordid squalid underbelly of the capital. Jordan establishes many of the concerns he'd conclusively nail in The Crying Game  unlikely friendships gameplaying and moral courage awoken within a lost soul by undaunted love  but his view is bleaker even nihilistic as the unconventional sweethearted hero struggles to breathe in an appalling stifling universe that's impossible for him to comprehend. Then gets royally screwed.The acting is universally superb though Hoskins is unquestionably the standout trading on his great gift the ability to transmit his very thoughts through that intelligently expressive fizzog. Tyson is also terrific while Caine is stunningly utilised in what's essentially a glorified cameo as a colourful rabbitloving crime lord. Jordan's script cowritten with future Wish You Were Here director David Leland is exceptional poetic funny quotable and frequently profane while his direction is laced with idiosyncratic leftfield touches. The film also casts its net a little wider than you might expect dealing with the artificiality of the '80s and the rise of consumerism through Robbie Coltrane's comic foil. He peddles fake spaghetti that goes like hot cakes and winds up apologising for his friend's language to a glowinthedark statue of the Virgin Mary that he thinks could be the next big thing. It's a nice offbeat subplot that offers solace from the grime though Mona Lisa's calling card remains the unforgettable love story at its centre which has a nod to film noir and carries a devastating sucker punch.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bob Hoskins most likely should have won the Oscar for Mona Lisa a crime love story if such a thing exists. One of the three best British crime films the other two being Get Carter and The Long Good Friday. Hoskins is George a getaway driver fresh out of prison who agrees to be a driver for a call girl. Michael Caine has a smaller yet noteworthy appearance as the mob boss Mortwell. I personally would have liked to seen Caine have more screen time in this but if he had he might have upstaged the two leading parts and therefore would have been a bad idea as far as the story goes. The viewer likes George admires George and some more than others know in a way what its like to be George. We identify with his plight having been in similar situations albeit with less danger involved. This film does leave the audience with a few unanswered questions. I believe I know what those answers are. I am not one hundred percent sure that I am correct. But I don't think it's important to know all the answers here. The situations are clearly defined and what happens is no mystery either. I will say that the ending is typical of films made in that decade and the decade previous to it. I can't say I will watch this one regularly but it is remarkable.".

	schema:reviewBody "Going into this I was expecting an alright film with a strong performance by Bob Hoskins. Boy was I so very wrong. Hoskins himself more than exceeded my expectations but the real surprise was how powerful the film itself was. Like a lot of my favorite films the premise is simple George Hoskins is fresh out of prison and gets a job as a driver for Simone Cathy Tyson a highclass call girl. It's an easy setup for a crime thriller when George inevitably takes a fancy to Simone and will do anything she asks but it's what they do beyond that which takes the film to another level. As a crime thriller it works brilliantly. I wish Neil Jordan would operate more in this genre because with this and the phenomenal Crying Game which came out six years later he has proved twice over his massive capability for making crime thrillers that are unique and wickedly intense.As George is driven down this dark path into the new underworld a place darker and more twisted than it was when he went away Jordan paces everything with a slow burn that gets downright diabolical in it's final act. Michael Caine shows up as the sinister crime boss and he practically tears through the screen with his malice along with a solid supporting turn by The Wire's Clarke Peters. There's an elevator scene near the end that just about made me sweat it was so intense and unexpected. Hoskins portrays George as an intimidating man with a rage inside of him but when he's on screen with Caine he looks like a chubby boy being picked on at the playground.The relationship between George and Simone is built in a refreshingly honest way played with genuine sincerity by Hoskins and Tyson and all of this leads to a practically flawless crime thriller. However that's not where the film stops as there is so much more going on beneath the surface. One could take it all at face value and still manage to be amazed I know I sure would have been but I found that the themes resonated far deeper than that. It's unspoken but I feel that the change of the world is really displayed in focus here by Jordan and in particular by Hoskins' portrayal of George. He came out of prison expecting to get right back into the crime game but the world has changed and grown far too menacing for someone as simple and goodnatured as him. George has a mean streak to him and is capable of great violence when necessary but at his heart he is a man who believes in the old ways.He went down for another man and when he comes out of prison he buys that man a rabbit to let him know that he's back. It's not done as a message of anything sinister but as a kind gesture to buy a fluffy rabbit with long floppy ears. Just take notice at how the tone of the film has shifted by the time the rabbit comes back at the end and we've come full circle and you can feel how the weight of this theme pours through the picture. Another subtle way they display it all is through how George dresses himself. When he first gets money for a new wardrobe he buys tacky and unsuitable clothing making a fool of himself but he finds it hilarious. As he takes his job more seriously he buys a finer wardrobe and the people that serve these wicked men take notice and respect him more as a result they treat him as if he's anyone else. It's when George begins to revolt back against this changed world that he once again goes back to his more flamboyant clothing and embraces the good man that he always was.There's so much going on in Hoskins' performance that isn't laid out for the audience but he makes it impossible not to see. That whole theme of coming out of prison to a much different and more frightening world is heartbreakingly portrayed through his expressions he carries the whole thing almost on his own. The guy falling for a prostitute routine has been done dozens of times in cinema over the years but there's an added weight to it here when Hoskins portrays the haunting loneliness of this character and how desperate he is just to have a companion. He's fresh out of prison in a world that doesn't want him anymore and all he wants is someone to treat him like he matters. This all comes through in the remarkably complex and detailed performance from Hoskins which commands this rich film all the way through. As a crime thriller it's aces but if you pay enough attention it is so much more.".

	schema:headline " Almost great modern noir";
	schema:reviewBody "Mona Lisa is an interesting predecessor to Neil Jordan's later masterpiece 'The Crying Game'. Taking in many of the same themes as the later film such as the nature of love affection and doing what's right Mona Lisa is an update of the classic film noir tradition that also has obvious ties with other genres such as crime romance and even comedy. One famous film that I would liken this one to is the Martin Scorsese classic 'Taxi Driver' as the two films deal with similar issues and follow a similar structure but Mona Lisa distances itself from the classic 70's movie because it has a very obvious heart at it's centre. The characterisation in the film is really well done and it's obvious that writers Neil Jordan and David Leland care a lot about the characters in the movie. The events of the film are almost all a result of character actions and the plot follows George an exconvict who has just been released from prison. He is given a job ferrying a highpriced call girl around her various jobs. What George doesn't count on is that the contempt he feels for her will turn into affection.Like The Crying Game before it Mona Lisa is a down and dirty gritty movie and this styling does the film no end of favours when it comes to portraying the plot. The movie's style bodes well with the themes on display and it also serves in giving it an edge of realism. However the film's main downfall is that while the atmosphere is realistic the acting largely isn't. Neil Jordan doesn't appear to know how to pull a convincing performance from his stars especially the female ones as a lot of the dialogue is delivered in a very forced and phoney sounding manner and it can get uncomfortable to view at times. Bob Hoskins does well at the film's core and what I said about the acting can't always be applied to his performance but there are definitely moments when holes begin to appear with him too. Also like Jordan's masterpiece the film's soundtrack is sometimes offcue and certain songs would have bee better off not being chosen for the soundtrack. However all of the film's flaws can be forgiven when the film reaches it's explosive conclusion as it's the perfect end to the film as it allows all of the characters to fully mature and Bob Hoskins in particular shines at the climax. On the whole Mona Lisa is a flawed but still highly admirable piece of work.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bob Hoskins' performance in Mona Lisa is usually highly praised and spoken in the same breath as his portrayal of hood boss Harold Shand in The Long Good Friday 1980. But apart from their shady dealings within the British criminal underworld their characters couldn't be more different. Where Harold was an oldfashioned respectable gangster who had excelled in his business now looking to go straight Mona Lisa's George is a petty crook fresh out of a long stretch in prison. They are both fascinating detailed portrayal's but I feel George is the more complex performance serving as a sad reminder of the fact that the world lost one of it's finest actors last year.Thrust back into a world that seems to evolved without him George manages to land a job driving call girls from client to client. His first customer is Simon Cathy Tyson a beautiful upperend call girl who clashes with George's bullheaded personality. She gives him money to buy some decent clothes and he shows up in a Hawaiian shirt and leather jacket. With time their differences become their bond and Simone asks George to help her find her old friend a young girl named Cathy Kate Hardie who is still in the hands of a sadistic pimp played by The Wire's Clarke Peters. Meanwhile George's old boss Denny Mortwell Michael Caine is suspicious of their activities and demands that George provide information on Simone.The movie doesn't go overthetop with its depiction of the capital's seedy underbelly but is far more subtle in the way it plays on our expectations. We're all aware of the presence of prostitutes in practically every town in the country but do we ever really consider what they spend their money on? How they are treated? Where do they sleep at night? We glimpse the true barbarism behind the red lights here something that George finds difficult to deal with. However the film is by no means grim with an excellent script by director Neil Jordan and David Leland providing many amusing moments particularly in the exchanges between George and his detective storyloving friend Thomas Robbie Coltrane.The performances are excellent all round. Hoskins is a rather lovable lunk proving to be almost insistent at drawing unwanted attention to himself and Simone at complete odds with this new world he stumbles across. He's the type of guy who asks for a cup of tea at a strip club. Tyson too what happened to her? projects real vulnerability under her mask of confidence and beauty. When the movie shifts from drama to thriller in the last third Caine becomes a menacing presence with a unnerving lack of emotion. All the filth we witness is all just business to him. By the end as what I initially thought was a characterdriven relationship drama turned into something else entirely the film had subverted my expectations so much that I had to just sit back and admire.".

It starts out almost exactly like Mr Bean's Holiday a guy on a southbound express train headed for the coast hoping for recreation. Which he won't find. That's where the the script leaves the common ground. It's rich in twists and turns clever to the point of cunning. Production design and cinematography are among the most elegant you will find. Cool minimalistic interior sets contrast with the timetested cinematic sparkle of the Cte D'Azur. Similarly wideangle shots are intercut with extreme closeups e.g. of pills dancing on a shaking spiral staircase the pulsing red halo of the caller light on a ringing telephone or a pair of shades dropped casually into an earthenware bowl. Scenes you have seen a thousand times this movie makes you see them with new eyes a guy killing time watching TV a car chase in an underground parking lot or someone having coffee and reading the paper in the morning sun. Admittedly Sophie Marceau helped to keep me interested. She plays a woman six years her junior and she more than gets away with it. She is in the shape of her life. I think she may have had something done to her face but it looks good and doesn't show. I can see why President Mitterand took her on his trips abroad as an icon of French allure. The fivesecond scene in which she wires herself for the showdown alone made it worth my while. The final plot twist may not be up to common standards of plausibility but it doesn't subtract from 90 minutes spent in silent wonder at what the French can do with a little sunshine and lot of mascara.".

Even when the main character is alone and therefore doesn't have to act in front of other characters who don't know who he really is he seems to react like it were the first time he is in fancy hotel etc. So in a way it's not the lead character who is lying to the other characters but the filmmakers who are lying to us viewers. It's a great joy when it's done playfully by someone like Brian De Palma in Dressed To Kill and Body Double but this trick is irrelevant here !The final twist notwithstanding the filmmakers are talented enough to create tension without resorting to many action setpieces.

Here's the setup a wanted criminal Anthony Zimmer is being hunted by the French police who want Zimmer in jail and by the Russian mafia who just want him dead. Zimmer however has recently acquired a new face via plastic surgery so nobody knows what he looks like now.He has a weakness however the femme fatale who in this case is Chiara Sophie Marceau who keeps in touch with Zimmer via classified messages in the HeraldTribune. As his girl friend she's instructed by letter from Zimmer to board a train and pick the man who most closely resembles Zimmer's size and shape  and then play up to him as though he was in fact Anthony Zimmer. Why? Because Zimmer wants an available sap to act as standin when the mafia make their hit...Enter poor Francois Taillandier Yvan Attal minding his own business on the train when the gorgeous Chiara sets down opposite and very adroitly gets Francois to join her in her travels to the Cote d'Azur and a luxurious holiday he thinks. Francois figures he's maybe in heaven for the first day a wonderful dinner followed by the potential for real romance.And then the sky falls in...In short order Francois is running for his life almost like Dustin Hoffman in Marathon Man 1976 and for similar reasons as the mafia try twice to kill him Chiara reveals that she set him up the mafia keep on trying to make a hit on him the police try to help him and Zimmer's still pulling the strings it seems. Things are closing in on Francois and it seems like only a matter of time before he takes a hit.Not everything is as it seems however...To say more would spoil this film for you. Suffice to say that like Hitchcock and others before the denouement between the police the mafia and the elusive Zimmer is very satisfying if somewhat contrived perhaps.The ending however does raise some interesting questions and provides no firm answers an aspect I particularly like  because that allows me to formulate the complete end according to my own inclination. Besides whenever you read about murder and mayhem in real life you never get the full story anyway. Right? The cinematography is exquisite on the French coastline the sound track is good the acting is...oh who cares...I was too busy looking at Sophie Marceau anyway. Okay  the acting was adequate but not spectacular.See this one. You won't regret the ninety minutes.".

Examples of stories starting with an encounter on the train can be easily found for various genre Strangers on a train 1951 Notre histoire 1984 Before sunrise 1995 just to name a few. Anthony Zimmer involves a crime mystery and a romance.The silly plot and the even sillier plot twist is there merely to provide a platform for Marceau and Attal to act and does not worth talking about. Marceau can play the role of the beautiful enigmatic women without even trying and Attal delivers the persona of an alltoo familiar absolutely ordinary guy caught in a whirlwind of unsought excitement to perfection. But then both handle the deeper second layer extremely well too. The well attended to mise en scene provides good support and the effective script carries the movie in a delightfully crisp pace through its relatively short 90 minutes.

Jerome Salle takes a leaf out of Patrice Leconte's book and starts on a pair of feminine feet but unlike Sandrine Bonnaire in Leconte's movie who wore granny shoes these are stylish high heels. In another departure Salle keeps us waiting to see the woman in question approximately three or four times as long as Leconte who revealed Bonnaire in less than one minute screen time. Salle teases us in several ways showing a female hand  her back is to us  selecting and lighting a cigarette in close up then more feet as she walks the length of a platform before finally boarding a train and walking past several empty seats to select a place opposite Yvan Attal  whom we might be forgiven for assuming is the eponymous Zimmer  and even then her eyes are hidden behind dark glasses. Friend Zimmer is by all accounts a criminal genius wanted far and wide by both sides of the law. Attal is strangely subdued this time around with little or none of the macho arrogance of his smalltime crook in 'Bon Voyage' and Sophie Marceau is suitably enigmatic as well she might be given the role she's been handed. Ultimately this is one you watch for the acting rather than the plot which could conceal itself behind a spiral staircase.".

	schema:headline " A much more serious film than the Hollywood remake...";
	schema:reviewBody "I'd seen 'The Tourist' when it first came out over a year ago. The Angelina JolieJohnny Depp starrer was an entertaining film...one of the things which prevented it from being great though was that it could never make up its mind as to whether it was a suspense thriller an action thriller or a comedy. But I'm pleased to say that the French original 'Anthony Zimmer' has no such identity crisis.The plot of 'Zimmer' is very simple and in retrospect I can't but help feel that 'The Tourist' sometimes needlessly embellished and in the process complicated the story. The simple premise allows for more focus on the characters their motivations and their relationships. Another thing that stuck me while watching this film in contrast to 'The Tourist' was that on the whole it was a much more 'intelligent' film...things weren't always explained to the audiences word for word. Some things the viewer needs to put together himself while watching the film. Case in point Chiara's Sophie Marceau motivation in befriending Francoise Tallandier Yven Attal as part of her scheme to fool Anthony Zimmer's pursuers is something which one has to assume based on the action onscreen and other subtle hintsits only explicitly spelled out more than halfway through the film whereas in 'The Tourist' its made glaringly clear to us pretty much from the start.A major superficial difference between the two versions is to do with the style and grandeur of the remake which is contrasted by the relative simplicity of the original. Whereas the remake had a speedboat chase in Venice the original has an equivalent scene of a chase sequence in an underground parking lot. The lack of emphasis on set designs and scenic beauty reinforces the film's prime focus on the character's and their story and also serves to give the film a much more 'serious' feel as opposed to the flamboyance of the remake.Special mention must be made of the lead actor Yven Attal. Unlike Johnny Depp's comedic take on the bumbling American tourist caught up in a world of intrigue Attal's character is an ordinary man who is keenly aware of the danger he's in but who also adapts to circumstances quickly enough. His relationship with Marceau's character does read more like genuine love as opposed to the relationship between Depp and Jolie in the remake which felt more like an infatuationfascination on Depp's part. Sophie Marceau's 'Chiara' is likewise a VERY different character from Angelina Jolie's 'Elise Ward'...unlike the glamorous and enigmatically playful Elise Chiara is a much harsher individual though she does reveal a softer side as the story progresses.On the whole I feel 'Anthony Zimmer' is a much more serious and tighter film than the remake though I will always remain a fan of the comically thrilling DeppJolie starrer as well!".

The Tourist is a funny and AZ is much more rugged despite the location.

Milorad Milinkovic makes impressive directorial debut with black comedy Mrtav 'ladan and I hope we'll see more of his work on this level. I would recommend his first movie to everyone who wants to laugh to tears cause you cannot stay uninterested in characters like Lemi Kiza Limeni Radovan Mica... Story is great in its simplicity characters are hilarious in sea of crazy ones my favorite is Radovan actors like Nikola Djuricko Srdjan Todorovic Nenad Jezdic or young Tara Manic are great actually I would write down every single actor in this movie there is also legendary Bata Zivojinovic and Serbian humor lines  curses hope you don't mind that are on high level. I don't want to say a thing about the plot just watch this movie and see for yourself hope people from Croatia Serbia Bosnia... won't regret it.

I would go as far as stating that this is one of my favorite movies of the year! This movie is reminiscent of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.";

Nor is it a documentary on the 80's New Wave extraordinaire band Berlin smell a severe case of biasism since it is my alltime favorite band that would be Berlin Hailing. The Berlin Calling I am referring to is the powerful independent German film Berlin Calling. Professional Trance Music Disc Jockey Paul Kalkbrenner stars as D.J. Ickarus a passionate  talented German trance spinning musician who also spins too many methamphetamines hallucinogens and narcotics in his daily social tunes. D.J. Ickarus drugaddiction downfall lands him in a Berlin psychiatric center which Ickarus finds too icky for his taste. Ickarus does cause havoc in the psychiatric center a la Jack Nicholson's character in One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest. Rita Lengyel effectively plays Mathilde Ickarus' devoted but gradually frustrated girlfriend who tries excessively to help Ick get out of the icky ills of his drug addiction while at the same trying to salvage his career. Corinna Harfouch psyches up her acting portraying Professor Dr. Detra Paul the authoritative psychiatric center director who is a cross between Nurse Hatchett and Dr. Phil. She feels that Ickarus is a danger to others and possibly himself so therefore she pulls her own mental control spins on him. Kalkbrenner's performance as Ickarus was mindboggling and put me in a trance of acting endowment. Moreover the multitalented Kalkbrenner's musical trance mixes caused me to want to get on The Metro and go Dancing In Berlin in Kalkbrenner's Tranceylvannia village! WriterDirector Hannes Stohr has many compelling and masterful plot lines  visuals stored for you in his imaginative filmmaking orchestration of Berlin Calling. An innovative narrative of the music trance environment captured in filmmaking has been long overdue. I was elated that Hannes had the upper hand in its origination! Berlin Calling also called to my attention its charttopping cinematography art direction and of course musical score. Hannes' Berlin Calling screenplay was also quite a comedic but yet gripping one that did not need No More Words to be regarded wordy adequate. I did have the pleasure to experience Berlin Calling at The Miami International Film Festival in March 2009. Hopefully a film studio distributor will sign up the film so everyone could be in the mix to the surreal cinematic art form of the brilliant Berlin Calling.  Excellent".

It does it so well that at the end I came out wanting to listen to the only electronic music CD I've got and I read on a famous Psychiatry manual about amphetamines. Music is great. So is the way it's interspersed with the story. The contrast between his interior world and the outside. Like when he made the psychiatrist listen to his music it was a bit loud for her consequently to us so that we notice. Then when he took out his perpetual headphones the music was gone. Music transmitted I's subjectivity his mental states so to speak.Characters Ickarus is fine as a narcissistic and shallow being with just a gift for something. When the shrink asks him if he ever read about Buddhism given he mentioned reincarnation or when he saw she wrote a book about famous artist who were also drug addicts he just didn't care. Mathilde was barely there. I wonder if her mouth is natural but she's sexy enough even with that stupid Adidas outfit. Her role just lacks something transmitting any feelings? but is nevertheless believable at least. She's his woman but is not exactly crazy about him at all. In fact at his first act of violence she outright leaves. And I as a Latin American perhaps was surprised at how little emotions do they show to each other. She is shown crying when he had a relapse but when sitting on a bench she is distant talking about her girlfriend as if she changed shoes. Then when he's out and in again at the clinic she's not even there. Finally they're together. She dropped gorgeous Corinna. There it goes she changed shoes again . Beautiful Alice is right on track. His psychiatric hospital mates are fine specially Crystal Pete. Prof. Dr. Petra Paul is gelid and coolly detached but in her context that's probably what they are like. She swallows insults from I.  M. like we'd take a diet Coke. We only see her really communicate with I. once the fly trapped on the glass scene. Not much for somebody who's supposed to help but her directive scenes like when she is leading the movement therapy or when she appears in the middle of the night with the guards during I's induced mayhem are fine. She is just efficient at putting limits . Social Psychology I've realized in this film I saw no feelings whatsoever. Neither family love friendship nothing. Not even good sex. Yes the menage a trois is well but even that doesn't satisfy I. at all. I wonder what would. Or how would he be when older. Living of social security like the only sound phrase he ever uttered threw at his brother you study at your 20s work in your 30s and live off the state from your 40s on. I's family structure is also weird coming from a Latin American like me. His Bach loving Vater is concerned but only shows up once at the hospital talks with the shrink after he relapsed twice in the film. He never offers him to live with him SOMETHING besides a moving hug. Same or even worse for his brother. Definitely Germans are colder than most of us! His social explanation on how the fall of the Berlin wall did harm to people is OK for a dad but poor for a movie. If things were like that half of Eastern Germany would be junkies ! Philosophy Morally Hungarian Mathilde is the only straight character of this parallel world without any bad attitude. Maybe the director writer's favourite? Like when Alice proposes her to be the manager of another DJ and she predictably and showing remarkable bad acting stills starts to recite It's about Ikarus I don't care for a job!. Surprisingly enough a bit later she ends up working at the door of the club. Economics Which takes me to how poor this world is. The big club owner asks her what do you want door or bar?. These are the only 2 jobs available besides the DJ. How sad. The hospital even with means and personnel that one would only dream of here in the 3rd world is nevertheless shown like a sad barren place to be. Again a cautionary tale specially because it just doesn't mean to. Sociologically interesting specially living in other parts of the world where both that and the fact that the state covered most of I. expensive treatment in private clean cells with only about 5 inmates in the whole facility makes me brood even in a lunatic asylum you live better than most Third World dweller.Everybody who is at the club is on drugs even the owner and of course the dealer. The blonde who is after Ikarus looks fine on the dance floor but yawning in the morning when she pops up at I's home right before his big album presentation... she is the image of despair. The dealer and her look like people without anything to say a ruin even when young. This is a nice film to show to people who think drugs are or could ever be cool by the way. Without being didactic in the sense that for instance he does throw away his pills and still perform like if nothing has happened. When somebody offers you drugs think Do I want to be wandering inside the subway's rail perpetually giving my money to some idiot just to be high then be very depressed out of nothing and even when treated so sleepy that I cant' tie my shoes or untreated think that standing up on the subway is a trip something that deserves a rotating camera whew feeling. Great film! Watch it on a theatre with good sound it surely delivers punch after punch. And I don't mean only the music.".

There were several really intense scene but they all left me rather uninterested especially those about the main character's drug abuse basically from start to finish. The actress who plays his girlfriend was as bad as the one who played the lesbian relationship. No idea what they were thinking with this subplot. Probably grasping for straws in terms of including sex to lure people into theatres. It probably would have helped if they had at least been attractive.No idea why this film has such a good reception and why a decent actress like Corinna Harfouch would appear in here. This was not an amateurishlooking effort but also not a particularly good one. In my case it probably doesn't help either that I really do not care for electronic music one of my least favorite genres. Very forgettable film in which I never felt for the character.

	schema:reviewBody "An earlier reviewer compared this to the Japanese cult favorite Battle Royale and decided it was almost junk. I beg to differ  the film needs to be evaluated on its own merits and its own story. Battle Royale is a single story about merciless wanton and senseless violence and depravity when the aim was simply to be the last to survive  a kill fest where the innovative ways of killing serve to shock and titillate the audience but do little for the plot. The Hunger Games however is about oppression fighting back and revolution. The Games though pivotal are still part of a larger story.Compared to the first film this one is definitely darker. The characters look even more despondent than ever and if you thought there were few laughs in the first film there is practically none in this. Even the brightlylit scenes featuring cheering crowds and smiling hosts seemed dim bleak and depressing. While enjoying the witty banter you couldn't help but wait for the 'but...'. The feeling of doom and gloom persists from the start to the end of the film. It is not a bad thing though  it is not supposed to be a happy movie.Many details and subplots were understandably cut from the film adaptation but none that were critical to the plot of the film. However a lot of the peripheral action that were in the book is missing here hence though the story moves quickly enough there is always the feeling that for an actionthriller there aren't enough fights or explosions. The ones they movie do have aren't exciting or grand enough.But in terms of storytelling the movie still works to move from the first film and prepare for the third. The seeds of revolution have been planted and watered and we now prepare for the maturing and harvesting.Jennifer Lawrence didn't do as well here as in the last film probably because most of the growing needed has been done previously. Josh Hutcherson though put in a better performance. While he may previously be the injured lovestruck puppy dog his maturing into a more complex character in this movie means he starts carrying more of the film.Emotionally this movie affected me less than the last one. Maybe it's partly because I know what is coming but that accounts for a very minor percentage. Mostly it's because the film is unable to engage your baser emotions  nothing that truly tugs at your heartstrings. The pervading gloom also seems to have sapped any ability to feel more despondent than you think you already are.It is still a movie that can be enjoyed though and I did enjoy it enough. Hopefully the next film will provide for more emotional variance. If you don't feel for the characters you won't care about the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have neither seen the first movie nor read the book. So I should admit that I am an outsider to this Hunger Games hype. However high expectations for this sequel among the fans and high rating at IMDb tempted me to watch it. The first thing I do not really get is 8.3 rating here. My ratings and IMDb ratings have never fallen that apart in recent years!The first 130 hours ie complete duration of a regular feature film is definitely one of the most boring fist halves I have ever seen. The story evolves but without any strategic emphasis or proofs on none of the important plots of the story. The directing was so weak that I would not understand a real uprising is baking among the districts if president Snow had explicitly informed us about that risk previously in the opening. The Victors' Tour meeting scenes were definitely far from adequate to reflect the revolutionary atmosphere in the districts.Jennifer Lawrence's performance is one of the good things in the movie. In fact in some parts her lead was the only reason to stay focused. But despite her acting performance we could not get her actual view of the events. The hope she creates in the people or what she really cares even her indecision between two man was not properly explored. And considering this superficial character building for the lead role I am not surprised none of the other characters had a chance to become real. Shallow characters wasted a lot of drama during the film especially in the more intense action scenes. Director's understanding of character building is having mere closeups on beautiful face of Katniss Everdeen.President Snow can not escape from the fate of being a shallow character. While Snow is the symbol of the authoritarian government his character was only partly revealed and the director misses the valuable moments with sub par dialogs between Snow and his grand daughter or others to create a solid portrait of a man of power and loneliness.Finally in the second half the action starts. Despite the quality of the cinematography even action scenes can not surround you enough. As an important example the idea of poisonous fog is a brilliant one but the chase between the spreading fog and Katniss and her allies is not thrilling or even believable at all.The final is the worst part. The whole final scene rushed into a mere couple of minutes to miss and ruin many important aspects of the story. Revealing the revolutionaries explaining the whole grand plan behind the 75th hunger game are all squeezed into 23 sequences in the last 5 minutes. This short and economical final is of course a choice of director Francis Lawrence but then why did he kill us by boredom of around two and a half hours?And of course the final scene is like a teaser of a TV series for inviting the audience to the third hunger games. No Sir movies should be complete even if there will be planned sequels. There is a start and an end to the movies at least the ones I prefer to watch.So why I still gave it a 510. I think this very poorly directed story is indeed interesting and progressive. The Capital suppressed and poor districts growing feeling of injustice police terror authoritarian and corrupt government and dictator Snow. All make up a good setting for a dystopian yet realistic scifi atmosphere. But director trivializes this brilliant story. Still Jennifer Lawrence leads the movie with her strong character. Cinematography is good despite lacking in drama especially in action scenes. So the story would have really made it big in the big screen. But in the hands of Francis Lawrence it became a boring and long scifi flick.While I was leaving the theater I was still trying to understand why it got 8.3 from IMDb. Fans?".

	schema:headline " The Hunger Games Remake";
	schema:reviewBody "Having watched the first Hunger Games with some appreciation I was decidedly eager to watch the second. How wrong I was.The basis of the film is laid out fairly quickly. There is discontent among the enslaved Districts. Katniss' inadvertent televised defiance of the autocratic Capitol by surviving the Hunger Games has shown its yoked peoples that it is not invincible. Hope threatens to displace fear and there are instances of open defiance threatening to bubble over into fullblown insurrection. All that is needed is the touchpaper to be lit. However fearful for the people and the retribution they will suffer Katniss is unwilling to act as a symbol against the regime.This amounts to the first twenty minutes of the film. OK you think. Solid if uninspired. So she reluctantly becomes the figurehead of a revolution which topples the dastardly government.  However before proceeding down this welltrod path the filmmakers decide that we first need to watch a remake of the first film with the same actors.Katnis finds herself obligated to fight in the next Hunger Games and must go through the same routine of making the public gush over her to win favour and friends train in hightech sterile quarters and accept the impossibility of surviving the games against superior foes. The difference is that there is a rebel conspiracy among some of the contestants and Games' ChiefProducer to ensure Katniss survive.However when finally it is revealed to Katnis that the plan had always been for her to survive even at the cost of others I felt not the faintest murmur of surprise. The big twist wouldn't have registered on a CAT scan. Throughout the film it is alluded to nay explicated without subtlety ambiguity or misdirection. For example contestants keep dying on her behalf with no hint of reason. But this itself isn't even developed into an independent pillar of the film the main body of which is unaltered i.e. fighting surviving and the nominal selfsacrifice of disposable fringe characters.The other major failed attempt to distinguish this film from the first was to introduce a genuine love interest for Katniss. The first scene of the film sees Katniss saying goodbye to her beloved...I don't remember his name. His contribution is to play martyr against nasty Capitol stormtroopers obliging Katniss to intervene to save him from summary execution. This is the last straw for the Capitol who declare another Hunger Games  where Katniss will kill her allies and thus discredit her as a source of inspiration for the people. It was my feeling though that the story could have got there easily enough without him. In terms of plot development he was only there to  in chess problem terms  dress the board. Eventually he joins the rebellion I think and then isn't even referenced for the whole second half of the film.One thing it did achieve was to thicken the theme of Peeta's unrequited love for Katniss and her increasing  genuine or not??  affection for him. I felt there was some body to this thread which felt like it was actually being developed throughout the film  rather than merely another aching turn of the plotwheel. What might be interpreted as a stolid performance by Josh Hutcherson I thought did as much as it could to convey Peeta's character as otherwise implied by the script. Decent dutiful unquerulous. The CGI was dependable enough if not groundbreaking. The Capitol was predictable grandiosity symmetry and perpendiculars. One of the few fine moments in the film was the scene in which Katniss' twirls and in doing so burns off her innocuous frock revealing her unwittingly attired to resemble a Mockingjay  the symbol of the Resistance  live on primetime TV. For me the best bit of the film is the performance of Stanley Tucci as Caesar Flickerman the host of the Hunger Games broadcasts. He was a welcome source of light in a film which can otherwise be summed up as dimlylit and lugubrious. Loud bright strident believably eccentric and garrulous just a degree removed from the modern day chat show host which lends some authenticity to the film as a meaningful commentary on the condition of society.In sum though the resulting film is one that makes promises on which it does not deliver. Once it was over most of me was relieved but the remaining part was still waiting for it to start. I felt cheated. Like buying a ticket to a fairground ride which is actually just a queue for a ride C. South Park or dumbly watching a frozen chicken slowly turning in the oven and then being served it long before it's ready. My advice If you want to watch Hunger Games Part 2 wait for Hunger Games Part 3".

	onyx:emotionText "Having watched the first Hunger Games with some appreciation I was decidedly eager to watch the second. How wrong I was.The basis of the film is laid out fairly quickly. There is discontent among the enslaved Districts. Katniss' inadvertent televised defiance of the autocratic Capitol by surviving the Hunger Games has shown its yoked peoples that it is not invincible. Hope threatens to displace fear and there are instances of open defiance threatening to bubble over into fullblown insurrection. All that is needed is the touchpaper to be lit. However fearful for the people and the retribution they will suffer Katniss is unwilling to act as a symbol against the regime.This amounts to the first twenty minutes of the film. OK you think.

	schema:reviewBody "I went to see this movie after seeing that in IMDb it got a rating of 8.3 out of 10. Even though I saw some bad reviews about it I was certain that a movie that got such a high rating in this kind of site must have something to offer. My god was I wrong. Where do I begin?Dialogue is poorly written and awkward at times. For example when Peeta finds a pearl in the clam he just tells Katniss For you or something and she replies with Thanks and takes the pearl. Wow. Just wow. What was the screenwriter or whoever writes that thing thinking? I honestly started laughing when I heard these lines.Screen time is wasted and an hour and fifteen minutes into the movie almost nothing happened and I started drifting away something that has never happened in the first movie which I saw like three times. They did switch directors from the first movie and it shows.Unlike the previous Hunger Games the sequel is plain boring even in its most actionpacked scenes such as the toxic fog and the part where Peeta dies. So they manage to get past the fog and Peeta lives. Wooh a twist! Everything that happens is so damn predictable and just uninteresting. Since over an hour passed until the games actually start we don't get a chance to bond with the other tributes and we just don't care about anyone except Katniss and Peeta. The part where the old lady runs into the fog in order to save the others could be much more emotional for the viewer if we only cared about her!Also ending a movie with a cliffhanger like this is just frustrating and plain lazy. This is something you can do in a TV series where you get to see the resolution in the next episode in a week but when done in a movie it is clearly a way to force us viewers to watch the next sequel in order to get a satisfying resolution and cashin on the way. In short the ending is disappointing and doesn't resolve anything that happened so far. Did I just pay a full price for a prequel to when the story really kicks in to action?I can go on and on about other things such as the poor decisionmaking done by some of the characters The barechested tribute knifing down the genius' wife while exposing himself to Katniss shooting him in the chest or the stereotypical depiction of soldiers being sadistic ruthless and unmerciful like robots instead of showing some small shred of humanity. I mean seriously the Nazis weren't this cruel.However there are some good sides to this movie. Jennifer Lawrence acts wonderfully and does try to express some of Katniss' feelings. She does a great job. Josh Hutcherson gives a decent performance as well playing the confusedfromloveandfame Peeta. Other sidecharacters are depicted very well and the overall acting in this film is superb.Here and there there are some stronger scenes that save the movie from being a total bore such as the fight against the baboons and Katniss and Peeta's first speech which was wonderfully acted.Overall this is a 5. There are some bright spots here and there in this movie but they are just outweighed by the general boredom and heaviness of the rest of the film and I found myself not giving a damn about nearly anything that happened on screen. Great acting and some strong scenes are burdened by poor dialogue and weak directing.And that's pretty much it. I can't believe that this movie is believed to be one of 2013's best movies.".

	schema:headline " Let the flames begin...";
	schema:reviewBody "I was lucky enough to be able to watch the movie one week early since it opened here in Brazil one week before the release in the US and I must tell you this fellow The Hunger Games fans even though my English is not even that good Catching Fire is a GREAT experience and one that improves over the first film in nearly every possible level.When I first read the books I thought that they were not only incredibly addicting and fun but also with an important message for the youngsters and every other person age is not important who read it and that made it different from some of the other uninteresting YA books around. I really liked the trilogy and when I watched the first adaptation I was disappointed with some aspects and routes they went with it. It was not an horrible movie at all but it was not very faithful to the book and lacked the impact I found in the novel.With that in mind I kept my excitement in close watch with Catching Fire and went expecting a good movie and nothing more. I was welcomed with an excellent surprise the movie followed the events of the novel whenever possible and brilliantly so while managing to keep me on the edge of my seat even though I knew what was going to happen the entire time.I won't go into details about the plot of the movie some fellow reviewers already did it probably better than I'll ever do and the chances you're familiar with it are high. So I'll go right into the review and my opinions on the picture.Francis Lawrence was nothing short of an excellent choice for the director's chair gone are the shaky camera action one of my major problems with the first film and welcome are thrilling and pumping action scenes that expertly convey the tension and ferocity of the moment. He managed to keep the violence and shock without ever crossing the line and whoever read the books know how important this is it's part of the plot of the criticism and one of the main elements that make the whole point of the film. He keeps you interested and invested in the story even when nothing bombastic is happening and that is a great achievement something that really sets this sequel apart.But Francis is not alone on making this movie special. His young and talented cast lead by the always amazing Jennifer Lawrence is ferocious and eager to invest in their characters making you an ally or an enemy while watching everything unfold. Lawrence shows us again why she was the perfect choice to play the now iconic Katniss Everdeen she makes you root for this young brave lady every single minute of the struggle with her sad hopeless stare that pierces your soul to her ability to convey admirable strength when everything seems to be out of reach are phenomenal and she deserves the praise she gets.The rest of the cast is uniformly good but I have to highlight Jena Malone who plays the explosive Johanna her presence makes the screen on fire whenever she's in mixing the perfect amount of attitude and humor. A particular scene involving an elevator and a fancy dress is at the same time hilarious and shocking just like her character. Donald Sutherland also shines as the menacing president Snow in a restrained performance that doesn't need too many words spoken to make you think twice on how dangerous he is.The set pieces are also vastly improved upon bigger more ambitious and work perfectly in sync with the action to make for some really unforgettable moments. The arena looks beautiful and foreboding hiding it's dangers behind the shining green water. So does the bizarre Capitol and the Districts full of sadness and fear two dichotomies in every aspect.But what I really liked about the movie was that they didn't shy away from the political aspects from the novel and conveyed the despair and oppression imposed by the Capitol over the rest of Panem. It makes you think that all of this is happening around the world in one way or another maybe masquerade but it is. It's sad that many teenagers are only in this ride for the hot action and beautiful people some screaming girls in the movie theater I went only confirm this.

	onyx:emotionText "I was lucky enough to be able to watch the movie one week early since it opened here in Brazil one week before the release in the US and I must tell you this fellow The Hunger Games fans even though my English is not even that good Catching Fire is a GREAT experience and one that improves over the first film in nearly every possible level.When I first read the books I thought that they were not only incredibly addicting and fun but also with an important message for the youngsters and every other person age is not important who read it and that made it different from some of the other uninteresting YA books around. I really liked the trilogy and when I watched the first adaptation I was disappointed with some aspects and routes they went with it. It was not an horrible movie at all but it was not very faithful to the book and lacked the impact I found in the novel.With that in mind I kept my excitement in close watch with Catching Fire and went expecting a good movie and nothing more. I was welcomed with an excellent surprise the movie followed the events of the novel whenever possible and brilliantly so while managing to keep me on the edge of my seat even though I knew what was going to happen the entire time.I won't go into details about the plot of the movie some fellow reviewers already did it probably better than I'll ever do and the chances you're familiar with it are high. So I'll go right into the review and my opinions on the picture.Francis Lawrence was nothing short of an excellent choice for the director's chair gone are the shaky camera action one of my major problems with the first film and welcome are thrilling and pumping action scenes that expertly convey the tension and ferocity of the moment. He managed to keep the violence and shock without ever crossing the line and whoever read the books know how important this is it's part of the plot of the criticism and one of the main elements that make the whole point of the film. He keeps you interested and invested in the story even when nothing bombastic is happening and that is a great achievement something that really sets this sequel apart.But Francis is not alone on making this movie special. His young and talented cast lead by the always amazing Jennifer Lawrence is ferocious and eager to invest in their characters making you an ally or an enemy while watching everything unfold. Lawrence shows us again why she was the perfect choice to play the now iconic Katniss Everdeen she makes you root for this young brave lady every single minute of the struggle with her sad hopeless stare that pierces your soul to her ability to convey admirable strength when everything seems to be out of reach are phenomenal and she deserves the praise she gets.The rest of the cast is uniformly good but I have to highlight Jena Malone who plays the explosive Johanna her presence makes the screen on fire whenever she's in mixing the perfect amount of attitude and humor. A particular scene involving an elevator and a fancy dress is at the same time hilarious and shocking just like her character. Donald Sutherland also shines as the menacing president Snow in a restrained performance that doesn't need too many words spoken to make you think twice on how dangerous he is.The set pieces are also vastly improved upon bigger more ambitious and work perfectly in sync with the action to make for some really unforgettable moments. The arena looks beautiful and foreboding hiding it's dangers behind the shining green water. So does the bizarre Capitol and the Districts full of sadness and fear two dichotomies in every aspect.But what I really liked about the movie was that they didn't shy away from the political aspects from the novel and conveyed the despair and oppression imposed by the Capitol over the rest of Panem. It makes you think that all of this is happening around the world in one way or another maybe masquerade but it is. It's sad that many teenagers are only in this ride for the hot action and beautiful people some screaming girls in the movie theater I went only confirm this. They were not the majority it was packed and most people were also extremely annoyed by it too  every time Finnick appeared it was a screaming hell. It has so much more to offer.The Hunger Games Catching Fire not only improves vastly upon it's predecessor it's a great cinematic experience by itself touching on important topics about the modern day society without losing it's thrilling core. It's not perfect but what it does right it goes right into the bullseye. Don't let the hype or the teen fury on this fool you it is entertainment at it's best.";

I was lucky enough to wait til it was available to rent. I really enjoyed the first hunger games because it kind of felt like the novel 1984. Catching fire switched more to a twilight love issue between Peeta and Gale. First Katiness wants to run off with Gale but he refuses because he wants to join the revolution. Then she starts falling in love with Peeta during the Games Woohoo another twilight!.Jennifer Lawrence's performance was terrible during the whole movie. It seems she cannot display the right facial emotion. I was getting annoyed the entire time she tried to make a sad face. Josh Hutcherson on the other hand displayed great acting and did pretty good with a terrible script this kid has a bright acting career ahead of him after the Twilight Games. During the games we don't have a chance to have a connection with the other Tributes at all. I just kept finding myself thinking Oh the old lady died or Guy 2 just died from arrow shot.At the end Peeta just disappears out of near. We never find out why he ran away but that he was caught by the president. Wow the writers waste all this movie time with worthless scenes but they can't add this in? If you're looking for a Hunger games like the first one. Then you're going to be disappointed. If you're a twelve year old girl who enjoys wanting to know if Katiness is going to be with Peeta or Gale. Then this movie is for you but you'll have to wait for the third one to find out.Twilight Games makes for a great movie to make you fall asleep though.".

I had been looking forward to the film for months but I kept my expectations low. I am unhappy to report that Catching Fire is not the success that the reviews would have you believe. In the end it was a really really lousy movie.When I saw the initial previews for Catching Fire the teaser trailer and the first theatrical trailer I was aflame with excitement. But the film itself was flavorless too tame too watered down and too rushed. For a movie about teens locked in an arena forced to fight to the death... I don't think I saw more than a cupful of blood drawn by a weapon. This is absolutely unacceptable because the violence plays a very critical part in the source material's themes the glamorizing of violence present day desensitization to violence and the sensationalism of modern entertainment among others. But instead of exploring these and other ideas in the film the gamemakers  sorry I mean filmmakers  just watered down the politics and everything else that might have induced too much thinking to appeal to the widest audience possible. I was speaking with someone about the film after we saw it and he put forth the idea that perhaps the thinning of the material was fiscally strategic. He suggested that maybe if the film was too complex it just simply would not translate well into other languages. Since overseas gross is a gigantic portion of blockbuster film revenue I thought this was an excellent point and true to some degree. Among the other simplifications was the story of the rebellion and even just the barbarism of those in the Capital. These two things detailed extensively in the novel had barely any depth in the film.The film was severely brought down by the godawful music which was very poorly integrated. I lost count of the number of scenes where it would have had much greater emotional impact without the added music.Catching Fire was overproduced and rushed. The CGI in the film looked very phony. But they filmed on location in Hawaii and had a massive budget 130 milliondouble the budget of the first film so why are huge chunks of the arena made of obviousCGI? Other than for say the baboon creatures there is no reason why this film should have the amount of CGI it does. The excessive effects took away from the film's authenticity and feeling. Catching Fire looks like a expensive overdone Hollywood product.The same thing that happened with the first film is happening with Catching Fire. The first film was highly anticipated released to critical praise and made boatloads of cash. Then as time went on people's opinion of the film went down. People started to admit that it wasn't that amazing. Meanwhile the studio pocketed the profits and fasttracked the sequel. The hype for the sequel was insane and then it was released. The second film received even more critical praise than the first film had a bigger budget and made more money. And I can guarantee time will go on and once people are not high on the hype they will realize that the film isn't so fantastic. But it doesn't matter because the studio is pocketing the profits and now pumping out two backtoback sequels....Sound like a familiar pattern? Yes. Yes it does. It sounds a little bit like... The Dark Knight Rises 2012? And so many other ballbusters. Sorry sorry I mean blockbusters. This happens really really often and it annoys me.All one must do to learn the truth about Catching Fire amongst all the biased boughtandpaidfor critics and the delusional mooing public is to observe. The truth can be gained from simple observation.Catching Fire is slap in the face to any fan of the book. The sad irony of it all is that the crowds stuffing soldout showings of Catching Fire strongly resemble the Capital citizens eagerly awaiting the latest Hunger Games battle.

	schema:reviewBody "Really this movie has a quite nice prologue ... but as it turns out its all prologue. We see the home front then a tour of the provinces followed by the splendour of the capital. A spectacular triumph for the survivors of the gladiatorial games of the past. All the competitors are given a nice bladerunner like intro sequence. They each have a 'special skill' ie. sort of a superpower. Just in case you missed this they get another intro via an alllive allprovince glammed up TV interview. Very flash! But it is all building up to the 'games' and when we finally get to those games they are over before they really get started.And it turns out this time its a team sport rather than a first person shooter type of game as in the first movie. Our heroine of course is pretty good with a bow her 'super power'. But when it comes to choosing teammates that's when the plot starts to fall down. In a fight to the death with no chance of a reprieve do you a choose the carnivorous teeth sharpened jugular biting woman from the district where they have to go head to head with large vicious baboons 'think beauty and the beast  she's both' or b do you choose the nice little old lady who dabbles with healing herbs? Do you go for the guy who can throw a spear with enough force to mow down 5 holograms in a row or do you choose the weirdos in the corner puttering about with the arts  crafts who the others nickname nuts and volts. Maybe 'Volts' is a misunderstood genius but the herb lady is so old and arthritic she has to be carried everywhere she goes and her herbs are pretty much useless.So OK our heroine is pretty good with a bow but is not very smart and is useless at picking teammates. But she has an adviser who should know what he is doing who tells her 'stay away from nuts  volts ... and don't even think about that nice little old lady'. But who does she end up with as teammates? How does this happen? Its not exactly clear. Supposedly they are planning the great 'revolution' but its not a revolution that our heroine wants any part of. She seems to have no political ideas and no ideas on how to win the games. I'm quite partial to revolution and political ideas like Terry Gilliam's Brazil but actually there is nothing revolutionary or political in this movie. It makes Luke Skywalker look like he has a PhD in political science so devoid is it of any real social commentary or political insight. OK she comes from a remote mining district and so is not very well educated and has little to no social skills or political savvy. And the older wiser authority figure is no ObiWan Kenobi who can tell her what is happening or given any useful advice his special skill seems to be drinking straight from the bottle. And so she gets it into her small unthinking mind that she should sacrifice herself for her 'great love Peeta' or as we would call him ... Peter. Never mind that she does not really care for him and that their 'love' is a ploy by the state to keep the masses contented. He is a bit like her gay best friend ... useless no special skills of any kind always falling over running into force fields and that kind of thing ... but looks good on TV and and gives good motivational speeches. So of course he is on her team ... and when we finally get to the games she is constantly mumbling 'we have to save Peeta'. That gets old really fast! For 2 hours we wait for these great games to get started which are supposed to entertain and thrill the entire world's population and then all we get is a bit of wandering around in the jungle and mumbling about how 'Peeta' must survive. Even though the old lady with the herbs and who need a wheelchair is more likely to live longer than this toyboy! There is no fighting no devious plots no 'thumbs up or thumbs down' moments. What is the first thing that happens? 'Peeta' runs into a force field despite having been given a tutorial about detecting force fields. He should have been blown to bits but seemingly by magic he is brought back to life no not by the herb lady  that would have made too much sense.Once they've wandered around the jungle a bit they need a plan. The 'game makers' have left a spool of cable lying about and 'Volts' immediately comes up with a 'plan' that is just a rehash of the one he used to win by some miracle it seems a previous game. Past games are of course televised and studied by all the gladiators so anyone could tell you will end in disaster ... and of course it does turn out to be a complete disaster. But then just before being blasted to oblivion our heroine comes up with the idea of plugging an extension cord from the bedroom socket into the kitchen socket. Will this form the great infinite electrical loop that will destroy the world's electrical grid? All that will happen is that if you are not careful you will get a nasty shock and die. And we would say good riddance to them. But our heroine as if by magic survives the nasty shock being only stunned ... but is mistaken for dead by the 'game makers' who helicopter her seemingly dead body out. Depriving us of the GAME! The title being Hunger Games ... and the so called 'games' end seemingly before they have begun. Games which we have waited more than 2 hours to get started. Now that is a disappointment!".

Do you go for the guy who can throw a spear with enough force to mow down 5 holograms in a row or do you choose the weirdos in the corner puttering about with the arts  crafts who the others nickname nuts and volts. Maybe 'Volts' is a misunderstood genius but the herb lady is so old and arthritic she has to be carried everywhere she goes and her herbs are pretty much useless.So OK our heroine is pretty good with a bow but is not very smart and is useless at picking teammates. But she has an adviser who should know what he is doing who tells her 'stay away from nuts  volts ... and don't even think about that nice little old lady'. But who does she end up with as teammates? How does this happen? Its not exactly clear. Supposedly they are planning the great 'revolution' but its not a revolution that our heroine wants any part of. She seems to have no political ideas and no ideas on how to win the games. I'm quite partial to revolution and political ideas like Terry Gilliam's Brazil but actually there is nothing revolutionary or political in this movie. It makes Luke Skywalker look like he has a PhD in political science so devoid is it of any real social commentary or political insight. OK she comes from a remote mining district and so is not very well educated and has little to no social skills or political savvy. And the older wiser authority figure is no ObiWan Kenobi who can tell her what is happening or given any useful advice his special skill seems to be drinking straight from the bottle. And so she gets it into her small unthinking mind that she should sacrifice herself for her 'great love Peeta' or as we would call him ... Peter. Never mind that she does not really care for him and that their 'love' is a ploy by the state to keep the masses contented. He is a bit like her gay best friend ... useless no special skills of any kind always falling over running into force fields and that kind of thing ... but looks good on TV and and gives good motivational speeches. So of course he is on her team ... and when we finally get to the games she is constantly mumbling 'we have to save Peeta'. That gets old really fast! For 2 hours we wait for these great games to get started which are supposed to entertain and thrill the entire world's population and then all we get is a bit of wandering around in the jungle and mumbling about how 'Peeta' must survive. Even though the old lady with the herbs and who need a wheelchair is more likely to live longer than this toyboy! There is no fighting no devious plots no 'thumbs up or thumbs down' moments. What is the first thing that happens? 'Peeta' runs into a force field despite having been given a tutorial about detecting force fields. He should have been blown to bits but seemingly by magic he is brought back to life no not by the herb lady  that would have made too much sense.Once they've wandered around the jungle a bit they need a plan. The 'game makers' have left a spool of cable lying about and 'Volts' immediately comes up with a 'plan' that is just a rehash of the one he used to win by some miracle it seems a previous game. Past games are of course televised and studied by all the gladiators so anyone could tell you will end in disaster ... and of course it does turn out to be a complete disaster. But then just before being blasted to oblivion our heroine comes up with the idea of plugging an extension cord from the bedroom socket into the kitchen socket. Will this form the great infinite electrical loop that will destroy the world's electrical grid? All that will happen is that if you are not careful you will get a nasty shock and die. And we would say good riddance to them. But our heroine as if by magic survives the nasty shock being only stunned ... but is mistaken for dead by the 'game makers' who helicopter her seemingly dead body out. Depriving us of the GAME! The title being Hunger Games ... and the so called 'games' end seemingly before they have begun. Games which we have waited more than 2 hours to get started. Now that is a disappointment!";

	schema:reviewBody "After a massive let down from watching the first movie I was surprisingly curious enough to wonder where the story would go in the second. My main issue in the first film was a lack of a compelling and believable story but I walked in the theater to see this one anyway hoping the film makers sought redemption for what was so abysmal. It didn't surprise me much however to find that story was once again dry rigid and crusted over with garbage just like a dog turd on a summer sidewalk.The story continues directly from the events following the victory of Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark in the hunger games. President Snow crafts the two characters towards into public figures forcing them to positively represent the government to gain more popularity for the hunger games. The movie actually starts out quite promising as we see a great deal of tension growing between the districts and the state. We see the very beginning of martial law come into effect rebels planning to coalesce and fear permeating through the characters. It looks very good until Hollywood decides drop by the scriptwriters' office with another visit. This movie's only purpose is to give you hope of something good and then crush by sending you back to the train wreck of a film we experienced in the first movie. By this point if you haven't done so already get ready to kick back and watch the nonsensical onslaught continue. That's right you're in for another hunger game!About less than halfway into the movie the viewer is virtually left watching the first movie all over again. The director should have saved time filming and simply cut and paste the first movie in at this point. While the characters are busy killing each other for the second time it is hard not to hope that we will get some more information about what is happening on the home front. What is the government doing? How are the districts reacting? How are the families of the main characters in district 12? Rather than our questions getting answered all we get are some more scenes of Katniss and her bow Peeta falling in love with her for the second time and poorly developed characters who we are supposed to feel sorry for die. Also similarly to the first movie we see more attempts of intimidation among the players chances to win sponsorships lots of prep talk before the big fight and a shot of all of the contestants broadcasted in their kooky outfits before they get shipped off to the slaughter house.There are a few things I should probably mention before some fans of the movie do. Not that it matters but the hunger game in this movie is slightly different from that of the first. In response to the uproars in the districts the government expresses their displeasure by sending previous victors from each district back into the hunger games. This really makes no difference for the viewer since we see over 20 new bloodthirsty contestants besides Katniss and Peeta anyway. A few other trivial differences include the new arena the game takes place in. This time the characters start the fight in the water rather than on land. Also the whole arena is apparently bigger even though it just looks like another forest and there are environmental hazards that occur on an hourly schedule. It really doesn't matter and it is painful to think that the filmmakers think they can win their audience over with such a frivolous change. In my opinion the only thing that this franchise really has that wins its popularity is their main cast Jennifer Lawrence. But that doesn't fix the story. The essence of the film is still fundamentally flawed. It is no different than trying to treat the scent of a puddle of diarrhea with fabreeze air freshener!At one point in the movie Katniss and her friends contrive a plot to eliminate the remaining contestants. Out of nowhere in the middle of the plan's execution she somehow figures out how to escape the arena and the entire infrastructure collapses. Suddenly Katniss is rescued by a ship as if the whole plan to escape was coordinated from the beginning and she requests to return to her home. She and the audience learn that district 12 has been destroyed. The movie ends. A long silence follows until the credits roll along with an animation of the mocking jay pin. Not only is this one of the most abrupt and unsatisfying endings to a film in the history of films but the director adds insult to injury as he essentially tells us Too bad you missed out on all of the important stuff that happened in the real world and instead you got to watch the first movie over again! Not only do we get a repeat of what already happened but we are left in complete darkness and miss out of every single detail that could have potentially progressed the storyline. The movie could have literally been cut in half if the whole hunger game was removed and we still would have gotten the same amount of essence from the story. This movie is a prime example of how Hollywood takes something with a lot of potential and strips it of all nutrients until it becomes as bare as a pile of elephant dung. The film is nothing more than a monotonous moneymaking expedient that deserves to be flushed down the toilet! The only reason why I regard it slightly higher than the first is for the first few scenes of the movie that actually grabbed my attention. In retrospect that momentary grasp of interest wasn't worth the other two hours of an appalling scam.".

	schema:headline " Katniss or Kantmiss. This sequel is a copy.";
	schema:reviewBody "Spoiler Alert. Enjoy the movie first if you don't want to be sullied by another's opinion. First there is another movie in the wings and given the boffo box office of this meager effort will make millions more. Let's see how can we take a formula alter it slightly and still keep the same thing? Make a sequel to The Hunger Games and call it Catching Fire. We have a subplot involving the revolution that we thought was set off in the first movie. Obviously it wasn't but with Katniss' providing the impetus rebellious elements are at work in this movie. One is reminded of the Matrix.In normal human existence those that benefit give enough to those who don't so there will not be a revolution. Here nothing is given back but propaganda. Kind of reminds me of the current American administration but that's not for this post. It's all so formulaic and predictable. The whole goal is to get the Whole World to hate Katniss Let the floggings begin while showing Katniss in a wedding dress. Starve the people while showing Katniss at an elaborate dinner. This let them eat cake motive just doesn't work. Potboilers are not new. Sinclair Lewis wrote Kingsblood Royal and it was a potboiler par excellence. But a potboiler inside a potboiler just gilds the Lily. Why? Here's my opinion inside of an opinion There is simply not enough material to make three good movies but we want to stretch the franchise. So let's stretch the first concept from a pretty well done movie and see how much we can make without much effort. That what the producers must have been thinking. And make a fortune they did while elevating JenLaw into international stardom. We know that our heroine will not be killed so this movie just drags through The Perils of Pauline but with supporting actors who do a good job of self sacrifice. We find out later in the film that they are all in on the joke but who cares. Supposedly nobody dies and they are all hiding in District 13 Oh those triskaidekaphobes. as opposed to District 9 which may have been more entertaining. The acting is good and outside of the plastic elite roles characters evolve to a degree. Actually the characters do not develop in a sense but do coalesce due to extreme hardship. Supposedly they will all have to kill to survive but it sort of works if you don't pay too much attention. Katniss as Xena warrior princess kind of works but Xena in a transforming wedding dress? Is she Xena or Kantmiss? The fake marriage theme just doesn't work if Snow and company are trying to kill her off. Now she's also the victim of a pregnancy which must be immaculate because there is no sex in this movie. But it is all a lie to get support for her plight from the populace that isn't so downtrodden that they can actually send help to someone else. What? Now instead of individual protagonists we have couples and these couples are past winners of the Hunger Games. I thought when you won the first time you were set for life and your district was favored? What happened to that plot line? When did the couples start winning the stupid games? Supposedly there's only been seven gavels with one winner each so where do we get 24? Fierce couples they are too. These are some really bad ass pairs who drop like paper tigers and operate like unintelligent zombies. At least the first crew were all thinking people and the games worked out in a way.

	onyx:emotionText "Spoiler Alert. Enjoy the movie first if you don't want to be sullied by another's opinion. First there is another movie in the wings and given the boffo box office of this meager effort will make millions more. Let's see how can we take a formula alter it slightly and still keep the same thing? Make a sequel to The Hunger Games and call it Catching Fire. We have a subplot involving the revolution that we thought was set off in the first movie. Obviously it wasn't but with Katniss' providing the impetus rebellious elements are at work in this movie. One is reminded of the Matrix.In normal human existence those that benefit give enough to those who don't so there will not be a revolution. Here nothing is given back but propaganda. Kind of reminds me of the current American administration but that's not for this post. It's all so formulaic and predictable. The whole goal is to get the Whole World to hate Katniss Let the floggings begin while showing Katniss in a wedding dress. Starve the people while showing Katniss at an elaborate dinner. This let them eat cake motive just doesn't work. Potboilers are not new. Sinclair Lewis wrote Kingsblood Royal and it was a potboiler par excellence. But a potboiler inside a potboiler just gilds the Lily. Why? Here's my opinion inside of an opinion There is simply not enough material to make three good movies but we want to stretch the franchise. So let's stretch the first concept from a pretty well done movie and see how much we can make without much effort. That what the producers must have been thinking. And make a fortune they did while elevating JenLaw into international stardom. We know that our heroine will not be killed so this movie just drags through The Perils of Pauline but with supporting actors who do a good job of self sacrifice. We find out later in the film that they are all in on the joke but who cares. Supposedly nobody dies and they are all hiding in District 13 Oh those triskaidekaphobes. as opposed to District 9 which may have been more entertaining. The acting is good and outside of the plastic elite roles characters evolve to a degree. Actually the characters do not develop in a sense but do coalesce due to extreme hardship. Supposedly they will all have to kill to survive but it sort of works if you don't pay too much attention. Katniss as Xena warrior princess kind of works but Xena in a transforming wedding dress? Is she Xena or Kantmiss? The fake marriage theme just doesn't work if Snow and company are trying to kill her off. Now she's also the victim of a pregnancy which must be immaculate because there is no sex in this movie. But it is all a lie to get support for her plight from the populace that isn't so downtrodden that they can actually send help to someone else. What? Now instead of individual protagonists we have couples and these couples are past winners of the Hunger Games. I thought when you won the first time you were set for life and your district was favored? What happened to that plot line? When did the couples start winning the stupid games? Supposedly there's only been seven gavels with one winner each so where do we get 24? Fierce couples they are too. These are some really bad ass pairs who drop like paper tigers and operate like unintelligent zombies. At least the first crew were all thinking people and the games worked out in a way. But here they face much stiffer competition from the environment that they ever do from any other person. The Mandrills are real imagined? The mocking birds are realunreal? When is a bite a bite and imagination can kill you if this were a Fringe episode where people were attacked by imaginary steel butterflies.

It was basically just Peeta Katnis and their allies running away from whatever thing Snow sent to kill them instead of the other people. Second we never really got to know any of the other tributes. Towards the end they kept saying that these two people were still out there and I just kept asking myself who are these people. You never knew who the real threats were in the competition. Finally the ending was horrible. My brother looked at me and asked if it was over and all I could say was i don't know. People say that it was a cliff hanger. It was not. They tell you where the important people are and what the Capitol did. The only positive i found in the movie was the acting. As always Jennifer Lawrence was amazing as well as everyone else.".

The books are boring and disgusting garbage so one day I watched the film to see if there was any improvement... nope not a bit. It was just a melodramatic rather uglylooking girl murdering other kids for an hour. The movie should be titled Two hours of my life I'll never get back.Now my sister told me to see the sequel saying it was an amazing actionpacked film... it was just as bad as the first and they did a horrible cover of Everybody Wants to Rule the World by Tears for Fears how could they use such an amazing song and associate it with this load of crud? If you like the dystopian genre try Soylent Green that's a much better movie with a real story and a truly amazing film. I had a nice big bonfire last week and burned all the DVD's and books of this pathetic franchise I could find now that's 'catching fire'! It's an extremely overrated series not very good and I honestly wouldn't watch it again or read it if you payed me! Don't waste your time with this garbage it really isn't worth it. Most of the sheep who love this series will look back later in life and say what the heck did I like this series for? I mean sure you've gotta give the production company credit for drawing in such an audience for poor suckers who think this scifi Twilight repeat is some beautiful and romantic masterpiece but still... and going back and reading the positive reviews it made me very worried for society. Some reviews call it the best film of 2013 the most sad romantic and heartpumping movie I've ever seen! SERIOUSLY!? The acting was terrible the soundtrack boring the plot unoriginal frankly overall I'd much rather perform selfsurgery than have to watch this load of crud ever again! Not to sound rude but it was the worst thing I've seen in a long time if you rated Catching Fire higher than a 510 I pity you.".

In parallel to that there is also a story of a genetic researcher whose four year old daughter has just died. How do these stories tie together? That is what makes the movie so intriguing. The story structure is such that the lead detective Erlunder played compellingly by Ingvar E. Sigursson must investigate a crime from 30 years ago in order to solve the murder he's got on his hands now. Surprisingly this is done with a bare minimum of flashbacks I counted two neither of which are to the original girl's death. The director Baltasar Kormkur sets a dreary tone using a muted color palette and wide shots of bleak terrain surrounding the city. The stark architecture only adds to this feeling of despair. A side story of Erlendur's relationship with his drug addicted daughter adds depth to the overall story by fleshing out the point of view character. This is by no means an amazing film but it is very good. The supporting characters don't stand out much but rather seem to be foils for Erlendur to play off of. This was apparently based on one of a series of crime novels and I'd be very interested to see adaptations of the others if the story quality is as consistent as this one.".

Against this background Erlendur doggedly untangles the connections and the crimes of the past digging up corpses and secrets shameful or tragic. Landscape and society alike are revealed and commented on drily and laconically.Being based on a novel by Iceland's most successful crime writer the characters are as well known to the home audience as Rebus for instance is in Britain and carry enough of the baggage of real life to make them credible and sympathetic. There are visual themes of burials and exhumations postmortems pathology labs and fast food and a sound track of male voices shading into electronic moans and growls which in turn dissolve into the wind. It's a very wellconstructed package which is thought provoking gruesome touching and funny and it's certainly worth seeing.".

The officer is also trying to balance all of this while dealing with his own drug addicted daughter who is always trying to cage money off of her dad.

The film also makes good use of some black humour. As this film has no U.S. distributionit will be a bit of a chore finding a cinema that screens quality films like this.

The press immediately started a sort of a Scarlett O'Hara search in terms of finding an actor capable of portraying detective inspector Erlendur. When Ingvar Sigursson was finally chosen I must admit that I wasn't that keen as I felt that he was not at all the right type. Having seen the film now I must admit that I need not have worried. Ingvar Sigursson's portrayal of Erlendur is first class throughout both the bitter and tender aspects of that complex character. All the cast is indeed great most notable though Atli Rafn Sigursson as the grieving father gsta Eva Erlendsdttir as Eva Lind Bjrn Hlynur Haraldsson and lafa Hrnn Jnsdttir as Erlendur's associates Sigurur li and Elnborg and Thedr Jlusson as the veteran hooligan Ellii. The cinematography is the best I've seen in any Icelandic film the editing par excellence and the music extremely powerful. One has to give credit to the Reykjavik Police Choir for the excellent singing. This is a film that everyone has to see and I'm quite certain that it will scoop up quite a few awards at various film festivals. Keep on at it Baltasar. And hopefully you will bring other novels by Arnaldur Indriason such as Grafargn and Rddin to the silver screen.".

	schema:reviewBody "An intelligent engaging multilayered storyline that blends strained family relations unsolved murders and infuses some Icelandic customs keeping the viewer captivated from beginning to end. Despite the lack of shock value the film maintains a consistent sense of suspense throughout. Jar City is chilly and cerebral but also morbidly and powerfully alive.In 1974 a young Icelandic girl dies at the hands of a murderer and the crime was never solved. In present day the aged and exhausted detective Erlendur begins to investigate a link between that notorious unsolved crime and the unrelated homicide of a local criminal years after the fact. Erlendur has a difficult private life his wife has passed away and he has a pregnant daughter Eva Lind Agusta Eva Erlendsdottir who is a drug addict and roams the streets.Meanwhile rn Atli Rafn Sigurdarson an employee at a DNAmapping lab struggles with the death of his own daughter who suffered from a brain tumor. In time the two men's lives will intersect in a myriad of ways that neither can even begin to foresee  and the motivation for Holberg's original crime will become resoundingly clear.Director Baltasar Kormkur elegantly churns out a firstrate mystery by dressing it with organic cinematography and a score reminiscent of eerie Gregorian chants. But his best move is a focus on an unlikely secondary character  Iceland itself. He wisely employs this unique almost otherworldly qualities of its settingpresented as both beautiful and threatening. The cinematography is simply stunning truly enhancing the ambiance to an ominous storyline and landscape.Jar City turns out to be intricate haunting puzzle of motivations. The murder of an old man named Holberg opens up a nest of older crimes and brooding secrets. Erlendur finds himself investigating a possible rape from 30 years before and unraveling a tangled history of police corruption and petty brutality. What it all has to do with Holberg is no more clear to the audience than it is to the detective. But Erlendur's combination of bluntness and analytical acumen informs Mr. Kormkur's storytelling technique making Jar City an unusually forceful and thoughtprovoking thriller. Jar City or Mrin is adapted from Icelandic writer Arnaldur Indridason's 2000 bestseller Tainted Blood.".

	schema:headline " An Icelandic mystery";
	schema:reviewBody "As this film opens we see rn a father singing a lullaby to Kola his dying young daughter in hospital we then see two boys entering a house where they find a body. The man is named Holberg and the only obvious lead is a photograph of the grave of another young girl this one who died in 1974. Erlendur is the police officer in charge of discovering who killed Holberg and before the case is solved he will have to discover what happened in 1974 as he does so he will come across police corruption an old undiscovered murder and a possible rape where the victim is unknown. It will also take him to 'Jar City' the storage place for preserved body parts where the evidence linking the deaths of the two girls is to be found they may have died of natural causes but that doesn't stop it being a motive for murder.If you are looking for something jolly then this isn't for you the case is as bleak as the harsh winter scenery. It is still an entertaining story that should keep fans of Scandinavian mysteries happy. Ingvar Sigursson does a fine job as the downbeat Erlendur a character who is tougher than he looks and has a taste for sheep's heads! As is often the case there is more to the story than the mystery all cops these days seem to have difficult home lives and Erlendur is no exception he has problems with his daughter who has an unstable life to say the least".

	schema:headline " TVstyle procedural will delight mavens but should carry a few health warnings";
	schema:reviewBody "My perception of this movie is that it is essentially a feature length pilot episode for a TV series. It reminds me particularly of the British remake of the TV series Wallander starring Kenneth Brannagh. People interviewed by the police are hardy and often as bitter as the weather the lead investigator has huge family problems investigations invariably lead to cruelties of the distant past and the plotting is labyrinthine with strange occurrences and subplots making sense only at the end. Both have excellent cinematography. Indeed the plotting of Jar City is extraordinarily reminiscent of many standard UK or US crime series. Effectively you could take the plots of any of the episodes of Touch of Frost and transplant them on top of the bleak locale in this movie and have an effective sequel.The script couldn't be more obviously from the cookie cutter if it was starshaped and had sprinkles it contains even the most familiar of motifs such as the folly of the lead investigator going to the local prison to interview a manipulative and dangerous psychopath who inevitably explodes at the end of the interview. I'm absolutely convinced that this is scones and jam for many folk but I feel it needs pointing out to people like myself who do not go to the cinema to watch televisuallycrafted entertainment. What I felt a keen lack of was message. Jar City takes as its theme the genetic studies in Iceland. Icelanders in genetic terms have remained largely isolated from the outside world presenting a great opportunity for scientists to study their genetics. Lots of information concerning the heredity of the population has been kept and many genetic diseases unique to Iceland can be traced effectively in a population that has refrained from interbreeding and is remarkably genetically homogeneous it's like trying to put together a jigsaw puzzle of the London underground map instead of a jigsaw puzzle of a field of daisies. A company called deCODE genetics attempted to set up a database carrying all the genetic and hereditary information for the entire population of Iceland. Due to privacy concerns this project was terminated and at the end of last year deCODE genetics went bankrupt in Iceland. The episode is a rich topic for debate. But in this movie genetics and medical science are not there for education's sake they're there for weird atmosphere.For gross out fans Jar City offers interest it's a grisly movie there's often a morbid focus on food to accompany events for example a coroner who eats lunch between incisions. The most queasy part for me was when Inspector Erlendur devours a sheep's head obtained strangely enough from a drive through. Unfortunately the gross out content occasionally became farcical the movie attempts the rather delicate task of mixing the grisly with the sentimental and ended up providing unintentional humour towards the end. This is the equivalent in cinematic terms of attempting to prepare fugu if you're not wellqualified deft of hand and sharp of eye you poison the client. This rather novice director should have lowered the tariff on his performance.I walked out of this dour overcast movie feeling rather bad about myself and about life in general. Not one to see alone on a bad day.".

At the same time a genetic researcher rn Atli Rafn Sigursson suffering from grief of the death of his young daughter researches the family trees of people to find the source of the genetic disorder that killed her.Under the direction of Baltasar Kormkur Jar City is a dark complex film with a multilayered plot. Throughout the film Kormakur keeps a sombre tone using natural light whenever possible and used the baron landscape of Iceland to great effect. Kormakur when he needed to slow the film down to allow the actors to show their characters and speed up the investigation when he needs to. He keeps the film feeling natural looking at tragedy like the death of a child in a sensitive and sad manner. The film was realistic with neither heroes or villains being typical characters and Kormakur does not cut any corners like a chase in a swamp. He uses handheld cameras and an operatic score to add to his emotional power of the film.With Indriason writing the script Kormakur make a tort film fitting a complex plot effectively in a short running time. Admittedly some of the subplots seems to be shorten with rn's investigation being overlooked but we still get to see the buck of the story.There is also excellent performances in the film with Ingvar E. Sigursson particularly worthy of note in the lead role playing a skilled investigator with a lot of personal baggage suffering from moments of kindness and ruthlessness. Atli Rafn Sigursson too was very good and had a touching scene early in the film with his dying daughter. Erlendsdttir also gave a grounded performance as a woman trying fight a drug addiction and reconnect her father.A very worthy film great for anyone who loves crimes thrillers.".

At first the timing of both narratives is unclear but the flashbacks are noticeably of the past. That was the main issue I had with the film. But the end ties everything together and only in the second half will you begin to understand what is really going on. It is also complex in that it deals with some of the more complicating aspects of human nature  family love lust and death. However the film does do a good job of creating a mystery which makes it a pretty good crime film. It seems like the clues they find don't really lead anywhere but bit by bit the pieces start to fit together and each clue leads to the next. The film feels slow and stagnant at times but is pretty enjoyable.The acting is also pretty good though of course there is the cultural difference to consider with regards to the characters. Though they can be related to come characters from the normal western detective film the characters do have a sense of locality. The film introduces quite a lot of characters but we do not get to know them in depth. For the sake of this show however it works as the story is rather complex and needs to establish relations between many characters.The overall mood of the film is pretty heavy and it seems like something bad might happen any second. It gives an eerie feel at times and the vast landscape shots hint at isolation and despair.Read more movie reviews at championangels.wordpress.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Unremittingly depressing Icelandic crime story everything about it is miserable the palette of colours the settings the scenery the people the food  definitely not sponsored by the Iceland Tourist Board. Jar City makes 'Wallander' the Swedish version look like Miami Vice  not a Faroe Island jumper in sight. The plot follows Ingvar Eggert Sigursson's hardbitten cop Erlendur on a murder investigation that leads into the past. There are good performances here and solid direction by Baltasar Kormkur who has just completed 'Contraband' as of late 2011 directing Mark Wahlberg Giovanni Ribisi and Kate Beckinsale.There are some mechanical difficulties like certain sections of flashback which are hard to pick up because there is no visual distinction between with the main action and the subtitles are too fast in places with no obvious reason. But if you like your cops gritty your stories grimy and your locations grey and inhospitable then you will probably enjoy this. Ultimately it is in the same territory as the likes of 'Spiral' and 'The Killing' and the story perhaps suffers a bit from not having the same amount of time as these for the viewer to become immersed in the detail but Jar City is a good film and well worth the rental if you are looking for a gloomy thriller.".

The people there and in Iceland live a different life they are very very hardy. Livestock sometimes lives in your garage or living room depending on your preference. But murder still exists and the rural murders can be most complicating because many of the killers have lived with centuries of inbreeding which can cause severe deviant behavior.

One looks in vain if not desperation for a sliver of colour to temper the drabness. Neither is anyone having much fun so that a break in Siberia would be a step upwards.

	schema:reviewBody "Daniel Barbers disturbing vision of life on a South London Council estate was filmed in and around the Elephant and castle where leading man Michael Caine actually spent his formative years.As the film's protagonist the titular Harry Brown Caine plays a retired exmarine who loses his wife to illness in the opening stage of the film. Clinging to his old moral values disciplined and always wearing a tie he is an example of the post war generation who are becoming fewer and fewer on the estate. His only enjoyment seems to be having a drink and a game of chess in his local pub with his friend Leonard. When Leonard reacts to the increasing violence on the estate by confronting the gang responsible he is brutally murdered. Harry is informed by the police of this incident and it hurts him terribly telling the police that they are powerless to do anything about it. Slowly and almost imperceptibly Harry snaps and decides that he is going to sort it out the old fashioned way.It is obvious that this film owes much to Michael Winners Death Wish 1974 but this story is so much more bleak and depressing. The young actors who play the gang members are so realistic that they are uncomfortable to watch. The story shows you failings in society at every level and a police division run by a superintendent who is content to put up token resistance and little else. Harry Brown does what most people would like to do deep down inside and take the fight to the criminals.Michael Caine does a great job of getting the best out of a poor script that doesn't give enough dialogue to flesh out the characters properly. He makes the transition from pensioner to vigilante credibly and without becoming a totally different character. The limited sets add an effective touch of claustrophobia but I found the unrelenting depictions of sleaze and urban decay a bit tough to take. There are some very uncomfortable scenes of drug use and violence also particularly the climactic shoot out in the pub. The supporting cast are competent enough with Ben Drew standing out in his role as the particularly nasty young scum bag Noel . Emily Mortimer as DI Frampton is fairly inert and has only one facial expression and a vague attitude throughout the whole film which puts you off feeling much for her character.Harry Brown is not a pleasant film to watch but it is certainly an experience which will pull on every one of your your emotions and is impossible to ignore.".

Showing his routine of walking to the hospital to visit his very ill wife having to walk a long way round to avoid confrontation with an unseen group of youths who use an underpass as their base and his meetings with his old friend and chess partner Lenny in the estate pub. There aren't many other people walking about the estate even in daylight out of fear of the guncarrying teenage gangs.Michael Caine's performance as Harry Brown is wonderful. His timing is spoton. Credit to director Daniel Barber for allowing him space to breathe and not be hurried. In fact the overall pacing is excellent. There is good use of the soundtrack with the lack of intrusive music adding to the reality feel of the film. The night scenes are beautifully lit as well with a good balance between just enough to see what's going on and making the lighting realistic the night scene in the pub with the lights out for instance.This film has been compared to 'Death Wish' and 'Gran Torino' but those films haven't got this film's bleak realistic look at how life is in these areas. There always remains a sense of watching a film of entertainment of it being 'Hollywood'. This is a lot more down to earth. This film has more in common with Mike Leigh's TV drama 'Meantime' and with 'Gomorra'. This isn't an easy 'firstdate' film but it is a superior Brit film one of the best for many years. I'm glad to see that it has got some marketing push behind it and has generated column inches talking about the subject of these 'nogo' areas and society in general.Shocking and brilliant.".

	schema:headline " Solid film that needed more in the way of intelligence and comment in the script";
	schema:reviewBody "I was at a recent Chase  Status gig feeling old and a bit out of place when they did a track featuring Plan B which had the video projected onto the back of the stage. The video included clips from Harry Brown and it reminded me this film existed since it has slipped away in my mind. So back in my mind I decided to watch it despite only having heard soso things about it. The end result of this was for me to have those soso things confirmed because it is a film that kindof does a job in terms of being a solid watch but at the same time doesn't really perform any other function or have anything specific to make it particularly worth seeing.The plot in a nutshell is that a pensioner seeks revenge on the drug gangs running his estate when they kill a friend of his. So essentially we are in Death Wish territory although I was curious to see if the film celebrated vigilante violence whether it condemned it or whether it used the thriller plot to make comments on the state of modern Britain and such forgotten estates. Strangely it doesn't really do any of these and mostly it just plays as a straight thriller. As such it is perfectly watchable with excessive violence some tense scenes and a generally well created world of a police nogo area. It is not brilliant by any means but it is fine for what it is. It does all get overblown towards the end and I found it a little too over the top to take seriously but it is what it is.The lack of anything else going on was a problem for me though. It wasn't that I needed it to take a stand on anything I just wanted it to be a bit smarter and more interesting than it was. The film doesn't have much to say about anything though not about society not about crime not about policing and not about justice. Of course the film doesn't owe me anything like that nor does it have to have any comment when it is content to just be a drama  it just needed to be a better more engaging drama to make up for it.Caine is the main appeal and he does hold the screen in this role. His performance is good and it did make me wish the material had given him more to work with in terms of substance. He is a great presence but he is lost in the overblown final third and really deserved a tighter focus on his character. Mortimer has little to do other than be the face of the powerless police while the majority of the cast turn in rather easy gangster youth performances although the main ones do have a bit more about them than that. Plan B has done this sort of thing before and he is OK but his character is too simple  compared to the content of his first album it is far too one dimensional but he is solid enough doing it.Overall Harry Brown is a decent enough film as a basic dramathriller. It is enjoyably mean even if it does just what you expect this sort of story to do. I would have liked at least something in the way of comment or intelligence in the material though but if it is there it doesn't come through. Not only would this have made the film better but it would have been good for the cast as well. Solid but no more than that.".

So back in my mind I decided to watch it despite only having heard soso things about it. The end result of this was for me to have those soso things confirmed because it is a film that kindof does a job in terms of being a solid watch but at the same time doesn't really perform any other function or have anything specific to make it particularly worth seeing.The plot in a nutshell is that a pensioner seeks revenge on the drug gangs running his estate when they kill a friend of his. So essentially we are in Death Wish territory although I was curious to see if the film celebrated vigilante violence whether it condemned it or whether it used the thriller plot to make comments on the state of modern Britain and such forgotten estates. Strangely it doesn't really do any of these and mostly it just plays as a straight thriller. As such it is perfectly watchable with excessive violence some tense scenes and a generally well created world of a police nogo area. It is not brilliant by any means but it is fine for what it is. It does all get overblown towards the end and I found it a little too over the top to take seriously but it is what it is.The lack of anything else going on was a problem for me though. It wasn't that I needed it to take a stand on anything I just wanted it to be a bit smarter and more interesting than it was. The film doesn't have much to say about anything though not about society not about crime not about policing and not about justice. Of course the film doesn't owe me anything like that nor does it have to have any comment when it is content to just be a drama  it just needed to be a better more engaging drama to make up for it.Caine is the main appeal and he does hold the screen in this role. His performance is good and it did make me wish the material had given him more to work with in terms of substance. He is a great presence but he is lost in the overblown final third and really deserved a tighter focus on his character. Mortimer has little to do other than be the face of the powerless police while the majority of the cast turn in rather easy gangster youth performances although the main ones do have a bit more about them than that. Plan B has done this sort of thing before and he is OK but his character is too simple  compared to the content of his first album it is far too one dimensional but he is solid enough doing it.Overall Harry Brown is a decent enough film as a basic dramathriller. It is enjoyably mean even if it does just what you expect this sort of story to do. I would have liked at least something in the way of comment or intelligence in the material though but if it is there it doesn't come through. Not only would this have made the film better but it would have been good for the cast as well. Solid but no more than that.";

Possibly the best movie Michael Caine has ever been a part of.The director does a truly awesome job of portraying his world with convincing and seedy squalour almost leaving the viewer feeling soiled by the experience. His characters aren't just overtly filthy scum  they're real and believable scum.Michael's character shines.The are no violent rapemurder scenes where his family die at the hands of an outlaw biker gang no terrorists holding his wife to ransom... just an old boy who has seen too many recent horrors to suffer the indignity of it any more.From a drunken moment where his old military reflexes kick in with shocking consequence to the understated twist of a finale you can't help but feel for this man and see good cause for his actions. He's every bit the tired old serviceman whose plight tugs on every decent fibre until you find yourself snapping along with him.He's no Rambo no bulletdodging arsekicker on a rampage of revenge and the action manages to paint well within the lines of plausibility. He ambles into the role with dignity  even if he's moving far too well for someone in his condition emphazema doesn't just kick in after a ten foot jog  it's not asthma and the impact of his losses is portrayed with a hopeless sadness that rather makes you want to hug the poor soul than scream revenge.I enjoyed this movie rather more than I expected to and I would highly recommend it. It's neatly understated with the right blend of pace and action. There's never any risk of failing to 'get it'  the director easily renders the various elements of the story in the light he chooses making a few select points without hammering them home with a cricket bat his Police are ineffectual bureaucrats his protagonist is just an old man and his scum... well I feel like I've lived with them all my life.Oh yeah I have.A truly entertaining and captivating film that's quintessentially British.

A new angle of view to the 90s' popular crime genre since Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs1992 and Danny Boyle's Trainspotting1996... Essentially this movie suggests what can be done with streets when an old chap who has a medalofhonor in naval forces is left alone in his small apartment. It offers an excellent concept through aged Harry Brown's point of view which is as good as the past summer's animation hit Up.It's obvious that the film draws huge benefit from its thematic values. First Harry Brown's wife passes away due to geriatric causes. Then his close friend and neighbour Leonard Atwoll gets killed by rounder juveniles at a night time. Whilst having a lifetime crisis police come to his door for investigation of Atwoll's murdering. Under a confusion of fear anger and despair all of a sudden he finds himself running after the vengeance of his friend Atwoll. Keeping track of the street gangs he lays a trap to show up as a businessman trading guns with them. Since it's Michael Caine as we know him he is an expert at fooling people with detracting their attention so by courtesy of his timing skills and luck he dishes those young criminals one by one.Above all Daniel Barber as a director turns this such a runofthemill plot into a great suspensethriller story. He tries to prove that Harry Brown's first murder was unwillingly just an accident but his last was a psychopathic mincing! Same idea here as the way Brown removing the traces behind him starts with cleaning and collecting garbage then turns out to setting fire and sabotaging locations. Besides characterization is at its best. The criminals were so factual. As an important technical detail the sounds have been captured marvellously with the echoes of fired bullets being heard behind windows and this is what makes a crime movie makes sense. Crimesuspensethriller genre is getting better and better year after year. While we still see a lot of underdeveloped action and shallow crime movies all around it's obvious that Harry Brown is noteworthy and a must see for the genre followers.".

If I'd have seen this film beforehand I'd not have gone within a mile of the area never mind into its seedy interior.Apparently Michael Caine is from The Elephant so this was probably quite a nostalgic road trip for him. In the movie he plays a vigilante gradually becoming more and more determined to avenge the brutal murder of his old mate fast on the heels of his wife's death at the hands of a bunch of local scum who terrorise the neighbourhood.This is no ordinary vigilante movie and although I haven't seen it it must bear considerable comparison to Grand Torino where another fine actor in his latter years dominates a movie.The casting is wonderful and the thugs that terrify the local community are entirely believable. But from start to finish this is Caine's movie. He plays his part with massive pathos. We feel deeply sorry for him as first his wife and then his only chum pass away leaving him quietly tormented and then incredibly angry as he learns that his mates death was mockingly filmed on a mobile phone to the accompaniment of raucous laughter.The brutality of this movie is searing and really shocking at times. The riot scene is entirely believable which is difficult to achieve on a low budget but certainly hits the spot. It plays an important central role in undermining the police and showing them off as the useless and uncaring force that director Daniel Barber is keen to establish .Two things make this movie a real stand out Caine and the pacing of the action.It starts brutally slowly and gradually winds up in pace and tension but never to Hollywood proportions. Don't forget that Caine is a pensioner! Amazingly it holds your belief throughout  not an inconsiderable achievement in a genre that tends to become overblown and ridiculous.I expect Michael Caine will get a BAFTA nomination for this at the very least. He might even win because his performance is stunning. I certainly hope so.His best performance? Arguably.A great film? Definitely.".

	schema:headline " The Michael Caine Show";
	schema:reviewBody "Harry Brown is a pensioner and former Marine living in a very rundown apartment complex or is it flat in the urban quarter of London. It's a crappy place to be kids ling their drugs and guns and beat up those who happen to venture just a little far out into the path. One of those is Harry's friend Leonard Atwell who tries to defend himself against the scum on the streets and winds up stabbed with his own knife. Brown is distraught over this already he's been all alone since his wife just died and a daughter died many years before perhaps during childbirth or as a child and knows the cops won't do much about it despite doing some investigations. So Brown takes his skills as a former Marine before facing off against the Northern Irish years before and uses it to exact payback.Immediately moviegoers will flash to Gran Torino as a story of a lonely grumpy old man mixing it up with gangbangers in a part of town he should have moved out of. But it actually owes more to Taxi Driver in some part an exMarine wiping the scum off the streets and of course Charles Bronson in Death Wish. But as Michael Caine points out in interviews there was a certain underlying joy Bronson had with his character of Paul Kersey in the Death Wish movies even in the first one which was most gritty. This film about the horror of gang violence and drugs and prostitution as an everyday occurrence really hits the spot far better than the shots of gangbangers in Eastwood's film. In fact I would go as far as to say Harry Brown trumps Gran Torino in the department of being about something Torino about racism Brown about vigilantism.And at the center of a film directed with an artful patient eye by newcomer Daniel Barber and written with wisdom and tough attitude when it needs to be by Gary Young is Michael Caine's performance. He's so good in a film like this because we believe this is Harry Brown or what he might be like and we can see ourselves in a part of Brown due to Caine's sympathy or even empathy with the character. This is a man of reserve but also resolve and when he takes to the streets it's because it's really a last resort a kind of fight for survival as well as revenge and Caine doesn't hold back when Brown needs to shed some tears or to have that fierceness in his eyes against these young punks. One such scene which I'll not soon forget is after he plugs a bullet into the gut of a junkie dumbass who tries to pull a gun on Brown as he's purchasing a few weapons and tells a story about a fellow officer he was fighting alongside who had to die in the trenches because of a lack of medical care.It's one of the best scenes I've ever seen with Caine in it and overall the film provides him the opportunity for another piece of superb work. Less remarkable though still decent is Emily Mortimer who provides some sensitivity but also is a little soft in a way for the character of a nononsense detective hot on the heels of the Atwellyoungpunks case in some scenes frankly I just didn't buy her as a detective. But this is so small a flaw that it's hard to judge the film against it. Harry Brown takes its subject matter by the throat treats it cinematically with care and when it's violent you get shaken up and when Brown is in the shadows one suddenly wonders why Caine didn't play Batman in Nolan's movies. A serious nearclassic on street violence and revenge. 9.510".

	schema:reviewBody "I can't deny the highly authentic and strong performances in this film particularly that of Michael Caine. But I have to vouch against some of the reviews written for this film.Its typical how some have praised this film with anger and vitriol venting furious rage at the 'declining state of our society' and the 'ever growing youth crime' in this country. Well maybe that's what the film wanted to want people to feel angry. The papers of course are spilling stories of rampant violent youth crime day after day. Even to the point where the Sun labelled England worse than New York in the 80's. Only in the Sun eh? Wrong you can thank the Daily Mail The Mirror News of the World and any other cheap tabloid to make us all believe in the sensationalistic viewpoint that with live in a country overrun with murderous chavs. Well I don't. And I bet other reviewers are just repeating what they see when they turn on Sky news each morning.There is crime always present I am not naive. Violent crime has been around in Britain for decades stretching way back gangs have always been around apathetic youth have always been around it just comes with a different face and attitude with each decade that passes that's all. The way I see it violent youths aren't getting worse the papers are being more dramatic with it. Treating its viewers and readers like saps and unable to report the stories without trying to tapping into either our greatest fears or our moral outrage or worse inflaming it. With so many people watching Harry Brown and other vigilante films alike I'm finding it hard to see a positive review without someone going off about how they believe that this film truly represents the Britain of today as a whole or how they got off watching the evil hoodies get their comeuppance or ranting how the police are utterly useless. There are so much complications regarding the incessant bureaucracy within the police force and the courts and so many complications regarding disillusioned youths their families and upbringings and surroundings to turn them into the feral thugs they are.... but hey why bother trying to think why its like this when we can watch a film that simply encourages and directs our hate on them by watching a lonely desperate old pensioner pump bullets in these kids? You might think I'm going off into a futile rant while thinking its just a film made for entertainment and nothing else. Well it didn't entertain me as so much as leave a sour taste on my mouth by the time I left the cinema by showing some of the nastiest character ever seen on screen. Screenwriter Gary Young has really pulled off making these lowlife scum about as contemptible as you can get. Each scene is colour drained and murky enough to give that real sense of bleak hopelessness to flood over the audience. It doesn't so much give a sense of gritty realism as so much as realism perceived by Prozac addicts. And as for the whole just a film aspect Harry Brown tries to be social commentary and is none too subtle about it either making several negative characterisations at the police with their ambivalent behaviour and blatant incompetence towards each situation portrayed in the film  Emily Mortimer gives a truly flat wet performance and Charles Creed Miles gives his copper such a common vacantminded role that even cynics of the law would be hardly convinced they're playing accurate police officers.The plot structure of Harry Brown isn't original either. It really is a case of beentheredonethat that was seen in Death Wish and The Brave One. You know it starts with the innocent quiet civilian who's friendloved one is savagely murdered mourns their loss purchases a weapon for self defence has their first kill an accidental act of said selfdefence feels sickenedshocked by what they've done but discover they have an act for that sort of violence and continue to hunt and murder thugs each night. You'd think that 35 years after Death Wish came out these filmmakers might have wanted to think of something a little more original? Although Harry Brown is different in that light which Harry's mission is to personally hunt down the thugs who killed his friend for revenge the conclusion is inevitable if not also unbelievable. By throwing in a seemingly random plot twist involving the relationship of the head thug Noel Ben Drew but also climaxing the film in an enormous riot where the police face off against what seems over a hundred psychotic hoodies in ONE small council estate the film by then is now just going way over the top in trying to convince us that we are in a living hell. It also ends with a voiceover narrative of how the actions that happened in this film led to a decrease in violent crime overall in the town as the camera follows Harry Brown down in the underpass. Now it may not glorify violence in general due to the ugly way its portrayed here but it does however not only glorify vigilantism and violent retribution but also tries to justify it too. It is just completely morally bankrupt.But hey at least its not as headsmackingly awful as the 2007 film Outlaw which is at least some small relief.One day hopefully we'll see a vigilanterevenge based film that accurately portrays the REAL society we live in without the extreme perceptions created by sensationalist media or better yet make an example of them and their clear influence on people across the nation and actually nail down the roots of why some of the youths of today are vicious and heartless in the first place. Rather than resorting to our inner fascist fantasies of just wanting to see them die.".

By throwing in a seemingly random plot twist involving the relationship of the head thug Noel Ben Drew but also climaxing the film in an enormous riot where the police face off against what seems over a hundred psychotic hoodies in ONE small council estate the film by then is now just going way over the top in trying to convince us that we are in a living hell. It also ends with a voiceover narrative of how the actions that happened in this film led to a decrease in violent crime overall in the town as the camera follows Harry Brown down in the underpass. Now it may not glorify violence in general due to the ugly way its portrayed here but it does however not only glorify vigilantism and violent retribution but also tries to justify it too. It is just completely morally bankrupt.But hey at least its not as headsmackingly awful as the 2007 film Outlaw which is at least some small relief.One day hopefully we'll see a vigilanterevenge based film that accurately portrays the REAL society we live in without the extreme perceptions created by sensationalist media or better yet make an example of them and their clear influence on people across the nation and actually nail down the roots of why some of the youths of today are vicious and heartless in the first place. Rather than resorting to our inner fascist fantasies of just wanting to see them die.";

The police investigation scenes lack the sharpness and immediacy of the estate scenes. And the revelation involving Liam Cunnigham's Sid sets up too neat and stagey a climax  surely an unnecessary twist in an otherwise brutally flat narrative fabric.

	schema:reviewBody "This was released at the tailend of 2009 with a lot of fanfare and Michael Caine made some headlines himself with passionate and unfashionable views that the education system and poor parenting skills were responsible for youth crime . Certainly Caine himself knows what it's like spending formative years in deep poverty . He also stated in the 1970s that  The only reason I do a film is if there's exotic filming involved or if the cheque is large enough  . Has Caine mellowed or is HARRY BROWN  a low budget thriller set in a London estate so powerful Caine sees it as a labour of love ? Certainly the omens are good since he's surrounded by a respected supporting cast including Mortimer  Cunningham  Glen and the criminally under rated Sean Harris Harris appeared in OUTLAW in 2007 and that too was a British vigilante thriller . The faults of HB are similar to the ones in Nick Love's film where it's not enough for the anti hero to kill people for merely selling class A drugs  the criminals must also be unrepentant violent sexual predators who gun down unfortunate passerbys for kicks or run child prostitution rings . In 1971 American critics rushed to label DIRTY HARRY  a fascist film  and one wonders if the producers were worried about similar accusations . Everything is a little bit too simplistic . Gary Young's screenplay does tend to overstate how bad the villains are . Unlike OUTLAW the narrative doesn't blame police apathy for soaring violent crime it tends to blame the Crown Prosecution Service . The detectives Frampton and Hicock give the film some soul but they never entirely convince . Does it seem credible that the death of a senior citizen at the hands of a gang would result in manslaughter charges than murder ? It's also implausible that during a police interview a suspect would state  I'll give you unnatural sex and you'll enjoy it you saucy minx   Paraphrase  without a lawyer intervening . The narrative shoots itself in the foot in the last 15 minutes that'll have you gasping  yeah right  Director Daniel Barber does rise above the material and he's a director to keep an eye on . He's very much in a post modernist tradition . Harry enters a skunk factory and the diagetic muzak is similar to the opening soundtrack of Gasper Noe's IRREVERSIBLE whilst an ad hoc interrogation involving Harry and a junkie resembles  that scene  from CASINO ROYALE . Barber also makes good use of sound especially gunfire and when violence does happen it's sometimes genuinely shocking . Caine comes across as an older slightly more mellow version of Jack Carter and dominates the film but this is not to take away anything from the rest of the cast  especially Ben Drew who one hopes to see more of HARRY BROWN did suffer slightly in that it started some debate bout youth crime which drowned out the movie itself . It is a very impressive gritty thriller that we see the British industry produce very little of. It does suffer some flaws in the screenplay which unfortunately spoils the ending and doesn't make the film as persuasive as it thinks it is but there's far worse films than this being produced in Britain over the last few years".

Both stories are supported by magnificent senior actors living in equivalent environments ruled by gangs of hoodlums.

Michael Caine has an awesome performance in the role of a widower that becomes a vigilante after the murder of his best friend.

Harry Brown is a film that takes on this subject in what was dubbed the British Gran Torino.Harry Brown Michael Caine is a retired Royal Marine living alone on a South London sink estate cursed with youth violence. Gangs run the streets attacking people robbing vehicles shooting guns taking drugs and making live Hell for the residents. His oldest friend Leonard David Bradley can not take it any more and since he had no support from the police he goes to confront the gang and ends up gets killed for his troubles. Harry decides to go on a mission of revenge getting firearms and torturing and killing way to the truth and taking on both a local gang leader Noel Ben DrewPlan B and drug runners. And two CID officers DI Alice Frampton Emily Mortimer and DS Terry Hicock Charlie Creed Miles investigate both the case involving both Leonard's murder and the crimes Harry has committed.Harry Brown was Daniel Barber's feature debut and he shows that he is a very skilled director. He was able make a very compelling fast paced revenge thriller in a gritty urban setting. The violence felt real with shooting being very bloody. Barber did not hold back showing the horrors of this kind of world with innocent people being randomly attacked including shooting a woman pushing a pram though I would have thought the police would put a lot of man power into that investigate. The gang is shown to willing to act sexually to work such as grabbing a woman and pushing their hips towards hers. There are chilling moments like when Noel is with a young girl and tightens her scarf around her neck. Barber uses mobile phone cameras and camcorders for short periods to give an added scene of realism and show what the gangs would have seen. The police raid and riot was also really well make quickly smashing into flats and the whole of the youth of the estate throwing anything they could at the police.Harry Brown is meant to be Michael Caine's last starring role in a film and it was an incredible performance. He was able to show his range and determination in a film about a man who had lost everything and wants to set everything right. Considering the story is pretty standard Caine and Barber did an incredible job. Emily Mortimer is one of those actresses who does give her all in a film and she was interesting as a committed but kind officer who does care about people though some hints about her past would have added a little depth. Ben Drew shows a lot of promise as an actor being a sinister little thug and he was truly unlikeable person with a mum who would defence him to hilted. Bradley was able very believable as a man who had suffered for a long time and it really did look like he was a long time friend of Harry.Whilst overall the film is excellent some elements of the plot reminded me the Tom Clancy novel Without Remorse about an exmilitary guy getting revenge against a gang to gain revenge. It follows a similar route of a man killing and torturing way to the true and being as ruthless as possible. This is a film that does a have a right wing tone how the police has failed that people can take justice into their own hands and that the majority of kids living on an estate are violence drug dealers who have fun tormenting people. I do believe it is true that the police can be hopeless dealing with unsocial behaviour thinking it is not worth their time or say they can not do anything say for a lack of evidence there are a number of shock stories in the media about that so Harry Brown does have a valid point there. But this a film that takes all the hoodie stereotypes and pushes them to their extremes I would have thought the police would have taken action because of the violence. Also Harry Brown certainly wanted to make a effort sure the bad guys were as unlikeable as possible like a leading drug running forcing a hoodie to perform oral sex.Overall I personally think Harry Brown is a better film then Gran Torino because Harry took a more proactive route and he nothing to loose. He was a character more willing to use violence and did not have to take on an issue like racism.".

But I didn't regret it watching it and I must even say that I got goosebumps by some scene's. And people who know me do know that I can take the goriest pieces without a problem. But again it is really the reality and the brutality that makes the movie and of course Sir Michael Caine. Admit it he always has something macabre over him but he's now in his 70's 1933and still can deliver the creeps. His acting is surely an Oscar worthy. But also worth mentioning is Sean Harris. he really is believable in fact all hoodies are believable and of course the language used and the dialect gives it also its reality. This is an all points an excellent movie. Not in Rambo or Arnie style with a lot of shooting but just a straight in your face flick big thumbs up to the director Sir Caine and the whole bunch involved.".

	schema:headline " Brilliant Performance Elevates This Film";
	schema:reviewBody "In Harry Brown we have a movie that really does not bring anything new to the typical formula that is found in most revenge thrillers. A guy gets wronged in one way or another and he decides to do something about it vigilante style. We've seen it before many many times. So what do you do when you don't have a whole lot of originality? You get a very good and convincing actor to play the lead role. That's exactly what we get with Brown. The plot is nothing new. The script is decent but nothing spectacular. And the direction never really seems completely sure of itself. But most of that really doesn't matter here. The bottom line is Michael Caine is brilliant. He plays this character in convincing fashion and that is what makes this film much better than it really ought to be. I wouldn't be surprised in the least if he is awarded with an Oscar nomination come early next year. And he really didn't have to do the work completely on his own. The supporting cast is effective albeit not very well developed. Emily Mortimer is especially good as the detective who is willing to put her own life in danger in search of the truth. It should be noted though that the film does unravel a bit during the latter part of the second half and there's a twist at the conclusion that feels a bit forced. However thanks to Caine even those hiccups aren't enough to derail the film entirely. During what I personally believe has been a disappointing summer movie season you could certainly do much worse than Harry Brown.".

	schema:reviewBody "To describe this movie as a vigilante thriller is correct but woefully inadequate because what it also does so well is to portray with some poignancy the sadness and despondency of an old man's life and the helplessness of the residents of an estate which is controlled by gangs who trade in violence and drugs on a daily basis. The presence of a deteriorating council estate a pedestrian underpass which ordinary people have to avoid for their own safety and drug deals being done without any attempt at discretion are all too realistic as are the random outbursts of violence which frequently target those least able to protect themselves young mothers old people etc..Firsttime director Daniel Barber's use of handheld cameras and editing make some of the action sequences very compelling and the considered pacing of the early part of the film is successful in enabling Harry Brown's lifestyle and character to be introduced in a way which is both simple and effective. The atmosphere of the piece is grim bleak and pessimistic and the impressive nighttime scenes play an important part in contributing to the overall mood.Harry Brown Michael Caine is an elderly exmarine who lives a lonely life in a decaying council estate in London. After suffering the loss of his wife who'd been in a coma for some time he plays chess with his best friend Len David Bradley at his local pub. Len tells Harry about the harassment he's been suffering from the youths who post dogdroppings and lit newspapers through his letter box and describes how fearful the experience has made him feel. He shows Harry a bayonet that he carries to protect himself and his desperation has been made worse by the fact that the police are unable to provide him with any form of help or protection. Harry's alarmed by what Len tells him and advises him not to take matters into his own hands.A short time later Detective Alice Frampton Emily Mortimer visits Harry and informs him that Len has been killed by one of the local gangs and then on a second visit adds that it might not be possible to make a murder charge stick because the gang could argue that they acted in selfdefence as Len was carrying his bayonet. The police interview some gang members including their leader Noel Winters Ben Drew but soon have to release them again.Following Len's funeral Harry's threatened at knifepoint by a thug who tries to rob him. In this moment his old marine training kicks in and he kills his assailant. This is a significant turning point because since he'd completed his military service in Northern Ireland Harry had kept his most distasteful memories buried deep inside him. The sudden resurrection of his old skills and instincts then leads to him following a violent course of action to avenge his friend's murder.In a movie that's full of good acting performances the surprise package for most people is Ben Drew better known as Plan B who is brilliant as the detestable gang leader who exemplifies perfectly the way that most people see thugs like Noel Winters. This character's only aspiration is to emulate the notoriety previously achieved by his father. He's also completely devoid of any decency respect or concern for the victims of his actions. Drew who has achieved great success in the past with his soulful Smokeyesque vocals and biting political hip hop offerings has also made forays into screen writing and directing and is clearly an important emerging talent.Emily Mortimer is very credible in her role as a police officer who is sensitive and much more tunedin to what's going on than her superiors. The way in which she conveys the hopelessness and weariness that she feels is quietly powerful and consistent with the overall atmosphere of the film.Michael Caine is incredibly natural and straightforward in the way that he brings to life Harry's innate decency and dignity. He's also very subtle in conveying the anxiety and frustration that Harry feels as well as the resigned way in which he views the pointless violence that only makes the poor conditions on his estate even more desperate.Harry Brown is disturbing tragic and realistic and surely worthy of greater recognition than it's received to date.".

When the police visit Harry one morning to tell him Len has been murdered they aren't sure who is responsible but Harry is and as a former marine sets out to dispense his own form of justice to the lawless delinquents terrorizing the estate.As if any more proof were needed that older actors fail to get very good leading parts Caine hasn't been the lead in anything other than not very mainstream or straight to video stuff for years his most notable recent stuff being as Alfred the Butler in the new Batman films. But he went all out with a relentless publicity campaign for his new film giving countless magazine and press interviews to build up the hype as well as not holding back with his thoughts on the state of modern Britain and how the working classes of which he was once a part have been left to rot on sink estates with no hope of a decent future and crime being seen as their only outlet. And as a result Harry Brown has garnered a nationwide release alongside the bigger special effects packed 2012 with a similar advertising campaign and some pretty good reviews.As others have noted the film pulls no punches and delivers an unflinching nosedive into an area of Britain most people don't want to think about where crime drugs and gangs run rampant and the police either have their hands tied or simply don't care enough to stop it. In the lead role Caine is hard hitting as the worn down old man who's become vulnerable and has had enough but has to revert back to what he learned in his younger days when he comes to feel the law is as powerless as he is. One of the standout scenes is where he visits the home of drug dealer Stretch a wasted Sean Harris and is invited into his squalid depraved existence to score a gun whilst being offered a strung out girl on the side. The scene drags on a bit but perfectly captures the bleak grimy sub culture the film is trying to explore.As for the rest of the cast Ben Drew does a good job as the cold eyed remorseless totally unpleasant gang leader along with Jack O' Connoll as one of his cohorts playing a weaker more victimized young thug here as opposed to his dominating scary lead thug in Eden Lake.A daring bold piece that has a lot to say about some of the nastier parts of British society.

	schema:headline " The best greatest badass action film in the action genre number 1 personal favorite John WooVan Damme film";
	schema:reviewBody "JeanClaude Van Damme is Hard Target one of my personal number 1 action favorite films of all time. Rambo movies and the original 87 Robocop Cobra Predator 1 and 2 Terminator 2 Judgment Day The Terminator John Wick 1 and 2 are my favorite action movies while Hard Target is at top of them and it is my favorite personal action film off all time. This is John Woo's best film in my opinion he made it in the USA. My favorite number 1 JeanClaude Van Damme film his best one. I love the action scenes the gory kills Van Damme with two guns love his line Give it a rest pal and bang bang he shoots the bad guy in the motorcycle suite. Hunting season... is over and he launches grenade in to the bad guy. John Woo directed this film and he directed great.I love John Woo's movies Broken Arrow Hard Boiled Paycheck The Killer those are my favorite action films. Hard Target is really my favorite of the 90's action films and they don't make em these days those kind of action movies today. This is my number 1 John Woo action personal favorite film don't get me wrong I like Hard Boiled but I don't love it like I love Hard Target to death!I watched this movie on VHS I used to had the film on a blank VHS tape and on Blank CD but the CD didn't work properly anymore. I have this film on Bluray disc. I watch it constantly and in 2015 it was my number 1 action film whenever someone asked me which was my favorite film it was Hard Target.Hard Target stars JeanClaude Van Damme Lance Henriksen Arnold Vosloo Yancy Butler Kasi Lemmons and Wilford Brimley.JeanClaude Van Damme is Chance Boudreaux Hard Target an ex US Marine Force Reconnaissance and an outofwork Cajun. He is a badass this is my comic book hero. My favorite action hero of all time he ass kicking everywhere shooting bad guys. Chance launches hundred of bullets and slugs in to thirty bad guys. The stuntman's are absolutely crazy insane  Van Damme stands on a motorcycle while he races back towards in to one of the pursuing SUVs firing his gun at the bad guys than crashes his bike in to SUV vehicle jumping off the bike over the roof of the truck and landing safely behind it crazy badass stunt the stuntman was absolutely insane crazy. He shoots behind with the gun igniting the gas tank and the truck explodes  bad ass scene in to the film. Van Damme jumps with his leg and hit the motorcycle bad guy in to his helmet with his foot the bad guy crashes off his bike awesome. Badass action film with balls if you ask me.You see a heavy automatic machine guns hand guns Beretta 92FS great explosive weapons. One mercenary uses SWDCobray Street Sweeper a grenade launcher and when he fires on Uncle Douvee Wilford Brimley he hits and blows up an entire shed. Shotguns and automatic weapons are used well. Van Damme in his 90's never used two hand guns so well except in Double Impact but not like in this movie. You have motorcycle gunmen with their MP5s automatic guns chasing Chance all over the town. You have an Arrow Stealth with arrow that is been used in the film. A thug uses Arrow Stealth on his prey awesome. You have Uncle Douvee  with a bow and arrow which he kills one of the thugs when he fired an automatic weapon on him. These days action movies don't use bow and arrow in the movies anymore. You have incredible explosions in the movie real fire power guns real practical effects. Real shotguns real weapons are used no CGI they are real stunts used in this film. I absolutely love the filming locations in the film.The plot is about a mercenary Emil Fouchon Lance Henriksen who is recruiting a homeless combat veterans for the sports game to stalk and hunt people for the amusement of the rush and adrenalin on the streets of New Orleans. His clients are multi millionaire bored tycoons who pay a half of million dollars to stalk and kill the most challenging prey of them all. When Chance Van Damme is hired from Natasha Binder Yancy Butler to finding her missing father he finds the game that Binder was killed and now Boudreaux becomes the next target. Boudreaux is an ex US Marine Force Reconnaissance expert in combats and martial artist and he is a Hard Target difficult to kill.I love Emil Fouchon Lance Henriksen in this movie Lance is the best in this movie and he is excellent in his role his best acting ever he is a professional. I love Arnold Vosloo as Pik Van Cleef his best character ever. I know you didn't mean to... hurt... my feelings. Boudreaux Boudreaux Boudreaux. I've been looking all over for you.  I don't get angry I'm a professional.  his best lines ever he is a badass bad guy. Emil Fouchon is a great bad guy but I enjoy Pik Van Cleef more. I love also Wilford Brimley as Uncle Douvee in the film he is great us Chance's uncle.1010 my personal number 1 favorite action film of all time I think it is at top of Rambo and RoboCop  Predator 1 and 2 Terminator 2 Judgment Day The Terminator John Wick 1 and 2 my films this is my film from the 90's and I love it so so so much. I love this film to death I amazingly love it. Also Hard Target 2 doesn't exist for me. I never liked the sequel to the film skip the sequel and watch this one. Highly recommend to the fans.".

I love also Wilford Brimley as Uncle Douvee in the film he is great us Chance's uncle.1010 my personal number 1 favorite action film of all time I think it is at top of Rambo and RoboCop  Predator 1 and 2 Terminator 2 Judgment Day The Terminator John Wick 1 and 2 my films this is my film from the 90's and I love it so so so much. I love this film to death I amazingly love it. Also Hard Target 2 doesn't exist for me. I never liked the sequel to the film skip the sequel and watch this one. Highly recommend to the fans.";

	schema:reviewBody "Hard Target 1993 is one of the greatest and the best action packed movie in a John WooVanDamme Style! Of all Van Damme movies this one of his is the best of Van Damme ever and I absolutely love it to death. Like the title says Don't hunt what you can't kill. It is my John Woo's number 1 personal favorite action flick of all time that I love to death. It is also one one of my personal favorite action films of all time. Don't hunt what you can't kill.The thrill of the hunt. It's the ultimate drug and the more intense the rush the higher the price. International superstar JeanClaude Van Damme teams up with worldfamous action director John Woo for this electrifying thriller Van Damme is the target of an evil mercenary Lance Henriksen who recruits homeless combat veterans for the amusement of his clients  bored tycoons who will pay a half a million dollars to stalk and kill the most challenging prey of them all Man. Laced with dark humor and slampacked with electrifying action Hard Target is a must see for action fans.  Hard Target is not only my John Woo favorite film it is also my JeanClaude Van Damme favorite best action film from my favorite action star. I put this film over Die Hard this is my Die Hard movie. I love that the stunts were realistic I think that John Woo didn't allow Van Damme to make his own stunts and it is a shame that JeanClaude Van Damme beep up his chance with John Woo by making on another film. It is Van Damme's ego fault. Still they don't make movies like this. I heard that there is Driector's cut somewhere on DVD that I have never saw I own this film on Bluray in my John Woo collection and I still love it. The stunts are crazy the action are spectacular. Van Damme catching a snake wow incredible. at one point a movie's typical crazy stuntman firing the Beretta 92FS 9mm while standing on the seat of a motorcycle and crashes in to the car. Still the motorcycle chase sequence is my favorite scene in the film. Van Damme launches thousands of bullets slugs and explosive projectiles into THIRTY of mercenary tycoons baddies. Arnold Vosloo is also underrated actor who plays Pik van Cleef he did a really pretty good job as the villain and Fouchon second mercenary henchman. Possibly best role for him. I don't get angry. I'm a professional. I love this movie the action is delivered perfectly. Honestly I love Arnold Vosloo more in this movie than Lance Henriksen and I love his character Pik van Cleef. The trill of the hunt. It's the ultimate drug and the more intense the rush the higher the price. Hard target was the film is saw as a teen when I was 18 I couldn't saw it as a kid I really don't know it was never on TV and I have never seen a VHS cover in a video store. I didn't even know that movie exists. Hard Target is a 1993 action film that marked the US directorial debut of acclaimed Hong Kong director John Woo who brought out his Asian style of action to Western cinema.1010 for me I love this movie to death It is my number 1 favorite action film.".

People are being shot in the streets but no is ever around in the middle of the day but the killers and victims? Usually that stuff annoys me but I didn't seem to mind in this movie. In fact it fits.Despite the lack of credibility Van Dame standing on top of a speeding motorcycle as it heads towards an onrushing car and later dodging all kinds of pretty neat weapons as he tries to help Yancy Butler is just fun. John Wooddirected films tend to be ridiculously exaggerated and loud so that's what you get. I am not a fan of many of his films but I am of this one. It's pure macho madness with a Lance Henriksen doing what he does best be an incrediblynasty and brutal villain. An added bonus in here  a real hoot  is old man Wilfred Brimley as Van Damme's French uncle who comes to his nephew's aid.Add a great blues soundtrack and you have a great film to feed your male hormones with when needing to be fed some gratuitous violence.".

And the factor behind these? John Woo! John Woo has proven himself the answer on providing greatness to Van Damme and it's obvious that Van Damme's films that followed simply lacked goodness.With Woo on the helm we get to see Van Damme doing those Woo signatureaction like doublegun firing action slowmo dangerous stunts revealing views and the backtoback 2 side camera view...you name it. Van Damme himself said that this was the most creative action film he's ever done and you'll see why.Regarding the story the plot seemed simple on paper but John Woo added twists and gimmicks to transform the simplicity into interest. The cast is highlighted by Lance Henriksen's role as the bad boss and he adds quality acting and voice to this film. Yancy Butler however does not make a good lead lady here and I always thought of other actresses replacing her.John Woo's action scenes are very defined here and thanks to those slowmo scenes you get to see Van Damme REALLY HIT HIS ENEMIES...as opposed to seeing him move too fast in other films which made you wonder if his kicks were real or not. In addition he did some dangerous stunts on his own which adds authencity to his action figurre. Van Damme needs to team up again with Woo. The films that followed this were simply lacking of quality The Quest or lousy Double Team. It's easy to realize that Hard Target is more of a John Woofilm than a Van Dammefilm. Van Damme in my opinion is betteroff with Woo as director simply because his best is brought out. Since this film is Woo's US debut this film is like a preview of things to come...meaning Broken Arrow FaceOff and the ongoing blockbuster Mission Impossible II! You'll really see how far Woo went from this debut.Definitely worth watching! Hard Target is not John Woo's best but it's Van Damme's best film ever!

It's a sort of updating of 1930's thriller The Most Dangerous Game. It centres around a women searching for  her father in New Orleans who enlists the help of tough cajun chance boudreux i don't wanna say any more about the plot cos i don't wanna give to much away.this is the part of Van Damme's career when his acting wasn't too bad the rest of the cast are mostly a solid bunch of unknowns who prove they've got what it takes to make this a tight well made thriller. Lance Henriksen is great as Fouchon and Arnold Vosloo equally as good as accomplice Van cleef. Even though in my opinion this is Woo's best u.s film it took him 2 more attempts to breakthrough into the Hollywood mainstream in which he finally struck gold with FaceOff. Hard Target comes out a dark action thriller packed with a superb blend of martial arts shootouts and explosions.

	schema:reviewBody "Many people say that this film could be marked down as a cobweb in John Woo's closet. It is far from this but only if you see the full uncencored version which is available in the UK for people who own PAL video machines. I think that this is John Woo's best American made work. Better than Face  Off which was well filmed but lacked the Woo stylised violence to keep your interest up. But Hard Target has plenty. Certain people believe that the end gunfight in the Mardi Gras graveyard is among Woo's best visually. The flurry of quick bloody violence is overwhelmingly adrenaline pumping Van Damme pumps the bad guys with more bullets in 15 minutes than Desperado did in two hours! The American Version is quite mediocre compared to the UK version the US version contains less violence and if you look in the goofs section most of the stuff ups are due to the violence being edited out. I do know where you can get your hands on a rough cut of the 116 minute version but it is a bit of a waste of time due to the fact that there is no colour except a greeny tone and most of the 20 minutes extra are just talking.If you think Van Damme is a bit of a let down he isn't really. He may not be able to act but Woo has made him look as cool as ever seing Van Damme run around with two hand guns is cool This movie runs on Van Dammes precence.Give this film a chance get the UK version for a better time.I give this 5 outta 5.John Woo rules the earth.".

	onyx:emotionText "Many people say that this film could be marked down as a cobweb in John Woo's closet. It is far from this but only if you see the full uncencored version which is available in the UK for people who own PAL video machines. I think that this is John Woo's best American made work. Better than Face  Off which was well filmed but lacked the Woo stylised violence to keep your interest up. But Hard Target has plenty. Certain people believe that the end gunfight in the Mardi Gras graveyard is among Woo's best visually. The flurry of quick bloody violence is overwhelmingly adrenaline pumping Van Damme pumps the bad guys with more bullets in 15 minutes than Desperado did in two hours! The American Version is quite mediocre compared to the UK version the US version contains less violence and if you look in the goofs section most of the stuff ups are due to the violence being edited out.

If you know John Woo than you know that his films spread out the action and put space of acting between them. The acting is not top notch but it is believable. But what makes this movie is the action sequences. They have remnants of Woo's other movies like Broken Arrow Hard Boiled The Killer and the final scene looks like it was plucked straight out of FaceOff. You have to see it to believe it. Van Damme does his normal tough guy not talking much thing but it is great to see him with two pistols in his hands. It's a 7 for total movie but gets a 10 for action. Action movie junkies will love Hard Target. John Woo and Van Damme makes for great action.".

Van Damme is as physically fit as ever. He sports a Kurt Russelstyle hairdo in this movie but his voice is as incoherent as always! His Belgium accent was really hard to understand and it got to my nerves throughout the whole film!!But he busts up the good guys with real finesse. Arnold Vosloo and Lance Henrikson also light up the screen with their sleazy yet very believeable villain performances. The fight and shootout scenes in this film are amazing. Watching Hard Target was really a great experience and it was worth the 2.10 rental! Watch the gunfight behind the wall between Van Damme and Vosloo. It might remind you of a good FaceOff!!".

It was a financial success even though there was the inevitable mixed reviews from critics and today it rightly is held in high regard amongst action movie die hards.OK!

Thank God that he didn't do the camerashot over kill thing with the story and the shootout confrontation scenes in this. But as for this action story I was all for this one! I truly enjoyed all the characters right down to the 'crooked' medical examiner with the stress related nervous cough. The sleazebag o peddler getting homeless to distribute his business sleazoid 900 number pamphlets door to door no less. It won and award and was nominated 5 more times! I liked Chance Boudreaux JeanClaude in this New Oleans feature he really came through. Next to the movie that a late friend of mine wrote TIMECOP 1994 this has got to be the most powerfully enjoyable bangup Van Damme movie that exists I say.The area is questionable and dirty some of it's residents are seedy in operation yet there is a certain beauty that surrounds them in Oleans. Bravo for the cast of outstanding players Henrikson as the primary villain I loved that about this movie he plays the piano in the movie beautifully for real on reel. Mr. Vasloo before 'Titanic' he is a great villain partner who is agile and deadly. The chase is on and they are all scrambling to stay alive and out of destruction's pathway. The accent from Van Damme which is always with him was an irreplaceable addition to the taste and the culture of the country there. The music yeah it was the right music for the job! Playin' C.C.R how ya not gonna love that when you're all the way down there? Jean Claude had just come into his'own'acting craft style but did not seem to go on above it too far after 'Hard Target' was made. His career seemed to settle down not too many years after as well. Although he is still making movies some aren't bad either. He is a decent action hero that can do different roles with a good but limited ability.But for this Woo film I am applauding his best efforts he stayed on a strong course with it fine fine actors and a good and gritty dirt in your teeth type of story that brought Wilford Brimley as the wilderness 'Uncle' . The uncle with the explosives! Where was he when I was growing up? I could have really used em'. I rated this one highly and recommend it as a great kicker of a fast paced manic action movie!

Hard Target's first half has a certain amount of depth and social conscience for an action film. For instance a homeless man 'Roper' Willie C. Carpenter is gunned down in public after no one will help him. But Hard Target's second half where it moves from the city to the swamps degenerates at times into downright silliness and has a rushed feel. The finale in the abandoned warehouse filled with old Mardi Gras paraphernalia was meant to be somehow meaningful but it's not it's just a finale in an abandoned warehouse filled with old Mardi Gras paraphernalia.Hard Target is a reworking of a much earlier film 'The Most Dangerous Game' 1932 about humans who kill humans for sport. However I believe Hard Target got ideas from the James Bond film 'Moonraker' 1979 check out the scene where Jaws chases Bond's contact through the streets of Rio de Janeiro. Hard Target's scriptwriter Chuck Pfarrer probably thought no one would notice.Although it doesn't excuse Hard Target's failings Woo was reportedly forced to edit Hard Target because of the violence and it was edited again by Universal Studios.Hard Target was later released on DVD with most of the action and violence restored. Hard Target's still not as violent as some of Woo's earlier Hong Kong efforts e.g. 'The Killer' 1989 'Bullet in the Head' 1990 and 'Hardboiled' 1992.And since Woo's action films rely on shoot'em ups which would be too violent for a mainstream U.S. film Hard Target suffers accordingly. Although Woo's vision may have been compromised and even with most of the action and violence restored Hard Target's still at times pretty silly e.g. Chance swinging from ropes in the finale and Chance's hillbilly 'Uncle Douvey' Wilford Brimley doesn't help the situation either. And the way some of the less important baddies wear black baseball hats as if they're there just there to be shot beaten or blown up. Also there's this flimsy plot device about the New Orleans police department going on strike which head baddie 'Mr Fouchon' Lance Henriksen and his team use as their opportunity to conduct a hunt in New Orleans. In Robocop 1987 the police strike was plausible because in that film the police had been taken over by a private corporation. But in Hard Target the police strike doesn't ring true. Hard Target makes attempts at being topical e.g. Mr Fouchon refers to the war in Bosnia as an opportunity that allowed him and his men to conduct some previous hunts therefore it would've been better if Hard Target had been more even toned and not allowed itself to mix violence with attempted humour. Woo's next U.S. cinema release was the disappointing 'Broken Arrow' 1996 and then the overrated 'Face Off' 1997 followed by the box office flop 'Windtalkers' 2002 and the forgettable 'Paycheck' 2003 then back to China to make the epic 'Red Cliff' 2008.Woo also continued his U.S. career directing a made for TV action flick 'Blackjack' 1998 starring Dolph Lundgren and a two hour pilot movie for the Canadian TV series 'Once a Thief' 1996 which was a reworking and Woo's same titled 1991 Hong Kong movie as well as producing 'The Replacement Killers' 1998 and 'The Big Hit' 1998.Although Hard Target is marred by silliness and implausibility it's first half has a certain depth. That coupled with it's polished look it's style and some of it's action scenes could lead you to believe you're watching something more than a Bgrade action film.If Hard Target had more thought put in and stayed within the confines of the city it could have stood out as a solid memorable and hardhitting action film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hard Target is a perfect action film. As the director himself said in an interview this movie is like a modern Western. Like John Carpenter John Woo is also a Western movie fan. In his first debut in Hollywood I disagree with the claim that he disappoints. He delivers again like his most entertaining Hollywood film Broken Arrow. There are two parts in this movie which are my favorite. The sequence takes place in a deserted street in the middle of the movie and the sequence which takes place in another deserted area as final showdown. The action scenes in this movie are amazing! There is a great bike chase scene in the middle he shot a similar scene in Paycheck but it was nothing. In another scene Van Damme and Pik Van Cleef are in a Mexican standoff which is even better than FaceOff. This is a movie which is imitated several times by his own director! You might interpret this as he likes that or as he imitated Hard Target because it was his peak. Arnold Vosloo and Lance Henriksen are terrific villains and especially Vosloo as the main henchman becomes one of the most memorable bad guys in movie history. Probably his best character so far! Lance Henriksen is another story. He defines the term villain. Since that year I have not forgotten the still he puts his pumpriffle on his arm and takes aim or the still that Van Damme breathes the dusty pumpriffle. Van Damme with long hair is also cool. John Woo uses slow motion even if too much sometimes and he zooms the arrows which the key object of the movie. A triumph! And may be Uncle Douvee character makes the movie clich a back up for the main action character and his romance with the lady is another clich but just ignore it. By the way Yancy Buther is so cute in this film and she was my love in this film when I was a kid. Van Damme and John Woo don't make such movies anymore. Perfect story perfect villains perfect action perfect editing perfect story line my personal favorite Van Damme film ever.".

Movie concerns a group of wealthy mercenary types lead by Mr. Fouchon Henriksen who's business is supplying men to be hunted by wealthy clients for the sport. One of the hunted daughter's comes looking for him and finds he's been killed and ends up meeting Chance Van Damme. Soon they uncover the game that they play as one of Van Dammes friends is killed. Soon the hunters become the hunted in the bayous of Louisiana and the awesome Marty Gras graveyard. John Woos directing in this action movie is great. Many of the slow motion shots are among the best parts of the movie. As far as Van Damme he does his usual act but thankfully keeps his butt clothed in this movie and doesn't hit the female lead. Henriksen is great as always and makes a great bad guy. He is probably the best actor in this film. Action in the movie is great but there are many laughable flaws in the movie. Just look at the double for Van Damme every time there is a big stunt. He doesn't look like him and the hair piece on him looks like he's wearing a coon skin cap. Plus there are various scenes of near impossibility gas can standing on the motorcycle and kicking the guy on the bike not to mention the lack of anyone in town being around while this goes on. But hey ignore reality and you'll enjoy this movie. one let down is this is an action movie not a martial arts movie Van Damme does very little Martial arts in this.".

I've never been impressed by Van Damme's acting but I've always found his fighting skills entertaining.  That mixed with Jon Woo's style of directing saves this movie.  His unique ability with slowmotion and camera angles makes the action scenes in this movie worth the wait.  His work in the climactic scene in the Mardi Gras graveyard is very reminiscent of his Hong Kong days when he was at his best.  If for nothing else I recommend this movie just to see some beautiful action sequences that only Woo can pull off in this day and age.".

It has everything a good action film needs A solid story line good acting even by JeanClaude Van Damme drama and action galore. This is probably John Woo's best American film to date possibly being surpassed only by FaceOff 1997.The story follows Natasha Binder Yancy Butler who would go on to star in Drop Zone 1994 with Wesley Snipes who is travelling to Louisiana New Orleans to find her father who went missing. She checks with his now wife being that he broke up with Natasha's mother when she was a child and she learns that he lost his job at the factory where he was working. She enlists the help of a female police officer who tells her to check at the homeless shelters. She checks there but to no avail. She does however meet a man named Elijah Roper Willie C. Carpenter a veteran who fought with her father in the war. He tells her that if he sees him he'll let her know.After being hasselled by some men she is aided by Chance Boudreaux a seamen who works down at the docks. Needing someone to help her find her way around the city she enlists his reluctant help by offering him a few hundred dollars which he needs to ship out fro the docks or else his boss won't let him. Chance and Natasha stumble upon a deadly game of catandmouse where men with no visible family are given a money belt and given a designated area to get to. Get there keep the money. If you are caught you are killed. The leader of the men Fouchon portrayed spectacularly by Lance Henriksen and his deadly assailant Van Cleaf Arnold Vosloo soon target Boudreaux and Binder as their next victims unless they can escape save themselves and eliminate their predators.Hard Target definitely has it's share of action stunts including incredible martial arts sequences and one disbelievable yet highly entertaining scene involving a motorbike a car and a train but as long as it's entertaining who cares right?This film is a rare occasion where JeanClaude Van Damme's shocking acting doesn't ruin the movie maybe because there is much more to focus on then him or maybe just that his acting isn't too bad.Hard Target definitely has some memorable scenes that will stick out in your mind long after viewing it. Aswell as that it has a decent plot line mindblowing action and good acting particularly from Lance Henriksen who is fantastic as the villain. I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a fun hour and forty give or take and someone who gets off on action and a generally enjoyable time. This is definitely in my top 5 action films of all time list in my head.Beau's Rating  12 out of ".

Vosllo is such a cool bad guy.His facial expressions and attitude make him such a cool guy and on the other hand Henriksen is also does a great acting job.

Hard Target has so much violence and actionany fan should be glad to see this shouldand there is no sex in it and that is a big plus for ME. Hard Target in MY opinion is Van Dammes best film to date but I also recommend some others for Van Damme fans like Blood SportSudden Deathand Double Team.

Lance Henriksen is perfect as the villain and Van Damme is a good hero. Overall quite an exciting and well done film though not perfect.";

It's not just the graphic imagery that got to me but the overall tone of the movie was incredibly dreadful and you could almost feel a presence of some sort of evil.This is a hard movie to review. It crosses all barriers when it comes to movie making...ALL. It makes you question yourself about what art is and if there's anything as going too far?But don't dismiss this. It's certainly much more than just being graphic for the sake of it. First off the cinematography is absolutely flawless. The opening scene had me in absolute awe. Beautiful... And my deepest respect to Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsburg. I could only imagine how much this would drain the actors both mentally and physically. They are amazing and deserve Oscars.I have to mention the violence too since it's a critical aspect. This isn't torture porn of any kind. It's natural it's looks almost too realistic physical sexual violence. That's why it works so effective on the audience. You can almost feel their pain. Never before have I watched a movie where I felt the urge to look away. You would think that in the end all this violence and self molestation is just a shock tactic but I assure you it's not. There is actually a plot and a sensible progression of the movie. I of course won't say too much. People need to see it.I can understand why some people wouldn't like it and that's okay. This is most definitely not for everyone.It may not be a movie that made me feel good but it made feel something and had an effect on me. It's beautiful sad poetic horrific and in the end oddly uplifting. A genre masterpiece.A must see.1010.".

	schema:headline " Embedded horror";
	schema:reviewBody "Where does horror reside in the psyche? Lars von Trier has established himself as a maker of serious avantgarde drama. He came to fame through Breaking the Waves a controversial story of how far someone would go for love. He founded the Dogme movement of verite cinema and made The Idiots where lunacy and sanity are cleverly mixed. Next came Dancer in the Dark an almost Janaceklike musical where a blind girl takes inner fantasy to extremes. There were experiments like The Five Obstructions and two highly theatrical Brechtian pieces called Dogville and Manderlay with chalklines instead of sets. One of the few uncontroversial films he has made is Boss of it All an extremely clever comedy that didn't receive much attention.If someone like von Trier makes a horror movie it is hardly likely to be standard fare. He makes films that provide himself and his audiences with thorny intellectual challenges. This results both in adherents and those which dismiss his work as pretentious. Inasmuch as this review is partly interpretative other viewers may find their own preferred readings which differ from the approach given here. With Antichrist although there are standard 'fright' moments the main horror is deep psychological manipulation that stays with you for days afterwards. Instead of lashings of gore that can retrospectively be dismissed as 'more CGI' von Trier seems to do exactly the opposite of what a Freudian psychotherapist would do in releasing obsessions. He locks the terrifying nature of the horror to the most extreme sexual images. The narrative itself follows a similar process. A psychotherapist with the best intentions leads his wife into the darkest recesses of her mind. But instead of releasing psychological trauma he reinforces it until he has to defend himself when she becomes the controlling force.A psychotherapist Willem Dafoe and his wife Charlotte Gainsbourg are making love as their young toddler climbs onto a desk to look at snowflakes outside. And falls to his death. This opening prologue is operatic in its soundtrack and intensity. Exquisite monochrome photography captures water droplets in slow motion to Handel. There is a very brief aesthetically contextualised glimpse of penetration setting the audience up for the psychosexual horrors that follow later. In the trauma of bereavement He asks his wife to visualise her worst nightmares in order to help her overcome them. She pictures the woods as symbolising her fear and they both retreat to an 'Eden'  an isolated cabin surrounded by woods.The film is divided into six parts including a Prologue the lovemaking and death Grief Pain and Despair The Three Beggars and an Epilogue. At the end of the prologue the next three chapters are heralded by three toy soldiers from the dead son's toyroom each appropriately named.With Grief comes very palpable sorrow from both leads. The players become substantial rather than dramatis personae. Colour is added to the previously monochrome palette literally and in terms of filling out their characters.As we go through Pain his wife seems eventually cured. Our nerves however are frayed. This is compounded by the rhythmic hypnotic pounding of acorns falling on the roof of the cabin and his irritating but inescapable smugness as he treats his wife as a patient rather than a human being needing support. He forever has a selfsatisfied smart answer. Retreating to her own area of expertise she comes out with ever more unanswerable metaphors including Nature is Satan's Church.

	onyx:emotionText "Where does horror reside in the psyche? Lars von Trier has established himself as a maker of serious avantgarde drama. He came to fame through Breaking the Waves a controversial story of how far someone would go for love. He founded the Dogme movement of verite cinema and made The Idiots where lunacy and sanity are cleverly mixed. Next came Dancer in the Dark an almost Janaceklike musical where a blind girl takes inner fantasy to extremes. There were experiments like The Five Obstructions and two highly theatrical Brechtian pieces called Dogville and Manderlay with chalklines instead of sets. One of the few uncontroversial films he has made is Boss of it All an extremely clever comedy that didn't receive much attention.If someone like von Trier makes a horror movie it is hardly likely to be standard fare. He makes films that provide himself and his audiences with thorny intellectual challenges. This results both in adherents and those which dismiss his work as pretentious. Inasmuch as this review is partly interpretative other viewers may find their own preferred readings which differ from the approach given here. With Antichrist although there are standard 'fright' moments the main horror is deep psychological manipulation that stays with you for days afterwards. Instead of lashings of gore that can retrospectively be dismissed as 'more CGI' von Trier seems to do exactly the opposite of what a Freudian psychotherapist would do in releasing obsessions. He locks the terrifying nature of the horror to the most extreme sexual images. The narrative itself follows a similar process. A psychotherapist with the best intentions leads his wife into the darkest recesses of her mind. But instead of releasing psychological trauma he reinforces it until he has to defend himself when she becomes the controlling force.A psychotherapist Willem Dafoe and his wife Charlotte Gainsbourg are making love as their young toddler climbs onto a desk to look at snowflakes outside. And falls to his death. This opening prologue is operatic in its soundtrack and intensity. Exquisite monochrome photography captures water droplets in slow motion to Handel. There is a very brief aesthetically contextualised glimpse of penetration setting the audience up for the psychosexual horrors that follow later. In the trauma of bereavement He asks his wife to visualise her worst nightmares in order to help her overcome them. She pictures the woods as symbolising her fear and they both retreat to an 'Eden'  an isolated cabin surrounded by woods.The film is divided into six parts including a Prologue the lovemaking and death Grief Pain and Despair The Three Beggars and an Epilogue. At the end of the prologue the next three chapters are heralded by three toy soldiers from the dead son's toyroom each appropriately named.With Grief comes very palpable sorrow from both leads. The players become substantial rather than dramatis personae. Colour is added to the previously monochrome palette literally and in terms of filling out their characters.As we go through Pain his wife seems eventually cured. Our nerves however are frayed. This is compounded by the rhythmic hypnotic pounding of acorns falling on the roof of the cabin and his irritating but inescapable smugness as he treats his wife as a patient rather than a human being needing support. He forever has a selfsatisfied smart answer. Retreating to her own area of expertise she comes out with ever more unanswerable metaphors including Nature is Satan's Church.

The cunningness of foxes suggests a reliance on logic whereas the subconscious can rely more on symbols introducing chaos to a 'logical world.' Chapter three is entitled Despair Gynocide.

	schema:reviewBody "It is with some regret that I have decided to spend time reviewing Von Trier's 'Antichrist'. I am by nature a curious film watcher and will at times succumb to temptation and reserve a couple of hours to cast my own opinion when a film creates ample controversy. Thus far my curiosity across the spectrum has been met with elation and disappointment in equal measure.This is and I make no apologies for this statement a truly terrible film. I was hoping to read the user comments and be satisfied that it was met with the utter indifference and loathing that followed my own viewing and was genuinely shocked with the ridiculous ratings that have been pulled from the posteriors of those who mistakenly interpreted this dull and pointless movie as high art.Given that the acting was by no means sub parDafoe was very good as a husbandpsychiatrist torn between his professional disposition and the demons of his relationship with his wife and Gainsbourg was nothing if not committed to the role of a postnatally depressed lunatic and the cinematography was at times excellent it should give you some idea of how bad this movie was.One review entitled 'Canonical Sermon Classical Hero Journey Numeric Elegance and Name of The Beast' offered an academic dissection of the movie...referencing the film's numerical balance and some other contextual information that completely fails to justify the relevance and poor execution of this movie which in principle before pen hit paper may have carried some merit and proved to be a dark and disturbing study of the humaninhuman condition.So let me 'break it down' without offering insight where there is none or jumping on board the 'Turner Prize' highart mindset that has corrupted modern art finding thought and intellect in the explicit and mundane.Firstly This is NOT a balanced movie no matter how Von Trier cuts the film into chapters. A nice prologue followed by over an hour of self absorbed boring nothingness aside from the revelation of child cruelty climaxing in a violent last 10 minutes that arrived way to late for me to care about the resolution. Simply put it is quite an achievement to bore someone to the point that genital mutilation the ejaculation of blood the image of a wife fingering a freshly drilled hole in her husband's leg does not leave them shocked or a little sick and yet I was so paralyzed by boredom that I was rendered immune to the horrors depicted on the television in front of me.It is all very well dissecting this movie for its symbolism and I am sure that for an academic essay it provides the necessary 'meat' for some critical analysis but seriously why bother when as a film as a piece of entertainment this movie fails at its most basic level.I have watched interviews with the cast who really don't seem to understand the movie and listened to drivel about how this was a product of Lars' depression. The reality is that 'controversy' is the most marketable aspect of the film and one has to question the misogynistic stanceintentions of the movie. I am not a fan of feminism as it has moved beyond equality but it certainly wouldn't be too late to question Von Trier's relationship to the fairer sex both in the context of this movie and his work as a whole.Imbalanced and a cry for attention a cheap snub of mainstream Hollywood that craves the attention Von Trier claims to shun or a failed arthouse movie that owes its substance and form to antiquated intellectual study that it fails to properly address and far superior 'cabin in the woods' movies that it does not get close to matching....Take your pick of which best describes this terrible film.If you want cabin horror watch 'Evil Dead'. if you like dark and harrowing try 'requiem for a dream'. There has been some talk as to the meaning of 'Antichrist' in the context of this movie. I can say with some certainty that it refers to the pure evil that stole 2 hours of my life last week. Damn you Lars Von Trier you are an idiot.".

There is no redeeming value to this film and I am shocked at the awards it garnered. Some scenes were almost enough to make me want to turn the DVD off. Despite being broken up into Chapters  the film has no real flow. It felt like it was 20 minutes at a time of the two leads talking followed by what in my opinion is torture porn that would be enough for most people to walk out of the film. Some of the more nasty highlights would include Sex scenes which include shots of full on penetration. A scene where Gainsbourg is lying naked in the forest masturbating until Dafoe arrives on scene and starts to have sex with her while arms emerge from the tree stump they lie on. An especially nasty scene where she smashes his testicles with a log and then masturbates him until he ejaculates blood. The follow on to that bit where she drills a hole in his leg sticks her finger in the wound and then bolts a weight to his leg.And who can forget the infamous scene near the end where she slides a pair of scissors into her vagina and removes her clitoris. If this is considered art then cinema is on a downhill slide. This film is not for the squeamish and I cannot recommend the title to anyone. Avoid at all costs.".

However it did not reveal WTF the point of events like  the only oddity that the autopsy reveals is that Nic has a deformity of his feet. But so what? We find Nic was being forced to wear his shoes on the wrong feet  did that cause his fall? Did that constitute senseless torture by his mother because she was an evil woman? Who knows the commentary revealed nothing. Nor did it reveal the symbolism behind the masses of women descending the mountain at the ending. I imagine they were the corpses of all the evil women? How did all these evil corpses get there? What was the significance of Eden? How did it become the epicenter and burial ground of evil women??? What about all the sex scenes? The finale suggests that her thesis was disproved by Eden where the forces of nature revealed that women are the truly evil manipulative and conniving of the sexes. So why the constant violent insistence that her husband puck her at every inopportune moment when he is trying to help her she is constantly grabbing at his zipper his dick its all rather desperate and nonsensical... The scenes went from evocative to boring. I'm bored where is this plot going? What plot? I'm not impressed  although Defoe's pubic hair is rather impressive but I digress. After all that she mutilates herself? Why? Is her clitoris the source of evil and by mutilating herself she is being set free? We will never know because she immediately gets strangled and burned SalemWitchstyle. Oh and I almost forgot the most hokey element  the three beggars  Bahaha! The fox the doe and the crow. She says when they appear someone must die they appear  she dies. The end right? NO! They again appear to Hubby as he is limping out of Eden. It is absolutely comical.

On that level he certainly achieved his objective. He managed to fashion one of the most boring mindlessly gratuitous unexcitingly violent plodding pointless meaningless and downright timewasting movies ever.Whilst Boll is an errant hack with little or no cinematic skill or flair Lars Von Trier is considered an artist. He too has managed to craft a horror flick that isn't any fun. Now before anyone starts yelling it's not a horror flick I'm going to tell you why it is.The plot cribs from some notable past masters of the genre  Dead Calm 1989 Don't Look Now 1973 Long Weekend 1978 2008 to name but three. Traumatised couple decant to an alien environment to try and rebuild their lives following tragedy and emotional upheaval. Weirdfreakydisturbing events befall and violence and death ensues. As in Long Weekend nature becomes a sinister force playing a malevolent role in the narrative that unfolds and Antichrist even replicates the cries of a child in the wilderness moment that distresses the female protagonist in that earlier film. The images of dead and decaying wildlife prey unto insects are reproduced also. There are even elements of Friedkin's schlocky The Guardian 1990 submerged in there somewhere.So we have a standard horrorthriller setup. Next we have gore and torture porn components framed and presented in no more disturbing ways than in the Eli Roth Hostel movies. Dafoe gets a manual drillbit through the leg and a circular grind stone attached through the wound. However there are certain aspects that set Antichrist apart. It wears artistic pretensions clearly on its sleeve with slomo black and white sequences which bookend the movie and are filmed like ultracrisp and sharp high definition segments from a Bergman feature. Very tasteful. We also get a glimpse of erect man muscle. Wow. Daring.Dafoe's character an antipsychiatry therapist drawls out the most pretentious subFreudian drivel and implements the most laughably inept psychotherapeutic formulations. theories and expositions yet expressed in a movie. Looking further back the awesome confusion that arose between conversion hysteria and schizophrenia and the misrepresented psychobabble exposition for Norman Bates multiple personality in Hitch's Psycho is a work of deep and accurate psychological insight by comparison. When Dafoe's character reaches the absurd eureka moment of substituting levels of fear for the levels of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs it is frankly laughable.Antichrist is not particularly thrilling or exciting or scary but then I guess it's not supposed to be. If it were it would be closer to the type of film it is pretending so hard to be distinct from. Other main key aspects which are supposed to set it apart from its less arty stablemates are the much touted explicit and shocking graphic sex scenes. Which are to be honest nowhere near as graphic in their depiction of masturbation and penetrative sex than the first five minutes of your average adult porno fare. The real coupdegras artistic credential verification moments however would be the erect penis ejaculating blood and Charlotte Gainsbourg inflicting severe genital mutilation upon herself with a scissors. I remember Regan selfmutilating with a crucifix in Friedkin's the Exorcist back in 1973  that depiction lacked the intense visual detail the process is afforded in Antichrist but the blood sound effects and context made it a much more chilling affair all round.Von Trier must be having a laugh. He has taken tried and tested horror movie staples and wrapped them up in absurd psychobabble steeped them in controversy and repackaged and resold them as a piece of high art cinema.So many seem to have fallen for it. The only thing truly shocking about this film considering the pedigree of some of the stuff the director stole from is just how boring and meaningless it seems to be. The ending should have given it away  blankfaced children stumbling like sheep through a forest whilst observed by the main character. They're the audience folks. They're us.Still I'll give it 310 for Von Trier's dazzling sense of audacity.".

If I don't like an American film I don't go out and bash on reviewers from America and then state that Danes have more sense  what's that all about? Sense of what?

And you don't have to come from Denmark to like Antichrist though it is a very constructive statement I'm guessing there is one or two people from Russia or Poland who likes the film also...Back to Lars Von Trier and Antichrist. First of all  I don't know why everybody keeps saying this film is a gore fest. Uhhh it's so brutal violent and extremely gory. What? Okay there's more blood than in Hannah Montana but if Antichrist is a sick and gory film I don't know what you would call films like Ichi The Killer Naked Blood Inside and Audition? There is more bloodgore in Se7en than in Antichrist or maybe the same amount so I don't know what all the fuzz is about... Anyway... I loved the film!!! When I left the theater I didn't know quite what to think but it grows and becomes better and better. It's a fantastic work of art the cinematography by Anthony Dod Mantle is amazing and the whole feel of the film is both beautiful and scary at the same time. Willem Dafoe is at his best in this one.I guess you have to have an open mind when watching this. The film does not give any answers and is rich on symbolism  guess one could call it experimental horrordrama. Lars Von Trier is back in his hypnotic visual style and mindfucing storytelling and this is where he is best! Not a film for the mainstream audiences but I recommend it if you have an open mind and want something new and different and have almost as much sense as Americans.".

But that's how I see this movie and I personally appreciate art films more than mindless entertainment ala explosions fast cars  and worst of all  characters who are seemingly unable to have conversations with any depth or personality in general. You have an open mind and a certain amount of depth to appreciate this movie.Second the amount of explicit sex and violence brings modern film to a new height... And based off of what you read about this movie it's clear that MOST people cannot handle it Hundreds walked out of the early film festival showings earlier this year. Understandably. I haven't had my hand over my mouth fighting so hard to keep looking at the theater screen...probably in all my life.I have NEVER seen such grotesque violence involving genitalia in a serious movie... only Troma movies and the like.

But this movie is anything but trash art  There are big brains behind it insane theories and thoughts and one of the most well acclaimed directors of our time in control of it all.It pisses me off when so many people try to call the movie pretentious  since when is flat out getting creative and doing what you want to do and expressing things the way you feel them as a director... since when is that pretentious??? We need to appreciate the small amount of legit directors who are still making art films and getting them into theaters... Soon actual personality in film will be extinct if the industry keeps heading in the direction it is...Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg easily carry the entire film almost completely on their own. They don't have too much of a personality but it's because they're not supposed to  they are just vessels or bodies representing the terrible emotions they are feeling as they try to recover from the grief felt by the death of their only child. Not only emotions... but even more so they represent human nature and how it causes us to react to terrible things  and the fact that there is nothing we can do about it...OK... I'm getting carried away already. I could go on and on.Antichrist may genuinely be the darkest most morbid film I have ever seen. It's definitely the most brutal.

	schema:headline " The selfproclaimed 'best film director in the world' is not interested in finding resolution for these characters through any form of character development";
	schema:reviewBody "Antichrist is divided into four chapters a prologue and epilogue. During the prologue a nameless couple who are billed as He Willem Dafoe and She Charlotte Gainsbourg are having sex leaving their baby son unattended. The baby climbs out of its cot reaches a window and then falls to its death. Both of the parents grieve heavily for their son but it is She who is most affected slipping deeper into depression. He who is a therapist disregards her doctor and the medication given to her. Instead He decides to take her to a cabin in the woodlands a place called Eden where She was last with their child trying to finish her writing. He attempts to treat her himself with a number of psychological exercises but there is something terribly ominous brewing inside Eden.The first chapter to Lars Von Trier's Antichrist entitled 'Grief' remains compelling because of its authenticity and gritty sense of realism. The aesthetic qualities of the film and Gainsbourg's performance craft scenes of emotion that are utterly believable. Named Best Actress at the Cannes Film Festival Gainsbourg displays her grief and her anger with a real sense of heart. Of the two characters in the film she has the much grander role. The muted colours in these scenes along with the dim grey lighting and Von Trier's erratic handheld camerawork further contribute to a reflection of her isolation and her heartache. It is a rather personal film for Von Trier as he is believed to have written the script as a means of therapy for his own depression.The aesthetics throughout the film are equally as impressive during the Eden sequences. The film was primarily shot in Germany and there are some visually haunting moments that both unique and beautiful. A scene where She's voice over is heard over the top of a paintinglike representation of the woods as her ghostly figure appears in the background is just an incredible sight to behold. Von Trier has stated that a lot of his inspiration for the film has been derived from the horror genre and he aptly controls the tension through the authenticity of the woodlands the use of near silence and the slow tracking movements of the actors. The continuation of the handheld camera in the forest creates a sense of a detached body from the actors almost as though someone is watching and stalking them. In one moment a wide shot films He walking through the forest. The camera pans quickly to the left of the screen and then centres back on him almost gesturing him to move towards the rustling leaf and discover something very disturbing. Aesthetically this is an intense and powerfully constructed film.However as with Dancer in the Dark the film's narrative becomes increasingly contrived over its duration to the point where it defies all logic. That a therapist would treat his own partner disregard her medication and take her to a place as isolating as Eden  regardless of what it means to her past  is a contrivance that audiences will have to decide on themselves. It is also when Von Trier unleashes the films fury and condemnation for these characters and the landscape that the narrative selfdestructs. All of the emotion that was captured in those quiet painful scenes is lost to moments of sheer absurdity. When He does find that rustling leaf he discovers a brutally wounded fox that stares at him opens its mouth and then says to him in a demonic voice 'chaos reigns'. The ghastly animal imagery throughout the film such as this and also deer with a dead foetus still attached to it contributes to an increasingly unpleasant narrative that detaches itself from the realism and the personal grief felt by the two central characters.The detachment is felt most significantly in the last two chapters of the film which contain some of the most sickening and repelling acts of violence and sexual aggression in recent years of cinema. These moments are almost unwatchable and detract from the emotion and the conflict felt by She because of how absurd it is and because of just how awful it is to witness. The film attempts to attribute her behaviour to being possessed by nature which is said to be a satanic form. Yet whether anyone will actually find that credible in justifying such contempt for humanity and human suffering is extremely unlikely. It is through these two chapters and beyond that the film is also increasingly uncertain about what it is saying in regards to women themselves. Von Trier does not think that his film is misogynistic and does not claim to be one either. His poor relations with his actresses over his career and the way a woman is physically and emotionally destroyed in this film inspired by the execution of women in the 16th century makes it difficult not to see his disregard and lack of respect for them. Von Trier has claimed in interviews that this is a representation of a woman's conflict with herself and though this might be true he offers his character here just like in Dancer in the Dark no outlet or redemption. He condemns them and sentences the leaving his film as increasingly nasty and unsympathetic towards grief and anxiety.Antichrist is aesthetically and emotionally an interesting and intense film for its first two chapters. Yet because of Von Trier's persistence for publicity and attention through horrid acts of violence this is a film that remains wildly distracted unfocused and wholly unlikable. The selfproclaimed 'best film director in the world' is not interested in finding resolution for these characters through any form of character development. It is because of this that he weakens his supposed exploration of inner conflict in favour of his own needs to shock manipulate and outrage his audience.

	onyx:emotionText "Antichrist is divided into four chapters a prologue and epilogue. During the prologue a nameless couple who are billed as He Willem Dafoe and She Charlotte Gainsbourg are having sex leaving their baby son unattended. The baby climbs out of its cot reaches a window and then falls to its death. Both of the parents grieve heavily for their son but it is She who is most affected slipping deeper into depression. He who is a therapist disregards her doctor and the medication given to her. Instead He decides to take her to a cabin in the woodlands a place called Eden where She was last with their child trying to finish her writing. He attempts to treat her himself with a number of psychological exercises but there is something terribly ominous brewing inside Eden.The first chapter to Lars Von Trier's Antichrist entitled 'Grief' remains compelling because of its authenticity and gritty sense of realism. The aesthetic qualities of the film and Gainsbourg's performance craft scenes of emotion that are utterly believable. Named Best Actress at the Cannes Film Festival Gainsbourg displays her grief and her anger with a real sense of heart. Of the two characters in the film she has the much grander role. The muted colours in these scenes along with the dim grey lighting and Von Trier's erratic handheld camerawork further contribute to a reflection of her isolation and her heartache. It is a rather personal film for Von Trier as he is believed to have written the script as a means of therapy for his own depression.The aesthetics throughout the film are equally as impressive during the Eden sequences. The film was primarily shot in Germany and there are some visually haunting moments that both unique and beautiful. A scene where She's voice over is heard over the top of a paintinglike representation of the woods as her ghostly figure appears in the background is just an incredible sight to behold. Von Trier has stated that a lot of his inspiration for the film has been derived from the horror genre and he aptly controls the tension through the authenticity of the woodlands the use of near silence and the slow tracking movements of the actors. The continuation of the handheld camera in the forest creates a sense of a detached body from the actors almost as though someone is watching and stalking them. In one moment a wide shot films He walking through the forest. The camera pans quickly to the left of the screen and then centres back on him almost gesturing him to move towards the rustling leaf and discover something very disturbing. Aesthetically this is an intense and powerfully constructed film.However as with Dancer in the Dark the film's narrative becomes increasingly contrived over its duration to the point where it defies all logic. That a therapist would treat his own partner disregard her medication and take her to a place as isolating as Eden  regardless of what it means to her past  is a contrivance that audiences will have to decide on themselves. It is also when Von Trier unleashes the films fury and condemnation for these characters and the landscape that the narrative selfdestructs. All of the emotion that was captured in those quiet painful scenes is lost to moments of sheer absurdity. When He does find that rustling leaf he discovers a brutally wounded fox that stares at him opens its mouth and then says to him in a demonic voice 'chaos reigns'. The ghastly animal imagery throughout the film such as this and also deer with a dead foetus still attached to it contributes to an increasingly unpleasant narrative that detaches itself from the realism and the personal grief felt by the two central characters.The detachment is felt most significantly in the last two chapters of the film which contain some of the most sickening and repelling acts of violence and sexual aggression in recent years of cinema. These moments are almost unwatchable and detract from the emotion and the conflict felt by She because of how absurd it is and because of just how awful it is to witness. The film attempts to attribute her behaviour to being possessed by nature which is said to be a satanic form. Yet whether anyone will actually find that credible in justifying such contempt for humanity and human suffering is extremely unlikely. It is through these two chapters and beyond that the film is also increasingly uncertain about what it is saying in regards to women themselves. Von Trier does not think that his film is misogynistic and does not claim to be one either. His poor relations with his actresses over his career and the way a woman is physically and emotionally destroyed in this film inspired by the execution of women in the 16th century makes it difficult not to see his disregard and lack of respect for them. Von Trier has claimed in interviews that this is a representation of a woman's conflict with herself and though this might be true he offers his character here just like in Dancer in the Dark no outlet or redemption. He condemns them and sentences the leaving his film as increasingly nasty and unsympathetic towards grief and anxiety.Antichrist is aesthetically and emotionally an interesting and intense film for its first two chapters. Yet because of Von Trier's persistence for publicity and attention through horrid acts of violence this is a film that remains wildly distracted unfocused and wholly unlikable. The selfproclaimed 'best film director in the world' is not interested in finding resolution for these characters through any form of character development. It is because of this that he weakens his supposed exploration of inner conflict in favour of his own needs to shock manipulate and outrage his audience. As a nasty exercise in gratuitous sex and violence this is a film to be avoided.";

Far from a traditional horror film LVT gives us the darkest of psychological works that starts with shock before travelling down the spiral through grief despair and panic ending in travesty. Gainsbourg and Defoe take us there they carry the film on their monumental performances  Gainsbourg gives everything physically and emotionally to her role while Defoe's character's grip on intellectualism is unrelenting. With death and depression permeating every frame of the film it has to be said that much of what is seen is stunningly beautiful  i really cant overstate the quality of the cinematography at the same time the hauntingly evocative sound design adds that much needed 3rd dimension of pure evil that finishes off the work perfectly. It says and shows many disgusting things about humanity but does so with such purity of vision such artistic conviction that i found it totally irresistible. Not a film i'd want to see again in a hurry but certainly one i'm thankful i've experienced  it pushes the envelope in hitherto unforeseen ways that will probably affect film as a medium for years to come.

	schema:reviewBody "I have honestly never laughed so uncontrollably at a movie ever I think and I really didn't think I would say this about this movie. This movie amused in a way that no genuine comedy film ever could. This is everything that's wrong with movies today all wrapped up in a single film.From the very first minute you could tell that the director Lars Von Trier is so desperately fond of his own work that there were numerous long drawn out shots in black and white from strange angles and many really crazy cuts from scene to scene. The film was introduced with a really long black and white sex scene in superslowmo to Italian opera music. It's as pretentious as it gets. My friends and I were looking at each other in disbelief at the amount of slow motion used in this film.There were many scenes where you thought What's the relevance of this? I'll probably find out later. Well in this film you never do. So much of the film is done in slow motion and time feels like it's hardly moving for most of this film. The dialogue was really painful to listen to and if there had been no conversation in the whole movie it would hardly have made any difference. This film though obviously had a reasonable budget but all the money and effort seems to have been spent on making the film look arty and sophisticated but this film lacked the basics a decent story and decent dialogue.The two leading actors Willem Defoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg did a reasonable job with the terrible dialogue they had to wrestle with along with the numerous graphic gratuitous sex scenes and extremely graphic violence. Both of these features being very overused in order to sell what is an awful film. It was just to make the less discerning viewer who doesn't interest himher self much with the story happy. However everything happened at such a painfully slow pace I can't imagine anyone being pleased with this. Some people just want to watch sex and violence. Well I wouldn't waste your time here then because you can find both much better elsewhere! However with all the terrible dialogue the painfully slow pace the regular black and white superslowmo sex scenes the superslowmo of someone walking on a bridge the laughable scene with the crow won't spoil it for you etc etc I actually just cracked and laughed so uncontrollably I cried for several minutes. The irony of so much effort going into this film's style to cover up how terrible it was by a director who thinks so highly of himself and actually making a complete fool of himself with this skidmark of a movie.My suggestion to you would be that if you want to see this movie watch at speed x2. It will still be a slow movie and you won't miss much about the dialogue. There isn't much of it and what little there is is complete rubbish. You will however save about 52 minutes of your life. Just looking at the IMDb statistics I can't believe that the film was only 104 minutes long. It honestly felt like about 3 hours.Antichrist is a very slow very boring very pretentious and an utterly pointless movie.".

It is almost a spoof of its predecessoras Mifune's nonchalant and perpetually unwashed antihero helps a group of goody twoshoes samurai save their framed master. This is also the first onscreen collaboration between Toshiro Mifune and the young Yuzo Kayama before they costared to such memorable effect on Redbeard.Nobody spoofs Kurosawa better than the man himself this is without a doubt his funniest film yet he never treats it as a secondclass product. No slouch the director peppers this light romp with unforgettable visual flourishes enraptured homages to the American Westerns that so inspired him and an endnote of surprising violence the likes of which Tarantino could only dream of.At a fastpaced 96 minutes this is probably a great entry point into the cinema of Akira Kurosawa and a film that would be much more highly regarded had it not come from such an established filmmaker.".

Mifune plays a samurai who takes it upon himself to try to save a rather hapless but nevertheless worthy clan from government conspiracy and from its own foolishness. It's a role that gives him both plenty of good lines and plenty of good action sequences. Kurosawa of course knows just how to get the most out of all of the material and the story also provides some interesting psychological insights on the characters.The settings are very good and they are often used in creative ways in telling the story.

	schema:headline " A wonderfulsee";
	schema:reviewBody "...but the movie is great fun even when you know what's going to happen.I'd like to call it the Bside of Yojimbo mainly because it revisits the same character that that movie is based on Sanjuro but in other respects as well being it much less renown than that movie not that it is any less good making it sort of the movie that a real Kurosawa fan would know about. But these two pieces are mirrors of themselves. They are strategy movies in that they are artistic 'games' that keep the viewer guessing also showing aspects of life in the form of a staged situation and since Kurosawa and his writing collaborators were such great masterminds at this one is immediately caught up as if he were playing himself or at least trying to keep up with the players' moves. The movie piles up images intrigue mystery and suspense and resolves it all in a very cohesive almost perfectionist way. I mean it is hard to find mistakes here though we know that most of it is uncanny. I think in this sense Kurosawa had the talent of structuring his plot negatively precisely by way of mistake. Every single positive plot line is rebutted by the man who has the bigger picture in mind which is the samurai Sanjuro who has the capacity of seeing negatively of experiencing mistake before it occurs. This renders wonderful plot construction throughout and source of limitless inspiration in my opinion. Sadly this wasn't anything that someone like George Lucas or many other people Kurosawa influenced over the years used in their movies. If they had the Star Wars legacy would be a complete experience and not just a pile of special effects with a couple of decent dramatic story lines I give Lucas that much. Sanjuro builds wonderfully and its cohesiveness is only surpassed by its cinematic artistry.The first scenes are both beautifully staged intelligently written and remarkably revelatory as we witness not only a few minutes of indepth character construction but also the plot structure unfolding and the general philosophy of the film taking heed. It then goes to show through a combination of Kurosawa's staging and Mifune's acting the omnipresence of the samurai much in the way Luke Skywalker failed to show his when he was finally a Jedi in Episode vi of the Star Wars saga. For example in that movie the Jedi pushes 'bad guys' away through an omnipresent power which no one sees or feels. That in itself negates the possibility of us believing the power is actually his the Force he called it giving it a name and such a redundant use of it already weakens the whole concept apart from the fact that most of the revelations of this 'Force' are creatively deficient. Here the samurai confronts over 200 men in a most astonishing opening fight that lasts very little time. One of the great lines is his samurai contender's 'ceasefire' who says 'Leave him. It'll take us too long to get rid of him'. The scene is a great battle scene because of the character content it portrays one which summarizes in just a few seconds how necessary and ingenious a fight can be within the framework of a story far from being just merely a formulaic tool for suspense Check out how he turns the back to the camera... cinematically more effective than attracting a sword through thin air. Finally in this opening sequence Kurosawa presents the exemplary subject of his film a batch of rebellious dimwits unexperienced and weak again in very little time this is explained to the utmost detail who must overcome an inevitable destiny of imperial corruption. Their only strength of course is the goodness of their cause. We are about to witness the intent of the impossible how a rebellion of just a handful of men shall try to overcome an entire 'empire'. This also reminds us of Star Wars but sadly again Star Wars never makes us understand how powerful the empire is what type of corruption it holds what is the dark side anyways... why is it dark just because they wear black just because the are holding Leia prisoner? must be because the emperor is so ugly and what qualities strength weaknesses do the rebels hold? Oponents are devoid of contrast within themselves thus that whole storyline is more or less a waste. In Sanjuro it is central because one is forced to acknowledge the ludicrous scenario so present in humanity and a very exemplary one in itself the strength of corruption versus the weakness of decency. One severely outnumbers the other. And one is much more mischievous and astute while goodness as we see here is few and far between seems vulnerable innocent and in many cases just plain dumb. The addition of the samurai personifies both sides and creates gorgeous shading throughout. Finally the triumphal finale is wonderfully executed. And the final cinematic metaphors of that plight are unforgettable. There are many things that can be analyzed here. But the reception of the thematic elements is what varies and inevitably as in all or most film except for those we call classics it is this that will divide opinions and make some people accept one film and not another like one film or dislike it. So yes there is a possibility you'll find it uninteresting as a whole. However what really makes this movie worthwhile for anyone I say that as objectively as I can even if you don't like BW or older films  is the final scene one of the most spectacular segments I've witnessed in my life. So maybe just for that it is worth sitting through it.".

	onyx:emotionText "...but the movie is great fun even when you know what's going to happen.I'd like to call it the Bside of Yojimbo mainly because it revisits the same character that that movie is based on Sanjuro but in other respects as well being it much less renown than that movie not that it is any less good making it sort of the movie that a real Kurosawa fan would know about. But these two pieces are mirrors of themselves. They are strategy movies in that they are artistic 'games' that keep the viewer guessing also showing aspects of life in the form of a staged situation and since Kurosawa and his writing collaborators were such great masterminds at this one is immediately caught up as if he were playing himself or at least trying to keep up with the players' moves. The movie piles up images intrigue mystery and suspense and resolves it all in a very cohesive almost perfectionist way. I mean it is hard to find mistakes here though we know that most of it is uncanny. I think in this sense Kurosawa had the talent of structuring his plot negatively precisely by way of mistake. Every single positive plot line is rebutted by the man who has the bigger picture in mind which is the samurai Sanjuro who has the capacity of seeing negatively of experiencing mistake before it occurs. This renders wonderful plot construction throughout and source of limitless inspiration in my opinion. Sadly this wasn't anything that someone like George Lucas or many other people Kurosawa influenced over the years used in their movies.

We see here how a group comes to have a leader. First one man stands out against him the competitor for leadership but Sanjuro's intuition and actions put him ahead.  There is a beautiful marked difference between Sanjuro and the men. He is the lazy quiet tiger seemingly passive yet containing an immense power  a tightly drawn bow. The men are barking puppies energy spilling over but to no good end.Kurosawa presents a couple challenges to the viewer. THere is a terrible absurdity in the killing of all these men for it becomes quiet clear with the symbol of the prisoner that the average soldier is a frightened herd animal not good or evil but cowardly. Sanjuro recognizes this but has no choice for he wants to live and so must kill. Thus he must even kill the young men who he helps when they foolishly come after him. The prisoner is won over by the old lady  so we see an almost christian ethic. In the tensions of the film one feels that the people riled up by lies to fight for the enemy quickly become targets of the just young men's swords  luckily it does not come to this but one recognizes the horrible possibility and inevitability of such a struggle. Thus we are faced with a critic of war  men scared like cattle battle under the flag of corrupt leaders and those that may love them must kill them if they are not to die by sword or become slaves to tyrants.stupid friends are worse than enemies For you know who your enemies are and that they wish to destroy you.In Sanjuro we also see the soldier so long in battle that he is unable to live a normal life. He can not wear the house kimoto he is to bound up in fighting  he is samuri warrior and he cannot escape this much as Achilles cannot return home to Pthia. And we sense Sanjuro must whilt in the easy domestic life for his is the road of struggle. The pleasant scent of the straw in the barn the pretty camillias are still able to touch him but he cannot enjoy them he is a soldier and therefore his sensitivities must yeild to the demands of war.We see only one man worthy standing with Sanjuro and that is the uncle the chamberlain the horseface.

	schema:headline " Enjoy the comedy but don't forget the duel";
	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers warningAn overwhelming proportion of the comments on Sanjuro in IMDB has been given to its comedy elements. This makes perfect sense because no other KurosawaMifune corroboration has taken this allout crack at comedy. It does not mean that sense of humour is lacking among Kurosawa's strength. Indeed no master is truly great without a sense of humour. For example both Hitchcock and Kurosawa like to inject a dose of their sense of humour respectively at the frightening and poignant junctures in their films. In Sanjuro the amusing characteristics of the character portrayed by Mifune were not new. They were all there in Yojimbo before but fully unleashed in Sanjuro and some on the brink of being overused such as the flexing of the neck and shoulder muscles which looks like a shrug. Indeed Kurosawa did not lose a single opportunity of making Sanjuro so much fun to watch. The nine young samurai courageous but impulsive and inexperienced provide excellent material and the mood here is set from the very beginning in the scene when they are trapped in their meeting place. After Mifune I'm using the artist's name instead of the character's for simplicity had driven away the enemies and calls them from the hiding place below their heads pop up in threes twos and singly giving it almost an animation flavour. The rescued mother and daughter is of course a pair of darlings particularly the mother whose interaction with Mifune is a classic yin and yang confrontation but depicted in a most amusing way. And then we have the captured samurai who keeps popping out from the closet in which he is confined offering his unsolicited opinion then suddenly remembering his station in the scheme of things crawls back inside demurely closing the sliding door behind him. These are but a few examples that give the film a festive mood.The DVD I watched has only Chinese subtitle. Although I can't really claim to judge the quality of the translation as I don't know Japanese gut feel tells me that they are good compared to the garbage you often see on screens in Hong Kong these days. Still I can't help but think that for Sanjuro some of the fun may have been lost in the translation. Fortunately body language and facial expression does a lot to make up for it.There is much more in Sanjuro than just first class comedy. Kurosawa is a great master of capturing motion on the screen as Ozu is the great master in capturing stillness on the screen. The most outstanding scene in Sanjuro demonstrating this occurs quite early in the story. After Mifune voluntarily joins the nine they formulate the first plan he would take three men with him to try to rescue the lord's wife and daughter while the rest would scout around for information. This is followed immediately by a series of rapidly cut shots each with a young samurai running swiftly in the street at various directions. The whole series takes a few seconds but the momentum generated is immense.While the tone throughout the film is light we should not lose sight of the undercurrent continually building up between the Kurosawa and Nakadai culminating in one of the best duel scenes in the entire film industry if not the best. When the lord's rescued wife first meets Mifune she comments that he is too bright' like an unsheathed sword. At the end Mifune says that both he and Nakadai are unsheathed swords. From the very beginning these two recognise each other as truly worth opponents and this is reaffirmed during their encounters throughout the film. In the end Mifune is forced into the duel reluctantly. Even Nakadai himself does not seem to particularly want it. However within his own universe of logic because he has been made a fool by Mifune the only way out for him is a duel. What we have then is a duel very similar to the fastdraw type of duels in westerns but at close range. And that is what makes a world of difference. The two men stand facing each other within striking distance in absolute stillness for what seems to be an eternity I was tempted to rewatch the DVD to measure and report the actual time but such a piece of information would take something away the beauty of the film. The absolute intensity is followed by simply brutality as the swords are unsheathed in a flash but not so fast as to impair our visual enjoyment of the beauty of the geometry of the draws and the abrupt eruption of blood from Nakadai's chest signifying a punctured heart the Chinese translation of the title is Heart piercing sword'. While good direction in a western may match the intensity I would personally prefer the visual beauty of the silent deadly draw of the sword to the loud cracking of the gun.".

For those who are not familiar with Kurosawa and look to start this and Yojimbo are the best starting points. But to say that it is not one of Kurosawa's very best is not entirely a disservice to him. One flaw for me was that the story was not very clear on the first viewing or at least as clear as what I'm used to from him then again the samurai genre is one I've only started to dig into. But a second viewing brought it clearer and was even more suspenseful and amusing. That it is not as satirical or perhaps it is than what I had heard is not a minus however. The best that can be said that it is highly watchable and could grow on those looking for a samurai film with more based on character than on immediate flowing bloodshed and carnage. The least that can be said is that it does not compromise artistry and thoughtfulness for mediocrity. Grade A".

	schema:headline " Sanjuro is the sequel to Yojimbo but better.";
	schema:reviewBody "Sanjuro is the sequel to Yojimbo. The antihero is once again played by Mifune. He is a roaming masterless samurai after the Japanese emperor officially disbanded the samurai. Sanjuro's only mission in life is to survive and live by the unspoken samurai code of honor. In both films it is only by accident that he combat the oppressive. The opening scene in Sanjuro was a long shot of a temple. It was followed by a jump cut closeup of the same temple. This is a jarring effect that is a pattern of Kurosawa. He used this very same technique in the opening sequence of  Rashomon. Kurosawa's superbly sharpen directorial skills are evident in this film. He uses a narrative economy technique that lets the audience dive right into the story without using a long drawout exposition. The plot and characters are explained within the first five minutes of this film.The story begins during a samurai meeting in a house. Sanjuro interrupts this meeting. He's been listening to their conversation. The cocky Sanjuro relaxes their guard because he analyzes their situation. He predicts and is subsequently correct that they will be ambushed. The group prepares for their certain death. Quickly Sanjuro devises a plan and boldly states trust me to his cohorts. This excellent delivery from Mifune lets the audience know that this sequel is going to be just as fun if not better as Yojimbo. A hilarious character for this film is the captured guard that was spared because of the rescued woman. His role was tiny but very memorable. He was the comic relief for a few of the tense moments. Towards the end of the film the flower signal scene is super funny. Sanjuro tricks the three goof balls into putting the flowers in the creek. The neighboring samurai rejoice with excitement. Meanwhile the captured guard shortly joins the celebration but gets a look from the samurai and returns to the closet. This is reminiscent of the three stooges. I really love this scene.Reoccurring Kurosawa patterns include the use of multiple film planes. An example of this is the scene in the barn. Sanjuro is lying on the wheel barrel. The camera POV is on the floor shooting upwards. The wheel barrel is the first plane Sanjuro is the middle plane and the other samurai with their backs against the wall are the third plane. This abstract framing adds to the film's production value. It also breaks up the predictable  framing of the characters. Likewise framing is consistent in this film as in all Kurosawa  film's because all of the players are perfectly in view no actor is excluded from the camera view. Mifune's character finally arches in this sequel because he is told killing is a bad habit by the rescued older lady. He is quick to change internally to her wishes. Although Sanjuro is told once again please don't use too much violence Sanjuro's hand is forced. He is forced to kill the numerous bad guys that are guarding the three hostage samurai because of their mistrust. He is hard on himself but harder on the three samurai that he slaps. In addition this scene is reminiscent of Yojimbo. Sanjuro is entrusted with the lives of the enemy but instead slaughter his real enemy. Another example of his arched character in this film occurs in the final scene. Sanjuro does not want to fight the banished samurai. Once again Sanjuro is force into violence. His last words were I am just like him he was like a sword that should have a sheath. This is a clear sign that Sanjuro does not enjoy the lifestyle of the samurai. Whereas before it seemed like he didn't mind the senseless killing. In all Sanjuro succeeds as another excellent story by Kurosawa. It is most definitely Hollywood influenced film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers herein.By 1962 Kurosawa had already reinvented film and this was slowly changing the world's imagination. But Japan's film industry was every bit as blockheaded as Hollywood and he found himself indentured to a system that forced him into ever more popular tripe. Kurosawa did not write this. It was instead put together by others out of crowdpleasing formula.It blazes no new ground in visual narrative. It is not intelligent. The visual strokes do not relate to the story at all something Kurosawa invented. What we are left is with is a stupid story filmed by a master. In fact freed from worrying about things that matter more he is able to spend time with the framing. And his highly refined compositions show it including many that use his characteristic multiple planes. Even Mifune is reduced to the type of selfparody we would celebrate in the later Tarantino.This is therefore a sad film especially since we know what the next decade would bring for Kurosawa.What's interesting is the minor mutiny that Kurosawa and Mifune conspire to create under the surface. They started their partnership making intelligent films behind the backs of the studio bosses and much of the public. But by this time were reluctant guns for hire walking through various situations that may or may not captivate them.See this story for what it is Kurosawa as ronin not giving a noh about the local boss but willing to fight for him as he wanders through his territory. Willing to be the footstool so long as he can send chrysanthemums down the stream.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 4 Worth watching.".

Toshiro Mifune wanders in from a back room to tell them they are all idiots then protects them by killing a whole bunch of bad guys.The group of samurai are a comical bunch wandering about like a bunch of newborn ducklings and Mifune takes the role as their protector because that's what heroes do.But his charges aren't the only idiots. Everyone in the movie is an idiot except for Mifune and some peripheral women characters. The plot is pushed forward entirely by the stupidity of its characters to the extent that it's a wonder any of them lived past puberty. While Yojimbo was a movie about a really smart guy tricking less smart people Sanjuro is about astoundingly gullible people being fooled by the only person in the movie who isn't a halfwit.Still it's very likable and often funny particularly in the case of a mellow prisoner and an unflappable mother.The movie also has a whole it's terrible that so many people are being killed moral that reminds me of the old TV series Kung Fu which espoused peace while serving a steady stream of violence. Like everything else in this movie it's pretty silly.It's a fun movie and if you liked Yojimbo and Seven Samurai it's worth checking this out as well. But watch Yojimbo and Seven Samurai first because they are much better movies.".

Yojimbo was exciting and amusing Sanjuro alas is overlong repetitive and inferior.The story is about a group of samurai meeting in a shrine one of whom is the nephew of the region's Chamberlain who had laughed off the nephew's exposure of corruption in the local government. The nephew had then told the local Superintendent who expressed belief. The ronin who happened to be sleeping nearby had overheard the conversation and warns that the Superintendent is the true criminal...and is proved right when the Superintendent send some assassins to kill the nephew and his friends. The ronin manages to trick the assassins into leaving and the nephew and his friends learn that the Chamberlain had been kidnapped and held hostage.Sounds exciting right? But then the movie starts to repeat itself with people continually looking over walls or opening and closing doors with the ronin running back and forth and fighting and being upset at having to kill people with the nephew and his friends being mistrustful of the ronin and causing further grief because of it with troops marching back and forth.

Together they are just terrific and feature Toshiro Mifune as the amazingly skilled and clever wandering swordsman who is out to right wrongs and make the world a better place much like the character Zatoichi in the long series of samurai films that debuted the same year SANJURO was released.In this case there is a corrupt local official and a very naive group of young and energetic but STUPID young men are about to expose his corruption to his bossexpecting the boss to act and restore justice. But as Mifune is very clever and these guys are dumb but nice he advises them NOT to go to the boss as he too is probably part of the problem! They cannot accept that the boss is corrupt but through Mifune's brilliant maneuvers they realize the truth and assist him to restore peace and justice.This movie is amazing because although there are some wonderful action scenes the level of comedy is also pretty high and I loved the tongueincheek aspects of the film.

	schema:reviewBody "The more I see of Kurosawa's movies the more astounded I am  everything he made in this period is pure gold. Yojimbo is one of the coolest movies ever made  probably the template for the modern ironic hero movie. Here he develops and expands the character confounding the audiences expectations by mixing in both comedy and a greater level of cynicism and ending it in true tragedy  the hero recognising so much of himself in the supposed bad guy.So much of this movie seems to be Kurosawa's sly little joke at the Japanese film industry  its hard not to see Sanjuro as a stand in for the lone film maker trying to maintain his integrity in a world of well meaning idiots and cynical philistines. Maybe thats reading too much into it but then again that is one of the great joys of Kurosawas movies of this period  there are so many multiple interpretations of this movies all of them fascinating  yet you can also just enjoy them as pure cinematic pleasure. And Sanjuro is pure pleasure  by turns hilarious touching and jaw droppingly exciting. The fight scene in the middle where he kills a group of guards then admonishes his captives for forcing him to do it is superb. And the final scene is of course pure brilliance.As for the title of my comment  Sanjuro repeatedly corrects his young acolytes that they are not 'nine' but 'ten' as he is on their side. I keep giving Kurosawa movies 9 here because 10 is perfection  so hard to achieve. But collectively his movies of this period are a 10 its impossible to imagine anyone topping what he achieved between Roshomon and this movie.One criticism  I watched this on the BFI version. They have an 'introduction' which stupidly gives away in detail the ending of the movie  how moronic can you get??? I wouldn't mind but the introduction manages to be uninformative and poorly presented  a movie of this quality deserves so much better than this.".

Here he develops and expands the character confounding the audiences expectations by mixing in both comedy and a greater level of cynicism and ending it in true tragedy  the hero recognising so much of himself in the supposed bad guy.So much of this movie seems to be Kurosawa's sly little joke at the Japanese film industry  its hard not to see Sanjuro as a stand in for the lone film maker trying to maintain his integrity in a world of well meaning idiots and cynical philistines. Maybe thats reading too much into it but then again that is one of the great joys of Kurosawas movies of this period  there are so many multiple interpretations of this movies all of them fascinating  yet you can also just enjoy them as pure cinematic pleasure. And Sanjuro is pure pleasure  by turns hilarious touching and jaw droppingly exciting. The fight scene in the middle where he kills a group of guards then admonishes his captives for forcing him to do it is superb. And the final scene is of course pure brilliance.As for the title of my comment  Sanjuro repeatedly corrects his young acolytes that they are not 'nine' but 'ten' as he is on their side. I keep giving Kurosawa movies 9 here because 10 is perfection  so hard to achieve. But collectively his movies of this period are a 10 its impossible to imagine anyone topping what he achieved between Roshomon and this movie.One criticism  I watched this on the BFI version. They have an 'introduction' which stupidly gives away in detail the ending of the movie  how moronic can you get??? I wouldn't mind but the introduction manages to be uninformative and poorly presented  a movie of this quality deserves so much better than this.";

	schema:headline " A Swashbuckling Toshiro Mifune Makes Sanjuro Absolutely Enthralling!";
	schema:reviewBody "In Akira Kurosawa's highly underrated sequel to the much revered Yojimbo Toshiro Mifune reprises his role as the titular masterless samurai this time having the arduous task of cleaning up the mess created by the younger generation of a ruling clan whose misplaced trust leaves them vulnerable to the clan's true enemy. Set in 19th century Japan a gruff disheveled footloose samurai turns up in a deserted shrine where a cabal of nine young progressives is plotting to overthrow a corrupt regime. Boldly and brashly he appears among them while they have been fumbling for a plan and haughtily takes over the ticklish task of directing them. Consistently decrying the fledgling samurai as idiots expert strategist Sanjuro seemingly can't help himself from getting involved with the fallout of their political meddling as the hapless bunch is desperately in need of saving. Starting with his chivalrous rescue of the chamberlain's wife and daughter from the corrupt warlord Sanjuro leads the army of warriors on a wild goose chase so the nine inept samurais can free the chamberlain. All the action soon leads us to a dark rugyanking conclusion as our eponymous samurai waves goodbye to those he helped and walks off into the sunset heroic and alone. The fact that Sanjuro is played by none other than the grunting swashbuckling Toshiro Mifune makes the movie thoroughly enjoyable from beginning to end. The movie largely gyrates around the marvelously eccentric mannerisms of Mifune's performance who swaggers through the entire film with a bemused expression  grimacing scratching yawning and stretching in an ironic counterpoint to his character's phenomenal skill as a swordsman. The film's humor arises from Sanjuro's weary irritation and the contrast between his slovenly behavior and the phony ceremonial propriety of others. But while Mifune's satiric portrayal is a delight Akira Kurosawa sets it in a more recognizably Japanese milieu with a complicated plot involving political and historical intrigue. Kurosawa applies the full force of his cinematic genius with brilliant widescreen composition that tells the story in visual terms as clear as the verbal ones. He guides the narrative mostly for laughs but when the action kicks in the sword fighting is brutal and memorable.Sanjuro may not be Akira Kurosawa's most celebrated work but you will find his witty paw prints all over the snappy dialogue unique characters and intriguing plot  an effort that I personally rank higher than Yojimbo!".

Having said that this movie is so great. I love absolutely 100 adore the directoractor partnership of Kurosawa and Mifune. So many places they have proved time and time again that they only make movie magic. This film is fantastic. There is nothing I could see that is wrong or incorrect. The movie is just Woah. The cinematography is pure PURE Kurosawa no one could do this story no one could capture the words of the actors or even the slightest 'scratchoftheneck' of Sanjuro like Kurosawa does. I would usually say I applaud but for this certain movie I bow to you Akira Kurosawa. The story lacks nothing. I have always wondered why people say so much of Akira Kurosawa's influence can be seen in Spaghetti Westerns and other westerns. This movie showed me. Long and intricate shots of only the faces of those worrying or the final standoff fight scene. slow paced action but fast paced wit made this movie awesome.Mifune won a place in my heart with this movie. Sanjuro has unbreakable wit and clever thoughts though he may not seem to be the pure 'samurai' that is implied. I am ending this review saying that usually people may think that the use of subtitles us harsh and they don't like it. Or that subtitles take away from the jokes that the characters make. But the subtitles of Kurosawa's movies add to the movie for me. Not knowing Japanese having to read the subtitles as they pass makes me pay even closer attention to the film. While with a movie in English I could be folding laundry and just listening to the story as it happens. With any Kurosawa film I claim that would be impossible.SilverRating and the highest yet 810.".

Yojimbo retains its indebtedness to the sword with heavy doses of ruthless action. There is certainly action in Sanjuro but it rarely gets truly ruthless another symbol of maturity in Sanjuro's character. If Kurosawa wanted he could have included action and made the film more commercial. Instead he did what was the right thing to do. He had his protagonist claim in the end I am just like him the dead antagonist he was like a sword that should have a sheath Yojimbo and Sanjuro are both essentially comedies but they evoke different senses of humor. The black comedy of Yojimbo is nowhere in evidence here. Sanjuro is more or less slapstick humor. Unlike most Kurosawa films this film is mostly indoor. Nature comes into play only in the final scene of the film which the audience knows is justified once they watch the film!".
