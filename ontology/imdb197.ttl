	schema:headline " Fairly faithful adaptation!";
	schema:reviewBody "I first saw this version in the early 1970's on late night TV and recently in the 1990's can't wait for it to come out on DVD! Georges Marchal does a fantastic acting job as D'Artagnan. A gorgeous man for sure physically though he doesn't resemble the D'Artagnan character in the book JeanPaul Belmondo in the 1959 and Gerard Barray in Bernard Borderie's 1961 2 part TV production did resemble the character. This story followed the book and thankfully did not omit too many characters or streamline characters. The Musketeers are well cast and defined. The Constance and Kitty are well cast. They are just like the characters written in the book.Cardinal Richelieu and Count de Rochefort excellent. Yvonne Sanson was a beautiful Mediterranean dark haired Milady de Winter and against physical type Milady as everyone knows was a blondeturned in a wonderful performance. Her performance was very much like Lana Turner's 1948 and Mylene Demongeot's 1961 and in my opinion she was just as good. Pia Douwes in the Dutch 2003 made a stunning auburn haired Milady de Winter.Acting and looks make the difference not hair color or physical type. Bourvil did a great job as Planchet as did Keenan Wynn in the 1948 and George Kinnear 1973 but for those familiar with the book Planchet though a lackey was not a clown and he himself went into military service himself at the end of the novel. The setssceneryauthentic 17th century costumes are great.This movie did get film awards. As one user said the movie is slow and is right but it is not boring! I recommend this film to anyone who likes classic takes on Alexandre Dumas Three Musketeers. This film compares favorably with the Gene Kelly 1948 Three Musketeers and the 1961 Gerard Barray 2 part production.".

Emanating from France that country obviously produced its own adaptations over the years  but when stacked against the best of the Englishspeaking renditions this 'foreign' one definitely comes up lacking! For the record I own a 1942 Mexican film by the same title where the story was however tailored for comedian Cantinflas and should also be checking out THE FOUR MUSKETEERS from 1963 which also promises to be heavy on the comedy. That said I was impressed with Vittorio Cottafavi's MILADY AND THE MUSKETEERS 1952  which as the overseas title suggests had presented the familiar events from the perspective of Milady De Winter.The main reason for the failure of the film under review it seems to me is that the script basically chose to deal with only the skeleton of the narrative  which coupled with the thoroughly uninspired handling makes for an overlong and frankly tedious outing! In fact the tale's nominal villains  the aforementioned Milady and Cardinal Richelieu  are pretty much kept in the background so that the ensuing action with the swordplay seldom rising above the adequate anyway! and drama lack suspense because a sense of real danger is never actually felt throughout! Even if the extensive cast does include a handful of familiar faces Georges Marchal's overage D'Artagnan Gino Cervi's Porthos Yvonne Sanson's sexy but as I said ineffectual Milady  also unaccountably saddled here with a buffoonish husband!  and Bourvil's Planchet  whose comedy relief overshadows even the romance and intrigue! few of the famous characters ever truly come to life!! While one could have argued against it being in blackandwhite since the two most popular versions i.e. 1948 and 19734 were in color it is worth noting that some of the very finest swashbucklers were filmed that way too! For the record both star and director would often return to the genre over the years the latter most notably with LE BOSSU 1959 but he also made concurrent spoof versions of the source material here to counter Richard Lester's own jokey revamps! and the former's include two semisequels in 1954's THE LAST MUSKETEER and 1962's THE SECRET MARK OF D'ARTAGNAN in both of which however he played different parts!  incidentally I should be watching 4 more of his Epic efforts during the course of this Easter marathon.".

	schema:reviewBody "Apparently Jackie himself merely 17 when this film was made says to stay away from this movie. I shoulda learned that earlier. It's at least two movies Frankensteined together and new footage with the old master beating up the flamboyantly gay landlord farting in his face and avoiding his Popeyethemed attack complete with Popeye's theme music  calling all lawyers was added years later to complete the film such as it is.Plot? Barely there. Jackie plays an evil warlord who kills one of his men who squirts blood out of his mouth in an unintentionally hilarious scene reminiscent of Monty Python's Black Knight whose young son Jackie again is raised by another former henchman who does not want Jackie to be a fighter. You want to destroy life? Well kill flowers! he yells tossing potted plants at his wayward stepson. However Jackie's been training in secret with a crazy old guy in the woods since he was 6 in a series of disjointed and somewhat creepy flashbacks and there's only so much he can take before springing into action especially since people attack him and his sister on a daily basis. He fights through a bunch of generic thugs as the camera whips around randomly the canned soundtrack saws away pompously and dubbed threats I will take care of you now! Hum! assault the viewer's ears. Characters mostly pop up to get killed foster dad a young pickpocket or disappear after a few scenes Jackie's uncle and sister.The editing is such a mess it's usually impossible to tell exactly what's going on. When Jackie's pickpocket friend I put that in quotes because they only met three times beforehand is threatened by being tied up high on a pole Jackie fights off the thugs around him. We cut to a thug falling into the water and then the pickpocket just falls from the pole he was shown to be snugly tied to shown by a dummy falling towards the camera a musical sting and Jackie looking... kinda bummed. Goodbye my little friend. Then a suddenly shirtless Jackie points at the villain actually he points at the camera  most of the dialogue scenes are played in separate shots and declares YOU killed him. YOU are responsible for his death. I dunno Jackie. Was he the one who made the ropes magically disappear? The dubbing is horrid the characters either having British accents or Brooklyn accents neither of which match the tone well at all. It sure is weird hearing Jackie's voice dubbed over by somebody else and the endless Ho! Hah! Huuuh! during the fights is the fine line between hilarious and unbearable. Every blow even light smacks get a loud CRACK sound effect and at one point Jackie holds a conversation with a villain while we hear a hilarious number of loud CRACKS in the background!And then there's the final battle with the warlord now elderly and played by a tall actor who looks nothing like Jackie same dubbed voice though and a fat guy who follows the Way of the Fish which Jackie easily disposes of Old Master cheering from the sidelines. Jackie and the warlord blindfold themselves which is cool but it mostly is a desperate attempt to hide the fact that even Jackie is played by a different actor now. The bad guy whips around and whinnies like a horse. It's that kind of movie.Don't fret though fans. PseudoJackie beats the villain by knocking him over breaks his neck by turning it slightly to the right  complete with spaceship sound effects  and Old Master says Jackie has earned the right to carry a blue flag. Jackie waves it triumphantly the movie ends five seconds later and the soundtrack grinds to a halt.Only for people who want to see Jackie's first starring role. Other than that you won't find any of the elaborate choreography and setpieces you'd expect from Jackie although some of the handtohand stuff is pretty well done from what you can see of it through the insane editing. You'll likely have more than a few laughs as well albeit the uneasy kind.Rated R for God knows what reason. The violence save the blood squirt is clean there's no swearing and a really cheesy attempted rape scene involves a fully clothed couple wrestling while the woman screams. Norway banned it although in retrospect that was a really good idea.".

Other than that you won't find any of the elaborate choreography and setpieces you'd expect from Jackie although some of the handtohand stuff is pretty well done from what you can see of it through the insane editing. You'll likely have more than a few laughs as well albeit the uneasy kind.Rated R for God knows what reason. The violence save the blood squirt is clean there's no swearing and a really cheesy attempted rape scene involves a fully clothed couple wrestling while the woman screams. Norway banned it although in retrospect that was a really good idea.";

	schema:reviewBody "Fans need to know there are three edits of this movie. Another possible title is Cub Tiger from Kwantung. Other than that there is no way of knowing which one you have by looking at the box or titles. You have one chance in three of getting the one that is not that bad and two chances in three of getting the stinkers. If I could do video editing I could put together a fourth version that would be as good as any Jackie Chan movie without needing any additional scenes. If there's a guy with a moustache at the beginning of your DVD then go out and buy another one. Both of the stinkers begin with the guy in the moustache. Any time you see Jackie Chan fighting this guy in the moustache Kwang YungMoon it is NOT Jackie Chan. The better version begins with Tien Feng and brother fighting Chen HungLieh. The scene ends with Tien Feng escaping to raise his dead brother's child who is the grown up Jackie Chan in the next scene. Though this is the better version it skips the scenes of the child growing up and tutored by Simon Yuen. Further problem is that in one version Simon Yuen is a borderline pedophile who puts the boy bare ass into a bag of snakes. The other version is far more family oriented. My idea of the best my fourth version would be to begin the movie with the child watching the kung fu school practice. This version unfortunately seques into the snakes in a bag scene. Instead replace that segment with the scene from the other version with Simon Yuen holding a chicken leg out for the child to grab. The masterstudent scenes in this edit are not creepy at all. There is also a rape scene that comes and goes and even comes again after it was cut if that makes any sense... really it was like that. Also in one version with Simon Yuen there are some totally unnecessary scenes where he is teaching Jackie's body double. Most important of all in this genre is the final fight. Both versions with moustache guy end with a fight with Jackie's body double. The good version ends with an eight minute long fight on a dock. This is Chen HungLieh and occasionally his body double versus the one and only totally real Jackie Chan. This is a darn good fight. Fans of Jackie or old school martial arts movies need to see this fight. So get the right version and just rest assured despite some things being dumb by the time the beer buzz hits you will be watching some real good action at the final 89 minutes.".

	schema:reviewBody "Contrary to popular belief and even in contrast to Jackie Chan and many other sources Cub Tiger From Kwang Tung aka Little Tiger of Canton was finished and even had a small release probably around 1973 or 1974 I currently cannot find exact details though it was filmed a few years earlier in 1971 done a little before his stunt work in Fist of Fury. Chan was given an opportunity to star in this movie by his biggest sister from his Peking Opera youth whom was now an assistant to a film producer. In Chan's autobiography I Am Jackie Chan he has nothing good to say about this experience stating One night the director and producer quietly disappeared taking with them any hope that the movie would be finished. It is not his first film either he had done several movies as a child actor in the 60s with Big and Little Wong TinBar 1962 being his first appearance in a movie. He looks quite young though and slight of build compared to his later appearances.Jackie Chan he uses the screen name Chan Yuen Lung using Sammo Hung's old opera name portrays Hsiao Hu an adopted precocious martial art youth who has been brought up by a semisadistic foster dad Tien Feng Fist of Fury Young Master and enjoys sparring with his foster sister Hsiao Lam Shu PeiPei when he is not working for his Uncle Chiang at Chiang Kee Noodles. Hsiao Hu does not know that his real Dad died absorbing Lu Chi's aka 3rd Brother Kwan Chung Leg of Doom the move sounds good does not look that impressive though should be named Leg of Partial Hurt so Tien Feng could get away and raise his Hsiao Hu.Meanwhile back at the noodle shop a group of ruffians order a plethora of food yet refuse to pay. Hu's superior Kung Fu is shown as he destroys them in fighting. Lu Chi just happens to be their boss and this angers him immensely when he finds out. Hu's foster dad is perturbed by his fighting and tortures him with excess work. At first it is just moving extra pails of water but after another incident even though he saved his sister he is forced to put his hands into broken glass great dad. Later he forces Hu to really fight his foster sister later in the film though he states that they were made for each other. Of course Hu's foster dad is only trying to prevent him from using his Kung Fu so he won't be found out by the vengeful Lu Chi though I do not think this point is ever explicitly said. As in any martial art movie I can only recommend this for Jackie Chan or martial art movie fanatics for completeness. The editing is quite bad and the story is a bit hard to follow leaving lots of floating plot points. The lifted score I am pretty sure this is not an original piece is quite annoying as it is repetitively used. The martial art action is decent though Jackie Chan looks quite better than everyone else and so the pacing is sometimes off in the fights. The finale works as well as it should though the highpoint of the film is the demonstration of skills during the beginning credits where Chan gets to show off his technique and acrobatic skills the 70's Jackie films show Chan do more of his Peking Opera background than later films as well as this film shows him preeye surgery.The film quality of the Rarescope R1 edition is quite poor with a cropped picture shown 2351 but a lot of image is missing burntin subtitles that are occasionally replaced by other subtitles when the cropping interferes and that replacement also has typos and grammar mistakes and copious amounts of damage. Also the back cover description has many mistakes with its summation of the plot. The funniest is the combo of his father has forbidden him ... from learning the martial arts and ... killed his father many years before. Still it is nice to have available in a nonMaster with Cracked Fingers version shown close to what it originally was.The extras are a hodgepodge of trailers still gallery and a 6plus minute questionnaire and answer with Jackie Chan. The still gallery is not too bad with what looks like lobby cards and stills from the movie. The Q and A with Jackie Chan is a shaky camcorder print of Jackie being questioned after a showing of Rumble in the Bronx quick talk about the longer HK cut. So this was probably originally filmed around 1997 in the UK the year it came out in UK with other clues such as the accents and he talks quickly about future projects Police Story 5 probably talking about New Police Story though that would not come out until 2004 a western story obviously talking about the future Shanghai Noon 2000 a South African story Who Am I 1998 and about finishing A Nice Guy later known as Mr. Nice Guy though filming was done in 1997. Not much is learned from this extra other than a quick mention of the fireman story that never came about and audiences that are annoying are ubiquitous. Jackie is asked to perform some moves which he absolutely hates to be asked to do and he feigns a previous knee injury though later he can be seen bouncing around without any problems.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie came with another one New Fist of Fury which was a poor pseudosequel to Bruce Lee's original masterpiece. You'll sometimes see Snake Fist Fighter sold in mall stores as Master With Cracked Fingers complete with deceiving fancy cover. Got mine from WalMart actually. Anyway this movie features the alwayswatchable combination of Simon Yuen you know.. he's ALWAYS the drunken homeless guy who whups everyone's ass with a bamboo stick and Jackie Chan. These two you'll find in Drunken Master Snake in Eagle's Shadow many many others. Obligatory evil warlord kills Jackie Chan's dad in a duel and he his dad leaves Jackie that's what he's called in the movie no original name given with his friend and fellow warrior who adopts him as his uncle. Young Jackie trains with Simon Yuen known in this movie as The Man Who Isn't There to be a great kung fu guy. He has to use his skills when thugs reak havoc in his family's restaurant. Turns out these bullies are the obligatory evil warlord's henchmen. His uncle punishes him several times for fighting carry 50 buckets of water back  forth from the well oh uh.. catch these heavy flower pots.. and uh.. oh yeah stick your hand in this broken glass. throughout the film and it kinda gets annoying after a little while. There seems to be a slight incestuous undercurrent between Jackie and his adoptive sister too..Very weird. similar to Fists of Fury in that the hero is tempted by a female member of his immediate family.. in Fists it was Bruce's cousin who wanted to hit it off. is this a recurring theme in kung fu flicks? I haven't watched enough of 'em to really tell.. if I see one more with that sorta stuff something's wrong. Okay so Yuen fights Casanova Wong a great veteran actor usually in the comedytype kung fu films who plays an effeminate landlord who extorts money from Jackie's uncle. Not only does he defeat him he adds insult to injury by farting in his face. Pretty typical kung fu humor. Wong inexplicably eats spinach and uses his Popeye Special. After some disjointed flashback scenes and stock footage from Drunken Master Jackie fights the obligatory evil warlord and suprise suprise beats him. Breaks his neck too. That's almost always how it works in these sort of films. It's an okay movie actually.. Jackie's voice actor isn't too overbearing and there are some familiar faces in the film too. It's one to pop in the old VCR now and then.".

Young Jackie trains with Simon Yuen known in this movie as The Man Who Isn't There to be a great kung fu guy. He has to use his skills when thugs reak havoc in his family's restaurant. Turns out these bullies are the obligatory evil warlord's henchmen. His uncle punishes him several times for fighting carry 50 buckets of water back  forth from the well oh uh.. catch these heavy flower pots.. and uh.. oh yeah stick your hand in this broken glass. throughout the film and it kinda gets annoying after a little while. There seems to be a slight incestuous undercurrent between Jackie and his adoptive sister too..Very weird. similar to Fists of Fury in that the hero is tempted by a female member of his immediate family.. in Fists it was Bruce's cousin who wanted to hit it off. is this a recurring theme in kung fu flicks? I haven't watched enough of 'em to really tell.. if I see one more with that sorta stuff something's wrong. Okay so Yuen fights Casanova Wong a great veteran actor usually in the comedytype kung fu films who plays an effeminate landlord who extorts money from Jackie's uncle. Not only does he defeat him he adds insult to injury by farting in his face. Pretty typical kung fu humor. Wong inexplicably eats spinach and uses his Popeye Special. After some disjointed flashback scenes and stock footage from Drunken Master Jackie fights the obligatory evil warlord and suprise suprise beats him. Breaks his neck too. That's almost always how it works in these sort of films. It's an okay movie actually.. Jackie's voice actor isn't too overbearing and there are some familiar faces in the film too. It's one to pop in the old VCR now and then.";

The plot seemed to be too disoriented and choppy.  The quality of the dubbed voices on this film are miserable.  There is not much chance to build sympathy for the characters that get killed or hatred for the villain.Jackie Chan's later style combines traditional martial arts fighting with some of the same beautiful comic style also used by Buster Keaton Charles Chaplin and Gene Kelly.  Bits and pieces of this show up in Snake Fist Fighter.  The movie is probably worthwhile for Jackie's fans who want to see how much he has developed over the 27 years of acting.".

Master with Cracked Fingers starts with young boy trying to learn Kung Fu but he doesn't have money to pay for the lessons. He bumps into old beggar and beggar promises to young boy that he will teach him. Years go by and Jackie Yes he is called Jackie in this movie gets into many fights and each time he fights he is punished by his father father doesn't want Jackie to fight. There is impressive stunt scene when Jackie is thrown from 2nd floor to ground Yes I know he landed soft. Talking about those fight scenes I believe there's even more than in The Big Boss 1971 and don't miss ending Jackie becomes king of harbor. They force Jackie to fight by sending Jackie's pickpocket friend up in post. Then they let rope go and Jackie tries to save pickpocket but there is too many enemies and Jackie accidentally lets rope go and pickpocket falls to his death. Then its Jackie versus 1971 main bad guy when he beats him we jump to 1979 and someone else but Jackie Chan is fighting against 1979 main bad guy who said he killed Jackie's real father. Of course Jackie wins that fight. So thats what this movie was about. There's also really forgettable domino scene ruined by Dean Shek but Jackie is clearly main star here.".

He secretly trains with an elderly master who he originally assumes is a beggar. The training is tough but he grows to become highly skilled. Jackie is working as a waiter when he crosses a group of minor gangsters. He easily beats them but his father is far from pleased not only that the gangster's boss is furious and orders his men to beat Jackie. Things escalate and ultimately the gangsters burn Jackie's house with his father inside. Inevitably Jackie will ultimately face the man responsible. Before that though his master fights a rather camp landlord who has been pressuring Jackie's employer.When I watched this I didn't realise that what I was watching wasn't the original film but an edit with many scenes changed it does explain why it was a bit messy at times. The main story is simple enough to follow but certain scenes seemed out of place most notably the opening scene with a moustache twirling villain who is virtually forgotten till Jackie has to fight him in the final scene there is some explanation that he killed Jackie's real father in that opening scene and the man who raised him was a friend of his father. There is plenty of fighting this is fun enough but it is obviously so highly choreographed that at times it looks more like a dance than a fight. There is a fair amount of comedy sometimes it is funny other times it is too forced more than once I suspected that a gag was added to the dub that wouldn't have been in the original version. Having Jackie Chan play a character renamed 'Jackie Chan' might have seemed a good idea when this dub was made but I found it to be a distraction. One scene that is just weird and would have been best left out features Jackie as a child being forced to strip naked and climb into a bag containing snakes. The cast are okay Siu Tin Yuen is probably the most impressive as Jackie's Master Jackie Chan does a decent job but few people watching this would guess that the person we are watching here would go on to be a global star. Overall this is entertaining enough and is worth watching if you enjoy cheesy old martial arts films.".

He plays a young waiter who has a unique Kung Fu skills which he uses to tackle the bullies who find it hard to beat him. The bullies soon get fed up with Hsiao and they start to take advantage of his loved ones which just gets him more upset and sends him on a path of vengeance. The only problem is that Hsiao's father forbids him to use his Kung Fu skills to defend himself and he is constantly punishing him for fighting in there village but when the bullies go a step too far he gives him his blessing to take out the crime kingpin who has caused trouble in his life before. I really tried my hardest to get into this movie because you can't read the subtitles on the DVD and the bonus subtitles only pop up every now and again. I managed to piece the main parts of the storyline together but I missed a lot of the dialogue which is a shame because the film isn't that bad. With that aside it's not the greatest action that I have seen from Chan but for his age he really does show that he has a promising future in action movies. His acting isn't too bad and there are some emotional scenes which he performed quite well but the whole look of the film pretty bad. For entertainment it's a watchable movie if you get a dubbed version and the epic fight at the end is worth a watch so for its time it's actually not that bad. Watchable.RoundUp This movie was directed by HoiFung Ngai who only directed this movie and the Witch in 1975. For the time he done quite a good job with bringing an authentic action movie to the big screen but the dodgy camera work near the end really does need a remastering.I recommend this movie to people who are into their actionmartial arts movie starring Jackie Chan Biao Yuen PeiPei Shu and Hung Lieh Chen. 410".

	schema:reviewBody "Right well given the age of this movie and the stage during Jackie Chan's career it was made it should be kept in mind that by today's standards then this is hopeless outdated.Being a fan of Jackie Chan I had to watch this movie and I guess that you really have to be a fan of Chan to enjoy it. If you sit down to watch it as an ordinary movie and not because it is a Jackie Chan movie then you will be laughing and most likely also bored out of your mind.I got a horrible dubbed version DVD from Amazon that didn't even come with the original language track and it appeared to have been a transfer directly from VHS to DVD without any editing or improvements what so ever. It was just awful. At least if they had opted to keep the original language track the movie would have been somewhat more enjoyable. These ridiculous halfhearted English dubbings really are more of a nuisance than they help a movie in any way.The sound effects in the movie are bad but hey weren't they all in these really old Kung Fu movies? The English dubbed language track was just horrible to listen to and the movie didn't really have that great dialogue. And sad to say the fighting was really really staged to the point it was painful to watch. And to make matters worse suddenly there was a reference to Popeye in the movie complete with the music from Popeye playing are you kidding me? That was just ridiculous.And the English title of the movie Master with Cracked Fingers what was up with that? There was no cracked fingers in the movie at all. I really didn't get that choice of movie title.Master with Cracked Fingers is one to watch if you are a big fan of Jackie Chan but don't expect too much from it. Well if anything then watch the movie for the death scene at the very last fight it was just hilarious  if you can stand the five minutes of robotic staged martial arts.I guess every great star had to start out somewhere and with age comes experience.".

	onyx:emotionText "Right well given the age of this movie and the stage during Jackie Chan's career it was made it should be kept in mind that by today's standards then this is hopeless outdated.Being a fan of Jackie Chan I had to watch this movie and I guess that you really have to be a fan of Chan to enjoy it. If you sit down to watch it as an ordinary movie and not because it is a Jackie Chan movie then you will be laughing and most likely also bored out of your mind.I got a horrible dubbed version DVD from Amazon that didn't even come with the original language track and it appeared to have been a transfer directly from VHS to DVD without any editing or improvements what so ever. It was just awful. At least if they had opted to keep the original language track the movie would have been somewhat more enjoyable. These ridiculous halfhearted English dubbings really are more of a nuisance than they help a movie in any way.The sound effects in the movie are bad but hey weren't they all in these really old Kung Fu movies? The English dubbed language track was just horrible to listen to and the movie didn't really have that great dialogue. And sad to say the fighting was really really staged to the point it was painful to watch.

Daniels is okay as the earthling but Lloyd is simply terrible as the alien overacting up a storm. The rest of the cast is adequate as are the costumes set and production details.

Cases in point Mister Magoo The Avengers  awful! Christopher Lloyd whom I normally enjoy was so miserably miscast in this role.  His manic portrayal of our beloved Uncle Martin is so unspeakably unenjoyable to be almost criminal. His ranting groaning grimacing and histrionics provide us with no reason to care for his character except as some 1 dimensional cartoon character.The director must have thought that fast movements screaming dialogue and onetake slapstick had some similarity to comedy.  Apparently he told EVERY ACTOR to act as if they had red ants in their pants.Fault must lie with the irresponsibly wrought script.  I think the writer used It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World as an example of a fine comedy script.  As manic as that 1963 classic is it is far superior to this claptrap  in fact  suddenly it looks pretty good in comparison.What is most sad about this movie is that it must have apparently been written to appeal to young children.  I just am not sure whose children it was made for.  Certainly no selfrespecting cardcarrying child I know!If they HAD to remake My Favorite Martian why didn't they add some of the timeless charm of the original classic?  Unfortunately IMDB.com cannot factor in zero as a rating for its readers that is the only rating that comes to mind in describing this travesty.One good thing did come from this movie the actors and crew were paid  I think.".

I think the writer used It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World as an example of a fine comedy script.  As manic as that 1963 classic is it is far superior to this claptrap  in fact  suddenly it looks pretty good in comparison.What is most sad about this movie is that it must have apparently been written to appeal to young children.  I just am not sure whose children it was made for.  Certainly no selfrespecting cardcarrying child I know!If they HAD to remake My Favorite Martian why didn't they add some of the timeless charm of the original classic?  Unfortunately IMDB.com cannot factor in zero as a rating for its readers that is the only rating that comes to mind in describing this travesty.One good thing did come from this movie the actors and crew were paid  I think.";

In contrast in the original characters were developed and the viewers developed a feeling for Tim and Uncle Martin.

But back on subject now...Along with this tale loosely based on the 1960s television show by the same name is a sappy love story. Tim is in love with a reporter named Brace Elizabeth Hurley. The romance is put on hold at separate times during the film and so we never truly get a handle on the whole bit. Tim is in love with Brace one moment Lizzie Daryl Hannah his technician the next moment. Call it romance. Call it love. Call it manipulating the audience.The villains are all government scientists led by Coleye as in e. coli a governmentsomethingorother who is seemingly mystified and obsesses with martians. Coleye is played by Wallace Shawn whose film credits include The Princess Bride and Toy Story. I've always admired him onscreen because he is a small screen presence yet at the same time a strong one. He rarely plays a leading man and in the rare ocassion he does the film is a flop see a film of his where his kid rents a new father. Wallace Shawn is one of the most underrated yet distinguished costars out there and he demands just as much credit as the other actors on board since he does very well with his character who chases Tim and ''Uncle Martin'' because he wants to prove there is intelligent life on other planets. Uncle Martin on the other hand only wants to lay low be friends with Tim and Lizzie repair his spaceship and go home. Then he discovers ice cream and all he wants to do is eat ice cream. The side effects of ice cream are like alcohol to our bodies Uncle Martin runs around and wrecks the ice cream shop completely intoxicated. Must be the sugarrush in the vanilla and chocolate. In fact the scene where Martin wrecks the ice cream shop was shown many times on the TV spots and trailers and it made the film look more promising than the outcome.There are some good moments in ''My Favorite Martian'' including the ice cream shop segment. It looks as if everyone who made this film had a lot of fun. Christopher Lloyd and Jeff Daniels are cheery and happy the whole way through which may be a good enough reason to see this film. But as I watch it I can't help but compare it to other family films I've seen that are so many times more compelling interesting and smart than My Favorite Martian.

	schema:reviewBody "I was surprised about how much I really liked about Disney's new live action remake called My Favorite Martian. It was actionpacked well acted childish energetic and has a suitable plot. But this is supposed to be a comedy and I did not laugh very much in this picture nor did I find the majority of it very amusing. While the movie will certainly satisfy kids if I thought this film was too wide then I can't imagine the average adult surviving it.The film stars Jeff Daniels as a TV reporter named Tim O'Hara. in the movie Tim has just had a very bad day. On his way home from work he sees a bright light coming from the nighttime sky. Then what looks like an airplane crashes on the beach shore only feet from is car. In amazement and curiosity he walks over to investigate precariously.What he finds is nothing except an object that looks like a toy spaceship. He is soon joined in his search by his coworker named Brace Channing played by Elizabeth Hurley. She listens to what Tim saw investigate smokes though here cigarette on the ground thinks Tim is a nutcase and storms away disappointedly.We find out later that the toy Tim found is really an actual UFO that belongs to a creature from outer space who used a shrinking device to make it really small. The alien takes the from of a human with his special capabilities. His name becomes Uncle Martin in a state of panic and confusion trying to cover up his existence.Uncle Martin is very strange. He dresses in a galactic space suit that has feelings can talk move fight and spank people in the behind that he demonstrates in one scene several times. He also has a name Zoot. Martin also can make his favorite foods fly around an area and land in his mouth and chew gum that turns him into different life forms. If humans eat chew it however they will turn into ugly extraterrestrials.At first being a TV reporter Tim only uses Martin so he can capture his species on camera thus be responsible for the biggest story in history. But after a while the script requires him to start to like Martin and realize that the press would look him in a cell destroying his carefree life.The film has some very nice moments in it. The special effects are also first rate including scenes where a shrunken car ride into the sewer and end up in the toilet of a fat man's house who really has to go. The alien effects are also first rate. Thus My Favorite Martian is not at all a bad movie.But I have a real hard time calling it Good.".

While the movie will certainly satisfy kids if I thought this film was too wide then I can't imagine the average adult surviving it.The film stars Jeff Daniels as a TV reporter named Tim O'Hara. in the movie Tim has just had a very bad day. On his way home from work he sees a bright light coming from the nighttime sky. Then what looks like an airplane crashes on the beach shore only feet from is car. In amazement and curiosity he walks over to investigate precariously.What he finds is nothing except an object that looks like a toy spaceship. He is soon joined in his search by his coworker named Brace Channing played by Elizabeth Hurley. She listens to what Tim saw investigate smokes though here cigarette on the ground thinks Tim is a nutcase and storms away disappointedly.We find out later that the toy Tim found is really an actual UFO that belongs to a creature from outer space who used a shrinking device to make it really small. The alien takes the from of a human with his special capabilities. His name becomes Uncle Martin in a state of panic and confusion trying to cover up his existence.Uncle Martin is very strange. He dresses in a galactic space suit that has feelings can talk move fight and spank people in the behind that he demonstrates in one scene several times. He also has a name Zoot. Martin also can make his favorite foods fly around an area and land in his mouth and chew gum that turns him into different life forms. If humans eat chew it however they will turn into ugly extraterrestrials.At first being a TV reporter Tim only uses Martin so he can capture his species on camera thus be responsible for the biggest story in history. But after a while the script requires him to start to like Martin and realize that the press would look him in a cell destroying his carefree life.The film has some very nice moments in it. The special effects are also first rate including scenes where a shrunken car ride into the sewer and end up in the toilet of a fat man's house who really has to go. The alien effects are also first rate. Thus My Favorite Martian is not at all a bad movie.But I have a real hard time calling it Good.";

The Martian adopts the name 'Uncle Martin' and becomes friends with Tim whilst he fixes his ship. Unaware to Martin Tim actually wants to reveal him to the world but can he actually do that to his new friend and 'Uncle'? I was very young when this came out and at the time i loved it. I am not familiar at all with the original TV series and had never seen any of the episodes but i do know what makes a good film and this film isn't exactly a good film. The film just did not have a well built story. The film just seemed to have a lot of scenes of talking and walking around. The film was basically just following them around in their normal lives. When action did begin to pick up this was very limited and was over in a matter of minutes. The characters really didn't have much character in them. There weren't many jokes at all coming from any of them. Christopher Lloyd only seemed to play the most interesting character and did provide me with a few laughs. He had all the perfect characteristics but this still doesn't save a poorly written film.Is there an alien amongst us?  Brace Channing Elizabeth Hurley".

Hugely inspired by the groundbreaking theatrical rituals of Polish director Jerzy Grotowski DIONYSUS IN '69 as the production was named stirred up huge controversy amongst New York theatre audiences and critics alike.Although the production was directed by Richard Schechner Dionysus In '69 was created through a rehearsal process that was part democracy part anarchy part primal scream therapy. The final result was more a ritualized confrontation than conventional play which culminated in a virtual orgy of audience participation. Nudity profanity and huge amounts of stage blood were used to tremendous effect. Brian DePalma discovered the production and brought two NYU film maker friends of his into a special performance where multiple 16mm cameras were used to  archive the iconoclastic proceedings in BW. The final cut is an exercise in the split screen techniques which would eventually become DePalma's cinematic trademark.The cast shows deep commitment to their material and Bill Shepherd later known as Will Shepherd is particularly brilliant in the role of Pentheus. I will not go into the plot which should be wellknown to most college graduates but will say that the original Euripides play written about 500 B.C. deals with the myth of Dionysus and his revenge upon the city responsible for his mortal mother's death.I had the good fortune to direct Will Shepherd in my own film adaptation of THE BACCHAE produced in October of 2000 where he played Cadmus grandfather to the character he portrayed so brilliantly some thirty years before at the Performance Garage in New York.I highly recommend the film DIONYSUS if not for its filmic brilliance then at least for its documentation of one of the true theatrical marvels of the late 1960's.There are a number of 16mm prints of Dionysus floating around out there somewhere but I'm not sure what company distributes the film which is not available on video through".

Whereas with Phantom Mr. Shephard's role is an active spectator in the theatrical blood bath with Dionysus he plays a character who is duped in much the same way Bill Finley's character would be a few years down the road.And speaking of Mr. Finley you really have to wonder how idiotic the folks in Hollywood's high hills must be to pass up such a natural talent! After seeing Phantom of the Paradise a number of times I was amazed and impressed to see him in roles that are as far removed from the ambitious but naive Winslow Leach as it's possible to get! In Dionysus in '69 Bill plays the title role the mangod BacchusDionysus who plots out revenge on the family and city responsible for the killing of his mother. His villainy is so cleverly deceptive however that you couldn't help but be reminded of a unscrupulous record producer as he lures young king Pentheus and his entire kingdom to its own ruin.I'll admit that there were a couple scenes I couldn't sit through for the graphic nature but that's just me. The story over all was intriguing and had me reading Euripides' The Bacchae to find out how the play really ended. I like Bill Finley's version better.".

His villainy is so cleverly deceptive however that you couldn't help but be reminded of a unscrupulous record producer as he lures young king Pentheus and his entire kingdom to its own ruin.I'll admit that there were a couple scenes I couldn't sit through for the graphic nature but that's just me. The story over all was intriguing and had me reading Euripides' The Bacchae to find out how the play really ended. I like Bill Finley's version better.";

The two main characters are extremely well performed by Will Shepherd and William Finley. The two of them also have some great stage chemistry together.The way Brian De Palma cut this movie entirely in split screen makes the story work even better and certainly doesn't make this movie a boring one to watch. There is always something happening and the split screen help to make the story and scene's work better since you can obviously show and tell more within 2 screens than in rather just 1 of course.It's an interesting intriguing and certainly unusual project to watch.

I was not prepared for the madness odd quirks nudity that was put forth.Does it sound weird? This film doesn't lend itself for easy review because it's a surreal personal adaptation of an old ancient Greek play that I haven't read yet and thus can not fully say what who this is about.It simply is a group people doing experimental theater that doesn't suit everyone but gives the viewer an explosion of wild improvisation crazy behaviour and a performance of an ancient Greek play that few have seen before.The audience is also a part of this performance with actors talking directly to them hiding among them etc. The film is using splitscreenfilmed by handheld cameras throughout the performance which makes it even harder to follow everything that happens but offers a more intimate look and conveys an feeling of participation to the viewer.Many viewers will regard this film as an pretentious arthouse film others like me will probably like this surreal symphony of human emotion. Regardless it serves as a fine time capsule on how experimental theater looked 19601970's.".

	schema:reviewBody "Alice Tate Mia Farrow is living in New York City married to Doug William Hurt a man from a wealthy family. They have two kids a lavish condo and domestic employees. Alice eats caviar spends her days shopping getting manicures and pedicures and so on. However she's not very happy. She's even been thinking about having an affair. When she finally goes to see an acupuncturist Dr. Yang Keye Luke on several friends' advice because her back is bothering her he tells her that her problem is in her head not her back. Through his extremely unorthodox treatments Alice gradually transforms her life.Although there is a fair amount of light humor in Alice and it is relatively upbeat and hopeful the bulk of this film is much more in the vein of directorwriter Woody Allen's more serious straightforward dramas ala Interiors 1978 September 1987 and Another Woman 1988. Interestingly Allen has a strong fantastical thread running through Alice at the same time and it references a number of literary classicsboth thematically and occasionally in terms of more literal contentresulting in a kinship also with Allen's A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy 1982.At its heart Alice is a film about awakening and then achieving authenticity. It is told with a nod to Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol 1843 which is even supported by the appearance of O TannenbaumWe Wish You A Merry Christmas by Liberace on the soundtrack at one point with slight references also to Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland 1865 and other fantasy literature including J.M. Barrie's Peter Pan 1911.The catalyst through all of Alice's revelations is Dr. Yang whose slightly rundown Chinatown office is symbolic of Alice periodically making trips to another world for enlightenment or making repeated treks to pose questions to a metaphorical Oracle at Delphi. Dr. Yang's treatments are designed to address the various ways in which Alice needs to open up the various emotional needs she must come to terms with.It is interesting to note especially after Allen's The Curse of the Jade Scorpion 2001 that the initial spark for Alice's transformation is provided by hypnotism as that device appears for the same ultimate purpose in Curse. This probably has some significance for Allen outside of his life in film although it is difficult to say whether its because he's undergone hypnotic treatment himself or whether he just sees it as a metaphor for digging beneath public facades which one has fooled oneself into believing too.Dr. Yang's treatments either result in encountering some important person or event from Alice's past andor tapping into some unrealized potential. The encounters are often not with real persons. They can be memories made almost literal ghosts or hallucinations. These are the most direct parallel to A Christmas Carol. As in that story eventually Dr. Yang's treatments lead Alice away from an embrace of materialism for its own sake to an appreciation of more humanist values. Of course Allen makes it a bit more complex than this so that the positive transformation also has an impact on personal relationships that could be seen as negative as well.Alice is also remarkable for its cinematography which is usually symbolic of the dramatic scenarios. Sometimes this is very overt as when Dr. Yang's office transforms into an amusement park midway the slowly strobing red light was particularly exquisite with red also symbolizing caution and often it is subtler as with the tracking shots of Alice and Vicki Judy Davis seen through various glasslike surfaces or Alice and Joe Joe Mantegna through a fence as prison bars or Alice and Dr. Yang with a wall in between them as the camera pans from one to the other and so on.Of course the performances are goodAllen can even get admirable performances out of actors whom I usually do not care for such as William Hurt. Of course most of the dialogue can easily be imagined as emerging from Allen's mouth instead of whatever character happens to be on screen. And of course the music selection is a fine collection of mostly prebop classic jazz. In other words this is a typical postAnnie Hall 1977 Allen film so if you like his style Alice is a safe bet and if you already know you dislike his style you're probably not even reading this far.".

A fecund imagination married to a masterful storytelling talent.Like 'The Purple Rose of Cairo' his masterpiece in my estimation this is pure fantasy and it is delightful. Mia Farrow has done nothing finer equal to her portrayal in Polanski's 'Rosemary's Baby' though of a completely different genre.The little sociopolitical messages do not interfere with what is otherwise a nifty little love story between Alice and Joe Mantagna. Things don't quite work out in the end as is usual in a Woody movie but they are on the border of reallife possibility and add the bittersweet note that he is so good at.I love this movie. It is not one of his rocking comedies like 'Broadway Danny Rose' but is a sweet vignette. It has overtones of 'Diary of Mad Housewife' but with a happier ending for the housewife anyway.The scenes with Keye Luke Alice's magical Eastern physician are subtle and funny. The fantasy scenes with Alec Baldwin's dead lover and the wonderful Bernadette Peters' muse are enchanting. Peters' Bronxlike muse is especially funny.Don't miss it.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is Mia Farrow's most magical moment.  She glows in this film and as Woody Allen doesn't appear in it and the film is not a heavy drama like Interiors or Another Woman it will appeal to most audiences.  The plot dabbles in mysticism and magic similar to A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy and his segment in New York Stories and is basically the story of a pampered woman in search of her identity.  As Farrow's Alice is onscreen nearly every moment the film couldn't have a better title.  Alice begins to question her religious faith amidst an upperclass Manhattan setting and intellectual friendsin other words she plays a female Catholic version of the character Woody Allen has played in many other movies.  There are not a lot of laughs in the movie but it still remains a classy winner and a good start to Allen's '90s career.  The big name cast with the exception of William Hurt and Joe Mantegna contribute cameo appearances more or less a casting move he would continue later in the decade.  Not a movie that lends itself to countless viewings like Manhattan or The Purple Rose of Cairo but a definite charmer.".

	schema:reviewBody "Alice is a happily married uppereast side NY mother who has children a maid a babysitter and so on.  She never thought she was unhappy until she meets a man at her children's school and begins thinking about having an affair with him.  She goes to an herbal doctor Dr Yang who gives her herbs that in a variety of ways help her in her voyage of selfdiscovery.I'm a keen fan of Woody Allen but hopefully not to the point where I can't call a dog a dog!  This film is not a dog but it is certainly very lifeless and dull despite the imaginative plot device of Dr Yang's herbs.  For one thing it is very difficult indeed to really care for Alice or her friends. Usually Allen manages to get over this by making them witty deeper characters of just having his film move slickly.  Here he can't get the pace up nor does he manage to give Alice anything resembling a real problem  unless you live the selfobsessed type of life she lives in which case you may disagree.  I struggled to really get into the story and it was only made harder by the fact that although imaginative the film wasn't really that funny.The dialogue lacked the sort of imaginative sparkle that Allen films can usually be relied upon to have and it seemed to rely more on character than anything  which was a mistake as they are a fairly unsympathetic lot with more money than problems.  Farrow tries her best to win the audience round but I never got more from Alice than a woman going through a midlife crisis of sorts.  Mantegna and Hurt are both good actors but here they have nothing really to do and appear hamstrung by their characters.  The only time I connected with Alice was when she danced with the ghost of her husband and we hear flashbacks to their marriage  at this point I saw a person.  This is mostly due to a good performance by Baldwin in a minor role.Overall this is typical Allen and I guess fans may love it for that.  For me I really didn't feel the film had any life to it and that it came across as flat and listless.  The plot relies on characters who I couldn't either relate to or like the dialogue isn't as funny as it should be even though the invisibility etc all make it seem more interesting.  It's an OK film but I couldn't help but feel disappointed with the whole thing.".

He doesn't always make strict comedies though and this movie proves it.Mia Farrow and William Hurt are married have two children and live the highlife. But Mia in the title role is unsatisfied and she doesn't know why. She visits a Chinese acupuncturist to help with some back pain and enters a journey of selfdiscovery.Mia does a wonderful job in this slightly offbeat flick. Just as in The Purple Rose of Cairo when she rises above an unhappy marriage and finds herself she expresses curiosity sadness hope and invigoration all at the right times. I happen to be a Mia Farrow fan so I was expecting to like this movie but my mom doesn't like her nearly as much as I do and she still really enjoyed Alice. As always in Woody Allen movies there's a large cast and this one includes Alec Baldwin Blythe Danner Cybill Shepherd Joe Montegna June Squibb Julie Kavner Bernadette Peters Gwen Verdon and Bob Balaban. Alice is thoughtful and sweet and a great movie to watch when you're pondering the universe.".

	schema:reviewBody "Alice is not Woody Allen at his best and admittedly I was expecting a little more from it after the brilliant Crimes and Misdemeanorswhich is top 5 Allen from the previous year. There are far better developed more interesting and more identifiable characters in other Allen films here some were underwritten and a couple like William Hurt's a touch irritating the titular character was relatively welldeveloped though. Some of the actors are underused like Hurt and Judy Davis and Mia Farrow does start off a little too stylised and soft which doesn't make her transformation quite as believable as it could have been. However quite quickly she becomes very touching and her deadpan comic delivery really shines through so while with not as strong a start it's actually a good performance. Joe Mantegna turns out good work too although to a lesser extent he could have been better used while Keye Luke Cybill Shepherd and particularly Bernadette Peters and Alec Baldwinin the most colourful supporting roles make up an excellent supporting cast. Allen's direction is just right the film looks beautiful with a dreamlike quality at times and the soundtrack is hypnotic. The script and story are a mix of comedy drama and fantasy all three balanced well and all three work with the comedy lighthearted and subtly witty the drama affecting and not overwrought and the fantasy whimsical and nostalgicfeeling. Working out what was going on and what the film was trying to do and be wasn't a problem for me and Alice ends cleverly and poignantly. All in all a lovely film if not as good as his late 70s80s films and a good start to Allen's 90s output though better was to come from that decadeHusbands and Wives Manhattan Murder Mystery and Bullets Over Broadway. 810 Bethany Cox".

This thought wasn't helped by my 10 Allen films in 3 days marathon.Case in point  Alice. I knew that something was up when a lovely version of La Cumparsita started playing in the background teasing you with it's backandforth melody. Alice is a delightful tale that manipulates you with its pacing  lingering on seemingly mundane moments and whisking you away from deliberate flights of fancy e.g. the afternoon of invisibility with Alec Baldwin that leave you wanting much more.

The biggest fault I find with this film is Mia Farrow. Her run of films with Woody Allen are among his best and her contributions are immense. Here she just seems unconvincing as a wealthy upperEastsider. Yes we meet her character while she's questioning her life but somehow the hat the hair the shoes just aren't sophisticated enough for a woman who's been living that lifestyle. She lacks the hardboiled edge of a seasoned New Yorker. Because she's too soft right from the beginning her transformation falls short.

The movie is full of refreshing originality and great Text. Woody Allen Prooves himself here as a true artist and a true master in writing scripts and of course great dialogs. The cast is amazing and Mia Farrow plays a convincing and powerful role. The movie stands in the thin line between realistic and magical Beetwin story and Fairytale. Woody did this touch of fantasy with much skill as a writer and as a Director. The storytelling style touches Shakespeare. I personally think this movie is one of Woody Allen's greatest pieces along with The Purple Rose Of Cairo and Great Aphrodite.

	schema:headline " Woody Allen's version of magic realism";
	schema:reviewBody "Alice can be seen as Woody Allen's version of magic realism. It makes use of magic but does so not in the context of myth fairytale or fantasy but in the context of contemporary reallife America. The title character Alice Tate is an uppermiddleclass New York housewife. Alice is married with two children but her marriage is not a happy one. Her husband Doug is wealthy and goodlooking but cold dull and unresponsive to her needs. The film explores what happens two strangers come into Alice's life. The first is Joe Ruffalo a handsome musician to whom she finds herself attracted. The second is the mysterious Chinese herbalist Dr Yang who is treating her for backache. Dr Yang prescribes a series of herbal treatments for her but it is clear that these are much more than just backache remedies. Indeed these herbs have magical properties. One type takes away her inhibitions and make her act on her feelings towards Joe another type makes her invisible enabling her to watch both Joe and Doug unseen. A third enables her to communicate with the ghost of her now deceased first lover Ed. The film is very different in its overall tone to Woody's previous offering Crimes and Misdemeanours made a year earlier. Yet there is also a similarity between the two films. Alice can be seen as continuing the debate about religion which began in the earlier film Given that Woody is normally thought of as a religious sceptic Crimes and Misdemeanours came as something of a surprise to me with its positive view of religion especially the sympathetic view taken of Sam Waterston's Rabbi a man whose religious faith enables him to bear the prospect of blindness with stoicism. Although physically he is losing his sight morally he can see more clearly than any other character in that film. In Alice the religious debate takes place in the context of Catholicism rather than Judaism. Although she no longer practises her religion Alice was raised as a Catholic. As was Mia Farrow who plays her Mia's original name was the very Catholic Maria de Lourdes VilliersFarrow. The film's view of Catholicism is a mixed one. One the one hand Alice's Catholic upbringing is seen as a source of sexual guilt. On the other hand Catholicism is also seen as a source of humanitarian idealism. As a girl and young woman Alice's was to help people like Mother Theresa whom she greatly admired. As a middleaged married woman she has lost sight of her idealistic goals and leads a luxurious materialistic lifestyle dominated by shopping beauty treatments and gossip. Religion can therefore be seen as being the partial cause of Alice's problems in that it causes her to feel guilty about her feelings for Joe. There is a suggestion that her backache is psychosomatically linked to these guilt feelings. It can however also be seen as part of the solution to those problems as she eventually rediscovers her earlier idealism. Another link between this film and Crimes and Misdemeanours lies in their colour schemes. In the earlier film the predominant colours were browns greys and dull yellows and oranges. Here similar colours predominate except that they are also relieved by brighter oranges and reds. This may have been intended to symbolise the difference in tone between the two films. Crimes.. is one of Woody's darker films combining humorous and serious stories although even the humour is often of a dark cynical nature. Alice by contrast is generally lighter and more playful a comedy raising serious issues as opposed to a serious film lightened by humour. Magical realism in the cinema is not always successful Practical Magic for example which likewise tried to introduce magical elements into a modernday realistic setting is a hopeless mess of a film one of my leastfavourite movies of the nineties. Alice is a considerably better film than Practical Magic it would be difficult to be worse but I nevertheless got the feeling that Woody was never entirely happy with his supernatural subjectmatter and does not handle it as deftly as he did in for example The Purple Rose of Cairo another film of his which includes fantasy elements. Although this is not her best collaboration with Allen that was probably Hannah and Her Sisters Mia Farrow makes a likable heroine and there are also good performances from Alec Baldwin as the ghostly Ed and William Hurt as Doug. Overall this is a generally enjoyable film with some amusing scenes but it does not really count as one of Allen's great works. 610".

	schema:reviewBody "I love a lot of Woody Allen's lesserknown works Shadows and Fog Stardust Memories but being honest with myself I can't find a lot to like in Alice. The one thing that kept me watching it the whole way through was Mia Farrow's phenomenal performance  she's really at her best here and with no Woody around she truly gets to shine. The script is also wonderful as is almost everything Allen wrote at least until the early 2000's. Unfortunately the film is too uneven to really work. Farrow's one woman show controls most of it but the rest of the cast can't keep up  especially the completely uncharismatic Joe Mantegna who brings down every production he's in. Stylistically the film has some very interesting moments but it too is too inconsistent and uneven. In particular any scene of a supernatural nature comes off as indecisive and cynical. The film is probably worth it for devoted Woody Allen fans some of them may like it but I can't really recommend it for anybody else.".

The one thing that kept me watching it the whole way through was Mia Farrow's phenomenal performance  she's really at her best here and with no Woody around she truly gets to shine. The script is also wonderful as is almost everything Allen wrote at least until the early 2000's. Unfortunately the film is too uneven to really work. Farrow's one woman show controls most of it but the rest of the cast can't keep up  especially the completely uncharismatic Joe Mantegna who brings down every production he's in.

No one really thinks he can act and the only reason he has a career in the movies is because he can do all those things and because women swoon over him.  Being the quintessential guy I am pretty much in the category of guys that likes to see him in films that are loaded with kicks to the head and punches to the stomach.  It is a guy thing to want to see guys like Van Damme Arnold Sly and Seagal kick some major butt.  But I have to admit that as much as I like some of his films that are action and nothing but this film really blew me away.  I was completely convinced with the love story and I felt for the characters.  Jean Claude gives his best performance in here.  And the sript being written by Eszetheras is perfect.  This is a film that relies more on character and dialogue than it does kickboxing skills.  And perhaps that alienates die hard Van Damme fans but for the rest of the audience out there this is a great step in the right direction.  I have heard people that love his smashmouth style of film say that this is a more tame Van Damme and they don't like it that much but when your films only gross about the same amount as a typical Friday the 13th film it's safe to say that there is room to grow and Nowhere to Run is definitely growth.  The only reason that people didn't go to see it is because it is Van Damme.  But this has so much more to offer than just your typical action flick.  The romance is fresh and Kieran Culkin is excellent as the young tyke who grows attached to Van Damme.  It's just too bad Claude couldn't make more movies like this one because I really think people would warm up to this style of movie from him and eventually his box office appeal would grow.  But as long he continues to make movies like Universal Soldier 2 and Knock Off he will forever be stuck in that mold.Nowhere to Run is a great film and when it came out in 1993 I remember making out my list for the ten best films that year and yes this one was on it.  I highly recommend it.  I think you will be surprised.  However if you are hard core and like to see his films with lots of kicks and blood and cheesy lines from guys like Bolo Yeung then don't go see this one it is too much of a movie for you to enjoy.".

Why else would anyone go to see a Van Damme picture?The last film I came to was Nowhere to Run. Having not seen it in a good ten years and remembering it as slowpaced indulgent and severely lacking in arsekicking I was not really expecting to be at all impressed. It's funny looking through most of the reviews here that two groups of people have clearly emerged. The first group the Van Damme fans are all complaining that this is not your average VD film and bitching about how they were cheated into watching a serious drama.The other group are all up in arms at the fact that anyone would make a serious drama and cast Van Damme in it. I have a name for this group but I doubt IMDb would publish it. Let's just call them wnkers. Why the wnkers who clearly have an abundant dislike for the Muscles from Brussells would go to see a film with his name above the title is beyond me. Cinesnobs have no place at a Van Damme show. I'll leave it at that.The reason I felt compelled to write this review is that I am admittedly a bit of a Cinesnob but I'm also happy to take a film for what it is. I like James Bond I like Sonny Chiba I like blaxploitation and I also fricking like Van Damme movies! What I did not expect was for a serious drama starring Van Damme trying saying that out loud without snickering to be so Damme good! Get it?The story is pretty simple JC is an escaped con who happens upon a sleepy little town which is about to be pulverised by a nihilistic land developer not surprisingly a British one played with appropriate menace by Joss Ackland. He befriends a little boy not in the Michael Jackson way though the boy in question is ironically Macaulay Culkin's younger brother Kieran and consequently gets rather chummy with the boy's mother. Happily she is both widowed and incredibly hot. As if her being a still distraught widow weren't enough she is also being harassed to a rather unreasonable degree by Ted Levine who is hilarious and brilliant and the land developer's chief henchman. Cue Van Damme.Sounds like the ideal recipe for another typical action flick so I am willing to forgive those VD fans who felt cheated. What we actually end up with is a genuinely moving well paced and hugely enjoyable action drama. It may sound unthinkable but JC actually pulls his character off perfectly. Sam is mistrusting awkward but ultimately striving to be a decent person. Director Mark Harmon made a very savvy decision in keeping JC's dialogue to a minimum leaving him the task of creating a believable character with his face and body language alone. Don't believe the naysayers JC delivers a truly surprising performance.Rosanna Arquette also handles her role well even if the character is flying dangerously close to stereotype. Her performance grounds the whole story and we both care for her plight and admire her determination the men in the audience will also admire her perfectly formed seminaked body. The two kids were bound to be annoying but they're certainly nowhere close to being as bad as they could have been.The real star of this film is the consistently beautiful cinematography by the relatively unknown David Gribble. With scenery like this you'd be hard pressed to go wrong with the external stuff but the interiors are equally well shot.The big let down both in terms of cinematography and the film as a whole is the truly lame action. There are only a handful of action sequences in the whole show but they're easily the dullest moments in the film. When you have a good story solid characters and a really wellcast group of fine actors do you really need to throw in a bunch of crappy fights? Sadly if you're selling this as a Van Damme picture the answer is yes. So they had the courage to put JC in a serious role and give him the chance to prove that he can actually act but they didn't have the balls to actually sell the film on this basis. The trailer says Van Damme as you've never seen him before and then just gives us a bunch of poor action clips. Is it any wonder that nobody who actually bothered to see this film liked it?If it weren't bad enough that the action scenes are badly shot and clumsily edited they're also punctuated by really poor oneliners from JC Strike 3 you're out! and Au revoir fker are among the worst. One gets the feeling that there were differences in the opinions of the director and the star and the opinions of the producers and studio folk. Presumably someone thought they had found a happy balance. Someone was wrong and the film really suffers as a consequence.If you can overlook this and you're not watching the film either to complain that it's not a solid action flick or to complain that Van Damme is in a drama you'll probably find yourself surprisingly impressed with the film.".

The sparse fight sequences don't involve any weird Van Damme midair splitkicks to the head they're straightahead brawls.

There is a good amount of action some strong performances and some very funny moments. Van Damme plays Sam a mysterious convict who has escaped from prison. He sleeps in a tent outside a small town where two local young kids find and befriend him. Eventually their mother Clydie played by Rosanna Arquette finds out and invites him into their home cautiously. Of course they fall for each other much to the distaste of local Sheriff and love interest Lonnie who decides to look into Sam's background. Franklin Hale played with typical evil by Ackland is the main bad guy but his sidearm Levine is the main threat. Sam helps the family foiling Hale at every turn but the past is catching up with Sam...Arquette Culkin Levine and Taubman as the daughter are particularly good and the story tries to be lighthearted and moral. It may be another attempt to achieve a wider audience for Van Damme and it is definitely one of his most accessible thanks to the good cast and humour. The various discussions on Van Damme's naked body are always humorous. Overall another good Van Damme film which will please fans and may interest a few others.7.5 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a brilliant absolutely brilliant Van Damme film with an amazing performances and a very emotional ending!. This Is one of Van Damme's absolute best and in my top 5 plus this may be Van Damme's breakout performance as an actor in my opinion although he is always amazing. I really liked how Van Damme tried to do something different here and in my opinion it worked perfectly and Van Damme and Arquette have amazing chemistry together plus it was awesome to see how well Van Damme bonded with the kids!. I can't believe critics called this embarrassing and if you think Van Damme can't act you have to watch this movie plus Joss Ackland is pretty menacing as the main villain!. The character development is outstanding and the kids are surprisingly very likable plus the movie has a couple of good scraps!. This is a brilliant absolutely brilliant Van Damme film with amazing performances and a very emotional ending. The Direction is fantastic!. Robert Harmon does a fantastic job here with fantastic camera work good angles creating some nice atmosphere and keeping the film at an extremely engrossing and very fast pace!. There is a tiny bit of blood. We get a couple a very bloody gunshot wounds and minor wounds. The Acting is AMAZING! in my opinion. Jean Claude Van Damme is AMAZING as always and is AMAZING here he is extremely convincing extremely likable kicks that ass had amazing chemistry with the kids and Rosanna Arquetteand gave one of the best performance in his career! Van Damme Is quite simply the Man!my favorite actor. Rosanna Arquette is wonderful here she is beautiful had amazing chemistry with Van Damme was very likable and like VD's character i was rooting for her all the way!. Kieran Culkin is actually very good as the kid and was very likable and was actually quite funny go figure!.Ted Levine is very good as one of the main villains and was very menacing. Joss Ackland is also excellent as one of the main villains didn't have much screen time though. Tiffany Taubman is great as the daughter and was adorable. Edward Blatchford is good as the weasel sheriff. Overall this quite simply a must see period! don't waste any more time!.  out of 5".

	schema:reviewBody "Simply put Il Secondo Tragico Fantozzi is a masterpiece. I feel myself sorry while commenting on this movie for two main reasons the first being that this movie was never exported to the States nor to many other foreign countries. I've seen very bad Italian movies exported to the US where I live and it's a shame that nobody can check this out here. The second complaint is about the quality of the sequels. While the first three movies of the Fantozzi series  this is the second one  are good to great the rest is a downhill ride to stupidity and badlyrecycled jokes... sorta like Police Academy only worse. Enough... now let's talk about the movie...Well... just to put it clear this is easily one of my favorite comedies of all time far better than some overrated overhyped American comedies such as There's Something About Mary. It's hard to explain how absolutely hilarious and crazy the movie is... you can think about it as Al Bundy meets the Pink Panther sortameets Monty Phyton but that still doesn't do justice to the movie. Ugo Fantozzi is a worker in a major Italian Company that makes EVERYTHING. Everyone in the movie is crazy... not just a little bit... everyone is LITERALLY a nut his own way. Plus Fantozzi is very unlucky. This leads him to a ton of catastrophic situations him being the victim. When he goes to hunt people behave like they're at war there's even a delicious scene involving The Battleship Potemkin which might well be one of the most hilarious I've ever seen in a comedy. The scene leads to what's probably Fantozzi's most famous quote ever Per me... La Corazzata Potemkin... E' UNA CAGATA PAZZESCA! To me... The Battleship Potemkin... IS CRAZY BULLST!  you should see the movie to understand why he's so mad at that. There's not really a story... it's rather a sequence of absurd situations in which Fantozzi gets involved mainly because of his bosses and his coworkers.  It's a glimpse at the Italian office life of the 70s with every flaw of the system inflated to a monster... an absolutely hilarious one...In the end although Fantozzi is not really smart nor sympathetic you end up respecting him for being the only person that has some integrity.If you ever have the opportunity you should check this out. This would be my first choice for a Fantozzi movie with the first Fantozzi as a second choice. Those are the only two directed by Luciano Salce and the next sequels are definitely inferior. ABSOLUTELY avoid any Fantozzi movie past 1985.910".

I feel myself sorry while commenting on this movie for two main reasons the first being that this movie was never exported to the States nor to many other foreign countries. I've seen very bad Italian movies exported to the US where I live and it's a shame that nobody can check this out here. The second complaint is about the quality of the sequels. While the first three movies of the Fantozzi series  this is the second one  are good to great the rest is a downhill ride to stupidity and badlyrecycled jokes... sorta like Police Academy only worse. Enough... now let's talk about the movie...Well... just to put it clear this is easily one of my favorite comedies of all time far better than some overrated overhyped American comedies such as There's Something About Mary. It's hard to explain how absolutely hilarious and crazy the movie is... you can think about it as Al Bundy meets the Pink Panther sortameets Monty Phyton but that still doesn't do justice to the movie. Ugo Fantozzi is a worker in a major Italian Company that makes EVERYTHING. Everyone in the movie is crazy... not just a little bit... everyone is LITERALLY a nut his own way. Plus Fantozzi is very unlucky. This leads him to a ton of catastrophic situations him being the victim. When he goes to hunt people behave like they're at war there's even a delicious scene involving The Battleship Potemkin which might well be one of the most hilarious I've ever seen in a comedy. The scene leads to what's probably Fantozzi's most famous quote ever Per me... La Corazzata Potemkin... E' UNA CAGATA PAZZESCA! To me... The Battleship Potemkin... IS CRAZY BULLST!  you should see the movie to understand why he's so mad at that. There's not really a story... it's rather a sequence of absurd situations in which Fantozzi gets involved mainly because of his bosses and his coworkers.  It's a glimpse at the Italian office life of the 70s with every flaw of the system inflated to a monster... an absolutely hilarious one...In the end although Fantozzi is not really smart nor sympathetic you end up respecting him for being the only person that has some integrity.If you ever have the opportunity you should check this out. This would be my first choice for a Fantozzi movie with the first Fantozzi as a second choice. Those are the only two directed by Luciano Salce and the next sequels are definitely inferior. ABSOLUTELY avoid any Fantozzi movie past 1985.910";

	schema:reviewBody "This is truly one of the best Italian favorite comedies. It is too bad these movies have never been released in the States. Fantozzi movies are pure satire about the work life in a northern Italian corporation in the late 70's.  A characteristic of the movie is that Paolo VillaggioFantozzi also narrates the events with a unique dramatic tone of voice....must hear to appreciate it!Ugo Fantozzi is a frustrated  accountant of  a big old fashioned corporation structured like a royal divine  hierarchy where Fantozzi is at the bottom of it.Fantozzi at work and at homeis disrespected teased and mocked by his coworkers but he humbly takes all the crap with resignation.   He is also doomed by an unbelievable bad luck which is displayed by a stormy cloud over his head.  To add to the misfortune his family life isn't better either. His wife is ugly and his daughter played by a young man is even uglier. Fantozzi tries to escape this reality by dreaming romantics randevouz with one of the females coworkers Sig.na Silvani....which of course could care less about him.All the characters in the movies are really crazy and unique. The Divine MegaPresident of the corporation is  the craziest one of all... he has  an aquarium made of chosen employees up in his ultra modern office penthhouse.The movies don't have a plot but a series of short comical scenes that show Fantozzi frustrations  in the beginning but as the movie goes on will peak with Fantozzi rebellion to the corporation's rules and finally end with Fantozzi defeat and surrender to the corporation's Creator. These comedy is very intelligently written and is very original. A truly enjoyable movie.".

I also cannot understand why a movie that supposedly is one of the finest Italian comedies has only three reviewers. So let's start from there.Fantozzi is not a nice man. He is just as petty selfish and insane as the other protagonists. The only thing he is got going for him is that he is the lowest of them. In his tragicomic attempts to upgrade his level in the corporate hierarchy a fake value system that overwhelms everything including his personal life he goes further and further down on the scale of human beings. That is why I had a lot of trouble empathizing with the guy since I am so wonderful indeed. However that is not the point of the movie and if I can presume that much I would say that Fantozzi is not a real character only a tool in this satire of the northern Italian capitalism of the 70's.The best American analogy I can think of is Charlie Chaplin's Modern Times but focused more on the perceived status of each person. Runaway classism where everybody fends for themselves and the owner of the corporation that produces everything and employs everybody is God Fantozzi's world is funny only through the absurdity of the situation but mostly tragical because of the reality it satires.Bottom line Fantozzi is a piece of Italian culture. Italians laugh at it because they were raised with Fantozzi films. Also some of the language puns and implications are lost on other people. However this film is well done well acted and has some scenes that are fantastically complex. I can't say that I was terribly amused by it though partly because I understood the horrible world it described and that still rears its ugly head in our lives even today and partly because the character is a stupid selfish man with whom I could not really connect. On a more shallow level though one can laugh at the absurdity of the situations brilliantly pushed over the top by the makers.".

	schema:headline " A crafty mystery thanks to Claude Chabrol and Philippe Noiret with a satisfying last line for game show hosts";
	schema:reviewBody "With Claude Chabrol's Masques we have mystery in the country manor with perhaps murder in the country manner. But was there a murder and if so who did the murdering? Chabrol leads us to the easy conclusion reassures us then let's us consider the thought that there might be other possibilities. It's far better for a director's reputation that he or she turn out turgid serious films than well crafted entertainments. Claude Chabrol is a case in point. Although his more serious films are scarcely turgid it is his many films over the last 35 years or so most of which can easily be called entertainments at least by me that sometimes cause a condescending sniff. It's nearly impossible to read comments about a Chabrol film without seeing yet another reference to his French New Wave credentials  of over 40 years ago  or to that tired old clich of Chabrol being France's answer to Hitchcock. I admire Chabrol for one simple reason. In a long career he has continued to make movie after movie year after year and good ones. While most of his peers have died or took themselves too seriously or wandered about or didn't produce much Chabrol has just kept busy making movies...all kinds of movies mysteries murders comedies satires dramas. He can be serious about serious things if it suits him but more often he can be amusing about serious things. His movies are literate and nearly always depend upon the mood Chabrol creates around the plot. It's clear that he's not impressed by authority figures or the conventions of smoothrunning society. He's not above a bit of gruesome shock. Occasionally he can be unsettling even sad. Occasionally he'll produce a dud or a half dud. Through it all he keeps making movies. It seems to me that if one accepts that motion pictures are above all popular entertainment then having one's films praised as entertainment  literate entertainment  should be seen as high praise. Chabrol is one of the great craftsmen of movie making one with a point of view and one with whom some fine actors want to work. And that brings us back to Masques another of Claude Chabrol's literate entertainments this one with that great actor Philippe Noiret. Christian Lagagneur Noiret is the ebullient host of a popular television game show. On a pink set with a rickytick band playing rickytick music Lagagneur hosts elderly couples who must perform a song or a dance and then they're voted upon to see which couple wins the trip of a lifetime. He agrees to have Roland Wolf Robin Renucci write his biography. He invites Wolf to a weekend at his country manor where they'll work together. At the manor are Lagagneur's secretary Colette a smiling watchful woman along with his livein masseuse and her husband who looks after the wine. The cook is also the chauffeur a man who is mute. Max had tongue cancer which metastasized into his ears explains Lagagneur to Wolf. There also is Catherine a pale thin young woman who wears dark glasses in the house. Catherine is Lagagneur's ward and godchild. She is a minor but just barely. We know something's up when Wolf unpacking in his room removes a revolver from his valise and hides it away in a closet and then discovers a lipstick. He looks at it carefully and then writes a large M on the mirror. He murmurs Madeleine and then wipes it off. It's not long before we discover Madeline was a houseguest too who left suddenly in the night. We witness Lagagneur's solicitude for Catherine his insistence that doctors not see her because of the damage they caused earlier his concern that she take the pills Colette crushes and mixes in her tea. We also witness Catherine's instability her mood swings and her unexpected passions. Wolf interviews Lagagneur records everything and at night discovers secrets.

	onyx:emotionText "With Claude Chabrol's Masques we have mystery in the country manor with perhaps murder in the country manner. But was there a murder and if so who did the murdering? Chabrol leads us to the easy conclusion reassures us then let's us consider the thought that there might be other possibilities. It's far better for a director's reputation that he or she turn out turgid serious films than well crafted entertainments. Claude Chabrol is a case in point. Although his more serious films are scarcely turgid it is his many films over the last 35 years or so most of which can easily be called entertainments at least by me that sometimes cause a condescending sniff. It's nearly impossible to read comments about a Chabrol film without seeing yet another reference to his French New Wave credentials  of over 40 years ago  or to that tired old clich of Chabrol being France's answer to Hitchcock. I admire Chabrol for one simple reason. In a long career he has continued to make movie after movie year after year and good ones. While most of his peers have died or took themselves too seriously or wandered about or didn't produce much Chabrol has just kept busy making movies...all kinds of movies mysteries murders comedies satires dramas. He can be serious about serious things if it suits him but more often he can be amusing about serious things. His movies are literate and nearly always depend upon the mood Chabrol creates around the plot. It's clear that he's not impressed by authority figures or the conventions of smoothrunning society. He's not above a bit of gruesome shock. Occasionally he can be unsettling even sad. Occasionally he'll produce a dud or a half dud. Through it all he keeps making movies. It seems to me that if one accepts that motion pictures are above all popular entertainment then having one's films praised as entertainment  literate entertainment  should be seen as high praise. Chabrol is one of the great craftsmen of movie making one with a point of view and one with whom some fine actors want to work. And that brings us back to Masques another of Claude Chabrol's literate entertainments this one with that great actor Philippe Noiret. Christian Lagagneur Noiret is the ebullient host of a popular television game show. On a pink set with a rickytick band playing rickytick music Lagagneur hosts elderly couples who must perform a song or a dance and then they're voted upon to see which couple wins the trip of a lifetime. He agrees to have Roland Wolf Robin Renucci write his biography. He invites Wolf to a weekend at his country manor where they'll work together. At the manor are Lagagneur's secretary Colette a smiling watchful woman along with his livein masseuse and her husband who looks after the wine. The cook is also the chauffeur a man who is mute. Max had tongue cancer which metastasized into his ears explains Lagagneur to Wolf. There also is Catherine a pale thin young woman who wears dark glasses in the house. Catherine is Lagagneur's ward and godchild. She is a minor but just barely. We know something's up when Wolf unpacking in his room removes a revolver from his valise and hides it away in a closet and then discovers a lipstick. He looks at it carefully and then writes a large M on the mirror. He murmurs Madeleine and then wipes it off. It's not long before we discover Madeline was a houseguest too who left suddenly in the night. We witness Lagagneur's solicitude for Catherine his insistence that doctors not see her because of the damage they caused earlier his concern that she take the pills Colette crushes and mixes in her tea. We also witness Catherine's instability her mood swings and her unexpected passions. Wolf interviews Lagagneur records everything and at night discovers secrets. Whatever is going to happen in this manor house over the weekend we can be sure death will be involved. Philippe Noiret dominates the movie just as his character Christian Lagagneur dominates the manor house and the game show. Lagagneur is relentlessly full of bon homme. His overwhelming small talk gives nothing away. His charm at first can seem genuine. Noiret whether prancing about the television stage embracing an old woman dressed in her best glancing at his cue cards and mouthing aggressive patter about the delights of old age or playing chess in a dark room while measuring with drooping eye lids the possible motives of Wolf is sheer pleasure.

Essentially a detective story of Roland who's sister has disappeared in mysterious circumstances. His investigations lead him to her last known whereabouts  the country home of game show host Christian Legagneur. Roland poses as a journalist under the pretext of interviewing Legagneur for a book. Here he meets and falls in love with Legagneur's god daughter Catherine. Is it she who holds the key to the disappearance of Roland's sister? Watch the film to find out.'Masques' is probably not one of Chabrol's finest but interesting none the less. Certainly worth a look for both Anne Brochet as the child like Catherine and Philippe Noiret's wonderfully over the top performance as the game show host. As in all Chabrol films people are never quite what they seem. Unfortanately the villain of the piece is revealed a tad too early in this one.

Evoking Walter Matthau to a striking degree he manages all of the protagonist's various facets transmitting in this way his talent for manipulation  going from the charm he exercises on audiences and collaborators alike to the tenderness he demonstrates towards his young female charge whom he ostensibly took on out of compassion after both her parents perished in a car crash the ruthlessness he eventually adopts in order to achieve his goals and ultimately the breakdown he suffers 'on air' exposing him for the contemptuous bully he really is.The plot sees a young reporter apparently approach Noiret for the purposes of writing his biography he is actually investigating the disappearance of a woman who had been the old man's guest.

In its expose' of bourgeois double standards and numerous scenes of carefullybuilt suspense then the film emerges to be extremely typical of its director as well as being reasonably representative of his vast body of work.".

	schema:reviewBody "This Claude Chabrol film is notable for being the occasion of the film debut of 21 yearold Anne Brochet. She does an absolutely brilliant job but that was but a prelude to her magnificent performance in the later TOUS LES MATINS DU MONDE ALL THE MORNINGS OF THE WORLD 1991 where she was unforgettable as the daughter of SaintColombe the viola da gamba composer. The word brochet means 'pike' in English so that if she were English or American she would be Anne Pike. I cannot resist pointing out that my mother's best friend at school was named Annie Pike. A pike is a very large freshwater fish for those who are unacquainted with such matters. I wonder how Anne Brochet would get on with the British actress Rosamund Pike. They are opposite types but equally inspired. It seems to me that in an ideal world all pikes should swim together as friends but then a pike can be a ferocious fish which not only eats up all the small fish but will fight great battles against rival pikes. However back to the film. This film features a powerful tour de force performance by Philippe Noiret but I do feel that he went slightly over the top and that Chabrol might have held him back just a bit. Nevertheless as an egotistical and exhibitionist television game show presenter on French television the character was meant to be well over the top so maybe it was OK to emote with such force. The film is about a writer played excellently by Robin Renucci who specialises in bemused and quizzical looks who pretends to write a biography of Noiret whereas he is really interested in investigating the disappearance of his sister Nathalie as she had been living in Noiret's large house and then vanished suddenly. The story is very hackneyed in that something like it has been made into a film so many times especially in Britain and the basic tale goes back to the Victorian 'Uncle Silas'. Noiret is the guardian of pale innocent and waiflike Brochet her parents having died in a car crash when she was 5. Noiret may even have caused that. She is very rich or was before he systematically began stealing all her money. Soon she will 'come into her majority' i.e. be 21 so things are reaching a climax and he is feeding her poison slowly. She is thus the imprisoned victim who is being killed off by her ruthless guardian. Brochet had been close to Nathalie. Renucci and she become close and Renucci discovers what the dastardly Noiret is really up to and the struggle is on to save Brochet from being murdered and Renucci from being killed as well. Will evil win? Trust Claude Chabrol to know.".

	schema:reviewBody "The popular television presenter Christian Legagneur is a man loved by his millions of fans. He is famous for the prizes given in the program to older contestants who are rewarded with exotic trips to faraway places. As any celebrity worth his fame Legagneur is flattered when Roland Wolf decides to write his biography. The emcee proposes to do it in his country estate.Nothing prepares Roland for what he is about to find in the chteaulike setting. There are some other guests who seem to be part of Legagneur's coterie of friends. But Roland in reality is in pursuit of someone who disappeared a long time ago. Finding Catherine a mysterious young woman afflicted with a strange nervous disease at the estate poses a lot of questions Legagneur is not ready to answer.Masques directed by Claude Chabrol was shown recently on cable as a retrospective of his work.

He is famous for the prizes given in the program to older contestants who are rewarded with exotic trips to faraway places. As any celebrity worth his fame Legagneur is flattered when Roland Wolf decides to write his biography. The emcee proposes to do it in his country estate.Nothing prepares Roland for what he is about to find in the chteaulike setting. There are some other guests who seem to be part of Legagneur's coterie of friends. But Roland in reality is in pursuit of someone who disappeared a long time ago. Finding Catherine a mysterious young woman afflicted with a strange nervous disease at the estate poses a lot of questions Legagneur is not ready to answer.Masques directed by Claude Chabrol was shown recently on cable as a retrospective of his work.

One of the big deficits it creates is the silencing of Roland's sister Madeleine who since she's central to his risktaking devoted work and plotting is the motivating force of his investigation. In fact his pursuit of justice for her demonstrates real and pretty remarkable devotion and a love which should make her death pivotal to the film.So how is it that Chabrol's lengthy ending vanishes her? Shouldn't her presence in terms of justice done have taken center stage. What we get instead is a way over the top cynical confession and a featherweight romance which is not even in line with the film's own content.Why not end with Catherine bravely and independently testifying at Christian Legagnier's trial rather than all fluff in the arms of her friend's brother. Why can't she stand on her own on behalf of a murdered woman whose life she shared as an inmate in a bluebeard asylum which is run by the very man she can now finally destroy. Why can't her gagged life end in speech? Sisterhood is what the movie cries out for but what we get is sisterinlawhood with the mediator being the rather feckless brother who has nothing to offer but a nerdy smile and a Hollywood embrace and who played chess with her tyrant while her own life was nearly being snuffed out in a junkyardperhaps the same destruction that Madeleine experienced.An actual trial would also mean the victory of justice and reason over all the lustful and greedy emotion that the movie spirals into as we are taken from a bourgeois estate to a bluebeard dungeon. The actual ending is just more of the grotesquea grossly staged drama and a sugarcoated love both of which are totally unconvincing in terms of the movie's actual development. Catherine's victory is not for her at all although she does certainly deserve it but for the extension of her own dependency on males. In fact one must ask oneself in the end whether Roland Wolf and Christian Legagnier were but members of a joint enterprise for property control?

Agata and Manfredi is a young couple in Catania deeply in love and growing happier as time goes by. When Manfredi is shot and killed Agata emerges from her shock with a desire for vengeance. Once she identifies the murderer herself she methodically seduces him in order to exact a confession. Zanussi's film centers on a woman who like many Sicilians is inherently distrustful of a justice system that veers toward leniency and inaction. Almost philosophical in tone and rich in symbolism the film is universal with its idealistic romance and vows of forever while being simultaneously singular. Valeria Golino as Agata turns in a performance that conveys the hope and drive of a woman on a path towards tragedy.";

For the last 90 minutes we've watched him as he leads an unremarkable life around a remarkably evil secret there's a child in his basement for use as a lover and a son. But no one really knows Michael  perhaps not even Michael himself. This is challenging viewing. Schleinzer has the same objective eye as Michael Haneke with whom he worked on The White Ribbon and the same devious wit. He uses his simple images reflectively making the observer reconsider their own assumptions and prejudices. What's most disturbing about this film is not that it is walltowall creepy but how dreadfully normal everything seems. Outside the underground lair the activities of Michael and Wolfgang David Rauchenberger appear on the surface to be those of an only child and a grumpy parent. We're helpless observers in this quietly unfolding nightmare. Whether Michael is any more than an extended exercise in discomfort is debatable. It doesn't attempt to explore the psychology of its central character as a film like The Woodsman does. It certainly doesn't provide any possibility of redemption. But there's an inarguable truth in the humanisation of this monster and that's what makes this film valuable  even if it is the furthest thing from entertainment you'll ever see.".

Outside the underground lair the activities of Michael and Wolfgang David Rauchenberger appear on the surface to be those of an only child and a grumpy parent. We're helpless observers in this quietly unfolding nightmare. Whether Michael is any more than an extended exercise in discomfort is debatable. It doesn't attempt to explore the psychology of its central character as a film like The Woodsman does. It certainly doesn't provide any possibility of redemption. But there's an inarguable truth in the humanisation of this monster and that's what makes this film valuable  even if it is the furthest thing from entertainment you'll ever see.";

	schema:reviewBody "So this movie is about a pedophile who's keeping a child in his basement. It's such a terrifying setup that initially I decided against seeing it. Then I read some very positive media reviews which also mentioned there was nothing graphic and so I decided to give it a go. They also called it darkly humorous which I didn't see at all. When I first saw the kid's face I almost turned it off like I said this is an extremely disturbing premise. I actually kind of wish I did I had been expecting something different like a police scenario or some back story about him we don't get any history of Michael or Wolfgang. Once you see Wolfgang you just have to watch and hope he is going to end up better off. I couldn't turn off the movie with him in that situation yes I know it's not real but we also know things like this do happen in the real world.But rest assured there is no sexual contact between the man and the boy pictured in the movie not even hugs or embraces even though there's no doubt about what's going on. There is one scene where Michael takes out his penis but it's about six feet away from Wolfgang and it's not a sexual thing he's actually making a weird joke and it was shot in split screen so the young actor wasn't present for it. The only explicit violence is against Michael so you don't care and even then it's not graphic.Michael is not only a pedophile but as far as I can tell a sociopath. This is a different representation of a pedophile than Todd Solonz's Happiness where the pedophile does seem to have empathy and shame. Michael is absolutely without either of these emotions. There's also something very off about him you know besides being a sociopathic pedophile as shown in his social life and sense of humor.The movie is slow but not boring. It's very taut and the ending had me holding my breath to see what would happen. Some have said it's ambiguous I didn't think so but if you read the comments about the movie you'll get the director's view of what the ending was supposed to mean. I wanted more denouement but the comments also explain why the director chose to end the movie where he did. The acting is absolutely amazing. Michael Fuith is mesmerizing and brings out the banality of evil very skilfully. I usually do well with disturbing movies but this was a stretch for me. I avoid anything with graphic violence against children and this does indeed fit that criterion but it is about something so terrible that anyone who is not disturbed has something wrong with them in my opinion. That said I think people can still appreciate this movie as a wellwritten and wellacted one. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone with children I just can't imagine having a child and watching this movie.".

The lack of histrionics however does not mean that the film lacks drama. Certainly notin fact it does create  at times an almost unbearable tension.

Even then his incapacity for emotion towards the child or indeed for anybody else is striking which partly explains his appalling actions. I don't know how the details of this story reflect on the actual tale but it seems a believable portrait of how someone could come to act in this way. The film is low budget some of the scenes may be shot as they are to save filming them more expensively although the advantage is that the audience is encouraged to concentrate on what matters not some lush background.

This is a disturbing film but it is well crafted and presented. It deals with a ten year old boy Wolfgang played by David Rauchenburger held captive in the basement of Michael an insurance adjuster played by Michael Fuith. Michael clearly considers himself a caring guardian feeding the boy providing books and entertainments There is absolutely non of the more lurid aspects of child abuse depicted sexual or otherwise although it is strongly inferred. The movie presents a sterile emotionless relationship an off kilter version of playing house making believe the bolted door does not exist.Wolfgang is a clever young lad and knows what needs be done to survive his ordeal he bides his time. Michael's life away from Wolfgang consists of the day to day routines of going to work being social at the office and looking totally normal. The movie takes it's time. There are long cuts where the subjects are motionless. I had to check my system to see if it stalled out as it sometimes does on you tube movies. No it was shot with a casual regard for time or storytelling and yet it held my attention waiting for something to happen Life steps in The ending where we are to guess as to whether the boy lives or diesis suppose to be ambiguous but not in my book. An earnest and disturbing second film. I give it Eight out of ten Art House Stars. If you have a short attention span skip it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Michael is a 95minute film from Austria and as it was made in 2011 it has its 5th anniversary this year and of course it is in German language The writer and director is Markus Schleinzer who is known for working as a casting on more than a few prestigious projects such as Das weie Band. And this film we have here is his only effort as writer and director so far but honestly it really makes me and audiences hope that he will do more in the future as the man in charge behind the camera. It is the story of a man in his 30s who is a pedophile and locks a boy in his basement. But it is an entirely different work than Room for example. If you know a bit about Austrian film you may recognize lead actor Michael Fuith or other cast members and you will also know that the films this country produces usually have very dark humor but of course the subject here is not fitting at all for such an approach. It is a tragic movie not a tragicomic one. Everybody who you see in here or almost everybody gives us a reason to feel sorry for him most of all the title character who is a very sick and ill man and he is not doing what he does because of sadist reasons or anything but because he is a victim of his sexuality.There was a moment here and there when I felt the film dragged and honestly I did not find too many of the supporting characters really interesting but Schleinzer's vision and Fuith's performance make it very much worth checking out. This is a film that is bold and fearless for the most part and it is certainly quite a challenge to make a movie on a subject like this and still succeed in a way that I can describe it as I just did. I also felt that the run time of slightly over 90 minutes was fairly perfect not too long not too short and the makers definitely succeeded with the story they wanted to tell us. It was a very authentic watch and it almost felt like a documentary at times even if we find out about the darkest secrets of course. I give Michael a thumbsup and this film is for sure another example of how strong Austrian cinema is right now actually has been for a long time. Go see it if you can deal with the difficult subject of the plot here. A rewarding watch for sure.".

	schema:headline " Brilliant and heartbreaking";
	schema:reviewBody "There are perhaps two movies a year that keep me from breathing or blinking for and hour and a half and I just found one of them.'Michael' by Markus Schleinzer is a masterpiece and a testament to how the greatest of evil can hide in broad daylight.Michael is smart and articulate. He is neat and clean. He irons his own shirts and maintains a house more sterile than a hospital. And he kidnaps young boys and locks them in his basement.There are no graphic scenes of his sexual attacks on 10year old Wolfgang the poor little boy held prisoner in a soundproof basement room thank God but the subtlety of how they are presented doesn't reduce the horror of it.Of course we already know Michael is evil the first scene of him carefully washing his precious penis in the bathroom sink after leaving Wolfgang's room filled me with rage.In another Michael reclines on Wolfgang's tiny bed and begins to lightly fondle himself and then quietly commands the boy who is already visibly cowering in the corner to 'come over'.

At this point his family has no idea of what a sicko he truly was. As far as they're concerned Michael was an honorable and disciplined fellow of uncorrupted character and fine moral aptitude.

Does he have food? Is he starving to death? Is he screaming at the top of his lungs in desperation? The film purposely refuses to let us know.This produced a level of suspense that I found almost too horrible to bear. My mind wanted to snap.

	onyx:emotionText "There are perhaps two movies a year that keep me from breathing or blinking for and hour and a half and I just found one of them.'Michael' by Markus Schleinzer is a masterpiece and a testament to how the greatest of evil can hide in broad daylight.Michael is smart and articulate. He is neat and clean. He irons his own shirts and maintains a house more sterile than a hospital. And he kidnaps young boys and locks them in his basement.There are no graphic scenes of his sexual attacks on 10year old Wolfgang the poor little boy held prisoner in a soundproof basement room thank God but the subtlety of how they are presented doesn't reduce the horror of it.Of course we already know Michael is evil the first scene of him carefully washing his precious penis in the bathroom sink after leaving Wolfgang's room filled me with rage.In another Michael reclines on Wolfgang's tiny bed and begins to lightly fondle himself and then quietly commands the boy who is already visibly cowering in the corner to 'come over'.

First the pacing is painfully slow with long stares by the characters which reveal little at best. Second the boy who is kept locked up for hours or days at a time often in the dark looks far healthier and well groomed than i would have expected. Third there is no attempt to show how he managed to kidnap the boy other than showing a failed attempt at getting a playmate I assume for both of them. I didn't know that the director was associated with Michael Haneke an arthouse and critics favorite but having seen Funny Games I can see why such a film as this might be made. That film was repellent but at least in place of seeing the desired revenge Haneke played a trick on the audience to intentionally deprive them of catharsis or satisfaction. This one does the same but without any ploy. And don't be fooled into thinking we really learn much about what causes pedophilia. The film may look intellectual but it only scratches the surface. It avoids cheap titillation but replaces it with boredom and superficiality. Beware of the many positive reviews as I am confident mainstream audiences will be totally turned off.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having just seen the film 'Michael' what so say? For one it is clear one has to try and see it from a purely objective point of view and try to forget that this film reinstates stupid medieval superstitions about human child eating monsters and calls upon our most basic instincts the instincts created by media that has us believe that dark lonely beings are the most immediate threat to our children  and not the parents that regularly kill about 300 times as much as any external criminals or indeed simple cash crashes that kill about 500 times as many per year. Watching this film felt like being taken for as exploitative ride about the death of children in car crashes. It was like watching a films about how smelly black people are shown to a Mississippi white audience in the 1930's or showing a film about the evil of Jews to a group of neoNazis. Superficial false and totally stereotypical. However forgetting about this aspects and being objective what was the film like? It is well made has artistic homogeneity and has consistent mood creation. It also has good acting. Otherwise trying to be objective still the film was stupid pointless exploitative highly pretentious and predictable. I also founds it shameful but that is a personal idea. We are a long long way from any masterpiece which being entered in competition in the Cannes festival supposes. A quick look shows up that the director is a friend of Michael Heneke the 'enfant chri' of the Cannes film festival if there ever was one. The film is completely stupid... though I'm not sure I can explain that one so clearly. Like a stupid person it goes nowhere does nothing and worst of all thinks it is intelligent. Every human emotion in the film is another reason for censorship in this film which consistently cuts before anything gets too explained or too 'deep' as though it were 'cool' or profound to do so. This I imagine for the director would be called 'style' in actual fact it is just plain stupid. It is utterly pointless because despite its desperate attempt to seem 'deep' about something it says nothing at all or about individuals about society or anything else for that matter other than the closed mind of an unlikely psychopath who tortures children and kills cats. And it doesn't even make the effort to try and explain the psychopath! Some watching the film may feel there is something going on beyond their understanding. There isn't. It is little more than an ego trip taken by the director down an emotionally exploitative route having not found a better way to grasp people's attention than usual the most crass and cheap means a perverted pedophile mentally and physically torturing his defenseless child victim over 90 minutes. It doesn't matter how much you cover the cheap and easy theme with pseudo 'style' it remains as exploitative of our basic instincts as making a film about 20 different ways of slowly ripping the wings off a butterfly. The pretentiousness is above every else not to be believed. It can only be understood maybe by the fact this is the director's first film. It is a cold and distant style we have seen from German cinema for decades now and much better done than him. No it is not 'cool' anymore to take such emotional distance from everything it is stupid and a waste of a film. The experiment is over try something new. Maybe I watch too many films but from the very start I heard myself saying 'please don't let him use the grotesque image of him spending a lonely sad Christmas with the boy'. And ...he did! No worse he had then singing carols! Please don't let this become a 'vengeance' story and it did! it was simply a basic story of how the boy took revenge on the evil man in the end. Well that and about 10 other predictable events. From about half way through I knew he would finish the film JUST as his crimes are discovered and leave us dangling. I just didn't know if he would be alive at that time or if he died in a car crash. That ending the director might call 'mysterious' or something deep the audience should think about for weeks after seeing the film when in actual fact it is simply ...stupid. But this film fits in well into such festivals. It is well made. That is enough to put any friends of yours in the biggest festival in the world. There are PLENTY I mean plenty of much worse films than this one that take an incomprehensible precedence over others. That's how fickle the market is.".

A service which takes your calls handles all potentially tense situations of private eyes and that suspecting spouse essentially taking care of you on the side while you bang. Sounds good? I think so too at least in a business sense.Ray Elliot Steve Coogan runs such a service. It's a money spinner based on statistics that one in 4 men stray and one in 10 women cheat. He advertises his risk management career through word of mouth and takes pride in his job in bailing clients out of seemingly explosive marital situations. The prerequisites? A calm cool mind that can spin out stories and tell them with a straight face.Lola Davis the hot Rebecca Romijn is his new management recruit and without much orientation plunges into the job head on. Initially you might think the movie will develop on the above company politics scenario and have the two leads get involved with each other romantically. But no before you can get to see the next fling the movie heads on to classic crime noir territory.On his last field job Ray's client accidentally kills his mistress in a bout of SM and it's up to Ray to clear the mess up violating one of his principles that his company doesn't provide alibis for crime. However his reputation and integrity is on the line and he has no choice but to cover it all up.And you'll probably wince at the amount of challenges Ray goes through in having this done and having a price put out on his head. It's essentially one heck of a caper as we witness how Ray Elliot schemes and plot to get his rear out of situations that's seemingly impossible and incredibly lucky to get out of. It's full of crossings and doublecrossings and while you might be lost at certain plot points just hang in there as all will converge for the finale leaving you with a smirk quite satisfied with the outcome.What's fun in this movie is the huge ensemble cast that play the many characters on screen. Another XMen franchise regular James Marsden Cyclops is here as the inept himbo Wendell Hatch Ray Elliot's last client and we have a myriad of characters like hit men gangsters cops an unsatisfied wife etc from a cast of Selma Blair James Brolin Sam Elliot Jaime King John Leguizamo Deborah Kara Unger and the likes.One thing's for sure having a huge network of those whom you have deposited emotional or material help with certainly will help bucketloads when the time comes. If you're up for a caper then I'd recommend The Alibi for its fun.".

Yeah you have to pay attention to what's going on which is usually the sign of a good film. James marsden was hysterical hope to see him doing more comedy.

Director duo Matt Checkowski and Kurt Mattila do a decent job but at times the pace really slows down and then suddenly picks up at a drastic level where it even reaches a point that the leaves the viewer confused concerning certain plot points. But just bear with it as there is some good writing the main plot is unusual and has a neonoir feel to it and in the end it feels entertaining. The huge impressive ensemble cast that comprises of an unusual combination of actors is fun to watch. Steve Coogan at times looks uncomfortable in his part but does an adequate job overall. Rebecca Romijn is smoking hot and easily pulls off the smart babe. Selma Blair pulls off the cute seductress. James Brolin Sam Elliot and James Marsden are fun to watch. Deborah Kara Unger and John Leguizamo make their presence felt in briefer roles. Perhaps some of the characters could have used more development which would have given the actors more scope to bring them out. The humour is very situational and a few of the comedy are dry and just fail to trigger laughter. The film itself is very short. The makers wanted to give it a 60's feel but at the same time apply that to todays world and I think it fell somewhere in between. As I said earlier 'The Alibi' could have done with more slickness and style used more character development and more comedy but overall it isn't a bad film and can be quite enjoyable on a windy day.".

The humour is very situational and a few of the comedy are dry and just fail to trigger laughter. The film itself is very short. The makers wanted to give it a 60's feel but at the same time apply that to todays world and I think it fell somewhere in between. As I said earlier 'The Alibi' could have done with more slickness and style used more character development and more comedy but overall it isn't a bad film and can be quite enjoyable on a windy day.";

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is like a gigantic tangle of string. I mean gigantic like the size of a big house with a two car garage on the end of a cul de sac. At first glance the loops and twists and turns are impressive but it's really nothing more than one long boring strand. The sheer size of it can be overwhelming but when you think about somebody spending so much time just tangling string you're overwhelmed by such a wretched waste. As the string tangler should have stopped after a couple of hours and found something better to do these filmmakers needed to stop piling one plot contrivance on another and make a single one of them work well.Let's see how far you can get into the plot of Lies and Alibis before you want to say Enough! and go watch an episode of Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers. Ray Elliot Steve Coogan is a former con man who's found an unusual way to go straight. He runs a security firm for adulterers. When people want to cheat on their spouse they hire Ray's company to cover up for them and provide them with airtight alibis. While in the midst of hiring the statuesque Lola Rebecca Romijn as a new associate Ray is recognized by a thug Henry Rollins who mentions that there's a 5 million dollar contract out on Ray's old scam artist partner. Ray is then called away to deal with a client emergency and after helping the wealthy and horny Robert Hatch James Brolin conceal yet another affair from his wife Ray is hired to help Hatch's son do the same. So while Wendell Hatch James Marsden spends the weekend at a bed and breakfast with his girlfriend Ray pretends to be Wendell at a broker's convention to fool his wife.Are you still with me? Well Wendell accidentally kills his girlfriend and cajoles Ray into covering that up which he does by calling on the thug who recognized him. That thug works for a Mormon hitman Sam Elliot who then decides that Ray absolutely must help him with alibis for his murderous work which Ray seemingly consents to while dodging the amorous advances of one of the Mormon's wives Selma Blair. Then Ray discovers that Robert Hatch is looking to kill him to permanently cover up for his son's deadly mistake while the police have already traced the missing girl back to Ray who also finds himself the target of Hatch's driver John Lequizamo the enraged boyfriend of Wendell's now dead girlfriend. There's also a cold blooded assassin coming after the 5 million dollar contract on Ray's old partner and a bit of confusion as to whether Ray knows where his old partner is whether he's alive or dead or even if Ray is himself his old partner. Compounding that confusion is Ray's quest to find a corpse.And of course Ray and Lola make googoo eyes at each other even though she makes him look like a member of the Lollipop Guild as Ray schemes to lure everyone involved in this whole snarl to a hotel where they can all get their just desserts.I don't know about you but by the time it got to the Mormon assassin I had had just about enough of this movie. It was all too much to believe especially when Ray is always portrayed as so slick and in control that there never seems to be even the slightest bit of danger in any of it. When you wade through it all you're left with the reality that Ray is a long boring strand. He's not interesting and he's certainly not sympathetic. So this convoluted tale boils down to there never being any real risk for the main character and the viewer not caring even if there was.Lies and Alibis might have found some way to work if it had focused on Ray and Lola Ray's unusual business and one other thing. Maybe the problems posed by the Hatch's maybe the people gunning for Ray's old partner maybe the Mormon assassin who wants Ray to cover up his killings. Glopping them all and more into the mix doesn't work.Unless a housesized tangle of string sounds to you like a great idea for a tourist attraction don't bother with this film.".

Elliot runs a risk management firm on the face of it. In reality it is probably based on the reallife Alibi Network  like the real thing Elliot's company helps wayward husbands cheat by giving them alibis intercepting calls to the hotel where they're supposed to be staying etc.There are several subplots going on but the main one is that Ray helps out a client's Brolin son Wendell Marsden by allowing him to cheat on his fianc. Wendell is supposed to be at a conference in San Francisco instead with faked identity showing he is Ray Elliot he's living in up in Santa Barbara with a hot woman. Ray as Wendall is in San Francisco. Unfortunately Wendell's girl is into kinky sex and during one session winds up dead. The cops want to speak to Ray.I found this a funny clever film with the beautiful Romijn playing a new and valuable assistant of Ray's Sam Elliot as a hit man with several wives who is after Ray's old partner and James Brolin as a cheating husband. Leguizamo is a riot as the dead woman's boyfriend.Lots of twists. This makes a good rental.".

The cops want to speak to Ray.I found this a funny clever film with the beautiful Romijn playing a new and valuable assistant of Ray's Sam Elliot as a hit man with several wives who is after Ray's old partner and James Brolin as a cheating husband. Leguizamo is a riot as the dead woman's boyfriend.Lots of twists. This makes a good rental.";

	schema:reviewBody "A fun movie with several strange twists. Essentially Ray Elliott Steve Coogan owns a small company which helps people set up alibis in order to continue extramarital affairs. For example if a person who is having an affair is supposed to be in a business meeting then all calls will be rerouted to one of Ray Elliotts assistants who will field the call and cover for the client. Naturally this is all done for a hefty price. Unfortunately things go wrong when a new client accidentally kills his mistress. Not only is Ray Elliott left to try to clean up the mess but he soon finds that he has a contract out on his head as well. Likewise his former partner also has a contract out on his head and people are swarming all over the place looking for him too. At any rate Steve Coogan performed in an outstanding manner. Likewise Rebecca Romijn looked awesome as Ray Elliott's new employee Lola. And while this film has some mature themes it really doesn't go overboard or push the envelope. In short this is a good comedy which most people will probably get a kick out of.".

	schema:reviewBody "Before I begin let me say this I like Jim Carrey. I really do. In fact I watched Ace Ventura Pet Detective back when I was a kid and I still find it funny today. But as with most actors and comedians there is that little thing called shtick. Don't we all see a pattern when we see those familiar faces on the screen? In fact it seems to generate the same kind of reaction We become endeared to it at first but then it gets real by the time the fourth or fifth movie rolls around. Will Ferrel Adam Sandler and even Carey himself are all the biggest 'offenders' so to speak in this day and age. But for the sake of this interview let's focus on the latter and how this movie relates to his 'shtick.' The movie in question if it wasn't obvious already is Carey's latest venture Mr. Popper's Penguins. Based looselythe key word being 'loosely'on the 1938 novel by Richard and Florence Atwater Penguins tells the story of a workobsessed businessman named Tom Popper whose life is turned upside down when he inherits six penguins from his late explorer father. As is wont his cold heart begins to melt by means of the flightless coldloving birds. In the meanwhile he tries to evade suspicions of his bosses a respected entrepreneur and a brownnosing zoo keeper while also rekindling his relationship with his estranged exwife and kids. And yes that's the plot in a nutshell. But does that mean it's as mindnumbing as it sounds? No my friends. It's not as bad as it seems.First off let's get the downside out of the way. The plot is thoroughly and shamelessly predictable. It is riddled with so many clichs that I could sit there predict every turn the movie was going to take and be right. Also I sat there and counted sixyes sixpoop or fart jokes. There may have been a couple that I missed during a bathroom break but I'm sure there were a couple more that I could have counted. I blush to admit it but I do laugh at potty humor but only when I don't expect it or it makes the movie actually funny. Again predictability killed the mood for me.However for all its faults it's more charming than repulsive. Carrey though he is relying on his standard over the top shtick is not overshadowing those adorable penguins. But aside from Carrey his six costars and his estranged family there are two saving graces for this movie. Mr. Popper's secretary Pippi played by British actress Ophelia Lovibond is a prim little poppet with a penchant for alliterating all her sentences with any and every word beginning with the letter P. She does grate a little bit but she is still quite adorable. The other actress to show her face here is the great Angela Lansbury who plays the owner of a restaurant that Popper used to eat at with his late father. It is so refreshing to see this woman on the silver screen again especially for a girl who grew up with the likes of Beauty and the Beast and Bedknobs and Broomsticks There's alliteration there too eh? Oh darn this movie!. She still retains that grace and charm through all the forced dialogue and situations and I applaud her for that.Overall my feelings for this movie can best be summed up by its summary on RottenTomatoes.com Bland inoffensive and thoroughly predictable Mr. Popper's Penguins could have been worsebut it should have been better. But for all its faults its charming fun and completely harmless. It's probably best for kids but animal lovers will love the cuddly penguins and Carrey fans will like seeing their idol on screen. Give it a shot and decide for yourselves.".

But for the sake of this interview let's focus on the latter and how this movie relates to his 'shtick.' The movie in question if it wasn't obvious already is Carey's latest venture Mr. Popper's Penguins. Based looselythe key word being 'loosely'on the 1938 novel by Richard and Florence Atwater Penguins tells the story of a workobsessed businessman named Tom Popper whose life is turned upside down when he inherits six penguins from his late explorer father. As is wont his cold heart begins to melt by means of the flightless coldloving birds. In the meanwhile he tries to evade suspicions of his bosses a respected entrepreneur and a brownnosing zoo keeper while also rekindling his relationship with his estranged exwife and kids. And yes that's the plot in a nutshell. But does that mean it's as mindnumbing as it sounds? No my friends. It's not as bad as it seems.First off let's get the downside out of the way. The plot is thoroughly and shamelessly predictable. It is riddled with so many clichs that I could sit there predict every turn the movie was going to take and be right. Also I sat there and counted sixyes sixpoop or fart jokes. There may have been a couple that I missed during a bathroom break but I'm sure there were a couple more that I could have counted. I blush to admit it but I do laugh at potty humor but only when I don't expect it or it makes the movie actually funny. Again predictability killed the mood for me.However for all its faults it's more charming than repulsive. Carrey though he is relying on his standard over the top shtick is not overshadowing those adorable penguins. But aside from Carrey his six costars and his estranged family there are two saving graces for this movie. Mr. Popper's secretary Pippi played by British actress Ophelia Lovibond is a prim little poppet with a penchant for alliterating all her sentences with any and every word beginning with the letter P. She does grate a little bit but she is still quite adorable. The other actress to show her face here is the great Angela Lansbury who plays the owner of a restaurant that Popper used to eat at with his late father. It is so refreshing to see this woman on the silver screen again especially for a girl who grew up with the likes of Beauty and the Beast and Bedknobs and Broomsticks There's alliteration there too eh? Oh darn this movie!. She still retains that grace and charm through all the forced dialogue and situations and I applaud her for that.Overall my feelings for this movie can best be summed up by its summary on RottenTomatoes.com Bland inoffensive and thoroughly predictable Mr. Popper's Penguins could have been worsebut it should have been better. But for all its faults its charming fun and completely harmless. It's probably best for kids but animal lovers will love the cuddly penguins and Carrey fans will like seeing their idol on screen. Give it a shot and decide for yourselves.";

The movie formula requires that the boy grow up to neglect his own kids and sure enough the formula is followed.

Kids that age do not need to be challenged by a movie just entertained.So this movie entertains. Your kids will laugh  my kids did and I laughed and my wife laughed. There were no concerns with offcolor material.

However It certainly has many flaws it throws far too much conflict and issues at Mr. Popper a divorce a difficult job and kids who hate him they seemed like too much problems to give its audience for a ninety minute film and adding the penguins didn't feel as significant because of the real life struggles that faced him. I found Ophelia Lovibond's performance unbearable Pippi was a very annoying character her constant use of words beginning with p wasn't funny to begin with and they just kept it coming. It has its flaws but Mr. Popper's Penguins is still a fun film that I would recommend to a family if you ever see it on television and have some time to kill. Mr Popper gets sent six penguins which makes the man's life a lot more difficult although he starts to grow fond of them when he discovers the joy it brings his children.".

	schema:headline " Jim Carrey saves this film from being a total disaster";
	schema:reviewBody "On Saturday I had the honor of attending an advanced screening of Mr. Popper's Penguins. Now I have never read the book in my life but I am aware that the film is an extremely loose contemporary adaptation with a setting in the present day rather than the 1930s in the book. So if you're a diehard fan of the classic book avoid this movie because they made so many changes to this new setting it's insane. I am a Jim Carrey fan as well which was the main reason I went to this film but don't kill me for saying that I still have not seen Liar Liar Ace Ventura and The Mask yet. But those three are still on my watch list though.Jim Carrey plays Tom Popper a successful New York City businessman who has put almost all of his life into his work life instead of family. One day he gets a phone call saying that his father has died but he left him a gift behind. That gift is six gentoo penguins and these penguins are going to help him realize that he has shunned out almost every opportunity he's had in life to appreciate the beauty you can experience if you take the time to do so. Once the penguins are brought into the public eye though Popper has to contend with a stern zoo keeper Clark Gregg who wants the penguins because he believes that Popper's house is not wellsuited to take care of all of them.Jim Carrey definitely carries this movie and saves it from being a complete disaster. His physical slapstick that has become well known in almost his whole career translates in a good enough manner to provide so decent moments of comedy. He may be very grounded in his limits for what he can and can't do but watching Carrey go crazy on screen is always good enough for me. The supporting cast's performances are really nothing special but it was pretty cool to see Clark Gregg go on the villain side for once when he's not playing SHIELD Agent Phil Coulson in the MARVEL films building up to The Avengers. However the penguins I believe are the weakest part of the film. The jokes involving the penguins are heavily centered on young children and parents who like to see their kids laugh. I'm 17 so I thought most of the jokes were very juvenile at some times especially a running joke they carry on with one of the penguins who goes by the name of Stinky. In addition you'll be able to tell in every scene involving the penguins when they're real or CGI especially in the final climactic sequence of the film.Overall if you've seen the trailers to this film you pretty much know what you're going to get out it. This movie could have been a Razzie nominee in several categories but Jim Carrey is there to save it from going in that direction. I can say that I mildly enjoyed most of this movie but I'll probably forget sometime this week.".

Instead however what we're left with is an insulting homage to all things kitsch and puerile that repeats the same jokes over and over ad nauseam to the point of sheer boredom.The plot is simple Mr. Popper is a wealthy business man who has all the riches in the world but lacks the one currency that sells movies love. Struggling to father his children in the same way that his father provided little support for him Mr. Popper ends up inheriting a box of penguins from his recently deceased dad as a means of somehow connecting and finding the love that he lost through his shortsighting endeavours. What follows of course is exactly what you might expect from that brief synopsis and maybe a quick look at a minute of the trailer. At first driving Popper up the wall the penguins who each have their own delightful trait we have Captain Loudy Bitey Stinky Lovey and Nimrod soon warm up to their coldhearted owner and vice versa as everyone involved learns that big fancy houses and a six figure income only matter as long as you're having fun and loving everything and wearing sweaters and giving high fives and being as routinely sickly as humanely possible without starring in an advertisement for the Nintendo Wii. Oh and there are poop and fart jokes and penguins running into things plenty of them.As much of a stinker that the script is however there was a time when one could rely on Jim Carrey and his assorted hijinks to bounce off stage and interrupt everyone's heavy eyelid batting and make us laugh but even Carrey who is clearly showing his age here in this glossy advertisement for The American Dream fails to make much of an impression. There are a couple of moments here and there where Mr. Popper can be amusing but for the most part he's like a bland dislikeable caricature of Donald Trump. I mean this is the same guy who made a lawyer the funniest person the screen during the summer of 1997 surely a salesman shouldn't be a problem? But it is a real big one. And as it comes to its long overdrawn erratic conclusion you get the impression that Carrey's comedic career is one destined to drown in a sea of similar safeplay Eddie Murphyesque family comedies that leave adults snoring and kids running up and down the aisles. As Pippi Peponopolis might say it's positively petulant pandering and painful Mr. Popper! So please please stop pretending like love is the answer when clearly money is all that was on the minds of everyone involved herethat's you're problem and how you fix itobviouslyis to give everyone at 20th Century Fox a penguin. Yabsolutely!".

	schema:reviewBody "Loosely based on the 1938 novel of the same name by Richard and Florence Atwater this is a family movie that does not ask to be taken seriously.As a kid Popper never really knew his father an explorer who was always away on some adventure or another. As an adult he is a successful New York realtor but divorced and lives away from his two kids. Mr. Popper's Jim Carrey latest assignment is to acquire a landmark restaurant owned by entrepreneur Selma Van Gundy Angela Lansbury. Despite Popper's gift of the gab Van Gundy will not sell the Tavern on the Green unless the buyer is a person of true value. After a not so convincing attempt at buying the tavern Popper receives a strange inheritance from his late father half a dozen penguins. At first Popper is annoyed and irritated with these frosty creatures but they start to grow on him. His children then fall in love with the penguins and soon enough he starts to date his exwife Carla Gugino again. Soon enough Popper converts his plush New York condo into a winter wonderland to accommodate his winged friends much to the dismay of his neighbors and a pesky animal protection zoologist. Eventually Popper is on the verge of getting his family back but his bosses fire him for ignoring his job. Popper must now decide between being a lovable family man or revert back to being a cold business man that he was.Adults will find this movie filled with predictable moments some of which are clich ridden. Still there is a lot of charm and feelgood moments if viewed as a family movie. Kids will find the penguins adorable funny and mischievous all at the same time. Having said that there are few recurring jokes for adults as well only thing is they are more potty than witty. Jim Carrey fans will find his rubberface moments dwindled down to barely a handful of scenes. Although Carrey still has it in him it is evidently clear that his onscreen magic has diminished over the years since Ace Ventura Pet Detective. As a woman caught between dating her exhusband and a new prospect Gugino's scenes are subtle but do not really add as much in terms of comic moments. There is however a bit of feisty raunchiness in her eyes and if this was manifested into deeds it would have really added an extra depth to the movie. As a guest appearance I was delighted to see Ms Lansbury in this movie. Most noted as a TV icon in Murder She Wrote Lansbury's addition to the casting is well placed in a role as the regale New York entrepreneur. They could have added anyone from Glenn Close to Meryl Streep but Lansbury is perfectly cast and commands respect in the very few scenes she appears in. Another standout appearance comes from the lovely Ophelia Lovibond as Popper's personal assistant Ms Peppy. If you think the title of the movie is a bit of a tongue twister wait till you hear Peppy a person with precise paranoia in punctuating phrases with ample amounts of Ps. Pretty perky! With just ten titles to his credit this is a decent effort from director Mark Waters. Although a far cry from Happy Feet Waters' depiction of six cute penguins albeit CGI assisted adds amusement and heart felt warmth to scenes of icy New York. As a result this is a pleasant movie for families with young kids and is a preferred alternative to a trip to the zoo.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jim Carrey's career has in many ways mirrored that of Eddie Murphy. In their early days both had distinctive styles of their own  Murphy was fasttalking foulmouthed vulgar and very funny Carrey was a manic and energetic physical comedian like one of the Three Stooges on steroids. They were both at their best in those early years. Their comedy was effective and the films they made were usually enjoyable and funny. Then for reasons best known to themselves both men settled for a niche in that most insipid and cloying of genres  the mainstream Hollywood family comedy. From time to time both men escape from the constraints of this selfimposed exile  check out Murphy in Bowfinger for example or Carrey in The Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind  and we get a wonderful reminder of what they're capable of. But all too often both men slip back into Hollywood Family Comedy Hell where their talents are wasted on cinematic silliness like Mr Popper's Penguins. This Jim Carrey vehicle is lame and predictable for its duration pandering solely for children below the age of 10.Tom Popper Jim Carrey is a successful businessman who treats everyone around him with frosty disregard. As a child he was neglected by his father who spent most of his time gallivanting around the world in search of animals. As an adult Popper now treats his own kids  daughter Janie Madeline Carroll and son Billy Maxwell Perry Cotton  with the same dismissive indifference. One day he receives word that his father has died in some Godforsaken corner of the world and shortly afterwards Popper inherits a number of penguins. Initially he wants to be rid of them but soon he discovers that he actually cares for the penguins loves them even and before long he finds himself becoming a better person thanks to the effect the penguins have on his life. His relationship with his kids grows and he even starts to rekindle a romance with his exwife Amanda Carla Gugino. But as always things don't run smoothly and Popper ends up having to save his penguins from a nasty zookeeper while keeping alive a precious business deal with cranky old heiress Mrs Van Gundy Angela Lansbury. This isn't hugely different from Carrey's earlier offering Liar Liar. Once again a singleminded and neglectful father gets a shot at saving his marriage and rebuilding his relationship with his kids thanks to extraordinary circumstances. But where that film had a degree of manic energy this one merely offers sentimental schmaltz. Mr. Popper's Penguins is not a total loss by any means with some amusing moments and good special effects. It's just that the film doesn't really hang together as a whole alternating too often between the disappointingly predictable and the excessively juvenile. In fact the penguins have all the best moments  if it wasn't for them this would be a very long 94 minutes indeed.".

Problem is Ace has been rusting for some time and Carrey's act not only has become fatigued but lost a lot of energy along the way and when combined with the film's lazy punchless generic script it is left up to the CGI penguins to slip slide and crap their way into your heart and save the film. This clearly has to be the case since the clich family aspects touchingly accented by one of the most obnoxious film scores of saccharine sweet drivel in ages so bad no one is credited to take the blame to season the family melancholia and heart tugging sentimentality is so bland and predictable you soon grow weary of the human camera hogging. It's penguin exploitation they are the rage these days at its best and children's comedy at its most flaccid and unimaginative. Mr. Popper is a highly effective real estate developer who has a knack at closing the deal. He wants on the company shingle but he has to seal a deal with Miss Van Gundy Angela Lansbury to buy Tavern on the Green to become full partner. Divorced and not much of a dad he turns things around when his recently deceased absentee dad sends him a penguin followed by five more. It completely cramps his OCD style but when he sees they are enabling him to make strides with his kids and ex he turns his high rise into a winter wonderland to make the penguins more comfortable. Using the same strategy as Gus Visser and his Duck 25 with the penguins acting as linchpins and draw to the film they are much of the time relegated to supporting duty in favor of the tired family dynamic. Adorable as penguins are their thespian skills remain atrocious when compared to the abilities of say Alvin and Theodore. There are some fun moments provided by the flightless fowl when given an ideal stage with the water slide architecture of the Guggenhiem Museum and Carrey does display a couple of brief flashes that made him the funniest man in film back in the 90s and perhaps because of it his heart to hearts with family members fail to resonate. Bopper angst auteur Mark Waters Mean Girls Freaky Friday directs with a lackadaisical style that fails to attain little if any of the zany pitch one would expect when pairing Carrey and penguins. But Waters does more slipping and sliding than the penguins and Jim's time has come to be put on an ice flow. Popper's problem is too much people too little penguin.".

So a scathing review from me should really tell you how bad this film is. Let me start by comparing this to the book. Now I don't demand complete faithfulness but changes made should at least make sense in adapting a book to the screen. This film is almost as if the writers decided to do the exact opposite of everything in the book. In the book Mr Popper is poor happily married wants a penguin gets more penguins to stop it being lonely. In the film he is rich divorced wants nothing to do with the penguin gets more penguins by accident. It leaves us with some tripe that has been done over and over again. Businessman puts business over family has an inconvenience come into his life learns the value of family the end. Please look at The Santa Clause for how to do this. Characters seemed real despite the fantasy elements. Mr Popper's Penguins goes for the most contrived story points imaginable. It's pretty lazy writing to the point where having Carrey name the penguins was probably an example of the best names these writers could come up with. The film also makes everybody so painfully nice and then struggles to find a villain. Clark Gregg plays a zoo keeper that is entirely in the right. Yet the film hides him in shadowy cars and gives him ominous music. He should have been the hero of this movie. Krumholtz plays a neighbour whose life is made a living hell with all the noises. Even though it is against the rules to have penguins in the apartments he is once again played as the villain when he tries to get rid of the penguins. This is a world where levelheadedness is a sign of evil. Further emphasised by dumb ass Gugino. She's the exwife that will gladly leave a date for a man that failed at a 15 year marriage and then thinks that buying pet penguins is a good idea for her kids. It is also a very unfunny film. I can't even remember any jokes or at least any punchlines. Lots of poo and fart jokes though. This is a film that I would never want a child to see. It gives the impression that parents will just get back together that your own selfish happiness is above that of other living creatures that breaking the rules is fine if it's done in a cute way and so on. Please parents do your kids a huge favor and buy the book. Sit down and read it with them. It will be cheaper and will actually take less time than sitting through this movie.".

The fact that this movie was snubbed for the Academy Award for Best Picture is arguably the greatest disgrace in film history. Jim Carrey stars as Mr. Popper an uptight businessman who becomes lighthearted with the help of his pet penguins. Carrey clearly deserved the Academy Award for Best Actor in this movie. He brilliantly delivers the spectacularly written poop jokes in this movie to the point where I nearly died from laughter. The penguins namely Captain Nimrod Stinky Lovey Loudy and Bitey deliver incredible performances Nimrod clearly deserved an Academy Award for his inspiring performance as a mentally handicapped penguin. Don't listen to any of the foolish reviews of this movie it is an incredible comedydrama that focuses how the human condition can be helped by penguins. 10 out of 10.".

Well I'm not a Special Effects specialist so I found them ASTOUNDINGLY GOOD!!During my time in the business I spent so many hours designing sets and clothes and being there watching the filming of a scene endless times until I thought I was loosing my mind that I can appreciate ANY effort made by a crew trying to come up with something good making it impossible for me to put down other people's efforts. I loved the penguins the way they looked the way they acted and interacted with all the actors involved in their scenes... I found ALL THE ACTORS excellent in their roles otherwise they wouldn't be there believe me  from the humblest ones to Jim Carrey.I have no complains about the plot the happenings the incredibility of most of the scenes... I just enjoyed this movie as much as I never imagined I could have enjoyed it. It leaves you with a nice clean feeling about life and people.

Gone are the days when a Jim Carrey vehicle would come with something raunchy or naughty  remember how he burst onto the scene with Ace Ventura Pet Detective  and with each passing comedy of Carrey's now it becomes tamer until we finally hit the G rating in Mr Popper's Penguins a straight up family friendly comedy with feel good themes that you'll not be too far off if you thought this was a product of Disney with something shrewd because one cannot go wrong with animals coloured black and white from Pandas to Penguins.Jim Carrey plays the titular Mr Popper whom we follow through his fatherless childhood in the first few scenes given that his dad is an adventurer who travelled the world and never quite found it in him to return for important occasions. This translates to the present day grown up Potter who while is successful at his real estate job is a complete dud when it comes to the family arena having separated from his wife Amanda Carla Gugino and being again the disconnected dad to his kids Janie Madeline Carroll and Billy Maxwell Perry Cotton. Help comes indirectly in the form of a bequeathed package courtesy of Popper's dad who in his last will and testament left behind a live penguin to his son and through an expected communication mixup lands up with six of the Antarctic creatures.Carrey goes full circle in starring with CG animals as costars again although now visibly aged has had his thunder stolen by the very adorable penguins that comes with a distinct personality each in order to differentiate them amongst one another. Funny face Carrey has lost his rubbery potential and much of the mirth came from a select group of penguins just primed for comedy such as the one nicknamed Nimrod. Situations get crafted involving the penguins and Popper's kids that they are a given to show just how much the family members bond together when they play together which becomes the primary message and theme amongst others in the film.It was nice seeing Angela Lansbury in a support role as an elderly owner of a fine dining cafe within Central Park that becomes Popper's mission to get rid of if he wants to get into the board of directors. Carla Gugino did relatively nothing to further the storyline other than to serve as the alternate voice of conscience and parenting expert for Mr Potter. But amongst all the supporting members perhaps it is Ophelia Lovibond who impresses the most playing probably the only quirky character in the film as Pippi Mr Potter's assistant who speaks quality English and enunciates them with lyrical quality and what more having a penchant to construct sentences whose words begin with the letter P. It's a constant tongue twister alright but Ophelia pulls this off so convincingly that it's hard to imagine anyone else stepping into the role.If penguins are your thing and CGed ones at that and a familykid friendly outing to the cinema is something you need to plan for then you will not want to miss this opportunity. Otherwise Mr Popper's Penguins offer nothing outside those healthy moral messages except perhaps to laugh at very rude penguins which fart and crap almost everywhere.".

	schema:reviewBody "Adults might have to stretch their patience to accommodate the level of absurdity inherent with the improbability and impracticality of a New York businessman raising six penguins in his apartment but Mr. Popper's Penguins isn't really meant for the discerning viewer. Children who find bumbling chubby creatures entertaining won't have any complaints and the parallel of a familial bond with the unity of a waddle of penguins isn't the worst moral message one could offer young kids. Yet there are those of us who feel that Jim Carrey while not entirely insufferable as a father of two children and six flightless birds could be doing grander things.While Tom Popper Jim Carrey pushes for a promotion at his property purchasing partnership he finds himself further parted from his exwife Amanda Carla Gugino and his children Billy Maxwell Perry Cotton and Janie Madeline Carroll. When he unexpectedly procures six penguins from his estranged pop's possessions and Billy mistakes the pesky pets for his birthday present Popper determines to protect his plumaged companions. As he struggles to balance providing for his new patrons with the pressures of his persistent employers Popper must also attempt to reconnect with his family while parrying the pernicious plotting of a pushy zoo proprietor Clark Gregg intent on poaching the penguins for his own prehensile purposes.The biggest problem with Mr. Popper's Penguins is the lack of realism. Although it is clearly fantasy and targeting a youthful audience the complete disregard for repercussions and consequences is ludicrous especially given that the police and a dutiful nemesis zookeeper are included specifically for the purpose of control and reasoning. We had fun but it's time to get back to reality says Popper when the authorities step in and the penguins are momentarily treated like real animals in need of professional care. The whole movie might have worked more believably if it were animated. It's bad enough that the CG penguins are completely visually distinguishable from their live action trained counterparts.Jim Carrey is right at home in the role of a nonsensical overacting idiosyncratic man desperately struggling to mend his shattered romantic relationship and separation from his kids  the same kind of character he's been playing his entire career and most likely nothing like the popular source material the filmmakers probably tried in vain to reel him in. With gags such as a woman who sputters extreme alliteration the typical soccer ball to the groin the tuxedosuited waddlers strolling through the Guggenheim and a crowded New York street unnoticed and penguin excrement squirted in the face Mr. Popper's Penguins is unfathomably awkward bland unoriginal uninspired and largely pointless. The dialogue and situations are pitiful and the supporting characters provide little relief from Carrey's obnoxiousness.

As in all stories about war that are honest there is no clear line between right and wrong between survival and heroism and it is to Madsen's credit that he keeps us in the shadows with every encounter.

It begins with one of the heroes vomiting in the street as a result of watching victorious Nazi troops rolling into the capital city of his small European nation. Almost immediately we are swept up into the heroes' terror as they perform grotesque coldblooded murders in the name of national insurgency. Brilliant performances by Thure Lindhardt and Mads Mikkelsen involve us in the personal crises of honest citizens who are forced by war into the roles of brutal hitmen. As the action proceeds their predicament becomes only worse as they doubt the validity of their orders and ultimately the integrity of the ordergivers. The 'third reel' of the film is an ongoing crisis and the outcome is not pretty. The only survivors are the sociopaths who sold out in their various charming ways. The story depicts the multilayered nature of an occupied society and the different commitments of its members  to their country to their offshore bank balances and to their own skins. Even Flame  Citron selfless insurgent heroes are compromised no one comes out of the Third Reich smelling of roses.

	schema:reviewBody "I don't know what to say about this movie. Original setting for many of us Flame  Citron is based on the lives of two resistance fightersassassins Citron  Flame in occupied Denmark back in World War Two. The premise is that our leads are on order to do their killings but their own aim is to kill the leader of the local Gestapo unit. However realpolitik double crossing selfpreservation and a femme fatale all just get in the way of everything so our lead duo have no option but to battle as much with their own as with the occupiers. Personal relationship problems for our duo helps to keep the film human and the story never glamorises the pair and in many ways does show them to be quite amateurish despite their legendary status even showing their botched jobs.So how does it all go? Well it's not an easy one to follow. Many a time not sure what to make of the storyline if we were to really learn much. The whole realpolitik aspect of the piece never seems to resolve and with so many sides in this film it's hard to keep up. In fairness that was likely the main point showing the true difficulty of war as each group seems to play off of each other for their own ends whatever they may be. This is a weakness overall and with its length quite tiresome.Acting in general is faultless and beautiful shots of the Scandanavian countryside plus panoramic views of the cities are great on the eye but some bad camera work at times is just really amateurish and spoils things.Overall a good film that is interesting and a newish angle for WW2 films. Some very good points and most will like it but not as special as it possibly could have been.".

My opinion of what we Danes manage to put together in the medium of film is hardly a secret... I tend to find myself underwhelmed. Before tonight I only really considered two such recent features truly greatthe more notable of those in my view being Murk and well... as clich as it is that number is now three. The plot is magnificent and the twists so marvelous and unexpected. There is maybe one thread that I found unsatisfying perhaps especially because of how much attention was paid to it but that's it. The acting is excellent... the one bad performance was had by a kid and it didn't need to be better than it was. Lindhardt and Mikkelsen haven't a single weak moment between them and Mygind... thumbs up. The cinematography is spectacular though I did find the all in all relatively few zooms a bit distracting save for one or twothese may be a Scandinavian thing something similar appeared in Show Me Love. The editing is effective... the actiondo note that this is not a straighton piece within that genre works the drama likewise and the only real criticism I can come with in this area is that there are a handful of places where things could be clearer. The writing there is infinitely little to complain about and a long line of positives about including the psychology the complexity the charactersthe consistency of which is almost entirely flawless and the only real problem within that is really how at least one major character disappears from the movie and the incredibly accurate depiction of the time the environment the types of people. This is remarkably engaging. There is a little sexuality and some language as well as a measure of violence but I wouldn't call any of it gratuitous. You do need a basic knowledge about the period the place and the people before watching this but hey nowhere near as much is required as for Der UntergangDownfall. I don't know if this is entirely historically accurate but little heck hardly any is Hollywoodized and it's undeniably entertaining and strong. I recommend this to any fan of drama and anyone who wants a visual representation of the situation this revolves around. 810".

It's gritty and moody it has tension and good music and great dramatic filming the light and the camerawork are both very clean and yet provocative.But this cinematic prowess gets in the way of the movie a little and the plot is slow enough that you begin to watch the surfaces of things as you go. In fact some of the scenes eating around large tables meeting in broad gloomy almost beautiful basements are just too pretty to support the ugly events at hand. Or so it seems. It's a vivid film and unique and it is a must see for World War II film buffs just because it's so honest and so different. There are not that many Danish films about the war to start with compared to British and American and German efforts. This one is very bloody and ruthless in both its actions and in the telling of them. Kudos for that but warnings too. As pretty as the filming is it isn't always easy to watch. But that's part of the point getting to what rises above the mere actionis it okay to kill bad people without a trial without warning without knowing even if they are bad at all. What is okay in war?

Thure Lindhardt is very convincing as the flame he matches the picture i have of him since i first read about Flammen. Mads Mikkelsen does a good job and Stine Stengade is lovely.

Everything felt good right from the steel gray sky on down the script props costumes even the major 'watering' holes. The plot moved forward almost as fast as that sordid period lasted in Denmark. The actors especially those who portrayed the two main characters were plausible. Even the Nazi occupiers gave good support though as fierce opposition better make that as brutal suppressors of the Danish 'resistance'.One prominent Nazi Herr Hoffman even as the Copenhagen SS chief at times appeared almost well human. Maybe that wasn't the director's intent. However from where I sat that was the impression Hoffman gave.On the other hand the wiry rimmed Gestapo chief's many speechessoliloquies added little to the plot's progression. Often Hoffman's own words revealed his dark nature. That was expected given who is employers were no?Not well versed in Danish history especially concerning that turbulent WW II period my instincts scream that this film 'told the truth'. And as macabre as many scenes were my sympathies still lay with the Danes. My guess is the period's experts would share my opinion.Even against daunting odds brave little Denmark put up a dogged albeit costly fight. The Big Nazi War Machine though won I think that's no surprise. No doubt that the two main protagonists Flame and Citron as the Resistance's crack enforcers played a most pivotal even momentum changing role.And the film's producersdirector gave much credence to that perspective right to the sad end. My wish is that more films of this genre were produced in the same excellent 9mm caliber.Alas in that same regard there's a conspicuous absence of these true 'gems' in the cinema trade. Moreover Hollywood studios could learn much from the Danish film industry.And you can take that to the Krone bank.".

	schema:headline " Resistance";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a film that cries to be seen by a wider audience. The Danish production directed by Ole Christian Madsen who adapted the material with Lars Andersen based their film in a real wartime incident that involved a lot of courage to carry out. Denmark was invaded in 1940 by Germany. A lot of Danish citizens collaborated with the invaders shamelessly. The resistance movement recruited loyal men and women to fight the odious Nazi force that settled in their country against their best wishes. It was not an easy task to do but among the fighters that came to oppose the Germans were Bent FaurschouHviid whose war name was Flame named so because of his bright red hair and the taciturn Jorgen Haagen Schmidt known as Citron his comrade in arms.The two friends were recruited to be trigger men for the elimination of their fellow Danish who were collaborating openly with the enemy as well as the hated Nazis themselves. It proved to be quite a job to be able to fool the Gestapo that controlled everything in the country. Complicating matters Flame falls for Ketty Selmer a woman that was a double spy. Flame and Citron gave the enemy a run for their money in spite of the odds against the success of their enterprise.The film has a dark look that was enhanced by the camera work of Jorgen Johansson. The Copenhagen of that period is shown in muted colors as befitting the terrible times the country was living under the Nazi rule. The strength of the film lies in what director Madsen was able to create and the ensemble work he got from the cast. One must single out the two principals Thure Lindhardt and Mads Mikklesen who are seen as Flame and Citron respectively. The two men give a credible account of what their characters were going through at the time where the action takes place. Both actors compliment one another in ways that one cannot think of others being cast in their roles. Equally good is Stine Stengade who plays Ketty Selmer the enigmatic woman who inspired a passion in Flame. The rest of the supporting players made an impression with us.Ole Christian Madsen shows talent to spare in this exciting retelling of a WWII episode.".

It was not an easy task to do but among the fighters that came to oppose the Germans were Bent FaurschouHviid whose war name was Flame named so because of his bright red hair and the taciturn Jorgen Haagen Schmidt known as Citron his comrade in arms.The two friends were recruited to be trigger men for the elimination of their fellow Danish who were collaborating openly with the enemy as well as the hated Nazis themselves. It proved to be quite a job to be able to fool the Gestapo that controlled everything in the country. Complicating matters Flame falls for Ketty Selmer a woman that was a double spy. Flame and Citron gave the enemy a run for their money in spite of the odds against the success of their enterprise.The film has a dark look that was enhanced by the camera work of Jorgen Johansson. The Copenhagen of that period is shown in muted colors as befitting the terrible times the country was living under the Nazi rule. The strength of the film lies in what director Madsen was able to create and the ensemble work he got from the cast. One must single out the two principals Thure Lindhardt and Mads Mikklesen who are seen as Flame and Citron respectively. The two men give a credible account of what their characters were going through at the time where the action takes place. Both actors compliment one another in ways that one cannot think of others being cast in their roles. Equally good is Stine Stengade who plays Ketty Selmer the enigmatic woman who inspired a passion in Flame. The rest of the supporting players made an impression with us.Ole Christian Madsen shows talent to spare in this exciting retelling of a WWII episode.";

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of those Danish films which are attracting so much attention these days and the actor Lars Mikkelsen who played Troels in season one of THE KILLING a year earlier 2007 see my review even appears in it. It is a harrowing and ultimately sad tale 'based on a true story'. It depicts the attempts by the Danish Resistance all two of them Flammen og Citronen to struggle against the Nazi Occupation of Denmark. In that respect it offers a view of a familiar subject in an unfamiliar setting and is of considerable interest. The action is exciting but the film has a downbeat quality because the Resistance keeps getting betrayed and whacked. The character called Flame has red hair hence his nickname and is too brave to bother covering it up most of the time though once in a while he is persuaded to wear a beret in the hope that at least his flamered head will be a bit less obvious on his Resistance missions. He goes around murdering collaborators but is under strict orders not to murder Nazis themselves. It is a pity he didn't get more collaborators but then there are always so many of such vermin whenever a country is occupied. There is a very pleasant large caf where Flame and Citron and their friends foregather with Nazi officers often sitting very near them. Considering how well known Flame was meant to be as a 'terrorist' I can't understand why he was never arrested in the caf. But then that's the movies I guess. The film is extremely well made with a great deal of tension and suspense. The director Ole Madsen is highly talented. The performances by Thure Lindhardt and Mads Mikkelsen as Flame and Citron are very good. Lindhardt has appeared in 57 titles despite his youth and Mikkelsen in 41. We have to remember that all these Danish people who are largely unknown to us are really highly experienced pros in their field and that Denmark has produced more than just the film director Carl Dreyer whose work we all know and love. Other people have made films there too since the silent days and because we find it difficult to distinguish between Swedes Norwegians and Danes they have no such problems distinguishing between each other and indeed do nothing but grumble about one another the whole time and ridicule each other's accents we have often not realized who was really a Dane. For instance the director Henning Carlsen who filmed Knut Hamsun's HUNGER 1966 was not a Norwegian at all but a Dane strange as that may seem. And Per Oscarsson the actor who played Hamsun was a Swede. One day we may get all of our Scandinavians sorted out and differentiate between all their broad vowel sounds pinpointing the origin of each. Swedes seem to be the broadest Danes the most clipped and they use 'sen' endings on names instead of 'son'. But until that day comes we should keep an eye on those Danes because they seem to be up to things. And this Danish film is well worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "British film buffs are often critical of Americans for their supposed indifference to foreignlanguage moves but there are signs that the transatlantic phobia about subtitles has now spread to our own shores. Films from continental Europe were once fairly common on British television but they have now all but disappeared from terrestrial channels and even on specialist movie channels like Sky Movies TCM and Film 4 they are few and far between. BBC4 is something of an exception. Following The Killing and Borgen that channel is currently having a loveaffair with all things Danish and it was there that I recently caught Flame  Citron. It is said to be one of the most expensive Danish language movies ever although the budget was only around six million pounds peanuts by Hollywood standards. Most Hollywood producers these days would pay out considerably more than that figure to meet the salary demands of just one of their film's stars. It is loosely based on actual events and deals with the Danish resistance movement during the latter part of World War II. The title refers to the code names of two members of the Holger Danske resistance group Bent FaurschouHviid known as Flame because of his red hair and Jrgen Haagen Schmith known as Citron Danish for lemon because he once worked for the Citroen car company. The film opens in 1943 when the tide of war is starting to turn against Germany Hitherto the Resistance has largely confined itself to sabotage and assassinations of Danish collaborators. Flame and Citron now receive instructions from their controller Aksel Winther to pursue a campaign of attacks against the Nazi occupiers themselves something the Resistance has previously avoided. Films about European Resistance movements made during the war or in the years immediately following it invariably had a simple moral structure. I cannot recall any such movies actually set in Denmark but there were numerous examples about other occupied countries such as The Day Will Dawn and The Heroes of Telemark both about Norway One of Our Aircraft is Missing about the Netherlands and The Guns of Navarone about Greece. The Resistance fighters are invariably shown as unambiguously heroic as are their British or American allies the Germans are unambiguously evil and the local collaborators totally despicable. The film generally ends with our heroes having successfully performed some gallant feat of arms which will render invaluable assistance to the Allied war effort. Flame and Citron is quite different. Despite its World War Two setting it bears more resemblance to a modern spy movie or to a neo noir crime drama than a traditional heroic Resistance film. One might call it on the analogy of the revisionist Western a revisionist Resistance drama. There are no British or American commandos on hand to lend assistance. The attacks which Bent and Jrgen carry out are only of doubtful value to the overall Allied cause. Most importantly the moral boundaries are more blurred. Flame and Citron suffer pangs of conscience over the killings they carry out and never know whom they can trust. Is Winther in league with the Germans or is he in fact pursuing his own personal agenda by settling private scores? Is Ketty the glamorous woman with whom Flame falls in love actually a double agent? Will the attacks on the Germans contribute to the liberation of Denmark or will they simply provoke German reprisals against Danish civilians? Are the Germans in fact all villains? One highranking German officer claims to be part of his country's own antiNazi movement and even if he is lying this claim does at least draw attention to the fact that by no means all Germans were proHitler. The atmosphere of the film is despite occasional action sequences subdued with a muted colour scheme symbolic of the dark shadows which Nazi rule had cast over occupied Europe. Although it does I think finally reach the conclusion that the Resistance effort was worthwhile in that the selfsacrifice involved played a vital role in enabling Denmark to preserve its sense of national honour it does at least dramatise some of the moral dilemmas involved in active resistance to a brutal occupying force. Modern dramas from continental Europe about the war are not particularly common but this is one well worth watching. 710".

Although it does I think finally reach the conclusion that the Resistance effort was worthwhile in that the selfsacrifice involved played a vital role in enabling Denmark to preserve its sense of national honour it does at least dramatise some of the moral dilemmas involved in active resistance to a brutal occupying force. Modern dramas from continental Europe about the war are not particularly common but this is one well worth watching. 710";

	schema:reviewBody "The Little Room 2010 delivers a heart warming story in no nonsense terms without fanfare. The entire concept is elegant. The central character Rose a nurse Florence Loiret Caille prematurely returns to work after a personal neonatal tragedy. On her rounds as community nurse one of her new patients is Edmond Michael Bouquet now in his eighties. Circumstances bring the two into closer contact more frequently so that an unlikely rich bond of friendship gradually but steadily ensues.Far from being the easiest of clients for Rose Edmond is a man who having lost his beloved wife some 40 years earlier has only his unloving and unsupportive son Jacques Joel Delsaut to call 'family'. For Edmond a diabetic life holds few surprises or joys and understandably he is undisturbed at the idea of giving up on the will to live. Somewhat cruelly Jacques intends his father be taken into care so that he may start afresh in New York. That is Edmond's likely fate until the encounter with Rose.While Rose is portrayed as neither glamorous nor affected she possesses a warm heart and clear mind. She encourages Edmond to do the simplest of things such as eating and to accept insulin shots. Few words are exchanged but her presence and willingness to regard Edmond as a man and as a real human being has a profound effect that slowly restores his will to live littlebylittle.A small cooker fire transpires in Edmond's home. Rose is there and deals with it  though black smoke chars the kitchen. The son enters sees the state of the kitchen and along with Rose's boss they both blame her for allowing the fire while also accusing her of becoming too involved. Her boss decides Rose is not yet ready to return to work so soon after losing an unborn child compelling her to take a lengthy vacation.Marc Eric Cavayaka Rose's livein partner chooses to leave her to work abroad. After their separation Rose finds she has ample time available to care for Edmond whom she then takes to her own apartment where he stays. It becomes apparent Rose feels a need to substitute for her lost child by caring for Edmond  in a wholesome way. An undoubted friendship develops. They start to talk dine together and go out. Edmond takes an interest in Rose once he realises that she miscarried and still grieves long after her tragic loss. Rose takes Edmond to her child's cemetery where at the graveside he shows her which plants will last longest. While this may sound sombre or slow it is incredibly touching  the pace of events seem real there's little music  it just comes down to immaculate acting by the two principle leads so that this story works brilliantly.Edmond stays with Rose which they enjoy keeping as their secret while Jacques unaware of this situation eventually reports his father as a missing person. Marc returns to Rose and also forms a bond with Edmond.Dramatically the story picksup apace when Edmond chooses to go on a mission and journeys alone to where memories of his deceased wife are strongest. The effect of Edmond's sudden unannounced disappearance stirs the deepest emotions in Rose.Unfortunately to avoid spoilers this where descriptions of the story stops!!! As so often the case with French cinema a human story is told in a fascinating and gripping way. Stphanie Chaut and Vronique Reymond codirect and cowrite with empathy immaculate timing without interference of intrusive sound tracks and cleverly involve viewers in every characters' situation. This tale is about humanity compassion dignity and life's unexpected events and not for a moment does it drag. A remarkable thing... in Florence Loiret Caille's portrayal of a ordinary dowdy community nurse she plays the part with undeniable charisma and subtly oozes sex appeal. If you can catch this film it should not be missed. It's a treat.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dear Wendy comes from the talents that brought us Festen and It's All About Love both written and directed by Thomas Vinteberg Dogville Dancer in the Dark and Breaking the Waves written and directed by Lars Von Trier. They have collaborated on Dear Wendy with Vinteberg at the helm and penned by Trier. This is my favorite kind of movie it begins with a what if... premise which the storytellers follow with relentless commitment. In this case the premise is what if some misfit kids fell in love with their guns. Well they'd give them names they'd practice shooting and have a secret clubhouse they'd study the famous guntoting heroes of old and the relationship they have with their weapons would become a mirror for their relationships with the world. All of which are pursued beautifully in the film. Quite a few American movie critics read this film as a critique of American society and they resent a European making a film about smalltown America. An oftvented complaint is that Trier has no business criticizing a country which he's never actually visited. I don't think however that this is ultimately a film about guns the relationship these kids have with their guns is simply a unique window through which the filmmakers have chosen to show us the rich inner lives of the protagonists. They could have used a dysfunctional family Festen or movie musicals Dancer In The Dark or a tolling church bell Breaking The Waves to show us that world  but in this case it's guns. Within the limits of the film medium  10000 words of dialog and around 140000 frames of film  the choices of the filmmaker often revolve about what to leave OUT rather than what to put IN. This is a film that could be used as a textbook for economists. The script is tight  not a word out of place although the narration feels conversational and casual. A film about child misfits and their guns could easily follow thematic red herrings all over the place in pursuit of social commentary but Dear Wendy is utterly restrained  in spite of the loaded subject matter. On the cutting room floor are social commentary clich and many of the cinematic crutches which Trier and Vinterberg rejected in their Dogme 95 days.Any film lover who cares to see a film utterly committed to its premise a film made with economy and efficiency a film full of sweet irony a film of deceptive simplicity would do well to check out Dear Wendy.".

One of the main reasons for this is the films use of highly symbolic miseenscene takes several viewings to fully appreciate. Another reason for the let down is that some might be inclined to want more action for a movie that centralizes on guns.However this movie is brilliant. The shot composition the editing the actingthis movie is very well pieced together. Also as for the meaning of the movie it goes in a direction that is a really provocative and fresh. I would highly recommend that you give this movie a chance and keep an open mind. I have never been a fan of the director of this film or the writer but I was deeply pleased by this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "I liked Dear Wendy. It was well photographed had good cast and the rocking soundtrack provided the light icing on a film that is both sad and happy from the inside.It is a bit puzzling that this film has been seen as antiAmerican propaganda. It does criticise the American values  but so do many American films that are hardly described as antiAmerican. The message is even softened by placing the film in surreal small mining town that is so detached geographically that you can almost feel the fiction. In some sense it bears resemblance to the village set on Brechtian stage in Dogville compare for example the stageness of main street by Lars von Trier whose touch can be seen in Dear Wendy too.It can be also seen as an antigun lecture  but that is just one perspective to it and in my opinion also possible to ignore.The only turnoff is the somewhat annoying narration by the main character that explains too much and leaves less for the viewer to ponder. I might be also giving one star too much because the end scene where the film picks up the pace left such a strong impression on me and not just because of being so well shot action.".

I disagree with critics who say the film attacked America or had a heavyhitting message in it. I think it's subtler than that. For me it was the big surprise of Sundance 05. Rich and fun. In the script the characters were twice as old as those in the film and I think Vinterberg made a wise choice in changing that. What is powerful in a teenager can look dorky in a 30something.".

	schema:headline " Von Trier is at it again he's on America's case about hypocrisy violence and injustice";
	schema:reviewBody "All of this recent fuss about David Cronenberg's film A History of Violence. What rot. You want a good film about violence and the gun culture in America? Check out this little gem from the cofounders of Denmark's Dogme 95 movement Thomas Vinterberg The Celebration who directed this film and Lars von Trier who wrote the screenplay.Von Trier drives many American film critics absolutely bonkers because he has the temerity to make films about the American Character even though he apparently has never set either of his personal feet on U.S. soil. First came Dancer in the Dark set in central Washington State then Dogville set somewhere in the Colorado Rockies. The actual locations were European as is the case in Dear Wendy. These earlier films may have had their problems but they nonetheless stung with their unflattering depictions of American hypocrisy greed violence and injustice. The worst thing you can say about von Trier's depictions is that they are derivative hardly novel or unique. Think of Nathaniel Hawthorne or Theodore Dreiser or Ralph Ellison or Don DeLillo  or David Foster Wallace or any number of other authors. Pick from almost any generation of American writers and you'll find these same themes sounded. Because  like it or not  they are valid. And it should come as no surprise that some intelligent foreigner who reads deeply about America might be capable of writing a credible screenplay about our national foibles.Dear Wendy is set in an unnamed mining town sometime before the present day probably the 1960s judging from the musical soundtrack. The town is obviously a false set not a natural location odd since this violates of one of Dogme 95's central tenets to always use natural locations. A miner's son Dick Dandelion Jamie Bell who has carved out a niche it seems playing miner's sons beginning with his splendid performance in Billy Elliot is a misfit too fragile and disinterested to spend his life down the mines. Out of sorts aimless Dick one day buys a toy gun as a gift for a buddy. But he learns from his fellow misfit friend Stevie Mark Webber that this gun is actually a small but real bullet shooting weapon. Stevie as it happens has an obsessive passion for guns gun history and the workings of guns.These two hit upon a plan why not start a little club a cult of losers and outcast young people the town's stray kids and bring a little honor pride and some decent principles of conduct into their lives. No one else is going to give them a break so it's selfhelp time. The club will have a secret headquarters for meetings indoctrination and just hanging out. The unifying themes will be the possession and adulation of firearms juxtaposed with pacifism is this an amusingly ironic riff on our culture or what ?! Members will learn to love their guns to name them to vivify imagined relationships to their guns. But they will also be honor bound never to use them to commit violent acts against others not to mention each other.The group is named The Dandies presumably after Dick's surname and grows to include Susan Alison Pill Huey Chris Owen Freddie Michael Angarano and Sebastian Danso Gordon. An aging black woman Clarabelle Novella Nelson eventually becomes a sort of honorary member or more precisely someone whom The Dandies find need to protect from harm once the going gets rough.And the going does get rough. We know that it will only be a matter of time before the idyllic fantasy life shared by this noble little band is somehow shattered by violence. This force arrives in the form of Sheriff Krugsby Bill Pullman and a legion of police sharpshooters. It's the gunfight at the Not Very OK Corral. Without getting into further particulars I will say that the final shootout between The Dandies and Pullman's legion is conducted with an awesome display of police firepower that absolutely resembles the massive use of high tech weaponry that we are accustomed to witnessing when America goes to war whether abroad or in quelling domestic uprisings think of Fallujah and Waco.All the actors I have named deliver good turns. I was especially impressed by Bill Pullman Jamie Bell and Mark Webber. The sound track features several songs by the 60s British poprock band The Zombies including their great hits She's Not There and Time of the Season. More than anything to me this film feels a lot like a couple of Gus Van Sant's movies. The Dandies adopt period costumes as well as arcane stylized manners like the street people in My Own Private Idaho and the notion of outcast young people bearing weapons of course permeates Elephant in a similarly lyrical manner.I think Dear Wendy is a powerful film brimming with poetic truth about us. Yes it is polemical one sided provocative. It may be only half the truth ignoring our national virtues. And the slant may be familiar. But Vinterberg and von Trier have teamed up to make a decent movie about our seemier side. In English. My rating 810 B. Seen on 121105. If you'd like to read more of my reviews send me a message for directions to my websites.".

He falls pretty much in love with this gun names it Wendy and forms a type of gang The Dandies who are pacifists although they do love their weapons.Obviously things do not work out well.The whole style of the film is strange. Virtually all of it is narration which is then developed in a few conversations or and for the most part shown and illustrated through what we see occur. It is also rather on the surreal side. I don't mean melting watches or anything just well surreal.And I really liked it. The detached position the audience is placed in by not being able to engage with any of the characters except through the letters Dick writesnarrates. And the very fact that we're never quite sure what the film is about. Is it antigun or just anti the culture that seems to love guns and violence yet wants to hide it away? Or is it a praise of their idealism? And lets not forget the humour. If you can't laugh at this film I don't think you'll enjoy it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I found this film like a year ago or so and mostly I wanted to watch it just because Lars von Trier wrote it. I'm not his biggest fan and I hate the way he treats actresses but by then I had just watched Manderlay a film that I loved and Dear Wendy looked extremely interesting even with the title that it has in my country it is called Calles Peligrosas that means something like Dangerous Streets and for a fact the terrific Martin Scorsese 1973 film Mean Streets has the exact same title in my country!. Anyway like a year ago I saw it and I really liked it yesterday I saw it again and I still liked it a lot I think even more. First of all it is quite entertaining and even exiting since it features the creation of something new that for their creators is the way to spend their days and with that the way to live. Is like a very known subject the fact that some persons in the same situation find in their club a new world that nobody else will understand. However this is a work of Lars von Trier and yes it can be seen as the bastard project of his USA Land of Opportunity trilogy. Here we have Dick Jamie Bell as the main character. In the town where he lives if you don't work at the mine you will be seeing as a loser. Dick is alone but soon he will find a friend a friend that will make closer his relationship with Stevie Mark Webber and later with some others that like him feel that they are losers. That mentioned friend is a gun and Dick will call it Wendy. Dick bought it thinking that it was a toy gun and not even for him he is a pacifist but as a present for a boy who was not his fried at all. Call it destiny or whatever but that gun never left Dick and eventually he found that was not a toy it was one of the things that make the world an evil place one of those that he hated. Everything started mostly just like a game for two friends a secret game that soon became like the thing they were waiting all the day for. They became experts on the subject and with the power of knowing that they were carrying a gun they felt happiness and since they were so damn generous and were concern about others like them they decided to share their experiences with other three persons Chris Owen Alison Pill and Michael Angarano to be now The Dandies. Pacifists in love with guns well that's what this film shows a bunch of young and intelligent persons that became even brilliant in what they were doing these persons were living in their own little world with their own rules and rituals and since they were pacifists everything seems to be just a game and seems that these kids knew what they were doing. Eventually they will be part again of the world with the character Sebastian Danso Gordon. Sebastian killed a person and needs to have like a guard so the office Krugsby Bill Pullman give that mission to Dick. Is quite interesting since Sebastian is an unarmed criminal who wants a cure. Dick and pals are armed decent persons and here we have the classic fight in order to be the leader with both Dick and Sebastian but finally the important issue is the fact that in the end there's a fight with everyone armed. The Dandies wanted a good thing but they were armed and violence makes only more violence. Sure in their world they had their own believes and sure they were pacifist but everything was turned around the guns so is the time of the season for loving...A very strange photography and great performances I hated Billy Eliot but here Bell is great as the main role as that lonely kid that began having even an obsession a madness that after all ended in the only possible way he would like to and that resume everything what a gun could made in him in his mind. Dear Wendy is definitely an overlooked little gem that I would like to recommend. And the Zombies all around with She's Not There and Time of the Seasons obviously. Fantastic!Well no one told me about her the way she lied Well no one told me about her how many people cried But it's too late to say you're sorry How would I know why should I care Please don't bother trying' to find her She's not thereWell let me tell you 'bout the way she looked The way she'd act and the colour of her hair Her voice was soft and cool Her eyes were clear and bright But she's not thereWell no one told me about her what could I do Well no one told me about her though they all knew But it's too late to say you're sorry How would I know why should I care Please don't bother trying' to find her She's not there".

	onyx:emotionText "I found this film like a year ago or so and mostly I wanted to watch it just because Lars von Trier wrote it. I'm not his biggest fan and I hate the way he treats actresses but by then I had just watched Manderlay a film that I loved and Dear Wendy looked extremely interesting even with the title that it has in my country it is called Calles Peligrosas that means something like Dangerous Streets and for a fact the terrific Martin Scorsese 1973 film Mean Streets has the exact same title in my country!. Anyway like a year ago I saw it and I really liked it yesterday I saw it again and I still liked it a lot I think even more. First of all it is quite entertaining and even exiting since it features the creation of something new that for their creators is the way to spend their days and with that the way to live. Is like a very known subject the fact that some persons in the same situation find in their club a new world that nobody else will understand. However this is a work of Lars von Trier and yes it can be seen as the bastard project of his USA Land of Opportunity trilogy. Here we have Dick Jamie Bell as the main character. In the town where he lives if you don't work at the mine you will be seeing as a loser. Dick is alone but soon he will find a friend a friend that will make closer his relationship with Stevie Mark Webber and later with some others that like him feel that they are losers. That mentioned friend is a gun and Dick will call it Wendy. Dick bought it thinking that it was a toy gun and not even for him he is a pacifist but as a present for a boy who was not his fried at all.

	schema:reviewBody "Dear Wendy is an ironic movie about a group of youths who discovers their fascination for firearms. Although non violent and self declared pacifists they discover that packing a gun and organizing themselves in a underground group called The Dandies gives them moral strength and self esteem in everyday life. They swear never to use or show their weapons outside the abandoned mine they are using as a shooting range but of course it all goes wrong in the end.Persiflaging American gun culture small towns and westerns the movie contains several themes. Obviously it is about how we all have a sometimes even erotic fascination for guns in us regardless of how left winged and peaceful we are. Just see the video clips of the actors trying out the guns and the fascination in their eyes on the official site dearwendy.dk. It is also about the personal relationship many Americans have about the use of guns and the sexual meaning of guns. The Dandies are taking this to the extreme by naming their guns calling them partners writing poems and love letters to them and using the metaphor love making for the absolute forbidden thing Using the gun against another human.The setting is director Thomas Vinterbergs idea of a run down mine city somewhere in midwestern USA. It is not a realistic American town but more like the setting of a play in a theater with all the clichs A coffee drinking sheriff a general store macholike mine people etc.The movie ends with a spaghetti westernlike bullit spraying showdown accompanied by the tones of Glory glory Halleluja Don't take the movie too serious or get offended you Americans out there it is meant ironic.   The movie challenges you. First of all you also get fascinated by the guns. But you also sense that it is somehow wrong. You want to identify with the Dandies but also you know how insane and appalling the whole thing is A feeling you never get by watching an ordinary Hollywoodblockbuster. So you leave the movie theater with mixed emotions and by questioning your own moral believes vs. the instincts and fascination for the evil the weapons represent instincts who by definition lies inside you as a human.".

	schema:reviewBody "I went to see Dear Wendy thinking that it was some kind of statement about guns. It's not. As someone said it's a lot more subtle than that.I tend to like Dogme films. I give high ratings to movies like Dancer In The Dark 10 and The King Is Alive 9 because they are shockfull of mindwringing symbolism. It's Art with a capital A. Such movies as well as their counterparts in other media like literature really all have the same basic plot chronicling the human condition and all the biggest and most abstract questions in life. Where they're different is in the WAY they do it. Which symbols and metaphors they use which story they pretend to tell while really saying something else on a deeper nonliteral level.There is a long artistic tradition of turning things upsidedown. Using a reverse perspective as a new twist on an old tale. That's what we have in Dear Wendy too where the Dandies represent artists and the guns represent the object of artists truth and beauty. And the guns ultimately are used against the established authorities to bring about a social transformation. Hence the amazing Glory Glory Hallelujah finale which is not ironic at all it heralds the success of the mission of art and artists the transformation of society. But this can be understood only by transposing the symbolism to the real world it is symbolized in the movie's universe only by the completion of the mission to get Clarabelle through the policeinfested square to have coffee in Cynthia's apartment. But that is the concentrated symbol of the Dandies' success and ability the one great task that they needed to perform and the completion of which made the artists themselves redundant no longer needed. Because when the mission of art has succeeded art in the classic sense is vindicated and humanity will finally have stepped out of its petty squabblefilled infancy and on to bigger and better things. That's what art is for and that's the story this movie tells in highly stylized and metaphorical terms.Dear Wendy is a good art movie but must be judged against other good art movies and as such I give it an 9 out of 10. I felt that much of the time the entertainment value wasn't great and the acting was not on par with the positively stunning performances Von Trier usually gets out of his casts see The Idiots for example and Breaking The Waves or that Kristian Levring got from the cast of The King Is Alive. But then I gather Dear Wendy is not officially and technically a Dogme film although it certainly does have the exact Dogme type of content. Director Vinterberg's contribution to the story was inspired and demonstrated that he got the point of the script but in its capacity as an artist's vision I feel that the movie is much more a Von Trier movie than a Vinterberg movie.".

I wonder if the actors and the director really knew that? There has been so much talk about the serious message antigunantiAmerican of the movie that it makes me wonder.I've read several times that the original script by Lars von Trier was about a bunch of thirtysomethings. If they had stuck to that concept it would have been a lot like Trier's earlier movie The Idiots only with guns. That explains a lot. The movie might have worked better in some respects. Instead we get a very cute bunch of naive teenagers which I guess is nice also.Visually and soundtrackwise the movie is very interesting. Kind of like a spaghetti western.

	schema:reviewBody "First of all Dear Wendy is a tribute to Kubrick We have the gang from A clockwork Orange the gun named Lyndon and the ancient guns from Barry Lyndon. And there are more subtle references a chart from one of the bullets reads Full Metal Jacket etc.Although directed by his friend Vinterberg the story is written by von Trier and bears all the marks of a von Triermovie but this time it is deeply drawn up in irony. A typical Von Trierstory always watches like literature idealist gains strength from his beliefs but is confronted by the real world in this case an excon his beliefs are shaken and selfimposed rules are broken. And enter the tragedy.The USsetting fits the teasing we are now familiar with from von Trier but the wider meaning is much more universal and it raises several interesting questions. Can a society be free of gun violence when people have guns readily available US vs Switzerland? Is gun culture and adoration a wider problem than guns themselves? Or do people need guns in order to rise against any form of eventual dictatorship? What does pacifism mean? This is a very refreshing movie from Vinterbergvon Trier. It is an interesting study in irony and gun culture with good camerawork from Anthony Dod Mantle and interesting special effects. Would certainly have made a splash and controversy at Cannes.".

And there are more subtle references a chart from one of the bullets reads Full Metal Jacket etc.Although directed by his friend Vinterberg the story is written by von Trier and bears all the marks of a von Triermovie but this time it is deeply drawn up in irony. A typical Von Trierstory always watches like literature idealist gains strength from his beliefs but is confronted by the real world in this case an excon his beliefs are shaken and selfimposed rules are broken. And enter the tragedy.The USsetting fits the teasing we are now familiar with from von Trier but the wider meaning is much more universal and it raises several interesting questions.

It strikes a perfect balance between making a specific political message critique of American gun laws gun culture the western and gangster movie genres and a more mythic tale about adolescence in western cultures. Best of all Dear Wendy is not a merely straightforward antigun statement rather it's a mediation on the gun's doggedly sexy reputation in western cultures. Not only are the characters finding their dear guns nearly worthy of marriage despite their pacifist views but we the viewers again despite any of our own pacifist views end up seduced as well... teamed with The Zombies soundtrack perhaps anything could look sexy.".

The first cut of the film that comes from their later action sequence is completely unnecessary anyone can see the conflict coming from a mile away. The perversion of the group's innocence by Sebastian's realitytempered attitudes are all too typically applied to a young black man and the only one in the county and hence the plot goes crashing to the ground as yet another inescapable fall from paradise.Whatever Kubrickreaching attempts of psychedelic grandeur that the director tries to conjure up never manage to hit home through the potentially interesting lens of the group's fascination with guns nor do they provide an experience that has not been seen 100 times before because of the focus on trippy nouveau montages instead of the characters' individual depth.Ultimately the attraction of the gun to Dick is that he feels more powerful more selfassured carrying it.

Fortunately I was proved wrong and the kooky offkilter world of Electric Square and its mining town environs seems to spring up with life and potential. This film has an unusual style. It's casual and distant barely affecting you or showing an interest a bit like the teenage characters it is portraying who by the way have set up a 'pacifist gun club' where the guns have names and are carried in public but never brandished. The confidence afforded by carrying the firearms brings at least perceived new social standing to the group but as is the nature of guns it ultimately brings them from being outcasts to being outlaws and the final showdown with the sheriff's forces. It's all a bit unbelievable and fantastical but such are the teenage years. The cast is strong and not typical of the usual teenage casting of looks and shiny teeth. Goodbye to the Old West and hello to the New created here with gusto and accompanied by an amazing Zombiesdominated soundtrack!".

However their proclaimed pacifistic approach to gun control isn't shared with the rest of the small mining community From the beginning the movie's message is quite clear. Written by USA critic Lars Von Trier the movie conveys a negative opinion of American gun laws. Regrettably this message precedes the credibility of the movie's plot and characters. No matter how hard the actors struggle they remain mere stage props.None of the actors are major stars. Best known is probably Bill Pullman who some will remember from Independence Day and Lost Highway. However all roles are cast fittingly and the performances are satisfactory.Another point of criticism is the constant voiceover that explains everything you're watching. The voiceover is reasonably justified still the best scenes in the movie are the few that are allowed to stand on their own.The splendid pale pictures are done by Anthony Dod Mantle who worked on both Thomas Vinterberg and Lars Von Trier's latest movies It's All About Love and Dogville. Sadly this excellent cinematography is the best part of the movie.Dear Wendy touches an interesting and relevant topic. Still that doesn't make the movie an artistic success.

	schema:reviewBody "So I saw the trailer for the film a while back and checked it out thinking it was a pretty neat idea for a film. I was let down however by the supreme lack of intelligent conversation within the film itself. The idea for a film about the fetishism of guns and the failure of and ideal is something that could've been nice if well executed. I mean the dandies with music by the zombies... that's just bad ass. However the few stylized moments in the film are not well integrated into the structure of the film at all first off. The narration by Jamie Bell is completely unconvincing the storyline is ridiculously clichd and pretty inconsequential in the end. It's an interesting discussion but an unnecessarily facile one in this film. Von Trier's aggravation with the 'America' as represented by the second amendment right to bear arms is constantly present as the film attempts to render such regard for power etc... a completely outdated and useless ideal whether the straightup naming of the pistols Lee and Grant or Bell's character being placed between a Confederate and American flag both faded on the side of a barn the discussion is heavyhanded and in the end fairly uninteresting. And when the film does try to pull off the cool it's so rigid and again clichd that it just comes off as film school jackassery. None of the characters are very welldeveloped instead depending on the alltoo overstated plot to carry the film. When viewed as a metaphor for the Dogme 95 film movement though the film could possibly take on a different meaning. The good intentions of this new discipline owning and caring for a gun the vow of chastity the payoffs with the new discipline but the eventual decay and ironic use of the very thing held so highly against them... Maybe that's shallow but I think that it could possibly be more universally a statement on the hypocrisy of or cycle of the ideal taking over and turning on it's own principles in the end. I'm not sure that that makes the film any better but it's more interesting than the overworn gun violence idea... to me at least.".

	schema:headline " Precode Stanwyck ROCKS";
	schema:reviewBody "Baby Face is a precode melodrama starring a very young Barbara Stanwyck an almost unrecognizable George Brent and Theresa Harris. It's about a girl who goes to the city to make good...or should I say make time. Stanwyck's father has been pimping her for one reason or another her whole life in dingy depressed filthy Erie Pennsylvania. After her father dies one older father type who knows what she's been through and truly cares about her future advises her to go to the big city and take advantage of opportunities there  and not the easy ones  and to take the high road in life. Note that I saw the censored version and not the uncut  this part of the film was redone for the censors. She and Chico Harris go to New York where Lily nickname Baby Face decides the low road's a lot smoother and will get her where she wants to go a lot faster. In the movie's most famous scene the camera moves us up the corporate ladder by taking us from floor to floor as Lily sleeps her way to the top. She finally corrals the big man himself and is able to quit her day job. Trouble follows and she's soon involved in a huge scandal.Stanwyck wears lots of makeup and for most of the film is cool as a cucumber as she seduces one man after another with no regrets and she's great at playing the innocent victim. In one scene she sits staring at a king's ransom in jewels while wearing a black dress that looks like it's decorated with diamonds at the top. Then she asks Chico for another case and that's filled with more jewelry plus securities. All in a day's work.Theresa Harris was an interesting talent  she could be played down or glamorous and was a talented singer and dancer as well. Here she sings or hums the movie's theme St. Louis Woman throughout. She worked in literally dozens of movies and is very good here as a friend of Stanwyck's her best work being in the precode era. As a bizarre byproduct of the code blacks were often given less to do in films after it was put in place.Precode films could be more sexually blatant and therefore though they're 70 years old seem more modern. Even though these films didn't have to have moral endings Baby Face learns her lessons  how like life it is after all. There were several endings of this film all with the same message. The one I saw had an added scene but apparently there were two other endings that didn't pass the censors. There wasn't a code but there were always censors. At any rate it's a neat surprise. Baby Face is an important film in movie history  a must see.".

Barbara Stanwyck conveys the necessary nuances to show that though she sleeps her way to the top literally she still has good in her heartnote the way she treats those few who have been kind to her such as Chico the marvelous actress Theresa Harris and the old philosopher. And though she exploits her sexuality to make mush of men who are rich and powerful those same men are attempting to exploit her for their carnal desires with no intention of permanent ties until they fall in love with her.Lily Powers fails to understand at first that emotions are difficult to ride that it's easy to lose control. One possible result is death. Hitching a wagon to a star of course materialism can take one to a destination where nothing else exists but the ephemeral and it's a cold lonely location.A word should be said about the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche whose will to power is stressed in Baby Face by the elderly philosopher who befriends Lilly when she is still turning tricks for her old man. Baby Face was released the same year Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. Though it's highly unlikely that the semiliterate Hitler understood much about Nietzsche he considered himself a Nietzschean to the nth degree and touted it along side his other rantings. Baby Face serves as an indictment of the popular interpretation of Nietzsche's will to power concept especially in the final scenes.Although You've got the cutest little baby face. is apropos as a theme for Baby Face an even more telling and applicable melody is W.

St. Louis Blues is also used wisely toward the end as Lily begins to see beyond materialism to eternal values. Chico is singing a raw salacious version of St. Louis Blues when Lily now disagreeing with the lyrics orders her to stop.The restored version of Baby Face makes the film more modern in its approach and attitude toward sex as power than many a new Hollywood release.

Green stars the young and forceful Barbara Stanwyck in a precode drama that has gathered a bad reputation in its initial release only to become a cult favorite decades later thanks to frequent revivals on the Turner Classic Movies cable channel. A hot item it its day the initial 45 minutes of BABY FACE is hardhitting and fastpace with intentional or unintentional funny lines combined. Only after the arrival of costar George Brent does the story begin to lose steam. Only when it begins to recover some strength during its concluding minutes the film fails to recapture whatever essence it had during the initial three quarters of an hour.The focal point is on Lily Powers Barbara Stanwyck the sassy daughter of Nick Robert Barrat an abusive father of the slums of Pittsburgh who has her working as a barmaid in his speakeasy entertaining lowlife factory working friends. After Nick is killed in an explosion by which Lily watches showing no remorse or emotion whatsoever decides on leaving her hometown accompanied by her friend Chico Theresa Haris on a freight train for New York City. Upon her arrival Lily uses whatever life has taught her to get ahead rising up the corporate latter of a banking firm by showing her feminine wiles to full advantage. Becoming responsible for the breakup between banker Ned Stevens Donald Cook and his fiance Ann Carter Margaret Lindsay followed by a murdersuicide the notorious scandal finds Lily about to transferred to the Paris branch until she captures the attention of Trenholm George Brent the new president of the Botham Trust Company as her latest victim.Featured in the supporting cast are Douglass Dumbrille Brody another one of Lily's love slaves Nat Pendleton Stolvich a sleazy factory worker Maynard Holmes a personnel office clerk with Alphonse Ethier Henry Kolker and Charles Coleman in smaller roles. Along with Dumbrille Cook and Kolker as men who fall prey to a gal called Lily the biggest surprise is finding the youthful John Wayne years prior to his major star status as one of Lily's rejected suitors. Wayne's role as an office clerk is brief but noteworthy as being the one and only collaboration of the Duke and Stanny. James Murray the leading actor in MGM's silent masterpiece THE CROWD 1928 in a career setback by this time appeared briefly as a railroad brakeman. His scene however was taken out prior to its release. A director's complete cut that included Murray and other edited scenes were later discovered and presented on TCM for the first time December 4 2006.A dress rehearsal for some of her latter toughasnails dramas as DOUBLE INDEMNITY 1944 and THE STRANGE LOVES OF MARTHA IVERS Paramount 1946 for example Stanwyck plays Lily Powers to the hilt a strongwilled woman with a lot of hate especially towards men. When pitting them to their own destruction her eyes stay motionless detailing reactions through silence rather than with words. Regardless of movie title and popular song by Benny Davis and Harry Akst scored during the opening credits that could have served as a Broadway musical about a cute chorus girl Stanwyck hardly a baby face by any means is referred to as such once by Jimmy McCoy John Wayne and office secretaries one played by Toby Wing but never referred to that name again. Aside from other songs I Kiss Your Hand Madame is underscored several times during the latter portion of the story.A forerunner to the trash movies of the 1960s and 70s what makes BABY FACE so watchable is the explicit way it uses sex and immorality out of camera range leaving questionable situations to the imagination of the viewer. A prime example is witnessing Lily's job promotion up the corporate latter with the camera panning from the outside office window from personnel filing mortgage and accounting departments to the underscoring of burlesquetype music.Could anyone else but Barbara Stanwyck handle such an assignment as depicted in BABY FACE? Joan Blondell another resident Warner Brothers stock player perhaps considering how Stanwyck's blonde hairstyle bears a strong resemblance to Blondell's especially during the more glamorized moments in the film's second half. Blondell might have handled her task well but the major difference is that Blondell as good as she is or was wouldn't have handled the forcefulness the way Stanwyck had. Stanwyck a brunette was at her best playing nasty blondes especially here and a decade later in DOUBLE INDEMNITY 1944.Aside from BABY FACE as one of the favorites shown on TCM it did have some exposure during the early 1990s on Turner Network Television TNT and distribution to home video as part of Leonard Maltin's Forbidden Hollywood series and finally on DVD. For a worthwhile introductory to precode movies either the complete or theatrical edited release of BABY FACE along with Stanwyck's earlier NIGHT NURSE 1931 should be tops in the assembly line. 12".

	schema:reviewBody "This one is considered a key PreCode film  from the director who later made the musical biopic THE JOLSON STORY 1946 but also the paranoid scifi INVASION U.S.A. 1952!  and features one of Barbara Stanwyck's best early roles.She's supported by a fine cast which includes popular actors and valued character performers of the day  George Brent Douglass Dumbrille Edward van Sloan Nat Pendleton and John Wayne at one point addressing Stanwyck with the titular nickname derived from a popular song which is heard constantly throughout in the former category and in the latter Robert Barrat as Stanwyck's father Donald Cook as her most tragic conquest Alphonse Ethier as her elderly mentor  more on this later Arthur Hohl as a lecherous politician and Henry Kolker as Cook's boss and fatherinlaw whom Stanwyck also seduces. Curiously scenes in which Walter Brennan appeared were subsequently deleted at his own request when the film ran into trouble with the censors!Abetted by crackling i.e. typically hardboiled dialogue and realistic Anton Grot sets the narrative contains unexpected overtones of Nietzschean philosophy fed to our smalltown heroine by the intellectual Ethier Stanwyck complains to him early on that she's no ball of fire which of course contradicts her later comedy  directed by Howard Hawks and costarring Gary Cooper  of that name!. Under Ethier's auspices she quickly blooms into an essentially heartless character determined that nothing shall stand in her path to success the symbolic depiction of her rise in stature at the New York firm she's eventually employed with is reminiscent of a similarly sardonic one  relating to an ambitious statesman's lust for power  in Sergei Eisenstein's October 1927! Sociologically it's also interesting that Stanwyck is constantly seen sticking her neck out for her black maidcompanion.The first twothirds of the film are simply terrific at first I found the latter stages somewhat disappointing  because I was expecting to see Stanwyck get her comeuppance by falling for the belatedlyintroduced George Brent character while he ignores herbut just like the others he's soon under her spell! On second viewing however this aspect felt less jarring  as it's evident that Stanwyck has been affected by the two deaths her selfish behavior has caused and that her tenure in Paris has softened her even if she tries to cling to her hardearned wealth for as long as it's possible.Released on DVD by Warners as part of their FORBIDDEN Hollywood VOLUME 1 COLLECTION the film is presented in two strikingly different edits  a recently unearthed PreRelease version and the tamer Theatrical Release print. Among the considerable footage cut from the latter is dialogue pertaining to Stanwyck's life as a tramp from the age of 14 though it's heard in the accompanying trailer! while many other scenes have been shortened i.e. censored for content the violent fisticuff which develops between Stanwyck and Hohl after she resists his advances the seduction at the railroad car the scene in which Dumbrille is surprised with Stanwyck by Cook the shooting followed by a suicide only shots are heard in the shorter version Stanwyck thinking about her conquests while the phonograph is playing again only Brent appears in the version released to theaters etc. Tha latter then utilizes alternate takes for some scenes  and includes an establishing shot of the city which is missing from the longer version however we also get an obviously tackedon happy ending the PreRelease version concludes abruptly on a very effective openended note and an equally unconvincing cautionary letter sent by Ethier to Stanwyck in New York which basically has the function of substituting all references to Nietzsche!".

Under Ethier's auspices she quickly blooms into an essentially heartless character determined that nothing shall stand in her path to success the symbolic depiction of her rise in stature at the New York firm she's eventually employed with is reminiscent of a similarly sardonic one  relating to an ambitious statesman's lust for power  in Sergei Eisenstein's October 1927! Sociologically it's also interesting that Stanwyck is constantly seen sticking her neck out for her black maidcompanion.The first twothirds of the film are simply terrific at first I found the latter stages somewhat disappointing  because I was expecting to see Stanwyck get her comeuppance by falling for the belatedlyintroduced George Brent character while he ignores herbut just like the others he's soon under her spell! On second viewing however this aspect felt less jarring  as it's evident that Stanwyck has been affected by the two deaths her selfish behavior has caused and that her tenure in Paris has softened her even if she tries to cling to her hardearned wealth for as long as it's possible.Released on DVD by Warners as part of their FORBIDDEN Hollywood VOLUME 1 COLLECTION the film is presented in two strikingly different edits  a recently unearthed PreRelease version and the tamer Theatrical Release print. Among the considerable footage cut from the latter is dialogue pertaining to Stanwyck's life as a tramp from the age of 14 though it's heard in the accompanying trailer! while many other scenes have been shortened i.e. censored for content the violent fisticuff which develops between Stanwyck and Hohl after she resists his advances the seduction at the railroad car the scene in which Dumbrille is surprised with Stanwyck by Cook the shooting followed by a suicide only shots are heard in the shorter version Stanwyck thinking about her conquests while the phonograph is playing again only Brent appears in the version released to theaters etc. Tha latter then utilizes alternate takes for some scenes  and includes an establishing shot of the city which is missing from the longer version however we also get an obviously tackedon happy ending the PreRelease version concludes abruptly on a very effective openended note and an equally unconvincing cautionary letter sent by Ethier to Stanwyck in New York which basically has the function of substituting all references to Nietzsche!";

The revisions really change the tone and character motivations. If you've only ever seen the theatrical release then you must see the uncensored version if only to find out three things 1. That the kindly old man who gives her earnest advice...is not the guy you thought he was. Almost all of his dialogue was cut or redubbed to make him a moral voice of reason in the theatrical release. The scene where he sends her a chastising letter was a revision. Get a load of what he actually tells her and what he actually sends her! Let me put it this way he's a much bigger influence on her behavior than the theatrical release led one to believe. 2. The boxcar scene. Which was cut in it's entirety from the theatrical release. It raised my 2010 eyebrows! Finally 3. The ending when she's listening to her phonograph in the stateroom. Here I'll be specific because this was a change that irritated me. In the theatrical release she's listening to the record and we see that she's thinking about her husband and then she dashes off to find him. In the prerelease version she's listening to the record and she's thinking about ALL of the men who she's been involved with over the course of the movie that got her to where she is finally ending with her husband and a voiceover of him telling her that he knows she's been with a lot of men but he doesn't care he loves her and is determined to make her love him. Then she dashes off to find him. Honestly that makes a big difference! You know she goes back to him because he's the one guy who accepts her for who she is. In the theatrical version she's just suddenly developed random affection for him no reason. So if you can watch the uncensored uncut version. It's absolutely worth your time!".

In the prerelease version she's listening to the record and she's thinking about ALL of the men who she's been involved with over the course of the movie that got her to where she is finally ending with her husband and a voiceover of him telling her that he knows she's been with a lot of men but he doesn't care he loves her and is determined to make her love him. Then she dashes off to find him. Honestly that makes a big difference! You know she goes back to him because he's the one guy who accepts her for who she is. In the theatrical version she's just suddenly developed random affection for him no reason. So if you can watch the uncensored uncut version. It's absolutely worth your time!";

Then his still blows up and he's killed leaving Lily Stanwyck alone cept for her black maid Chico played very nicely by Theresa Harris. Lily leaves for the big city  New York deciding to use her sex to get to the top.

STanwyck is terrific as a girl who really doesn't know what love is.Then in Paris she falls for Courtland played by George Brent they marry but when he's in deep financial straights she bolts. Nearly free with Chico and a halfmillion she realizes she loved Court! Lily races to find him but will she be too late? This is precode Hollywood at its best. Stanwyck is tremendous and the look and music in the film are perfect. This reminded me of Original Sin with Angelina Jolie another unfairly ignored flick with an amoral woman those who disliked that films ultraromantic leanings will not like Baby FAce any better those with belief in sex love and power will love it. Highly recommended! See it!".

	schema:reviewBody "During 1933 this film had many cuts taken from it because it was very over the top for the story content and the fact that Lily PowersBarbara Stanwyck would do anything to obtain great wealth and power. Lily's father had forced his daughter into prostitution at the age of 14 and she grew up in a steel mill of a town with very poor people and her father ran a speakeasy which brought into his home all kinds of male characters who had their eye on Lily. As the story progresses Lily meets up with man after man and eventually finds a guy who has everything and is a playboy bank president It is great to see a very young John Wayne Jimmy McCoy Jr. who was only 25 when this picture was produced and Jimmy did not even get to first base with Lily not even for lunch. A very young George Brent Coutland Trenholm stars along with Barbara Stanwyck and both gave outstanding performances. This is a great film from 1933 which was produced by Darryl F. Zanuck and was locked up in a fault for many years and just recently is being shown on the silver screen. This film is rather mild compared to what we view on the Hollywood screens today but in 1933 it was very naughty to watch this type of film. Enjoy".

	schema:reviewBody "The prerelease version of 1933's Baby Face would make an ideal introduction to a corporate seminar on sexual harassment. Mentored by a Nietszchean professor Lily Powers rises from a life of easy virtue at her father's speakeasy to a rapid climb up the corporate ladder at a large bank. Because each rung of the ladder is an executive with his brain below his belt and his ethics locked in the vault the film has no victims except Lily's childhood which was destroyed by an abusive exploitative father. The destructive relationship with her father suggests Lily's hidden motive for using men to advance without regard for their fate. While Lily is cynical and obvious in her approach the men she targets willingly betray wives and fiancs to trade jobs for sexual favors. Perhaps the bank failures in the 1930's owed less to economics than to morally corrupt executives distracted by ambitious women.The plot moves fast and the camera amusingly moves from window to window up the faade of the office building as Lily climbs ever higher. Barbara Stanwyck reveled in tough hardbitten roles and she is in top form here. Sentiment does not intrude when she is ready to climb the next rung. Only her AfricanAmerican confidante Chico receives Lily's affection trust and loyalty. In more enlightened times the fresh natural beauty of Theresa Harris who plays Chico would have had the men throwing the furs and penthouses at her. Stanwyck often appears overly madeup and stiffly coiffed in comparison to Harris. However despite Stanwyck's tough demeanor obvious tactics and artificial visage she manages to leave a trail of duped and seduced men including Douglass Dumbrille Donald Cook and a young John Wayne.The preferred version of Baby Face is the 76minute restored cut. The edited release version of the film shyly turns from the hard facts which the longer cut restores and makes explicit. Perhaps Darryl Zanuck who wrote the story under an assumed name intended a lesson by quoting from Nietszche whose views on women were controversial. However despite Alphonse Ethier's lectures and advice not to be defeated by life Lily's grab for power and money likely owed more to her upbringing and her father than to her professorial mentor. However the philosophy is but a distraction. Short fast paced and entertaining Baby Face is as contemporary in its morality as Wall Street. Substitute Gordon Gecko for Nietszche and Lily could have declared her guiding philosophy to be greed is good.".

	schema:reviewBody "Watching the 'director's cut' of Baby Face tonight left me a tad disappointed. I could certainly see why it got the attention of the blue noses back in the day. Stuff like child sex abuse simply was not talked about on the screen. You would have to wait over 40 years before you would have a parent be shown blatantly exploiting their child's adolescent sexuality as Robert Barrat does with Barbara Stanwyck. But it certainly does explain why Barbara in this film views men as just steps up the ladder of success. She even traded sexual favors to get transportation in a boxcar on a freight train to New York.Once there she lands a job in a bank and goes up the chain of command with a triple objective in mind wealth independence and security. She starts with teller John Wayne and ends up with the new president George Brent. Of course one of the reasons that this film is also now preserved is because it's the one joint appearance of John Wayne and Barbara Stanwyck. Wayne was at Warner Brothers at this time doing some B westerns with his wonder horse DukeI kid you not but occasionally took supporting roles in other films unusual in itself to see Wayne not the principal in any film. Later on Barbara Stanwyck confessed she would have like to have costarred with him. Certainly their politics would have been compatible. Barbara's availability and her way of exploiting it causes the death of two men and nearly the death of Brent. Yet I have to say it was a cop out ending for this hardhearted woman to all of a sudden discover true love in the last reel and give it all back in an effort to save Brent. That ending was in keeping with the Code even if how she got there became part of forbidden Hollywood.One thing that Baby Face does have that is unusual is the role of the black maid Therese Harris who is by no means servile. She leaves with Stanwyck after Barrat dies and she really is the only confidante she has. Her singing of W.C. Handy's St. Louis Woman comes up at some of the most opportune and inopportune moments in the film.I'd have much preferred Barbara keep all her gotten gains it would have been in keeping with the spirit of the film. Still Baby Face should be seen it's quite bold for its times.".

	schema:reviewBody "To see a precode film like this is to have bawdiness thrown into your face and have all your preconceived notions of the propriety of early Hollywood upended. Baby Face was Warner Bros' attempt to oneup MGM's RedHeaded Woman from the previous year and both films would contribute to the hastening of the Production Code. Jean Harlow flaunted her infidelity and sexuality at every turn openly declaring her trashy beauty with seethrough dresses and a sexual thrill at being struck but Barbara Stanwyck only needed a light caress and one look to bring men to their knees. Vice Presidents aides and bosses walked into the room all thinking to set her straight yet she has other ideas and sends them on their way dazed. It is one of Stanwyck's most electric roles made of smothering closeups and dialogue not merely laced but stinking of suggestion and it points to her scenestealing allure no matter the colour or style of her hair. In one particularly intoxicating scene in The Lady Eve she lies in the lap of Henry Fonda donning that dark halfcut dress and turns a screen icon into putty in her hands. The wardrobe in Baby Face similarly marks her rise from the ashes. Beginning with smalltown rags and a reputation for being the town prostitute she's slept with more men at the film's opening than in Lilian's entire crusade she emerges from the flames of a fateful fire determined to make a name for herself. Soon she has lacy dresses of all sorts dons frilly manes and scarfs of ridiculous proportions and at one point seems to have fat furry ferret wrapped around her neck and back it's a heavy and cumbersome thing. How has she afforded these costumes? Green never shows her truly working but in an audacious sexual metaphor utilises a craning shot that gradually rises from the lowly filing department all the way up to executive offices. She is sleeping her way up the corporate ladder.It was wildly progressive in other ways too. Theresa Harris plays Chico Lily's quiet unassuming black maid one of the last times we would see such subtlety before the mammy character took hold. Chico remains a loyal companion throughout gaining some frilly additions to her dress as well  Lily's insistence that Chico stay by her side while others stared uncomfortably is perhaps the single streak of goodness left in her as she ascends to the top and falls from grace. Yet even before the code censorship boards were still demanding redemption for villains such as Lily Powers if only eventually. Comeuppance wasn't enough she had to be beaten into submission have sentiment reintroduced into her and so the original script's ending of Lily ending up slaving away in a steel mill was scrapped for the romantic realisation in the ambulance. Only then could it be screened to the public a hour of debauchery and immorality only for the conclusion to assert the overpowering values of true love and modesty. Rediscovered in 2004 and restored to its full corruptive allure the uncut version of Baby Face allows some insight into its intended version. Gone was a man's first consuming gaze of Stanwyck the camera moving over her long legs and then only reluctantly up towards her face. Audience did see that same man's shockingly forward approach in propositioning her first by stroking her on the knee and then coming up from behind to snatch at her breasts. What they missed was the fiery Stanwyck giving as good as she got pouring hot coffee over the guilty hand and then later smashing a bottle over the man's head. They wouldn't see anything as daring as that from a woman for a while afterwards.".

	schema:headline " A Comparison of the Two Versions";
	schema:reviewBody "The first time I saw this movie I saw the version that had been released theatrically. I read that it had been severely edited but what remained was enough for it to become one of my favorite movies. When a copy of the original version was found the movie that I had already rated a 10 became even better.The original version was modified in three ways. The first form of editing is the sort we usually expect scenes are cut out. In one scene after Lily decides she is through turning tricks for her fatherpimp she wrestles with a politician who has paid for her services. In the original version he refers to her as the sweetheart of the nightshift but the part about the nightshift is snipped out for the theatrical version. In the original version she thinks she is rid of him and pours herself a beer. When he grabs her from behind and puts his hand on one of her breasts she hits him over the head with a beer bottle and then nonchalantly returns to her beer. That was cut out for the theatrical version. And then there is the scene that takes place when Lily and Chico hop a freight to get to New York. A guard threatens to throw them off but Lily has sex with him in exchange for letting them stay aboard. That was eliminated in the theatrical version. There are many other bits and pieces edited out too numerous to mention. In general what we easily suspect or infer of a sexual nature in the theatrical version was made a little more explicit in the original.The second form of editing consists of added scenes that were never filmed originally. In the original version Lily rides in the ambulance with her husband after his attempted suicide. Even though they will have to spend all the money they have to keep him from being convicted for malversation they look at each other fondly knowing that even without that money they will live happily together at which point the movie ends. In the theatrical version the part where they look at each other with love in their eyes is edited out. What follows is a scene in which Lily is punished by having her return to Pittsburg where she started with her husband going to work as a laborer in a steel mill forcing her to live amongst the lowlifes she wanted to get away from.The third form of editing was that of changing the words of Cragg the German cobbler who is Lily's mentor. In the first scene in which Cragg and Lily are together in the speakeasy her father owns he asks her if she read the book he lent her. In the original version we find out that the book was written by Nietzsche who Cragg says is the greatest philosopher that ever lived. In the theatrical version that line is suppressed so we don't know who wrote the book.After her father dies she visits Cragg at his shop. He tells her she must leave the town they are in or she is lost that with her youth and looks she has power over men that she can be a master not a slave. In the original version he quotes from The Will to Power in which Nietzsche says that no matter how we idealize it life is nothing but exploitation. He tells her to exploit herself to use men to get the things she wants. In the theatrical version however we do not see the title of the book or get the quote from Nietzsche. Cragg's remarks about Lily's exploiting herself and using men are removed and are replaced by something quite different he tells her to be clean and to remember the difference between right and wrong.Along the lines of suppressing Nietzsche and modifying Cragg's advice the other forms of editing are also used. In the original version Lily comes home to her swanky apartment in New York to find that Cragg has sent her another book by Nietzsche Thoughts Out of Season. She turns to a passage emphasized by Cragg in which Nietzsche says that to get what you want you must crush all sentiment. In the theatrical version we do not get to see the title of the book or its author. Inside the book is a letter from Cragg telling her she has picked the wrong way that life will defeat her unless she regains her selfrespect. And just to give Cragg's advice the proper religious tone the closing just above his name says Merry Christmas.As noted above I saw the theatrical version first. I had read that a lot of the Nietzsche stuff had been suppressed. Nevertheless I wasn't surprised by what I saw. Apologists for Nietzsche are often at pains to say that he has been misunderstood. The movie Rope 1948 is a good example. In that movie a college professor halfseriously talks about the superman who is so superior he has the right to eliminate those who are inferior.

	onyx:emotionText "The first time I saw this movie I saw the version that had been released theatrically. I read that it had been severely edited but what remained was enough for it to become one of my favorite movies. When a copy of the original version was found the movie that I had already rated a 10 became even better.The original version was modified in three ways. The first form of editing is the sort we usually expect scenes are cut out. In one scene after Lily decides she is through turning tricks for her fatherpimp she wrestles with a politician who has paid for her services. In the original version he refers to her as the sweetheart of the nightshift but the part about the nightshift is snipped out for the theatrical version. In the original version she thinks she is rid of him and pours herself a beer. When he grabs her from behind and puts his hand on one of her breasts she hits him over the head with a beer bottle and then nonchalantly returns to her beer. That was cut out for the theatrical version. And then there is the scene that takes place when Lily and Chico hop a freight to get to New York. A guard threatens to throw them off but Lily has sex with him in exchange for letting them stay aboard. That was eliminated in the theatrical version. There are many other bits and pieces edited out too numerous to mention. In general what we easily suspect or infer of a sexual nature in the theatrical version was made a little more explicit in the original.The second form of editing consists of added scenes that were never filmed originally. In the original version Lily rides in the ambulance with her husband after his attempted suicide. Even though they will have to spend all the money they have to keep him from being convicted for malversation they look at each other fondly knowing that even without that money they will live happily together at which point the movie ends. In the theatrical version the part where they look at each other with love in their eyes is edited out. What follows is a scene in which Lily is punished by having her return to Pittsburg where she started with her husband going to work as a laborer in a steel mill forcing her to live amongst the lowlifes she wanted to get away from.The third form of editing was that of changing the words of Cragg the German cobbler who is Lily's mentor. In the first scene in which Cragg and Lily are together in the speakeasy her father owns he asks her if she read the book he lent her. In the original version we find out that the book was written by Nietzsche who Cragg says is the greatest philosopher that ever lived. In the theatrical version that line is suppressed so we don't know who wrote the book.After her father dies she visits Cragg at his shop. He tells her she must leave the town they are in or she is lost that with her youth and looks she has power over men that she can be a master not a slave. In the original version he quotes from The Will to Power in which Nietzsche says that no matter how we idealize it life is nothing but exploitation. He tells her to exploit herself to use men to get the things she wants. In the theatrical version however we do not see the title of the book or get the quote from Nietzsche. Cragg's remarks about Lily's exploiting herself and using men are removed and are replaced by something quite different he tells her to be clean and to remember the difference between right and wrong.Along the lines of suppressing Nietzsche and modifying Cragg's advice the other forms of editing are also used. In the original version Lily comes home to her swanky apartment in New York to find that Cragg has sent her another book by Nietzsche Thoughts Out of Season. She turns to a passage emphasized by Cragg in which Nietzsche says that to get what you want you must crush all sentiment. In the theatrical version we do not get to see the title of the book or its author. Inside the book is a letter from Cragg telling her she has picked the wrong way that life will defeat her unless she regains her selfrespect. And just to give Cragg's advice the proper religious tone the closing just above his name says Merry Christmas.As noted above I saw the theatrical version first. I had read that a lot of the Nietzsche stuff had been suppressed. Nevertheless I wasn't surprised by what I saw. Apologists for Nietzsche are often at pains to say that he has been misunderstood. The movie Rope 1948 is a good example. In that movie a college professor halfseriously talks about the superman who is so superior he has the right to eliminate those who are inferior. When a couple of his students decide to eliminate an inferior acquaintance by murdering him the professor is appalled that they misunderstood what he was saying. So I figured Baby Face was in that tradition. The fact that in the original version Lily did not misunderstand Nietzsche as explained to her by Cragg makes this modification the most radical way in which the movie had been edited for theatrical release.Although this has the flavor of Nietzsche I have not been able to find that quotation in The Will to Power.As with the other quotation I have not been able to find this one in Thoughts Out of Season.";

	schema:reviewBody "Despite the cutesy title and the chipper music this is definitely not your Frank Capra  Columbia Studios Barbara Stanwyck. This is Warner Bros. Pictures the juvenile delinquents of Hollywood. They were the rebels who broke the rules and liked to make pictures about rebels breaking the rules such as Rebel Without a Cause. This is an early example of the studio's inclination to film noir seen later in Humphrey Bogart films like The Maltese Falcon.In Baby Face Warner Bros. breaks every rule in the book with abandon and even a sort of glee that must have driven the religious conservatives of the day into a frenzy. Not the pretend hypocritical outrage you get today but a face turning red temple pounding outrage. How else would you describe a movie where a woman sleeps with her boss and gets promoted higher and higher and even drives her filthy rich lovers to a murder suicide and still gets rewarded with even more riches? Try outrageous. Try adding up how many men Lily slept with. Better yet is there anyone she didn't sleep with?While it is all too easy to blame Stanwyck's character Lily Powers it should be kept in mind that it was the men who were using her or at least thought they were. But Lily was the more successful at the exploitation game. It was the men who were selfdeluded into thinking they were in love. They were all fools in the hands of Lily though some were richer and more sophisticated fools. Seduction by the way was not what Nietzsche's philosophy was primarily about though he was interested in the many permutations of the will and the quest for power including selfmastery. In the Christian universe he or she who commits sin will be punished by God. But not in this movie which created a problem for Christians who sometimes have trouble distinguishing film from reality. So Baby Face was censored some scenes deleted and a moral ending added. Actually I think it is a good fitting ending. But the truth is in the real world there are plenty of women who take the money and run. And they are not struck by lightning. Some even become celebrities.I can see how some viewers might miss the significance of this movie. It took me more than one viewing over the years to fully appreciate how radical it is. For young people I suppose this looks tame. For someone who is older and used to seeing old black and white movies they also might take it for granted probably having seen it on late night television years before.If you just view Baby Face casually the relative crude 1933 technical limitations on quality some stiff male acting and odd makeup on some of the men that looks like it is out of the silent era might fool you into thinking it is a B movie. It is anything but. Stanwyck's acting is superb. This is a classic.Speaking of awkward actors look for a young John Wayne with strange makeup get the brush off from Stanwyck who I imagine wouldn't even give the time of day to Wayne off the set too. He was a bit player who made 11 movies in 1933. Yet he still got billing above Theresa Harris.Harris who plays Stanwyck's black friend and maid never does the mammy routine which must have driven the conservatives nuts in 1933. But then this was Warner Bros. Sadly looking at her credits she played a lot of maids over the years including a fine performance in Miracle on 34th Street but at least here she gets to do it with class and even gets to do some fine singing. This being The Great Depression some film studios were on the ropes financially. It is well known that Capra's It Happened One Night saved Columbia Studios from possible bankruptcy. I have read that Warner Bros. also was having troubles in 1933. They may have been looking for a blockbuster in Baby Face. I imagine Baby Face must have gotten people talking and probably provided the studio with a lot of free publicity. During the Great Depression many women must have related to Lily the way they were often exploited by men and the temptation to exploit them back for all it was worth. I pulled up the original review in the New York Times and it avoided almost all comment and just summarized the plot even giving away the ending which seems quite odd as though the subject matter was too hot to handle. The devices used in the opening credits remind me of International House also made around this time and also a pretty risqu film. Not until 1959 with the release of Some Like it Hot would the Hays Code finally be abandoned and films like Baby Face be made again.".

And I was lucky enough to see the original and uncensored movie with the extra 4 minutes of additional footage. Too bad the movie is so short. Lily is a young woman barely holding it together working for her father in his illegal speakeasy. Her only link to anything is her good friend Chico played wonderfully by Theresa Harris. Though Chico is African American and having a white woman be best friends with a black woman back in the 30s was as controversial as the subject matter of this movie and Lily is not they have a special bond. And it is not sexual. Just 2 women stuck or shoved into a situation beyond their control. After Lily's father dies and she does not know what she will do she is told that she has the power to get out and to get what she wants. Yes it's immoral but that's the entire point of this movie. Then they had to go and ruin the last few minutes. So up until the last few minutes of the movie it's a superb film and worth watching. The lesson of the movie is still as valid today as it was back then and I'm sure will be a 100 years from now. Women it's awful what Lily does in order to get what she wants but it works.

The psychological games they play are clever and fun. Though there is clear rivalry between Charlie and Viola it is still conveyed in a light hearted and fun way without hatred or malice. It brings out a great message that differences can eventually be solved through honest communication. I find this film fun and delightful.".

I hadn't realized how much I missed Jane Fonda and how wonderful she is she was she will always be. The film in itself is just too terrible for words. A showdown between a possessive mother and a dog walker. The script is unbelievable bad and the aforementioned Jennifer Lopez is poor thing atrocious. She has the lightness of an elephant and the charm of a blank page but look at the billing...Jennifer Lopez right on top above Jane Fonda. Ridiculous isn't it? But that's what I imagine marketing people decide. What a shame. If I had been Miss Lopez I would have used my power to demand that Jane Fonda's name should appear above mine. I know I live in a fantasy world of respect and if nothing else good manners. The film may turn out to be useful as a teaching tool. To show both actresses together for a how to and how not to. I'm sure Jennifer Lopez must have been told by someone that she has to cultivate her craft. Her voice goodness! A jarring shrilling clash of tonsils and nasal sounds. Too late to play cute virginal girls. A dog walker indeed!".

And since neither of its stars has been burning up the box office latelyLopez hasn't had a big hit since The Wedding Planner and Fonda's been off the big screen for 15 yearsI can understand the appeal of a lightweight commercial vehicle. But did it have to be something THIS witless and unoriginal?MonsterinLaw's opening scenes play out the like the pilot for a bad sitcom. Within the first 20 minutes we've seen Lopez as Charlotte Charlie Cantilini handle multiple oddjobs including dogwalker isn't THAT quirky toured her moviesetfunky apartment and met her obligatory offbeat friends including yes the gay neighbor who enters her place without knocking. And just when it seems impossible for screenwriter Anya Kochoff to stack the clichs any higher Charlie has not one not two but three Meet Cutes with hunky doctor Kevin Fields Michael Vartan.True love blooms Kevin proposes Charlie accepts.Enter Fonda as Kevin's mother Viola a TV interviewer think Barbara Walters on steroids with problems of her ownin her first two scenes she loses her job and has an oncamera meltdown while interviewing a Britney Spearsish pop star. Presumably this is to make Viola a tad sympathetic a mother who has nothing going for her except her son which makes her all the more neurotic at the prospect of losing him.But even by comedy standards it takes a huge suspension of disbelief to think Viola's career is overif Geraldo Rivera can work at network after network after all his gaffes is there any doubt Viola would have a raft of job offers heading her way? And if Viola simply can't handle her son sharing his life with another woman why does she keep trying to set him up with a catty former flame? Lest the uberWaspish Viola's campaign against Charlie be interpreted as racism the filmmakers have cast Wanda Sykes as her assistantconfidante.The movie clunks and thumps from one comic set piece to the next punctuated by a hamhanded score by David Newman which underscores every punchline and hijink with cues more suitable for a Bugs Bunny cartoon. Vartan does what little he can with the film's most thankless role but Kochoff's script makes Kevin little more than a MacGuffin with abs a device to get the plot rolling and nothing else. By the end of the film Kevin seems so utterly clueless it's a wonder either of the women in his life want anything to do with him. Sykes fares a bit betterunlike Vartan her character at least has an inkling of what's going on.The leading ladies certainly seem like good sportsFonda plops her face into a plate of tripe Lopez makes a joke about her muchdiscussed derriereand every so often they display enough star power to make us believe they're playing characters and not caricatures.

	schema:reviewBody "As a fan of Jane Fonda's acting I was mildly interested in seeing this movie her first in many years. I wish now that I hadn't wasted my time.Granted Jane Fonda is an asset to MonsterinLaw. She brims with radiance and plays the Viola role with tremendous flair although the psychosis of her character sometimes seems forced and exaggerated. My favorite scene actually is when she flies off the handle and tries to strangle a young singer whom she is interviewing on her talk show. There are a few moments where she effectively conveys the insecurity and desperation beneath Viola's nasty exterior. Nonetheless even a brilliant actress cannot save a movie with such a weak script.Take for instance the first few scenes when Charlie and Kevin meet in a most whimsical fashion may I add. This introduction seems too drawnout and ultimately worthless to the plot. I found myself mentally tuning out for the sake of my sanity.Speaking of the two lovers I'd be hardpressed to name a more boring onscreen couple. JLo as has been mentioned frequently on this site comes across as too sweet and innocent and perfect throughout most of the movie. Simply put she's annoying. I kept wishing they could have cast a more watchable actress. The Kevin character also has zero substance and is bland. He is like a prop that they casually drag into the movie whenever they need some filler between CharlieViola catfights.Wanda Sykes as Viola's assistant is fairly comical and works much better with Jane Fonda than JLo does. Viola's motherinlaw also delivers her lines in an entertainingly caustic way. However these two women do not have much screen time at all.MonsterinLaw progresses as a string of loosely connected arguments. The result is tedious and mundane. There is no climax really. If you've seen one spat between Charlie and Viola you've seen them all. They spew petty insults...they seek revenge on each other...they go on to the next scene and repeat it all over again. It might be juicy if it weren't so repetitive and if a different actress were squaring off against Jane Fonda and if the dialogue weren't quite so stale.The ending is literally an embarrassment. Oh I won't give it away...except to say that I felt as if I were watching the end of a Full House episode. Yes folks the music and lines are THAT corny and predictable. By the way this is not a central plot point by any means but Charlie's bridal gown is not particularly flattering. More like flattening. It makes her look as if she has no chest at all! Anyhow I would not recommend this fluffy somewhat empty movie which hardly evoked a laugh or even a smile from me. If you still want to see it go ahead but definitely don't expect too much. I saw this movie just a couple of hours ago and have already forgotten about most of it. Not that I'm complaining.".

	schema:reviewBody "MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS Okay so right off the bat I have to say that Monster In Law is bad. It's really dumb clich ridden and common. It's not Showgirls bad but it is mediocre and I think I've had quite enough of mediocrity. I know many of you out there might be saying well what do you expect Citizen Kane. Well yes I do. At least the Citizen Kane of modern romantic comedies. Hell I'll take an attempt at something unique or original but to be honest I'm sick of settling and forgiving these films for their lack of creativity just because these movies are charming. Set in the near future a space alien steals the DNA ofjust kidding. Monster in Law is the story of the nicest girl ON THE PLANET Jennifer Lopez who meets the perfect man Michael Vartan. When I say perfect I mean the dude is perfect he's a surgeon you see and every time someone on his operating table dies he yells Itjust doesn't get any easier!!! No I'm kidding again. He is a surgeon yes but he's perfect so no one dies. Anyway nicest girl perfect man want to get married. Enter perfect man's mom Jane Fonda. JaFo doesn't want MiVa to marry J.Lo. I wasn't quite sure of the reason why. I think it had to do with some sort socialite caste system. See Jenny From The Block is merely a tempdog walker and Hanoi Jane is a rich T.V talk personality who drops names like a seagull at a statue. So obviously Lopez isn't good enough for VaughnI mean Vartan.Over the course of the movies 90 minute running time you will be subjected to the following Conspiracies to derail the wedding. The Clinging Mother who feigns anxiety attacks. The Dogs attacking PradaGucciFendi gag. The sleeping pill resulting in the face intheworldsworstfooddish joke. And if orange is the new black allergy flareups in romantic comedies must be the new fart joke. Oh and just when you think they couldn't possibly go there the words You win the wedding's off actually are spoken thus giving us all the required romcom conflict clichs.There is something that I must concede. Wanda Sykes not only steals this movie from its two stars but she is so good that I would pay money to see her do it again rental people rental. She is hilarious as Fonda's caustic quickwitted assistant. Sykes has made a career out of playing the sidekick and all her training has paid of beautifully. No one could've delivered the line I think I dislocated my vagina as well as Sykes. She is the reason you won't ask for your money back at the end of Monster In Law. Sykes aside Monster in Law has remained faithful to the unoriginal formula Hollywood has been recently churning out. I for one am done forgiving talented people for being just good enough. You hear me Keanu! You make too much God Damned money to suck as often as you do. The same goes for Fonda and Lopez. Vartan gets a pass cause he's new.".

A beautiful woman and gifted actress the motion picture camera has been an unflinching repository for her acting genius. Even in her lesser films Fonda always revealed a spark of creativity that often distinguished her from most of her acting contemporaries. With 6 Academy Award nominations to her credit and 2 Oscar wins for Best Actress her legacy is firmly established. How sad it is then to report that her return to the screen after a 15 year hiatus is squandered on a wretchedly written clumsily directed romantic comedy that is an embarrassment for not only Fonda but a talented supporting cast.MonsterinLaw represents what seems to be an increasingly generic brand of comedy. Gone are the days of sharply observant romantic entertainments when writers knew where to throw in a bit of farce or add a dollop of cynicism. Directors such as Billy Wilder and Preston Sturges along with writers I.A.L. Diamond and Fay and Michael Kanin knew how to put an effective story together even if in hindsight the plausibility of the tale was suspect. Most contemporary movies are a completely different animal. Character motivation and good storytelling have been replaced by gross caricature and connectthedots formulaic writing that is as predictable as it is depressing.MonsterinLaw takes many of its cues from an earlier Fonda comedy the lamentable 1981 burlesque 9 to 5. In that film three beleaguered secretaries wreak havoc on their sexist boss. The story was treated as pure farce and was marginally entertaining at best. There have been a score of dumbeddown comedies since. Unfortunately movie audiences seem easily pleased by this new comedy hybrid.In MonsterinLaw Jane Fonda plays veteran television interviewer Viola Fields a Diva from Hell who is determined to break up the impending marriage of her handsome vacuous son an L.A. surgeon to Charlotte Charlie Cantilini Jennifer Lopez an office temp part time caterer and dog walker. What starts out as only a mere semblance to reality quickly deteriorates into the most puerile farce imaginable soon after Viola makes her entrance. Viola is a psychotic mixture of brass balls and vulnerability and Ms. Fonda plays her to the hilt. Her star wattage is undeniable but this is not a particularly good performance. Most of the fault lies with Anya Kocheff's execrable screenplay and Robert Luketic's sledgehammer direction. Rationality is thrown out the window for the witless line and easy laugh. Only Wanda Sykes emerges relatively unscathed playing Viola's sarcastic assistant. Her Ruby is the one genuinely funny character in the movie. Otherwise MonsterinLaw is a mess and possibly the worst movie of Jane Fonda's career.".

Thing are going well until she meets his overbearing mother Jane Fonda a recently fired news anchorwoman who takes her aggression out on her son's new girlfriend with help from her assistant Ruby Wanda Sykes. But Charlotte is ready to fight back.The premise is rather old and it has been done to death recently. Shrek 2 Meet the Fockers Guess Who and now this film. I still enjoy this type of comedy but this is the worse one of the previous four. However MonsterinLaw is still an enjoyable movie. It doesn't offer anything memorable but it's pretty entertaining while it lasts. I'll admit the movie is highly unrealistic from the cruel stuff Fonda and Lopez do to each other to the nice home Lopez owns despite the fact that it looks way too expensive for her to own. Some of the cruel things they do to each other is pretty funny while other times it's just a bit too much. Luckily there really isn't too much of this material since the movie is only 100 minutes long. So the film hardly gets boring and it ends before it wears out its welcome.The acting is alright with a few performances really saving the movie. Jane Fonda gives a really funny performance as Charlotte. She does go over the top but her performance is still a lot of fun to watch on screen. Jennifer Lopez gives a bland performance nothing special. Her chemistry with Fonda is weak and their scenes aren't as good as they could have been. Wanda Sykes offers a funny performance as Ruby. Her scenes with Jane Fonda are the best things about the movie though she gets a little annoying. Michael Vartan is kind of just there and he doesn't really do anything special.Robert Luketic directs and he does an okay job. He could have made the film a little more realistic and a little less sitcomish but the movie turned out okay. The audience I saw this with were really into it and they seemed to be enjoying themselves. Obviously critics won't like this film but those looking for a nice comedy should check out this movie. It is a little mean spirited and predictable but this doesn't take away too much from the movie. In the end MonsterinLaw is a good time passer nothing more or less. Rating 710".

	schema:reviewBody "How Lo can you go?Cinemas in the Algarve region of Portugal have retained the custom of inserting an interval during the main feature. This is slightly annoying at times but at others it provides a welcome break  time for a quick smoke and time to decide whether there is any point going back to see the second half of the film. The break is thus a wonderful opportunity to slip away quietly without having to climb all over the other members of the audience midway through the film.Sadly I saw MonsterinLaw in Lisbon where there was no such luxury so I was forced to sit through the entire nine hours. OK 90 minutes but didn't Einstein say something about relativity Admittedly the film poster itself had sent up enough warning signals to discourage the floating viewer in the same way as you can be sure that any film starring Keanu Reeves will be drivel you can count on anything featuring JLo being suspect at best. However I have always found Wanda Sykes very funny and Jane Fonda is usually worth a look.Within 10 minutes I was wishing I'd gone to see Crash instead. Or anything. Or a blank wall.The scene is quickly set. JLo is the perfect if a little quirky woman looking for the perfect man. Her friends  the obligatory gay man and slightly trashy girl  assure her that he is out there somewhere. Sure enough he appears in the form of a perfect surgeon with a perfect physique perfect teeth and perfect designer stubble ... Unfortunately his mother Jane Fonda is a perfect harridan fresh off the back of a nervous breakdown  or so we are asked to believe.This is where the fun should start with the general idea I guess being to make an allchick version of Meet the Parents. Why? Good question and one to which I am still seeking an answer.The plot such as it is is transparently thin  there cannot surely be anyone with an IQ higher than their shoe size who could not have predicted the ending right down to the script before the opening credits were over.The only element of interest that remained was to see what the cast could do within the framework they had been given. Not a lot it seems. But to be fair Trevor Nunn and the Royal Shakespeare Company couldn't have done anything with this turkey.The film limps from scene to scene with no sense of continuity or purpose the only objective seems to be to reach the grand finale which still manages to disappoint.Questions must be asked. Why did Jane Fonda end a 15year break from the big screen to star in this nightmare? Did she lose a bet? In the same veinwhy would Wanda Sykes debase her obvious talent to take on this quasiUncle Tom role? True she was about the only person worth watching in the entire debacle but she deserves a better vehicle than this.Sadly JLo looked at home here seeming very much at ease in an overhyped production with no substance at all. Michael Vartan the perfect man manages to get away moreorless unscathed but only because his role is so peripheral that you can easily forget that he's there. I have a nagging suspicion that this film may not appear too prominently on his CV.As far as I can see this is Anya Kochoff's first foray into the world of screen writing. May it be her last. Please.".

I would actually say that such a title deserved a better movie.'Monster in Law' is a combination between 'Maid in Manhattan' and 'Meet the Parents'. Jennifer Lopez is practically redoing her role in 'Maid ..' and this is probably what she knows to play best or the only thing she knows to play I do not know. The problem is that this movie is made three years later and the character is supposed to be ten years younger than in the New York located film. I also suspect that she cannot count on her looks for long and even here a couple of jokes about her waist had to be inserted. What will she do with her career in the next years? Well we'll see.Robert Luketic directed the original 'Legally Blonde' and had much better material to work from there. The main problem of this film is that the script is so predictable the jokes so thin and we must have seen the end in zillions of other movies. We do have Jane Fonda back on screen but sincerely I would expect her to do something else after 15 years of creativity break and not this routine feel good comedy.I am afraid that this film  after making its inflight entertainment career  will rest soon on the shelves of the studios full of notsofunny comedies and a well deserved amount of dust will cover it. Twenty years from now somebody will maybe take the idea and the title and make a better film of it.".

Jane Fonda returns to the screen after a fifteen year absence and plays a successful talk show host who is replaced by a younger woman. This has a bad affect on her sanity until her son arrives home with his girlfriend and announces their engagement. From there Fonda tries to sabotage the relationship until his fianc retaliates. Typical setup follows formula faithfully until arriving exactly where we expect it too. Directed by Robert Luketic who previously made the underrated Win a Date With Tad Hamilton as well as the overrated Legally Blonde. Fonda is a welcome sight as she aids her frustration with alcohol and Lopez plays a worthy target for her rage but they are reduced to a back and forth battle where one struggles to out scheme the other. Supporting roles unfortunately do not measure up. Michael Vartan as Fonda's son is flat. He is basically a prop that shakes his finger in their faces in the conclusion then telling them to kiss and make up. Wanda Sykes as Fonda's adviser has the best lines but the role is flat and uninteresting. Theme addresses close ties of parents and the inability to accept change within relationships in fear of losing touch. To bad someone didn't lose the script. Score 6  10".

	schema:reviewBody "Jane Fonda is back after 15 years of not making any movies and she gives a very good performance as the titular character in MotherinLaw. A romantic comedy directed by Robert Luketic Legally Blonde and Win a Date with Tad Hamilton and written by first timer Anya Kochoff the movie gets very good to OK performances by the actors and there are some funny parts but overall it fails and is only being talked about because Miss Barbarella is back on the big screen. Jennifer Lopez plays Charlie a dogwalker among several other jobs and super nice girl who falls for Michael Vartan's Kevin Fields a super nice guy who happens to be a very rich surgeon. After their first date the movie jumps 2 months in the future and their moving in together and right away Kevin takes Charlie to meet his mom a super crazy TV show host who got fired for a younger girl and had to go to a psychiatric facility for a while but is now back home. Jane Fonda plays Viola Fields perfectly getting all crazy for nothing or sometimes justified like when Kevin proposes to Charlie in front of her on their first meeting. From there on is up to Viola to stop the wedding at any cost and turn Charlie crazy so they don't get married because she doesn't deserves him since she's way down in the class system. Fonda is good though annoying at times Jennifer Lopez is OK though not as good as in her previous comedies probably because the story is kind of split between her and Fonda so they both got lots of screen time. Michael Vartan is only there to smile and tell them he loves them. The rest of the supporting characters are better than the leads with Wanda Sykes stealing the show as Ruby Viola's personal assistant. And yes she steals the show but I feel that she's still wasted in the movie. We all know Wanda is one of the funniest comedians these days but all she does here is deliver one liners every ten minutes or say shit whenever something over the top happened. It's sad but she reminded me of the black guy explaining why was he in there in Not Another Teen Movie. Same here Wanda was the token black woman. Also supporting and kind of funny were Adam Scott and Annie Parisse as Charlie's gay friend Remi and best girlfriend Morgan respectively and totally wasted and with only 2 or 3 lines was Will Arnet as Kevin's best friend Kit. Jane Fonda is back and I couldn't care less specially if she's going to keep doing movies like this that are funny because of its supporting players but that overall have nothing memorable about them and are impossible to recommend. Still props to the producers for not going into a lower level getting Jennifer Lopez's hubby Marc Anthony a part which would've make this the biggest piece of crap ever.".

It was just so...not funny. The story was...that there was none. There were many errors with this movie 1 The relationship between Charlie and Kevin was so rushed and unbelievable. Neither of them seemed to have any faults what so ever. This is totally not realistic. The character Kevin was a rich sweet doctor. Sickeningly perfect... Charlie too seemed to have no real issues except that she wasn't rich but who the hell cares anyway? 2 Jane Fonda's character although entertaining at times was also unrealistic. She was a total b to Charlie the whole time and for no apparent reason except that she is losing her son. Oh cry me a river. And honestly how could she not realize that what she was doing was exactly what her motherinlaw had done to her? And she called Charlie a trampslut half the time and she had been married four times. I just felt no sympathy for her whatsoever. That's what a movie is supposed to do. Unless there is an evil character I think they are supposed to make you sympathize with all the characters but I just didn't feel that for her. 3 The situations between Viola and Charlie were just...stupid. Not funny stupid. And they just seemed to get more mean each time. I didn't like that message that it sent that Mother'sinlaw are like that. It was just...ugh. 4 The ending was so hokey. I mean seriously. C You Win. R You no you were worse than your motherinlaw V Oh my freaking god I have! I'm so sorry you should marry him I was just scared and stupid. C Fine but you have to be with us and your grandkids all the time then. V Oh OK but make sure they call me Aunt instead of Grandma...'cause I'm a freak. rolls eyes Puhleez!I gave this movie two stars because there were a couple funny scenes with Jane Fonda and Wanda Sykes.

	schema:reviewBody "In this haunting work by Vittoria De Sica an aristocratic ItalianJewish family the FinziContinis serve as a symbol of European civilization in the hands of the brown shirts on the eve of World War II.  Seeing it again after thirty years I find myself saddened almost as much by the story of a stillborn unrequited love as I am by the horror of the cattle cars to come.Dominique Sanda with her large soft eyes is mesmerizing as the beautiful enigmatic but icy Micol FinziContini.  Giorgio Lino Capolicchio is her childhood friend a boy from a middleclass Jewish family now grown up. He's in love with her but her feelings for him are that of a sister.  He is confused by her warmth and then as he tries to get close her cool rejection.  It has often been expressed metaphorically that Europe in the thirties was raped by fascism.  However in this extremely disturbing film De Sica is saying that it wasn't a rape that the aristocracy of Europe here represented by the FinziContinis of Ferrara and in particular by the young and beautiful Micol was a willing even an eager participant in the bestial conjoining.The Garden of the FinziContinis is far from perfect some would say it is also far from De Sica's best work.  Certainly it comes after his prime.  The editing is a little too severe in places while some of the scenes are too loosely focused.  Nonetheless this is an enormously powerful film that finds its climax in one of the most disturbing scenes in all of cinema.  There is little point in discussing this film without looking at this scene. Consequently for those of you who have not seen the film and do not want to risk having it spoiled for you you should stop reading now and come back afterwards.Everything in the movie works toward setting up the cabana scene.  We see the dog several times hinting at a crude animalistic side to Micol.  And there is the wall that separates the FinziContini's garden of civilization from the brown shirts in the streets a wall that also separates the rich from other people particularly from the middle class who support the fascists as we are told in the opening scene.  We see Micol leading Giorgio by the hand about the estate but always when he tries to caress her she pulls away.  Finally she explains to him why she doesn't love him. She says lovers want to overwhelm each other...but...we are as alike as two drops of water...how could we overwhelm and want to tear each other...it would be like making love with a brother...  But hearing these words is not enough.  Giorgio goes to the wall one last time sees a red bicycle there red and black were the colors of the Nazi party and knows that Micol is with someone else.  He climbs the wall and finds the dog outside the cabana so that he knows she is within.  In the opening scene she referred to the cabana with the German Htte adding that now we'll all have to learn German.  What he sees when he looks through the window fills him with a kind of stupefying horror as it does us.   Not a word is spoken.  He sees her he sees who she is with and what the circumstances are.  She sees him turns on the light so that there can be no mistake and they stare wordlessly at one another.  She projects not shame but a sense of This is who I am. I would say I'm sorry but it wouldn't change anything.  This is what I'm drawn to.What is expressed in this essentially symbolic scene acted out in sexual terms is what happened to Europe.  Micol is at once the love he wanted so much deflowered by an anonymous but clearly fascist man and she is also the aristocracy of Europe polluted by fascism.I wonder if it is just a coincidence that the famous poem by Robert Browning My Last Duchess is also set in Ferrara.  In that poem the narrator reveals himself through the unfeeling brutality of his speech and actions to be although an aristocrat an incipient fascist.  I also wonder if De Sica is saying that the Jews in some sense contributed to the horror that befell them and by extension all of humanity.  We see this expressed in the person of Giorgio's father who continually insists that it's not that bad yet as step by step they lose their status as citizens a prelude to the dehumanization that is the precursor of genocide.  Certainly the closing scenes in which the Jews of Italy are seen to be compliant as they are led to the slaughter suggests as much.  I know that the central feeling expressed by Jews after the war and especially in Israel was simply never again.  Nevertheless there is a certain sense of the inevitable about this film that I find particularly disturbing.  Passivity in sexual terms a giving in to one's nature is one thing.  A passivity in political terms is quite another and yet it is part of the power of this film to show us how they are related in our psyches.".

	schema:reviewBody "In THE GARDEN OF THE FINZICONTINIS  based on the autobiographical novel by Giorgio Bassani  legendary Neorealist filmmaker Vittorio de Sica dramatizes the human cost of the racial laws' gradually implemented against the Jews in Fascist Italy during the years 193843. The more Bassani's young middleclass Jewish protagonist feels the brunt of Mussolini's antiSemitic edicts encroaching upon him the more he feels drawn to the aristocratic Jewish FinziContinis' estate  their Edenic garden  and to Micl the family's beautiful young daughter. Psychologically this compulsion seems to stem from a deep emotional attachment to a perpetually innocent untroubled state of childhood which both Micl and her garden seem to represent. Throughout the film there is a marked conflict between childhood and adulthood between the distant past and the immediate present between the act of retreating into a world of comfortable illusions and confronting a world of harsh and bitter realities.I found this particular aspect of the story very fascinating although too tantalizingly obscure and openended  and thus not quite as illuminating or fulfilling as it might have been were it more clearly explained. This could the reason why some people find the film  and its heavily symbolic impressionistic style  a little confusing and underwhelming.For Giorgio  both the naive hero and wisened author of the story  Micl embodies the mystery and allure of the FinziContinis as well as their insularity and their apparent passivity in the face of the escalating Fascist crackdown. She always appears distant and unattainable with no obvious reasons for her actions and never really provides a direct comprehensible explanation for her insistent rejection of Giorgio or for what appears to be a subtle streak of cruelty towards him. Her conversation with him always seems deliberately vague and her refusal to make any further connection with him has a curious almost perverse kind of fatalism about it. Again this is another feature of the film that is certainly intriguing  and strangely seductive  but alas never quite pays off enough to become fully understandable to either the protagonist or the audience.  When the Fascists finally do arrest the FinziContinis and confiscate their estate it comes as something of a surprise. The muted and deliberately spare representation of these characters and their feelings as evidenced in their unusually restrained behavior is meant to isolate and heighten the impact of a few devastating strokes of sudden realization and lucidity  pointed indications that the protective spell of the FinziContinis has been finally broken.All in all wellacted and gorgeously languidly poetic in its imagery...yet narrativewise the picture seems overly elliptical and ultimately opaque  and leaves just a few too many rough fragments and loose ends lingering at the end of the story not quite Proustian irony maybe?. In spite of this peculiar drawback the film finishes very effectively and by the final desolate shots you are left with an unexpectedly intense feeling of loss and anguish.  It is important to note however that the last scene  in which Giorgio's father meets the FinziContinis in a detention center  is fictitious and does not appear in the novel and Bassani had a falling out with de Sica about this.".

In spite of this peculiar drawback the film finishes very effectively and by the final desolate shots you are left with an unexpectedly intense feeling of loss and anguish.  It is important to note however that the last scene  in which Giorgio's father meets the FinziContinis in a detention center  is fictitious and does not appear in the novel and Bassani had a falling out with de Sica about this.";

	schema:reviewBody "This was probably Vittorio DeSica's last excellent film before his death in 1974 and it took me about 20 years to view it a second time. I certainly understand it more this time than the first time I viewed it. Story is set in the late 1930's in Ferrara Italy with the impending war looming on the horizon. The family of the FinziContinis are rich and Jewish and live in a huge manor behind locked gates and they love to have friends over for picnics and tennis. One of the friends is Giorgio Lino Capolicchio and he is in love with Micol FinziContini Dominique Sanda and they have known each other since they both were kids but Micol does not love Giorgio. He's persistent in his affections but Micol lives in an isolated world hidden behind the gates and her demeanor is very cold and malicious. Meanwhile Giorgio's father Romolo Valle seems to be oblivious to what is happening in the world and utters It's not that bad. Mussolini has enacted laws that forbid Jews from going to school entering the library and other restrictions. One night Giorgio discovers Micol having an affair with his more Fascist friend Bruno Fabio Testi and Micol notices him in the window but seems not to care. SPOILER ALERTWhile DeSica somewhat abandoned his neorealism approach later in his career this does have an aura of those wonderful films like The Bicycle Thief and Umberto D. DeSica still wanted to show the world what it was like in Italy during the darker times and even though he had a larger budget and professional actors in his films his attitude never really shifted. This film is primarily about the two lead characters played by Capolicchio and Sanda. Even with war upon them they both seemed to be in their own world. Giorgio became a very angry and heartbroken man and even with soldiers walking around his city he seemed to only care about Micol's rejection of him. But late in the film he did snap out of it and escaped. He didn't allow what happened to him to get the better of him. Unfortunately Micol and her family waited too long and were rounded up to be sent to camps. There are instances in this film that I thought Micol was awaiting to be taken by the Fascists and Nazi's. It's one of the reasons she slept with Bruno and seemed unperturbed by the events around her. Remember what Giorgio's father told him? He said In life in order to understand to really understand the world you must die at least once. So it's better to die young when there's still time left to recover and live again. After viewing this thought provoking film once again maybe DeSica was showing us that Micol needed to get out of her haven and understand the world about her.".

It is the notion that though film necessarily artificializes it is possible to start with truth and deliberately enhance it cinematic ally. Because he relied on class struggle viewers mistakenly associate that with the essence of neorealism.His early work is much celebrated but as he aged and added layers and nuance his relatively simpleminded audience was lost. Here we have a later masterpiece not generally regarded as such.The basic story is of two Jewish families the impeding brutality of fellow Italians and different approaches to life and love in the knowing face of doom. At that level it has some charm and power.But what he has done is to invert all the values and superimpose them on the originals. Its a common technique in writing and found of course in the novel. We have the obvious a relatively small garden within which the inhabitants blithely create an artificial world while the real world grinds down upon them. The garden is in Europe but it is also Europe.As I say That's obvious. Also common far too common is the placement of sexual mechanics in political mechanics as if one explains the other while they cause each other. Ho Hum. But there are three other elements and these I appreciate. While he is reversing things and overlaying them he casts accordingly. The European fiction was that Jews were dark earthy people. Hairy monetary shrewd animal. Yet the actors who play the Jews are according to cinematic conventions of Aryans light haired light skinned svelte. Their manner is similarly cinematic and the Nazifascist movement was inherently cinematic completely unconcerned about money and politics and instead concerned about poetry and idleness. Roles reversed we know this for certain when the Jewish girl tells her nonJewish suitor he is not her type too communist and too hairy.There's another explicit inversion the thing is a movie but the anchor of reality within it is well movies. Three times. Plus our hero goes from Passover at his house where the family is singing something vapid to the FinziContinis where they are doing something movielike looking into a glass to see the future.Third we know this is not straighton narrative because the camera has a habit of drifting out of the narrative frame. KarWai is the current master of this and for the same reason.Naturally underlying it all is that this is not the work of fascists or Nazis but of Italians and Germans. Not few but many essentially all. Because of that one thing I find this more powerful than Schindler's List. Sure his people were more demonstrably evil but so are all his villains in his fakey worlds. It doesn't make it real if he shows real history in the same theatrical way. No for real evil we have to see how ordinary it is.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a parable  a wakeup call to all those who feel sufficiently insulated from global pressures so that they feel immune to the effects to which most other people are subject. The FinziContinis are an aristocratic wealthy connected Jewish family in Italy in the 1930s40s. Mussolini's Fascist party followed the lead of Germany's HitlerNazis' antiSemitism and purging of Jews at first slowly following suit denying Jews library use was among the earlier then denying university graduation for Jews then forbidding marriage between Jews and nonJews then denying any possibility of nonJews working for Jews etc. etc. They increasingly tightened their antiSemitic noose.The social position of the FinziContinis and their walled garden seemed at first to keep these gathering restrictions at bay and inconsequential.

The FinziContinis are an aristocratic wealthy connected Jewish family in Italy in the 1930s40s. Mussolini's Fascist party followed the lead of Germany's HitlerNazis' antiSemitism and purging of Jews at first slowly following suit denying Jews library use was among the earlier then denying university graduation for Jews then forbidding marriage between Jews and nonJews then denying any possibility of nonJews working for Jews etc. etc. They increasingly tightened their antiSemitic noose.The social position of the FinziContinis and their walled garden seemed at first to keep these gathering restrictions at bay and inconsequential.

	schema:headline " Underrated Holocaust film by Vittorio de Sica";
	schema:reviewBody "Nostalgia is self destruction.  Adrienne Rich The Garden of the FinziContinis takes place in fascist Italy during the reign of Mussolini. World War 2 is on the horizon and already racial laws are being implemented. Italian Jews have been banned from public schools marrying non Jews phone records libraries obituaries using servants and are subject to strict curfews. Gradually the rights of Jews are eradicated even the wealthiest Jewish families reduced to third class citizens. Slowly a race is made invisible.Against this backdrop is told the story of two Jewish families the affluent and aristocratic FinziContini family and the middle class Bassani family. The FinziContinis live a cloistered existence within the confines of their palatial estate. Surrounded by tall walls and a vast garden the family lives in a dream world believing that fascism will leave their lavish lives untouched. Director Vittorio de Sica uses overexposed bleached images and white clothing to suggest that these wealthy Jews live within an almost idyllic haven. When the family hosts tennis games for friends and family de Sica shoots them like innocent forest nymphs frolicking in Eden.Of course outside the stone walls of the FinziContini estate trouble brews. The Bassani family adjusts to Mussolini's racist laws with success at first their father stating that despite their new limitations they can still live a reasonably secure existence. Their daughter will simply have to be home schooled their maid will have to be smuggled in and their son Giorgio will simply have to use the private libraries of friends. No big deal. They can adjust. Right?The widespread complacency is shocking. It's not just a question of nonJews ignoring these racist laws but of Jews accepting these laws outright for fear of rocking the boat. The Bassani's submit and the FinziContini's ignore. And even if they wanted to challenge Mussolini's racist segregation policies how would they go about doing so? During one scene in which Giorgio is kicked out of a public library de Sica makes it clear that when the world begins to collapse it's never anyone's fault. Power is fragmented and everyone is fearfully following orders obeying rules that somebody else devised. Everything is compartmentalised sectioned off and objections are funnelled through neverending mazes. To fight an organised system would take organised dissent on a vast array of fronts. And so Jews and Gentiles submit to the racist laws. The war will be over soon they hope and Italy and Germany will soon emerge victorious. Just abide and hope that things change. Right? Big mistake.The second half of the film focuses on the romance between Giorgio Bassani and Micol FinziContini. Despite Micol's wealth and beauty Giorgio loves her primarily for the sense of tranquillity she represents. He knew her during her childhood and so begins to see her as an almost nostalgic symbol. She represents a snapshot in time a personification of Europe before things went bad. Many have complained that Micol is a cipher in the film. That she prowls her estate like a zombie and that she never gives a reason for rejecting Giorgio's advances. But this is the film's very point. Micol is an idealised vision of the world simultaneously deluding herself and representative of mass denial. She is a ghost the past and Giorgio cannot attain her because she has long turned her back to the living world. This romance thus abstracts many of the themes that take place in the film. Firstly it illustrates the false belief held by both Gentiles and Jews that if they isolate themselves and mind their own business they may be spared the horrors of this hostile political climate. Secondly it shows that no amount of wealth prestige and education can defend you against mindless irrational bigotry. Finally it highlights the dangers of Jewish ethnocentricity. To many Judaism is a cultural fortresses that keeps outsiders out and insiders in the degree to which Jewish communities are isolated from their host cultures is even reflected at the genetic level. Of course one should not have to assimilate to avoid persecution but this ethnocentricity is one reason why Jewish history is one of success and growth followed by persecution and slaughter. A cycle which plays out repeatedly from the Egyptian Exodus to the Holocaust. Beyond this the the behaviour of all the film's characters echo that of German Italian and International communities who during WW2 were likewise guilty of both dangerous conformity and violent disinterest.910  Western Holocaust films have colonised our minds with a very American view of the Holocaust. They present us with false iconography freak show myths which exploit visual touchstones. But the Holocaust was not a horror movie. It unfolded with the banality of everyday life in bright colours ordinary day to day activities rarely upset. There was nothing alien about the Holocaust. The world didn't break down or erupt into violence. Instead it stood back with a serene far more chilling acceptance. Perhaps this is why today documentary footage of Hitler relaxing with his family in the Bavarian Alps is far more horrific than any of his loud mouthed speeches.See Lina Wertmller's Seven Beauties and Lajos Koltai's Fateless. Worth multiple viewings.".

	schema:headline " Certainly a very good film but not the masterpiece everyone has touted it as being 810";
	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS AHEADThere are many many movies about WWII both about the battles and about the condition of life for the people involved especially the situation of the Jews in Europe. When someone makes a movie on this latter subject it is very difficult for anyone to criticize it. 1998's Life is Beautiful received some criticism but mainly because it contained comic elements where people felt there should be only tragedy. But if the film is a drama then it is basically untouchable by critics and viewers. And as for this film itself it was directed by an old master who had been out of it for a while. Even if the film was terrible there was no way when it came out in the early 70s that anyone was going to call it less than a masterpiece an instant classic if you will.Well this film is in no way terrible. In fact it is very good. It affected me enough where I did tear up a bit. I was touched at certain points. But I also was acutely aware of some of the film's shortcomings as I watched.First off the reason why I teared up i.e. what I did like about the film especially the relationship between Georgio and Micol. I connected with it instantly because I have been through similar circumstances. It is rather painful let me tell you. I longed for Micol right along side with Georgio and  felt utterly rejected simultaneously with him. This is the way one should experience a great film. There were two more relationships that were really well developed and deeply felt by me both involving Georgio Georgio and his father a very good character played by a marvelous actor and Georgio and Malnate. The rest of the characters were very sloppily made. Did Alberto FinziContini exist for any other reason than to create that great funeral procession scene? He was barely in the movie at all. I had thought they had forgotten him for a long time then they finally came back to him and he was next to death. The FinziContini family was hardly existent. I thought the father was a butler until very near the end of the film. A cheap joke is made about the centegenarian grandmother's inability to hear well although this character had a very poignant scene at the very end of the film.Possibly the biggest problem of the film is that the scenes dealing with antiSemitism and the onset of war never really coalesced with the problems surrounding Micol's and Georgio's relationship. The latter theme dominated the film while the former only appeared in the background. This structure would have been fine but the background section of the film never seemed to influence much the foreground. Georgio could have just as easily have fallen in love with Micol without the war going on. This is not what puts stress on their relationship. Possibly the main theme that de Sica was trying to get through in the film was that our personal lives do not naturally care about what is happening in society but society keeps trying to push its way into our personal lives. Unfortunately it only works to a certain extent. The film was too short for its subject matter. It is only 94 minutes long. If it had been two hours or even two and a half the two parts would have fit together better and the main theme would have been a lot more potent. One of my very favorite films has the exact same theme The Unbearable Lightness of Being where people attempt to love each other in Czechoslovakia while the Soviets oppress them. It is three hours long and it works on every level. In The Garden of the FinziContini there is not even time for a proper conclusion. Micol's story is finished or at least as finished as it needs to be but what happened to Georgio? His father just informs us that he left. Why can't we see him leave? We don't need an enormous explanation from him but just a subtle scene as is the film's style where he packs and talks to his mother maybe. Surely he hasn't gotten Micol out of his mind that quickly. I realize it was in his best interests to get the heck out of Italy right away but I can't believe he doesn't at least think for a moment whether or not he should do something on Micol's behalf. I'm fine that he doesn't. I would bet that in the novel this sort of scene appears. It should have also been in the film. I give the film an 810 mostly for the truetolife pain it caused me concerning the onesided love.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Garden of the FinziContinis is not just a physical safe space from the pressures and evils of a world about to be plunged into a second world war but also a metaphysical memory of the mind a last enduring remnant of the prewar society where Jews were not third class citizens. De Sica obliges with his camera never revealing it in its entirety never connecting the endless towering walls of the estate to the rest of the town or constraining its limits. It has a mystical quality that doesn't seem to be defined by logical or rational size limits. The lighting is overexposed to create a dreamy utopian aura like the characters are prancing about in the Garden of Eden. The camera steals peeks from behind trees and zooms in with a slight shakiness as if we were voyeuristically intruding on this paradise. And we have a reversal too that certainly goes against the propaganda of the time and Hitler's wishes  the Jews aren't dishevelled caricatures but tall and beautiful with the blondest of locks. Micol is particularly graceful and has caught the eye of a fellow Jewish boy although they might be from different worlds altogether the way that this is portrayed. Their first meeting is as convention goes Micol peeking over the great big walls of her estate and conversing with the lowly Giorgio. This motif has been used to indicate distance before  think Romeo and Juliet  but here it is imbued with a greater purpose and sense of injustice because they are after all of the same Jewish descent. They prance about in their mansion as if not aware of this biological fact flaunting their privilege and wealth  when Jews are barred from the local tennis club they host their own because they of course have their own courts. And when Giorgio is barred from the local library he consults their vast book stores. De Sica establishes this all with a keen eye. His camera long removed from his neorealist days draws attention to itself and pieces of information that are vital. In a pivotal scene Giorgio is so lovestruck that he climbs the cabana to spy on her private affairs. He is despondent to find the aftermath of a love affair between Micol and the tall dark Bruno Malnate who was presumably too frank in his political views to ever associate with her. And what does Micol do? Not hurriedly move to cover herself but instead gazes right at Giorgio as if to force him to confront the truth of her nature and how it has been violated but willingly of course as Mussolini had done by the fascist gentleman. That pretty idealist version of her is long gone in the past made murky by the tendrils that would lead to the Holocaust. The garden remains in Giorgio's mind long after the Jews rights have been taken from them until not even his father can justify it. But it does not unfold like some nightmare that has been fetishsized for maximum horror and impact. When he is told that he cannot stay in the library he asks why and the security guard cannot give him an answer only that he is following orders. And how many soldiers have testified to that claim? On the one hand we have Schindler's List and on the other we have this  a slow systematic purge that is continually justified until it can no longer be. The children cheer because they will miss school never mind any real implications. The vile undertone of antiSemitism lurks throughout and FinziContini's ignore it and ignore it and ignore it...until they no longer can and the precedent that De Sica has set is torn down. That 500 year old estate has no bearing.".

The vile undertone of antiSemitism lurks throughout and FinziContini's ignore it and ignore it and ignore it...until they no longer can and the precedent that De Sica has set is torn down. That 500 year old estate has no bearing.";

Vittorio De Sica's late career masterpiece exposes the hopeless plight a lot of Italian Jews faced as the lunatic Mussolini got further and further into bed with Hitler during WWII. The FinziContinis a welltodo family of intellectuals fail to realize the rising tide of antisemitism around them as their vast estate becomes more and more a sanctuary for their equally blind friends. Unrequited love and missed chances at romance are dwarfed in importance as the Nazis move in. This is a very unsettling movie as you're well aware of what is going to happen to these people. De Sica and five or six uncredited scriptwriters creates a real sense of dread and the film is populated with an excellent cast. Lino Capolicchio is the standout hopelessly in love with FinziContini dbutante Dominique Sanda. As Sanda's infirm brother Helmut Berger personifies an entire race of people about to be systematically eliminated. Fabio Testi and Romolo Valli excellent as Capolicchio's grotesquely optimistic father are in it too.".

As a result Giorgio's romantic plight which occupies considerable screen time has a limited emotional impact.  Since we never really get close to him aspects of the movie are less compelling than they might otherwise have been.

It deals with a wealthy Italian Jewish family living in a secluded estate in the city of Ferrara. The FinziContinis are almost completely assimilated and have little in common with their fellow Jews but once Mussolini's racial laws begin to take effect they open their gardens to young Jews from the neighborhood. The movie depicts the fatal passivity of people who think they're safe that monstrous social upheavals won't touch them. Slowly but surely the Jews of Italy have their freedom taken away from them before they know what's happening they're headed for Auschwitz. The movie leaves the fate of the FinziContinis unresolved but we know from the novel by Giorgio Bassani that none of them survived. This film is beautifully photographed with the visual opulence one has come to expect from Italian cinema with a haunting score and memorable performances especially by the ravishing Dominique Sanda quite possibly the most beautiful woman to ever appear on film. This is a movie everyone should see since it drives home only too clearly the lesson that freedom can never be taken for granted that what happened in Nazi Germany or Fascist Italy could happen here too. No one is safe.".

Into the circle steps Giorgio a Jew from the middle class who falls in love with Micol.The Garden of the FinziContinis won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and was nominated for Best Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium. It won the Golden Bear at the 21st Berlin International Film Festival in 1971. It is considered de Sica's penultimate film though this depends on how you count.The film itself is very beautiful and the quality would make me think 1980s more than 1970. Italian cinema tends to be behind American cinema in technology and I am quite impressed with what they were able to achieve here. It really is something of a masterpiece in the look. The characters are well fleshedout and I am not surprised that some of the actors went on to bigger things e.g. Helmut Berger.One thing that strikes me as interesting today 2017 is how films around the Holocaust have been consistently successful in awards season. This was almost 50 years ago and today we still get the Holocaust film again and again. That is not a criticism of the filmmakers. There is no story more powerful in the last 100 years. It just strikes me as interesting how film has chosen that as the nexus the focal point. You might think American films would try to pivot to 911 admittedly a far far smaller event but this has not really happened.".

The FinziContini's however believe that their position of wealth and their very home will shield them from being touched and they move on oblivious to the world outside in a frozen period of time and space that seems for a moment to spare them until it becomes rather clear that the walls that so protected them are beginning to crumble and that they are headed towards an inevitable train wreck which will destroy all that they know. As their rights and the rights of the Jewish people are stripped away from them they find themselves suddenly awake into a reality they cannot understand but must move into. DaSica's movie is a slowmoving lyrical poem which differs from his earlier NeoRealist work and captures in its running time this illusionary reality as if all this were a dream that the FinziContinis were having. The filtered lens only maximizes the almost enchanted beauty that pours through from the screen and onto the viewers' eyes indeed this is nostalgia for a time gone by a trip down memory lane and a subtle incursion into a denouncement of the horrors of war which never rears its ugly head but whose presence ultimately swallows a family whole.".

	schema:headline " Best Turkish film of the 1980s";
	schema:reviewBody "I am completing a thesis on Turkish cinema. I have seen many Turkish films and I think this is definitely one of the five best and certainly the best one of its' era though the underrated Polizei which Yol's codirector Serif Goren helmed is right up there. Yol is amazing for many reasons. I have heard some amazing Hollywood back stories of how films like MASH and Apocalypse Now were hellish shoots. But none of them matches what the filmmakers did on this project. Yol was secretly filmed and the entire cast which included box office icon Tarik Akan risked being blacklisted. The film was subsequently banned in Turkey until 1992 and it was not shown theatrically there until 1999. It is a scathing indictment of political and social oppression in Turkey in the early 1980s. Symbolism is used throughout the film with birds representing freedom horses representing virtue and women representing oppression. Many Westerneners have labeled Yilmaz Guney Turkey's best known director who envisioned Yol from his prison and then while in exile a champion of feminist ideals. But if one sees some of his earlier film like Canli HedefLive Target they might be in for a surprise that film features an offcamera rape of a 10year old girl. I like Guney's films but I agree with Serif Goren's assessment that his contributions to Yol were completely overlooked. Goren proved to be a capable director in his own right and his film 10 Kadin10 Women is perhaps the essential film for expressing ideals which are sympathetic to feminism a movement that I sympathize with in terms of Turkey but am neutral towards in the West. Yol also deals with Kurdish suppression. One of the more poignant moments in the film comes when Halil Ergun's character comes to back to his hometown Diyarbakir in Eastern Turkey on the train during his prison leave. He comments how strange it is to be back home. The central theme of the film is that the oppressive elements of prison life are evident just as much on the outside. Personally I think Turkey has made significant progress in recent years. It is a shame that except for Michael Moore Barbara Kopple and Tim Robbins very few American film makers take these kinds of risks that Guney and Goren did with Yol. In my view the more recent Turkish film Distant has surpassed Yol as the best Turkish film ever made but this is still a magnificent artistic achievement which can be merited as a classic in terms of international cinema.".

This is especially true considering that it was made in one of the most difficult times in Turkish history to make a movie of any sort especially one with such strong social and political commentary.The story is a powerful and fascinating tale of several prisoners on temporary leave from a prison and the crucial events that they face. Tragedy and sadness are prevalent despite the fact that each character's leave has a very different outcome and the film excellently and compellingly explores how the characters must face their difficult circumstances. It addresses a wide range of forces political social familial that impact the lives of the characters and comments on all of these. The film's exploration of these issues ranges from blunt and harsh to subtle and satirical and the actors are simply fabulous.The result is a compelling extremely moving and thoughtprovoking film. However people who watch it should avoid using it as a guide for what Turkey is like today especially in certain aspects. They must remember that this film is over 20 years old and was made at one of the darkest periods in Turkish history.".

Similarly the simplicity and passivity of the prisoners is contrasted with the mechanistic social and structural violence surrounding them.There's a strange innocence to the way in which most of the main characters in this film use their fleeting moments of freedom to further imprison themselves in pain obligation and debt. Of the five stoic yet gentle prisoners given a week's parole to travel to their respective homes all of them are transported into different contexts of confinement  whether emotional psychological or physical  full of restrictions and seemingly foregone conclusions.Restrictions on the freedom of movement sexual urges existential choice gender roles and other forms of social behavior creates a kind of emotional numbness in the main characters' and their wives'already drained dispositions. In light of their inability to negotiate their surroundings it seems as though many of them willingly succumb to what they might perceive as a predetermined fate.Looking at just one of the five stories after arriving home one of the men is encouraged to kill his adulterous wife in order to save the family reputation while she's held in isolation as a prisoner in a remote mountain village. The roles have now been reversed and the situation grows in complexity to the point where the man's indecisiveness contributes to his wife's death in a vast frozen landscape. In the film's greatest sequence the man takes his wife and son back across the arctic emptiness where the carcass of his abandoned horse  one of the many symbols of freedom and strength in the film lies picked apart by birds wolves and the wind in the very place where his wife will die providing the perfect image of a man a woman a child and a country exposed ravaged and forsaken in an emotional wasteland.".

Unfortunately for 17 years Guney's Yol was considered to be forbidden fruit by the gatekeepers of the oppressive Turkish regime.

	schema:reviewBody "I had no experience with Turkish or any Middle Eastern cinema before seeing this and it made me want to see more films from this part of the world. It is essentially a travelogue with completely separate stories of several men and their encounters in various parts of Turkey during temporary furlough from a government prison. For example one of these men is a Kurd and another wants to take possession of his wife who disgraced him by having an affair while he was away in prison. All of these story lines remain completely separate throughout the film and it is in this peculiar structure different from an American movie like Magnolia where the stories interconnect in some way where the film's greatest strength and weakness lie. The strength is that this is a great way for a Westerner like myself to get a good overall introduction to several aspects of Turkish society. The weakness is that the first half of the film is exceedingly difficult to follow we never get a chance to know any of these characters because the director constantly cuts from one storyline to the next which caused me great confusion.Despite the flaws directors Goren and Guney display a true filmmaking talent here. This is one of the harshest movies I have ever seen on a par with other films like Pixote in its unflinching brutality. These two directors have portrayed 1980s Turkey under a military dictatorship as a true hell on earth  a society stuck in the Middle Ages and obsessed with rigid archaic sometimes brutal Islamic customs.With its muckraking tone I doubt this film has ever been shown in even a comparatively free Arab country. I also imagine this will be a particularly difficult film to watch for women as the traditional Islamic punishment for female infidelity is presented quite graphically. There are several agonizing scenes that remain frozen in my mind  especially one in which one of these prisoners must journey on foot with his wife and son through an isolated arctic wasteland. It is in scenes like this during the second half where the movie becomes truly involving. These scenes are so exceptional that it made me disappointed that this film wasn't better than it is it had the real potential to be a masterpiece but took too many amateurish missteps. Luckily the missteps were not for lack of ambition.".

In fact at some point it becomes evident that most of the main characters are safer in prison than outside. Their lives are certainly more at risk travelling through the country than behind bars.2 Sometimes you do what society tells you you have to do even when nobody will be better off. This is particularly evident about the end of the movie spoiler alert when one of the main characters upon learning of the death of his brother tells the widow I am now your husband it is the code even though he has his eyes on another woman in the village that other woman likes him he does not want to be the husband of his sister in law and the widow and her children do not want him to become husband and father. But it is the code and that suffices. As when at the beginning one of the characters is out during a curfew that he did not know it was in effect and is detained. Everybody understands his predicament but the law says he has to be detained and so he is. In another story a man has to kill his unfaithful wife even though he does not want to.This is a must see. This films will describe not just what was happening in Turkey 30 years ago but what is happening everywhere today in one way or another. It is about living in a prison even though you are supposedly a free citizen.".

I am Turkish and I was a teenager during the time period portrayed in the movie. I can say with great confidence that those days were presented with a great accuracy in many ways. It gives me an opportunity to evaluate the events of that period. The director Serif Goren not Yilmaz Guney because Yilmaz Guney was a fugitive during the time the movie was shot does a great job capturing the mosaic of Turkish culture during the trips of the 5 prisoners on leave for a week. The trip starts from Istanbul  from northwest and ends in the southeast. Editing job was not so great but it still kept the continuity of the story. On the other hand dubbing was terrible  perhaps the only bad thing about the movie  still you have to be a native Turkish speaker to see this flaw. I think the biggest contribution of Yilmaz Guney to this film was writing the major part of the script and producing this great film. A few facts Yilmaz Guney was a fugitive who shot a judge during his trial. So He was not a political prisoner. He wasn't a great actor but he was a good screen writer. There is not a city called Kurdistan in Turkey there never was. The people shown in the movie are Turkish citizens. People of Turkey are not just Kurds and nonKurds there are tens of other ethnicities live in Turkey and they make the Turkish nation as a whole. It's amazing to see some people are still judging a whole nation by just seeing a movie.And one goof The guy in the ferry was drinking RAKI  the famous Turkish liquor however during dubbing it was referred to as brandy.".

The idea of everything going wrong during a trip is nothing new but if properly treated it can produce laughs. But in this movie the things that go wrong are so absurd and contrived that the laughs are lost. What happens to the Clarks would not and could not happen to anyone else hence the movie becomes irrelevant to the audience and loses its meaning as a satire or parody.

The 1999 remake with Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn in the central roles manages to be a far worse film.  The original at least seemed grounded in some sense of reality as the couple fell victim to a believable if overstated series of tourist mishaps  this version spins off into slapstick delirium going so far as to have its main characters actually swinging on hotel signs six stories above street level and John Cleese as a snippy concierge prancing around in lady's clothing to Donna Sommer's Bad Girls.  Also in the original Jack Lemmon seemed determined to really take on all the people who arrayed themselves against him and the film conveyed a real sense of this implacable almost malevolent force known as NEW YORK coming down with all its might on this innocent couple from the Midwest.  In the remake Steve Martin seems strangely passive and unharried and the victoryoverthecity theme comes along only at the very end.  Without that added dimension of epic frustration the new film robs the original of whatever audience identification it might once have had and simply devolves into an undisciplined display of unfunny slapstick.Martin Hawn and Cleese are game players but this OutofTowners should indeed have been driven out of town!".

For some reason Neil Simons script is not used in this film so it falls flat time and time again.  Even the audience I was with never laughed. The direction is very slow and tedious and when there is a joke it is given away so the joke dies i.e. The couple having sex in the park.  They announce it is a lighting ceremony for New York well we all know the lights are going to come on and we will be able to see cute and mugging Goldie  Steve do a bit of slap stick.  The whole movie winds up being like this...a joke is set up and given away. Why isn't Goldies hair ever even messed up in the movie. You will also notice every close up of Goldie they use a very intense soft lens.  I suggest you rent the original with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis that's if you want to laugh.".

He's not crying they are or are likely to. Anyway the parents flinch and then head off from their hick home town in Ohio to New York.Henry has a job interview to attend and we all know what middle aged middle order executives looking for a job might run in to at least in an intelligent script written properly for the nineties.The Out Of Towners was based on a screenplay penned by Neil Simon in the early 70's. The story has been re written for this version but it seems that the comedy slant was firmly in the sights of the producers. The plot was therefore left high and dry.  It needed a much heavier rewrite.Henry and Alice have both been in advertising but Alice has given the game away while she's been mothering the children. Henry is tired and a bit dowdy. It would be expected that a truly modern script would have found Alice moving back into her old career and Henry taking on home duties.Henry says as much in the film! Their daughter has also been accruing horrendous credit card debts on cash stricken Dad's card. This is glossed over in happy land Hollywood. And what's to become of Alice? She's lost for a career.So this emasculated script is left to flounder and to rely on a good deal of slapstick. Neil Simon's clever dialogue is largely gone and the plot is without depth.We're left with a good deal of arm flapping particularly from Goldie Hawn. As I write this The First Wives Club much much funnier than The Out Of Towners is on TV in the same room and there's Goldie again arms a flapping bum a poutin'.If there's a chair either Henry or Alice will fall over it and as is the way these days if there's a buffoon sidekick he'll be gay.But still except for it's contrived energetic humour which some patrons will enjoy immensely The Out Of Towners does work reasonably well. There are one or two warm smiles and perhaps a laugh or two but really a bit more heart and common sense and a dose of plot credibility would have been an advantage.".

It has a better cast Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn are comediansLemmon and Dennis weren't and has John Cleese who is hilarious as a snotty hotel managerhis dead pan delivery of all his lines really worked. Not a masterpiece but not the disaster I heard it wasfor instance the previous HawnMartin movie Housesitter was much worse. This moves quickly has an excellent music score and the stars are both in top form. Worth seeing.";

The mishaps that Goldie and Steve go through are sometimes predictable but are always good for a chuckle. And John Cleese just steals the show.

The only fault in this movie is the last sketch written by Frederic Dard who has less talent than the previous screenwriters. Anyway this Grard Oury gem is Pure French Cinema.I don't know if that early Oury's movie worked but if not I suggest distributors to release in a dozen theatres in France this talented Crime Ne Paie Pas I'm sure it would nicely score and become a new hit by Grad Oury even if not a comedy.".

The story basically revolves around Parivijay and how he transforms the lives of his friends senthiljiva and venkatsrikanth and disappears after their college graduation. The two friends along with one of their old college mate who has his own set of intentions set on a journey to find Pari. Ileana sathyaraj and sathyan all have done a neat job. The dialogues by Madhan Karky really standout and is almost flawless. Harris Jeyraj music may not be liked by all but he has done a commendable job in satisfying a majority of the audience.The bottom line is ShankarVijay combo has come out with this year's first blockbuster and make sure you watch it in Theaters.".

Vijay has given his best ever performance till date. He has given a massive come back after some critics against him and also his acting in this kind of movies rocks more than his mass commercial movies.And as Shankar said After watching this film even an antivijay fan would become his fan has come true as i saw in most of my friends.Jeeva too taking up the role of Sarman joshi has acted nice in all parts especially in that humour sequences encountered with Sathya raj. Shrikanth has done justice to his character fitting into the shoes of Madhavan.Ileana's performance looks a bit less compared to Kareena kapoor but has done good in some scenes.Sathyan as Silencer has completely satisfied his role compared to the Hindi version. Sathya Raj though in certain suitations imitates the Hindi version character but has really done a superb job in this movie as he is the best option to take up this role.Of all the songs in the movieAskku laska and En frienda pola yaaru machan seems to be the winners.Locations and camera works in the movie gives us a fresh look to the movie.This movie is the Best Option for celebrating Pongal With a Message.Finally This will be Super HIT Block Buster movie for sure!!!And a Hattrick For VIJAY !!

	schema:headline " Ilayathalapathy Vijay's Class movie for his fans";
	schema:reviewBody "It has been many years since we saw a Vijay film sans heroism fights and villains  a film that relies only on emotions relationships and situations where character is the hero. There was Jeeva of Kadhalukku Mariyadhai Kutty of Thulladha Manamum Thullum Bhoomi of Kavalan but they were still avatars of Vijay who are heroes in their own right. But the hero this time is Panjavan Paarivendhan aka Paari  the hero Vijay has completely got into the skin of the character that you forget the hero in him. He is your friend your nanban. Literature The script of the movie done by Rajkumar Hirani and Abhijat Joshi has been beautifully adopted for Tamil audience such that you don't feel anything alien in the whole proceedings. The dialogs written by Madhan Karky and Shankar are crisp youthful and fit in exactly with the mood of the scenes. The speech of Silencer which was much acclaimed in the original leaves the audience ROTFL much talked about song lyrics especially Ask Laska and 'All Is Well' are well brought out in the visuals. Lot of intelligence has been put into the film and it has paid off. Chemistry The chemistry between the lead pair though they appear together for very few scenes and couple of songs is really cute and they really make a good pair. Their subtle love that runs along with the story is a delight to watch. But what makes a bigger impression is the chemistry between the lead trio  Vijay Jiiva and Srikanth. It has worked out so well otherwise we would not have been on an emotional journey with them for 3 hours.If there is a backbone that supports the whole film it is Vijay's role as Panchavan Paarivendhan which I doubt anyone else would have done with such utmost sincerity and at the same time fitting perfectly for the character. Having played many physically powerful mass hero roles and sweet romantic hero characters he has shed all his heroism and image to underplay the role of a mentally strong genius. As a naughty student wishing to see a change in education system caring friend who wants his friends to get the best out of life romantic lover who locks his emotions daring youngster to challenge his dean novice helping his lover's sister to deliver a child  Vijay's role has a lot of dimensions to it and shines in each of it outstandingly. From an uneducated local mechanic to a college topper everything comes to him with ease and all it requires is a skilled director to use it in a powerful script. And this time everything has fallen into place which gives every fan the delight of watching Vijay in the role of a lifetime. Thalaivaa! You are great! To sum up Nanban is one of the best engineered remakes. Disliking a film like this definitely prescribes you a doctor appointment for psychiatric cure. You see it as a copy you copy paste your comments of hatred usually made for Vijay films. You see it as a remake you will end up making only comparisons. You see it as a Vijay film your bias on Vijay will alter your opinions. You see it as an entertainer it gives you loads of entertainment more than what you expect. It is a beautiful journey of life that every movie lover will enjoy.".

	schema:headline " Mindblowing Picture after a long time in Tamil cinema";
	schema:reviewBody "I had watched 3 Idiots a couple of times at the time it was released. And was frankly apprehensive how the Shankar version would pan out. I went to the movie telling myself that I should not be influenced by the Hindi version. The first few scenes where Venkatakrishnan and Senthil are introduced the comparisons with the original seemed inevitable. And so it was when Pari is introduced leading intothe electrified spoon scene. However all comparisons disappear as the film progresses and at the end of the movie what remains is Shankar's Paari and the friendship with Venkat and Senthil. A brilliant and highly refined performance by Vijay of Paari. You have to watch this movie to believe it. Nothing is overstated. The warmth of Paari's friendship with Venkat and Senthil is simply overwhelming. Nothing about the performance of the three leading male characters is out of place. The easy acceptance of Paari by Venkat the tentativeness of Senthil the quiet confidence of Paari! Simply overwhelming. Shankar deserves the utmost praise for bringing out the characters so beautifully. Some scenes that standout 1. Vijay with Sathyaraj at the funeralof the funeral of Vijay Vasant. The utter despair is so beautifully expressed. 2. Vijay with Sathyaraj at the principal's office post the funeral where Vijay says he is expressing dissatisfaction with the educational system. 3. The three friends walking out of Jeeva's house joking about Jeeva's family. So brilliantly natural. 4. Vijay expressing his love to Anunya! 5. Vijay and others in the hospital trying to cheer up a comatose Jeeva.Beautiful. 6. Srikanth pleading with his father to allow him to be a photographer. Highly intense emotional and outstanding performances. 7. Jeeva's conversation with Ileana to have her walk out of the marriage function. 8. Ileana in conversation with Sathyaraj about the elder brother's suicide. 9. The final few scenes where the Jeeva Srikanth and Ileana trio meetVijay! Vijay laying on the beach sand getting kicked and beaten up by his buddies with an accepting smile on his face! Such genuine warmth at meeting his friends! Performances wise Vijay stands tall!He looks and plays the part of Paari to perfection. So subtle clean and thoroughly enjoyable is his performance that Aamir Khan is swept out of the mind! Next I have to mention Srikanth. Right from his voice modulation that can particularly frustrating to hear most times to his rather excellent performance. The scene with his parents pleading to allow him to be a photographer is quite genuine. Thankfully I can now put Madhavan and his too oft repeated trademark toothy smile out of mind now. Jeeva is excellent. The only reason why I am putting him after Srikanthis purely due to Srikanth's surprisingly good performance and voice modulation. Sathyan in his best role to date. A little loud and squeaky at times. But gets obliterated by the majesty of Vijay and his buddies performances. Sathyaraj most of the times. Would have been outstanding had he pulled of the cameo dance that Boman Irani does for his daughter! Thankfully it was not Prakash Raj in this role as some reports had suggested when the film was announced. Ileana. Has done well in the few scenes where it was required. Overall a majestic film. Vijay at his supreme best. Go watch it in a movie house multiple times.".

Aalap Raju's Endhan kan munne song totally rocks emotionally. Irukaanaa is a peppy number and VJ proves nobody can beat him in his dance moves. Heartiley battery is another youthful song and with all those huge lips lorry caps huge biceps were different and shows Shankar is Shankar.

	schema:headline " 'Nanban' is extremely faithful to the original and definitely worth watching!";
	schema:reviewBody "The Tamil remake of Rajkumar Hirani's blockbuster Hindi film '3 Idiots' based on Chetan Bhagat's 'Five Point Someone...' novel is the first of its kind in Kollywood history. Helmed by superstar director Shankar his very first remake a top team of technicians including Anthony Resul Pookutty and Harris Jayaraj and an ensemble cast that includes Illayathalapathy Vijay Jiiva Shrikanth Satyaraj Sathyan Ileana and several others 'Nanban' is indeed a mustwatch.Like its original version the story points out the discrepancies in India's educational system which emphasizes cramming and good grades above knowledge and passion for one's chosen field. Told through flashbacks the film follows Venkat Shrikanth and Senthil Jiiva as they search for their college friend who disappeared from their lives after changing them for the better. Panchavan Pariventhan Vijay Venkat and Senthil are engineering students who are unable to cope with the system due to their individual flaws. While Paari scores high with his love of machines and lateral thinking his two friends have a tough time Senthil is put under extreme pressure to graduate and help his povertyridden family while Venkat has no interest in engineering his true love being wildlife photography. It is Paari's unconventional thinking and his mantra 'All is well' that helps both of them succeed in life.But where has Paari gone after graduation? Further details of their college life are revealed including the trio's neverending war with Principal Virumaandi Santhanam aka Virus Satyaraj an eccentric educator who is determined to make sure the three idiots as he calls them don't come up in life. Also added to this colorful cast are Silencer Sathyan a bookish nerd Riya Ileana Virus' daughter and Paari's love interest Swetha Anuya Riya's elder sister and Panneerselvam Vijay Vasanth a senior who loses more than just his degree to the pressures of the educational system. Also a surprise awaits in the form of S. J. Suryah.'Nanban' extracts top performances from all the lead actors. Vijay has undergone a complete makeover and shines in the humorous and emotional scenes. Jiiva Shrikanth and Sathyan are perfect for their roles while Satyaraj does a good job alternating from menacing villain to clown. Ileana does nothing memorable when compared to Kareena Kapoor in the original but she is suited to the songanddance sequences that abound.The film is slightly longer than warranted Anthony could have done a sharper editing job! Manoj Paramahamsa provides the right feel as cinematographer. Harris Jayaraj has rendered some wonderful situational songs with 'Asku Laska' commendable lyrics by Karky! and 'En Frienda Pola' being the picks of the album. The Irukaanaa number seems to have been added in to appease Vijay's fan following and there's no harm in that! As for Shankar himself it is best to follow his advice and watch the film without any expectations. 99 faithful to the original the director has crafted another memorable classic.NANBAN Mustwatch!".

Helmed by superstar director Shankar his very first remake a top team of technicians including Anthony Resul Pookutty and Harris Jayaraj and an ensemble cast that includes Illayathalapathy Vijay Jiiva Shrikanth Satyaraj Sathyan Ileana and several others 'Nanban' is indeed a mustwatch.Like its original version the story points out the discrepancies in India's educational system which emphasizes cramming and good grades above knowledge and passion for one's chosen field. Told through flashbacks the film follows Venkat Shrikanth and Senthil Jiiva as they search for their college friend who disappeared from their lives after changing them for the better. Panchavan Pariventhan Vijay Venkat and Senthil are engineering students who are unable to cope with the system due to their individual flaws. While Paari scores high with his love of machines and lateral thinking his two friends have a tough time Senthil is put under extreme pressure to graduate and help his povertyridden family while Venkat has no interest in engineering his true love being wildlife photography. It is Paari's unconventional thinking and his mantra 'All is well' that helps both of them succeed in life.But where has Paari gone after graduation? Further details of their college life are revealed including the trio's neverending war with Principal Virumaandi Santhanam aka Virus Satyaraj an eccentric educator who is determined to make sure the three idiots as he calls them don't come up in life. Also added to this colorful cast are Silencer Sathyan a bookish nerd Riya Ileana Virus' daughter and Paari's love interest Swetha Anuya Riya's elder sister and Panneerselvam Vijay Vasanth a senior who loses more than just his degree to the pressures of the educational system. Also a surprise awaits in the form of S. J. Suryah.'Nanban' extracts top performances from all the lead actors. Vijay has undergone a complete makeover and shines in the humorous and emotional scenes. Jiiva Shrikanth and Sathyan are perfect for their roles while Satyaraj does a good job alternating from menacing villain to clown. Ileana does nothing memorable when compared to Kareena Kapoor in the original but she is suited to the songanddance sequences that abound.The film is slightly longer than warranted Anthony could have done a sharper editing job! Manoj Paramahamsa provides the right feel as cinematographer. Harris Jayaraj has rendered some wonderful situational songs with 'Asku Laska' commendable lyrics by Karky! and 'En Frienda Pola' being the picks of the album. The Irukaanaa number seems to have been added in to appease Vijay's fan following and there's no harm in that! As for Shankar himself it is best to follow his advice and watch the film without any expectations. 99 faithful to the original the director has crafted another memorable classic.NANBAN Mustwatch!";

	schema:reviewBody "I liked it. Performances are great. It was very nice to see Vijay in such a different role. Is this the 1st Vijay film without an action sequence ? I really can't remember any other. Only after watching nanban I've realized how hard it is to write dialogs for a remade film and when dialogs are so important unlike other remade films like ghilli siruthai and all. There is nothing much to complain except for the look of the film which really wasn't as great as the original. I know how bigbollywood is compared to the tamil industry but if it was someone else other than Shankar I wouldn't have mentioned this. And I would have loved it better if Vijay had tried doing role the being himself rather than playing a role played by Aamir . The Ghillli Vijay in his house is what was required fully in this movie except for the fact that here he is a genius. If you haven't watched 3Idiots there is no way you can spot even a single fault you'll fall in love with this film.More than I can appreciate Nanban or even 3 Idiots as a film the script is the winner. This is what films were invented for. This relaxation I haven't found in a film in a very longtime. Great writing!".

Nanban is working for me because the cast is so perfect its hard to imagine who else can pull it off convincingly like Vijay Jeeva Srikanth Sathyaraj Sathyan IleanaAnuya SJ Surya millimetercentimeter the intelligent guy who tried to invent helicopter with a cam i cant remember the name of but I think he acted in chennai 600028. Photography is superb as usually in Shankar movies. All songs are apt for the movie. All is well a youthful song with many funny scenes Asku Laska is perfect song that explain what kind of songs we watch in movies. Irukkaana is the song where we finally see Vijay and Ileana doing great dance movements. I am glad it was director Shankar who directed this remake. Mainly because I really hoped Shankar and Vijay would do a movie together and which other director in Kollywood is better to make youthful movie than Shankar all scenes are justified and told in a way that it makes sense. Now to the only negative point of the movie according to me the speech scene could have been shorter its like they made it longer than it should be. Otherwise a great movie and this is the only movie I seen in theatre since Mudhalvan. The only movie I really wanted to see in theatre".

For a guy like me who has watched 3 Idiots at least 15 timesI was wondering how am I gonna enjoy it. But believe me as the movie starts I was dragged into the it and I actually got more than What I expected. The success of Nanban will be Mainly because of Shankar's decision not to change much with the script.As far as Vijay is concerned except for one or two scenes he has acted in his own style and he has literally lived the character of Panchavan Parivendan. He has exhibited some enhanced acting and how many movies have you see Vijay get beaten in the hands of heroine or his friends. Thumbs up to him for shedding his Image for the sake of the character. Jiva and shrikanth have done decent jobs and have surely this movie will be a good break for shrikanth. Credit should be given to Sathyan who has done a great work portraying the role of silencer. He makes everyone laugh their hearts out especially in the Teacher's day speech scene. Speaking of Ileana Nanban is great launch pad for her into the Kollywood industry. Drunken Munimma is really admirable.Songs are colourful and Harris jayaraj has come up with some great tunes. Asku laska and En friend ah pola catches the minds.Overall Nanban is a movie that has everything. A film which will make you laughcry and the message it has comes along with you when you leave the theatre. If you haven't seen 3 Idiots then this will be one of the greatest Tamil Movie you've ever seen. If you have seen it already don't hesitate still go for it you will get the original feel of 3 Idiots.".

Vijay got into the skin of the character and is damn good. Initially for 30 mins he tried to imitate amir but then switched on to his own way. His expressionsdialogue deliverybody language was perfect. Hope Vijay will go on in this path itself and wont switch over to movies like velayutham villuthirupachi etc.JILVA did his role exceedingly well. Srikanth is also goodmay not be up to the level of Maddy in 3 idiots but good. Inspite of big cast one guy who steals the show is the silencersatyan... wow... what a performance... whenever he came on the screen I broke into laughter. the body language and the voice modulation is perfect. His speech at the college day function needs a special mention. Harris has done a decent job. I kinda felt satyaraj was not up to the mark... Nassar would suit the virus role better than satyaraj. Cinematography was good and eye catchy. Hats of to shankar for successfully remaking a cult classic. Remaking classics is not an easy job something will be lost in the translation but shankar retained the soul of the movie and presented beautifully to the target audience with minute nativity changes and a suitable cast.

The film follows Madeline's escapades as she has her appendix out clashes with Pepito the boy next door falls in the river and more.  There is a subplot concerning the approaching sale of the school and what it will mean to the girls who live there.  Is it possible to have a happy ending?This extremely watchable movie for children is a wonderful addition to the repertoire of good children's films.  Hatty Jones is a delight as Madeline and the other little girls are fun and expressive.  The leap from book to movie is smooth and successful the film includes many of the books' key elements and will thus be appreciated by Bemelmans' fans.

I for one loved how it was filmed I wasn't expecting another Wizard of Oz or Secret Garden but the film is very nicely shot with some dark serious tones but I particularly loved the shots of the Parisian skies. The music is beautiful as well and has a certain liveliness to it. The acting is very good Hattie Jones has a very likable spunk and with her cute appearance the camera clearly loves her. Frances McDormond is perfectly cast as Miss Clavel staying true to her character. Nigel Hawthorne is given less to do but he does well with what he is given as Lord Covingtonor Lord Cukooface as the girls call him.

Paris never looked so good even if the time line was changed from the 1930s to the 1950s. The transitions from French to English dialogue can be somewhat confusing but in the light of the films overall context they can be overlooked. Film is sweet without being saccharine or overly sugary and the authority figures do not come across as boobs or idiots but rather as believable characters.Its a shame that Hattie Jones never made another movie. Her portrayal as Madeline hits all the right notes. She will not disappoint Madeline fansand there are many including myself. A charming movie and a treat Madeline has an overall sense of innocence that seems all too rare in this day and age. Surprisingly intelligent and faithful to its sources Madeline is a keeper!".

Her portrayal as Madeline hits all the right notes. She will not disappoint Madeline fansand there are many including myself. A charming movie and a treat Madeline has an overall sense of innocence that seems all too rare in this day and age. Surprisingly intelligent and faithful to its sources Madeline is a keeper!";

Admirers of Bemelans cite his charming economical use of words and images. He also illustrated his stories. Madeline the film is by all accounts a faithful homage to this man's notable children's literature.It's possible that some parents have schooled their children to appreciate the Madeline tales but if they haven't it's likely that Madeline will be considered a little too tame by all but the real littlelees. There's just none of the brash relatively violent noise of most children's film fare here.However the film does star Frances McDormand Fargo and Nigel Hawthorne Yes Minister The Madness Of King George and they do what they can with a film that some will find charming.Hawthorne in particular is particularly touching in one of the final scenes. And young Hatty Jones is appropriately determined and fearless.".

The casting of Frances McDormand was impeccable. She had just the right amount of feeling and structure for the role. And the writers didn't revert to the old trick of using the lead authority figure as their comedic relief. It would have been a shame to have reduced the figure of Miss Clavell to that of a clown. Several stories from the books have been wonderfully intertwined and makes for great viewing. Young Hattie was a great find for the role of Madeline as well not precocious just darn good. This is a great family movie though not necessarily for the young boys of the family. It was made for girls who know and love Madeline. I highly recommend it!".

This film is magic and unlike a lot of children's films made nowadays it was not covered in so much sweetness that it was overpowering. Madelineplayed superbly by Hatty Jones in her only film to dateis a little girl who lives in a school run by a nun along with a lot of other little girls. When the owner of the school threatens to shut down the school and sell it Madeline and her friends come up with daring schemes to repel future owners of the establishment. The movie has plenty of humorous moments including an hysterical meal scene involving a dead chicken called Fred. Children don't need films filled with innuendo or heavily coated with saccharin they need films that remind them what it is like to be a child and the wondrous magic that that involves.This is such a movie.It is a film that any parent would feel is perfectly safe for a child to watch without supervision. The only minor problemas my wife pointed outis the occasional switch from English to french which younger children might find confusing. That aside this a delicious children's movie that can be enjoyed by the whole family time and time again".

However just as good as she is at getting into trouble she is equally as good at working out a way out of it. When the kindly Lady Covington dies Madeline's school loses its most ardent sponsor and faces closure when Lord Covington decides that he no longer has to humour his wife by keeping it open. Obviously none of the girls want this to happen but Madeline must also deal with other problems as well  not least of which is some sort of plot surrounding Pepito the son of the Spanish Ambassador.I had not heard of this film or the famous stories from which it had come but I watched it hoping for a strong child character in a strong family comedy drama. Sadly what I got was a very muddled film that has a couple of plots and forgets to do a great deal with any of them. I appreciate that the character is the heart of the film but that doesn't excuse how messy and poorly focused this is for the majority. It does have some good aspects about it and I can see why some older preteens might like it but younger than that and older than that might struggle. For me the main thing the muddled delivery did was rob it of a sense of fun and prevent anything flowing.At times the tone is silly and childish at others it is serious and intimate  but it never feels like it is all in one movie and again fragments the flow of it. The cast try hard to work with it but understandably they seem unsure of the tone of the film a fault that must be put at Mayer's door and it shows. McDormand is solid but unspectacular while Hawthorne clearly felt that turning up for his scenes was enough. The star is of course Jones as Madeline. She is a strong character but not developed beyond what she can do herself. I have no vested interest in the character but I was a little disappointed with what they did. Daniels is poorly used while De La Osa is purely annoying.This all might just about do the job for the older preteen audience but younger won't care and older will want more than this delivers.

Pepito Genevieve the dog the circus performers i remember them all very fondly.it was a very cute little movie but as an adult the selling point for me was the incredible Frances McDormand. she is such a great actress who never gives a bad performance. even when i think the movie is bad she is always really good. this might not be one of her more demanding roles but the performance is strong smart and sure. playing a nun is a fairly complicated thing to do and she brings it off like a regular Debbie Reynolds. her performance is respectful restraint and never crass. i mean come'on folks religious denominations are a touchy subject. but not here in this film.this film is perfect for all children and contains nothing offensive except for the word 'Damn'. and if you can't handle that get the heck out of the kitchen dopey. the main thing that should be cautioned is the irresponsible use of fire crackers. sure i thought the scene was hilarious but throwing fire crackers under a person's feet can do serious harm and parents should definitely talk to their kids about that one.all in all this was not a great film or a deep one. but it was awfully sweet and cute.".

Pepito Genevieve the dog the circus performers i remember them all very fondly.it was a very cute little movie but as an adult the selling point for me was the incredible Frances McDormand. she is such a great actress who never gives a bad performance. even when i think the movie is bad she is always really good. this might not be one of her more demanding roles but the performance is strong smart and sure. playing a nun is a fairly complicated thing to do and she brings it off like a regular Debbie Reynolds. her performance is respectful restraint and never crass. i mean come'on folks religious denominations are a touchy subject. but not here in this film.this film is perfect for all children and contains nothing offensive except for the word 'Damn'. and if you can't handle that get the heck out of the kitchen dopey. the main thing that should be cautioned is the irresponsible use of fire crackers. sure i thought the scene was hilarious but throwing fire crackers under a person's feet can do serious harm and parents should definitely talk to their kids about that one.all in all this was not a great film or a deep one. but it was awfully sweet and cute.";

Set in 1950s Paris based on the poems by Ludwig Bemelmans Madeline portrays the life of twelve school girls the youngest of which an orphan is called Madeline Hatty Jones and their teacher Miss Clavel Frances Mc Dormand.The film has two main plots that are seamlessly woven together in addition to many other smaller elements from the original stories. The first consists of a plan by the recently widowed Lord Covington Nigel Hawthorne the school's owner to close it and sell the buildings. The second is a scheme to kidnap Pepito Kristian de la Osa the troublesome son of the Spanish Ambassador who lives next door. Discovering these Madeline sets to work to try to save her school and rescue Pepito enlisting the help of her colleagues and having many other adventures along the way.Throughout the film the acting is of a surprisingly good standard perfectly recreating the characters in a highly realistic manner including well rounded and cleverly thought out personalities. The incidental music written by Michel Legrand does a wonderful job in creating the correct atmosphere be it jovial or sorrowful with an amazing degree of symphonic painting.Overall Madeline is a film that is well worth watching with just the right mix of humour suspense and fun that keeps its viewers entertained from start to finish.".

That year in Kindergarten we watched this movie and it was great because it was just like the cartoons I watched on Toon Disney. It captured the imagination very well even if it was a little scary.And that's it's single flaw the PG edge. I watched it recently and this movie doesn't really do anything for me outside of nostalgia. I can see how it's great for young children but not really beyond that. I'm kind of board as a young adult would have been board as a teen and would have been board as an 8 year old. The 2 swear words Pepeto's animal room and the kidnapping plot main contributors to the PG I suspect don't really do anything to make the movie more appealing for older audiences. All I can see these doing is make it less appealing for parents and guardians to put this on for their young children. While all the plots are handled realistically they laid them on a tad thick considering that the TVY cartoon could pull them off without being too scary.I recommend this for the target audience of young children and don't be too turned off by the PG rating. This isn't Goonies PG this isn't Star Wars PG this is Frozen and Moana level PG.".

But actually like the English title already states it is seven films in one. The common denominator here is the car that appears in all seven short films. The entire film runs for approximately 95 minutes at least in the version I saw so the average short film length here is a bit under 15 minutes. This film came out two years after World War II and if you wonder what the word Aufarbeitung in the title of my review means it stands for coming to terms with what happened. But this is only partially true as this film is not really about the political and military elite of Nazi Germany but about the normal people from the population and their struggles and characters during these darkest years in German history. Many of the still prove they are good people. All in all there were some interesting segments and some not so interesting. It probably depends on your personal taste which segments you like the most. My favorite was maybe the final segment with the young mother and the man who helps her. The writer and director here is Helmut Kutner and this is an early career effort by him. He went on to become one of the most impactful German filmmakers in the 1950s maybe the number one. With In jenen Tagen he gives us already an early display of his talent. I recommend the watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "Produced shortly after the Second World War in Germany In Those Days is a film about the lives of ordinary people in Germany during the lead up to and duration of the war. The story begins with two mechanics disassembling a car after the war and continues when the car itself begins to narrate the events of its life meaning that most of the film is told in flashback. This device of an object narrating its own past is an interesting one at best. While it does allow for a quite broad and neutral perspective toward history it is a bit too strange to really convey the plot without distracting from it. The car in question is also far too overtly personified to act in the role of a reliable neutral narrator instead it seems to have a personality and human point of view. The narration leads into a series of flashbacks telling the story of successive owners of the car. A problematic aspect of this device is that the car changes owners in successive stories with little to no explanation about the change of ownership. Taking this with the fact that a few of the actors in the early sections of the movie look somewhat similar to one another and it leads to a very confusing early section of the movie. More than once it is quite possible to assume that one character is another from a previous vignette only to realize that the character is merely portrayed by a similar looking actor. Eventually you begin to assume that characters appear in only one story and just as this fact has made itself comfortable a character from an earlier story makes an appearance in a later one. The disconnected nature of the stories causes the film to read more as a series of vignettes with the car as a loose unifying theme than as a solid narrative. Unfortunately the stories vary extremely in their ability to entertain or even hold interest. One story will be quite interesting and well paced while the next will be slow illpaced and quite frankly boring. One of the few areas in which this film does excel is in portraying the slow slippery slope of the Nazi rise to power. Each story moves its characters further into the restrictive policies of the Third Reich. At first it is simply a man fleeing the country then a composer whose music has been banned a Jewish woman whose store is destroyed.All in all this film seems to be best considered a curiosity a soso movie centered on an interesting though poorly executed plot vehicle. An interesting viewing but best left for the curious and historically interested.".

The cemetery is one of the most stunning locations since Scarlet O'Hara walked through the endless Confederate dead.

Part of what makes it so exceptional is that Chereau refuses to privilege straights in the narrative. For once THEY are the ones who have to explain themselves. Gayness is a given. It's hard to speak of big scenes in a film that gives you one after another. But the one in which the mourners watch the coffin go by in a car as Jeff Buckley's The Last Goodbye plays on the soundtrack has got to be one of the finest of modern cinema.

Amazingly one of the comments I've just read suggested that next time around the director employ a scriptwriter. This comment displays an ignorance verging on the colossal given that Daniele Thompson who cowrote the script from her own Original idea is one of the outstanding screenwriters in French cinema having started with a classic 'Le Grand Vadrouille' at the age of 24 and progressing through such wellreceived titles as Le Follies de Grandeur La Reine Margot until she began  with La Buche  to direct her own screenplays.

Amazingly one of the comments I've just read suggested that next time around the director employ a scriptwriter. This comment displays an ignorance verging on the colossal given that Daniele Thompson who cowrote the script from her own Original idea is one of the outstanding screenwriters in French cinema having started with a classic 'Le Grand Vadrouille' at the age of 24 and progressing through such wellreceived titles as Le Follies de Grandeur La Reine Margot until she began  with La Buche  to direct her own screenplays.

For one thing the subtitles are part of the letterboxed movie imagenot a separate subtitle track that you can turn on or off as you can on most DVDs.  The subtitles were also difficult to see since they were small and there were a number of times that they were white lettering on a white background and almost impossible to read.The transfer to DVD didn't seem to be especially great since most scenes were very dark or with very dark portions and then extremely bright portions.

It's my guess that they made the DVD transfer off an English language reprint of the film with subtitles embedded in the image and not off the best available French masters.  I also suspect they used the same transfer for both DVD and VHS versions of the film.  I found it difficult to see what was going on since a lot was extremely dark and I could only see silhouettes of people's hair or heads while at the same time trying to read small poorquality English subtitles.I find it hard to comment extensively on the content of the movie since I was so bothered by the poor quality of the DVD and I couldn't pay the best attention to the story.I would guess that many nonFrenchspeaking audiences wouldn't be especially interested in this film because there are many characters to keep track of and they all seem most interested in bickering with other characters about romantic or sexual escapades.  It all began to make some sense by the end of the moviewhen I finally could put together some context for the characters.

	schema:reviewBody "Wow what was this about? I rented this film with no knowledge of plot characters actors directors anything. All I knew was it was filmed in France with English subtitles was contemporary and had a gay plot or subplot. As I write this it occurs to me that I must have liked it. I love to critique film yet unless I am moved emotionally or psychologically I rarely want to write down why or how a film has affected me. This film affected me. ...........................SPOILERS AHEAD........................ Let's start with the basic plot line. A rather minor painter in Paris has passed away and has asked to be buried in his old home town of Limoges in the south of France. 14 of his old friends relatives lovers and hangerons board a train in Paris early in the morning for a few hours ride to the funeral. The painters body is not on the train but is being driven down in a Pugoet station wagon. They all meet up at the cemetery where a man reads a poem in English and one of the lead male characters translates into French. Men and women standing around the grave cry openly. The majority of the mourners end up at a huge French chateaux for a wake. There over the next 12 hours or so everyone engages in a nonstop bitch about sex money relationships marriage children love and inheritance not in that order but all subjects are covered by everyone by the next morning. Now.....What was this film about? It took viewing through the first hour of this 2 hour film for me to realize that many of the men were gay or bisexual and had been lovers of the now dead minor painter. Now I know that Europeans and particularly the French have always been more accepting of same gender love but what took me so long to get a handle on what was happening in this film was the way that homosexuality was being portrayed. It was taken as almost natural that most of these guys had been a part of the painters life at one time. Not only natural but simply the way it was. There was no censoring gay as evil or a perversion. That really did not exist. They had all loved the dead man and they were all grieving for him in some manner. What about the women in this film? Other than some older female relatives and two younger women most of the characters were men. Is it intimated that these women had been lovers of the painter? This is not clear however more unusual is the fact that these women have been either lovers or wives of some of the guys who are mourning for their dead lover the painter One of the male characters the one who drove the body down from Paris is married and his wife and child are on the train to Limoges with everyone else. They go to the funeral and the wake. When her husband is driving the body down to Limoges the guy picks up a hitchhiker and uses him as a sounding board to verbalize his grief over the dead painter. He says something like  I carried him around washed his body worshiped him Does his wife know of his relationship with the dead guy? Did she approve? What is that all about? There is another character who falls in love with a very cute dark haired guy he meets in the railway station as everyone is boarding the train in Paris. They catch an erotic squeeze in the trains toilet. Suddenly you are introduced to a woman who is the older guy's wife? Lover? Old girlfriend? She is very upset. Is she upset over his relationship with the young boy or is she angry about something else? Yet another male character is gay and he drops his hold on the older guy who loves the young boy. I assume because he wants them to happy together but without him. To top all this off there are old aunts and I think fathers and other people who have something to do with the dead painter but whose role in all this drama isn't clear. Finally there is the transsexual Viviene. She used to be Frederic and sill has Fred's equipment but with boobs as well. Did Frederic have a relationship with the dead painter to? I don't know. Viviene's role in this film is also unclear yet she seems deliciously happy that no one at the funeral and wake has figured out that she used to Fred. So you see this film is extraordinarily complex. I said it affected me and I was not quibbling about that. I will watch this film again not tonight!. It stupified me. The negative about this film from an American point of view is of course the beautiful French language that I don't understand. I know the intricacy and double meaning that the French can put into dialog and I'm sure the translation into English subtitles butchered some if not a lot of the meaning of the interplay between characters. Also the subtitles themselves were small and in white not yellow as they should have been making it very difficult to read and understand. Other reviews have mentioned the darkness of the film. I found that not distracting at all. Many of the sequences in the chateaux are dark to fit the sometimes bizarre and somber storyline. Others were emotionally head on perfect. The crowded speeding train with claustrophobic atmosphere carrying all the former lovers and friends hurtling south across the French country side so they may have a last goodbye. The cemetery huge with 180000 dead souls in the bright sunlight. All filled up to the brim with symbolism and portent. This film is a strange one. Wonderful acting really top notch all around. The camera work is unique and very stylish. The camera floats along at times sometimes delivering very long hypnotic track shots. Sometimes the camera is in a helicopter or plane and the sweeping shots of the city of Limoges and the cemetery are very arresting. Most of the scenes in the rest of the film were shot with a hand held camera and cameras. This gave the film an aura of gritty realism and was not the least distracting. I'd have to say the film is strangely Robert Altmanish in texture and characterization. In fact this film would have been more powerful with a deeper insight into all the characters involvement with the dead painter. Altman would have shot enough for another hour or longer. It would have been just a little easier to understand all the intense emotions and motivations. But This was not an Altman film. It was a very unique and off beat art film that I will watch again to see what I missed. Don't buy it rent it it makes you think. Isn't that what good drama on film is supposed to do? I liked it and recommend it to anyone who loves different and interesting cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "dozens and dozens of movies similar to this seem to come out of France year after year lumberingly slow films based on the intensity of emotion without bothering to give a reason to emote with the characters in the first place. i wanted to like this movie. i watched it once baffled. watched it twice when i had some bearing on which characters were which then watched it a third time after reading other's reviews of it to see if something was simply going over my head. In all i wasted six hours of my life on this film that makes a tedious effort at showing how powerful the emotions and soap opera shenanigans of everyday life can be i suppose. the soundtrack for the film is worth more than the film itself. I've seen some good french cinema that managed to put some movement some effort at entertainment this one yawned and rolled over. I suppose part of it is a bias on my behalf as I generally not entertained by nor am i shocked or offended by transvestitism or gay love scenes. It simply isn't my cup of tea or glass of beer as the case maybe About the only thing i did like about the film was something possibly suggested at that lurked underneath the plot. The idea that funerals for loved ones often serve as exercises for ego competition has struck me at the few funerals i've attended.

	onyx:emotionText "dozens and dozens of movies similar to this seem to come out of France year after year lumberingly slow films based on the intensity of emotion without bothering to give a reason to emote with the characters in the first place. i wanted to like this movie. i watched it once baffled. watched it twice when i had some bearing on which characters were which then watched it a third time after reading other's reviews of it to see if something was simply going over my head. In all i wasted six hours of my life on this film that makes a tedious effort at showing how powerful the emotions and soap opera shenanigans of everyday life can be i suppose. the soundtrack for the film is worth more than the film itself. I've seen some good french cinema that managed to put some movement some effort at entertainment this one yawned and rolled over. I suppose part of it is a bias on my behalf as I generally not entertained by nor am i shocked or offended by transvestitism or gay love scenes. It simply isn't my cup of tea or glass of beer as the case maybe About the only thing i did like about the film was something possibly suggested at that lurked underneath the plot.

Music is used beautifully in the film to underscore a character's emotional state. The rather morbid subject of the film is handled with great sensitivity. This movie is a rather intense experience and as far as the emotional continuity of the film's characters goes it is a bit messy. A common experience I find at least when watching French art films. Perhaps a mere cultural difference. I would certainly recommend the film and doesn't that Pascal Greggory look just like Bruce Willis? The movie is beautifully shot as well Patrice is the man.".

Even then going with it will not necessarily equate to having loved it. The film a piece about life that happens to have that of a dead body at its core enjoys amassing characters and gathering them into the restricting confined space of a train carriage enjoys depicting them speak to one another has fun tackling homosexuality and even finds time to deal with interracial falling outs within wider circles of families still. One of its final shots a full frontal composition of a nude transvestite getting into a bath ought to have been more striking than it was. Is this out of the fact we've spent so much time with these issueridden people that we've accepted this person as a human being and do not jolt? Or is it out of the fact we forget to react out of being numb through such an intense series of dialogues. Spliced into three very distinct sections the film is about love life death and kinship  a film detailing the coming together of those who are apart of a wider family furthermore related to someone that has recently died. In continuing on after the burial the film plays its hand and reveals that it was never about the gathering for the service et al. in the first place moreover it is a film about an apparently crumbling family and a series of exchanges between very aggressive often confused persons doing their best to deal with grief and being stuck with one another under these circumstances. It's here one pays special attention to the title Those Who Love Me Can Take the Train a statement seemingly made beyond the grave a line as if uttered by the deceased in relation to those travelling to his burial at one of Europe's largest cemeteries. This infers that it was never about a family coming to terms with how they felt about the deceased but in fact with each other many of them here do indeed 'take' the train  everybody bar one specific individual. Now that the burial's happened let's see what they all think of each other as the piece enters its final forty minutes.Things are socially awkward at the beginning of the piece starting out at such a stage before taking a bit of a nosedive anyhow. People meet at a station bound for the city of Limoges where the said burial will happen for an elderly relative who made his way through life as a painter. Things are chaotic finding everybody and getting everybody on is a struggle in itself the train rocks around nobody has anywhere to go  two young men find solace with each other in the toilet compartment children are difficult to control and a woman strains to talk about her drug addiction problem. Away from the train Roschdy Zem's character Thierry shoots down to the cemetery in his estate car coffin in tow. He's aggressive and we're aware of what chaos he would have brought to the proceedings on board the train. He picks up hitchhikers that have no relevance to the narrative and later allows his rage to get the better of him en route. We sense Chreau could be producing better. They have a decent ear for dialogue and they spread the screenplay around a table consisting of either gender various races people from different backgrounds and of stark ages. Later on when the family arrive at this huge graveyard there is a neat cinematic flourish involving camera and sound working with one another in a way that doesn't happen at any other moment in what is a two hour film. Chreau feels as if he's reigning things in playing things down  they seem to be going out of their way to create something more neorealistic something that's stripped of mostly all the things synonymous with mainstream filmmaking regardless of nation and more inclined to veer into territory more associated with a brand of cinema people can find frustrating and alienating even though there is ultimately lots going on onscreen. As stated the approach to break the film up into distinct chapters consisting of the travelling to the burial the process of burying said relative and then what essentially materialises as the 'wake' which is the chief point of interest here. For a film with the approach that places so much emphasis on a group of people congregating out of the fact someone in their wider family has died to carry on after the funeral itself in spite of the triumphant aforementioned flourish once at the place we all sense will be the setting for the finale is unsubtle at worst. I'm not sure if the film has as much energy as it thinks it does and there are large sections of play whereby very little neither happens nor is necessarily that important. Where visually and in terms of bare content the film does flounder its overall thematic stands it in good stead for the long run. This is a mature film going about a serious subject matter in a fashion that screams for artistic recognition but one that is far from perfect.".

The beginning was very touching in which we here an interview as a voiceover this is effective. In the title of the film Those who love me can take the train the most important word is love. This film goes to show what real love is. The love is on two levels one part is the love for this man who has died and the other is what happens after the death. The idea of a train being a way of expressing there love is clever. If you think about. Some of the oneliners in this film are quite good. There is also the scene in which a relative reads out a funeral speech which is then translated into french. That is very clever. There is a lot of emotional depth to this film. I feel the film however looses it slightly with repetitive dialogue in the last half an hour. I do think the transexual is a very important and effective character in plot as she helps us to understand about how love can change towards someone when they are something different.".

Too many extreme coincidences unbelievable situations too many people behaving like no real human would ever behave.In particular there were these three wild psychotic teenagers who appeared out of nowhere and decided to chase and torment the two leads throughout the movie with absolutely no motivation and constantly reappearing at the very most improbable moments.  The screenwriter relied almost totally on this for the movie's tensionjust plain lazy and stupid writing.  I mean c'mon the two lead characters were toting around a dead body for most of the movie.  There are scads of more natural possibilities to build suspense around that.  There's no need for crazed teenagers.And also unfortunately there was no nudity in this movie and just a couple of very brief and mostly clothed love scenes between the two women. I'm not saying that all movies or even all lesbian movies require sex and nudity but since this was basically an exploitation film it should have been a bit more exploitative or else there's nothing much to recommend it.I don't recommend it.  4.510 rounds up to a weak 510.".

Story is about two lesbians that try to hide a body after an accidental mishap but things keep going wrong with their plans. Lenni Regina Orioli works for her lover Stella Maya Sansa in a gas station and one day her mother Mariella Valentini whom she hasn't seen in two years comes in and causes trouble. Lenni's mother slaps her and this prompts Stella to enter the scene and strike her back which results in her hitting her head and dying. They decide to try and hide the body somewhere but a car with three troublemakers comes buy and gets some gas and Stella scratches their car as they leave.SPOILER ALERTThey put the body of Lenni's mother in the trunk of their car and drive off to find someplace to dispose of her but things go wrong when they lose their dog and they meet the three troublemakers again who harass them and want their money. The situation ends up back at the gas station where the film concludes with the troublemakers wrecking the place and Stella hoping that they can make it look like they were robbed as the police are due to show up.This film is written and directed by Monica Stambrini who after making several shorts is making her debut with a feature length film and while it has moments of complexity the script just seems to be a rewrite or two away from being really anything special. This has been described as the lesbian version of Thelma and Louise and it does have a few scenes that remind you of that film but this is less energetic than that story. The two leads give earnest performances but they seem to lack any real energy although Orioli is effective as the mousy Lenni. Stambrini shows a flair for telling offbeat stories but this film can't be interpreted as anything but an honest effort by a fledgling director.".

I like the fact that the money is all up there on the screen  lots of tornadoes ripping apart farmhouses and throwing trucks around. I like that it's one long chase movie. I like looking at Helen Hunt's beautiful face. I saw Twister twice at the cinema and at least three times since  and I've enjoyed it every single time. Can you get a better recommendation than that?Twister will never satisfy some people... in particular those who watch it for some strange reason expecting a cerebral masterpiece. Enjoy it for what it is One of the best summer blockbusters ever.".

I like the fact that the money is all up there on the screen  lots of tornadoes ripping apart farmhouses and throwing trucks around. I like that it's one long chase movie. I like looking at Helen Hunt's beautiful face. I saw Twister twice at the cinema and at least three times since  and I've enjoyed it every single time. Can you get a better recommendation than that?Twister will never satisfy some people... in particular those who watch it for some strange reason expecting a cerebral masterpiece. Enjoy it for what it is One of the best summer blockbusters ever.";

	schema:headline " The darker side of writing a script for a disaster movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Twister one of the most successful movies of the 90's mainly due to it's special effects and a lot of people's want for a natural disaster movie that is fun to watch this was an extremely popular movie. I was only 11 when the movie was released and I was absolutely in love with it in fact right after the movie was done I wanted to become a storm chaser. That's how much I loved this movie I grew up and forgot about the movie and decided on a new career. But I saw the DVD on sale and thought about how much I enjoyed the movie when I was younger I'm sure it would be just as much fun to see it again. I have to say this wasn't as awesome as I remembered in the theater it was like Oh my God! Look at that flying cow! A house just flew across the road! That is so cool! now on my TV screen I was like Oh wow look at that cow. How the heck does a house fly across the road? Why isn't this as cool as I remembered it? Not to mention that the story wasn't as good as I remembered granted I know that they had to fit in some kind of story with the whole plot of the twisters but a lot of this movie is just plain unrealistic.In June 1969 on an Oklahoma farm a tornado warning is issued the family seeks shelter in a storm cellar as an F5 tornado strikes. However the storm is so strong that the locks on the cellar door fail and the father is caught up in the storm and killed as his daughter struggles to catch a glimpse of the powerful storm. Years later Dr. Jo Harding the father's daughter is reunited with her estranged husband Bill Harding. Bill is a former weather researcher and storm chaser who has taken a job as a weather reporter. He is planning to marry his new girlfriend Dr. Melissa Reeves and arrives at Jo's research lab seeking Jo's signature for the final divorce papers. Bill discovers that Jo has built a tornado research device called DOROTHY based upon his own design the device is designed to release hundreds of sensors into the center of a tornado to study its structure. The team later meets up with Dr. Jonas Miller a smug and unscrupulous fellow meteorologist and storm chaser. When Bill discovers that Jonas has invented a device almost identical to DOROTHY he vows to help Jo deploy DOROTHY before Miller can claim credit for the idea. Bill and Melissa join Jo and her eccentric team of storm chasers. Tensions rise between Jo and Bill when they have several close calls with dangerous tornadoes as they try unsuccessfully to deploy the new device. So how does Twister hold up over these years? Not so well the effects are still amazing but that's about it. I do have to admit even though it's a bad movie I still enjoy it like crazy. I think because if you let go of how unrealistic it is you can just have fun with that want of destruction and chaos. Granted I know this movie is a bit stupid our two leads Bill and Jo survive the impossible facing an F5 twister the twisters always disappear as our hero's are in danger Bill's fianc puts up with quit a bit before realizing that he is a jerk for putting her through all the danger with him Jo a scientist thinks that tornado's are serial killers and not to mention that this was a record breaking day with numerous twisters. But still as bad as the acting as bad as the story as stupid as some of these situations may be it's still a fun movie to watch and I think I wanna be fair with the rating just because it is mindless entertainment. It's a classic 90's disaster movie and besides it has flying cows what other film will give you that kind of situation? But it's all good I think they were taking the cows to McDonald's anyways.710".

They're not so much portrayed as ordinary storms but rather angry demons from above who wreak havoc on the landscape they even roar like lions at times! Great film.

The reason I will watch this movie again from time to time is that it is FUN. I love the exuberance of Bill Paxton's team I know people like the Philip Seymour Hoffman character and I myself LOVE watching the buildup of a thunderstorm seeing the sky turn green and the way the air smells and feels before and after one of our storms. Yes tornadoes are deadly threats but we ALWAYS have warnings here. There would never be a drivein theater full of people in cars with no idea that a funnel is on top of them but in this movie that's beside the point. It's pure fun watching the screen ripped apart while Jack Nicholson is wielding the ax. If you are expecting true life reality this is not your movie. Just go for the spectacle! The bit of reality in this movie that Oklahoma is lovely in its own way and that some people love thunderstorms and tornadoes was enough reality for me and the rest is just the fun of a cinematic rollercoaster ride with some great special effects.

	schema:reviewBody "Being from the west coast I never had a whole lot of interest in the natural phenomena showcased in this film. Where I live an inch of rain is headline news. I had absolutely no interest in Twister until I saw it was on late one boring night. Having nothing better to do I obliged the television and payed attention. I found Twister to be what I call a nice bedtime movie. While it failed to anthropomorphize the tornado the way Backdraft successfully did with fire the characters were well fleshed out there was a healthy balance of comedy drama and at the time cutting edge special FX. I found that as long as the viewer came in with no expectation Twister would be a fun and easy to watch nappy time movie perfect for watching on a rainy day curled up with a blanket. So to sum everything up don't expect an epic emotionally charged extravaganza but if you are willing to accept a decently woven story with reasonably believable characters and have a rainy afternoon to kill check out Twister. You shouldn't be too disappointed.".

I had absolutely no interest in Twister until I saw it was on late one boring night. Having nothing better to do I obliged the television and payed attention. I found Twister to be what I call a nice bedtime movie. While it failed to anthropomorphize the tornado the way Backdraft successfully did with fire the characters were well fleshed out there was a healthy balance of comedy drama and at the time cutting edge special FX. I found that as long as the viewer came in with no expectation Twister would be a fun and easy to watch nappy time movie perfect for watching on a rainy day curled up with a blanket. So to sum everything up don't expect an epic emotionally charged extravaganza but if you are willing to accept a decently woven story with reasonably believable characters and have a rainy afternoon to kill check out Twister. You shouldn't be too disappointed.";

It's a fun movie with excellent special effects.Some people have complained about the story...I don't get it the story seemed fine to me given the nature of the film.  The movie is about tornados!!! It's not supposed to be a deep and thoughtprovoking film it's just meant to be entertaining and it most certainly does that!!!  I thought the story was excellent and really kept you interested in what was going to happen next the movie flows very nicely from scene to scene from start to finish.  Also I have to mention before I forget that I loved Jo Harding's Helen Hunt's group of storm chasers they were a great bunch of interesting characters!  I loved them all!!!The actors all did a fantastic job and there were a lot of them that are worth mentioning.  Bill Paxton does an awesome job as always.  Helen Hunt if fabulous and looks just as beautiful as ever.  Jami Gertz also did a fine job and looked fantastic.  Philip Seymour Hoffman did a really good job this seems like such a different role for him and he nailed it!  Cary Elwes is one of those few actors that can convincingly play a bad guy and a good guy and is also just as good in comedy films.  He's a very talented actor and did a great job in this film.  I won't mention all names but all of the storm chasers did a great job with their roles.  As for director Jan de Bont Another great film to add to his resume!  I can't wait to see his next film!  And I have to mention writers Michael Crichton and AnneMarie Martin as well they both did a great job with the story!If you're looking for a fastpaced energetic interesting fun movie with some killer special effects then this is the movie for you!  I would definitely recommend this film to just about anyone.  There is rarely anything objectional in the film and I would imagine that this would appeal to a great deal of people.  I definitely think you should see this film.  I really hope you enjoy the film.  Thanks for reading.Chris".

Back then a big budgetbig event movie was considered a huge riski.e. Waterworld and only came out about every 6 months.  Nowadays it seems like every movie is or tries to be a big budgetbig event movie.  Back then the special effects in Twister were considered amazing and it was the first disaster movie to come out in a long time.  Nowadays most movies have some kind of special effects in them and there are tons of disaster flicks made since Twister.

Paxton and Hunt are terrible.She's a tornado researcher who just happens to have a very standard Hollywood backstory Dad you see was eaten by a tornado and now she has a grudge umm scratch that she has a weird Oedipal erotic fixation with tornadoes that makes her trance out and walk towards them like a blond zombie. Uhm... sure. Conveniently this background and volition are explained as I've never seen before in a flashback.  withering sarcasm Moving along...The tornado team you're supposed to root for is a bunch of unlikeable nerds played by unlikeable people none moreso than Phillip Seymour Hoffman who are prone to phony overdirected cheerful outbursts. Each new scene that featured them made me wish for a genre switch from disaster movie to Rrated blood bath. I would have had my own outburst of applause if they had all been sliced open by heavy machinery in the middle of one of their asinine conversations.However the worst dumbest most excruciating part of this turd is that it presents a rival team of tornado researchers as the villain.

They actually make this device even more desperate by having HER deliver the We're finished speech. Relievedly... she's OK with it. Gosh that resolved itself nicely. I'm glad I wasn't asked to feel any tension related to human emotions in this movie. Not since Sean Young excused herself out of the plot in Cousins has a scene designed to erase conflict so infuriatingly failed to erase conflict.Do you know what's at least as entertaining as watching tornadoes break things watching a good script resolve things intelligently or a great script do it cleverly...  being trusted by writers who don't assume you're an idiot.Making the proceedings that much sadder is the fact that the special effects are actually less thrilling than the lowtech canvas sock they used for a tornado in 1939 for the Wizard of Oz !.This movie immediately appeared in a sceneforscene TV ripoff with Bruce Campbell called imaginatively Tornado that somehow made the whole thing even stupider with expensive tornado sequences happening off screen during the commercials.

	schema:reviewBody "POSSIBLE SPOILERS WITHIN!Prolog It is implied later in the film during the dinner scene at auntie's that this nighttime tornado is F5 intensity. This is extremely unlikely. There's just not enough heatlapserate and consequent thermal instability without sunshine.  The fluid dynamics of a guy getting sucked out of a storm cellar just don't work. It would require too much pressure differential in an enclosed space. Stick a small piece of paper in a pop bottle then try to get the paper out of the pop bottle by blowing. Blow across the opening into the opening try anything. Trust me it just won't work.First tornado encountered Mammatus clouds which they admire outside the gas station generally indicate that a storm is waning not at peak intensity as suggested here.  The tornado shown does not emerge from a wall cloud and thus is probably a landspout. Therefore it's unlikely to be F2 intensity as implied.  Storm chasers do not drive like idiots. They're very responsible and safety conscious. Even when deploying damagepath instruments like TOTO they do not deliberately get closer than  mile or so.  An F2 tornado cannot pick up a truck just push it around some.  If it ropes out as shown it's very unlikely but not impossible admittedly that it could reconstitute as it apparently did.  The tornado debris cloud varied way too much in size. In the final seconds it looked to be only a few meters in diameter. Not realistic.  Hiding under a bridge is a really stupid idea. Storm chasers would only do something like that if no other option was available. Second tornado The second tornado appears to be coming out of a wall cloud good for them! but there's no such stormchaser terminology as 'sidewinder'.  There's no way they could assess the Fujita 'F' number just by looking at the tornado. Dumb! No storm chaser would ever say something like that.  The tornado does not move realistically. Spawning of the second funnel is unrealistic. There's no way a second tornado could 'split' from the first as shown. The fluid dynamics of rotation would prevent it. Hunt says they're 'in the flanking line.' They could not be anywhere near the flanking line if they're 'under the core' mesocyclone I suppose that means.  The whole 'cow' scene while amusing is completely unrealistic.  They survive a direct hit from an 'F3' tornado and nothing happens? Don't make me laugh.Dinner at Auntie's I don't even know where to start with the absurd banter in this scene. The whole 'Jack Daniels' anecdote is absolutely impossible. Not even close to possible.Third tornado You can't guarantee touchdown just from Doppler radar. You can determine the existence of a vortex but there's no way to say whether it's on the ground or in the air.  There's a good picture of wall cloud here! One good moment.  Where the hell is the debris in this scene coming from? They're too far from the tornado and not anywhere near the RFD.  The tornado moves too fast. Not realistic.  When it hits the power lines what the hell explodes in a ball of fire???  Cloud motion is not particularly realistic when the tornado lifts.Fourth tornado Once again we have an unlikely level of intensity after dark.  What are these people living mobile home parks? Every damn tornado in the state heads straight for them!  There is a bad misconception that the visible part of the tornado i.e. the condensation funnel is where the wind is. The actual area of strong rotation may be many times larger and strong inflow can extend even farther than that. The visible funnel is only where the air pressure is low enough that the air is at or below dew point. In dry air tornadoes may not necessarily have a visible funnel at all at least until it is filled with debris and dust.  'Downdrafts and microbursts'??? What the hell is he talking about? They took a fing direct hit from a funnel. There were no 'downdrafts and microbursts'The propeller idea I'm not sure about this. It might actually be a good one. Mind you I can't picture a scientist designing objects intended to be carried aloft by the wind that are spherical which is the most aerodynamically efficient symmetrical shape. The logical design would be something with a high drag coefficient not a low one which a sphere would be so that they would be carried more easily by the updraft. It wouldn't be necessary to make little propellers though. Just anything that would increase drag.Fifth tornado Sure is good of that tornado to hang around for hours until the storm chasers are ready! The longestlived tornado on record lasted less than 75 minutes. Oh and they casually drive by the thing on the way to their deployment point. They go from bright sunlight to within a mile of a huge wedge tornado then back into sunlight apparently far enough away from the tornado to prepare their instruments then easily drive to within a few hundred feet of the thing. Yeah right. By the way just because the sensors spill out onto the road how come they're no good any more? Why do they have to be inside that barrel thing? They'd still get sucked up into the funnel even if they're scattered on the road  How can they drive through the flaming wreckage of a tanker truck and not hit anything?  Quibble Explosion of Jonas's truck looked really fake.  Continuity error Part of combine harvester hits their truck on the passengerside windshield. In the very next shot the windshield is intact.  There is no way the truck could drive through even a flimsy frame house and come out the other side undamaged.  Too many problems here to list. In almost all scenes they're way too close to the tornado. They would be right in the inflow and getting their asses kicked by it.  Getting caught in an F5 tornado unprotected Probability of survival very low. Probability of surviving uninjured just about zero. Wind speeds inside an F5 tornado are between 250 and 317 m.p.h. Getting hit by even a small piece of debris would be like getting shot with a gun. Even in the core of the tornado they look like they're getting buffeted by winds perhaps 4050 m.p.h. Yeah right. If either of them got hit by even a small rock traveling at 250 miles per hour they'd be dead as fried chicken.  Following the encounter the tornado doesn't rope out but dissipates in a matter of seconds. Pretty unlikely.  In the final scene it is apparent that the tornado passed within a few meters of the farmhouse yet the house is undamaged. Possible but very pretty unlikely.".

In almost all scenes they're way too close to the tornado. They would be right in the inflow and getting their asses kicked by it.  Getting caught in an F5 tornado unprotected Probability of survival very low. Probability of surviving uninjured just about zero. Wind speeds inside an F5 tornado are between 250 and 317 m.p.h. Getting hit by even a small piece of debris would be like getting shot with a gun. Even in the core of the tornado they look like they're getting buffeted by winds perhaps 4050 m.p.h. Yeah right. If either of them got hit by even a small rock traveling at 250 miles per hour they'd be dead as fried chicken.  Following the encounter the tornado doesn't rope out but dissipates in a matter of seconds. Pretty unlikely.  In the final scene it is apparent that the tornado passed within a few meters of the farmhouse yet the house is undamaged. Possible but very pretty unlikely.";

	schema:reviewBody "I have to admit Twister is definitely an actionpacked film with special effects galore. I liked a lot of the humor that was in this film. BUT!!!!! The story is not so good. The idea that two chasing teams would be so competitive almost to the point of ripping each other's throats out is BULLSHT! Storm chasers all have the same goal...to learn more about tornadoes. Everything that storm chasers do is for the benefit of people who are threatened each year by tornadoes. The movie is heavily testosteroneinjected by far. Storm chasers are never as blatantly reckless as the ones portrayed in Twister. When Bill answer's Jo's challenge Have you lost your nerve? by tightening her seatbelt and flooring it off the road and into a ditch next to the field where a tornado is in progress without knowledge of the predicament he's getting himself and Jo into is definitely the work of Hollywood. I am going to be a meteorology major in college this coming school year and while I don't plan on being a chaser I know I definitely would NOT do what Bill did in that particular situation. Bill mixes his personal life with his professional life WAY too much. It distracts him too much and he has quite a few close calls. One of the first ones happens when he is arguing with Jo in her truck he runs the truck off the road and nearly wrecks into an Army vehicle somebody tell me what that thing was. The idea of DOROTHY was derived from TOTO only in Twister the chasers actually put themselves right in the path of an oncoming tornado just to place an instrument pack like DOROTHY. That too is BULLSHT. No storm chaser in their right mind would do that. To conclude this movie while I do like it somewhat is eye candy lots of action special effects and PG13 language. It almost reminds me of the action movies of the '80s only the enemy is a force of nature containing the fastest winds on Earth. I give it a 4.75 out of 10.".

Many of them were actually pretty good in a rather brainless sort of way. But Jan de Bont's 1996 movie takes the cake. It's the ultimate in summer action adventure.Granted the plot is nothing more than an excuse to create some impressive visuals and loud noises but then again wasn't de Bont's previous feature Speed like that too?. But it really doesn't matter anyway. Actually for a movie like this the story and subplots are pretty welldeveloped.Dr. Jo Harding Helen Hunt is a tornado chaser who with her team of ragtag scientists is about to try and get their new science gizmo appropriately named DOROTHY up in a tornado to get scientific readings. Enter Bill Bill Paxton who has come to get the divorce papers from Jo but he and his highstrung fiance Jami Gertz decide to tag along to see DOROTHY fly.Twister would be just another round of eye candy albeit very good eye candy even by today's standards if it hadn't been for a cast of extremely likable characters. It's a challenge to make bickering people likable but Hunt and Paxton do it. They bicker but it's often funny. Paxton is a normal guy who just wants to move on but he has a good heart. Hunt is not your typical lady scientist and her deadpan delivery brings some big laughs. Jami Gertz is fine as the highstrung fiance who has no idea what she has gotten herself into and Cary Elwes is perfectly slimy as the rival with money but no brains. Lois Smith has some very memorable and heartfelt scenes as Jo's aunt.Jan de Bont has a gift for developing a single sentence premise into a rollercoaster ride of a thriller. Just take a look at Speed his first venture in the director's chair. Twister is just as intense and if I may say so a lot more fun. The effects are outstanding and the cinematography is both beautiful and scary. de Bont also stretches his talent for one liners and physical gags some of which are laugh out loud hilarious.I also have to mention Mark Mancina's score. It's delightfully upbeat with a sense of fun that perfectly compliments Twister. It's enough to get anyone excited for a nearly 2 hour ride. It's a shame that the Oscars didn't recognize his work.Not everything in Twister works. There are a few minor plot holes here and there and many of the minor characters aren't developed though they are put to good use in establishing rapport between the characters and the audiencethe dialogue feels very real and again is often pretty funny. But these are minor quibbles and I chose to give this film a 10 despite them because a they don't dampen the film's entertainment value and b no one will notice or care unless they are looking at this movie from a critic's point of view.Twister may not be great art but it sure is great fun!".

It was a classic very promising mesocyclone. In this situation we would be going ballistic and scrambling to go after it not standing around smelling dirt and commenting it's really talkin' 7 We can't tell when and where a tornado will be by smelling dirt. 8 We can't tell when and where a tornado will be by looking at grass stems. 9 We don't stop in the middle of a chase for steak and eggs at Aunt Meg's. 10 Tornadoes do not growl like a lion 11 We don't have loveinterest arguments while a tornado is bearing down on us 12 DOROTHY is actually a rip off of a real tornado package developed in the 70's by the National Severe Storms Lab called TOTO TOtable Tornado Observatory 13 In a real chase team Dusty would be shot. 14 There are no evil chasers.  We don't compete against each other and we don't get corporate sponsorship. 15 We don't go busting through cornfields and almost cause wrecks by blasting out onto a highway. 17 We don't listen to bopping music when we're chasing a tornado.  We listen to AM radio it transmits lightening flashes scanners CB's and HAM radios usually all at the same time   Some of us have TV's in our cars to tune in local weather channels too. 18 We don't run in to barns for shelter from a tornado. We know they'll be blown away. 19 a belt will not hold us down in an F5 20 even if it did we'd be killed by flying debris.  F5's can lift semitrucks and hurl them around at around 100mph. The survivability potential there is very low. 16 Dirt roads are avoided not good to get stuck in the mud and for the final bit of unrealism the scene where Aunt Meg is saved from the heavy TV falling on her by the coaxial cable holding it back . . Anyone who's ever hooked up video equipment knows the stupid coax's break at the drop of a hat.  There's no way it would have held the TV.And the acting was bad too!!!all in all the movie stunk!

	schema:reviewBody "You don't play with Mother Nature. That's common sense anyone who does well I feel sorry for them. In Twister Nature is given a frightening new dimension courtesy of breathtaking Hollywood CGI effects but it's dumbed down by a questionable script and dialogue thanks to none other than novelist Michael Crichton himself as a coauthor along with wife AnneMarie Martin and subpar acting. Sure a number of liberties are also taken with tornadoes fingers of God  one character calls them but what do you expect from a film directed by Speed Jan de Bont?And lastly who goes to see movies like this for scientific accuracy? I remember watching it with a friend and giving him a nasty tonguelashing afterwards for his redundant pointing out of the various scientific and factual inaccuracies that abound in it which he told me had each been identified by his science teacher  go figure. I snapped back Dude chill out. It's just a movie. Who cares if this does or doesn't happen or tornadoes don't suck like that. I basically told him to get a grip.Nature is unrepentant in its desire to test human will to withstand her destructive forces. I showered praise on Twister for capturing that and making sure its human characters realize it. I make these statements because Twister is quite terrifying in its scenes of tornadoes blazing paths of destruction and this is what people tend to miss when watching it. I know I'm sure to run into flak because of it but what am I going to do shrugs shoulders?As the film opens on the plains of Oklahoma's Tornado Alley the National Weather Service is tracking several storm systems that if they were to merge any time soon they could see a record outbreak of violent tornadoproducing severe weather. Next we're introduced to meteorologist and recent divorce Bill Bill Paxton and fiance Melissa Jami Gertz  She's a reproductive therapist he reassures us after Bill is asked if she is HIS therapist. Melissa isn't too keen on the idea of storm chasing which poses a problem for them both but for Bill it was always the thrill of the hunt and we know he's not going to pass the opportunity to get back in the mode of things.We then arrive at a field where we meet the storm chasers led by Bill's tough ex and fellow meteorologist Jo Helen Hunt who has somehow mysteriously forgotten to sign her name to the last page of the divorce papers she still loves him. When asked if he's back by the various supporting players he emphatically denies he has returned to his field of expertise. But it turns out however that before their marriage went to hell they had been busy developing a revolutionary storm systemtracking device that could give them the inside knowledge of how tornadoes work.DOROTHY real original the miracle device a package that contains hundreds of little sensors could be placed in the damage path and each sensor could provide a detailed map of a tornado's innerworkings and with such knowledge now available they could design an advanced warning system. The trick is however they have to wait until a twister spawns place Dorothy in its damage path or Suck Zone and then run like hell. The action begins when they're forced to take off to chase after the storm and it's about here the film abandons logic and plot for nonstop special effects peril and destruction.Saying the acting here sucks and is uninspired is like saying we went to see Jurassic Park 1993 for the performances  understatement  get real. It's easy for any casual moviegoer to pick apart bad acting and lousy story but come on it's a roller coaster film. I'm not sure I could put it in clearer writing for you about how we don't go to see movies like this for Oscarwinning actors or plot. I've always liked Bill Paxton who I personally see as probably being the next Clint Eastwood and I find it difficult about how he has somehow managed to avoid stardom. Here his character seems to know how the storm functions and what it thinks and in essence he's a human barometer even his wild days as a radical storm chaser do deserve some laughs.The writing is substandard including Jo's barelyhinted upon obsession with chasing the storm as a child she saw her dad killed by a monster F5 Lois Smith as Jo's Aunt Meg who supplies our famished heroes with platters of beef and eggs between effects scenes the underdeveloped storm chasing team some of whom are more colorful than others including Philip Seymour Hoffman as Dusty and the unnecessary subplot involving stiff competition from Cary Elwes as a corporatesponsored rival who stole Bill's invention. But this isn't too glaring a problem if you're a harda for art in cinema and came to Twister expecting it. You'll see plenty scenes of destruction just wait for the drivein showing The Shining and the music that swells up when tornadoes appear.Lastly I can see how anyone who has experienced a twister in their lives could probably want to possibly stay from Twister. I've never seen one and I don't want to. I do know people who have experienced tornadoes in northern Virginia where I live we rarely see the kind of severe weather that produces twisters but my grandparents who live close to me were once in an F1 and thankfully it caused minimal damage to their property and neighbors.Twister isn't a failure it's a simple realization of the popcorn blockbuster. Put aside the hardpressing of art turn off your brain and enjoy but you should still watch out for those flying cows tanker trucks and other debris that can become a hostile projectile if picked up by a tornado's winds it's that simple.710".

But it turns out however that before their marriage went to hell they had been busy developing a revolutionary storm systemtracking device that could give them the inside knowledge of how tornadoes work.DOROTHY real original the miracle device a package that contains hundreds of little sensors could be placed in the damage path and each sensor could provide a detailed map of a tornado's innerworkings and with such knowledge now available they could design an advanced warning system. The trick is however they have to wait until a twister spawns place Dorothy in its damage path or Suck Zone and then run like hell. The action begins when they're forced to take off to chase after the storm and it's about here the film abandons logic and plot for nonstop special effects peril and destruction.Saying the acting here sucks and is uninspired is like saying we went to see Jurassic Park 1993 for the performances  understatement  get real. It's easy for any casual moviegoer to pick apart bad acting and lousy story but come on it's a roller coaster film. I'm not sure I could put it in clearer writing for you about how we don't go to see movies like this for Oscarwinning actors or plot. I've always liked Bill Paxton who I personally see as probably being the next Clint Eastwood and I find it difficult about how he has somehow managed to avoid stardom. Here his character seems to know how the storm functions and what it thinks and in essence he's a human barometer even his wild days as a radical storm chaser do deserve some laughs.The writing is substandard including Jo's barelyhinted upon obsession with chasing the storm as a child she saw her dad killed by a monster F5 Lois Smith as Jo's Aunt Meg who supplies our famished heroes with platters of beef and eggs between effects scenes the underdeveloped storm chasing team some of whom are more colorful than others including Philip Seymour Hoffman as Dusty and the unnecessary subplot involving stiff competition from Cary Elwes as a corporatesponsored rival who stole Bill's invention. But this isn't too glaring a problem if you're a harda for art in cinema and came to Twister expecting it. You'll see plenty scenes of destruction just wait for the drivein showing The Shining and the music that swells up when tornadoes appear.Lastly I can see how anyone who has experienced a twister in their lives could probably want to possibly stay from Twister. I've never seen one and I don't want to. I do know people who have experienced tornadoes in northern Virginia where I live we rarely see the kind of severe weather that produces twisters but my grandparents who live close to me were once in an F1 and thankfully it caused minimal damage to their property and neighbors.Twister isn't a failure it's a simple realization of the popcorn blockbuster. Put aside the hardpressing of art turn off your brain and enjoy but you should still watch out for those flying cows tanker trucks and other debris that can become a hostile projectile if picked up by a tornado's winds it's that simple.710";

Source material are stories by Thomas Burke same author whose story gave us BROKEN BLOSSOMS and the Colleen Moore film TWINKLETOES all of which have white girls involved with Chinese men.Griffith seems to have filmed this one between WAY DOWN EAST and ORPHANS OF THE STORM and maybe there was overlap. Although it's hard to tell from such a draggy copy the pacing of DREAM STREET seems erratic the sets dreary the acting uneven. But there are some brilliant moments. I don't dislike Dempster though a lot of people do. I think she was excellent in several other films. Here the 20yearold seems out of her depth or maybe Griffith was directing her as if she were Mae Marsh or a Gish sister. Mack does far too much grimacing. Graves in many ways gives the best performance one that seems to spin from stock character performance to brilliance.Griffith must have considered this a major production and not just a filler between big projects. He filmed a talkie intro with himself and a couple of sound sequences Graves singing and a dice game scene which were only used in New York City theaters which were wired specifically for for the sound sequences. No other theaters sawheard this innovation six years before THE JAZZ SINGER.Dempster's music hall sequence with dances seems extraneous. As the film winds to its climax it's clear that the music hall could have been excised tightening the plot and shortening the film.The film does not rank with Griffith's several great films but it's not the disaster that many seem to think it is. Dempster and Graves try hard and often succeed. This was Mack's first starring role in a feature film.If you seek out this film look for a copy that runs 100110 minutes and avoid those that drag along to a 140minute running time.".

He filmed a talkie intro with himself and a couple of sound sequences Graves singing and a dice game scene which were only used in New York City theaters which were wired specifically for for the sound sequences. No other theaters sawheard this innovation six years before THE JAZZ SINGER.Dempster's music hall sequence with dances seems extraneous. As the film winds to its climax it's clear that the music hall could have been excised tightening the plot and shortening the film.The film does not rank with Griffith's several great films but it's not the disaster that many seem to think it is. Dempster and Graves try hard and often succeed. This was Mack's first starring role in a feature film.If you seek out this film look for a copy that runs 100110 minutes and avoid those that drag along to a 140minute running time.";

I expected that Griffith's return to Limehouse  courtesy of Thomas Burke's Limehouse Nights 1916  would give us a movie on a par with The Chink and the Child which Griffith filmed so memorably as Broken Blossoms 1919 with Lillian Gish Richard Barthelmess and Donald Crisp giving the performances of their lives.  For Dream Street however Griffith made drastic alterations to both Gina and the Chinatown and The Sign of the Lamp by not only introducing new characters the brothers played by Graves and Mack as well as the subsidiary Power and Wallace figures are totally Griffith inventions but by reversing the roles of those he did retain. Sway Lim sic is actually the hero of The Sign of the Lamp while the girl played by Carol Dempster is the heavy whom Lim beings to justice when he alerts the police by twitching the shade from her lamp with a stiff straight wire as is used for fishing on the Great Yellow River. Try as she may Carol Dempster is no hoyden  no anything in fact  but at least she's nowhere near as insufferable as Graves Mack Peil and Power. DVD available from Grapevine. A bit dark but 710 watchable.".

She also looks pretty in several different shots.However...Charles Emmett Mack that poor fellow who died at age 27 in 1927...is made to look...like a freak. I've seen him in other movies where he looked just fine but in this one I'm glad he made other movies before his demise.Ralph Forbes is pretty much the star of this thing. He however is where more inconsistencies take place. I'll bet this was not his favorite movie. At times he looks positively goofy! Those two reasons among others are why I'm only giving this movie a 6.But ah Carol Dempster! She has been subject to criticism by an awful lot of people but her spritelike quality shines through. Perhaps that was her nice. I know in Sally of the Sawdust 1925...she looks rather...slow.In this movie though she proves she can dance and looks rather good in her costume.One thing that personally disappointed me about the DVD this was on is that it lacked the sound introduction by D.W. Griffith. I was hopeful...Getting to the movie itself three other guys share my view about Gypsy Fair being a fair maiden. Forbes Mack and a Chinaman.While Dempster shines she does something really really STUPID in this movie. She turns the Chinaman in to the police and as he's being arraigned she comes by strikes a feminine pose and suggests to him that he not go after white girls.I'm not even Chinese and that offended me! Also how stupid she could be letting that Chinaman who was also a criminal know she turned him in! Forbes makes a play for Gypsy Fair. She's not interested at first. He gets forceful and she resists at first.Mack? He's just as interested but can't really be considered seriously because of his appearance.Mack pulls a gun on his brother Forbes in the name of an oath that he swore he would kill anyone who touched Gypsy Fair I guess incorrectly. Forbes talks him out of it.However Mack does kill a rather ugly henchman of the Chinaman. I'll give Griffith credit in casting here. The guy who killed looked hideous! Not too long after Mack kills him Forbes comes around and learns of Mack's deed. Because Mack is weak he'll take the rap.To make a long story short Forbes is on trial in deep dark serious trouble. At the last moment Mack confesses and points out that the man he killed was attempting to rob him.At the end we see Forbes and Fair have married and produced a young 'un. I'll give Griffith more credit here. That was a dang cute kid! It gets the 6 due to Dempster's performance. She really does shine though all the inconsistencies.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dream Street 1921  out of 4Typical love triangle has brothers Charles Emmett Mack Ralph Graves falling in love with the same woman Gypsy Fair Carol Dempster and soon their loving relationship starts to fall apart. Things take an even more dangerous turn when the evil Swan Way Edward Peil Sr. takes an interest in Gypsy. You can't help but watch this film and have BROKEN BLOSSOMS in the back of your mind since the stories from both films came from the same book. When this film was originally released it got mixed reviews with some calling it quite poor but others like the Nation Board of Review calling it one of the ten best films of the year. I'm going to have to fall on the negative side. I should mention that the film originally played with a sound introduction by Griffith as well as two other sound sequences but my copy didn't have any of this but I'm not sure how much that would have added to the film. With that said the biggest problem is without question the acting which is pretty horrid. Most people hate Dempster with a passion but I think given the right role she could do nice work see Griffith's THE SORROWS OF Satan but this isn't that right role. She's all over the map here because at times she underplays scenes and then other times she's way too over the top. I also can't help but feel Griffith made her watch Gish's performance in that 1919 film and there's even a sequence here where the evil Chinese lord throws her into a closet and we get that fear sequence which comes off incredibly bad even when you don't compare it to the masterful sequence by Gish. Mack doesn't fair any better as he too seems to be all over the place as is Graves. Tyrone Power Sr. has a nice little part and Porter Strong Griffith's blackface expert has his typical comic relief part. Griffth's direction handles everything quite well but there's just no getting over the fact that the performances aren't very good and we're also missing G.W. Bitzer and this certainly takes away from the look of the film. Griffith fans will certainly want to check this one out just to complete their viewing pleasure but everyone else would be best to stay away.".

Bruckheimer is a populist producer.  He is more concerned with giving audiences what they want than he is about producing films of any artistic value or substance.  In that regard Coyote Ugly' fits right in.This film is energetic entertaining scintillating and fun to watch.  The story is Flashdance lite and is reminiscent of the popular but vacuous Cocktail' with Tom Cruise only with a decent plot woven in.  Violet Sanford Piper Perabo is a young aspiring songwriter who leaves South Amboy New Jersey traveling to New York City to be discovered.  When things don't go as planned she takes a job as a bartender in a raucous singles bar where the sexy female bartenders dance provocatively on the bar to the shrieks of the rowdy patrons below.  Of course there is a love story to go along with the quest for fame completing the populist formula.Bruckheimer defies the conventional Hollywood big budget approach by using an ensemble cast of veritable unknowns and a first time director.  Other than John Goodman in a minor role and supermodel Tyra Banks who hasn't done much acting most of the actors have extremely short resumes.  This gives the film a freshness and energy that comes from the cast's exhilaration at just being on the set.Piper Perabo is an incredible find.  She is not simply acting in this film but living the role.  Just like her character Violet this film is her big break so her ability to understand the character and the role is implicit another stroke of Bruckheimer genius.  Perabo is an excellent actor with tremendous ability and potential.  It is likely that this film will be the launch pad for a bright career.  Maria Bello also gives a fabulous performance as Lil the tough and successful owner of the nightclub. Australian actor Adam Garcia has great chemistry with Perabo as Violet's love interest.  His pleasant demeanor and good looks have many people comparing him with Mel Gibson although it remains to be seen whether he can handle roles that are more substantial.  John Goodman provides one of the film's best moments when he gets up on the bar and dances as Violet auctions him off to the screaming women in the crowd.The DVD is packed with interesting special features about the making of the film.  It also includes a DTS audio option which I like better than Dolby Digital 5.1.  The soundtrack is pulsating and explosive and pumps the film up with excitement.This is not great filmmaking but it is great entertainment.  It is an amiable film that sparkles with energy and is easy to watch.  I rated it a 710.  Many people were surprised by how much they enjoyed it but I'm never surprised when I like a Jerry Bruckheimer film.  He knows how to push our buttons.".

	schema:headline " Heartwarming story overcomes sappy bits.";
	schema:reviewBody "Based on the true story about the crazy female run bar in New York City Coyote Ugly becomes surprisingly believable despite the usual Hollywood bits.  The story follows Violet Sanford Piper Perabo as she moves from small town New Jersey to the city to become a songwriter.  Through her misfortunes she meets boyfriend Kevin O'Donnell Adam Garcia and the Coyotes and learns from each of them to overcome the stage fright that threatens to ruin her dreams.Many moments are sappy or overly dramatic but the majority is enthralling as all the characters are solidly built.  The girls all have their own character but aren't so strictly chained to it that they become merely symbols instead of people.  While the females may be on the screen the most the two supporting males Kevin and William Sanford John Goodman provide the most heartwarming scenes.  Goodman's performance provides subtle humor while his character struggles through the conflict of his daughter leaving and his desire to see her succeed.  For an actor who has put in so many great performances this one still manages to be one of his best.Coyote Ugly offers something enjoyable to everyone.  Guys obviously will enjoy the attractive girls and the provocative dancing while girls can enjoy the strong female characters each of which won't take crap from any of the men that surround them.  Parents can enjoy the side story of the conflict between Violet and her father.  Another feature to enjoy is the fabulous music with four songs performed by LeAnn Rimes with some smaller groups as well.Coyote Ugly crosses the unusual boundary of being both an exciting fastpaced movie that gets the adrenaline flowing and a sensitive story with strong characters and brilliant acting to get the mind working.

But hey story cliches often become that way because they speak to universal truths or at least things that interest bunches of people over of time.This movie is interesting it is engaging and even touching at times. I DID care about the characters throughout the story. I wanted to see how things would work out for them and I wanted them to win. Sure the plot is kind of predictable but the energy kept the theme in the forefront and I AM interested in the theme presented here love taking risks courage and all of that. The women actors were wonderful hot sure but also outrageous in an innocent kind of way. I had the sense that none of the characters in the movie even the raunchy extras in the bar scenes was belittled. I suspected the writers director cast etc. had a basic affection for their subjects and topic.The dancing was great I noted dancing doubles in the credits for all of the girls and the bar tricks and stunts were fun. I enjoyed pretending that those stunts were even possible and that they wouldn't have killed 7 people the first night they were tried in a real bar in real life. I gave this one an 8 out of 10. Go see it you'll like it!".

	schema:reviewBody "Producer Jerry Bruckheimer seems to have an innate sense of what makes money in cinema. He seldom makes a film that isn't profitable and has numerous blockbusters on his resume over the past 30 years American Gigolo Flashdance Beverly Hills Cop Top Gun The Rock Con Air Armageddon. Bruckheimer is a populist producer. He is more concerned with giving audiences what they want than he is about producing films of any artistic value or substance. In that regard 'Coyote Ugly' fits right in.This film is energetic entertaining scintillating and fun to watch. The story is Flashdance lite and is reminiscent of the popular but vacuous 'Cocktail' with Tom Cruise only with a decent plot woven in. Violet Sanford Piper Perabo is a young aspiring songwriter who leaves South Amboy New Jersey traveling to New York City to be discovered. When things don't go as planned she takes a job as a bartender in a raucous singles bar where the sexy female bartenders dance provocatively on the bar to the shrieks of the rowdy patrons below. Of course there is a love story to go along with the quest for fame completing the populist formula.Bruckheimer defies the conventional Hollywood big budget approach by using an ensemble cast of veritable unknowns and a first time director. Other than John Goodman in a minor role and supermodel Tyra Banks who hasn't done much acting most of the actors have extremely short resumes. This gives the film a freshness and energy that comes from the cast's exhilaration at just being on the set.Piper Perabo is an incredible find. She is not simply acting in this film but living the role. Just like her character Violet this film is her big break so her ability to understand the character and the role is implicit another stroke of Bruckheimer genius. Perabo is an excellent actor with tremendous ability and potential. It is likely that this film will be the launch pad for a bright career. Maria Bello also gives a fabulous performance as Lil the tough and successful owner of the nightclub. Australian actor Adam Garcia has great chemistry with Perabo as Violet's love interest. His pleasant demeanor and good looks have many people comparing him with Mel Gibson although it remains to be seen whether he can handle roles that are more substantial. John Goodman provides one of the film's best moments when he gets up on the bar and dances as Violet auctions him off to the screaming women in the crowd.The DVD is packed with interesting special features about the making of the film. It also includes a DTS audio option which I like better than Dolby Digital 5.1. The soundtrack is pulsating and explosive and pumps the film up with excitement.This is not great filmmaking but it is great entertainment. It is an amiable film that sparkles with energy and is easy to watch. I rated it a 710. Many people were surprised by how much they enjoyed it but I'm never surprised when I like a Jerry Bruckheimer film. He knows how to push our buttons.".

If you haven't seen Cocktail it's a movie where Tom Cruise stars as a bartender and he swirls bottles around and other cool tricks of the trade. In Coyote Ugly you have Violet Piper Perabo who comes to NYC to become a singersongwriter. While Violet's there she finds that nobody will accept her demos so she goes looking for work and she finds a job in a local bar called Coyote Ugly. The bar is owned by Lil Maria Bello Lil is a hardcore chick who treats her bar like it's her home. While Violet is there she also learns the tricks of the trade and she also dances on top of the bar. I'm not going to tell you if Violet becomes a singersongwriter or not because that would wreck the movie but I am going to tell you that this is a great movie. Personally I would have to recommend this to anybody that has hopes and dreams of making it big. I'm giving this a 8 out of 10 because it has an amazing story memorable characters and a lot of great lines but I have to tell you one of the best parts is the theme song Can't Fight The Moonlight.

However 'Coyote Ugly' while with its moments has too many faults that are at worst ineptly done to succeed as a feelgood film.Starting with 'Coyote Ugly's' good things the best asset by far is the soundtrack which is quite brilliant and deserved a far better film. The LeAnn Rimes numbers The Right Kind of Wrong Please Remember and Can't Fight the Moonlight particularly stand out of the songs as does the classic Elvis Presley standard Can't Help Falling in Love one of the most beautiful alltime great romantic songs. The score is very nice too.While the acting wasn't great at all there is one good performance and it is that of John Goodman who is an entertaining and amiably likable father figure. Some of the camera work is quite smart too.On the other hand while the music itself is of really highquality it does feel too constant with little break and like there could have been less there were definitely scenes that would have benefited much more without it or at least from music with a less intrusive approach. Too many scenes feel like amateurishly edited and lazily choreographed with a lot of gloss and either being overblown or lacking energy music videos which is a huge problem in a film full of them and with a waferthin story that feels like an excuse to string these scenes together.Also hugely problematic is how clichridden and stereotypical it is. Not just the story which has every done to death clich in the book that everything feels forced and predictable with ridiculous and laughable dramatic elements with little chemistry and no substance or emotional connection whatsoever. We are also talking about the characters in a film loaded with every possible stereotype another problem being that apart from Cammie and Bill very few of them are likable with a difficult to relate to protagonist and some add nothing to the film Maria Bello's character is particularly useless and only there because the film needed the obligatory boss stereotype.Goodman aside the performances are not great or even good at all. Adam Garcia is particularly bad with an acting ability so limited it's almost nonexistent and he feels out of place too. He doesn't even work as eye candy that well. Piper Perabo tries hard but too often lacks charisma and doesn't display a wide range of emotions with sudden shifts in character that undermine the character's growth. Everybody else is bland or annoying though Izabella Miko has moments of charm. Dialogue is painfully trite and thin throughout while the direction lacks panache and flash. The film looks alright especially in the colours locations and the camera work which show a lot of style but cheapened by too much gloss and amateurish editing.Overall there is a great soundtrack but 'Coyote Ugly' falls far short. 310 Bethany Cox".

The trailers don't give you any hint of substance. Perabo is so easy to like. I could watch her for hours. Maria Bello who plays the bar owner is impressive as well. Also in the cast Adam Garcia John Goodman Melanie Lynskey Izabella Miko Bridget Moyhnahan and a cameo by LeAnn Rimes who actually is the singing voice of Perabo's character. Besides the four songs by Rimes the soundtrack is full of music by the likes of The Charlie Daniels Band Lenny Kravitz Def Leppard Blondie and Elvis Presley. Order another round and enjoy. This is actually worth seeing more than once.".

In order to make ends meet she takes a job slinging beer and dancing on the bar with the other Coyotes at the popular watering hole Coyote Ugly. This is very titilating and an eye full to watch. The trailers don't give you any hint of substance. Perabo is so easy to like. I could watch her for hours. Maria Bello who plays the bar owner is impressive as well. Also in the cast Adam Garcia John Goodman Melanie Lynskey Izabella Miko Bridget Moyhnahan and a cameo by LeAnn Rimes who actually is the singing voice of Perabo's character. Besides the four songs by Rimes the soundtrack is full of music by the likes of The Charlie Daniels Band Lenny Kravitz Def Leppard Blondie and Elvis Presley. Order another round and enjoy. This is actually worth seeing more than once.";

The songs performed by LeAnn Rimes and written by Diane Warren could not have been any better especially But I Do Love You.  The trailers although they are what made me want to see this film!!! mislead you greatly and I think that's why critics panned this film.

Tyra Banks was great even though I was waiting to see her more on the picture Maria Bello great performance and Piper Perabo should be taking more into account in Hollywood because she showed she also is a great actress and the music well what can I say this was really the chick flick of 2000 so congratulations!!!!!

I was surprised to see that it kept my attention throughout and had a few interesting side stories to keep the main plot fresh girl moves to big city.Many parts you knew were coming the breakin to her apartment her thinking of moving home her getting fired and given a second chance etc.  What saves this film are the bar scenes that the trailers have killed for the past 2 months.  You can't get enough of them and everyone knows there should have been more.  I've heard stories that the real Coyote Ugly in NYC is close to being as wild as the joint in the movie which makes me want to visit it sometime.   The biggest disappointment was the fact that Tyra Banks had basically NO part in the movie.  A quick 5 minute cameo in the beginning and that was it.  It's like Carmen Electra in the beginning of Scary Movie.  You want more but it's never there If you're still planning on seeing this movie go into knowing that you have seen this plot before and know that there won't be nearly enough bar scenes. Try to focus on the relationship with the main character's father and the movie seems much more interesting.Piper Parabo really grew on me.  She's very sweet and innocent but her acting has some minor flaws which need to be worked out.  Great date movie the women will like it as well as the men. Remember.....open minded!".

	schema:headline " Fun and snappy but too predictable with little depth";
	schema:reviewBody "Released in 2000 Coyote Ugly is a drama starring Piper Perabo as a singercomposer who leaves her home in nearby New Jersey with her dad John Goodman to try her hand at the music business in the big city. For money she gets a gig at a nightclub hotspot where the female workers dance on top of the bar for entertainment amongst other things like dumping ice on customers now and then spraying others with the soda gun and occasionally pouring liquor on the bar and setting it aflame Why Sure!. Maria Bello plays the owner of the bar while Adam Garcia plays the girl's potential beau.Perabo plays a thoroughly winsome heroine and the movie's fun with a kinetic soundtrack with for example Pour Some Sugar on Me playing twice. After the first act though the movie never really takes off and the story becomes predictably bland albeit still entertaining.While the movie wasn't a big hit it was moderately successful at the box office and has become a semiiconic film. A mere 2 years after its release I was in Las Vegas and there was an establishment called Coyote Ugly with an alluring woman dancing out front on a raised platform to draw in customers. That was my first exposure to Coyote Ugly and I asked my brotherinlaw about it to which he informed me it was a movie. One of the problems with the film is that the girl dancing out front of that Vegas nightclub was far more fetching than any of the actresses dancing in the movie. The women simply aren't curvy enough to engender much fascination. Perabo is arguably the best followed by blond cutie Izabella Miko but Miko and the rest e.g. Bridget Moynahan and Melanie Lynskey seriously looked like they needed to gain about 15 lbs. at least. But I suppose if you like women with the shape of 12 yearold boys you might appreciate this element more than me.Another problem is the emphasis on the nightclub lifestyle and the soused antics thereof. If bars are your thang then you'll probably favor this movie more than I did. Thankfully the protagonists eschew the drunkard lifestyle and the movie's to be commended for this the filmmakers obviously wanted to have their cake and eat it too.But those are minor quibbles. The biggest problem with Coyote Ugly beyond the story being predictable is that there's no meat on the bones so to speak. Take the subplot with the boyfriend and his big revelation scene it was underwhelming and weakly executed to say the least. Moreover I just saw the movie last night and I can't even remember if the protagonist makes it in the music business at the end. That's how forgettable the film is.A couple of years after the flick was released my wife asked a 9 yearold girl what her favorite movie was and she enthusiastically said Coyote Ugly! That tells you something about the film's depth.The picture runs 100 minutes and was shot in South Amboy New Jersey Atlantic Beach Long Island New York City and Tower Theatre  Ambassador Hotel Los Angeles.

	schema:reviewBody "Charles Dickens reputation did not need THE MYSTERY OF EDWIN DROOD to survive his death in 1870. He already had David COPPERFIELD GREAT EXPECTATIONS PICKWICK PAPERS BLEAK HOUSE OLIVER TWIST A Christmas CAROL A TALE OF TWO CITIES and seven or eight other titles to remind the world of his talents. But he was a very jealous man. He edited a magazine ALL THE YEAR ROUND and had been lucky enough to get his friend William Wilkie Collins to write a novel for it to be serialized. It was THE MOONSTONE. It became the best selling series of issues for the magazine  outstripping issues that had contained Dickens' novel OUR MUTUAL FRIEND. Dickens did not care for that.He had been accused of writing sensational novels by his critics. OLIVER TWIST was certainly a crime centered tale of gangs of youths trained to be thieves in London. Murders played parts in MARTIN CHUZZLEWIT BLEAK HOUSE A TALE OF TWO CITIES and OUR MUTUAL FRIEND. In his lesser fiction he had used characters based on real life poisoners Thomas Griffith Wainewright and Dr. William Palmer. But in all of his books Dickens used crime and criminal as an element not the central element of the story. He was a social critic and he had to notice crime as part of the social scene. Collins did this too but he centered his plots on the crimes in the stories. Dickens who could plot as well as Collins could not quite see how differently the two approached novel writing. So Dickens decided he would write one novel where the center would be the commission of a crime to wit the disappearance and probable murder of the title character Edwin Ned Drood. The novel's main figure would be Drood's young uncle and rival John Jasper. Both are in love with Rosa Bud the ward of the lawyer Hiram Grewgious. Jasper who is the choirmaster in an old cathedral town based on Canterbury is a secret opiun user. He loves his nephew and yet cannot avoid hating him as a rival for the young woman. But they are not the only rivals here. Ned Landless the brother of Helene Landless is a headstrong young man who is courting Rosa and it turns out he is actually the one she favors. There is a public scene between Landless and Drood in which Landless threatens his rival while a thoughtful Jasper looks on. Finally Rosa and Edwin have a talk and she firmly breaks off their engagement. Shortly afterwards Edwin Drood vanishes.Has he left to bury his wounded heart abroad? Has he met with an accident in which he has lost his memory or is injured and unable to get notice to his friends? Has he been killed in an accident? Has he committed suicide? Has he been murdered...and by whom? Jasper of course starts hinting broadly that his dear Ned has been murdered and the murderer is Neville Landless. Landless insists that he and Drood have made up their quarrel but there appears to be no witness to this. Jasper starts putting pressure on the local authorities led by a beautiful example of Dickensian bureaucratic stupidity Lord Mayor Thomas Sapsea to arrest Neville even though no body has been located. Neville flees.Jasper has the situation in his hand ... except that Neville's sister Helene does not trust him and she makes a smitten ally in a young naval officer Lieutenant Tartar. Grewgious also has his suspicions when Jasper faints when he hears from the lawyer that Edwin and Rosa had broken their engagement. Reverend Crisparkle the local clergyman keeps Rosa comforted  but he is worried because Neville's fleeing is not good for his reputation of being innocent. Then to add to Jasper's woes the old lady running the opium den he frequents known as the Princess Puffer shows up apparently looking into possible blackmail after she overhears something Jasper said about the missing Ned while under the drug. Similarly a stranger with a long white beard Dick Datcherly comes to town and is making many inquiries. He meets the Princess Puffer and he also meets Durdles the keeper of the local cathedral's burial grounds who tells him about Jasper's interest in quicklime and in the Sapsea memorial which is supposed to be empty.After completing about two thirds of EDWIN DROOD Dickens died suddenly. He left a literary puzzle that remains to perplex and bother his fans to this day. From my description it looks like he was aiming at Drood being murdered and the murderer being John Jasper. Most of the details that survive suggest that Edwin was not going to reappear. But was Neville to reappear? Or was he Datcherly or was Tartar or Grewgious Datcherly...or was Datcherly a new character in his own right  sent by Neville? Who would uncover the truth Datcherly Grewgious Neville Helene Rosa?In OLIVER TWIST the novel ended with a masterfully horror scene of Fagin in the death cell awaiting for his execution. Similar scenes were in BARNABY RUDGE and slightly changed in A TALE OF TWO CITIES. It has beens suggested that DROOD would have ended with Jasper in the death cell thinking about his crimes he may actually have ended up killing at least two other characters before the end and defending his conduct to his own satisfaction. If so it would have been a true masterpiece of detective fiction. Instead it survives as a perplexing fragment which many people including the actor Sir Felix Aylmer have tried to tear the secret out of.I saw the musical version of this in the 1980s which ironically enough starred George Rose  who would die by a planned murder within two years of my seeing him on stage. The musical concentrated on a whodunnit with audience participation. It was okay but missed the point that a detective story by Dickens had to be more than a whodunnit but a sensible piece of literary craftsmanship.This film is okay too. Douglas Montgomery a forgotten actor gave one of his best performances as Neville and Datcherly in this version. Rains is masterful as the moody and suspicious acting Jasper. One only wishes E.E.Clive were given more time to expand on the pompous Sapsea but he touches on him well. But the melodrama is pushed here not the treatment Dickens probably had in mind. As an entertainment I'd recommend it. As a dose of Dickens...read the fragment he left think about what I said and weep for what we lost.".

The stunning opening sequence depicting an opiuminduced hallucination is followed by the shocking discovery of the addict involved Claude Rains to be the choirmaster of the local church! Jealously in love with a girl Heather Angel about to marry his nephew David Manners in the title role he schemes to get the boy out of the way  unaware that the couple had mutually given each other up when she falls for hottempered newcomer Douglass Montgomery the latter's own shaky relationship with Drood leads to his being suspected of foul play when Manners goes missing  a situation Rains encourages for obvious reasons. Montgomery however does not rest on his laurels  indeed he makes himself up as an old man in order to conduct his own private investigation! The exciting climax  set inside the crypt so memorably utilized in the James Whale masterpiece I mentioned earlier  sees the villain engaged in a scuffle with the hero eventually getting his just desserts in melodramatic fashion. The film then serves as an interesting companion piece to contemporaneous Dickensian adaptations a starstudded David COPPERFIELD emerged from MGM that same year and should also pique the interest of horror buffs for the reasons I delineated at the start".

The stunning opening sequence depicting an opiuminduced hallucination is followed by the shocking discovery of the addict involved Claude Rains to be the choirmaster of the local church! Jealously in love with a girl Heather Angel about to marry his nephew David Manners in the title role he schemes to get the boy out of the way  unaware that the couple had mutually given each other up when she falls for hottempered newcomer Douglass Montgomery the latter's own shaky relationship with Drood leads to his being suspected of foul play when Manners goes missing  a situation Rains encourages for obvious reasons. Montgomery however does not rest on his laurels  indeed he makes himself up as an old man in order to conduct his own private investigation! The exciting climax  set inside the crypt so memorably utilized in the James Whale masterpiece I mentioned earlier  sees the villain engaged in a scuffle with the hero eventually getting his just desserts in melodramatic fashion. The film then serves as an interesting companion piece to contemporaneous Dickensian adaptations a starstudded David COPPERFIELD emerged from MGM that same year and should also pique the interest of horror buffs for the reasons I delineated at the start";

	schema:reviewBody "During the thirties film studios in Hollywood were going classics crazy. Even poverty row studios such as Monogram were having a go as they plundered literary classics and bought out their own versions of The Moonstone 1934 Jane Eyre 1934beautiful Virginia Bruce was Jane Eyre and Oliver Twist 1933 with Dickie Moore in the title role. It was only fitting that Universal home of the horror movie should tackle Mystery of Edwin Drood although at the time they could not afford such a costly production and with a plot involving murder violence and drug addiction it was one of Charles Dickens darkest novels. It was unfinished at the time of Dickens' death  he had only finished 6 chapters of a 12 chapter serialization and no attempt was made to finish it.It was an ideal story for Universal's latest sensation  an actor who was to excel in some splendidly malevolent roles  Claude Rains. Respected choir master John Jasper Claude Rains has a secret  he is an opium addict and his warped dreams are all about Rosa Budd Heather Angel. She has been engaged to Edwin Drood Ned David Manners since they were children and both of them are of the opinion that even though they feel only friendship toward each other they may as well marry. The thought of their marriage is driving Jasper insane.Helena Valerie Hobson and Neville Landless Douglass Montgomery brother and sister are surprise visitors to the village. They have come to England from Ceylon to study at Mr. Crisparkles but they have come out under a cloud. Neville has a violent temper and the reason they were sent to England is that Neville took a knife to his stepfather  after his sister was severely beaten by him. That night at a welcoming dinner Rosa faints  there is something about Jasper that repels her. Later that same night when Neville feels that Edwin is not speaking of Rosa with respect his temper gets the better of him and he draws a knife. Jasper who swears to keep the incident a secret sees a way of making trouble and spreads the story throughout the village giving Neville a reputation as hot tempered. Rosa and Ned have now called off their engagement but when they seal their friendship with a kiss Jasper sees them and jealously plots his revenge. Ned goes missing on the night of a fierce storm and Neville is bought in  he has just started a walking tour.This is just a terrific film and the ending concocted by scenarists John Balderston and Grace Unger met with universal approval from Dickens' fans who thought it remained faithful to the novel's original intentions. Even though many of the colourful characters were left out due to the film's shorter running time Francis L. Sullivan is a standout as Mr. Crisparkle. Although it is clear Jasper murdered Edwin finding out how he did it how the body was disposed and how he was found out will have you on the edge of your seat.If there was ever an actress who was born to play Victorian heroines it was Heather Angel  she was absolutely gorgeous as Rosa Budd even she makes a joke about the name in the film. I don't think Claude Rains was outshone by anyone in this film I thought he was simply fantastic but he was definitely given a run for his money by Douglass Montgomery who showed what he could do when given a role he could sink his teeth into. David Manners who had never worn the mantle of movie star comfortably was almost at the end of his career. Zeffie Tilbury gave a subdued performance as the Opium Woman  I was very surprised considering the only time I have ever seen her  she was mugging for all she was worth in the ghastly Mystery Liner 1934.Highly Recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Claude Rains a consistently great actor is reason enough to see any film. And Mystery of Edwin Drood is very good it does a noble job adapting an unfinished book and works very well on its own. It does have pacing issues and the ending is far too melodramatic. The stylised Gothic sets though are very striking and the film is filmed most handsomely and further advantaged by generous direction from Stuart Walker. The atmosphere evoked really does give off a sense of unease. The dialogue is easy to follow and is written while the story is tense and suspenseful. The film is short for a Dickens adaptation but the mystery is always involving and respects the book well with what they had to work with rather than disembowelling it. The characters are believable especially the tortured and creepy John Jasper. Claude Rains may have given better performances but he is still exceptional and from Rains you wouldn't expect any less. In fact all the cast acquits themselves well particularly Douglass Montgommery and Heather Angel. David Manners doesn't have as much to do but is also good. To conclude very good. 810 Bethany Cox".

What struck me most about Datcherly's appearance was his mannerisms and way of speaking the nose the long beard  I immediately recognized a striking resemblance to Fagin played by Alec Guinness in Oliver Twist 1946 as it was identical right down to the rasping voice. I'm sure Alec G. need only have taken one look at this characterization of Datcherly and he'd have found his clue to Fagin's appearance they are so much the same! The story moves along very well kept my interest no dull moments in my opinion. I was captivated by such a fine integrated performance from all the actors. It's my kind of movie!".

The unfinished 1870 story certainly begged for a proper solution baffling bibliophiles over the decades but this film's weakest flaw is that its depiction is fatally predictable. We are shown right away the drugaddled choirmaster John Jasper Claude Rains whose frequent illnesses are a mask for his addiction to opium a welcome touch seemingly missed by the Hays code. Jasper's secret desire for his lovely young ward Rosa Bud Heather Angel is clearly no surprise to her his piercing gaze sending her into paroxysms of fear and since she has been betrothed since childhood to Jasper's beloved nephew Edwin Drood David Manners evil thoughts begin to grow in the older man's mind. Enter Neville Landless Douglass Montgomery and his beautiful sister Helena Valerie Hobson recent arrivals from Ceylon allowing Jasper to foment an acrimonious rivalry over Rosa between the hot tempered Neville who has quickly fallen for her and her intended groom. There are precious few surprises in the script as written so it's up to the excellent cast to carry the day. With so many Dickensian characters surrounding him Claude Rains actually winds up in a subordinate role while Douglass Montgomery typecast in romantic parts relishes the opportunity for some real scenery chewing in disguise. Heather Angel had one future genre title ahead 1942's The Undying Monster while 17 year old Valerie Hobson was apparently Universal's busiest starlet of 1935 immediately rejoining director Stuart Walker on WereWolf of London along with Zeffie Tilbury Ethel Griffies Vera Buckland and J.

	schema:reviewBody "Dickens unfinished novel is given a plausible outcome in this Universal version of The Mystery of Edwin Drood. Made in the same year as two MGM classics by Dickens David Copperfield and Tale of Two Cities it may lack their production values but it does have a hauntingly dark performance from Claude Rains as well as a cart full of Dickens characters splendidly played by some London stage vets.Edwin Drood and Rosa Bud were engaged before they could talk but are more brother and sister than intendeds. His uncle John Jaspers the Church choirmaster and pillar of the community is obsessed with Rosa conversely he makes her skin crawl.

Made in the same year as two MGM classics by Dickens David Copperfield and Tale of Two Cities it may lack their production values but it does have a hauntingly dark performance from Claude Rains as well as a cart full of Dickens characters splendidly played by some London stage vets.Edwin Drood and Rosa Bud were engaged before they could talk but are more brother and sister than intendeds. His uncle John Jaspers the Church choirmaster and pillar of the community is obsessed with Rosa conversely he makes her skin crawl.

	schema:reviewBody "Above all else it was the promise of a hilariously young Claude Rains that prompted me to watch 'Mystery of Edwin Drood 1935' a Universal adaptation of Charles Dickens' final unfinished novel. Rains had of course appeared in Whales' 'The Invisible Man 1933' a few years earlier but curiously it was difficult to get a good look at him in that film so this was my main opportunity to catch the excellent supporting actor before he was forever condemned to playing greyhaired characters. His role here as John Jasper is completely unforgettable a riveting portrait of inner torment that communicates so much through every bodily twitch and strained facial expression. Just watch Rains as his character watches the beautiful Rosa through hungry agonised eyes  the pure anguish rippling through Jasper's body is almost painful to behold the image of a polluted mind and soul reaching the end of its tether. It's moments like this that made Rains one of the finest actors of Hollywood's golden age.The Mystery of Edwin Drood is itself one of literature's greatest mysteries. Left unfinished in 1870 after Dickens' death the story reaches no conclusion leaving scholars to ponder endlessly about how the author intended to wrap up the novel's events. The murderer of Edwin Drood if indeed he was ever murdered will thus never been known for sure. Stuart Walker's adaptation attempts to fill in these gaps as best as it can and this is accomplished quite well indeed. Despite the high potential for failure the story does feel as though it's flowing towards its logical conclusion and John Jasper's guilt ultimately seems the only practical option. Also a product of the screenwriters' imaginations was the identity of Dick Datchery a wheezing old stranger who arrives in town for a month or two  in the film he is the incognito Neville Landless determined to solve the mystery of Drood's disappearance though Dickens' story reaches no such conclusions. Though we can never know the author's true intentions these respectful suppositions are probably the best we're ever going to get.Claude Rains is clearly the film's standout performer giving a edgy and tortured performance as the tormented soul who in this version enacts his frustrations through strangulation. David Manners no stranger to Universal horror regulars is quite good as the titular murder victim though his character isn't all that interesting next to his deranged uncle. Douglass Montgomery with distinctive chiselled facial features plays the romantic lead with sufficient conviction and his interpretation of Datchery is enjoyable as well. I didn't recognise Heather Angel by sight but she's appeared in several films with which I'm quite familiar  Ford's 'The Informer 1935' and Hitchcock's 'Lifeboat 1944.' Her performance as Rosa Bud yeah I laughed too in 'Mystery of Edwin Drood' is perfectly serviceable given that it demands nothing except that she look beautiful  and she does. For fans of Charles Dickens fans of Claude Rains or fans of good oldfashioned storytelling this littleseen mystery drama is very much worth the effort it takes to track down.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mystery of Edwin Drood 1935 12 out of 4 This Universal film gets called by some one of their horror pictures but I think that's a tad bit off from the truth as it's certainly more melodrama. In the film Claude Rains plays an opium addicted choirmaster who falls in love with a woman Heather Angel who just happens to belong to his nephew David Manners. The woman is loved by a third man Douglass Montgomery willing to kill whoever gets in his way and soon the nephew goes missing. MYSTERY OF EDWIN DROOD is based on an unfinished novel by Charles Dickens. It was unfinished because the legend actually died while writing it so the ending here is something the screenwriter came up with on his own. The film isn't a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination but in the end I think it's way too slow and boring in parts and not to mention that it takes forever to really get going. The biggest problem is the pacing from director Stuart Walker who never really seems to get control of the film. It contains way too many slow spots and I think aspects of the drug usage was trimmed to avoid any trouble with the production code. Even the ending features a shot that seems to have been cut back but I won't ruin it. What keeps the film watchable is the performance by Rains who has no troubled playing the obsessed man and I think he's quite believable in the part. Manners Angel and Montgomery are also good in their parts and we also get to see Valerie Hobson who the same year was in BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN. Speaking of that James Whale classic this film shares many of the same sets which is fun for fans to spot.".

Clive and Forrester Harvey both from The Invisible Man and others one cannot help but assume this to be a horror film. Though there are no monsters nor mad scientists involved there is the frightening presence of an insanely jealous choirmaster who happens to be an opium addict Rains but its basically a story of jealousy and mystery story with a surprise twist.Set in 19th century England the story revolves around John Jasper Claude Rains a cathedral choirmaster of Cloisteram desperately in love with his music pupil Rosa Bud Heather Angel a beautiful girl just turned 18 engaged to marry his 21yearold nephew Edwin Ned Drood David Manners. Entering the scene are Neville Landless Douglass Montgomery and his sister Helena Valerie Hobson arriving from Ceylon on a carriage to live under the wing of the Rev. Mr. Crisparkle Francis L. Sullivan and his wife Louise Carter. Neville meets and immediately falls in love with Rosa which leads to heated anger and near fights between the two men. Neville finds Edwin's vanity intolerable and not worthy of Rosa's hand in marriage.

Realizing he is right in his assumption Edwin breaks his engagement to Rosa with Edwin and Neville later parting simply as friends.

Look quickly for Walter Brennan appearing briefly as the cockney town gossip. Claude Rains is perfectly cast in the lead as John Jasper the one whom Rosa Bud Heather Angel describes as one haunting her thoughts like a dreadful ghost. Much of the story rightfully belongs to Montgomery as the accused who goes to extreme measures to clear himself of a crime for which he is innocent. While Hobson has little to do as Angel's roommate and companion the story is also helped by the angelic beauty of Heather Angel and Edward Ward's stock background music.It's a wonder had Charles Dickens lived to complete his novel of The Mystery of Edwin Drood would he have come up with a surprise twist ending as depicted in this motion picture or something completely different? It's also a wonder how the 1914 silent screen adaptation to the same story was handled? Notably the novel had been completed and published in 1980 by another author over century after Dickens' death yet this climax itself is enough to indicate its satisfying conclusion.

Rosa and Edwin break their engagement based on the fact that they eventually realize that their marriage was their parents' dreams not their own. Earlier Jasper has announced his love to Rosa in a very creepy way and she is repulsed by his stalking. Jasper assumes that it is Edwin that is standing in his way and that night Christmas Eve Edwin Drood disappears before anybody can be told of his broken engagement. What happened to Edwin Drood? That is the mystery. Watch and find out.This thing is just a huge code buster all around  that is part of its allure. Although the wrongdoers are punished in the end the biracial love angle and the fact that there could be a hypocrite in a position of authority in the church violates the production code completely. There is also that great Universal Gothic atmosphere plus the acting is top notch. I highly recommend it.".

But it proves again one fact that has been well known for 150 years Charles Dickens was a heck of a storyteller.One of the foundation stones of mystery film making The Mystery of Edwin Drood still holds up in its mystery elements murder cemetery crypt fog etc.Claude Rains is bravura in a complex role. Sweetfaced Heather Angel Douglass Montgomery and David Manners provide fresh youthful energy. All of the performers bring Dickens' vivid characters to life.E.E.Clive gives one of his gemlike performances in a small part.

Not even kind of. It is perhaps I should have seen this coming a stodgy costume drama through and through. There are the most marginal of marginal horror elements. A murder a tomb some drug induced hallucinations a storm a creepy shadow cast on a wall. Despite the Victorian setting the movie totally lacks any foggy English atmosphere.It's not a bad movie though it is slow paced. Claude Rains gives an excellent performance as Uncle Jasper. The character as written could have been an obvious villain leeringly lusting after a girl twenty years younger then him an opium addict so clearly plotting revenge. However Rains makes him a real person. Though Rosa is disgusted by him A little unfairly his love for her is true his devotion sincere. He shows remorse for his action especially at the end. His decisions aren't calculated but rather rich with doubt. Rains' gravelly delivery is used extremely well. The rest of the cast too notably Douglass Montgomery as the accused boy who even makes the somewhat absurd old man disguise actually work. The girls seem like very stereotypical Victorian ladies at first but do eventually develop personalities. There's one really cool shot of a paper aging before our eyes showing the pass of time brilliantly. Otherwise? I can't say I was too horribly interested in this one.".

Several times in the first few minutes I'd contemplated turning it off as the film definitely started very slowly and felt a bit stilted. Fortunately it improvedand the final half hour was terrific. Stick with this one.The film begins with Mr. Jasper Claude Rains hanging out in an opium den! Yet when he leaves he assumes a very respectable veneer and few would suspect that he's a major screwball. No to outward appearances he's a respectable gentleman and the last anyone would suspect of wickedness few other than his niece that is. She thinks he's a creepy man who is casting lustful glances her way. And she's righthe wants her and in the worst way. However Rosa Bud yes that is the character's name! is engaged to marry Japser's nephewEdwin Drood. And when Drood disappears and Jasper begins telling everyone his nephew is dead suspicion falls on an innocent man Landless Douglass Montgomery. As the innocent man sees that the deck is stacked against him he disappears and only comes back later in disguisein order to investigate the crime himself. See the film to see what happens next.It seems that Charles Dickens died before he finished this his final story. But as people loved Dickens it's not surprising several film studios decided to finish his story and make the film. In this case it's never really in doubt that Rains was the killerbut in the book this was not the case. In fact there's good evidence to suggest that Dickens had intended for Drood to returnalive and in one piece! But even if this isn't Dickens' vision the folks at Universal did weave a good storyand the best was the latter portion that Dickens did NOT put on paper. Well done all aroundwith a particularly noteworthy performance by Montgomerywho oddly did much better in his alterego than when he was playing a normal character! A few things to look for in the film include the ridiculously melodious voice coming out of Rains when he sang which obviously is NOT his Will Geer in a tiny role as a lamplighter 53 minutes into the movie and the lovely sets which were recycled from the latest Frankenstein movie!! Well worth seeing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Recently we have noticed an increasing trend in multinational productions featuring short films by several directors. For example we have Three Three Extremes Eros and the BMW Films. Actually such practice was not uncommon in Europe in the 60s the difference is that Asian directors were overlooked back then with the possible exception of Japanese directors and are now usually at the forefront of these films.ABOUT LOVE is a 3part romantic film featuring the talent of China Japan and Taiwan  although the names would not be as famous as the directors of Three Extremes. In each short film there is a He and a She and one is always Japanese the other Chinese. All 3 are highly evocative although each part evokes distinct emotions.The first short film is an upbeat fairytale from Ten Shimoyama St. John's Wort. In Tokyo the story begins with a woman Michiko receiving a phone call from Tecchan while going through her daily wandering in the midst of 20 million people. It has been 1320 hours since her boyfriend failed to return and her boyfriend just ended their 3year relationship with a 4 second phone call. She finds comfort from a Chinese student Chen Bolin of BLUE GATE CROSSING who posts drawings on her door drawings of her gradually recovering. This part is short and sweet filled with the wonderful nightscape of Chen Bolin riding through Tokyo in solitude. The super evocative music perfectly complements the imagery.One word to describe part 1 Fairytale. 1010The second segment actually precedes the first part in terms of time line. In Taipei unable to sleep a woman spends all night pounding nails into a bookshelf to release her frustration. She calls Tecchan whose voice we hear in part 1 on the phone to come over. She doesn't speak Japanese while his Chinese proficiency is probably 5 but that doesn't stop them from attempting to communicate. In the hands of Yee Chinyen dir BLUE GATES CROSSING this part has a more experimental style featuring super lengthy takes and notsosmooth cuts. The style along with the emotionally unstable and disillusioned protagonist are bordering Wong Kar Wai territory. The most memorable scene from the movie can be found in this segment in a 3minute scene he tries to deliver her a message in Chinese. They go back and forth decoding the exact message full of repetition but she knows that he is just trying to make her feel better he is helping her to keep the last inch of hope alive. The result is both hilarious esp if you know the Chinese language and heartfelt. For those who have seen BLUE GATES CROSSING it's the equivalent of the lengthy chairpushing scene but here the repetition is even more striking.This segment illustrates the impossibility to let go and what one can do to fill the emptiness. The main characters' complexity are also the strongest here. Feelings of loss missing incomplete dependency vulnerability longing are inevitable. 910 I took off one point for his not only frustrating but also irritating attempt at speaking Chinese. It goes beyond believable sometimes Our last stop is Shanghai. The life of working class girl YunYun has been lacking until the arrival of a Japanese teacher. Instead of going to school she is working as cashier at her home store and studying at home. At some point he stole her heart but he is too busy fulfilling his dream for which he came to Shanghai to notice. His exgirlfriend also waited for him but she realized it was only his dream not hers. For YunYun love hurts. One year later he returns to Shanghai to finally discover the true love that he missed. And yet the walls of YunYun's family residence has been crumbled the neighborhood nonexistent. In the midst of 10 million people how can he find this girl whose heart he melted and finally grant her the comfort of being in his arms? One word summary for segment 3 poignant. 810 3 flavors of love 3 unforgettable experiences. Romance doesn't get much better than ABOUT LOVE.".

While the three stories which take place in three Asian cities are loosely linked they are nowhere comparable in complexity to the essentially interlocking stories in 21 Grams. As the matter of fact the links are not at all necessary as the stories are independently intact. The links I suppose are put there to extract the ooh's and aah's from people who dig such things. Nor is the structure anywhere near the brilliance of Amores Perros.Although the title is About Love the stories touch more on the prelove sentiments sometimes called infatuation that delicate click that starts a bitter sweet relationship which in time may or may not blossom into love. Equally interesting as my summary line suggests is that aspect of cultural and language barrier that is quite similar to what we see in Japanese Story. Here however the gap is smaller as the encounters are within Asian cultures in each case between two young people one Chinese and one Japanese. In all three cases one of the two is going through a tough period after a breakup. Each story however has its own unique flavor.In Tokyo he is a Chinese computer graphic artist seeking to enrich his exposure while she is a Japanese painter struggling to recover from a broken relationship. This is the simplest and sweetest of the three stories starting with hidden mutual attraction and ending in their first meeting. This is also the only one of the three stories with a subplot a really glorified use of the term of his friendship with two other art students both girls one Chinese and one Japanese.In Taipei she is a local girl suffering from a broken heart and he is a Japanese visitor she asks in the middle of the night to help putting up a wall unit. This is the only story with a scene of brief libido drive which however quickly subsides. The rest of the story is on his helping her by asking her exboyfriend whether there is a chance of getting back together. Among the three this is the story that plays most on the language barrier thing with some absolutely hilarious scenes resulting.In Shanghai he is a Japanese student renting a room from her mother. She probably has a crush on him at first sight but keeps it deeply hidden when she sees how devoted he is to his girlfriend. But when he gets a postcard from the girlfriend ending their relationship her attraction to him intensifies although she never reveals it. This is the most poignant of the three stories. Romance aside this story also takes a quick jab at the maddening scene of urban development of Shanghai.This thoughtful film by three capable Asian directors should not fail to delight even if not enthrall.Starring In Tokyo  Ito Misaki Chen Bolin In Taipei  Kase Ryo Mavis FanIn Shanghai  Tsukamoto Takashi Li XiaoluDirectors Shimoyama Ten Yee Chihyen Zhang Yibai".

	schema:reviewBody "Just to clarify any accusation of me being stereotypical I am a Chinese born in Shanghai. I moved to Canada when I was 8 and for the next decade I followed the Chinese cinema with diminishing enthusiasm. Its probably because of the pathetic profitability due to piracy Chinese movies suffer from lack of originality and depth. In the romance genre its almost always about love triangle shy girls and guys rebellion against family and etc. Lately I have spread my horizon towards other Asian films namely Korean. Films like One Fine Spring Day Il Mare Christmas in August Harmonium in My Dream all have a single important property implicity. These films fully utilizes silence gesture quiet background music and scenery to illicit a quiet understanding of what the character is feeling. Now finally China catches onto this new trend much unlike the Hollywood's CGI 20 million salary actors and explosions. Now about the movie each story is unique in its own ways and together compliments each other. Possible SpoilerTokyo  This is story that trades affection for passion. There is no steamy love scene. Instead it present a companionship. The guy is alone in a 20 million people city barely able to communicate. The girl suffers from a recent breakup. Unique feature The photos taken showing the two people constantly close but never meeting each other. The flip papers very original.TaiPei  Although this story contains passion it is ultimately about companionship if not friendship. As the story progress you can really feel the torment in the girl. The insomnia the rebound the desperation of getting back together is perfect. Many firms would have overdone it. The guy's understanding and his determination to help is both touching and hilarious. Unique feature the comic relief of their dance the tunnel scene.Shanghai  Since this is my hometown it has a very special place in my heart. The laundries along the street the bickering of the mother and the wasteland caused a sea of memories to rush back. The secret love of this story is extremely subtle and overwhelming. The girl's attention to detail tone of her voice and since this is probably her first love it is very innocent. Of the three male actors in the three stories the guy in this story may be weakest character. His breakup is not nearly as powerful as the prior two. Unique features The goodbye btw the girl and guy the reattachment of the letterwhich I am amazed that the guy did not find suspicious considering she asked him to translate and the streetamazing that the filming crew could find place so quiet and undisturbed by modernization in Shanghai.".

Now finally China catches onto this new trend much unlike the Hollywood's CGI 20 million salary actors and explosions. Now about the movie each story is unique in its own ways and together compliments each other. Possible SpoilerTokyo  This is story that trades affection for passion. There is no steamy love scene. Instead it present a companionship. The guy is alone in a 20 million people city barely able to communicate. The girl suffers from a recent breakup. Unique feature The photos taken showing the two people constantly close but never meeting each other. The flip papers very original.TaiPei  Although this story contains passion it is ultimately about companionship if not friendship. As the story progress you can really feel the torment in the girl. The insomnia the rebound the desperation of getting back together is perfect. Many firms would have overdone it. The guy's understanding and his determination to help is both touching and hilarious. Unique feature the comic relief of their dance the tunnel scene.Shanghai  Since this is my hometown it has a very special place in my heart. The laundries along the street the bickering of the mother and the wasteland caused a sea of memories to rush back. The secret love of this story is extremely subtle and overwhelming. The girl's attention to detail tone of her voice and since this is probably her first love it is very innocent. Of the three male actors in the three stories the guy in this story may be weakest character. His breakup is not nearly as powerful as the prior two. Unique features The goodbye btw the girl and guy the reattachment of the letterwhich I am amazed that the guy did not find suspicious considering she asked him to translate and the streetamazing that the filming crew could find place so quiet and undisturbed by modernization in Shanghai.";

	schema:reviewBody "Many critics and fans love this movie the best of all Hemingway stories on film perhaps. I think this film is so because it is honest somewhat autobiographical and derived from a splendid and mature short story of enduring fame. The plot line of the film is simple. In a fever because of an accident Harry lies perhaps dying tended by his third wife in a camp in Africa. His delirium causes him through a long night spent waiting for help to arrive to relive in his mind the triumphs disappointments sorrows loves and moments of his somewhat unsatisfactory life as an author. He is bitter and takes it out on his wife but he does not KNOW that he is going to dieso he continues to pester ask questions make demands and study the reverie in his thoughtswhich viewers see as extended flashbacks. As Harry Street Gregory Peck is mostly very good indeed exactly right for the role not of Hemingway but of a man who had lived what the author describes in the storyline. As the wives Hildegarde Neff is cold beautiful and skilled showing us how she tried to control Harry and protesting that she had loved him as much as she could. The first wife Ava Gardner plays her part admirably as a young notimportant woman who wants domesticity not excitement as Harry does wrecks their union to have a child and drinks herself to death. The third wife played amiably and with intelligence by Susan Hayward seems almost the product of Harry's training. And if finally she has come to understand accept and even want his way of life we assume that finally all will be well at the end. The medical help arrives and Harry will live to write more he wants in fact very much to live again. There are amazingly enjoyable scenes in this bigappearing filmbullfights a wartime scene Mediterranean yachts and villas Paris and Kenya and more. it is beautiful moving and often thoughtprovoking. Also in the cast are veterans Torin Thatcher Leo G. Carroll and Marcel Dalio all doing superbly. Henry King directed Casey Robinson wrote the script and Leon Shamroy provided stunningly beautiful cinematography. Harry may feel in the film that he has compromised something to become a success but he still talks about the snow leopard once found frozen on Mt. Kilimanjaro at 18000 feet. He wonders what the leopard was seeking at that altitudeHemingway's and Harry's parable for human mental curiosity and the sometimes perverse desire to invest much to achieve eventual greatness. The film may not quite measure up to this famous conception but it is grand in mental scale and interesting throughout.".

Perhaps there is a clean one out there somewhere but I haven't seen it. And after watching the film all the way through something I have attempted unsuccessfully before on several occasions I could see why no one bothered to protect the copyright on this film. While it isn't exactly bad it's so dull and uninspired that I am sure nobody even cared to worry about royalties! Now think about it...the film stars Gregory Peck Ava Gardner and Susan Hayward and is based on the tumultuous life of Ernest Hemmingway and it still is very dull in places and at best an ordinary film though I won't be that generous. So why is it such a disappointment? Well the biggest problem was just how cheap the film looked. The location scenes clearly look like they were filmed by a second unit without the stars and the closeup scenes appear as if they were poorly staged in front of filmed footage. While I might expect this sort of sloppiness from an old onereel comedy I don't expect it from a bigbudget film with top Hollywood talent. It really looked as if they spent too much on the stars and had nothing left to make the film! The other problem was that although Hemingway led a very adventurous life and traveled the world once you dig beneath the exterior you are left with a pretty rotten person who isn't exactly cuddly and endearing. While his devoted friends and fans probably will care whether Peck survives his injury I found I just didn't particularly careas the character Peck played didn't carenor did I. And what you are left with are a long series of mildly interesting of flashbacks that tell about the author. The only way the film really works is as a psychological studynot as entertainment.".

	schema:headline " Soso film that is never as complex or as tragic as it should have been and is a lot less interesting for it";
	schema:reviewBody "Having saved a young man from a hippo writer Harry Street lies dying from an infection in his African safari campsite. As his unappreciated wife Helen tends to his wounds and ensures him everything will be alright Harry sinks into feverish reminiscing about a life that he perceives as being a failure in terms of both writing and his love life. He recalls the one woman that he believes he truly loved which helpfully for Helen isn't his current wife but a woman called Cynthia Green whom he met in Paris. The more he recalls the deeper his depression and the more Helen watches him surrendering his fight and will to live.Taking a deathbed flashback structure we always know that things between Harry and his other loves didn't work out and the only question is why. On paper we are meant to be with a bitter angry man who is facing death with a superficial devilmaycare attitude but underneath carries a deep sense of regret. The first problem I encountered with the film was that the script didn't carry this off very well at all and I wasn't convinced about the supposed years of failure that are stacked on top of Harry  people with such things have much more baggage than came out here. The flashbacks are reasonable interesting but are closer to melodrama than a searing tale of regret and loss which personally I thought it should have been. The film does flit around the world which must have been a selling point for it at the time of release but it doesn't actually add much to the story or characters other than providing a different background for some scenes.King's direction is fairly workmanlike he enjoys the locations but the mix of his footage with stock footage doesn't sit well together  I know it is a limitation of the period but it still doesn't work. Peck is solid enough in the lead but he does the superficial things and doesn't get to grips with anything deeper or more complex. He gets no help from Hayward who is watching her husband long for women past but never appears to have any problem with this whatsoever. Gardner is pretty but again she doesn't convince in her character when asked to do anything more seeing her in the middle of the Spanish civil war was pretty funny as well. Support from Leo G Carroll is always welcome but he doesn't have much to work with here.Overall this is a soso film that never fulfils its potential or is as engaging as it should have been. Instead of being complex and full of pain it is melodramatic and soapy instead of being about the tragic souls of the characters it seems to have as much interest in stock footage and global locations. The cast give solid but superficial performances in response to this and the film never really gets a handle on any of it.".

	onyx:emotionText "Having saved a young man from a hippo writer Harry Street lies dying from an infection in his African safari campsite. As his unappreciated wife Helen tends to his wounds and ensures him everything will be alright Harry sinks into feverish reminiscing about a life that he perceives as being a failure in terms of both writing and his love life. He recalls the one woman that he believes he truly loved which helpfully for Helen isn't his current wife but a woman called Cynthia Green whom he met in Paris. The more he recalls the deeper his depression and the more Helen watches him surrendering his fight and will to live.Taking a deathbed flashback structure we always know that things between Harry and his other loves didn't work out and the only question is why.

	schema:reviewBody "The interesting characters and some good performances are what keep this adaptation of Ernest Hemingway's The Snows of Kilimanjaro going. Many of the story details reflect the movie's source although it has a heavier slower tone instead of Hemingway's own economical style of writing. The scenes of hunting bullfighting and combat all fit in with Hemingway's fascination with vigorous action and the screenplay does make some use of Hemingway's 'leopard riddle' but not with any significant depth. Instead it does have a lot of photography of African scenery and wildlife which is good in itself.Gregory Peck gives his usual effective performance in the lead role as Harry a jaded writer who reflects on his past loves as he suffers through the effects of a dangerous injury. Peck fleshes out the character believably alternating between the writer's energetic but flawed personality in the flashbacks and his increasing delirium in the present. It's a different kind of role for Peck and he thus adapts his style somewhat from that of his more well remembered roles.Ava Gardner and Susan Hayward along with Hildegarde Neff in a smaller part portray the women in Harry's past and present. Gardner's ethereal elegance makes a nice contrast with Hayward's stronger screen persona and Neff's characterization is a believable depiction of the unsuitable woman whom Harry finds during a time of despair.The characters and the African atmosphere are the parts of the movie that work the best and they make it worth seeing. It moves rather slowly and occasionally expends screen time on less interesting material or otherwise it might have been more compelling. It still leaves you with a thoughtful impression of its main characters.".

True the story is based on an essentially unsympathetic character...but there seems to be no message or point to telling the story of the wasted life of a writer who finally realizes how much frittered away his energy on meaningless definitions of success. But even that message is carried poorly in the film. The women are all onedimensional and overlydevoted to Harry who basically drinks and throws himself into any adventure to distract himself from important writing. There is a lot of excess footage. Uninteresting and long takes of hyenas walking around. Vultures in trees. Musicians playing soullessly... the film is a sad waste of talent and time.The story... if you can call it that unfolds as a plodding series of flashbacks while Harry lies fevered on a cot in Africa suffering from gangrene.The fetid stench of his leg draws the attention of vultures which foreshadow his demise as well as a hyena that seems to laugh at his condition rotting from the inside out. The title of the film alludes to a riddle of why a leopard carcass might be found on top of a tall mountain with snow. But Harry's answer is some poorly recorded mumbling about getting back to the jungle which makes no sense. It would have been simple to say that the leopard perished trying to travel where he is not made to go... achieving pointless heights. Or even a romantic justification could be offered the leopard seeks his mate but he cannot find her anywhere and begins to look in places where she cannot be in sheer desperation to quench his longing for her. But no. The filmmakers saved the literary license for the ending of the film where a rescue is implied. The film suggests that he lives but it is a delusion of Harry's that any plane ever arrives.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS Long and tiring movie that chronicles the life and times of world renowned writer and big game hunter Harry Street Gregory Peck. We get the story straight from the horses Harry himself mouth as he lay dying on a sickbed in the African bush country from a gangrenous infection. This happened when Harry jumped into a river trying to save one of the natives who fell in that was a member of his safari. Harry if anything was more responsible then the herd of hippos that attacked and killed the native by having the boat go too close to the hippos in order for him to get some pictures. Helen Susan HaywerdHarry's wife who's on the safari with him could only hope and pray for help in the way of medical supply to arrive in order to save his life. As Harry goes in and out of consciousness we get to see his life story through his thoughts and feelings and how his cold and selfish personality just about destroyed every relationship that he ever had including the love of his life Cynthia Ava Gardner. Harry met Cynthia Green in Paris when he was a poor and struggling young writer as they lived together in a one room flat that he had in the poor side of town.As Harry got famous through the books that he wrote he became more and more detached from Cynthia that left her hurt and dejected. Finding out from her doctor that she's with child Cynthia tried to give the good news to Harry hoping that it would bring them both back together. Harry was so cold and unfeeling and at the same time so in to himself when Cynthia was about to announce the coming blessed event to him that not only did she drop the whole subject but fell or jumped down a flight of stairs causing her to have a miscarriage! Harry after recovering from the shock of Cynyhina's accident and loss of her and his unborn child still treated Cynthia more or less like dirt being too stuck up on his own importance to the literary world in the books and article he wrote to really care about her. Cynthia became so disgusted of him and the way he acted toward her that one evening she just got up and walked out on Harry as he was munching on a bowl of veggies. Cynthia did that by leaving Harry for a dancer who was preforming at a restaurant that they were dining at. Harry went on his way to become more famous in the world of books and big game hunting and continued to have more and more affairs with beautiful women like Cynthia who were more or less one night stands to him. But the spark was gone from his life with Cynthia no longer being with him. Like joining the French Foreign Leagion Harry joined the fight against Fascism in Spain to forget what he did to Cynthia and it was there that Harry was to unexpectedly find her! Cynthia also joined the antiFacists fighters there where Harry found her dying after she was crushed by the ambulance that ran over a land mine that she was driving as a volunteer! It in a way did bring out the best as well as human side of Harry when she forgave him for everything that he did to her and he showed real emotions for the first time as she practically died in his arms. Harry then forgot himself and ran the opposite way on the battlefield after the stretcher bearers who were carrying away his beloved Cynthia. It's then that he was shot and wounded by an officer in his unit thinking that he was a coward and deserting his post! By now nothing seems to be going right for him. Even though Harry later married he never forgot the beautiful as well as tragic Cynthia and never forgave himself even though she did for what he did to her. Back to the present in Africa in the shadows of the majestic 19710 foot high Mt.Kilimanjaro Harry waits for the enviable and as all hope is just about gone for him surviving he still manages to pull a rabbit out of his hat. With darkness falling and Harry in all probability never to see the sunrise again there's still one more surprise that fate or the script writers have left for him in the movie that's coming Harry's way and this time for once it won't be all that bad. Very dull and boring movie that seemed to go on forever and ever more with Harry going through all the stages that one would go through from life to death as he's slowly dying right before our eyes. I myself felt as if I was attending his funeral without him yet being dead. The script writers just should have let Harry die peacefully instead of having the unbelievably ridicules ending that concluded the film. I don't know for sure since I didn't read the book that if the ending in the movie to Snows of Kilimanjaro was the same as the one in the Earnest Hemingway short story. But I do know that it was one of the worst endings I've ever seen in a film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ernest Hemingway one of the most admired writers of the last century was alive when this movie came out in 1952. One wonders what did Mr. Hemingway think the creative 'geniuses' behind this film did to The Snows of Killimanjaro? Hollywood didn't do so well in adapting Papa's novels to the screen but who knows he must have been able to pay for another safari to Africa or maybe another fishing trip with the old man in Cuba with the money he got after he sold the film's rights. As a novel The Snows of Killimanjaro was not one of Mr. Hemingway's best works.God only knows that what director Henry King and his team had in mind when they undertook to do the film based on Hemingway's novel? Maybe Mr. King wanted to travel to all the places in which the action is set. The only thing one can say is that after more than fifty years this wasn't a good film then or now.The acting is bad in general.

	onyx:emotionText "Ernest Hemingway one of the most admired writers of the last century was alive when this movie came out in 1952. One wonders what did Mr. Hemingway think the creative 'geniuses' behind this film did to The Snows of Killimanjaro? Hollywood didn't do so well in adapting Papa's novels to the screen but who knows he must have been able to pay for another safari to Africa or maybe another fishing trip with the old man in Cuba with the money he got after he sold the film's rights. As a novel The Snows of Killimanjaro was not one of Mr. Hemingway's best works.God only knows that what director Henry King and his team had in mind when they undertook to do the film based on Hemingway's novel? Maybe Mr. King wanted to travel to all the places in which the action is set. The only thing one can say is that after more than fifty years this wasn't a good film then or now.The acting is bad in general. Gregory Peck an otherwise brilliant actor does nothing to bring Harry Street to life. The Helen of Susan Hayward is at times horrible and completely silly. Ava Gardner's as a driver for the Republican forces in the Spanish Civil War? Give me a break!

Hemingway's deceptively simple style of prose belied an understanding of human nature at odds with the macho exterior Papa presented to the world and whether intentional or not this film manages to capture something of Hemingway's style while largely failing in terms of dramatic content.Much of the blame for this lies in a treatment which is inadequate to the scope of the story it attempts to relate. Largely  if not wholly  based on Hemingway's own life experiences the film fails to capture the bluff largerthanlife essence of the man. This is largely down to a poor choice of leading man in Gregory Peck. For my money Peck was never more than a pretty face and possessed an extremely limited talent. He's certainly not up to the demands made of him by the character of Harry Street worldtravelling writer lover and heavy drinker whose material success is tempered by a feeling of failure both artistically and emotionally.Also culpable though are the shoddy standards with regards to the location shooting  secondunit only so all the actors travelled no further than to the Fox backlot in Hollywood. This means we see Peck lying on his 'deathbed' on what is obviously a stage set gazing out at a group of vultures perched in anticipation on a tree in the shadows of the eponymous mountain. This is so distracting that it destroys all semblance of verisimilitude.Add to that possibly the world's worst death scene  Ava Gardner does her 'woman driver' bit in the midst of a Spanish Civil War battlefield and prays for the lost love of her life to come find her only for  guess what  the love of her life to find her. Her death also is badly botched occurring offscreen and referred to only once in passing afterwards.Despite all this the film still does manage to be fairly absorbing while never scaling the heights its producers were obviously aiming for.".

	schema:headline " What were they doing at that altitude that made them make such a bad movie?";
	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the worst directed worst written and worst acted movies I have ever seen. Everything about it shouts I'm just too lazy to think of anything better to do with this material and it really shows. With a story that cries out for subjective camera treatment and creative transitions to the lengthy feverish flashbacks Henry King opts for the least inspired choices possible. He cuts awkwardly from past to present with no unifying metaphor no introspective ownership of the recollections or the triggers that brought them to the fevered mind of Harry Street. His camera is shockingly static. Entire scenes are filmed in lockeddown medium distance two shots with nary a sympathetic reaction shot or closeup to give the actors a chance to do something up close and personal. Was he on too tight a schedule to afford the simplest of additional setups?The socalled beauty shots are nothing more than runofthemill step off the tour bus and take a snapshot caliber. They do not deserve the accolades they fetched in 1952. National Georgraphic was already doing better. The nature sequences are shot in different light than the film's continuity with different film stock and seem to be stock footage which a cheap assistant producer purchased and edited in. The acting is clueless. Gregory Peck is badly miscast as the obnoxious irresponsible writer Harry Street. He doesn't do cynicism or worldweariness well and he plays a drunk very unconvincingly. Half the time you get the feeling he can't wait for the take to be over. He was not having fun and he definitely did not rise to the challenge. He had no clue how to portray a writer and he had no idea how a writer might die under ironic circumstances.The script was laughable at times dropping in Hemingwayesque lines that were at odds with the speech patterns the writer had established. It was a bad script. And it had the smell of badness. But the writer couldn't smell it. And he was a bad writer. But he wrote the move anyway. And it was a bad movie. And its smell was bad.The only redeeming scene in the whole movie was the portrait of Rue Mouftard where Leonard and Betsy have their little apartment in Paris and where H'way lived. It was lovingly portrayed by someone who knew the quarter and knew how to photograph it.So there you are. Don't bother renting this film unless you want to run a seminar on bad movie making.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is one of the worst directed worst written and worst acted movies I have ever seen. Everything about it shouts I'm just too lazy to think of anything better to do with this material and it really shows. With a story that cries out for subjective camera treatment and creative transitions to the lengthy feverish flashbacks Henry King opts for the least inspired choices possible. He cuts awkwardly from past to present with no unifying metaphor no introspective ownership of the recollections or the triggers that brought them to the fevered mind of Harry Street. His camera is shockingly static. Entire scenes are filmed in lockeddown medium distance two shots with nary a sympathetic reaction shot or closeup to give the actors a chance to do something up close and personal. Was he on too tight a schedule to afford the simplest of additional setups?The socalled beauty shots are nothing more than runofthemill step off the tour bus and take a snapshot caliber. They do not deserve the accolades they fetched in 1952. National Georgraphic was already doing better. The nature sequences are shot in different light than the film's continuity with different film stock and seem to be stock footage which a cheap assistant producer purchased and edited in.

However if we look at this film from a technical aspect it has a lot to recommend. I loved the colours in the film especially the blues of the skies. They are bright and filled me with nostalgia.Furthermore the way the story is told is great. We are told of Peck's love life through a series of flashbacks. The actual tale itself is drawn out but some moments make it worth the ride. The tragedy of Peck's character is one many people can relate to the artist pursues his art but neglects the emotions he speaks so highly of.Peck and Gardner are great as the leading roles. Peck sometimes mumbles his lines but that is part and parcel of his charm in the film. Susan Hayward is great as the neglected wife.This film does have moments of brilliance. It has some heart breaking moments but it is fleshed out by some unbelievable events and bum choices by the director. I couldn't help but feel that the THEMES capital letters everyone were slapped on a little too heavily sometimes. Sure we can be shown reasons of Harry's tragic downfall but does it have to be spelt out for us? I think the director should have left some of the thoughts and memories for the audience to think of.Still a good film with wonderful colour and some great tearjerker moments. Worth a watch.".

	schema:headline " Not just a prison film but an excellent film about not being able to conform in a world that requires it";
	schema:reviewBody "Having had the advantage of reading Donn Pearce's novel about a year before seeing Cool Hand Luke it was with great anticipation that I awaited it's transfer to the big screen.  I was not disappointed.Cool Hand Luke could easily be classified by the misguided as just a prison yarn but it is so much more than that.  It is the story of a man who refuses to be nailed down or conform to the rules and regulations of a society that he has never craved to fit into.  When Lucas Jackson is arrested for cutting heads off parking meters his explanation to the prison captainStrother Martin is Small Town not much to do in the evening which would have us believe he was just being drunk and stupid.  Later to one of the other inmates he mutters the same answer but importantly adds just settlin some old scores.  It is a brief but important point in helping to define the character of Luke beyond just being drunk and damaging public property.  As a service man we also discover that Luke won a bronze star achieved the rank of sergeant but came out as a private.  Again early evidence that Luke is unable to conform to any body's rules but his own. Yet we are given clear evidence that Luke knows what is right in principal and what is wrong.  At one point in the film when they are putting Luke in the box under less than reasonable circumstances he tells the boss calling it your job don't make it right Boss.  In a visit from his mother ArlettaJo Van Fleet Luke says plenty about his own character by telling her A man's got to go his own way or as he also puts it I tried to live always free and above board like you but I can't seem to find no elbow room. As Luke enters the prison that will supposedly be his home for the next two years we meet the other inmates.  Some of them wear chains some of them do not.  It is a point early in the film that director Stuart Rosenberg emphasizes.  We understand quickly that sooner or later you conform.    You either walk the line the way the bosses tell you to or they will find the means to get you to walk the line.  As the Captain reiterates for your own good you'll learn the rules A point driven home often.What we discover about their crimes is minuscule.  One is jailed for manslaughter after hitting a pedestrian with his car another is a paper hanger another new inmate is charged with breaking entering and assault. The nature of their crimes is unimportant to us.  It enables to view these prisoners as men and while we don't feel any genuine sympathy for them feeling disgusted by their crimes would have been a distraction from the true purpose of Pearce's story and Luke as the focal point.Because of his individuality it doesn't take Luke long before he unexpectedly becomes a hero to the other inmates.  It is not a role he chooses or even wants.  It unexpectedly imposes the burden on him of having to live up to the expectations of others.  He never truly understands the nature of this hero worship and would be just as happy if he didn't have to deal with it.  He is still trying to find his way in the world and if there is any real purpose for his existence.Another principal character is DraglineGeorge Kennedy.  It is he who finally establishes the fact that Cool Hand Luke is a man who can not be beaten.  Dragline's admiration for Luke seems to extend from the fact that heDraglinehas learned the rules on how to get by but yet regrets having lost some of his own individuality in the process.  He is the rest of the inmates in microcosm.  I can't remember a role that George Kennedy has ever been better in and he deservedly won the best supporting actor award.Cool Hand Luke is not without it's humorous moments especially in the  early going.  It is these moments that help move the film from the early stages to the darker more despairing later stages.  Perhaps for that reason alone we are even more effected by Luke's dilemma.In translating his novel to the screen Donn Pearce along with Frank Pierson has managed to bring the heart and soul of his nove to the big screen.  Lalo Shifrin's memorable score emphasizes often the repeated drudgery of working on the chain gang.  Director Stuart Rosenberg made more good films after Cool Hand Luke but in my opinion never achieved the same degree of perfection that he does here.   As Cool Hand Luke Paul Newman give one of the most memorable performances in a long distinguished career.  It is not an easy task portraying a man who travels the road from being a sincere individualist to a man who may be beaten and defeated yet in the end is still unwilling to accept that fate. Although Rod Steiger won the best actor award that year one could argue that Newman's role was more difficult as it required substantially different subtle ranges in character.  As for the failure of Cool Hand Luke to achieve a Best Picture nomination I'm at a loss to explain that malfunction especially when the likes of Doctor Doolittle and Guess Who's Coming To Dinner far lesser efforts than this were nominated.Cool Hand Luke is a true classic in every sense of the word.  It is a film that will long be remembered.My grade A".

	onyx:emotionText "Having had the advantage of reading Donn Pearce's novel about a year before seeing Cool Hand Luke it was with great anticipation that I awaited it's transfer to the big screen.  I was not disappointed.Cool Hand Luke could easily be classified by the misguided as just a prison yarn but it is so much more than that.  It is the story of a man who refuses to be nailed down or conform to the rules and regulations of a society that he has never craved to fit into.  When Lucas Jackson is arrested for cutting heads off parking meters his explanation to the prison captainStrother Martin is Small Town not much to do in the evening which would have us believe he was just being drunk and stupid.  Later to one of the other inmates he mutters the same answer but importantly adds just settlin some old scores.  It is a brief but important point in helping to define the character of Luke beyond just being drunk and damaging public property.  As a service man we also discover that Luke won a bronze star achieved the rank of sergeant but came out as a private.  Again early evidence that Luke is unable to conform to any body's rules but his own. Yet we are given clear evidence that Luke knows what is right in principal and what is wrong.  At one point in the film when they are putting Luke in the box under less than reasonable circumstances he tells the boss calling it your job don't make it right Boss.  In a visit from his mother ArlettaJo Van Fleet Luke says plenty about his own character by telling her A man's got to go his own way or as he also puts it I tried to live always free and above board like you but I can't seem to find no elbow room. As Luke enters the prison that will supposedly be his home for the next two years we meet the other inmates.  Some of them wear chains some of them do not.  It is a point early in the film that director Stuart Rosenberg emphasizes.  We understand quickly that sooner or later you conform.    You either walk the line the way the bosses tell you to or they will find the means to get you to walk the line.  As the Captain reiterates for your own good you'll learn the rules A point driven home often.What we discover about their crimes is minuscule.  One is jailed for manslaughter after hitting a pedestrian with his car another is a paper hanger another new inmate is charged with breaking entering and assault. The nature of their crimes is unimportant to us.  It enables to view these prisoners as men and while we don't feel any genuine sympathy for them feeling disgusted by their crimes would have been a distraction from the true purpose of Pearce's story and Luke as the focal point.Because of his individuality it doesn't take Luke long before he unexpectedly becomes a hero to the other inmates.  It is not a role he chooses or even wants.  It unexpectedly imposes the burden on him of having to live up to the expectations of others.  He never truly understands the nature of this hero worship and would be just as happy if he didn't have to deal with it.  He is still trying to find his way in the world and if there is any real purpose for his existence.Another principal character is DraglineGeorge Kennedy.  It is he who finally establishes the fact that Cool Hand Luke is a man who can not be beaten.  Dragline's admiration for Luke seems to extend from the fact that heDraglinehas learned the rules on how to get by but yet regrets having lost some of his own individuality in the process.  He is the rest of the inmates in microcosm.  I can't remember a role that George Kennedy has ever been better in and he deservedly won the best supporting actor award.Cool Hand Luke is not without it's humorous moments especially in the  early going.  It is these moments that help move the film from the early stages to the darker more despairing later stages.  Perhaps for that reason alone we are even more effected by Luke's dilemma.In translating his novel to the screen Donn Pearce along with Frank Pierson has managed to bring the heart and soul of his nove to the big screen.  Lalo Shifrin's memorable score emphasizes often the repeated drudgery of working on the chain gang.

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw Cool Hand Luke the first week it came out. Went to see it with my father at a theater on the Upper East Side in Manhattan. We were just a few blocks away from the hospital where my Mom was dying of cancer and we just needed a break. It was cathartic. Feeling as beat up and left for dead as I was at the time I came across a character who knew how to take the punches. Luke is a beautifully crafted film. Not one wasted frame or moment. Donn Pearce and Frank Pierson's screenplay is nothing less than a working man's parable of a truly good soul who just couldn't seem to get a break. In ways it could be said he truly didn't let himself. But the strength within Luke that would not let him compromise who he was for who he was told to be the resilience to fight back against those who tried to fight him on that was inspirational. Whether it was a carefully chosen remark or just one of them Luke looks They knew They couldn't knock him out no matter how badly They knocked him down. Seems he handled life like that and it was an example I've clung to and have tried to follow in the almost fifty subsequent years. Conrad Hall's cinematography was breathtaking providing the scope of all the integral parts of the story with the immediacy of all the most intimate moments. Any single frame could hang on your living room wall as the centerpiece. The cast Dennis Hopper Strother Martin Lou Antonio Ralph Waite ... and George Kennedy. Academy Award Winner George Kennedy. Dragline. The most unforgettable gentle giant I believe I've ever seen on the silver screen. Each and every one of them in all their glory and in the simplest of nuances helped raise Paul Newman's masterful portrayal to an ever higher level maybe his best work ever. The character is very much the story in Cool Hand Luke and the ensemble brings it to life. Frustrating challenging confusing pain intheass life with just enough of that rebellious spirit to bring hope to those facing some of their tougher times. I saw the film four more times that first year and probably twice each year since whenever I could find it. Check in with Luke and the boys for a breath of fresh air and some worldshaking hope. Can't speak for anyone else but Luke is right up there with Atticus Finch for me when it comes to celluloid heroes these are the two whose stories got me through some really really bleak times. And for me Cool Hand Luke was ultimately a story of hope. The story of a man who never gave in. Never gave up. And never stopped grinning. All that they piled on him all they tried to bury him under ... just wasn't worth his getting worked up over. Wasn't gonna get to his spirit.".

When inside he stubbornly refuses to bow down to anybody be it the prison authorities or his fellow inmates. Soon though he becomes a symbol of hope to the other prisoners and his rebellious nature teaches them that their integrity is the most important thing they have.This antiauthoritarian film is very much in a similar mould to Bonnie and Clyde which also came out in 1967. In both of these films the establishment are shown to be the bad guys and the criminals antiheroes deserving of our sympathy. With this in mind it would only be fair to say that like Bonnie and Clyde Cool Hand Luke could be regarded as one of the very first New Hollywood movies. It certainly is a film which indicates that the cinematic norms were changing. It's also one of the first of a new type of prison drama which tried to reach for more authenticity. In many ways it is a precursor to the classic incarceratedmanagainstthesystem movie One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest 1975. For me it's not in the same league as that one but it's pretty obviously a very influential work. It benefits from a good ensemble cast with Paul Newman leading the picture very well with impressive support in particular from George Kennedy who would go on to win an Oscar for his efforts.".

There is no doubt however about George Kennedy as Dragline it is his finest achievement and fully deserves the Oscar he got for Best Supporting Actor. It is also fascinating to find so many familiar faces among the inmates  actors such as Dennis Hopper Harry Dean Stanton Joe Don Baker Ralph Waite. and Wayne Rogers  who would go on to fame in their own right. This movie can unquestionably be called a classic. American Movie Classics just started 112000 showing a beautifully restored letterbox version which shows it in all its glory.".

	schema:reviewBody "For the secret of man's being is not only to live but to have something to live for. Without a stable conception of the object of life man would not consent to go on living and would rather destroy himself than remain on earth though he had bread in abundance.  Fyodor Dostoyevsky. Stuart Rosenberg directs Cool Hand Luke. The plot? Paul Newman plays Luke Jackson a young drifter who returns home after WW2. Luke's been dealt one bad hand after the next and no matter how he plays his cards always seems to lose. The film opens with Luke drunk and shameless knocking the heads off parking meters. The authorities try to cash in on our everyday movements and this lack of freedom ticks Luke off. The poor guy just wants to be free man.After being arrested Luke is sent to a Florida prison. What then unfolds is one of the greatest existential movies of all time. Luke's experiences his conversations with God his isolation and alienation and a pair of profound scenes both involving his mother elevate Cool Hand Luke above most prisonbreak movies.Of course this period saw a number of strong prison flicks The Great Escape The Bridge on the River Kwai King Rat Birdman of Alcatraz Papillon Cuckoo's Nest The Hole Escape from Alcatraz A Man Escaped Riot in Cell Block 11 etc but Cool Hand Luke takes a far more mythical stance. We don't know much about Luke. He's held at a distance never looks anyone in the eyes when speaking and always has a sly grin on his face. And yet behind his smile we sense deep pain though its a pain matched by a dogged spirit to continue fighting. Interestingly whilst a film like One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest had a system that despite its flaws genuinely tried to heal and help others Luke's social institution is corrupt and in many aspects pointless. Still for a while Luke abides by it. He goes about the state's business with a smile cutting grass and paving roads. He only has 2 years in chains. He can make it. And like he says he has no place else to go. No plans. He plays his cards with cool detached ambivalence.In one beautiful scene Luke's dying mother comes to visit. What follows is a touching conversation she informing us that tried her best with Luke giving him nothing but love. And yet no amount of motherly affection has helped her family. Because of this she says she wishes mankind were like dogs. She wishes she could abandon her children and forget about them never having to worry or fret about how they are what they'll do or where they'll go. Of course she loves Luke but hates the agony he puts her through. And yet we sense that she understands him intimately. Perhaps she admires him because she too has been dealt a life of bad hands.Luke's outlook changes when his mother dies and the prison warden locks him in a box for no particular reason. When the Boss says Just doing my job Luke replies That don't make it right. From here on Luke begins to fight back. He refuses to spend his life on his knees and refuses to submit. The film then becomes a tale of resistance and idolatry. The other inmates quickly begin to idolise Luke worshipping his nevergiveup spirit. But rather than fight themselves they sit back and exalt Luke relying him to personify their own desires. Luke begins to resent this. Step feeding off me! he yells. But they're content to sit on the sidelines. He's a one man revolution and like many revolutionaries is praised for his stance from afar but never actively supported. Why do men have to die for causes before we take notice?The film ends on an ambiguous note in which Luke may or may not be riddled with bullets. Does Luke smile? Does he die? Does he survive? If he does survive is his survival merely wishful thinking on the part of his fellow inmates? Note that the film's final image is a brief shot of a photograph. It was established in an earlier sequence that this idyllic photograph represents a lie. We also know that the photograph's image was staged and that the photograph itself was torn to shreds earlier in the film. The ending thus suggests that though Luke has died and the system utterly beaten him down the men nevertheless choose to believe in him. They believe he has risen  indeed the film is filled with Christian imagery  that he's survived death and still fighting the fight sticking it to the man for all of mankind.But like that photograph the inmate's belief is an illusion. Luke is dead and though his fighting spirit remains in the hearts of these men it will take something larger to wake them up and shake them out of weak surrender. In the end Cool Hand Luke suggests something almost contradictory that hope must be held onto lest we submit but that such hope fuelled by a kind of mythologising and shared delusion is precisely what engenders submission. 910 An accidental masterpiece. The planets really lined up for this one. The only flaw is an overly silly though iconic car wash scene.Worth multiple viewings.".

Perfect hairstyles no fights except on Saturdays plenty of food and booze and basically everybody manages to keep their chins up play poker and have a good laugh most of the time. Other reviewers have cited the 'Hogan's Heroes' and 'Bilko' similarities.

No he wasn't he was possibly a complicated character but we learn nothing about what he really feels or why he did what he did. Whether that's Paul Newman's or the script's fault I can't tell but Paul Newman does his overblown 'Hustler' performance chewing more scenery than eggs in the process.

	schema:reviewBody "Greetings again from the darkness. I went way too many years without watching this movie again so when Cinemark included it in the summer classic film series I was in my seat nice and early. Mention this movie and the first thing people do is quote one of the most famous lines in movie history What we have here is failure to communicate. No question that's a great line. But there is so much more to this movie and it holds up beautifully 45 years later.Based on the novel by Donn Pearce who spent two years on a chaingang this is the story of Luke Paul Newman who just can't bring himself to conform to the rules regardless whether those be the rules of the military society prison or those selfimposed by the convicts. We are introduced to Luke as he drunkenly cuts off the top of parking meters on main street of a small town. Later in a throw away line we learn he was gaining revenge on someone. It's the clear indication that while he doesn't always want to fit in Luke clearly knows right from wrong.There are so many terrific scenes in this film that it's not possible to discuss each. Every scene with the prison warden played by Strother Martin is intense. Each of the Boss guards are frightening especially Morgan Woodward as the sharpshooter behind the mirrored shades. There are numerous impactful scenes featuring the group of convicts. Even though we learn little about the individuals we realize the fragile male psyche is on full display. Despite the power of all of these characters and scenes the real strength of the film is the relationship between Luke and Dragline George Kennedy. Watching the early cat and mouse game and the subsequent transfer of power feature two amazing actors at the top of their game.George Kennedy rightfully won the Best Supporting Actor award and continued on to become one of the most successful and prolific character actors of the 70's and 80's and his career culminated with his iconic role in the Naked Gun series. As for Paul Newman this is one of his best performance in a long line of standout performances. This one is in the middle stage of his career and he exuded manliness with a touch of sensitivity. He and Strother Martin would meet again in one of the best sequences of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.Watching Luke win over all the convicts including the previous leader played by Kennedy is stunning yet gutwrenching when offset by the scenes with the guards who are hell bent on getting Luke to understand his place. They understand the risk he poses to the systematic rhythms of the prison.The supporting cast is downright incredible. This was the feature film debut for Ralph Waite 4 years later he became the beloved paternal figure of TV's The Waltons Joe Don BakerBuford Pusser from Walking Tall James Gammon later the crusty manager in Major League and Anthony Zerbe another iconic character actor of the 70's and 80's. Also featured are Dennis Hopper Harry Dean Stanton singing a few songs Wayne Rogers from MASH Richard Davalos James Dean's brother Aron in East of Eden and Rance Howard Ron's dad as the sheriff. In a brief but truly great scene Jo Van Fleet also from East of Eden appears as Arletta and we quickly understand Luke's background.Often overlooked by film historians Lucille putting on a show for the convicts as she washes her car is a scene that is meant for more than titillation. As she creatively buffs the windows the reaction of the convicts reminds us that these are still men and no amount of humiliation and degradation can change that. One of my friends argues that Joy Harmon was clearly cheated out of an Oscar for this scene.The score is the handy work of Lalo Schifrin and expertly captures the moment ... especially in the black top scene. Director Stuart Rosenberg was known only for his TV work when he got this script. He went on to direct another prison movie in 1980 called Brubaker. Starring Newman's Butch Cassidy costar Robert Redford the film was a decent prison drama but not at the level of Cool Hand Luke ... which by the way was installed into the National Film Registry in 2005.".

	schema:reviewBody "Now that it has become sort of fashionable to speak or write badly about the films of the 60s and 70s saying that people stopped going to the movie theatres during that fruitful period which is not true we must more than everrate a flick as Cool Hand Luke as it really deserves. The rebel spirit of the lead character played to perfection by the excellent Paul Newman against that brutal and most of the times unfair establishment represented by the prison guards is a subject that remains as topical as ever. If this picture had been made today it could also probably be good but it would undoubtedly be much more unpleasant and filled with fourletter words. Besides who could match the performances of Newman George Kennedy the deservedly Oscarwinner who has kept on making a brilliant career do you remember him as The Blue Knight? Strother Martin J.D.Cannon etc.? Jo Van Fleets character as Lukes mother seems a sort of slightlyaged version of her role as James Deans mum in East Of Eden and it is really worthwhile. The scene of the hardboiled eggs is a classic and a gem but my favourite scene in the movie is that of the carwashing girl so wonderfully played by Joy Harmon who is really a Joy for any mans eyes that character truly says a lot of things without speaking her gorgeous body speaks for her! I must say that its not only one of the sexiest scenes Ive ever seen in a film but also a very significative one there is an enormous contrast between the image of the lass moving and shaking in complete and absolute freedom even in her way of dressing and the imprisoned menatwork who watch her as something extremely desirable but alas completely out of reach. The viewer can really feel like a prisoner too!. All in all this is a fine film of the 60s but also of the 70s the 80s the 90s the 21st century and whatever God wants it to come.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cool Hand Luke is perhaps Paul Newman's most memorable character. He was outstanding as Hud but he seems to have topped that performance in this 1967 classic.Newman plays a man named Luke. After cutting the heads off some parking meters he is thrown into a prison system where he's forced to do some hard time tending to country roads. This character has to be one of the biggest enigmas in film history. Luke is likable enough. His mother points out to him that he's even had some good jobs. The viewer is left to ponder why in the heck he can't stay out of trouble.Not much is told about his past. We know he fought WWII and even won some medals. He has no wife or children to care for. He has a mother who appears to be dying of lung cancer or some such ailment. His other family members seem to hold a grudge against him. We never really learn why he feels the need to cut the heads off the parking meters but he's caught redhanded. The prison he's sent to makes its inmates work their tails off but it looks like they'll treat you fairly if you follow their rules. Luke has no intentions of following any rules laid down by the warden or the bosses that watch over the road work though.After taking a tremendous beating from the toughest inmate Kennedy Luke quickly begins to win the admiration of his fellow prisoners. His spirit catches on with the others and they begin to get their work done more quickly and effectively than ever before. Things begin to go downhill for Luke once he learns of his mother's passing. He repeatedly tries to escape and soon the warden and his cronies are out to break his spirit and make him conform. The film becomes a test of wills and a fascinating character study.The biggest question the viewer is left with is why?. Luke could have simply served out his time and then gone on to a more normal existence. That seems to be out of the realm of possibilities for the character however. He isn't simply out to impress the other prisoners. At one point he even demands they stop trying to feed off of him for all their strength. Luke seems like a man who simply cannot allow others to tell him how to live. There are a few moments where he openly questions the existence of God but that angle doesn't go very far. It merely makes the guards want to abuse him even more but that's about it. It becomes almost frustrating to see this man keep digging a bigger and bigger hole for himself. At one point Luke is forced to literally do just that.What exactly is the film trying to tell us? It doesn't seem to be advocating disobedience. We cheer for Luke when he's causing trouble for the guards but we feel his pain when they punish him. The film's conclusion is more somber than inspiring.Rosenberg's direction is outstanding and the supporting cast shines. George Kennedy earned an Oscar for his performance. Overall this is an excellent film not to be missed! 10 of 10 stars from The Hound.".

Picture James Dean doing this part had he lived to do films like these.Newman plays his usual nonconformist rebel type but he's really a rebel without a cause. He's in his early forties a Korean war veteran who just hasn't found his place in civilian life. He gets himself busted for no great cause just on a drunken spree in some Southern town he decides to knock the heads off a bunch of parking meters.That lands him a stint in a county jail with a lot of outdoor work on a road gang. He fights with but later wins the respect and becomes friends with George Kennedy the head honcho in his barracks.The real tragedy of Cool Hand Luke is that Newman is a failure in life it's why he's in prison. He gains the respect of his fellow convicts for those ways but that involves going against the penal system and in the end that gets you nothing. Can you picture James Dean as a forty something doing what Newman is doing? It would have been his kind of role for sure.Newman does a fine job playing the nonconformist Luke who seems to be just going on the path fate has decreed for him. George Kennedy got his Oscar winning career role as Dragline. Other men in Luke's barracks are Wayne Rogers Robert Drivas and J.D. Cannon and they fill their roles well.Strother Martin as the warden of the place is the guy with the film's favorite line what we've got is failure to communicate. Martin and his correction officers have many interesting ways of getting their point across.Cool Hand Luke may very well be the saddest role Newman ever undertook in his long career.".

For anyone with any shred of common sense serving the short sentence would be enough. Get in get out lesson learned.But to make the story interesting Luke manages to create friction where there was none for no good reason other than tendency to selfdestruct. He is not an anticonformist not very smart and not really having much of a goal. He is healthy and perfectly capable of earning a living. But he decides to go down in flames albeit with questionable style. I found it torturing to watch dumb character doing dumb things. In few instances we see Luke trying to talk to God but the conversation is lacking uninspiring and pointless. Those moments make Luke sound like a spoiled selfabsorbed angry teen.Perhaps the book's author and filmmakers would like to believe that Cool Hand Luke is a story about someone who was wronged or searching for God or inspiring others to be different but it is none of those. This film falls flat on its face in all departments and earns only high marks for its shallowness and decent performances. For a truly great story about anticonformism one should watch One Flew Over The Cuckoo's nest. Cool Hand Luke is nowhere near that.All in all this depressing pointless story is the best way to ruin your evening.

	schema:reviewBody "This film is set in America's Deep South in the years after the Second World War. Luke Jackson a downonhisluck war veteran is arrested for vandalising parking meters while drunk and sentenced to imprisonment in a brutally tough prison. At first his offhand seemingly arrogant attitude alienates not only the prison governor and guards but also his fellowprisoners and he is soon challenged to a fight by another inmate named Dragline. The tall powerfully built Dragline is an easy victor but Luke's determination and fighting spirit never knowing when he is beaten and refusing to quit arouse the respect of the others especially Dragline who becomes his close friend. Luke becomes a hero to the prisoners because they see him as a rebel who refuses to be beaten by the system. His nickname stems from the cool way in which he plays a hand at poker but it also refers to his remaining cool in the face of persecution. Luke makes two escape attempts but on both occasions he is recaptured and brought back to the prison for punishment by the guards who are determined to break his spirit. It seems that they have succeeded but then Luke and Dragnet make one last break for freedom.On one level this film is a critique of the inhumanity of the American prison system part of a tradition going back to I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang and continuing more recently with Brubaker also directed by Stuart Rosenberg and the less successful The Last Castle. The regime in this jail is particularly inhuman. The prisoners are put to work all day digging ditches in the hot sun. It is never made clear whether the ditches need to be dug and the prisoners are a useful source of free labour or whether putting them to demeaning and useless work is seen as a means of keeping them under control and of giving vent to the sadistic impulses of their jailers. There is a long list of petty regulations breach of which is punished by a night in the box a tiny cell used for solitary confinement. The guards take a perverse delight in tormenting and humiliating the prisoners. Strother Martin's governor who prefers to be called the Captain is a particularly frightening figure a little man with a grating highpitched voice who can even make a piece of bland managementspeak like What we have here is a failure to communicate sound like a terrifying threat.The film is more however than a socialrealist exposure of conditions in America's jails. It was made in the sixties the decade when the times they were achanging and when traditional concepts of authority were being challenged everywhere. Like a number of films from the sixties and seventies Cool Hand Luke reflects this popular mood. The film with which it has most in common is One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest in which Jack Nicholson does for mental asylums what Paul Newman does here for prisons. Newman's screen persona was often that of the cool detached outsider. This may have had the effect of narrowing his range as an actor somewhat he could often seem too laid back in more traditional types of film such as Hitchcock's Torn Curtain but it meant that he could be excellent playing antiheroes in films of this nature. Hombre is another example. Here in one of his best performances he makes Luke a symbol of the little man standing up against authority. We learn that he was a hero in the war and was decorated a number of times but that he finished the war as a private after being demoted from sergeant. The implication is that military discipline was as uncongenial to him as prison discipline and that he lost his rank for some act of insubordination. Even his crime can be seen as a protest against the petty tyranny of rules and regulations of which parking meters are a symbol.There has been speculation about the possible religious implications of the film and whether Luke is intended to be a Christfigure. Certainly the shot in which he is seen in a crucifixlike pose after the eggeating contest is derived from standard Christian imagery but in my view this is not a deliberate Christian allegory along the lines of Whistle Down the Wind or The Omega Man. In orthodox Christian thought Christ is much more than a rebel against authority or even a man unjustly persecuted he is also the Son of God and the Redeemer of mankind. One scene does not an allegory make. Nevertheless there are undoubted religious overtones to the film. If Luke is an allegorical figure the allegory is not with Christ but with Everyman a man in search sometimes a despairing search of God. He claims not to believe in God yet has long conversations with Him. The song he sings after the death of his mother is irreverent possibly blasphemous but blasphemy is the sin of the angry believer not of the unbeliever. A true atheist cannot blaspheme because there is nothing for him to blaspheme against.Newman was nominated for Best Actor and George Kennedy won a welldeserved Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Dragline but I was surprised that the film was not nominated as Best Picture especially as the nominations in 1968 included a film as weak as Dr Doolittle. Whatever the Academy may have thought however Cool Hand Luke is a film that has matured well. It is a multilayered film that works well on each of its several levels of meaning. With I am a Fugitive. and The Birdman of Alcatraz it is one of the greatest of all prison dramas. This was Stuart Rosenberg's first feature film but like Orson Welles Citizen Kane Sidney Lumet Twelve Angry Men and Bryan Forbes Whistle Down the Wind he made a great film on his first attempt. 910".

So he has a few beers gets his mitts on a big pipe cutter and thought I'm gonna show these jerks.Cool Hand Luke has a big reputation but for me it doesn't quite live up to it. The highlight is the iconic car wash sequence with Joy Harmon as well as the ending when Luke talks with God about why He made him such a misfit. The rest is a decent prison drama about an eccentric individualist who inspires those around him stuck in the same pen. It's a character study of a likable impressive but unruly person who doesn't seem to grasp that getting sloshed and destroying public property has negative repercussions. Gee maybe you shouldn't try to solve your problems by getting drunk and vandalizing. The movie is realistic and wellmade but generally tedious although I'm sure that's the point  being confined on a prison farm WOULD be tedious. The Christ typology is interesting however and I can understand how some grade it higher. The movie runs 126 minutes and was shot Tavares  Jacksonville Florida and San JoaquinSacramento River Delta California with studio work done in Burbank. GRADE C 5.510".

	schema:reviewBody "I read another comment on here that said that this and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest are two films which are pretty much identical. While I was watching Cool Hand Luke I did recollect the other classic to me still much more extraordinary guyslockedup movie Cuckoo's Nest as it did have its hero knocking an authority as tough as a ton on bricks. But there's a big difference between the two films in Cuckoo's Nest you had in Nicholson a rebelrouser who didn't mind getting some real words across to people with his plight and the people he was locked up with are actually to a basic degree sane. Newman is much as the title suggests 'cool' as he really doesn't have that much dialog for most of the picture and the system he's bucking isn't supposed to be helping him and the people he's with. They're there on the chain gang to bust ass and do the work that nobody in their right mind would do unless pointed by a gun to do so. Though on the other hand this dynamic from Newman amid a very good prison movie still makes Cool Hand Luke quite memorable for its ways of bucking the system.It's also by turns an often funny movie with the centerpiece of the 50 egg bet being one that is just sheerly unabashedly entertaining. And it's the kind of scene that does almost remind someone of that scene in Cuckoo's Nest where they all get riled up during the 'baseball game' on TV. But sometimes the filmmakers doing Cool Hand Luke do perhaps push a wee bit much allegory on such a simple set of events less a story than necessary. At the end of the 50 egg sequence Newman is basically laid out on the table and I'm sure it's meant to be intentional in the form of Christ. This is played up for a lot of the rest of the film as it's perhaps really intuited that he's suffering for the other prisoner's sins and may even perhaps someday die for it all. This side ends up becoming a little preachy even if its meant to be subtle which I don't think it is and it detracts from the greater pleasures of watching a picture like this.Because really aside from the allegory this is just good old prison picture and one that pushes the boundaries of the prisonerescape angle such as that Newman's Luke escapes for the whole second half of the movie! It's also kind of bittersweet that the filmmakers decide not to show how Newman gets captured but leaves it at first on the prisoners who after getting beaten up by Oscar winning George Kennedy's rily character and getting them to fix a road like its some competition and then just suddenly he's caught again. At one point this even leads to the now classic line once sampled in a Guns n Roses song what we've got here is failure to communicate by the always great character actor Strother Martin. Though if you're not really looking for message or allegory it's also just a really neat 'guy' movie in the best sense of the word with scenes like the torturous girlwashescarinfrontofchaingang scene and of course ones that just show them acting like real guys. It's populated by a plethora of acting talent with Kennedy Dennis Hopper Luke Askew and even a guitar strummingsinging Harry Dean Stanton! Which is a hoot if you've seen as mant Stanton films as me.And then finally there's Newman himself definitely in one of his seminal roles even if it's not a fullon total masterwork. Here he actually does create a character out of someone who is really sort of a nobody with no real aims. He doesn't even know what do to when he breaks out of prison even as he gets as far as Chicago. I never planned anything in my life he says at one point. That the character only has maybe 15 lines in the film isn't a problem for Newman either. He makes such a thin character ultimately likable and strong and fulfills such an antihero very believably especially when he's most needed to put up his acting chops towards the end of the picture. Even if you're not too much into prison movies and this one does have in it the kind of spirit that speaks back to the films of the 30s in a good way for the oldschool fans it's worth it just to see what Newman does alongside the other actors. It also holds up pretty well decades later which is a credit not just to Newman but to the screenwriters and director Stuart Rosenberg probably the highlight of an otherwise journeyman filmmaker career.".

	schema:reviewBody "Forty years ago. When I first saw this I was completely captured by it. I was a simple soul who believed in simple situations. It was a bad time a time of evil politicians and a bad war. This resonated as a strong soul casually defiant. It mattered in an affirmative way to the emerging counterculture what we thought was such anyway.Twenty years ago I saw it again and was struck by the genre nature of it. The 30's was the previous era where the powerful establishment was distrusted and people suffered as a result. In that time prison movies formed a strong genre that has all but disappeared now. But the then it was a subgenre to have an innocent good man often a war hero sent to prison to suffer at the hands of the man. By simple dint of Biblicalquality goodness he wins in some way. The viewers silently celebrate and then left the theater to fight their own fights with the system.It struck me how similar this was to that template and how similar the reasons. The only difference was that in the 30s the audience would be swept toward socialist ideals and in the sixties the war was against some disembodied notion of domino communism.

	onyx:emotionText "Forty years ago. When I first saw this I was completely captured by it. I was a simple soul who believed in simple situations. It was a bad time a time of evil politicians and a bad war. This resonated as a strong soul casually defiant. It mattered in an affirmative way to the emerging counterculture what we thought was such anyway.Twenty years ago I saw it again and was struck by the genre nature of it. The 30's was the previous era where the powerful establishment was distrusted and people suffered as a result. In that time prison movies formed a strong genre that has all but disappeared now. But the then it was a subgenre to have an innocent good man often a war hero sent to prison to suffer at the hands of the man. By simple dint of Biblicalquality goodness he wins in some way. The viewers silently celebrate and then left the theater to fight their own fights with the system.It struck me how similar this was to that template and how similar the reasons. The only difference was that in the 30s the audience would be swept toward socialist ideals and in the sixties the war was against some disembodied notion of domino communism. And the genre had to be hidden by setting it in the south then as now evoking a backward people.But I just saw it again. Since the last time I have heard Paul Newman speak of it.

	schema:headline " The Collie Franchise Started Here";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm sure that when MGM was filming Lassie Come Home they were not aware they would be setting up the foundation of a collie franchise. The film obviously was meant to be a B picture filler as none of MGM's big box office names were used. But the story of the loyal collie dog who traveled over 1000 miles from Scotland to Yorkshire to return to his young master struck a nostalgic chord in the English speaking world.What MGM did do for this film was use location footage most likely in California and film it in Technicolor. Doing that made the film a classic and wanted by today's market which disdains black and white.Two young future stars Roddy McDowall and Elizabeth Taylor are in this as children and they are an appealing pair. For the rest of the cast MGM made liberal use of the English colony in Hollywood with Elsa Lanchester Donald Crisp Nigel Bruce Edmund Gwenn Alan Napier Arthur Shields and Dame May Witty and her husband Ben Webster. In fact if you take away the two child stars this film may just have the oldest average age of any film cast around.Elizabeth Taylor and Roddy McDowall formed a lifetime friendship from this film. She also became very attached to Donald Crisp who became a father figure for her until his death in 1974. Crisp and McDowall are reunited as father and son as they were in How Green Was My Valley.The plot is a simple one. Because he's out of work and needs the money for food on the table Donald Crisp sells the pure bred collie to Lord Nigel Bruce who takes him from Yorkshire to Scotland. But Lassie ain't having this and escapes and makes the journey to what she considers home. The story is about her adventures on the way.After over 60 years Lassie is still appealing to children of all ages everywhere.".

	onyx:emotionText "I'm sure that when MGM was filming Lassie Come Home they were not aware they would be setting up the foundation of a collie franchise. The film obviously was meant to be a B picture filler as none of MGM's big box office names were used. But the story of the loyal collie dog who traveled over 1000 miles from Scotland to Yorkshire to return to his young master struck a nostalgic chord in the English speaking world.What MGM did do for this film was use location footage most likely in California and film it in Technicolor.

Two of the great character actors Donald Crisp and Edmund Gwenn as Sam Carraclough and Rowlie Palmer respectively add so much to the feel of this film. Carraclough family needs money so sell the only thing of worth a dog named Lassie to Nigel Bruce the Duke. Roddy McDowall plays Joe Carraclough who loves the dog with all his heart and viceversa from Lassie. The dog is taken to Scotland and Lassie must escape in order to  come home to Joe. There is a great river to swim to reach England but Lassie does it. The cost is great she is near death until an old couple care for her and nurse her back to health. But something is wrong at 350pm each day she must leave somewhere? The couple gave her freedom for the journey home. Lassie then joins Rowlie Palmer a potspans traveling salesman along with his own beloved dog Toots. Little Toots is better than a wife for Rowlie because she is neat clean and gives no back check to Rowlie. Poor Toots is killed trying to save her master. Finally Lassie makes it home. Damaged injured and a wanted dog she braves whatever it takes to get home. But wait she belongs to the Duke not Joe can the humans in the story arrange a proper home for Lassie?

	schema:reviewBody "I sat down tonight to watch this movie thinking it would be good warmhearted fare at the end of a hard day at work. I couldn't watch it. Just. Could. NOT.I spent the first 15 minutes of the movie crying. I started out tearyeyed for the few brief minutes where Lassie and her boy played by a roughly 12yrold Roddy MacDowell were together knowing from the basic plot of the movie father sells dog to man who lives hundreds of miles away that the boy and the dog would soon be separated. From there I moved on to fullblown tears when Roddy comes home from school and asks his parents where Lassie is. Anyone who's ever had a dog or ever loved a dog will not be able to take this scene.We then see where Lassie is living now ... in a kennel on a rich man's estate who has tons of dogs. Lassie is laying in her kennel all listless because she misses her family. More tears! A mean caretaker of the animals tells Lassie I'll make you eat even if I have to shove your food down your throat. That did it for me! That was 15 minutes into the movie I was crying my eyes out and I said to myself there's no way I can sit through another 75 minutes of this torment of seeing Lassie and her boy separated of seeing all the terrible ordeals that Lassie must go through before she is reunited with her boy.I fastforwarded to the end thinking the ending would make me happy and would make up for the 15 minutes of sobbing. Well ... it did and it didn't. I saw the last 2 or so minutes of the film beginning with a much skinnier Lassie limping on 3 legs to meet Roddy at his school. How did she get so skinny? What happened to her front paw that made her not be able to walk on it? I don't want to know! The scene is so touching so heartbreaking I don't think anyone could watch it without bursting out sobbing like a baby. Young Roddy did a terrific acting job when he showed his glee and love at seeing his precious Lassie again.I've read the other comments here and understand that Lassie went through many trials while traveling back home from Scotland to Yorkshire. I'm glad I fastforwarded the movie I don't think I could've taken those scenes! If you ever need a good cry just watch this movie. I can't recall any other movie I've ever seen that has stirred such emotionality in me and certainly none that has ever made me cry so hard both from sadness and happiness and a dozen other emotions.This review is based on seeing 17 of the 90 minutes of this film. I think if I saw all 90 minutes I'd be drowning in a pool made from my own tears right now. I don't have enough Kleenex in the house to watch this whole danged movie!".

Also excellent was the acting Roddy McDowall and Elizabeth Taylor are appealing as the children Nigel Bruce gives a gruff aggressive yet sympathetic performance with some Dr Watsonlike facial expressions and Edmund Gwenn who I know best from the original Miracle on 34th Street is outstanding as Rowlie. What made the film though was Lassie an astonishing canine performance from Pal who acts so convincingly and moves as swiftly as the wind. Also Lassie's pining were so achingly sad you couldn't help feel for the poor dog especially in the very poignant ending. And yes I cried when Toots died.

	schema:headline " Innocence with a message";
	schema:reviewBody "I watched this movie specifically because I want to relax and enjoy a film that was innocent and dreamy. It turns out that Lassie was this and much more. It is a great film about how a dog lights up a lonely child's life. Lassie is there every day when school ends to meet his owner Roddy McDowell. There is a lot more to this film. The boy's parents are good people but they are poor and have the survival instinct of their class. They like Lassie but also see dogs as a burden and an expense that are welcome only when there is work. Unfortunately the boy's father is unemployed right now and his Mom explains that it is either us or the dog that they can support. Lassie is sold to a wealthy landowner played by Nigel Bruce. Bruce plays a decent fellow but one driven by a desire to breed animals that make him money and prestige at shows. He hires a mean man to tend his dogs someone who is clearly from the lower classes and is in the wrong profession. He dislikes animals and only wants to control them and make them perform in shows. Lassie is eventually taken to Scotland several hundred miles away from home in the Yorkshire. You guessed it. Lassie spends the rest of the movie making the perilous journey trying to get back home to the boy. This was the finest part of the film. The main flaw is the scenery was obviously California not Scotland and England. Edmund Gwynn plays one of the most lovable characters  an old man who travels from town to town perform tricks with his dog companion. He represents the best in us all  kindness honor and appreciation. Other memorable characters are the elderly couple who rescue him from a rainstorm. The elderly lady is lonely. However in one of the most heartwarming scenes of compassion she realizes that Lassie wants to get home to someone. She is willing to let go of the dog who relieves her loneliness so Lassie can be truly happy. What I liked most about this movie is that it was set in a bygone era of innocence. Dogs really make lives better for people. I also liked that it touched base on the people who are touched by dog's lives  what their dilemmas in life were.".

In this first film Lassie's family resorts to desperate measures during their desperate times. They're broke and decide to sell the family dog to the Duke but Lassie won't have it! She loves her little boy Roddy MacDowell too much and follows the family after they move.If you're animal lover keep your Kleenexes handy but feel free to relax. Unlike Old Yeller this is a true family film and can be enjoyed by even the little kiddies. Donald Crisp and Elsa Lanchester play Roddy's parents doesn't it seem like Donald Crisp is a perpetual father figure? He's just very trustworthy even when he's doing something terrible like selling his son's dog. And keep your eye out for a young elevenyearold Elizabeth Taylor! She's very beautiful and for an actor to steal attention away from an on screen animal that's an incredible achievement. Hollywood always warns against making movies with animals since no one will pay attention to the human costars. Miss Taylor proved that old adage wrong and it's easy to see why.".

Within seconds he almost gets run over by a little penguin whizzing by followed by a huge Eskimo. Later the little penguin comes by while Bugs is ready to go back in his hole and try again for Miami Beach. He dresses the penguin up with a top and tie to go with the rest of his looks. When Bugs dives back the penguin follows. This happens several times. Apparently he has made a new friend but Bugs wants none of that. He boots the penguin down an icy sloop but watches as the Eskimo captures him in his burlap bag.Oh well says Bugs who walks back to his hole. It's none of my business. I'm not my penguin's keeper. However in a flash he pops back up his conscience obviously getting the better of him and goes back to rescue the little guy. Bugs stops for a second turns to the camera and speaks to us the audience admonishing us for thinking Bugs wouldn't do the right thing!Bugs then dons a disguise gets the Eskimo's attention....and the chase is on. From that point on there's some pretty funny stuff visually and dialogwise with Bug's wisecracks".

The scene where the penguin rescues Bugs from a fall is something only Chuck Jones could think of. There are laughs to be had for sure but this is one of those shorts that's heavy on the cute factor. The animation is great with welldrawn characters and backgrounds and nice colors. Carl Staling's music is lively and fun. Mel Blanc's voice work is flawless. It's a good cartoon but not something everybody will enjoy. If you don't like cartoons with cute characters like Tweety and Pussyfoot you probably won't like this.".

Yes the cartoon is funny in certain places but I am quite sentimental about that poor little penguin particularly when he reveals his sad face to Bugs. Of course it's also very pleasing to see the penguin smile and jump and clap his wings together.Here are my favorite scenes from Frigid Hare. When Bugs first arrives in Antarctica believing it's Miami Beach and takes a dive into the water watch his reaction! Bugs is also quite funny in his sexy female Eskimo disguise to the familiar musical accompaniment of You Must Have Been a Beautiful Baby as he whacks a lusty Eskimo in the face with a fish.A helpless little penguin may not seem like much for Bugs Bunny to play off of but Bugs establishes a friendship with the little tyke while still managing to give us a few laughs along the way.".

Perhaps a little too cutesy to ever have become a star alongside the more anarchic characters the penguin nevertheless proves a great foil for Bugs Bunny. When Bugs takes yet another wrong turning on the way to Miami beach and ends up at the South Pole he quickly becomes implicated in the chase between a sweet little penguin and a big dumb Eskimo. While its possible that the Eskimo stereotype may offend some everything else about this cartoon is so warm despite its setting that only the most hardhearted of critics would deny its appeal. The interplay between Bugs and the penguin is beautifully executed and there's a fantastic chase sequence between Bugs and the Eskimo brought about by what is perhaps Bugs' most convincing drag routine of all time! It all leads to a clever and unpredictable punch line that'll make you laugh and go awww in equal measures.".

The animation is simply beautiful with all the characters drawn well and the Antarctic landscapes beautifully realised. The music as always is lovely it still has energy but it is a little more poignant this time. The dialogue is witty and the story is well paced and is never dull. The characters are great too the Eskimo is good enough and it was a wise decision not to use him too much while making him important to the plotline. However Bugs is much better with all the hilarious dialogue and rascally yet likable persona and he is brilliantly voiced by Mel Blanc. Even better than Bugs is the little penguin he is simply adorable as he clapped with joy and cried icicles you couldn't help but feel for him. Overall an adorable and lovely little cartoon. 1010 Bethany Cox".

There are some classic quotes that will enter the English language regularly I'm sure. They referenced some movies such as Star Wars Raiders of the Lost Ark etc. I have to admit my favorite was the scene from Ferris Bueller's day off. The movie continued to include most of the characters from the series even the minute ones that only show themselves here and there. The story was complete and interesting and honestly kept you laughing the whole time. There was enough story to keep you interested and it was not choppy. It really ran smoothly and didn't make you wonder why something was happening. It truly ran like a longer episode. This is a must not miss for anyone who watches the series and thinks that it is amusing!".

The main point of the storyline is Stewie as the three episodes sort of have the same theme to them and it looks like it was sort of a three parter with two and three being more of the loop than the first one. Stewie has a near death experience not only that he has seen a man that looks just like him on the television and he is convinced that it is his real father rather than Peter and this sends him and Brian on a trip to San Francisco. Once there a startling well not startling by this show's standards is made. Very funny overall if you like the show you should enjoy this.

The funniest episodes ever of family guy have been based on interactions between Brian and Stewie which MacFarlane delivers. The movie is comparable to a few episodes of the show strung together but will be enjoyed whether you're a fan or not. To top it off the cameos of well known characters adds an ambiance that Family Guy aficionados will love much like the first episode of the 2005 season. Although I'm a long time fan of the show I am usually very pessimistic. However the only criticism I can conjure up is that I wanted more when the movie ended.".

If it were an episode it would probably be one of my alltime favorites.In this featurelength episode Stewie tries to kill a little boy by blowing him up with a bomb. But after being hurt himself he goes to Hell and realizes what a terrible place it really is. He is determined to be a good bye so he'll never have to go back there. When he sees a man on the television who looks remarkably like him he thinks it has to be his biological father. He travels to San Francisco to meet the man facetoface. It turns out that the man isn't his father it's him from the future. Thirtyfive years in the future people take vacations to periods of time not to destinations. When older Stewie goes to go back young Stewie hops on and goes for a ride. Stewie is disappointed to see no monuments or statues dedicated to him. He thought he would've taken over the world by now. Older Stewie reveals that he abandoned his plans for world domination years ago. And that he is a normal guy. When it's revealed that he's a thirtyfive year old virgin Stewie is determined to get him laid. We see the Griffin family in their older ages. Chris is a police officer who is married to a horrible woman. He's so funny. He lists all of the laws that Lois has broken and says he won't write her up as long as she gives him a cookie. And he yells the word cookie. It's so funny. Peter and Lois are pretty much the same just older. And Meg is now a man. Ron is his new name.Overall I give this movie that's technically a long episode 10 out of 10.".

This is a valid criticism because of the length of the film.With the episodes the asides like the time I come thick and fast and easily cover the plot to the point where nobody watches for the stories just the laughs. However with the film the hits are spread a bit thinner and as a result it does occasionally feel a bit baggy giggly and I remember sometimes waiting for the next laugh. So I agree with those fans that thought this was not as good as the series not because I'm a precious fanboy with unrealistic expectations and a rosetinted memory but because it didn't entertain me as much as I would have liked.That said I'm glad I watched it and it did enough for me as I imagine it will do for those who enjoy the series.

This movie is about a untold story of Stewie himself in the future where he sees Stewie as a grown up. So the Griffen's went to a pool. Peter Griffen knew that there was a new store in Quahog. So Peter Griffen thinks of a very good TV show with the channel 5 Action News station. His show will be Do You Know What Grinds Your Gears. So then Tom Tucker got fired. Stewie stops drinking and then gets drunk. So then Brian takes Stewie to the Drunken Clam to get him more drunk. Just then the car was crashed into the Drunken Clam when they got drunk. So the Channel 5 News was on to tell the story what has happen. Then another show of What Really Grinds My Gears the last part and then gets fired then says F word and sensors it. This movie is funny you will like Peter Griffen's funny show even more.".

Now there was enough material here for four episodes but they trimmed it down to three in the actual show. I admit that I'm not a fan of Family Guy but this was still enjoyable. Besides it wasn't really until later that Family Guy became particularly hated. I counted 45 cutaway gags in this movie! What's interesting here is that there are a lot of things that really do build up.The thing was I didn't get a feeling that this was epic enough for a movie. It still didn't seem large scale. Of course it probably was better than most episodes of the actual show. There are lots of funny little lines here and there. I especially love the opening sequence where they talk about how they're rolling out the red carpet for a direct to video movie. With all the awful direct to video movies I've seen this month this was quite refreshing. It has some good satire in it and it doesn't really seem like Family Guy will ever get a theatrically released movie unlike My Little Pony hee hee. ".

Leaving behind the sour taste of Wicker Park Scottish McGuigan follows the likes of his own Gangster Number 1 with this incredibly cool at times funny thriller that has somehow sneaked into the cinemas without much of a fuss. Supporting cast includes a very welcome cameo from a Jackie Brown star and a bunch of UK actors imitating their US counterpart's accents to perfection. The pairing of Sir Ben and Freeman alone is worth the price of admission but this is Hartnettas Slevin's film and perhaps it should not be too surprising that he carries it off effectively. In fact none of the cast really put a foot wrong and even Lucy Liu is pretty adorable against type if you believe the all the press.Despite a reasonably confusing series of opening events Slevin is essentially a straight forward neat black comedy of errorsmistaken identity for one. The dialogue is at times razor sharp and the action is well shot. The body count climbs steadily as the movie progresses at a cracking pace that never becomes dull. Slevin is thematically similar to a few other choice stories but like Kiss Kiss Bang Bang  Slevin should be enjoyed more for the ride and the audience should try not to guess ahead of the plot and let it unfold naturally. There will still be some surprises appearing even for the most avid film fans but like so many thrillers Slevin could be ruined from word of mouth. If it weren't for the warm familiar feel of similar films this little gem would be rated higher. Unfairly dismissed by some as confusing wrongly compared to the legendary Usual Suspects  it's a league apart from the mess that was Revolver and doesn't outstay a welcome.Oh and Willis gets to call someone a 'f head'.

But you know it fits somehow and Scottish director Paul McGuigan Wicker Park manages to keep you guessing while firmly grabbing your attention and holding it with hardly a second to take a breath.In the film noir tradition but with the intense and graphic violence of the Lock Stock and Layer Cake genre Slevin is really a caper movie and frankly reminded me more of The Sting than anything else. It dances nimbly from grisly stomachchurning action to clever and lighthearted banter. This could only be accomplished by a truly incredible cast led by Josh Hartnett in an outstanding performance great work by Lucy Liu Bruce Willis doing his thing and supported by the always excellent Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley. There's even a little time for Stanley Tucci.Liu plays Lindsay the nextdoorneighbornatural sleuthcoronerlove interest who discovers Slevin in her neighbor Nick's apartment. They mystery that immediately engages her is what happened to Nick who never shows up. However plenty of people do show up mistaking Slevin for Nick and before long he is neck deep in murder contracts called debts and warring gang factions. Hartnett plays the role to perfection. I've never seen him this good. He is both convincing and empathetic as a glib fearless victim of mistaken identity yet filled with confidence that he can make his plan work.This is a terrific film assuming you can stomach the bloody violence. The pieces fit neatly together well I have one bone to pick with the scriptwriter but it would be revealing too much to share it. I highly recommend Lucky Number Slevin.".

Josh Hartnett is good as Slevin who may know more about his situation than he's letting on or maybe not. Hartnett proves to be effective in the role. Morgan Freeman is great as The Boss but he isn't given much to do. The same can go for Ben Kinsgley as The Rabbi but he like Freeman still make the best of their villain roles. The rest of the cast including Lucy Liu Stanley Tucci and Bruce Willis as a hitman are solid as the supporting characters in their limited screen time. The few action sequences are well executed and the intricate but not too complicated plot keeps your interest. Despite some flaws with character development this movie was better than expected.

	schema:headline " A Very Twisted Revenge Thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "Lucky Number Slevin is a stylish revenge thriller with an incredible number of twists a high body count and a collection of characters who are almost all totally amoral. Its strongest feature is its script which is sharp witty and extremely funny with lots of quickfire dialogue that perfectly complements the fastmoving pace of this highly entertaining movie. The Hitchcock and Tarantino influences are very apparent throughout and the combination of a mistaken identity story with colourful anecdotes and amusing banter provides plenty of humour suspense and intrigue.When two strangers meet in an almost deserted airport waiting area the man in a wheelchair tells a younger man a story about an ordinary guy at a racetrack twenty years earlier whose decision to put money on a horse which was supposed to be a surefire winner led to his own violent demise and the deaths of his immediate family. After completing the story the wheelchairbound raconteur suddenly gets up and kills the younger man.A short time later in New York City Slevin Kelevra Josh Hartnett is staying at his friend's apartment because after having come to visit Nick Fisher he'd found the door unlocked and Fisher had disappeared. In a conversation with Nick's neighbour Lindsey Lucy Liu he explains how recently he'd experienced a lot of bad luck including losing his job finding his girlfriend in the act of cheating on him and getting mugged. More bad luck then follows when a couple of heavies who mistake him for Fisher take him to meet a gangster called The Boss Morgan Freeman who demands that he repay a huge gambling debt. The Boss then explains that his son had recently been killed and as he believes that his rival The Rabbi Ben Kingsley was responsible he would be prepared to overlook the gambling debt if Slevin would agree to assassinate his rival's son.Slevin's decision about what to do next is made easier shortly after when a couple of The Rabbi's heavies who also mistake him for Fisher take him to their boss who demands repayment of another large gambling debt. Slevin agrees to carry out the hit for The Boss but there's also a hitman called Mr Goodkat Bruce Willis who strangely seems to be working for both gangsters and is under orders to eliminate Slevin after he's killed The Rabbi's son. When Slevin subsequently carries out his contract for The Boss a connection between Slevin and Goodkat is revealed and the two men surprisingly go on to capture the two gangsters before a series of additional twists and revelations including the relevance of the anecdote that was told at the airport follow.A wonderful cast of very talented actors who genuinely seem to be having a great time add enormously to the enjoyment of watching this movie. Josh Hartnett perfectly displays the reactions of a man who's faced with some terrifying situations but also weirdly suffers from a condition which leaves him free from worry or any other troubling preoccupations and Bruce Willis is great as the mysterious smirking hitman. Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley are on form as the crime lords who used to be partners and Lucy Liu is scintillating in her supporting role as a funny James Bond fan who also works in a mortuary.Considering the convoluted nature of the plot  director Paul McGuigan also merits recognition for the slick way in which the action is presented and the level of clarity that's brought to a tale that in the wrong hands could so easily have degenerated into a confusing mess.".

It relates the story apparently initiated through mistaken identity. A traveler visiting a friend accepts an invitation to stay at an apartment in another city. Once there however he meets Lindsey Lucy Liu a sexy next door neighbor is slugged and mugged in broad daylight just before he is kidnapped and threatened with death if he doesn't pay a great debt and do a favor for The 'Boss' a local Godfather Morgan Freeman. However he also realizes in order to fulfill the command he must kill a total stranger for 'The Rabbi' a rival Godfather Ben Kingsley. The reason for the duel threat dates back some twenty years and involves a professional Hitman named Mr. Goodkat Bruce Willis. The film is briefly confusing and further muddled if the audience doesn't pay close attention to the interesting players. Although a serious feature the inclusion of dark comedy makes for a black situation which is flavored with fast action and hard hitting excitement. Josh Hartnett plays Slevin Kelevra and holds his own against the heavyweight stars of the movie. All in all an unexpected and wonderful movie recommended for the thinking audience.

Ever since The Usual Suspects it seems that more and more movies have become too desperate to trick or mislead the audience and it seems that the people making these movies usually fail to realize what made the movies they're trying to emulate effective in the first place. The Usual Suspects was effective in misleading the audience because the plot is free of holes and there is one well thought out twist that is believable and makes for a great ending. What happens in Lucky Number Slevin is that the twists are too plentiful and the ones that aren't predictable are often trivial they end up having very little impact and aren't satisfying. The ending to Lucky Number Slevin is given away very early on. An astute viewer who has become used to seeing this type of movie will pick up on it right away. All that's left to us is to figure out which piece of the convoluted puzzle will be laid down next.The dialogue tries relentlessly to be witty to varying degrees of success. Sometimes it's funny sometimes it's downright tedious. The first scene in which Slevin meets the Rabbi is an example of the high the first scene with Slevin meeting Lindsey is the low.Director Paul McGuigan emulates Guy Ritchie's stylish visuals to some success and guides the film about as well as the material allows. The saving grace here is the characters. Slevin The Rabbi The Boss and Goodkat all stand out and Hartnett Kingsley Freeman and Willis all turn in commendable and charismatic performances. But by the end particularly if you've figured out the scam from early on the movie becomes a bit tiresome not offering up any real surprises. While Lucky Number Slevin is not without its good points at the end it seems like another case of a movie trying to be too clever for its own good another movie with multiple twists that fail to result in any real surprises and that just aren't that satisfying. As a viewer the final result is a been there done that too many times feeling even though the film is not without its moments".

I feel the only people who changed at all by movie's end were Freeman and Kingsleyand they end up dead! That's also assuming their characters learned the error of their ways right before Slevin kills them and even that assumption is probably a stretch.This Alist cast was wasted. I felt no emotion toward anyone involved and was relieved when the movie finally reached its only somewhat unexpected conclusion.I give this movie three out of ten stars for a script that is borderline insulting and for a typical notsomemorableorexciting story of revenge.To its credit it is mildly entertaining and worth at least some of your time and money.

To tell you the truth I'm getting a bit too tired of this clever oh so clever style of narration. The dialog coming out of Freeman and Kingsley mouth is as fun as it is meaningless. Absurd without being Ionesco absurd. Absurd but self consciously so. After a little while you're way ahead of the characters  not plot wise naturally but style wise. You know is going to be one of those movies trying to be those other movies. That in itself makes the experience rather frustrating. Thank God for Josh Harnett. He is an actor that manages to remind you of all those greats icons of the past and at the same time he's an original. The fact that I could actually see this movie again just to look at him makes me think he'll be a huge star. The kind of star the people remember and loves generation after generation. I wish he manages to find his Elia Kazan.".

To tell you the truth I'm getting a bit too tired of this clever oh so clever style of narration. The dialog coming out of Freeman and Kingsley mouth is as fun as it is meaningless. Absurd without being Ionesco absurd. Absurd but self consciously so. After a little while you're way ahead of the characters  not plot wise naturally but style wise. You know is going to be one of those movies trying to be those other movies. That in itself makes the experience rather frustrating. Thank God for Josh Harnett. He is an actor that manages to remind you of all those greats icons of the past and at the same time he's an original. The fact that I could actually see this movie again just to look at him makes me think he'll be a huge star. The kind of star the people remember and loves generation after generation. I wish he manages to find his Elia Kazan.";

	schema:headline " A very good Crime Mystery";
	schema:reviewBody "Rating810Lucky Number Slevin is a film that contains a bunch of elements that a gangster film needs and also a dash of comedy that brings it all well together. With a big cast of familiar faces and performances to match really I really would recommend this if not only to prove the critics wrong who don't like this film. I felt this film was safely very good and here is why below.The story is serious at most times but also doesn't mind being comedic and this makes it much more fun as you really get more interested in the plot. It starts to get complicated towards the end but in a good way actually as the whole mystery and shocks that go on are revealed in a simple and easy way. It contains fun moments too unpredictable and throws a few curveballs it just makes a very good piece of entertainment.Joh Hartnell in the main role is good maybe not the best that could have been done of this role but he works it well Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley as the two mob bosses are good as well but yet again they never seem to do the role as well as it COULD be done although it is steady going by all three. I did however think Lucy Liu fitted her role very well and portrayed a character that you didn't know much about really.It is written well and the script is the probably the strongest thing about this entire project. Directed well too the more technical side of this deals it's strongest cards and is why I rate as I have the sets though are dizzying and never seem to fit what is going on or any serious note the film is trying to find but they don't ruin this films credibility. Apart from the sets the main problem with the movie is that It wraps itself around itself in a sense and becomes very confusing at times mostly is isn't but it happens at certain parts which niggle down it's rating. I said about the acting which I did say wasn't bad but what I will say is that Bruce Willis completely wastes his talent in this with a bad performance that somehow never fits in with this piece.Those who like a good old action and mysterious plot should enjoy this as that is exactly what it turns out to be by the end and can be hugely enjoyable. It isn't the best of gangster film but could serve to please a fan of that type of film with it's two rival crime families although the comedy may take some gangster film fans away from this one.Overall I give this an 810 it is a Safely Very Good movie but maybe not quite enough to be rated as Great. With this you seriously have to ignore the critics who don't like this because it is hugely enjoyable if you just watch it straight enjoy the curves it throws at you and you will pleased by it hugely If you start to look into this well then you may feel it isn't quite up to scratch with others like this movie.".

It tells the tale of a man who makes a bet which he cannot pay off if he was to lose. In return the gangsters he owes money to kill his whole family.Josh Hartnett seemingly plays the friend of 'Nick' and finds himself in a case of mistaken identity where Nick owes money to two very dangerous criminals. The Boss and the Rabbi.Josh's character Slevin begins to fall for Nick's neighbour Lindsey Lucy Liu and so he must find a way to play the two gangsters and a mysterious hitman known only as the GoodKat.The film has some great lines and plays on words perfectly. Josh Hartnett plays his part well. While Bruce Willis plays the silent hitman. Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley shine more then ever while Lucy Liu plays an adorable and bubbly character who sizzles sexy in every scene.The films is full of comedy yet it has a surprising element of action and keeps audience members on the edge of their seat. Bits are complicated but the characters take their time to explain what is going on.The best scene in my opinion was the bed scene were Lindey and Slevin talk about Bond. Just a great moment were nothing else matters no gangsters no debts or deaths.A great movie.".

What makes a thriller stand out is when you forget it's a thriller. Fight Club is just an epic fighting movie. Memento makes you concerned with figuring out what's going on much like he is trying to do. The Usual Suspects has you guessing at how the boat incident came to be and who Keyser Soze is. All of them make you forget you're watching a thriller and just leave you concerned with what is happening instead of what will end up happening. Lucky Number Slevin does this brilliantly. With one of the best scripts I've ever heard the film style and transitions are just as poetic a very unique and entertaining set up for a story and a constant introduction of interesting characters it makes you forget why any of it is related to the opening scenes. Whether or not you love the movie you must respect what a masterpiece it is the amount of thought that went into every line and transition is impressive and if you consider yourself a critic in any sense you won't be let down.Now as far as Lucky Number Slevin being compared to The Usual Suspects I think Slevin trumps. If any comparison is to be made it's that Slevin fixed all the problems with Suspects. In the first five minutes I knew who the mastermind was because they showed him and had him talk one of the most obvious things I've ever seen. Slevin doesn't do that only one face is shown and that's because he is telling the story. Also Suspects doesn't have anything really unique to it the structure isn't that special and besides a few good quotes it can't compare to Slevin. Slevin and Suspects are completely different and I would never think judge one from the other. If you want to see a pioneer for thrillers see Suspects. If you want to experience a script story and film style come together virtually flawlessly see Slevin.".

	schema:reviewBody "John Hartnett secures the record for Longest Period of Time Wearing a Towel and Nothing Else in Lucky Number Slevin a groaninducing title for a groaninducing movie. After what seemed like at least a good halfdecade of hibernation yet another hack filmmaker has emerged from the bushes and taken his suckpump to dredge the remaining puddles of silt at the bottom of the nowdrained Tarantino Lake Jason Smilovic penned this toofamiliar tale of criminals with ohsoenigmatic names The Boss The Rabbi Slevin speaking in a torrent of popculture clichs James Bond Norman Rockwell Andy Griffith and Alfred Hitchcock get shoutouts involved in some ohsowacky ohsoironic ohsopostmodern shenanigans and director Paul McGuigan put the franticallyedited mess up on screen for all to see. When you notice the missed beats in the dialog between Bruce Willis whose persistent smirk seems to be holding back laughter and another character during the opening scene it doesn't bode well for the remainder of the film...and Slevin just gets progressively worse. The characters are a collection of pretentiously selfaware ciphers and following the plot is pointless since the film uses the LAST 30 MINUTES to tell us what the hell is going on via dialog and flashbacks whereyupinformation that was withheld is now revealed! because its structure is so tediously contrived. In any other case Slevin's unusually excellent cast would at least somewhat redeem the film but veterans like Morgan Freeman Ben Kingsley and Willis seem to be going through the motions of a flat unmemorable script meanwhile Lucy Liu and Josh Hartnett radiate youthful cuteness but precious little sympathy.

	onyx:emotionText "John Hartnett secures the record for Longest Period of Time Wearing a Towel and Nothing Else in Lucky Number Slevin a groaninducing title for a groaninducing movie. After what seemed like at least a good halfdecade of hibernation yet another hack filmmaker has emerged from the bushes and taken his suckpump to dredge the remaining puddles of silt at the bottom of the nowdrained Tarantino Lake Jason Smilovic penned this toofamiliar tale of criminals with ohsoenigmatic names The Boss The Rabbi Slevin speaking in a torrent of popculture clichs James Bond Norman Rockwell Andy Griffith and Alfred Hitchcock get shoutouts involved in some ohsowacky ohsoironic ohsopostmodern shenanigans and director Paul McGuigan put the franticallyedited mess up on screen for all to see. When you notice the missed beats in the dialog between Bruce Willis whose persistent smirk seems to be holding back laughter and another character during the opening scene it doesn't bode well for the remainder of the film...and Slevin just gets progressively worse. The characters are a collection of pretentiously selfaware ciphers and following the plot is pointless since the film uses the LAST 30 MINUTES to tell us what the hell is going on via dialog and flashbacks whereyupinformation that was withheld is now revealed! because its structure is so tediously contrived. In any other case Slevin's unusually excellent cast would at least somewhat redeem the film but veterans like Morgan Freeman Ben Kingsley and Willis seem to be going through the motions of a flat unmemorable script meanwhile Lucy Liu and Josh Hartnett radiate youthful cuteness but precious little sympathy. Actually the one smidgen of talent on display in Slevin might be McGuigan's ability to squander a cast most directors would kill fornow THAT is a true achievement. For those who have never seen a good crime thriller and would like to look 'hip' and 'with it' have a ball with Lucky Number Slevin the rest of us will be rewatching The Usual Suspects and Pulp Fiction.";

It took me some time to warm up to the film the pace is extremely sluggish the aftermath of the trainwreck at the beginning seemed interminable while the allimportant decision to exchange the damaged hands of famed concert pianist Orlac with those of a murderer felt too abrupt.In preparation for this review I reread Michael Elliott's comments on the film while I generally concur with his opinion at this stage I wouldn't put this above the 1935 Karl FreundPeter LorreColin Clive remake MAD LOVE Ted Healy's intrusive comedy relief to me is just about the only negative element in that film  while adding Dr. Gogol's obsessive yearning for Orlac's wife hence the new title. Still I was surprised by how much the later film actually followed the Silent version  especially the two scenes in which Orlac meets the 'executed' murderer  of the Maurice Renard story another remake appeared in 1960 costarring Christopher Lee and which I watched on Italian TV not too long ago but already can hardly remember anything about it! Conrad Veidt's lanky figure and stylized approach to acting perfectly suited the requirements of the leading role his posture generally echoing that of Cesare the Somnambulist in the same director's THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI 1919 the expressionist sets were also notable but the film's style is generally an internalized one in that it deals primarily with Orlac's state of mind filming him in tight shots whenever possible. However the avantgarde score which accompanied the Grapevine Video edition I watched was a matter of taste  featuring a female vocalist who frequently attempted to simulate the various characters' emotions with an annoying array of wails shrieks and faint whispers! It's unfortunate too that the backlog I have of unwatched films on DVD doesn't permit me to check out the Kino edition of CALIGARI for the moment  especially since it contains a lengthy condensed version of another intriguing Wiene title GENUINE A TALE OF A VAMPIRE 1920".

	schema:reviewBody "I've been looking for a DVD of THE HANDS OF ORLAC ever since I knew the film existed. Now it's finally here and like most silent films it's a mixed bag. I find the image on the new KINO disc to be acceptable considering the problematic nature of the source material. There's a loss of definition in some scenes but there are also moments of sharpness in the restored Murnau Foundation print. It's a shame we can never experience nontalking films the way 1920s audiences did without washedout contrasts imageflickers framejitters dirt and print damage. Even the best restorations don't look new.The plot concerns a concert pianist whose hands are smashed in a train wreck. A surgeon replaces them with the hands an executed criminal. Soon the pianist is obsessed with thoughts he might be a killer. The performances are generally excellent in the Expressionistic style. Conrad Veidt's exaggerated grimacing as his character Paul Orlac approaches madness is tempered by moments that are extremely moving.The score of mostly string music on the KINO disc is creepy and works well for a while but is so monotonous over the entire length of an already ponderously paced film that I grew tired of it. This film cries out for music that varies its mood to fit what is happening on screen. Contrasts in the mood of the music would make the creepy parts seem even creepier. An optional score in a traditional style would have been nice. Nevertheless the Gothic set design and shadowinfested cinematography by Gunther Krampf  particularly the scenes at Orlac's father's house  create the atmosphere we know and love in early horror films. These chiaroscuro lightandshadow effects just cannot be achieved with color.However to evoke fear without the modern cheats of gore and violence  to create what the Germans call stimmung mood  requires not only imaginative lighting and set design but time. Unfortunately director Robert Weine spends too much time on the actors' very deliberate expressionistic movements at the expense of pacing.The ending is likewise unsatisfactory although it does follow Maurice Renard's novel. I won't give too much away other than to say the ending undercuts an apparently fantastic element yet makes the logical explanation seem almost as implausible. Nevertheless the buildup to the resolution as well as Veidt's engrossing performance makes this a worthwhile if uninspired film.".

While traveling back home there is a train wreck at Montgeron and Orlac is very injured in both hands in the accident.Yvonne begs to Dr. Serral Hans Homma to save his hands that are his life. Meanwhile the robber and murderer Vasseur that claims that is innocent is sentenced to death since the police investigator had found his fingerprints everywhere near the victim. Dr. Serral transplants Vasseur's hands in Orlac and when he recovers he feels that there is something wrong with his hands.Orlac asks the surgeon about the hands and learns that he belonged to a criminal and Orlac decides to never touch Yvonne again with those hands. His family becomes poor since he is not working anymore and Yvonne pays a visit to her fatherinlaw Fritz Strassny to ask for help. However Orlac's father is a cruel man and does not help her. When Orlac returns home Yvonne asks him to visit his father and when he arrives at his house he finds his father dead. They call the police and they find Vasseur's fingerprint everywhere. Orlac is the only heir of his father fortune but sooner he is followed by a stranger named Nera Fritz Kortner that blackmails him and demands a small fortune. Orlac is not sure that he had killed his father and goes with Yvonne to the police. Sooner they discover a secret about Vasseur.Orlacs Hnde is a Gothic and dark German Expressionist film with an unbelievable plot but who matters? but wonderful theatrical performances like in most silent classics and perfect use of shadows in a gloomy atmosphere. The music score fits perfectly to the film and this is the first time that I watch this little masterpiece. My vote is eight.Title Brazil As Mos de Orlac The Hands of Orlac".

Dr. Serral transplants Vasseur's hands in Orlac and when he recovers he feels that there is something wrong with his hands.Orlac asks the surgeon about the hands and learns that he belonged to a criminal and Orlac decides to never touch Yvonne again with those hands. His family becomes poor since he is not working anymore and Yvonne pays a visit to her fatherinlaw Fritz Strassny to ask for help. However Orlac's father is a cruel man and does not help her. When Orlac returns home Yvonne asks him to visit his father and when he arrives at his house he finds his father dead. They call the police and they find Vasseur's fingerprint everywhere. Orlac is the only heir of his father fortune but sooner he is followed by a stranger named Nera Fritz Kortner that blackmails him and demands a small fortune. Orlac is not sure that he had killed his father and goes with Yvonne to the police. Sooner they discover a secret about Vasseur.Orlacs Hnde is a Gothic and dark German Expressionist film with an unbelievable plot but who matters? but wonderful theatrical performances like in most silent classics and perfect use of shadows in a gloomy atmosphere. The music score fits perfectly to the film and this is the first time that I watch this little masterpiece. My vote is eight.Title Brazil As Mos de Orlac The Hands of Orlac";

Austrian director Robert Weine who created the landmark 'The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari' 1919 here reunites with and directs its star Conrad Veidt as the tormented pianist Paul Orlac.The camera focuses on Veidt's many moods and reactions to his plight  his hands are not capable of his concert abilities and he feels that they are taking him over with thoughts and deeds of crime and murder. He does an outstanding job but too much of the film is slowly paced. From the beginning extended train crash rescue on through scene after scene of Orlac's his wife's and the maid's over the top Expressionistic gesturing the scenes seem to go on too long. This slow pace is exaggerated by the lack of camera movement everything is mostly wide shots with little tracking the wonderfully and effectively spooky new musical score on the KINO 2008 version that sometimes lacks verve and variety as well as the extensive time spent on the actors' Expressionist movements.The film certainly has its high points. It's great to see an entire film shot in shadows and low light all with Gothic sets. This is great German Expressionism. If you can relax and just go with the pace of the film you can really enjoy the acting of Conrad Veidt whose hands keep getting creepier and scarier.If it were cut to about sixty minutes to pick up the pace it would be easier to enjoy and to see the great care that went into its creation and execution. I'll have to give it a six.".

	schema:reviewBody "Interesting and well made German silent version of Maurice Renard's novel Les Mains d'Orlac from the same folks behind the highly regarded expressionist classic THE CABINET OF DR.

He soon begins to think he's not only received a maniac's hands but also his desire to commit crimes. The cavernous and sparsely decorated interiors as well as the typically exaggerated performances often give this the feel of a theatrical production and while the movie is a little overlong and slowgoing definitely requires a more patient type of viewer to appreciate it it's still worthwhile for Veidt's amazing performance some nice visuals and a surprise twist ending. I also need to point out that the Kino DVD of the film runs 110 minutes though it is listed here as running just 98. Bonus features on the disc include scene comparisons of domestic and international cuts excerpts of Renard's Novel an essay by author John Soister a trailer and an image gallery.The same tale would later be the basis for 1935's MAD LOVE starring the inimitable Peter Lorre and 1960's THE HANDS OF ORLAC starring Mel Ferrer and also with supporting turns from Christopher Lee and Donald Pleasence as well as the uncredited basis for 1962's HANDS OF A STRANGER and several other films.".

	schema:headline " I give them a hand! The Hand of Orlac is pretty creepy. Hands down an excellent film";
	schema:reviewBody "There is nothing creepier than watching a 1924 German Expressionist silent film. While this movie didn't had those wildly nonrealistic geometrically absurd sets. We did get those designs motifs painted on walls and floors to represent lights shadows and objects. It doesn't have gore or much violent it deals with the stimmung type mood of madness insanity and betrayal. Directed by Robert Wiene of 'The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari' fame the movie follows the plot of the story 'Les Mains d'Orlac' by Maurice Renard. The film was one of the first film to feature hands having a will of their own whether if it's attached to the body or not. Such fear came from the ignorance by the public on the thennew subject of surgical transplants. I love how the film is shot. There's a constant intercutting between closeand mediumshots to extreme long shots of these excessively large rooms with large expanses of empty space. It's a metaphor of the main character's existential distress and then a giant hand coming out to reach him. The hand dreams are pretty scary even with today's standards. The movie is about a gifted Concert pianist Paul Orlac Conrad Veidt whom on his way to visit his wife Yvonne Alexandra Sorina lose his hands in a horrible train crash. His wife Yvonne pleads with the surgeon to try and save Orlac's hands. Instead the surgeon decides to transplant new hands onto Orlac. Orlac recovers from the crash only to find out that he is unable to play the piano. Not only that but Orlac starts to be tortured by memories of a recent murder in the community. He finds himself going mad whenever he is in the presence of a knife. Such a presence has cause him to want to kill and cause violence. He starts to believe that the hands he got are the hands of a murderer and he has to find a way to stop it. I think without a lot of make up or any real special effects. For a silent film star Veidt is great in this with his body language. Some scenes might seem a bit over acting but for the most part Veidt manages to make the film into an intense thriller. The movie makes you think if it's all in his head or is he really killing people? As humans we've always been fascinated superstitiously by the way our own bodies work and where our own consciousness lies. The movie borderlines the themes of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. The movie also reminds me of Faust. This movie was often remade. The most famous version is 1935's Mad Love. Other films follow are 1962's Hands of a Stranger 1946's The Beast with Five Fingers and 2012's Les Mains de Roxana. It also loosely adapted in Oliver Stone's 1981's The Hand. It also seem to appear in the Futurama season four finale episode 18th 'The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings'. The movie is a bit rare so finding it might be a challenge. The movie is in the public domain so there is a lot of DVD versions to choose upon. Depending what version you find depends on how good the film preservation or film restoration. Surprising the movie copy version I watch was pretty good. It had little scratches decay dirt or film grain. That doesn't mean that your version will be as good as mine. Some version had the original film cut to some extent by the German government at the time then Nazis later on due to censoring as they felt that it endanger public safety and order. They thought it could be used as a tool for criminals because it show a realistic method of forging fingerprints. While the movie was made before there was a rating system there was age limit for people to see this film. I think it's less about the frighten horrors and more on what the hands represented. There is a sexual motif that get established right at the start with how Orlac's wife would be touch by his hands. The original German intertitles have an even more erotic tone to it. The hands represent the sex life between husband and wife in the film symbolism. In 1996 the film was reevaluated and released with PG or PG13 age limit rating. In my opinion it's might frighten little children if watch. The original version is about 92 minutes long while the reconstructed version is 90 minutes. The restored version with all the cut scenes is 113 min. So make sure you're getting the full version. Some versions had newly inserted music scores by FriedrichWilhelmMurnauStiftung Henning Lohner Paul Mercer Donald Sosin Dennis James or others. Background noises might be missing in some version. Make sure you can hear the sound effects during the interrogation scene. The version I had also had English subtitles. Many of the versions are sadly just in German or in some other European language. In no way should you ever watch a color version. Its takes away the German Expressionist feel to film. You would never notice the shadowinfested cinematography by Gunther Krampf particularly the scenes at Orlac's father's house. I love the use of Chiaroscuro using a stark contrast between dark and light in an image usually for dramatic effect in some scene. You would deeply be sadly if you watch it in color. The Kino version is one of the better video transfer from the source material so check that out if you want. You can also find the film on Youtube. The ending is mixed feelings although it does follow Maurice Renard's novel it's not the best. Another fault of the film would be its pacing. Overall A great watch. You got to get your hand on this.".

The ending is mixed feelings although it does follow Maurice Renard's novel it's not the best. Another fault of the film would be its pacing. Overall A great watch. You got to get your hand on this.";

Veidt's portrayal of Orlac's descent into near insanity occasionally draws on Cesarethe somnambulist of Dr. Caligari but the story does not have the depth or psychology of the wider impressionist canon.

As the story goes a concert pianist Conrad Veidt has his hands damaged during a train wreck but doctor's do a transplant and accidentally give him the hands of a killer. Soon afterwards the hands take on a life of their own and start killing. Here's another German Expressionism horror film that really takes control of the viewer and takes them for a ride. The director Robert Wiene also made the masterpiece The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and this film serves as one of the more chilling silent horror films. The best aspect is the performance from Veidt who I found just as good here as he was in The Man Who Laughs. He's able to get sympathy out of the character and he also manages to be very menacing during the murder scenes. The film also has some very eerie and creepy moments including the first scene where the hands come to life. This is a rather rare film and various versions are out there. I was able to view the longest cut of the film 93 minutes but the title cards were in German with Spanish subs. The music score was also quite horrid so I actually turned the sound off while watching this. With a proper screening I'd certainly raise the rating.".

	schema:headline " Robert Wiene's ultraexpressionist exercise in Gothic terror";
	schema:reviewBody "It's always odd to me that when discussing the directors of the German expressionist movement in cinema Robert Wiene's name is generally omitted from the conversation. Of course The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari specifically is often mentioned but Wiene himself rarely is. Instead the big three of German expressionist cinema  Fritz Lang F.W. Murnau and Georg Wilhelm Pabst  seem to get all the attention. The reason I say I find this odd is because from what I've seen Wiene is clearly the consummate expressionist among the group. Lang Murnau and Pabst were great filmmakers but a lot of their work from the '20s isn't even expressionistic to begin with. One of Pabst's early films was a work of New Objectivity an early movement in cinematic social realism  or in other words the polar opposite of the formalistically inclined expressionist movement. Half of Lang's and Murnau's respective silent bodies of work could be considered nonexpressionistic and even their expressionistic work pales in comparison to the sheer psychological angst exhibited by films like The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and The Hands of Orlac which embody the expressionist modus operandi far more fully than any film I've ever seen by Lang Murnau or Pabst. Wiene is simply the most unrelentingly expressionistic filmmaker I've seen from the silent era. The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari with its surrealistic painted backgrounds conveying a distorted twisted German landscape  and by extension a distorted twisted German mentality in the wake of World War I  was highly innovative for its time. The Hands of Orlac if possible is even more expressionistic although the overall aesthetic is different here than it was in Wiene's previous film. Firstly there's no color tinting here. This was crucial to the film. Color tinting in general I think takes away from a film's artistic integrity and here especially the stunning blackandwhite cinematography would have been completely destroyed by the use of tinting. Truly the cinematography is brilliant in The Hands of Orlac as much as I've seen in any film from the silent era. The atmosphere is so thick the mood so dark the style so Gothic the tone of the film so heavy and bleak that the film's aesthetic takes on an uncannily palpable texture. The lighting is fantastic. The use of darkness and shadows is a hallmark of expressionistic cinema but never realized more masterfully than it is here. I was reminded very much of the film's of David Lynch namely Eraserhead Lost Highway and Inland Empire films which refined the expressionist mode of cinema to its most viscerally and sensorily potent form. Unfortunately the film's weakness is in the narrative. The mood and tone and atmosphere of the film are so amazingly brilliant that any elements of plot and story are secondary in priority if not all together superfluous. But the film is based on a novel and Wiene puts too much emphasis on realizing the narrative aspects of the source material. The actual action of the film is almost entirely redundant. Everything that needs to be said is said through the film's form not its content and yet too much attention is given to the content by the filmmaker. The ending of the film specifically is where it begins to lose traction. The film falls apart to some extent in the last twenty minutes or so because it offers too much resolution. This is a flaw we see in virtually all German expressionist films and in silent cinema in general from this time period. The medium of cinema was still in its childhood and hadn't yet learned important facets of the art of filmmaking such as subtlety ambiguity et cetera. Lynch's gift was his ability to take expressionism to the next level by doing what Wiene was unable to do here which is to apply on a content level not just a formal one the anxiety and fear and bleakness that define the expressionist movement. Formally Wiene captures the essence of expressionism impeccably with this film but where he falls short is in transposing this essence from the film's form to its content. This can be done in a multitude of ways. Lynch did it by denying his audience almost any resolution whatsoever to the narrative leaving the viewer alienated and uncomfortable and thus enhancing the visceral impact of the viewing experience.That however is my only criticism of the film along with the fact that at times the acting is overwrought. The exaggerated gestures and histrionics are somewhat like the horror equivalent of what you'd see in an early D.W. Griffith short for Biograph. This is common in silent cinema though and overall the film has more than enough strengths to compensate for any shortcomings.If The Hands of Orlac is narratively flawed it's flawed in the execution of that narrative not in its premise which has a strong thematic core revolving around notions of personal identity manipulation submission and the psychology that drives human action. Where does the essence of our natures as individuals come from? It is physical or mental? Does it originate in the body or in the mind? Wiene's film as well as presumably the source material that it's based on seems to suggest the latter and this is consistent with German expressionist cinema in general which places a strong emphasis on the psychological from the psychic powers of Lang's Dr. Mabuse villain to Pabst's Secrets of a Soul the original film about psychoanalysis.Along with Murnau's Faust and Sunrise A Song of Two Humans this may be the best German silent film of the thirtyplus I've seen. It's unique and it's formally brilliant by any and all standards. I recommend it to fans of German expressionism of silent films in general and of cinema of any kind.RATING 7.67 out of 10 stars".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched THE HANDS OF ORLAC on TMC when they featured at least three maybe four movies dealing with the subject of hands. The first was HANDS OF A STRANGER which is based on this silent film. However when I recorded THE HANDS OF ORLAC I hadn't realized that is was a silent film. I find them to be very slow and plodding which this film was. However it was also very confusing. There was one character introduced early in the film interacting with the maid but we didn't know who he was and I won't spoil it for anyone. But the dialog just didn't make sense in the context of the film. The cinematography especially during the scene with the train was very impressive but after that the lighting was inconsistent and very dark. The plot was fairly linear but there were a number of jump cuts that seemed jolting. The idea of transplanting human body parts seems very much ahead of its time just as The Modern Promethius was ahead of its time. It was a good watch but it was a long two hours.".

	onyx:emotionText "I watched THE HANDS OF ORLAC on TMC when they featured at least three maybe four movies dealing with the subject of hands. The first was HANDS OF A STRANGER which is based on this silent film. However when I recorded THE HANDS OF ORLAC I hadn't realized that is was a silent film. I find them to be very slow and plodding which this film was. However it was also very confusing. There was one character introduced early in the film interacting with the maid but we didn't know who he was and I won't spoil it for anyone.

	schema:reviewBody "I realize this movie was a true original. Well kind of anyway. Maurice Renard wrote the novel in 1920 and he wrote the original mixedup transplant novel in 1908 about organs being transplanted not just from human to human but to animals plants and even machines. One wonders what it must have been like to be Maurice Renard's room mate. But in fact maybe the whole business began with Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and lasted at least through the latest version of The Fly and Robocop. Anyway yes I realize the film is an original and that it was directed by the same guy Robert Wiene who had earlier given us The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari which I truly believe was dreamed up on some kind of amusement park ride.But man this is one slow slog. Example Conrad Veidt as Orlac has discovered his hands have been transplanted from a murderer and he sits brooding on the couch. Behind him stands his wife Alexandra Sorina staring at him without his realizing that she's there. I tried to time the motionless scene in which she stares at his back and he sits but my LED clock was in shadow and I couldn't read it. It must be thirty full seconds. Nothing happens. Finally she drops  verrry slowwwly  to her knees and creeps towards him until she's able to nuzzle his hand. Veidt jerks it away in disgust.I hate modern movies that are stylishly edited so that each shot lasts a fraction of a second but this was like watching actors move inside a huge vat of corn syrup. Sorina overacts too. Everybody is expected to overact in a silent movie but this goes a bit over the edge. Veidt the central figure has a handle on his role and projects emotions exquisitely. The doctor too reins himself in though that doesn't stop him from looking like a chump from the Keystone Cops.There's none of the looptheloop quality of Dr. Caligari. There aren't any surprises in the set dressing or the story itself once we get the picture. Although it's dark it's been beautifully photographed. Superb use is made of lights in nightfornight shots. The musical score is hard to assess. It sounds like The World Saxophone Quartet for strings full of extended shimmering dissonant chords and occasional weird shrieks and squeaks. I kind of enjoyed it.It was more or less remade ten years later as Mad Love with Peter Lorre in the role of a crazed doctor who performs the transplants. The victim is treated coincidentally. Mad Love goes nuts at the end. At least this one is grounded given the initial fantastic premise.But mind you it IS slow.".

In its original version the film ran roughly 90 minutes but the new version I saw has over 110 minutes probably because of less frames per second. Anyway Conrad Veidt is one of Germany's most known silent film actors so he certainly can carry a film like this. His most known role is probably in Casablanca. In my opinion the idea was nice in here. A piano player has a terrible accident and loses both his hands. A surgeon gives him a new pair but these are from a convicted and executed murderer. By now you probably know that this is a mysteryhorror film. The ending just takes it to another level. Yes it was fairly absurd that somebody else got the killer's head and now this was some meat puzzle story but at least something interesting happened. This thrill near the end however is not enough to sit through almost 2 hours of this film. I am generally not the biggest silent film fan so my opinion may be biased but i found it a boring watch for the most part. This film did not get me interested in silent movies. Not recommended.".

OK the movie is slow very slow in its movement focusing on the dark atmosphere and expression by gestures and facial which was common for these German expressionist films. However I do think it is rewarding though when we see how the story and mystery around Orlac's hands unfolds to a surprising and really clever and satisfying end result.

	schema:reviewBody "Set in the late 1880s in Cuba Luis Banderas a wealthy coffee magnate places an ad in a Maryland newspaper for a wife because America is the future. He tells his close friend She is not meant to be beautiful she's meant to be kind and true and young enough to bear children. You see Luis also thinks Love is not for me. Love is for those people who believe in it.  He just needed heirs. The boat is due in at 6AM they can be married at 9AM and I can be back to work by 10AM.The boat comes in he finds Julia Jolie who isn't homely at all but beautiful. She tells him she sent him a photo of someone else because she didn't want him to want her just because she was beautiful. To which he replies I'm not really a clerk with a coffee company I own the company. I didn't want you to marry me because I am rich. The we both cannot be trusted she says. some SPOILERS  The movie's title is aptly chosen. Julia is really Bonnie who along with Billy ran away from the orphanage at age 14 and the two of them have lived a life of deceptions ever since. In another version this film could have been called Billy the pimp and Bonnie the whore. Everything during the first half of this story was their murdering the real Julia on the boat then assuming her identity so that Bonnie and Billy could steal all Luis' money which they do after Luis foolishly converts all his accounts to joint accounts.I found the first half of the movie more interesting. Bonnie is narrating from a jail cell we know she was caught at something not sure what and they are preparing to execute her. The second half gets complicated as Billy posing as a P.I. gets into the mix. The problem Luis has is this even though he despises what Bonnie has done he falls inexplicably in love with her the person he finds in reality with all her good and bad.  She eventually reciprocates they both end up wanting to get rid of Billy. They do in an altercation when she shoots him.Bonnie at the last hour works one more deception convinces the priest in her cell that she is sorry and seeks forgiveness and he swaps clothes with her so she escapes right before her execution. In the end we see Bonnie and Luis in Morocco he is gambling she is serving and flashing secret signs for him to win by cheating. He started out as an honest man she was his Eve this has become his original sin.  I can recommend this film if for no reason than the remarkable job Angelina Jolie does with a script that doesn't deserve it. However it also tells a good story of how love in this case Luis' has power over life.  Most of us have done something out of character in the guise of love.  The cinematography is lush and surround sound is used for good effect. Terrence Blanchard New Orleans trumpeter adds a very good moodsetting soundtrack like the wailing and sensuous trumpet tune accompanied by percussion during the first love scene.".

I have to admit that a 5.6 rating is much different from what I would give this film.Original Sin seemed to be the movie that everyone walked away from. The only thing I remember about its opening was all the chatter about the nude scenes. I guess it reminded a lot of viewers about the whole Wild OrchidShowgirls fiasco which is still etched in the mind'seye of every selfconscious moviegoer. Perhaps this apparent smoke screen of an issue caused Angelina Jolie's often chapped and superpouty lips to be sealed regarding her role in the movie. Likewise the dependably silentaloof Antonio Banderas was even harder to locate when it came to any promotion of the film. And after making sure every radio listener heard The Music of My Heart even the inconspicuously conspicuous Estefans forgot to drop the hint that they contributed to the film's lushly romantic score.The fact that this was not a perfect movie didn't prevent it from being an excellent one. I think the film's real problem was that it couldn't quite fit into the typical Hollywood hype machine that has crowned more inferior material with nonstop publicity and gratuitously glowing reviews. It could also be due to the fact that the plot not a lovestory but a story about love didn't match the small space many viewers have reserved in their hearts for Romance and Drama  just not both!Anyone who takes the time to TRULY WATCH THIS MOVIE will find that they cannot walk away from loving it. Banderas and Jolie succeed in being both glamorous and gritty. Antonio Banderas is one of the most beguiling actors in contemporary cinema believe it or not. I am always amazed by the vast artistic depth that lays beneath the stereotypical Latinlover superbronzed matineidol exterior that he has been assigned to. Banderas' talents like this movie are grossly underrated and marginally explored. His every motion gives Vargas the pitchperfect blend of simplicity and passion. Banderas' portrayal makes it hard not to hurt when Vargas hurts or trust when he trusts. This makes it easy to see why the naive Vargas and the lethal JuliaBonnie are integrally compatible.Wacko Jacko antics aside Jolie in all her unGwynnethness is a site to have and behold. As the mysterious Julia she is one mailorder bride who can both sell her body and steal a man's soul. Jolie succeeds in revealing every aspect of Bonnie's internal struggle to achieve personal authenticity while accepting a onceinalifetime chance at true intimacy.In many ways the film is about humankind's universal need to be who we truly are as well as the long winding and often treacherous road toward love's salvation closely examine the play Julia  Vargas went to see. The movie's many twists and turns represent the bloody sacrificestransgressions that often mark the way. This was constantly echoed through a script which foreshadowed the story's theme in a manner both poetic and hypnotic. Equally intoxicating were the use of nontraditional cinematography and sound techniques. They perfectly complemented the periodheavy scenery and costume. All these elements melded to create a picture that was at once abundantly sensual visually stunning and emotionally sensitive  with an excellent ending!Oh and as for the much talked about skin scenes. I thought they were well done. Gratuitous yes. Gratifying  definitely! If you've got it flaunt it. Banderas and Jolie absolutely have it and thensome!".

	schema:headline " wow...";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie was surprising to put it mildly.  When I saw the cover I figured it was going to be just your typical dark love story...ha ha guess again. This movie was awesome!  Not only does it keep you guessing throughout the entire story you can't help but notice all of the eye stoppers.  The cinematography was absolutely stunning the filming locations were impeccable for beautiful scenery and spots and the graphic love scenes...well as much as I could have done without them they certainly did add a lot to the film.  Every part of the movie was exceptionally well done and I fell in love with this piece.If you're a movie buff like me you might remember a little film that came out in 1994 with James Spader entitled 'DreamLover'.  Now although that movie is surpassed by Banderas and Jolie's hit they do share a bit of the same flavor as one another.  I remember seeing the Spader flick on t.v. one night and thought it was really great however after seeing this I was reminded of the film and thought that they shared similar traits.  Though as I said before this movie was a lot better. Much more A quality bigger names bigger production and basically more money was spent making it which more often than not is a good thing and helps the film rather than hurting it.Jolie and Banderas have never been favorites of mine and in fact the only movie I ever liked Angelina in before this was 'Girl Interrupted' and Banderas in 'Two Much'.  This one though made me think twice about both the actors abilities on screen.  They executed such a great chemistry between one another.  I found myself even crying by the end of the movie. It is truly unlike any other movie I've ever seen.  Sure the premise was similar to others that I have seen in the past but the directing acting and just whole feel of the film was so unique and so on its own.  I loved it!  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a great intense romance.I would advice however that some of the scenes especially at the beginning are a bit crazy sexually that is.  Bare breasts and well just a whole lot of nakedness kind of take over the movie from time to time so parents caution.But otherwise I give the movie two thumbs up it rocked! I give it a 1010!  Great story about love!".

	onyx:emotionText "This movie was surprising to put it mildly.  When I saw the cover I figured it was going to be just your typical dark love story...ha ha guess again. This movie was awesome!  Not only does it keep you guessing throughout the entire story you can't help but notice all of the eye stoppers.  The cinematography was absolutely stunning the filming locations were impeccable for beautiful scenery and spots and the graphic love scenes...well as much as I could have done without them they certainly did add a lot to the film.  Every part of the movie was exceptionally well done and I fell in love with this piece.If you're a movie buff like me you might remember a little film that came out in 1994 with James Spader entitled 'DreamLover'.  Now although that movie is surpassed by Banderas and Jolie's hit they do share a bit of the same flavor as one another.  I remember seeing the Spader flick on t.v. one night and thought it was really great however after seeing this I was reminded of the film and thought that they shared similar traits.  Though as I said before this movie was a lot better. Much more A quality bigger names bigger production and basically more money was spent making it which more often than not is a good thing and helps the film rather than hurting it.Jolie and Banderas have never been favorites of mine and in fact the only movie I ever liked Angelina in before this was 'Girl Interrupted' and Banderas in 'Two Much'.  This one though made me think twice about both the actors abilities on screen.  They executed such a great chemistry between one another.  I found myself even crying by the end of the movie. It is truly unlike any other movie I've ever seen.  Sure the premise was similar to others that I have seen in the past but the directing acting and just whole feel of the film was so unique and so on its own.  I loved it!  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a great intense romance.I would advice however that some of the scenes especially at the beginning are a bit crazy sexually that is.  Bare breasts and well just a whole lot of nakedness kind of take over the movie from time to time so parents caution.But otherwise I give the movie two thumbs up it rocked! I give it a 1010!  Great story about love!";

	schema:reviewBody "The film's plot script and acting are only average but the film is buoyed by some sizzling chemistry between Jolie and Banderas. Their sex scenes are extremely memorable so make sure you get an unedited version unrated.Banderas plays a wealthy Cuban coffee farmer whose dedication to his trade has thusfar distracted him from the important business of finding a good wife. Using a matchmaker he agrees to marry a woman from Connecticuit. He has been dishonest however in describing himself as a man of only average means. Banderas admits his dishonesty to his new wife Jolie. However it soon becomes clear that there is more to her than meets the eye as well. Soon Banderas becomes so obsessed with Jolie that her lies destroy his entire life. He is well aware of what is happening every step of the way but he doesn't care.So this is an interesting movie for a few reasons. As stated above the sex scenes are among the best ever filmed. It is also novel to see a film about a man who is actually obsessed about his own wife. I personally could identify with Banderas in his willingness to give up everything for woman he knows he cannot trust. Heck it happens to the best of us.".

Original Sin can be added to the list but it's easily the worst of the lot giving us two stars who generate no heat and a story that isn't ridiculously convoluted enough to be trashy fun.  Really this movie's all talk without enough genuine passion suspense and not enough bare skin and I saw the unrated version.Antonio Banderas stars as an incredibly dumb coffee mill owner who's just been arranged to meet his mailorder bride.  He's written letters to her and has seen some pictures of her but when he meets her facetoface she's nothing like he expects.  The bride turns out to be Angelina Jolie whose sensuous looks and curves captivates our protagonist.  It seems she sent a different picture of herself so that a man won't be looking to marry her for her looks.  What a great deceptive star to their marriage.  Oh yes their marriage is bliss as they continuously make love and declare their love for one another.  But then it turns out she actually isn't his mailorder bride she's taken all his money leaving poor Banderas heartbroken and deadset to find her.  Enter Thomas Jane whose role is obvious from the start to any semikeen viewer.Original Sin is the kind of film that will probably have your eyes rolling from all the overdone dialogue Can't you see I cannot...LIVE without you?! and squirming in your seat as you wait for something important to happen.  Storywise well you'd be surprised how little plot there is. Aside from what I've described there's hardly anything else to be mentioned.  None of the plot twists are surprising or even amusingly overthetop so you'll probably find yourself tapping your feet out of boredom.This might have still been a somewhat engaging venture if I cared about the situation and the characters but no Banderas' is too gullible to root for and Jolie is...well...I've honestly never much liked Jolie she's always onenote with her performances and her huge lips and really creepy resemblance to Jon Voight her dad is a distraction that not even decent acting which she doesn't qualify for can account for.  The fact that both actors as well as Thomas Jane don't even seem to realize they're starring in such a trashy film only damages the film further.  They take this material far too seriously.The only thing worthy of note in this entire film is a somewhat graphic sex scene between Banderas and Jolie.  Cinema these days has grown rather tame with onscreen sex so I guess it's nice to see nudity on display in a bigstudio release though make no mistake even unrated this scene is not as graphic or even as welldirected as the sex scenes in Color of Night or Basic Instinct.  Unfortunately director Michael Cristofer manages to even screw up this scene giving us way too many dissolves fadeins and odd camera angles as if though he thought he was spicing things up.  No it just adds a yawn.  Hard to believe but Jolie managed to star in the two worst films of 2001 an accomplishment I don't think any other actor can boast.  As far as erotic thrillers go you'd be better off renting any of the films I mentioned above or better yet Brian De Palma's edgeoftheseat 1984 voyeuristic thriller Body Double.".

Still  it's OK.  Thomas Jane has some wicked fun playing a uh detective. B";

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS   SPOILERS I'm trying to remember a worse movie that I've seen....can't do it. Maybe it'll come to me before I finish this review. Let's see how to begin A rich handsome outgoing Cuban businessmanBanderas intentionally decides to screw up his life. Why?? Blankout. No answer. The Plan he decides that a bad marriage will be his downfall. Okay but how does one intentionally design a marriage to be so bad as to destroy oneself financially emotionally spiritually.MAJOR SPOILERS AHEADSince the antihero is handsome rich and outgoing he could easily marry one of any number of women most of whom would jump at the chance. Many of these theoretical matches might possibly work out. No no...there's got to be a worse way. I know the man must marry a complete stranger found via a newspaper ad placed in a foreign country. That's it. And to lessen the probability that she is compatible with the man the woman must arrive in the man's country no more than 3 hours before the wedding takes place. The man and woman must know nothing about one another except the lies they've exchanged with each other in establishing contact via the mail.Okay now here's the shocker. Are you ready for this. Hold on to your seat. Despite these elaborate plans to undermine the marriage from the start the marriage does not in fact work out and the man is destroyed financially emotionally and spiritually. What I have just related is the precise opening premise this movie expects you swallow in order to grab your attention for the movie's remainder. If it sounds implausible to the point of imbecility well that is not my fault.To be fair although this movie in no way deserves it the woman he marries is a con artistJolie who has helped kill the actual intended bride and assumed her identity. But that absolutely doesn't matter because it may just as well have been the con artist who answered the  man's marriage ad as any other woman.I really can't discuss this movie much further...the level of irritation Original Sin caused me makes it out of the question. Let me just say that the account I've related so far is not the most implausible element in the movie. For example let's assume for the sake of argument that you are a psychopath. Somebody tells you they love you a total of 999 times. But you are a psychopath and it has no effect. So you decide to poison the person who loves you. Hey it's what psychopaths do. Somehow the person finds out you've poisoned their drink and they tell you. Right before the person drinks the poison they tell you for the 1000th time that they love you. They knowingly begin to drink the poison. Suddenly the scales of psychopathology fall from your eyes and you see everything in a different light. You spring to your feet with all the goodhearted innocence that a recently cured criminally insane person can muster and try to knock the poisoned drink from their hands.Here are the crucial questions Do you find this plausible? Possible? Psychologically realistic? If so let me state in the strongest possible terms This movie was made for you.Hey I just had a revelation. I just remembered a worse movie I saw Ed Wood's Love Feast aka Pretty Models All In a Row. I knew I could do it!!".

But after that the movie fizzles out completely. The heat goes out of this movie very early on. The story relies on myriad plot twists which never really convince or satisfy. The dialogue is awkward throughout often downright laughable. The acting leaves much to be desired. Banderas and Jolie are not very good. But they're better than Thomas Jane who in the movie's one key supporting role hams it up to ridiculous extent. There are a few interesting moments sprinkled throughout. But not nearly enough of them to save what is ultimately a rather bad movie.The movie's story is told in flashback with Jolie's character Julia narrating. She does so from a prison where she is awaiting execution. How did she get there? Should be interesting finding out. Should be but really isn't. The story unfolds in 19th century Cuba with the Banderas character Luis having sent for a mailorder bride. Julia duly arrives from Delaware but she is not the woman in the photograph she had sent ahead of her arrival. She is not the woman she claimed to be but Luis is not who he claimed to be either much wealthier than he had let on. But while it becomes apparent that Luis truly has the best of intentions it is just as clear that Julia is a woman with some demons and secrets. What darkness lies beneath the surface? Detective Walter Downs played by Jane shows up to help Luis sort out the mess Julia makes. From here the story relies on tricks. But you can see the twists and turns coming a mile away. There's nothing to surprise you. There's really very little of interest at all. The story limps along towards its conclusion. Yes we find out why Julia's in that prison cell. But by the time we do most in the audience will find they really don't care anymore. The movie has completely lost its hold on us. And then as a final insult the ending is just ludicrously stupid a tackedon bit of nonsense which undercuts the whole movie. Not that there was very much worthwhile to be undercut anyway.".

	schema:reviewBody "contains a spoilerI guess MGM overestimated the moviegoers desire for this type of love story.  It is made very clear that this in no way was a love story but a story about love.  It seems that the main point of the movie was to show how love gets into your every pore where it makes a person incapable of being outside the intoxication of their complement.  Although this idea is both romantic and great in theory seeing it on screen was a bit sickening. Even the summary on the back of the dvd made me feel uncomfortable and nauseated. Angelina Jolie does an excellent job with this monstrosity.  She delivered my favorite line in the movie SPOILER Jolie He needs a doctor! cop what about him? bang Jolie he's dead now get him a doctor!Thinking about successful movies Original Sin should have been great because it included plot twists sex beautiful women beautiful men great acting and love.  Somehow I think is was just too overthetop.  I guess the mail order bride idea should have been abandoned after Nicole Kidman's Birthday Girl with Original Sin I felt the same twinge of hatred as I did for Birthday Girl.

	onyx:emotionText "contains a spoilerI guess MGM overestimated the moviegoers desire for this type of love story.  It is made very clear that this in no way was a love story but a story about love.  It seems that the main point of the movie was to show how love gets into your every pore where it makes a person incapable of being outside the intoxication of their complement.  Although this idea is both romantic and great in theory seeing it on screen was a bit sickening. Even the summary on the back of the dvd made me feel uncomfortable and nauseated. Angelina Jolie does an excellent job with this monstrosity.  She delivered my favorite line in the movie SPOILER Jolie He needs a doctor! cop what about him? bang Jolie he's dead now get him a doctor!Thinking about successful movies Original Sin should have been great because it included plot twists sex beautiful women beautiful men great acting and love.  Somehow I think is was just too overthetop.  I guess the mail order bride idea should have been abandoned after Nicole Kidman's Birthday Girl with Original Sin I felt the same twinge of hatred as I did for Birthday Girl.

When Sam arrives at his mansion in BelAir with chloroform he does not finds Barbara sooner he receives a phone call telling that Barbara has been kidnapped and asking a five hundred thousand dollar ransom. Further he is warned that he should not call the press or the police otherwise Barbara would be murdered. However fortyfive minutes later his house is surrounded by the police and the press and Sam is celebrating the abduction in his room without any intention of paying the ransom and expecting that the kidnappers kill Barbara for him. Meanwhile the clumsy and inexperienced kidnappers Ken Kessler Judge Reinhold and his wife and stylist Sandy Helen Slater have been lured in a business with Sam in the past when he stole a design of Sandy an raised a fortune and they are actually seeking a financial compensation for their loss however they are having difficulties to handle with Barbara in the basement of their lower mediumclass house. When Carol asks her stupid lover Earl Mott Bill Pullman to make a videotape of Sam killing Barbara Earl commits a mistake and records the Chief of Police Henry Benton William G. Schilling having kinky and noise sex with a prostitute in his car instead. Carol decides to blackmail Sam with the tape believing he killed Barbara and she sends a copy to Benton to press him to arrest Sam. Ken reduces the ransom to ten thousand dollars but Sam refuses to pay while Barbara loses twenty pounds working out while imprisoned and befriends Sandy. When Barbara discovers the intentions of Sam she decides to help the young couple to take Sam's money.Ruthless People is one of the funniest comedies of errors I have ever seen and reseen. The plot is excellent supported by a magnificent screenplay and wonderful performances highlighting Bette Midler and Danny DeVito. Bill Pullman in the beginning of his career is recognizable performing a tacky and stupid character. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Por Favor Matem a Minha Mulher Please Kill My Wife".

Bette Midler is also great as his whiny obnoxious wife.  It's good to see Judge Reinhold who practically disappeared after finishing the Beverly Hills Cop flicks.  An early performance by Bill Pullman is also worth checking out.  I think he's a real cool actor but he usually plays the same yuppie roles.  Here he plays a dimwitted trailertrash airhead and is a delight to watch.  There are so many funny moments that will stick in my mind forever like when the serial killer invades the house.  You look like my mother I hate my mother.  And the confusion that was created with the sex video was absolutely classic.  I haven't seen a good comedy in a while nor have laughed this hard in a while.  That's why I was glad to catch this movie on the Starz Network because it is one of the funniest comedies I've ever seen and nowadays you ain't gonna see too many good comedies nor great ones like this.  A MUSTSEE!!!My score  9 out of 10".

Every scene conveys something important either for the story or about one of the characters and not a moment feels wasted. The ensemble is terrific each actor landing hisher jokes without fail. The standouts though are Bette Midler who gives an outrageously vulgar performance pitched to the third balcony and Judge Reinhold who gives the film its heart.One of the most quotable movies ever the film also boasts a great opening credits sequence one more reason to lament the fact that movies hardly ever have opening credits anymore.Grade A".

It also sports a great ensemble cast. This was Bette Midler's real comeback. And Danny DeVito is delightfully nasty.

The phone then rings it turns out that Barbara has been kidnapped and the kidnappers want half a million dollars and total secrecy if he is to see her alive. He can't believe his luck and informs the police and media then waits for the kidnappers to keep their promise.

In a secondary plot Carol decides to blackmail Sam by filming him dumping the body of course there is no body but Carol's stupid partner films a couple's rather noisy love making and thinks he is witnessing a murder Sam enjoys the tape but the police chief doesn't as he is the man in it! As the film progresses the kidnappers lower their demands and Barbara uses her captivity as an opportunity to get fit.The actresses' hairdos may place this film firmly in the eighties but the film hasn't dated. Danny DeVito is great as the poisonous Stone a character who is as odious as he is hilarious. Bette Midler is equally good as his wife one can see why he wants her dead as she starts off as unpleasant as him. Judge Reinhold and Helen Slater are both on good form as bumbling kidnappers Ken and Sandy Kessler the most likable of the protagonists. The laughs are plentiful and the story is entertaining it is definitely worth watching and although there are a few slightly adult moments it doesn't descend into crudeness.".

	schema:reviewBody "Did I like Ruthless People? That is a tough question and just like every good story there are two sides. On the positive side I miss this type of comedy in cinema today. I miss the physical humor the goofiness and the instant creativity that could be seen behind the camera. In today's movie world this is normally cluttered with 'fart' jokes and sexual innuendo. I miss the comedies of the 80s there was some innocence to them. Perhaps it was that warm fuzzy feeling that they always left you with no matter if you were rooting for the bad guy or the good guy or maybe it was the actors of that era. The youth of today do not have actors like Danny DeVito who can now be found most of the time producing films Bette Midler Bill Pullman preIndependence Day and especially the infamous Judge Reinhold. What would my generation be like without the shenanigans of Judge? His humor was so perfect that if I were going to make a movie today he would be cast no matter what. I would also like to add that Danny DeVito was superb in this film. His ability to play the ruthless soulless antihero was amazing. He had me grinning from ear to ear whenever he was on screen.Another great aspect was the stories. They were simple yet imaginative. They were stupid yet somewhat funny. They were incoherent yet always ended on a happy note. Look at the story behind Ruthless People and look at the stories in today's modern cinema  see any similarities? I surely do not. There was something just plain 80s about the standoff scene with Reinhold DeVito and Pullman that could not be done the same today. There would be CGI or unmasking or anything that would detract from the main focus of this film  the actors. Films of this era were focused on the actors that is what sold the movie and made it popular. Today I wish we could say the same. Now it is all about the CGI and the explosions. It is very rare that you find a very actor centered comedy and for this I will forever be sad.As I stated above there are two sides to every story. While I did enjoy the actors in this film and the imagination there was something that tugged me the wrong way and that was story overloading. There was too much happening in this film. I totally disliked the side story with the Bedroom killer. I honestly felt as if this could have and should have been left out of this film. In a 93 minute film there was just too much happening. I didn't feel as if everything had a conclusion. There were parts still floating up in the air when the final credits rolled. Carol and Pullman's scenes were important in moving the story but I didn't feel they ever finalized anything. The problem that you run into when you try to push this much into 93 minutes is under developing some possible funny parts. I could have used some prestory on the Kesslers and even some more information on the random killer. The quickness of this film also lead to a quick ending for DeVito when I was finally starting to see the brilliance behind his character. I say this but perhaps this is what the 80s comedy was all about. An undeveloped story coupled with amazing comedic actors make for a decent film. Possibly but it still doesn't make Ruthless People rank up there with the likes of Ghostbusters and Quick Change. Overall this was a decent film. I first thought that it wasn't the greatest but the ending knocked it up a notch. The DVD quality really wasn't the best but I guess we are more concerned about the extra 50 minutes on LoTR instead of refurbishing some of our classics.Grade  out of ".

This clever and completely winning comedy stars Danny DeVito as Sam Stone an unscrupulous owner of a fashion company whose theft of a fashion idea from a young struggling designer turned him into a billionaire. In an attempt to exact revenge the designer and her husband decide to kidnap Stone's wife Barbara Bette Midlerfor an enormous ransom. Unknown to the poor couple Sam can't stand Barbara and refuses to pay the ransom. This is just the beginning and to reveal anymore to the uninitiated would be criminal but this sets the stage for a raucously funny comedy that became an instant classic. DeVito and Midler deliver razor sharp performances as the Stones. Helen Slater and Judge Reinhold are charming as the hapless designer and her husband. Also thrown in the mix are the late Anita Morris as Devito's sexy mistress and Bill Pullman in one of his earliest roles as the goof ball she's seeing on the side. This film generates laughs throughout with a few surprise twists and turns leading to a finale which will have you cheering. Don't miss this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've seen movies where people get kidnapped and there were pretty good but this one has got to be the most hilarious kidnapping movie ever. Judge Reinhold and Helen Slater play husband and wife who kidnap Bette Midler who's married to billionaire Sam Stone Danny Devito. You'd think that Sam would be heartbroken but no he's so happy he celebrates with a bottle of champagne. So he's happy meanwhile his mistress Carol is dating Bill Pullman. Wow talk about big stars you got Danny DeVito Bette Midler Judge Reinhold and Bill Pullman. This is one of Bill Pullman's first movies but I got to tell you even though he's been in tons of comedies this one has got to be his best! Danny and Bette have a lot of great moments to in this movie. Actually I think all the actorsactresses have tons of great moments that's because it is a great movie. I love this movie the problem was it didn't get a lot of publicity I remember the first time I watched the movie I had tears of laughter and I'm not talking about just a single tear on my cheek I could barely watch the movie cause I was dying of laughter. That's probably cause it was directed by Jim Abrahams David  Jerry Zucker the same guys who did the Airplane movies. The one thing I love about Zucker Abrahams and Zucker's movies is the credits. They have all sorts of little tidbits and things like that. Anyways watch the movie it's hilarious. I'm giving it a 10 I wish I could give it 10 because this really is the best movie I have ever seen and I've seen tons of them. So go ahead and rentwatch the best hilariouskidnapping movies ever!".

	schema:reviewBody "Not everyone will like this movie but there are many who do. My mom and I absolutely fell out of our seats laughing when we watched this my brother on the other hand barely cracked a grin. Anyway with an ensemble made up of people like Bette Midler Danny DeVito and Judge Reinhold what more could you possibly ask for? The way I see it this is a takeoff of any kidnapping story that you will see in the news or on true crime TV shows...only there's nonstop comedy at every turn. As my mom and I have said this is one movie that is not meant to be taken seriously.Mr. DeVito plays a husband who desperately wants to get rid of his wife who is played by Miss Midler herself. Then you have Judge Reinhold who plays one of the bumbling kidnappers. DeVito and Reinhold concoct a plan that is surely foolproof right? Not so much apparently. From the moment that she is kidnapped Bette tries everything in her power to buy her captors' trust and get out. Probably one of the most memorable scenes in the movie is when she is on the phone and letting off a string of obscenities that you have to hear to believe. My personal favorite line I've been kidnapped by K Mart! Every time I hear that line I can just picture her saying it and then I roll over laughing. In the very end Bette gets revenge on her husband and her primary kidnapper and walks off into the sunset. Can't go wrong with that if you ask me.From start to finish this is a comedy that you have to see to believe. Granted it may not be for everyone you may like what you see. Enjoy.".

	schema:reviewBody "What ever happened to the farce? As time has progressed pure movie comedies seem to be less about goofy overthetop characters and contrived situations and more about the characters themselves growing in unexpected ways and mining as much gold out of a singularly enjoyable premise. Think The 40YearOld Virgin 2005 or more recently The Big Short 2015 to see what I mean. The competing thought in American comedy is that of the vehicle a movie specifically designed for one actor or actress in mind. It's sad to think that in the last few years heck arguably within the last two decades we have not seen a good 'ol fashion farce come out of Hollywood. Honestly I think the only movie that ever came close to the delirious heights of One Two Three 1961 over the last decade was Crazy Stupid Love. 2011.Ruthless People is a relic a true blue unadulterated farce made by the same loons that made Airplane! 1980. Danny DeVito stars as businessman Sam Stone the repugnant spandex miniskirt king. In a bid to rid himself of his irritating wife gain her 15 million fortune and rid himself of her unhouse trained poodle Sam has a surefire plan to murder her without implicating himself. He comes home to do the deed Barbara Midler is nowhere to be found. The phone rings Sam picks it up and a man on the other line informs him his wife has been kidnapped and they expect a ransom. If you notify the police your wife will be killed. If you notify the media your wife will be killed. Naturally Sam is tickled pink. Thus a dozen or so fateful events and circumstances tie the lives of Sam Barbara the kidnappers Reinhold and Slater Sam's mistress Dodsworth her doltish Don Juan Pullman and a particularly nasty serial killer with mommy issues Freeman.The screenplay is written by the underrated Dale Launer based on an O. Henry short story. Launer's other credits include other well constructed and executed farces including Dirty Rotten Scoundrels 1988 and My Cousin Vinny 1992. Ruthless People however is his first screenplay thus the story occasionally suffers from a narrative lull as well as some conspicuously dropped exposition. The characters are perilously stock forged from the collective works of Shakespeare and Moliere and diluted to pander to 80's sensibilities. Yet despite all this the story is reliably funny seething with venomous cynicism and stitched together by the fun performances of Danny DeVito and Bette Midler.The direction however leaves much to be desired. A hit during its time Ruthless People has aged about as well as Weekend at Bernie's 1989 and Arthur 2 On the Rocks 1988. Part of it has to do with directors David Zucker Jerry Zucker and Jim Abrahams known collectively as ZAZ whom temper their knack for slapstick and anarchistic flights of fancy. Perhaps it's their desire to try something different or perhaps it's their inability to visually translate something they didn't write themselves but what results is soso physical comedy largely and disappointingly provided by Judge Reinhold's milquetoast face.Then there's the unmistakably 80's feel of the art direction. I realize the film is supposed to take place in glitzy Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles and I realize a lot of the characters are somehow involved in high fashion but for the love of God my eyes are bleeding! The angular decor nasty amalgamation of pastels and paisleys mixed with harsh primary colors makes it seem as if a bullet train ran into John Waters's walkin closet. Those who lived through the eighties and decide to watch this movie 30 years later please enjoy yourselves then go home and burn the rest of your spandex.Making a movie like Ruthless People today would be nearly impossible. Developing a screenplay basing its humor on goofy characters and miscommunication would seem out of place in an era of near constant communication. We deal with our own miniature farces everyday to be sure especially every time we talk past each other on social media. Yet those are not the type of misunderstanding that farce feeds on to create scenes of discomfort double meanings and giddy hilarity. In other words your Facebook feed has nothing on Ruthless People.".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie is a great 80's comedy about a rich man's wife being kidnapped by people he betrayed right when he wants her to be gone and who are not very good in doing it.It doesn't even start slowly. The first scene is a dialogue of Sam Danny DeVito and his mistress Carol Anita Morris where he passionately describes how much he hates his wife and how he wants to kill her so she suffers. Danny DeVito is great in this scene as through the whole movie. He does a great job playing the bad guy and his character seems to have so much evil energy and strength.Other characters are also very well selected and played. There are moments where it seems that Bette Midler is overplaying it but considering that the movie is to some point a farce comedy it doesn't seem to be too out of line. As well it gives her character the craziness that makes her a bit scary and yet lovely. The kidnapping couple Judge Reinhold and Helen Slater are greatly created characters they are so kind and nice that one just has to root for them and feel for them. They are so not made to be evil that their failings in it bring us a lot of amusement. To make it a bit more complicated throw in the mistress I mentioned before and her dumb lover a great career start for Bill Pullman who have their own shenanigans planned and the movie gets even more complicated and hilarious. One basically laughs at every scene and the 90 minutes pass by very quick.Sure it is predictable most of the time but it sure doesn't ruin the movie that is mainly made to make us laugh and truly accomplishes it both with plot related and the side jokes. I loved the movie when I first saw it must have been in the 90's and it still didn't lose it's humor for me 3 decades after it's release.It is actually funny that back in the days it was promoted as crude adult humor and now it seems to be so innocent. Times sure have changed the average comedy.".

Ruthless People is a classic example of the genre an extremely clever and funny film with a wonderful cast Danny DeVito Bette Midler Judge Reinhold Helen Slater Anita Morris and Bill Pullman.The story concerns a wealthy clothing manufacturer Sam Stone DeVito who wants to see his wife Barbara Midler dead and informs his mistress Carol Morris that he's going to kill her. The mistress sends her boyfriend Pullman to get the murder on tape so they can blackmail him. He gets something on tape but it's not Stone killing Barbara. Carol doesn't look at the tape and her boyfriend has never seen Stone so they don't know what they have. Sam isn't able to murder Barbara because she's been kidnapped by two nice people who just want some money Reinhold and Slater. Sam is thrilled  all he has to do is disobey all their orders not pay up and someone else will kill his wife.This is a very engaging comedy about blackmail attempted murder mistaken identity infidelity stealing ideas  none of which is a great premise for a comedy but all of which work beautifully here. Danny DeVito is hilarious and Bette Midler gives probably her best performance as his wife who just wants to lose a few pounds. Reinhold and Slater are as adorable as they are guileless.Highly recommended.".

	schema:headline " I Howled With Laughter Throughout This Film This Is So Sidesplittingly Hilarious";
	schema:reviewBody "Being born in the 80s there were many great films that came out during this decade and Ruthless People is just one of them. I didn't catch it first time round but when it was shown on TV during the 90s when I saw it for the first time I couldn't help but laugh my arse off. It was so hilarious and farcical it was awesome and the thing is you didn't know what was going to happen one scene after the other.Bette Midler and Danny Devito were fabulous throughout as Barbara and Sam Stone and Judge Reinhold and Helen Slater were just as good if not better than the two main leads. It was an interesting surprise to see Reinhold play a different type of role to the one that we usually associate him with as Det Billy Rosewood in the Beverly Hills cop franchise. Devito is nasty devious crude and yet at the same time he was also funny as Sam. Though arguably this has to be Midler's funniest and best performance in a film that she has turned in. She was a revelation throughout. One of the funniest lines she had uttered came when she was tied up in a chair and was confronted by two kidnappers reinhold and slater wearing duck masks 'oh my god! I have been kidnapped by Huey and Dewey!' LMAO! Bill Pullman was equally on form as well. The laughs and the gags came thick and fast and the longer it went on the more intriguing and interesting the story became as there were so many twists and turns what with the characters backstabbing and turning on one another from one situation to the next.I think it is brilliant the fact that Sam intended to go to great lengths to have his wife murdered by the very people he has hired to do soonly for them to side with and team up with her to get their revenge on Sam! Because as much as I think he cracks me up he is also an evil and manipulating little fill in the blanks!. Barbera is a hoot and I thought Bette Midler did justice to that role so perfectly I laughed at the wisecracks she made thanks to the brilliant writing that is by the Zucker Bros.The dark condescending humour was juxtaposed along with the often patronising wit and sarcasm of the characters lines within the movie itself. Ruthless People was dark comedy at its very best! There is no other film that can rival this type of comedy nor is there one that can match this. This was a riot from start to finish and the scene towards the end when Barbera and Sam fight and she pushes him into the water is just magic! Funny gags great plot wonderful timing from the actors part. what more do you least expect from this film i'd say?".

I didn't catch it first time round but when it was shown on TV during the 90s when I saw it for the first time I couldn't help but laugh my arse off. It was so hilarious and farcical it was awesome and the thing is you didn't know what was going to happen one scene after the other.Bette Midler and Danny Devito were fabulous throughout as Barbara and Sam Stone and Judge Reinhold and Helen Slater were just as good if not better than the two main leads. It was an interesting surprise to see Reinhold play a different type of role to the one that we usually associate him with as Det Billy Rosewood in the Beverly Hills cop franchise. Devito is nasty devious crude and yet at the same time he was also funny as Sam. Though arguably this has to be Midler's funniest and best performance in a film that she has turned in. She was a revelation throughout. One of the funniest lines she had uttered came when she was tied up in a chair and was confronted by two kidnappers reinhold and slater wearing duck masks 'oh my god! I have been kidnapped by Huey and Dewey!' LMAO! Bill Pullman was equally on form as well. The laughs and the gags came thick and fast and the longer it went on the more intriguing and interesting the story became as there were so many twists and turns what with the characters backstabbing and turning on one another from one situation to the next.I think it is brilliant the fact that Sam intended to go to great lengths to have his wife murdered by the very people he has hired to do soonly for them to side with and team up with her to get their revenge on Sam! Because as much as I think he cracks me up he is also an evil and manipulating little fill in the blanks!. Barbera is a hoot and I thought Bette Midler did justice to that role so perfectly I laughed at the wisecracks she made thanks to the brilliant writing that is by the Zucker Bros.The dark condescending humour was juxtaposed along with the often patronising wit and sarcasm of the characters lines within the movie itself. Ruthless People was dark comedy at its very best! There is no other film that can rival this type of comedy nor is there one that can match this. This was a riot from start to finish and the scene towards the end when Barbera and Sam fight and she pushes him into the water is just magic! Funny gags great plot wonderful timing from the actors part. what more do you least expect from this film i'd say?";

Clampett invented Tweety but only directed him in three cartoons before passing the character to Friz Freleng who moulded him into an irritating cutesy creature who starred in a series of repetitive chase films with Sylvester the cat. Clampett's Tweety was a totally different proposition. An anarchic shrieking featherless baby bird whose penchant for extreme violence and sudden hollering contrasts hilariously with his frail stature. 'A Gruesome Twosome' takes a long time to set up its premise of two cats one a grotesque Jimmy Durante caricature who are attempting to catch a bird to win favour with a lady cat. These early scenes are funny and extremely violent but things are knocked up a notch when Tweety finally appears. Tweety is in the cartoon for a relatively short amount of time but he makes the most of his brief screen time torturing a bee and a bulldog in order to rid himself of the cats. Brightly coloured and unusually designed Clampett's designs here are a throwback to the 30s character designs of Tex Avery showing Clampett's own status as a cartoon fan 'A Gruesome Twosome' is a thoroughly grotesque and utterly brilliant piece of work which always makes me sad that there were no more cartoons with Tweety as this cool character instead of the doeeyed irritant he became.".

While I've always tolerated him better than most and enjoy most of the Sylvester and Tweety cartoons he is much funnier better utilised and cuter in his early cartoons. By the late 50s he'd become little more than a plot device and become useless and annoying but here he is hilarious and not only does he look adorable even in 'development' stage but one really wishes that Freleng kept the refreshing anarchic personality that Clampett gave himsome of the early Freleng Tweety cartoons did but it was completely lost by the mid50s. The feline Jimmy Durante caricature is grotesque but brilliantly inspired and his competitor is very endearing for a character as dumb as he is in comparison. The love interest is nothing new but brings charm to the cartoon.In A Gruesome Twosome there is very little if at all to complain about the writing which is very fresh and witty with Tweety's line being some of the funniest he's ever had which is saying a lot. The gags are very sharply timed and are often hysterically funny violent they are but in a very fun way and not in a way that's sadistic. The story has so much charm and energy that the lack of originality conceptually is completely forgivable in this case it isn't always with me but there are reservations depending on the execution. Mel Blanc as ever does an amazing job with the three main characters bringing so much verve and individuality to eachwhich always was one of Blanc's strengths as a voice actor and Bea Benaderet does very well too though not with as much to do.Mustn't forget the animation or the music either because both here are outstandingly good. The animation is beautifully drawn and colourful and does contain some of the most inventive animation of any of Tweety's cartoons. The music is vibrant and characterful with much of the orchestration being gorgeous and rhythmically the music has so much life. As always with Carl Stallingwith Milt Franklyn as orchestrator the music matches the action and visuals so well and often adds to them.In summary brilliant the best of the three Clampettdirected Tweety cartoons and one of Tweety's overall best as well. 1010 Bethany Cox".

	schema:headline " Two cats fight over a baby bird to win over a girl but it's no ordinary bird it's Tweety bird and he's nobody's push over in this classic cartoon.";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a great 1940's Warner Bros. cartoon starring the iconic Tweety bird by my favorite cartoonist Bob Clampett. In today's pop culture Tweety is known for being a sweet canary who is always fighting Sylvester the cat who wants to eat him. But big fans of looney tunes know that in Tweety's first three cartoon appearances he was a lot different then he's known to be today. Bob Clampett created Tweety in 1941 after seeing a baby picture of himself and his Tweety was a featherless baby bird who fought cats who tried to eat him. But after three cartoons Bob left the studio and animator Friz Freling decided to team Tweety with his character Sylvester he also gave Tweety yellow feathers and made him a canarythat was partly due to the censored guys saying Tweety looked to naked. But Friz made Tweety very sweet almost innocent and oddly feminine causing for a lot of confusion of Tweety being a girl or boy. But Clampett's original take on Tweety was great and this is the best of Tweety's three original solo cartoons. But this is also one of the best of Clampett's cartoon. All the animators at Warner Bros. at this time were great and legends but Bob always amazes me with his zany cartoons. The cartoon has a great plot and a great set up to introducing Tweety. The opening is great with two alley cats fighting over a girl cat. The animation is fantastic with a lot of silly cartoonish violence. Bob brings so much personality to his characters the two cats who are the gruesome twosome are great. One is a dumb chubby yellow cat who influence the creator of Ren  Stimpy to create Stimpy. The other is a orange cat that's a hilarious parody of legendary comedianactor Jimmy Durant who was popular at this time. Who ever did the voice of the Durant cat did a great job. This cartoon has a lot of great visual gags. One great gag is when a dog comes out of nowhere and says I don't actually belong in this picture but I can't pass up this and kisses the girl cat while the other two cats were fighting. I love Bob's silly sense of humor. The two cats go looking for a bird to win over the girl cat and they find Tweety. It'a long build up that really pays off because once Tweety shows up he steals the show. I love how small and puny Bob made Tweety he looks defenseless against two cats but the twist is he might look small but he's much more then the cats can handle. I like his first scene the way he looks directly into the eyes of the cats and says his classic I taught I taw a putty tat. In his first three cartoons he has a great reoccurring line saying the poor putty tat he fall down and go BOOM! shouting the boom part. I like the song Tweety sings here  I taught I taw a putty tat a putty tat I know I taw a putty tat looking through my window. Bob's Tweety is so cool and full of attitude. I love the Slyvester  Tweety cartoons by Friz but Bob gives Tweety a great personality he's sassy wild and a little mischievous. I love how Tweety defends himself against the cats although one scene never made sense to me the cats dress as a horse to catch Tweety which dosen't make sense to me. How dressing like a horse is going to catch Tweety? Anyway the ending is great when Tweety tricks a dog to go after the cats. The animation of Tweety hitting the dog with a bone is hilariously great. While the dog and cats are fighting Tweety looks at the camera and says I lose more putty tat that way and then does a Jimmy Durant ha cha cha. This has a hip 40's style and I like the background drawings Mel Blanc's voice as Tweety and great music. Tweety Bird never been so cool!".

Bob brings so much personality to his characters the two cats who are the gruesome twosome are great. One is a dumb chubby yellow cat who influence the creator of Ren  Stimpy to create Stimpy. The other is a orange cat that's a hilarious parody of legendary comedianactor Jimmy Durant who was popular at this time. Who ever did the voice of the Durant cat did a great job. This cartoon has a lot of great visual gags. One great gag is when a dog comes out of nowhere and says I don't actually belong in this picture but I can't pass up this and kisses the girl cat while the other two cats were fighting. I love Bob's silly sense of humor. The two cats go looking for a bird to win over the girl cat and they find Tweety. It'a long build up that really pays off because once Tweety shows up he steals the show. I love how small and puny Bob made Tweety he looks defenseless against two cats but the twist is he might look small but he's much more then the cats can handle. I like his first scene the way he looks directly into the eyes of the cats and says his classic I taught I taw a putty tat. In his first three cartoons he has a great reoccurring line saying the poor putty tat he fall down and go BOOM! shouting the boom part. I like the song Tweety sings here  I taught I taw a putty tat a putty tat I know I taw a putty tat looking through my window. Bob's Tweety is so cool and full of attitude. I love the Slyvester  Tweety cartoons by Friz but Bob gives Tweety a great personality he's sassy wild and a little mischievous. I love how Tweety defends himself against the cats although one scene never made sense to me the cats dress as a horse to catch Tweety which dosen't make sense to me. How dressing like a horse is going to catch Tweety? Anyway the ending is great when Tweety tricks a dog to go after the cats. The animation of Tweety hitting the dog with a bone is hilariously great. While the dog and cats are fighting Tweety looks at the camera and says I lose more putty tat that way and then does a Jimmy Durant ha cha cha. This has a hip 40's style and I like the background drawings Mel Blanc's voice as Tweety and great music. Tweety Bird never been so cool!";

	schema:reviewBody "There's a fair amount of fun and humor in this entertaining spy comedydrama. Director Dick Clement has a firm grasp on his material and with the assistance of a very ingratiating cast of players he has presented us with a most agreeable movie. I particularly liked Norman Rossiter as a cheery villain  now that's a really grand idea which I think I'll use myself in my next Michaela Morris novel.

Director Dick Clement has a firm grasp on his material and with the assistance of a very ingratiating cast of players he has presented us with a most agreeable movie. I particularly liked Norman Rossiter as a cheery villain  now that's a really grand idea which I think I'll use myself in my next Michaela Morris novel.

	schema:reviewBody "Droll British spy comedy from the creators of 'The Likely Lads' and 'Porridge'  Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais. Tom Courtenay  in probably his best film role since 'Billy Liar'  is 'Gerald Arthur Otley' a lightfingered Portobello Roadbased antiques dealer. When we first see him he is in bed with his landlady who then evicts him not only for being behind with the rent but also for selling her furniture. Otley searches for somewhere to spend Saturday night. His friend 'Lambert'  the recently deceased Edward Hardwicke  lets him doss down on his sofa. Gerald wakes up on the grass near Gatwick Airport on Monday morning. Worse the police want him for questioning in connection with Lambert's murder. He runs from one problem into another  Hendrickson  James Villiers  and the lovely Imogen  Romy Schneider  grab him because they think he has secret information concerning a shady news outfit named I.C.S. which is in the market for secrets...Based on a book by Martin Waddell and directed by Clement  his first film  'Otley' is great fun boasting an impressive British cast  with the exception of Schneider . Courtenay throws off the one liners with an almost Groucho Marxlike expertise. For instance when his friend 'Jean'  Phyllida Law  refuses him a bed for the night on the grounds that the dog is in heat!. He retorts She's got nothing to fear from me!. He is no Bond of course but manages to scrape through every predicament he's in. There's a great guest appearance from the irreplaceable Leonard Rossiter as an assassin who when he is not killing people runs a chicken farm and coach service! Freddie Jones minces about as camp intelligence boss 'Philip Proudfoot' Alan Badel is suave as 'Alec Hadrian' and James Bolam is hilarious as Otley's friend 'Albert'. Schneider is given competition in the glamour department by Fiona Lewis cast as Albert's wife 'Lin' whom Otley has a thing for. Blink and you'll miss Robin Askwith and Kenneth Cranham! The sparky opening theme  'Homeless Bones'  is sung by Don Partridge and is as far removed from Shirley Bassey's 'Goldfinger' as is possible to imagine.Funniest moment  Otley's driving test. Killers give chase and Otley tries to throw them off causing chaos on the streets of London. The instructor  the brilliant James Cossins  is petrified as his client drives like Stirling Moss! Clement and La Frenais returned to espionage three years later for 'Catch Me A Spy' which starred Kirk Douglas and had Courtenay in a small role.'Otley' is not currently on D.V.D. which is strange as it really should be.".

From the extended opening as Tom Courtenay makes he way a good length of Portobello Road to the modest and quiet ending we smile but little more. Nevertheless the film is likeable and a pleasure to watch Coutenay is excellent Romy Schneider lovely though underused and James Villiers who must have appeared in every British film of the time does better than usual. There is also a great turn from Leonard Rossiter who almost brings the film to life singlehandedly. Maybe it was the time maybe it was writers La Frenais and Clement but this film is outrageously languorous and happy to almost stop now and again.

	schema:reviewBody "Tom Courtney is perfect as Gerald Arthur Otley from Martin Waddell's series of books about a wannabe antiques dealer who makes what living he can fobbing off small items of stolen merchandise . . . but who always stumbles into involvement with some arm of the British secret service.Otley blunders his way across four hilarious novels by author Waddell and the movie is a pretty good version of the first even with those aggravating changes movies always seem obliged to make. In this one the smalltime deal in antiques crashes a friend's party and slips a small object d'art into his pocket not knowing it contains a miniature taperecorder with a recording a lot of people will kill to possess. Among the changes in the story is a very funny chase sequence when Otley is taking his driving test with an increasingly desperate driving instructor James Cossins.For the rest of the cast Romy Schneider is a lovely Imogen though the character is called Grace in the book and seems to be designed with Diana Rigg in mindhow perfect she would have been! James Villiers Edward Hardwicke Alan Badel and Leonard Rossiter all lend their usual level of professionalism to the proceedings. Dump the lovely Schneider and you have the makings of a great Shakespeare flick. Not only that thenchild actor Kenneth Cranham has a funny little bit. And Indiana Jones' favorite Nazi Ronald Lacy has a good but small part as a hypchonriacal hitman. And the Likely Lads' James Bolam. They've plugged every part with a rising talent. The great Freddie Jones is particularly amusing as the fey leader of a news agencycumspy ring. The episodes between Courtney and Jones are the best in the movie.And yet the Otley movie as a whole never seems quite as good as the sum of its parts. It's like a series of sketches all featuring Courtney's Otley. There's Otley taking his driving exam. There's Otley humping pig swill on Leonard Rossiter's farm. Part of this is Martin Waddell's fault. His Otley books do read like a series of events held together as a narrative by Otley's wonderfully understated firstperson description of the ever deeper holes he finds himself in. Losing the narration for the movie they have the same problem prevalent with P.G. Wodehouse or Jerome K. Jerome adaptations in that the narration is often the best part. They also try to cash in on the swinging London craze current at the time. Well frankly so did Waddell though for whatever reason he made it clear that at least to the secret service Otley himself had far rightwing proclivities which is good news to rightwing readers like me who have so few heroes of my ilk in fiction.Still as with about seventyfive percent of cases the book is better though it requires some thought which movies do not. And for those movie goers who can read chasing down the scarce OTLEY novel will lead to a worthwhile experience though its price is steep on the secondhand market.Too bad. I'd have given it 1010 with Diana Rigg.".
